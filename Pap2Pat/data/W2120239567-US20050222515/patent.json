    "abstract": "Devices, systems and methods of analyzing patient's heart, which are particularly focused on noninvasive techniques of interpreting cardiovascular sounds allow cost-effective and quick diagnosis at the early stages of cardiac dysfunctions. They are equally applicable to adult and pediatric patients. The invention recognizes that effective detection of abnormal cardiovascular sounds and heart lesions can be significantly enhanced by techniques, systems and computer media format that allow to present cardiovascular sounds in time and frequency while keeping signal resolution equally strong in both directions. Invention describes the format and method of constructing it to present the patient's cardiovascular sounds for the detection, identification and prognostication of the heart diseases. A truly unique and novel characteristic of the heart energy signature is its self-referencing feature. Additional benefits include the ability to evaluate heart changes as treatment or disease progresses and to provide unified format for the electronic storage of heart auscultation and cardiac exam findings.",

                        "The present invention generally relates to devices, systems and methods for diagnosing and/or treating of the heart diseases.",
                        "In the particular embodiment, the invention provides techniques for converting normal and abnormal cardiovascular sounds into self-referencing visual images; format for storage and display of the signature of the heart sound energy in the electronic media and a method of processing of this signature to derive substantial clinical conclusions. Cardiovascular sounds include heart sounds, Korotkoff sounds, arterial, carotid artery, jugular veins, coronary or venous pulses. Sounds can be collected externally to the body or internally using electro-acoustic, piezoelectric, skin vibration and ultrasound methods.",
                        "Presently, the use of a fingerprint, an iris measurement and the DNA to capture very reliable individual identifying characteristics of a patient are well established. It is said that they serve as the unique biometric features of a human. Recently, the biometric features of a patient were expanded to include the patient's digital images obtained by MR scanner and a CT tomograph. The defining characteristic of the biometric features is their static or slowly changing nature. For example, they can slowly change over the life of a patient due to natural growth or disease. The biometric feature does not have to be a static in nature to successfully characterize an individual. A good example of the dynamic or a fast changing biometric feature is a human voice. Although the same individual can vary his or her voice widely, it still can be used to identify that individual. The present invention further expands the class of the individual biometric features to include the signature of the cardiovascular (heart) sound energy. For the purposes of this patent we extend the definition of the heart sound to include all the sounds that can be heard or otherwise detected and are originated from the cardiovascular tract.",
                        "Many heart diseases can cause changes in cardiovascular sounds and produce additional murmurs before other signs and symptoms appear. Hence, auscultation (the interpretation by a physician of cardiovascular sounds) and the phonocardiogram (PCG) are two fundamental tools in the diagnosis of heart diseases. The skill to detect and diagnose the heart problem by auscultation and phonocardiogram can take years to acquire and refine. In essence, auscultation relies on: \n\n\n- - hearing many cardiovascular sounds, including short-term changes in\n    the them\n  - correctly determining the correspondence of the primary\n    cardiovascular sounds\n  - detecting the correct sequence of the cardiovascular sounds that are\n    closely spaced in time\n  - distinguishing the cardiovascular sounds from the irrelevant and\n    always present background noise",
                        "It is documented in the medical literature that primary care physicians, residents and medical students are not adequately trained to perform the auscultation. In many cases two experienced cardiologists can often arrive at different conclusions. In addition, the human ear cannot hear many cardiovascular sounds emitted above and below of the audible frequency range, which, for an average human, is between 50 Hz and 14,000 Hertz (\u201cHz\u201d). Many cardiovascular sounds are below 50 Hz frequency. Human ear also has the ability to phase certain signals out and interprets higher pitch sounds \u201clouder\u201d in comparison with lower pitch sounds that dominate the heart sound spectrum.",
                        "Recently, computer-aided auscultation methods were proposed and implemented by the Inovise Inc., and Zargis Medical Systems. Unfortunately, these methods and systems do in fact eliminate a physician out of the bed-side auscultation process, and rely on statistical or empirical waveform analysis to determine certain patterns in the sounds. These methods do not perform well with noisy signals, do not work with the stethoscope, and can not be utilized by the individual doctor in conjunction with the stethoscope during the act of the cardiac exam. Their diagnosis premises require extensive validation and, for this reason, are not currently acceptable for patient care reimbursement by the Medicare and major HMO. See, for example \u201cAcoustic Heart Sound Recording and Computer Analysis\u201d, (August 2004), Aetna Inc. Clinical Policy Bulletin #0692, (consisting of 2 pages).",
                        "The existing methods and techniques for manual and computer-aided auscultation have significant disadvantages. New auscultation interpretation methods need to be developed that can work in conjunction with the physician's stethoscope or in conjunction with any other sound collecting sensor or device. The main objective of such a method and system should be to empower the physician to perform cardiac exam more effectively, reduce time and cost of the diagnosis and to considerably improve patient access to the healthcare system.",

                        "To overcome the challenges of the auscultation, the technique of phonocardiography has been used to visualize the cardiovascular sounds. As indicated by Bredesen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,108 and Johnson in U.S. Pat. No. 5,025,809, the phonocardiograph, the device used in phonocardiography, usually displays a time plot of the heart sounds called PCG signal. Phonocardiograph can also be enhanced with the spectral processing of the cardiovascular sounds as indicated in work done by Bennett in U.S. Pat. No. 4,967,760, Mohler in U.S. Pat. No. 6,053,872 and Kudriavtsev, V. V., et al.

                        "Mohler in U.S. Pat. No. 4,967,760 defines sonospectrography as the separation and arrangement of the frequency components of acoustic signals in terms of energy or time. Spectrograms were originally developed by McCusik, V. A. et al. (\u201cOn Cardiovascular Sound\u201d, 1955, Circulation 11:849) and later used by Winer, D. E. et al. (\u201cHeart sound analysis: A three dimensional approach\u201d, Am. J. Cardiol. 16:547, (1965)). Brief review on the subject is given by Tavel M. E. (\u201cClinical Phonocardiography and External Pulse Recording\u201d, 2nd Ed, Year Book Medical Publishers, p. 19, (1972)). Acoustic spectrograms have not been actively used in the practice of medical care due to their inherent disadvantages. They are based on short term window Fast Fourier Transform (\u201cFFT\u201d) or it's another derivative called Gabor transform. They are not mathematically unique, they are window dependent techniques and one can easily generate very different looking image representations for the very same heart sound. They also suffer from the inability to provide simultaneous resolution in both time and frequency. As a result, the final time frequency dependencies can be inaccurate, difficult to interpret and are prone to errors. Most recent use of the spectrograms was shown in the textbook by T. A. Don Michael (\u201cAuscultation of the Heart, McGraw Hill, pp. 1-404, (1998)) and mainly for the illustration purposes. Acoustic spectrograms presented in the book do not provide sufficient frequency resolution and thus add very little towards the separation and understanding of the cardiac events.",

No. 4,679,570 disclose phonocardiography with signal processing and visual output. Semmlow et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,036,857 discloses a method of phonocardiography with piezoelectric transducer and recommends against FFT analysis of the heart sounds.",
                        "The major problem with all types of the phonocardiograph devices disclosed up to date is that heart sound signals are often contaminated with noise and it is often very hard to differentiate them using visual or computer methods. Displays are often recorded continuously in time and the segmentation and identification of the important components of the cardiovascular sounds are not performed. Thus, the physician faces the challenge to visually determine the components of the cardiovascular sounds. This is not an easy task, and is usually time consuming and error prone.",
                        "Detailed visual analysis of the pre-recorded sound is also difficult and subject to error, requires accumulation of the \u2018interpretation experiences\u2019, especially difficult in noisy environments (non-clean recordings) or with the lower grade hardware. These noisy environments seem to dominate in many practical settings, including body noise (bowel, breathing, indigestion), emergency room (\u201cER\u201d) noise and electrical and radio interference noises. Several statistical and deterministic (\u201cmatrix\u201d) methods were also developed to differentiate such signals. First such approaches were exemplified by Durnin R. E., et al. (\u201cHeart-sound screening in children\u201d, JAMA, Vol. 203, pp. 111-116, (1968)) and Ninova P. P. et al. (\u201cAutomated phonocardiograph screening for heart disease in children\u201d, Cardiology, Vol. 63, pp. 5-13, 1978). In 1993 Bredesen in U.S. Pat. No. 5,218,969 suggested similar \u201cmatrix\u201d semi-empirical methods that are in part based on the heart physiology. Most latest works included neural networks and are presented by Watrous et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,572,560 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,937 and DeGroff et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,937 and DeGroff, C. G. et al. (\u201cArtificial Neural Network-BasedMethod of Screening Heart Murmurs in Children\u201d, Circulation, 2001;103:2711-2716). All of them require extensive calibration or rely on empirical statistics and do not provide any fundamental explanation of the diagnostic solution or easy interpretation of the patient's data.",

                        "All of the above referenced analyses have utilized Cohen class time-frequency methods (Wigner, pseudo Wigner Ville, Binomial, and Choi-Williams distributions) to study cardiovascular sounds. However, they have only utilized a small segment of a single heart beat (for example S1 or S2 sound components), and were not including prolonged time intervals in their studies. Prolonged time intervals that are at least one heart beat long or contain several heart beats are required to properly reflect on heart sound changes during the inspiration-expiration cycle. Thus, the above referenced articles are of limited utility for the practical diagnosis. Stankovic L. and Djurovic I. (\u201cA Note on\u201d An Overview of Aliasing Errors in Discrete-Time Formulations of Time-Frequency Representations\u201d, IEEE Trans. on Signal Proc., Vol. 49, No. 1, pp. 257-259, (2001)) were motivated to develop yet another time-frequency transform due to the perception of a poor quality of the Wigner-Ville image due to aliasing and cross-interference terms errors.

                        "It appears that the difficulty in interpreting time-frequency representations of the cardiovascular sounds facing the researchers and inventors in the field is due to the lack of the defined format (standard) or characteristic signature for the heart sound. The researchers and inventors are lacking a proper basis for comparison of the results of their studies. The situation is reminiscent of the invention of the periodic table of chemical elements by Mendeleev. At the time of his invention, many chemical elements were well-known and studied. However, by proper grouping of the chemical elements into a new representation format, a significant breakthrough in the chemistry and physics was achieved. New patterns of the relationship between the chemical elements became evident, which led to discovery of many new elements and new properties.",

Also none of these patents and the publications discloses a format to represent, display and to store the signature of the heart sound and the method of obtaining such format. Further, none of the above patents and publications discloses the method to utilize the heart sound energy signatures for the detection, identification, time evolution and prognosis of the heart conditions and their changes."

                        "The present invention provides improved devices, systems and methods for performing auscultation of the heart with the help of signal processing techniques based on the theory of system science. The techniques of the present invention are particularly useful for the detection of the characteristic signatures of the heart sound energy typical to congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, innocent systolic murmurs in children, atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, heart murmur classification, normal and abnormal splits in the cardiovascular sounds, diastolic gallop, atrial sound, quadruple gallop and systolic and diastolic clicks.",
                        "The present invention describes the format and method of constructing it to present the patient's cardiovascular sounds for the detection, identification and prognostication of the heart diseases. The main element of the format is the image of the heart sound energy given simultaneously in time and frequency and obtained using sound signal transformation into a joint time-frequency domain. Above image of the heart sound energy is obtained for the time duration period that exceeds or equal to one heart beat of a given living subject. A heartbeat is a single complete pulsation of the heart, consisting of a complete cardiac contraction-relaxation sequence, and produces different sound patterns at different auscultation or sensor locations. By presenting cardiovascular sound in this form, a new biometric signature of the patient is obtained. It is named as the signature of the heart sound energy. A truly novel characteristic of the heart sound energy signature is its self-referencing feature that allows easy qualitative and visual differentiation of the normal heart signature from all the deviant or abnormal heart signatures.",
                        "Signature of the heart sound energy can generate several derivative functions that characterize heart energy density spectrum and time varying power. When combined with the original signal of the cardiovascular sound the above indicated elements form the heart energy signature format (HESF).",
                        "Heart energy signature format offers a tremendous promise to become de-facto standard of exchanging heart medical data, heart auscultation data and of analyzing these data in cardiac devices, characterization, diagnosis and medical practices, even for home care.",
                        "This promise is due to many of heart sound energy signature features: \n\n\n- a) it is self-referencing;\n- b) it allows precise mathematical and mechanical characterization of\n  heart pulsations in real-time and in stand alone post-test modes;\n- c) it is mathematically unique;\n- d) it is easy for the physician, operator or patient to understand and\n  to interpret;\n- e) it is portable, can be stored and transmitted on/between the\n  variety of media (desktop computers, PDA);\n- f) organizers, visual cell phones, laptops, palmtops and can be simply\n  printed on the paper)\n- g) it allows continuous time monitoring to evaluate longer term\n  changes\n- h) it can be implemented as the algorithm, digital format and software\n  and be always reduced to a graphical image.",
                        "The invention provides, in one aspect, the method for coding and estimating the signature of the heart sound energy out of a typical cardiovascular sound dataset. Because of the limitations imposed by the present memory and speed of the computing hardware it is presently not possible to consider limitless length of the corresponding sound dataset. To address above limitations an enhanced method was invented. The preferred embodiment of the method allows implementing size down-sampling and proportional extension of the energy signature time duration using the method of wavelet downsampling or any other method that will not lead to a loss or alteration of the initial signal. An alternative embodiment implements block-by-block computation of the joint time frequency transformation algorithm that allows covering larger time durations using the plurality of short time duration chunks of data.",
                        "In the exemplary embodiment of the present method a pseudo Wigner-Ville joint time frequency transformation is utilized to obtain a signature of the heart sound energy for a given time duration. This time duration covers at least one heart beat. Alternative embodiments include all other Cohen class and higher order joint time frequency transformations such as Margenau-Hill, Choi-Williams, or modified pseudo Wigner-Ville as described by Stankovic L. and Djurovic I.

                        "Since filing the provisional patent U.S. Pat. No. 60/546,742 all the preferred and alternative embodiments were reduced to practice by the inventors in the BSignal software that is currently marketed by the Biosignetics Corporation.",
                        "One preferred aspect of the invention includes the method and format for evaluating heart energy signature changes in time on the test by test basis. This is a very important feature that is currently not available in the existing medical practice. Such a feature will lead to a new data and new discoveries that were not possible by any other methods or even by other technology modes.",
                        "In another aspect, the invention provides methods and formats for storing and displaying characteristic heart energy signature in the electronic media. Proper storage and display of the relevant information and energy signature components leads to the effective and rapid diagnosis and recognition sequence. We have developed above methods using the experimentation with various cardiovascular sounds representing different diseases, recording equipment and patient types.",
                        "In yet another aspect, the present invention provides the system for processing and identification of the new characteristic features of the heart energy signature. This system is based on relating all new characteristic features obtained through the use of signature of the heart sound energy with the existing principles of cardiac auscultation. It is expanded through the use of look-up method of comparing currently obtained heart sound energy signature format against the organized database of similarly structured data using simply visual identification method or using computerized pattern recognition algorithms. It can be implemented in the computer software, training system, database or as a set of manually guided steps."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "While the following description is largely directed to the utilization and processing of the heart sounds, the methods, devices and systems of the present invention may be used for the analysis of a variety of cardiovascular sounds (such as Korotkoff sounds, arterial and venous pulses) and other biological body sounds including indigestion and bowel sounds, baby sounds, fetal and fetal cardiovascular sounds. The invention is well suited to characterize animal cardiovascular and heart sounds, including heart sounds of horses, dogs and cats.",
                        "The sounds heard over the cardiac region are produced by the functioning heart. There are four distinct sounds: the first (S1) occurs at the beginning of systole and is heard as a \u201club\u201d sound; the second (S2) is produced by the closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves and is heard as a \u201cdub\u201d sound; the third (S3) is produced by vibrations of the ventricular walls when suddenly distended by the rush of blood from the atria; and the fourth (S4) is produced by arterial contraction and ventricular filling. Other cardiovascular sounds may include simpler pulse components.",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 1, we shall describe the morphology and visual representation of the signature of the heart sound energy for a single heart beat. A generic signature is represented by the graphical image 100 and is shown in time axis 20 and frequency axis 10. It is bounded by left 70 and right 80 temporal boundaries, thus defining its time duration. First heart sound, S1 30, and second heart sound S2 40 are shown schematically, with systolic murmur shown as element 50, third heart sound S3 is shown as element 60 and fourth heart sound S4 is shown as element 65. Depending on a specific heart sound, any additional elements may or may not be present on the signature of the heart sound energy.",
                        "Morphologically energy plot 100 consists of the same key elements as the heart sound, i.e. it includes S1 and S2 heart sound normal components superimposed with additional abnormal sound components. S1 30 and S2 40 components of the energy plot are very easy to identify and visualize. Normal heart follows typical \u201club-dub\u201d pattern with S1 being \u201club\u201d and S2 being \u201cdub\u201d, and thus operator skilled in arts will mostly see S1 30 and S2 40 energy blobs when examining sounds obtained from the normal heart. The additional abnormal sounds are typically characteristic of the diseased heart and may include S3 60 and S4 65 components, systolic and diastolic murmur's components, snaps and clicks components of the signature of the heart sound energy. Each energy blob or component of the energy plot 100 becomes in fact a characteristic element of the heart sound energy signature when shown in a visual format as referred in FIG. 1. Each such component is represented as a dark blob on the image of the heart energy. Heart murmurs are typically seen as several smaller blobs connected together into a \u201cweave\u201d or small blobs located behind the S1 blob 30 or behind the S2 blob 40.",
                        "Energy plot has clearly defined temporal borders 70 and 80 that define the beginning and the end of the heart sound energy signature (\u201cHSES\u201d). It shows zones where energy is dissipated on a joint time 20 and frequency 10 plot 100. It is thus clearly showing timing and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of each above referenced heart sound components (30, 40, 50, 60, 65) and allows close monitoring of all significant changes in the heart operation. Such changes may occur due to medical treatment, worsening of conditions, artificial implants, medications, hyper-conditions, nervousness associated with tests and even mental situations/crisis.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1, the heart sound energy signature morphology is self-referencing. That is, it extends itself to an immediate examination without having another reference and allows a visual detection of all key abnormalities associated with the sounds or vibrations emitted by the heart. When energy plot is extended to include several heart beats, the system operator can immediately identify pulse duration (by estimating the duration of repetitive patterns (such as HSES 100), pulse irregularity (by examining HSES time durations).",
                        "Plot of heart sound amplitude versus time is called phonocardiogram (\u201cPCG\u201d). Referring now to FIG. 2A, the variation of the heart sound amplitude with time is clearly evident. An example of PCG shown in FIG. 2A depicts eight heart beats each consisting of S1 and S2 components. Signal amplitude variation in time is a characteristic heart sound feature that is due to respiration. Signal components 130 and 110 show maximum signal amplitude and according to Tavel, M. E. (\u201cClinical Phonocardiography and External Pulse Recording, Year Book Medical Publishers, (1972)) are identifiable with expiration. Signal component 120 has lower amplitude and is identifiable with inspiration. Graphical window 200 allows to further zoom into the sound details which are shown on FIG. 2B. They include two neighboring heart beats. This exemplary embodiment includes S1 sound waveform 141, S2 sound waveform 142, S3 sound waveform 143, and S4 sound waveform 144. Systolic time interval 180 is located between the S1 heart sound 141 and S2 heart sound 142, and diastolic time interval 190 is bounded by the S2 heart sound 142 on the left and the next S1 heart sound 150 on the right. S2 heart sound 160 is shown in so-called split format. Elements 151 shows aortic and 152 shows pulmonary component of the S2 heart sound 160. S2 heart sound 142 is not split. Normal heart sound S2 splits with respiration. Splitting of S2 typically happens on inspiration and reaches its maximum time duration when the sound amplitude is minimal.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2C, above described phonocardiographic representation of the cardiovascular sounds 200 is graphically presented as the heart sound energy signature image 210 in time and frequency dimensions. S1 heart sound 161, is followed by the S2 heart sound 162, followed by S3 heart sound 163, followed by S4 heart sound 164. They comprise the first heart beat 160. Systolic period is shown as 180, diastolic period is shown as 190. Second heart beat 181 includes S1 sound 171, and aortic component of S2 sound 172 which is separated by a short time period from the pulmonary component 173, thus, showing S2 sound split on the heart sound energy signature image 210.",
                        "The heart sound energy plot 100, as referred on FIG. 1, and characteristic plot 210, as referred on FIG. 2C, represent a unique state of dynamically changing multi-component signal of the heart beat. The plurality of the elements 30, 40, 50, 60, shown on FIG. 1, or the plurality of the elements 161, 162, 163, 164, 171, 172, 173, shown on FIG. 2C, constitutes a visual representation of the signature of the heart sound energy.",
                        "Plots referenced on FIG. 1 and on FIG. 2C can utilize various color mapping schemes to indicate changes in the absolute value of the heart sound energy. For the purposes of this patent application we demonstrate black-and-white color scheme. The person skilled in art of image processing can implement many traditional color mapping schemes (gray scale, temperature, red-green-blue, etc.) or non-traditional color mapping schemes to represent heart sound energy signature plot visually.",
                        "Hereinafter, the term \u201cheart sound energy signature\u201d will refer to the image or mathematical representation of the image of the time-frequency representation of the heart sound signal that is bounded in time and is at least one heartbeat long in duration. The term \u201cheart sound energy\u201d will refer to the unbounded time intervals or to the time durations that are shorter than a single heart beat.",
                        "The above defined heart sound energy signature 100 is intended for use as an individual biometric characteristic for the purposes of heart diagnosis. A new plurality of elements 300 characterizing heart sound can now be assembled. It is comprised from the initial sound signal input 320, heart sound energy signature plot 310 and of various derivative outputs generated from the 310. This new plurality is best fit for the sound based heart diagnosis and will be defined as the heart sound energy signature format 300.",
                        "As referred on FIG. 3, the above introduced format 300 utilizes heart sound energy signature time-frequency distribution plot 310, normalized heart sound signal 320, original heart sound as recorded 330, spectral characteristic of the sound 330 obtained via FFT 340, heart sound power 350 and heart energy density spectrum 370 and instantaneous heart sound signal power 360 for any selected frequency and instantaneous density spectrum 380 for any selected moment in time. All above components of the heart sound energy signature format are given for an operator defined time period of the energy signature. This period is at least one heart beat long. The above formulated format 300 must represent a pseudo-periodic portion of the heart sound containing any of the sound components referred on FIG. 1 and FIG. 2C.

That is, normalization makes the data instrument and measurement independent. The amplitude of the cardiovascular sounds can vary widely depending on the location of the sensor used and the measurement system (phonocardiograph, electronic stethoscope, etc).

This dc-component is removed from the heart sound signal. It is done in two steps. At first the mean value of the heartbeat signal is computed, and secondly this mean value is subtracted from the heartbeat signal. To standardize the comparison of the heartbeat sounds in the time domain, they are normalized to have their amplitude vary between [\u22121,+1]. The process of normalization of the signal x(t) to [\u22121,+1] amplitude range is well known in mathematical arts.

Memory limitations specifically define strong restrictions on the sample size for the transformation, thus limiting heart energy matrix to a very short time interval. Such interval is typically of no use for the diagnosis.

Steps 522, 523, 524, 525 describe the process of computation of a Hilbert Transform. Additional steps, 526 and 527 are required to form an analytic signal from the Hilbert Transform. An analytic signal is a complex signal and is obtained in step 527. As a first step in computing a Hilbert Transform, a real signal 521 is obtained and Fourier Transform of the real signal is computed in step 522. It is subsequently multiplied by a factor of two in step 523, all negative frequencies are zeroed 524 and then inverse Fourier transform 525. The result of step 525 is a Hilbert Transform. An imaginary part of Hilbert Transform is subsequently selected in step 526 and a complex signal (analytic signal) is formed in step 527 using also the input of the real signal 521.

This process is absolutely required for the subsequent clinical interpretation of the heart sound and of the heart energy signature and format Sound segmentation utilizes key heart energy signature components such as time frequency sound energy display 1510, integral power display 1520 and heart sound display 1530. Segmentation method allows to establish a unique correspondence between the heart sound display waveforms, their heart sound energy equivalents, to estimate systolic and diastolic periods, and to name appropriate heart sound components (such as S1, S2, S3, S4 and murmurs).",

If murmur is systolic then diastolic interval can be utilized to identify S1 and S2, and if murmur is diastolic then systolic interval can be utilized to identify S1 and S2. Heart beat count serves as important check verification for the invented segmentation method. Durations of the S1 1523, S2 1524 and of systolic 1512 and diastolic 1522 periods form one time interval that is equal to the length of a single heart beat 1547. Heart beat duration 1547 can be estimated by a person skilled in art of pattern recognition by the identification of repetitive multi-component patterns on the heart sound energy plot 1510 and on the heart signal power plot 1530.",

However, methods that are based on the heart sound signal (1540) can be prone to errors and uncertainties that are due to the noisiness of the heart sound signal and also due to the uncertain visual and signal representation of many different murmurs. This noisiness and uncertainness completely disappear when the heart sound energy 1510 and heart sound power 1530 are utilized for the segmentation method. In rare cases of high intensity murmurs known in cardiology as \u201cChristmas trees\u201d or when S1 sound is very weak, or when the sound is widely split heart sound signal 1540 will be required to confirm segmentation findings, such as for example a comparison of the item 160 with the 175. Item 175 shows two energy blobs identifying split S2, item 160 illustrates signal representation of the split S2 heart sound and confirms that it is in fact split S2 heart sound. Thus, invented segmentation method uses 1510, 1530 and 1540 representations simultaneously. All these representations are derived from the original heart sound.",

It presumes that album or database of pre-selected signatures for normal heart sound and various diseases is available and operator can compare any newly obtained signature with the existing state of the art. It stores all available components of the heart energy signature format in categories typical of various heart conditions known to the person skillful in art of cardiac auscultation.",

Operator starts with checking for number of primary energy blobs such as S1 411 and S2 412 as referred in FIG. 4 and locations, intensities, time durations and frequency ranges of the secondary blobs (murmurs). Database may contain also additional data such as case histories, explanations of disease manifestations, and other useful information. Data can also include heart energy signature formats for several auscultation positions for each corresponding case. Database referred in FIG. 16 can be effectively utilized in the training and education environments, where diagnosis is performed for the training purposes and developing certain clinical diagnosis skills. It can also be useful in the clinical point of care applications when physician may need an additional confirmation or aid in his diagnosis. Such system can be utilized in the stand alone mode in various auscultation training programs. It combines cardiovascular sounds, signal plots and other heart energy signature characteristic elements for the complete characterization of the patient."
