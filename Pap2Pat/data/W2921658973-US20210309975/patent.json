                        "Despite their therapeutic potential, the production of pharmaceutical grade (>99%) cannabinoids still face major technical challenges. Cannibis plants like marijuana and hemp produce high levels of tetrahydrocannabinolic (THCA) and cannibidiolic acid (CBDA), along with a variety of lower abundance cannabinoids. However, even highly expressed cannabinoids like CBDA and THCA, are challenging to isolate due to the high structural similarity of contaminating cannabinoids and the variability of cannabinoid composition with each crop. These problems are magnified when attempting to isolate rare cannabinoids. Moreover, current cannabis farming practices present serious environmental challenges. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing alternative methods for the production of cannabinoids and cannabinoid analogs."

                        "Prenylation (also known as isoprenylation or lipidation) is the addition of hydrophobic molecules to a protein or chemical compound. It is usually assumed that prenyl groups (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl) facilitate attachment to cell membranes, similar to lipid anchors like the GPI anchor. Prenyl groups have been shown to be important for protein-protein binding through specialized prenyl-binding domains.",
                        "Prenylated natural products are a large class of bioactive molecules with demonstrated medicinal properties. Examples include prenyl-flavanoids, prenyl-stilbenoids, and cannabinoids. Plant-derived prenylcompounds are difficult to isolate due to the structural similarity of contaminating molecules, and the variable composition between crops. These challenges are further exacerbated when attempting to isolate low abundance compounds. Many chemical syntheses have been developed to address the challenges associated with making prenylated natural products, but they are generally impractical for drug manufacturing due to the degree of complexity and low yields.",
                        "Microbial production is a useful alternative to natural extraction for prenylated natural products, but comes with many challenges such as the need to divert carbon flux from central metabolism and product toxicity to name a few. For example, prenyl-natural products like prenyl-naringenin, prenyl-resveratrol, and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) are derived from a combination of the metabolic pathways for fatty acid, isoprenoid, and polyketide biosynthesis. So, high-level production requires efficient rerouting of long, essential and highly regulated pathways. Despite the challenges, many groups have engineered microbes to produce unprenylated polyketides, like naringenin, resveratrol, and olivetolate, but at relatively low levels (110, 391, and 80 mg/L, respectively). Obtaining prenylated products is even more challenging because geranyl-pyrophosphate (GPP) is an essential metabolite that is toxic to cells at moderate concentrations, creating a significant barrier for high-level microbial production.",
                        "Cannabinoids in particular show immense therapeutic potential with over 100 ongoing clinical trials as antiemetics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and analgesics. Nevertheless, despite the therapeutic potential of prenyl-natural products, their study and use is limited by the lack of cost-effective production methods.",
                        "The two main alternatives to plant-based cannabinoid production are organic synthesis and production in a metabolically engineered host (e.g., plant, yeast, or bacteria). Total syntheses have been elucidated for the production of some cannabinoids, such as THCA and CBDA, but they are often not practical for drug manufacturing. Additionally, the synthetic approach is not modular, requiring a unique synthesis for each cannabinoid. A modular approach could be achieved by using the natural biosynthetic pathway.",
                        "The three major cannabinoids (THCA, CBDA and cannibichromene or CBCA) are derived from a single precursor, CBGA. Additionally, three low abundance cannabinoids are derived from CBGVA (FIG. 1A). Thus, the ability to make CBGA and CBGVA in a heterologous host would open the door to the production of an array of cannabinoids. Unfortunately, engineering microorganisms to produce CBGA and CBGVA has proven extremely challenging.",
                        "Cannabinoids are derived from a combination of fatty acid, polyketide, and terpene biosynthetic pathways that generate the key building blocks geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and olivetolic acid (OA) (FIG. 1A). High level CBGA biosynthesis requires the re-routing of long, essential and highly regulated pathways. Moreover, GPP is toxic to cells, creating a notable barrier to high level production in microbes. While Gagne et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 109:12811, 2012) engineered a pathway to produce OA in yeast, the titers were very low (0.5 mg L-1), suggesting that high level production of intermediates on the pathway is not straightforward. In a separate study, Zirpel et al. produced THCA in a yeast lysate containing the promiscuous prenyltransferase (NphB) and THCA synthase, supplemented with GPP and olivetolic acid (OA) (J. Biotechnol., 259:204-212, 2017). Yet, there are still no published reports of cannabinoid production in engineered live cells from low cost feedstocks.",
                        "Synthetic biochemistry, in which complex biochemical conversions are performed cell-free using a mixture of enzymes, affords potential advantages over traditional metabolic engineering including: a higher level of flexibility in pathway design; greater control over component optimization; more rapid design-build-test cycles; and freedom from cell toxicity of intermediates or products. The disclosure provides a cell-free system for the production of cannabinoids.",
                        "This disclosure provides enzyme variants and pathways comprising such variants for the prenylation of compounds including the production of cannabinoids. In addition, the biosynthetic pathways described herein use \u201cpurge valves\u201d to regulate NAD(P)H levels.

WO2017/015429, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). These purge valves were used to upgrade and diversify the original system to produce complex natural products like cannabinoids.

NphB exhibits a rich substrate selectivity and product regioselectivity. NphB, identified from Streptomyces, catalyzes the addition of a 10-carbon geranyl group to a number of small organic aromatic substrates. NphB has a spacious and solvent accessible binding pocket in to which two substrates molecules, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and 1,6-dihydroxynaphthalene (1,6-DHN), can be bound. GPP is stabilized via interactions between its negatively charged diphosphate moiety and several amino acid sidechains, including Lys119, Thr171, Arg228, Tyr216 and Lys284, in addition to Mg2+. A Mgz2+ cofactor is required for the activity of NphB. NphB from Streptomyces has a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:30.",

The novQ gene can be cloned from Streptomyces niveus, which produces an aminocoumarin antibiotic, novobiocin. Recombinant NovQ can be expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The purified enzyme is a soluble monomeric 40-kDa protein that catalyzed the transfer of a dimethylallyl group to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (4-HPP) independently of divalent cations to yield 3-dimethylallyl-4-HPP, an intermediate of novobiocin. In addition to the prenylation of 4-HPP, NovQ catalyzed carbon-carbon-based and carbon-oxygen-based prenylations of a diverse collection of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and dihydroxynaphthalenes. Despite its catalytic promiscuity, the NovQ-catalyzed prenylation occurred in a regiospecific manner. NovQ is the first reported prenyltransferase capable of catalyzing the transfer of a dimethylallyl group to both phenylpropanoids, such as p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid, and the B-ring of flavonoids. NovQ can serve as a useful biocatalyst for the synthesis of prenylated phenylpropanoids and prenylated flavonoids.",

About 400 mg/L (1.3 mM) of prenylated product was obtained when starting with 2.5 mM 1,6 DHN and 500 mM glucose. However, when the starting 1,6 DHN concentration was increased from 2.5 to 5 mM, final titers decreased 2-fold suggesting that 1,6 DHN was inhibiting one or more enzymes. Enzyme assays revealed that E. coli pyruvate dehydrogenase (EcPDH) was inhibited by not only 1,6 DHN, but several other aromatic polyketides (FIG. 2B). At 1 mM of either 1,6 DHN, olivetol, or resveratrol the activity of PDH decreased 2-fold (FIG. 2B). Thus, experiments were designed to eliminate PDH by implementing a PDH bypass (see FIGS. 1A and 2B). In the PDH bypass, pyruvate was converted to acetyl-CoA using pyruvate oxidase (PyOx) and acetyl-phosphate transferase (PTA) thereby eliminating PDH (FIG. 1A). As shown in FIG. 2A the new system removed the inhibition seen at higher concentrations of 1,6 DHN and increased titers of 5-prenyl-1,6 DHN 4-fold over the PDH system when starting at 5 mM 1,6 DHN (FIG. 2B). FIG. 2C shows a time course of 5-prenyl-1,6 DHN biosynthesis starting with 5 mM 1,6 DHN utilizing the PDH bypass. Approximately 50% of the 1,6 DHN was converted in the first 24 hours, ultimately reaching a final titer of 705\u00b112 mg/L.",
                        "The prenylation of aromatic polyketides by NphB is thought to proceed through a carbocation intermediate in which the first step is dissociation of diphosphate from GPP to create a carbocation on the C1 carbon of GPP, which subsequently attacks a nearby nucleophile. To improve the regiospecificity of prenyl-transfer, OA was modeled into the active site of NphB using the crystal structure of NphB in complex with 1,6 DHN, Mg2+ and a nonhydrolyzable analog of GPP (geranyl S-thiolodiphosphate) as a starting point (PDBID 1ZB6; Protein Data Bank reference 1ZB6). For the design, OA was placed into the binding pocket using 1,6 DHN as a guide, situating the desired prenylation site, the C3 carbon of OA, 3.7 \u212b above the nascent geranyl C1 carbocation (FIG. 3A). The distance chosen was based on the distance of the C5 carbon of 1,6 DHN to the C1 carbon of GPP. Residues in contact with OA were then varied using ROSETTA software to optimize the active site of NphB for binding OA. Side chains in contact with GPP or that potentially provide catalytic function were left fixed. The result was an ensemble of suggested NphB variants.",
                        "To reduce the number of variants to test experimentally, changes likely to have the most significant impact on OA binding were ranked using a scoring system. A representative group of variants were picked (Table 1) and each residue was systematically changed back to the wild-type side chain in the background of the other mutations, and the change evaluated in the energy score (Table 2). Y288 replacements had the largest impact on the energy score so Y288A or the Y288N mutation were used in every construct evaluated experimentally. The frequency of mutation, how multiple mutations might work in concert, and the computational energy score to further shape the NphB library were all considered. With these considerations, a library comprised of 29 constructs ranging from a single point mutant to up to 6 mutations per construct was generated as set forth in Table 1 (see also SEQ ID Nos: 1-29; note SEQ ID Nos: 1-29 include a hexahistidine leader from the expression construct, i.e., amino acids 1-20, which are not necessary for biological activity).",
                        "Recombinant methods for producing and isolating modified NphB polypeptides of the disclosure are described herein. In addition to recombinant production, the polypeptides may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (e.g., Stewart et al. (1969) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (WH Freeman Co, San Francisco); and Merrifield (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85: 2149-2154; each of which is incorporated by reference). Peptide synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.",
                        "Crudely purified NphB mutants were obtained and an initial screen was performed for CBGA production using GPP and OA at concentrations that were saturating for wild-type NphB. Six constructs were identified that had >10-fold apparent increase in activity (M1, M2, M3, M6, M10 and M15) and 4 constructs that had 2-10-fold apparent improvement (M5, M7, M12 and M20) when compared to WT NphB, while the remaining constructs had similar activity to WT NphB. The top hits from the initial screen (M1, M3, M10 and M15) were purified and more carefully characterized (FIG. 3B). Several observations were apparent from the initial screen: (1) Y288A (M1) and Y288N (M2) by themselves dramatically enhanced activity, as predicted by computation; (2) the presence of Y288N in any construct decreased the purification yield suggesting Y288N may be a destabilizing mutation making Y288A a more desirable mutation; (3) the addition of G286S in the Y288N (M10) background appeared to improve activity further over Y288N (M2), suggesting that G286S could be another favorable mutation; (4) a slight activity improvement of Y288A/F213N/A232S (M15) over Y288A (M1), even though F213N had a neutral or deleterious effect in the Y288A/F213N (M5) construct suggesting that A232S may also be a favorable mutation.",
                        "From these initial observations a focused library was designed that included variants Y288A, GS86S and A232S in various combinations. Other combinations with Y288V were added with the rationale that it may improve stability while still reducing the size of the Y288 side chain. All but one of the constructs in the second library exhibited activity at least 100-fold higher than WT NphB in a one hour endpoint assay. A comparison of the best mutants from round one and the best mutants from round two are shown in FIG. 3B. Clearly, the combination of beneficial mutations from round 1 improved CBGA production. Additionally the Y288A and Y288V constructs improved expression of NphB compared to Y288N without sacrificing activity.",
                        "The best two mutants from the initial screen were further characterized as well as the best three constructs from the focused library. The kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 2. While all of the mutants have relatively modest effects on Km, a dramatic improvements in kcat values was observed. M23 (the NphB of SEQ ID NO:23) in particular improved kcat 750-fold from 0.0021\u00b10.00008 min-1 to 1.58\u00b10.05 min\u22121. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for both M23 and M31 were improved over 1000-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. Although M31 had a higher kcat/Km than M23, M23 was employed rather than M31 because M23 had a higher kcat and the synthetic biochemistry system generally operates at saturating OA conditions.",
                        "The designed mutant M23 not only shows dramatically improved catalytic efficiency for prenylation of OA, it is also extremely specific, producing only the correct CBGA product. WT NphB produces CBGA, but the dominant product is a prenylated isomer (FIG. 3C). In contrast the designed mutant M23 makes CBGA almost exclusively. Overall, the designed enzyme is a much more effective CBGA synthase than the non-specific prenylating wild-type enzyme.",

                        "Geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) is then formed from the combination of DMAPP and isopentyl pyrophosphate in the presence of farnesyl-PP synthase having an S82F mutation relative to SEQ ID NO:53. In one embodiment, the farnesyl-diphosphate synthase has a sequence that is at least 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO:53 having an S82F mutation and which is capable of forming geranyl pyrophosphate from DMAPP and isopentyl pyrophosphate.",
                        "GPP can then be used as a substrate for a number of pathways leading to prenyl-flavinoids, geranyl-flavonoics, prenyl-stilbenoids, geranyl-stilbenoids, CBGA, CBGVA, CBDA, CBDVA, CBGVA, CBCVA, THCA and THCVA (see, e.g., FIG. 1A)",
                        "For example, with the NphB mutant, as described above, in hand (e.g., an M23 mutant), the ability to produce CBGA directly from glucose and OA was tested using the full synthetic biochemistry system, including the PDH bypass (see, FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B). The initial productivity using M23 in the system was 67 mg L\u22121 hr\u22121 with a final titer of 744\u00b134 mg L\u22121 of CBGA. This was 100-fold faster than CBGA production using WT NphB, and reached a titer 21-fold higher. It is noted that with the mutant NphB enzyme, maximum titers were reached within 24 hours and the production stopped, yet with the wild-type enzyme, the system ran continuously for up to 4 days suggesting that enzymes and cofactors remain active and viable for longer periods of time. It was noted that once \u02dc500 mg L\u22121 CBGA was produced, the reactions turned cloudy. The precipitate was collected and a mix of enzymes was identified in the precipitate by SDS-PAGE analysis, indicating that high-levels of CBGA in solution causes enzymes to precipitate. A more effective system was developed to remove product during the reaction.",
                        "Although a nonane overlay was used in the reactions to extract CBGA, CBGA is more soluble in water than nonane, which limits the amount of CBGA that can be extracted with a simple overlay. Thus, a flow system was designed that would capture CBGA from the nonane layer and trap it in a separate water reservoir (FIG. 4b). By implementing this flow system a lower concentration of CBGA was maintained in the reaction vessel to mitigate enzyme precipitation. The flow system indeed improved the final titers to 1.2 g/L.",
                        "Experiments were then performed to produce the precursor of many rare cannabinoids, CBGVA, by replacing OA in the system with divirinic acid (DA) (see, e.g., FIG. 1B). The designed enzymes were first tested to determine if they would be active on a DA substrate. The two best mutants M23 and M31 were tested as well as WT NphB for their ability to produce CBGVA. The kinetic data shown in Table 2 indicated that M31 was far superior, with catalytic efficiencies 15-fold higher than M23 and 650-fold higher than WT NphB. Thus, further efforts utilized M31 to produce CBGVA from glucose and divarinic acid. As shown in FIG. 4A, CBGVA was produced at a max productivity of \u02dc 107 mg L\u22121 hr\u22121, and reached a final titer of 1.74\u00b10.09 g L\u22121, converting 92% of the divarinic acid added to CBGVA. The nonane flow system was not needed for the production of CBGVA because CBGVA was less potent in precipitating enzymes.",
                        "To demonstrate that the approach can ultimately be used to prepare additional cannabinoids, CBDA synthase was employed to convert CBGA into CBDA and CBGVA into CBDVA. For CBDA, the nonane overlay contained a significant quantity of CBGA, so by simply transferring the nonane overlay to a solution containing CBDA synthase, CBGA was converted into CBDA at a constant rate of 14.4\u00b10.8 mg L\u22121 hr\u22121 mg\u22121 total protein\u22121 for 4 days.",
                        "Due to the limited solubility of CBGVA in nonane, the CBGVA was extracted and added to a reaction containing CBDA synthase. The product of the CBDA synthase was in fact CBDVA using GC-MS.",

Further the disclosure provides a cell free approach for the production of an array of pure cannabinoids and other prenylated natural products using the GPP pathway in combination with a mutant NphB or using substrates for the mutant NphB of the disclosure. The success of this method uses the engineered prenyltransferase of the disclosure (e.g., NphB mutants as described above), which was active, highly specific and eliminated the need for the native transmembrane prenyltransferase. The modularity and flexibility of the synthetic biochemistry platform provided herein has the benefits of a bio-based approach, but removes the complexities of satisfying living systems. For example, GPP toxicity did not factor into the design process. Moreover, OA is not taken up by yeast so the approach of adding it exogenously would not necessarily be possible in cells. Indeed, the flexibility of cell free systems can greatly facilitate the design-build-test cycles required for further optimization, additional pathway enzymes and reagent and co-factor modifications.",

For example, the isoprenoid module produces the isoprenoid geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) from acetyl-CoA via the mevalonate pathway. The aromatic polyketide module utilizes a Type III polyketide synthase (PKS) to convert hexanoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (derived from acetyl-CoA) into olivetolic acid (OA). The cannabinoid module, uses products from the isoprenoid module and the polyketide module to yield cannabigerolic acid, which is then converted into the final cannabinoid by a cannabinoid synthase.",

Expression vector components suitable for the expression of genes and maintenance of vectors in E. coli, yeast, Streptomyces, and other commonly used cells are widely known and commercially available. For example, suitable promoters for inclusion in the expression vectors of the disclosure include those that function in eukaryotic or prokaryotic host microorganisms.

Alternatively, a protein has homology to a second protein if the two proteins have \u201csimilar\u201d amino acid sequences.

In one embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, typically at least 40%, more typically at least 50%, even more typically at least 60%, and even more typically at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% of the length of the reference sequence.

In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of homology may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Pearson et al., 1994, hereby incorporated herein by reference).",

Olivetolate was placed in the active site of NphB in six different starting positions denoted as Olivetolate P1-6 in Table 4. ROSETTA was run 5 times for each olivetolate position for a total of 30 designs. The mutations predicted in each design are listed in Table 4. For each olivetolate position a consensus set of mutations (i.e., the most frequently chosen residue) was chosen to evaluate further: Consensus Group A through F (Table 4). The relative importance of each ROSSETTA suggested mutation was then evaluated. For each Consensus Group, the mutations were set back to WT residue, one at a time, and used ROSETTA to calculate the change in energy score (see Table 5). Those that caused the largest change in energy were deemed to be the most important mutants to include in the library for experimental testing.",

A rotamer library was generated for olivetolic acid using the Bio Chemical Library (BCL) molecule: Conformer Generator 3.5 using the PDB library. Finally, the aromatic bonds were manually annotated into the file before generating the parameter file read by Rosetta using the script main/source/python/public/molfile_to_params.py in the Rosetta 3.7 release. The parameter file for geranyl s-thioldiphosphate (GST) was generated without a rotamer library using the GST.sdf file from the 1ZB6 crystal structure. The olivetolic acid molecule was then manually placed into the co-crystal structure of NphB with GST and DHN (1ZB6) with the DHN and crystallographic waters removed using pymol. The olivetolic acid was placed in 6 different positions in the active site with the plane of the olivetolate aromatic ring parallel to the GST alkyl tail and the desired prenylation site 3.7 angstroms away from the eventual carbocation mirroring the placement of DHN in the 1ZB6 crystal structure. Residues 49, 162, 213, 224, 232, 233, 234, 271, 286, and 288 were allowed to be any amino acid during the Rosetta design with other sidechains held in a fixed position and the backbone fixed. The designed residues were in direct contact with the olivetolate and not in direct contact with GST. The fixed backbone script main/source/bin/fixbb.static.linuxgccrelease from the Rosetta 3.7 release was run with the all possible rotamers (\u2212ex4), using the input sidechains (\u2212use_input_sc), sidechains minimized after design (minimize_sidechains), the linear memnode interaction graph (\u2212linmem_ig 10), and both with and without the ligand weighted score function (\u2212score:weights ligand). From the identical starting point each design was run 5 times using the \u2212nstruct input. From the set of mutations suggested by Rosetta, the mutations that occurred most frequently and contributed most to the Rosetta score function were chosen, creating a library of 22 mutants for experimental testing.",
