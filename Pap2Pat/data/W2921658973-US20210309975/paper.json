    "abstract": "Prenylation of natural compounds adds structural diversity, alters biological activity, and enhances therapeutic potential. Because prenylated compounds often have a low natural abundance, alternative production methods are needed. Metabolic engineering enables natural product biosynthesis from inexpensive biomass, but is limited by the complexity of secondary metabolite pathways, intermediate and product toxicities, and substrate accessibility. Alternatively, enzyme catalyzed prenyl transfer provides excellent regio- and stereo-specificity, but requires expensive isoprenyl pyrophosphate substrates. Here we develop a flexible cell-free enzymatic prenylating system that generates isoprenyl pyrophosphate substrates from glucose to prenylate an array of natural products. The system provides an efficient route to cannabinoid precursors cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) at >1 g/L, and a single enzymatic step converts the precursors into cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA). Cell-free methods may provide a powerful alternative to metabolic engineering for chemicals that are hard to produce in living organisms.",

                "Prenylated natural products are a large class of bioactive molecules with demonstrated medicinal properties1. Examples include prenyl-flavanoids, prenyl-stilbenoids, and cannabinoids (see Fig.\u00a01). Cannabinoids in particular show immense therapeutic potential with over 100 ongoing clinical trials as antiemetics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and analgesics2\u20136. Nevertheless, despite the therapeutic potential of prenyl-natural products, their study and use is limited by the lack of cost-effective production methods. Plant-derived prenyl-compounds are difficult to isolate due to the structural similarity of contaminating molecules, and the variable composition between crops7,8. These challenges are further exacerbated when attempting to isolate low abundance compounds. Many chemical syntheses have been developed to address the challenges associated with making prenylated natural products, but they are generally impractical for drug manufacturing due to the degree of complexity and low yields9\u201311.Fig. 1The synthetic biochemistry platform for the production of prenyl-natural products. First, glucose is broken down into pyruvate through a glycolysis pathway modified to regulate NADPH levels (22) (12 enzymatic steps). Then, either PDH or the PDH bypass converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is converted into GPP via the mevalonate pathway (eight enzymatic steps). By varying the aromatic prenyltransferase (aPT) and aromatic substrate we are able to produce various prenyl-flavonoids and prenyl-stilbenoids using the same central pathway. We developed variants of the prenyltransferase NphB (dNphB) to produce CBGA or CBGVA. CBGA is converted to cannabidiol and CBGVA is converted to cannabidivaric acid via cannabidiolic acid synthase (CBDAS). It is possible to produce other cannabinoids by using different cannabinoid synthases (THCAS and CBCAS)",
                "Microbial production is a useful alternative to natural extraction for prenylated natural products, but comes with many challenges such as the need to divert carbon flux from central metabolism and product toxicity to name a few. For example, prenyl-natural products like prenyl-naringenin, prenyl-resveratrol, and cannabidiol (CBD) are derived from a combination of the metabolic pathways for fatty acid, isoprenoid, and polyketide biosynthesis. So, high-level production requires efficient re-routing of long, essential and highly regulated pathways. Despite the challenges, many groups have engineered microbes to produce unprenylated polyketides, like naringenin, resveratrol, and olivetolate, but at relatively low levels (110, 391, and 80\u2009mg/L, respectively)12,13. Obtaining prenylated products is even more challenging because geranyl-pyrophosphate (GPP) is an essential metabolite that is toxic to cells at moderate concentrations, creating a significant barrier for high-level microbial production14. So, in spite of intense interest, to our knowledge there are no published reports of the complete biosynthesis of prenyl-flavonoids, prenyl-stilbenoids, or cannabinoids in recombinant microbes.",
                "Much recent effort has focused on alternative methods for cannabinoid production. Two groups have produced the polyketide cannabinoid intermediate, olivetolic acid (OA) at low levels in yeast (0.5\u2009mg/L) or E. coli (80\u2009mg/L), but did not prenylate OA or produce a cannabinoid from the biosynthesized OA13,15. In other work, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid was produced in cell extracts from either exogenously added GPP and OA in a two enzyme pathway16 or from cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) using a single enzyme17. However, it is unclear how GPP or CBGA could be obtained at sufficient levels for economical production due to the high cost of these molecules.",
                "Here, we propose an alternative biological approach to prenylated natural product biosynthesis using a cell-free enzymatic platform we call synthetic biochemistry, which has shown great promise for the production of bio-based molecules18\u201324. The synthetic biochemistry approach frees us from worrying about the toxicity of products and intermediates, affords rapid design-build-test cycles, precise control of all system components, and complete flexibility in pathway design. Nevertheless, building highly complex systems involving dozens of enzymes, associated cofactors and myriad metabolites on a large scale outside the context of the cell is an enormous challenge. One of the keys to making commercially viable cell-free systems is reducing enzyme costs by employing stable enzymes that can last for long periods of time. Recently, Zhang and co-workers converted maltodextrin into inositol at a 20,000\u2009L scale in a five enzyme system using thermophilic enzymes purified by simple heating step25, demonstrating that at least simple cell-free systems can reach industrial scale. Another key requirement is designing systems that effectively generate and recycle high energy cofactors (ATP, NAD(P)H) so that they can be used many times. We have previously reported a flexible enzymatic purge valve and rheostat for regulating the supply of reducing equivalents and ATP26\u201328, allowing us to build systems that run for many days and produce high titers of isobutanol and terpenes. Here, we employ these concepts to develop cell-free production of a variety of prenylated compounds. We use glucose as a feedstock to produce GPP and optimize the system for the high-titer production of the cannabinoid compounds CBGA and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA)."

                        "Our synthetic biochemistry approach is outlined in Fig.\u00a01 (detailed in Supplementary Figure\u00a01) and expands on a system we developed previously for terpene production26. First, glucose is broken down via a modified glycolysis pathway to produce high-energy cofactors ATP and NADPH in addition to the carbon building block, acetyl-CoA using an alternative pyruvate oxidation pathway26. The acetyl-CoA is then assembled into the prenyl-donor compound, GPP, via the mevalonate pathway using the ATP and NADPH produced from glycolysis. Importantly, a purge valve26 introduced into the glycolysis pathway balances NADPH production and consumption while maintaining carbon flux. The prenylation module then uses the GPP to prenylate exogenously added substrate to yield the desired prenylated product. To expand the capabilities of our synthetic biochemistry platform we developed a prenylating system that employs a nonspecific prenylating enzyme such as NphB, AtaPT, or NovQ to produce an array of prenyl-compounds derived from glucose29\u201331. We then further engineered NphB using Rosetta to specifically prenylate OA.",
                        "As a first test of the system, we built the full cell-free system (23 enzymes) to generate GPP from glucose and employed wild-type NphB to prenylate its preferred substrate 1,6 dihydroxynapthalene (1,6 DHN; added exogenously). 1,6 DHN was added at the beginning of the reaction along with glucose. Up to ~400\u2009mg/L (1.3\u2009mM) of prenylated product was obtained from 2.5\u2009mM 1,6 DHN. However, increasing the 1,6 DHN concentration from 2.5 to 5\u2009mM, decreased final titers ~2-fold suggesting that 1,6 DHN inhibited one or more enzymes (Fig.\u00a02a). Enzyme assays revealed that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was inhibited by 1,6 DHN, as well as olivetol, resveratrol, and olivetolate (Fig.\u00a02b). Therefore, to engineer a general prenylation system, we sought to eliminate PDH.Fig. 2Development of a PDH bypass for the prenylation of aromatic polyketides. a The comparison of the final titers achieved with the full pathway utilizing PDH (PDH system-gray trace) and the PDH bypass system (blue trace) at different concentrations of 1,6 DHN.

The result is a variety of C5 and C10 prenyl-natural products. (* Indicates titer not determined). d Production of 5-prenyl-1,6 DHN (blue trace) over time compared to a separate reaction to produce CBGA (green trace). Both reactions utilized the PDH bypass and WT NphB (biological replicates, n\u2009=\u20093). All error ranges reflect the standard deviation. Source data for Fig.\u00a02a\u2013d are provided as a\u00a0Source Data file",
                        "To remove the need for PDH, we implemented a PDH bypass (Fig.\u00a01). In the PDH bypass, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA using a pyruvate oxidase (PyOx) to produce acetyl-phosphate followed by the action of acetyl-phosphate transferase (PTA). The PDH bypass\u00a0has two advantages. First, PDH is a large enzyme complex that is difficult to work with, so bypassing PDH streamlines enzyme production. More importantly, initial experiments revealed that the bypass is not subject to the inhibition seen at higher concentrations of 1,6 DHN. Once we confirmed the PDH bypass improved 1,6 DHN titers, we began to optimize the system as a general prenylation system. We varied co-factor concentrations, protein levels, and environmental conditions such as temperature and pH to identify the ideal set of conditions. Throughout this process we found that ATP, NADP+, phosphate, and NphB concentrations had the greatest impact on the final titer. As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, when we employed the PDH bypass, we found a 4-fold increase in titers of 5-prenyl-1,6 DHN when starting with 5\u2009mM 1,6 DHN (Fig.\u00a02a). When utilizing the PDH bypass system, approximately 50% of 1,6 DHN was converted in 24\u2009h, reaching a final titer of 705\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009mg/L (all error ranges in this work reflect the standard deviation) (Fig.\u00a02b).",
                        "We then tested the ability of the PDH bypass cell-free system to prenylate a variety of aromatic substrates (apigenin, diadzein, genestein, naringenin, olivetol, OA, and resveratrol). All the aromatic substrates were prenylated using one or more of the tested prenyl transferases (Fig.\u00a02c and Supplementary Figures\u00a05\u201310). Thus, it is possible to produce a variety of prenylated natural products using a cell-free enzymatic system to generate the expensive co-substrates GPP and DMAPP. Further, the ease with which an exogenous substrate can be added to a synthetic biochemistry system is a great advantage because it is often not possible to add co-substrates exogenously to microbes since they cannot enter the cell16.",
                        "To test whether we could use synthetic biochemistry to produce high levels of therapeutically relevant prenylated products, we focused optimization efforts on cannabinoids due to the growing interest in new ways to make these medically important compounds. As shown in Fig.\u00a02d the initial system produced the cannabinoid precursor CBGA at a constant rate of 2.1\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121 over 72\u2009h and reached a final titer of only 132\u2009mg/L (Fig.\u00a02d)."

                        "Although the system produced CBGA, there were two problems. First, the turnover rate of the prenyltransferase NphB for CBGA production is extremely poor (kcat\u2009=\u20090.0021\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00008\u2009min\u22121, Supplementary Table\u00a05). Second, prenylation of OA by NphB is highly nonspecific, generating a major side-product, 2-O-geranyl olivetolate16. We therefore, sought to improve CBGA production by enhancing the activity and specificity of NphB by design.",
                        "Briefly, OA was docked into the active site of the NphB crystal structure (Fig.\u00a03a)32, then Rosetta was used to predict mutations that would improve OA binding. We narrowed the Rosetta results to a 22 construct library (see Supplementary Tables\u00a02 and 3), and screened for CBGA production (Supplementary Table\u00a04). We made several key observations during the initial screen, shown in Supplementary Figure\u00a02: (1) Y288A (M1) and Y288N (M2) by themselves dramatically enhanced activity, as predicted by computation; (2) the presence of Y288N in any construct decreased the enzyme yield suggesting Y288N may be a destabilizing mutation (making Y288A the preferred mutation); (3) the addition of G286S in the Y288N (M10) background appeared to improve activity further over Y288N (M2), suggesting that G286S could be another favorable mutation; (4) we noted an activity improvement of Y288A/F213N/A232S (M15) over Y288A/F213N (M5) suggesting that A232S may also be a favorable mutation. From these initial observations we constructed a focused library with all but one of the constructs in the second library exhibiting activity at least 100-fold higher than WT NphB in an endpoint assay (Fig.\u00a03b).Fig. 3Engineering NphB to improve CBGA production. a A model of olivetolate in the active site of WT NphB (1ZB6).

Both had kcat values 1000-fold higher than WT NphB and both produce only the correct prenylated isomer, CBGA. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c, WT NphB produces CBGA, but the dominant product is a prenylated side-product, 2-O-geranyl olivetolate, whereas M23 makes CBGA almost exclusively. Overall, the designed enzyme is a much more active and specific CBGA synthase than WT NphB, and is easier to work with than the natural cannabis prenyltransferase, which is an integral membrane protein16,33. Our soluble, CBGA synthase (M23) could potentially be applied in both cell-free and in vivo systems to improve cannabinoid production."

                        "With our designed CBGA synthase in hand (M23), we tested the ability to produce CBGA directly from glucose and OA using the full synthetic biochemistry system, including the PDH bypass (Fig.\u00a01). The initial productivity of the system using M23 was 67\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121 with a final titer of 744\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009mg/L CBGA\u2014100-fold faster and 21-fold higher titer than CBGA production using WT NphB (Fig.\u00a04a). We noted that with the mutant NphB enzyme, maximum titers were reached within 24\u2009h, after which production spontaneously stopped. In contrast, the system with the wild-type enzyme ran continuously for up to 4 days, suggesting enzymes and cofactors remain active and viable for longer periods of time, consistent with prior work26. So what is stopping the reaction at the higher titers? We observed that reactions turned cloudy once ~500\u2009mg/L CBGA was produced. We collected the precipitate and identified a mix of enzymes in the precipitate by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis (Supplementary Figure\u00a03), indicating high-levels of CBGA in solution may be causing enzymes to precipitate. We, therefore, sought to continually remove the product in situ during the reaction (a capability difficult to implement in living systems).Fig. 4Evaluation of the cell-free prenylation system for the production of various cannabinoids. a The cell-free enzymatic production (from glucose) of cannabinoid precursors over time. CBGA production using M23 is shown in the dark aqua trace and WT NphB in the light green trace. The production of CBGVA using M31 is shown in the dark blue trace. The concentration of WT, M23, and M31 NphB was fixed at 0.5\u2009mg/mL (biological replicates, n\u2009=\u20093). b Using a nonane-flow CBGA capture system, we were able to obtain a higher titer of CBGA (1.2\u2009g/L). The nonane layer was exchanged using a peristaltic pump, which circulated the nonane in the direction indicated by the arrows. c Production of CBDA over time using CBDAS (biological replicates, n\u2009=\u20093).

                        "Initially a fixed volume nonane overlay was used for each reaction to extract CBGA. Unfortunately, CBGA is more soluble in water than nonane, limiting the amount of CBGA that can be extracted with a simple overlay. We therefore designed a flow system that would capture CBGA from the nonane layer and trap it in a separate buffered reservoir (Fig.\u00a04b). By implementing this flow system we hoped to maintain a lower concentration of CBGA in the reaction vessel to mitigate enzyme precipitation. The flow system indeed improved the final titers to 1.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07\u2009g/L, however, enzyme precipitation still occurred at about 24\u2009h.",
                        "We next evaluated the system flexibility by replacing OA with divarinic acid (DA) to produce the precursor of many rare cannabinoids, CBGVA. We first tested whether our designed enzymes would be active with DA as the substrate. Kinetic analysis (Table\u00a0S5) indicated that M31 effectively prenylates DA, with catalytic efficiencies 15-fold higher than M23 and 650-fold higher than WT NphB. We, therefore, utilized M31 to produce CBGVA from glucose and DA. As shown in Fig.\u00a04a, CBGVA was produced at a maximum productivity of ~107\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121, and reached a final titer of 1.74\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09\u2009g/L, converting 92% of the added DA to CBGVA. The nonane-flow system was not needed for the production of CBGVA because CBGVA was less potent in precipitating enzymes."

Conversion of CBGA into CBDA has been demonstrated by several groups17,34\u201336. In our case, we simply transferred the nonane overlay containing CBGA to an aqueous solution containing CBDA synthase, and indeed we were able to convert CBGA into CBDA at a constant rate of 14.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121\u2009mg total protein\u22121 over the course of 4 days converting 25% of the CBGA added to CBDA (Fig.\u00a04c). To our knowledge it is not known whether CBGVA can be converted into the rare cannabinoid CBDVA using the CBDA synthase. So we added CBGVA, extracted from the cell-free system, to a reaction containing CBDA synthase. CBDVA was produced (Supplementary Figure\u00a04) by CBDA synthase at a rate of 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009mg\u2009L\u22121\u2009h\u22121\u2009mg total protein\u22121 for 24\u2009h.

                "Our results demonstrate the power and flexibility of a cell-free approach, not only for the production of pure, therapeutically relevant cannabinoids and other prenylated natural products, but for bio-derived chemicals in general. Freedom from worries about cell viability allowed us to focus on pathway optimization rather than minimizing GPP toxicity, while the lack of a cell membrane barrier freed us to design a system with added aromatic molecules, which would not be possible in cells. Moreover, we could flexibly change the input from OA to DA to target rare cannabinoids without redesigning an entire pathway. Finally, it was straightforward to identify and focus our efforts on fixing the bottleneck steps. When we started this project we were only able to produce 9\u2009mg/L of CBGA using the monoterpene pathway developed by Korman et al.26. By introducing the PDH bypass and optimizing for cofactors, enzymes and environmental factors we were able to increase those titers to 132\u2009mg/L. To improve titers further we engineered the NphB prenyltransferase, which further increased titers to 600\u2009mg/L of CBGA. The final bottleneck was enzyme stability in the presence of CBGA, so by limiting the CBGA in the reaction vessel, we increased the titer to 1.25\u2009g/L of CBGA, nearly a 140-fold improvement. Solutions were quickly implemented due to speedy design-build-test cycles, rapidly yielding results that far exceed published results using living cells. Like all new technology, the current system will need additional technical developments to become commercially viable, but our results suggest that synthetic biochemistry can become a realistic option for producing bio-based chemicals."

Shoyoma et al.37 published the chemical shifts of CBGVA in CD3OD, so by direct comparison of our NMR spectra to the published chemical shifts we conclude that we produced CBGVA.

A 500\u2009\u00b5L nonane overlay was added to the reaction in a 2\u2009ml glass vial which was covered with 2 layers of breathable cell culture film. Two 18-gauge needles were inserted into a 15\u2009mL falcon tube at the ~750\u2009\u00b5L mark and the 3.5\u2009mL mark. Luer locks to tubing connectors were connected to the needles and Viton tubing was connected to the other end of the luer lock. Eighteen-gauge needles were connected to the other end of the tubing via a luer lock connector and inserted through the mesh covering so they were only touching the nonane layer and not the reaction. In total, 2\u2009mL of Tris buffer [pH 8.5] was added to the 15\u2009mL conical tube, and 6\u2009mL of nonane was added. The nonane was pumped through the system using a peristaltic pump (~1\u2009mL/min) such that the nonane flowed from the top of the reaction, through the buffered solution (~18\u2009cm tubing). The nonane pumped into the reservoir separated into the top layer of the 15\u2009mL conical tube. The nonane from the top of the 15\u2009mL conical tube was pumped into the top of the reaction vial (~55\u2009cm tubing). This essentially diluted the CBGA throughout the system driving the diffusion of CBGA into the nonane layer and out of the reaction."
