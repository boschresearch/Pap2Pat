    "abstract": "Epigenetic \u201cclocks\u201d can now surpass chronological age in accuracy for estimating biological age. Here, we use four such age estimators to show that epigenetic aging can be reversed in humans. Using a protocol intended to regenerate the thymus, we observed protective immunological changes, improved risk indices for many age\u2010related diseases, and a mean epigenetic age approximately 1.5 years less than baseline after 1 year of treatment (\u22122.5\u2010year change compared to no treatment at the end of the study). The rate of epigenetic aging reversal relative to chronological age accelerated from \u22121.6 year/year from 0\u20139 month to \u22126.5 year/year from 9\u201312 month. The GrimAge predictor of human morbidity and mortality showed a 2\u2010year decrease in epigenetic vs. chronological age that persisted six months after discontinuing treatment. This is to our knowledge the first report of an increase, based on an epigenetic age estimator, in predicted human lifespan by means of a currently accessible aging intervention.",

                "Population aging is an increasingly important problem in developed countries, bringing with it a host of medical, social, economic, political, and psychological problems (Rae et al., 2010). Over the last several years, many biomedical approaches to ameliorating aging have been investigated in animal models, and some of these seem able to reverse general aspects of aging in adult mammals based on a variety of physiological measurements (Das et al., 2018; Ocampo et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). However, to date, evidence that systemic aging can be reversed has not been substantiated by determinations of epigenetic age, which can now provide a simple but compelling indication of biological as opposed to chronological age (Horvath & Raj, 2018; Jylhava, Pedersen, & Hagg, 2017). In addition, there is a need to specifically address immunosenescence stemming from thymic involution (Bodey, Bodey, Siegel, & Kaiser, 1997). Thymic involution leads to the depletion of critical immune cell populations (Arnold, Wolf, Brunner, Herndler\u2010Brandstetter, & Grubeck\u2010Loebenstein, 2011), resulting in a collapse of the T\u2010cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in humans after the age of ~63 (Naylor et al., 2005), and is linked to age\u2010related increases in cancer incidence (Falci et al., 2013), infectious disease (Ventevogel & Sempowski, 2013), autoimmune conditions (Goronzy & Weyand, 2003), generalized inflammation (Goronzy & Weyand, 2003), atherosclerosis (Dai, Zhang, Wang, Wu, & Liang, 2018), and all\u2010cause mortality (Fernando\u2010Martinez et al., 2013; Roberts\u2010Thomson, Whittingham, Youngschaiyud, & Mackay, 1974; Strindhall et al., 2007). In contrast, maintained immune function is seen in centenarians (Strindhall et al., 2007). Although thymic function in aging also depends on the supply of T\u2010cell progenitors from the bone marrow, which declines in relation to the output of myeloid HSCs with age (Akunuru & Geiger, 2016), the net number of lymphoid precursors does not change with age (Montecino\u2010Rodriguez et al., 2019), and migration of T\u2010cell precursors from the bone marrow also appears to depend on thymic function (Haar, Taubenberger, Doane, & Kenyon, 1989).",
                "For these reasons, we conducted what may be the first human clinical trial designed to reverse aspects of human aging, the TRIIM (Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration, and Insulin Mitigation) trial, in 2015\u20132017. The purpose of the TRIIM trial was to investigate the possibility of using recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) to prevent or reverse signs of immunosenescence in a population of 51\u2010 to 65\u2010year\u2010old putatively healthy men, which represents the age range that just precedes the collapse of the TCR repertoire. rhGH was used based on prior evidence that growth hormone (GH) has thymotrophic and immune reconstituting effects in animals (Kelley et al., 1986) and human HIV patients (Napolitano et al., 2008; Plana et al., 2011). Because GH\u2010induced hyperinsulinemia (Marcus et al., 1990) is undesirable and might affect thymic regeneration and immunological reconstitution, we combined rhGH with both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and metformin in an attempt to limit the \u201cdiabetogenic\u201d effect of GH (Fahy, 2003, 2010; Weiss, Villareal, Fontana, Han, & Holloszy, 2011). DHEA has many effects, in both men and women, that oppose deleterious effects of normal aging (Cappola et al., 2009; Forti et al., 2012; Shufelt et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2011). Metformin is a powerful calorie restriction mimetic in aging mice (Dhahbi, Mote, Fahy, & Spindler, 2005) and has been proposed as a candidate for slowing aging in humans (Barzilai, Crandall, Kritchevsky, & Espeland, 2016). Neither DHEA (Riley, Fitzmaurice, & Regelson, 1990) nor metformin are known to have any thymotrophic effects of their own."

Both of these changes should be detectable by measuring PSA or percent free PSA levels. However, PSA, percent free PSA, and the ratio of PSA to percent free PSA, an overall index of prostate cancer risk, improved significantly by day 15 of treatment and remained favorably altered to the end of 12\u00a0months (Figure 1a\u2013c). A brief spike in PSA at 6\u00a0months in two volunteers was rapidly reversed and, after volunteer consultation, was interpreted as reflecting sexual activity close to the time of PSA testing. No change in testosterone levels was observed.",
                        "Another significant concern was whether augmenting immune activity might exacerbate age\u2010related inflammation. However, CRP declined with treatment, the decline reaching statistical significance by 9\u201312\u00a0months (Figure 1d). The pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine, IL\u20106, did not change (Figure 1e).",
                        "No remarkable changes were noted in serum albumin, lipids, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, electrolytes, and hepatic enzymes (Figure 1f). Insulin levels were in general adequately controlled by co\u2010administration of DHEA and metformin (Figure 1g) (although one outlier increased mean insulin at 12\u00a0months), and glucose levels did not change (Figure 1h). Finally, estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), which are relevant to the potential for lactic acidosis with metformin as well as to treatment efficacy, showed a statistically significant improvement after 9\u201312\u00a0months (with a trend toward improvement at 18\u00a0months as well) (Figure 1i). Side effects were mild, typical of rhGH administration, and did not require dosing modification except in two cases. Side effects included arthralgias (2 cases), anxiety (1 case), carpal tunnel syndrome (1 case), fluid retention (1 case), mild gynecomastia (1 case), and muscle soreness (1 case). One trial volunteer was removed from the study after approximately one month due to self\u2010reported bradycardia, which preceded the trial, and belated admission of a strong familial history of cancer."

                        "Obvious qualitative improvements in thymic MRI density were observed and are illustrated in Figure 2. Quantitatively, the overall increase in the thymic fat\u2010free fraction (TFFF) was significant at the p\u00a0=\u00a08.57\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221217 level based on linear mixed\u2010model analysis, implying a restoration of thymic functional mass. The improvements were significant in 7 of 9 volunteers (Figure 3a\u2013c). Two volunteers had abnormally low levels of thymic fat (high TFFF) at baseline, and their TFFFs did not significantly improve with treatment (peak relative changes of +9.6% (p\u00a0>\u00a0.3) and +12.4% (p\u00a0>\u00a0.2); Figure 3b). Their lack of response was not age\u2010dependent. Instead, improvement in TFFF was dependent upon baseline TFFF, regardless of baseline age (Figure 3c).",
                        "By comparison, sternal BMFFF increased to a much lesser degree, but with such consistency (Figure 3d) as to reach high statistical significance (Figure 3e; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for single\u2010point comparison, or p\u00a0=\u00a09.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221212 for formal linear mixed\u2010model analysis). Bone marrow, similar to thymus, showed a pattern of increased BMFFF with increased baseline fat content, but the details of the pattern were different (Figure 3f). This difference plus the more robust replacement of thymic vs. bone marrow fat is consistent both with a specific reversal of thymic involution rather than generalized regression of body fat owing to GH administration and with possible stimulation of bone marrow T\u2010cell progenitor production by GH (French et al., 2002; Hanley, Napolitano, & McCune, 2005)."

Linear mixed\u2010model correlation analysis also showed a significant correlation after 9 and 12\u00a0months of treatment between TFFF and the reduction in CD38+ monocyte percentage (r 2\u00a0=\u00a0.59, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) as well as a correlation between TFFF and the ratio of lymphocytes to CD38+ monocytes (r 2\u00a0=\u00a0.55, p\u00a0=\u00a0.018). Similar trends were seen for total monocytes vs. TFFF and for the overall LMR vs. TFFF (respectively, r 2\u00a0=\u00a0.40, p\u00a0=\u00a0.039, and r 2\u00a0=\u00a0.45, p\u00a0=\u00a0.019) when correlated across all treatment times (0, 9, and 12\u00a0months).

                        "Although, on average, trial volunteer epigenetic ages (EAs) were lower than their chronological ages (As) at baseline [(EA\u2010A)0\u00a0<\u00a00, Table 1], epigenetic age was nevertheless significantly decreased by treatment based on the results of all four epigenetic clocks (Figure 5a\u2013d), with a mean change in EA\u2010A after 12\u00a0months of about 2.5\u00a0years (Figure 5e). The effect of treatment on epigenetic age regression at 12\u00a0months was not dependent on age at onset of treatment or on (EA\u2010A)0 (Table 1). Linear mixed\u2010model analysis (LMMA) showed significance levels for individual clocks ranging from p\u00a0=\u00a0.0009\u2013.012 over months 0\u201312 to p\u00a0=\u00a0.0016\u2013.028 for months 0\u201318 (Figure 5 legend). Horvath clock LMMA results were unchanged (p\u00a0=\u00a0.018) after adjusting for changes in blood cell composition (lymphocyte count, percent of senescent CD8 T cells among CD8 T cells, and the LMR). Although there was a general tendency for EA\u2010A to trend back toward (EA\u2010A)0 6\u00a0months after discontinuation of treatment, this trend was incomplete, leaving on average an improvement of more than 1.5\u00a0years at trial month 18 (Figure 5e, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, the GrimAge clock, which is specifically able to predict human life expectancy (Lu et al., 2019), showed no regression of (EA\u2010A)\u2010(EA\u2010A)0 after treatment, with a gain of approximately 2.1\u00a0years at 12\u00a0months still remaining at trial month 18 (Figure 5d; Table 1). Furthermore, comparing the rates of aging regression between 0\u20139 and 9\u201312\u00a0months showed that, for every age estimator, the rate of aging regression appeared to accelerate substantially with increasing treatment time (Figure 5a\u2013d and Table 1), with a mean slope over all four clocks of \u22121.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0years/year in the first 9\u00a0months to \u22126.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0years/year in the last 3\u00a0months of treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a0.005, Figure 5f)."

                "The TRIIM trial was designed to investigate the possibility of thymus regeneration and reversion of immunosenescent trends in healthy aging men while minimizing side effects and any possible risks. Our results support the feasibility of this goal but unexpectedly also bring to light robust evidence that regression of multiple aspects and biomarkers of aging is possible in man. These two observations may be related.",
                "Thymus regeneration and reactivation by growth hormone administration have been established in aging rats and dogs by restoration of youthful thymic histology (Goff, Roth, Arp, & al., e., 1987; Kelley et al., 1986) and by reversal of age\u2010related immune deficits (Kelley et al., 1986). In humans, the existence of surviving thymic tissue after the age of about 54, which is required for successful thymus regeneration in older individuals, has been questioned (Simanovsky, Hiller, Loubashevsky, & Rozovsky, 2012). Available reports indicating increased thymic CT density and immunological improvements induced by rhGH in HIV patients (Napolitano et al., 2008; Plana et al., 2011), whose thymi are physiologically unusual (McCune et al., 1998), are silent on whether regeneration was observed in individuals over the age of 50. The present study now establishes highly significant evidence of thymic regeneration in normal aging men accompanied by improvements in a variety of disease risk factors and age\u2010related immunological parameters as well as significant correlations between TFFF and favorable changes in monocyte percentages and the LMR, independent of age up to the age of 65 at the onset of treatment. These observations are consistent with the known ability of growth hormone to stimulate hematopoiesis and thymic epithelial cell proliferation (Savino, 2007). Our finding of an increase in FGF\u201021 levels after 12\u00a0months of treatment suggests that thymic regeneration by the present treatment may be mediated in part by this cytokine (Youm, Horvath, Mangelsdorf, Kliewer, & Dixit, 2016), which we believe is a novel finding.",
                "We have not found previous studies associating rhGH administration with an increased LMR or reduced monocyte levels, whereas DHEA administration may actually increase monocyte levels (Khorram, Vu, & Yen, 1997). The mechanisms involved are not clear, but the unexpected effect of our treatment on the LMR may be of considerable significance, for two reasons.",
                "First, higher LMRs are associated with better prognoses for a variety of leading sources of human mortality, including at least 8 types of cancer (e.g., prostate cancer; Caglayan et al., 2019), atherosclerosis (Gong et al., 2018), cardiovascular disease (Ji et al., 2017), and stroke (Ren, Liu, Wang, & Gao, 2017)], and are also associated with less generalized inflammation (Gong et al., 2018). Protection from cardiovascular disease has been associated with an LMR above 5 (Gong et al., 2018). In our study, mean volunteer LMRs were below 5 at baseline but were well above 5 at the end of treatment and 6\u00a0months after the end of treatment.",
                "Second, the great majority of monocytes are CD38\u2010positive. CD38 is an NADase ectoenzyme and a degrader of the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and increased CD38 expression with age appears to be the primary cause of age\u2010related tissue NAD+ depletion in mice and most likely in man as well (Camacho\u2010Pereira et al., 2016). Induction of CD38 with aging has been proposed to be driven by age\u2010related inflammation, and to originate in inflammatory cells residing in tissues (Camacho\u2010Pereira et al., 2016), which in principle might include monocytes. Although many other immune cells express CD38, we did not detect any other CD38+ immune cell population that declined in response to thymus regeneration treatment, suggesting that monocytes may be of particular significance. Our observation of a decline in CRP in combination with reduced monocyte levels therefore suggests the possibility of an increase in tissue NAD+ levels. The mechanism by which CRP was reduced is not clear, but reactivation of negative selection in the thymus could in theory reduce autoimmune\u2010related inflammation; clearance of pro\u2010inflammatory viruses or senescent somatic cells could also be involved. Given the relationship between age\u2010related tissue NAD+ depletion and the onset of aging phenotypes (Das et al., 2018; Poljsak & Milisav, 2016), an increased tissue NAD+ content could be connected to our observations of reversed epigenetic aging, to the general association of higher LMRs with better health, and to previous observations linking thymus transplantation to regression of various nonimmunological aging processes (Fabris, Mocchegiani, Muzzioli, & Provinciali, 1988). Consistent with this possibility, we observed that strong declines in total and CD38+ monocytes, increases in LMR, and reduced GrimAge all persisted for 6\u00a0months following discontinuation of treatment.",
                "Treatment\u2010induced declines in PD\u20101+ CD8 T cells are consistent with the possibility that thymus regeneration treatment epigenetically reprograms \u201cexhausted\u201d CD8 T cells (T EX), a recently characterized distinct PD\u20101+ CD8 population (Khan et al., 2019). These cells are of great interest in part because PD\u20101 is an immune checkpoint molecule that inhibits T\u2010cell proliferative responses (Henson, Macaulay, Franzese, & Akbar, 2012) and is involved in cancer evasion of immune control, leading to intensive efforts to develop pharmacological immune checkpoint inhibitors that target PD\u20101 (Khan et al., 2019). Blocking PD\u20101 signaling improves proliferation of \u201csenescent\u201d human CD\u20108 cells (Henson, Macaulay, Riddell, Nunn, & Akbar, 2015). Mice, too, develop a subpopulation of exhausted CD8 cells with aging that are PD\u20101+ and Tim\u20103+ (Lee et al., 2016). Therefore, reduction of PD\u20101+ CD8 T cells with thymus regeneration treatment likely represents a significant improvement in immune status.",
                "Treatment\u2010induced increases in na\u00efve CD4 and na\u00efve CD8 T cells were relatively small compared to changes reported in rhGH\u2010treated HIV patients, but our volunteer population was pre\u2010immunosenescent and not depleted of na\u00efve CD4 and na\u00efve CD8 T cells at baseline. Positive responses also occurred despite potential complications caused by lymph node aging (Thompson et al., 2019). Therefore, the small increases observed in these cells and in CD4 T\u2010cell RTEs are consistent with the ultimate goal of preventing or reversing the normal age\u2010related collapse of the TCR repertoire at ages just above those of our study population (Naylor et al., 2005).",
                "There may be both immunological and non\u2010immunological mechanisms of epigenetic aging reversal. GH, DHEA, and metformin have unique effects that are in opposition to aging, and it is possible that the specific combination of these agents activates a broad enough range of therapeutic pathways to account for the previously unpredictable reversal of epigenetic aging, even independently of the immunological markers we have measured.",
                "In this regard, it must be pointed out that GH and IGF\u20101 can also have pro\u2010aging effects and that most gerontologists therefore favor reducing rather than increasing the levels of these factors (Longo et al., 2015). However, most past studies of aging and GH/IGF\u20101 are confounded by the use of mutations that affect the developmental programming of aging, which is not necessarily relevant to nonmutant adults. For example, such mutations in mice alter the normal innervation of the hypothalamus during brain development and prevent\u00a0the hypothalamic inflammation in the adult (Sadagurski et al., 2015). Hypothalamic inflammation may program adult body\u2010wide aging in nonmutants (Zhang et al., 2017), but it seems unlikely that lowering IGF\u20101 in normal non\u2010mutant adults can provide the same protection. A second problem with past studies is a general failure to uncouple GH/IGF\u20101 signaling from lifelong changes in insulin signaling. Human longevity seems more consistently linked to insulin sensitivity than to IGF\u20101 levels, and the effects of IGF\u20101 on human longevity are confounded by its inverse proportionality to insulin sensitivity (Vitale, Pellegrino, Vollery, & Hofland, 2019). We therefore believe our approach of increasing GH/IGF\u20101 for a limited time in the more natural context of elevated DHEA while maximizing insulin sensitivity is justified, particularly in view of the positive role of GH and IGF\u20101 in immune maintenance, the role of immune maintenance in the retardation of aging (Fabris et al., 1988), and our present results.",
                "Whatever the mechanism of epigenetic age reversal may be, the four selected epigenetic clocks, despite measuring somewhat different features of aging and correlating differently with blood composition and leukocyte telomere length, all showed significant regression of epigenetic age. There was also a marked acceleration of epigenetic aging reversal after 9\u00a0months of treatment. The implications of the latter observation remain to be explored. Further, although epigenetic aging reversal appeared to partially regress following discontinuation of treatment according to some epigenetic clocks, this was not true for the GrimAge clock, which best predicts human life expectancy and health span (Lu et al., 2019). It remains to be seen whether follow\u2010up measurements of epigenetic aging using the GrimAge clock will show a persistent 2\u2010year gain in predicted life expectancy or a gradual loss of increased life expectancy compared to baseline. In the latter event, it will be interesting to determine whether repetition or prolongation of the trial treatment might restore or further augment the predicted lifespan gain.",
                "Although epigenetic age does not measure all features of aging and is not synonymous with aging itself, it is the most accurate measure of biological age and age\u2010related disease risk available today. This justifies the use of epigenetic clocks to estimate the effectiveness of putative aging interventions on a practical timescale. The present study strongly supports this approach, having demonstrated regression of epigenetic age with high statistical significance even in a one\u2010year pilot trial involving only 9 volunteers. However, it will be necessary to verify the present results by replicating them in an appropriately powered follow\u2010up study. Although much more remains to be done, the general prospects for meaningful amelioration of human aging appear to be remarkably promising."

There were two cohorts, the first consisting of seven men and the second comprising three men. Cohort 1 was treated from October of 2015 to October of 2016, and cohort 2 was treated from April 2016 to April 2017. Volunteers first completed an online screening questionnaire, and qualifying candidates then provided a blood sample for objective confirmation of health eligibility. Candidates passing the second screen attended a meeting to enable physical evaluation, verification of ability to self\u2010inject rhGH, baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the thymus, two additional blood collections (see Appendix S2), informed consent, and instruction on how to fill out provided medication diaries intended to remind volunteers of dosing schedules and to report any adverse effects or any irregularities in dosing."

Volunteers received MRI examinations at the Lucas Center for Imaging, blood collections at the Stanford Blood Center, and CyTOF analysis by the Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC) under the approval of the Stanford University Research Compliance Office. The trial was conducted consistently with the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312). It was, in accordance with FDA guidelines for pre\u2010Phase I exploratory studies (https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/ACT_Checklist.pdf), not preregistered on clinicaltrials.gov.",
                        "During the first week of the trial, rhGH alone (0.015\u00a0mg/kg) was administered to obtain an initial insulin response, and during the second week, rhGH was combined with 50\u00a0mg DHEA to evaluate insulin suppression by DHEA alone. During the third week, the same doses of rhGH and DHEA were combined with 500\u00a0mg metformin. Beginning at the fourth week, all doses were individualized based on each volunteer's particular responses. Thereafter, blood was collected one week prior to trial months 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 to enable further dose adjustments at those time points (to maximize IGF\u20101 and minimize insulin), and additional blood samples were obtained at 12\u00a0months to conclude the treatment monitoring period. Dosing compliance was verified by the response of IGF\u20101, DHEAS, and insulin to administration of rhGH, DHEA, and metformin, respectively; by frequent communication with trial volunteers; and by retrospective review of returned medication diaries. Additional follow\u2010up blood testing was done at 18\u00a0months for cohort 1; cohort 2 was not available. In selected cases, as deemed useful, supplemental blood sampling was carried out at other times.",
                        "Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cryopreserved at the SBC, in the latter case using 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and fetal bovine serum (FBS), and stored there and then at the HIMC until the end of the trial to enable simultaneous CyTOF analysis and further distribution of some samples to other centers. Complete blood counts were performed by Quest Diagnostics to enable correction for cell losses caused by freezing and thawing or other factors, but in general, the need for correction was avoided by reporting cell subsets as percentages of their reference populations (e.g., na\u00efve CD4 cells as a percent of total CD4 cells) and by gating to intact viable singlets. Other blood assays are described in Appendix S2.",

All volunteers were also provided with and asked to take supplements of 3,000\u00a0IU vitamin D3 and 50\u00a0mg of elemental zinc daily."

Standardized methods for quantitatively determining thymic fat content have not been previously described, so we employed a computational methodology that has previously been applied to the analysis of bone marrow fat content (Hu, Nayak, & Goran, 2011). These methods for quantifying fat have been shown to be more accurate than standard histopathological assessment by biopsy (Fischer et al., 2012) and provide the thymic fat fraction (TFF) as a number from 0% to 100%. TFF was determined in three replicate central thymic regions at each tested time point and was used to compute the thymic fat\u2010free fraction (TFFF) as 100% \u2010 TFF. The same methods were also applied to determine the sternal bone marrow fat\u2010free fraction (BMFFF). For more details, see Appendix S2."

                        "The state of genomic DNA methylation was determined in previously cryopreserved PBMCs at the Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics at the University of British Columbia. Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and bisulfite conversion of extracted DNA was performed using a Zymo EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). DNA methylation (DNAm) analysis was performed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), which measures single\u2010CpG resolution DNAm levels at 866,836 CpG sites in the human genome. Methylation at specific sites was calculated as \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0Max(M,0)/[Max(M,0)\u00a0+\u00a0Max(U,0)], where Max(M,0) is the fluorescence intensity of methylated (M) alleles (signal A) and Max(U,0) is the fluorescence of un\u2010methylated (U) alleles (signal B). Thus, \u03b2 values range from 0 (completely un\u2010methylated) to 1 (completely methylated) (Dunning, Barbosa\u2010Morais, Lynch, Tavare, & Ritchie, 2008).",

Second, to isolate more detailed individual\u2010 and time\u2010specific changes, we calculated the change in epigenetic versus chronological age for each volunteer as (EA\u2010A) \u2013 (EA\u2010A)0 as described in the text, where EA is the epigenetic age at chronological age A and (EA\u2010A)0 is the baseline difference between EA and A."

When correction for time was not necessary, we used ordinary linear or nonlinear regressions. For comparisons between pretreatment and specific post\u2010treatment endpoints, we employed the t test, the t test for paired comparisons, or alternatives selected by SigmaPlot when the assumptions underlying t tests were not justified. To enable normalized comparisons to month zero baselines, replicate results for each volunteer at time zero were averaged and each replicate result was divided by the mean to produce a population of departures from 100% that could then be used for comparison against later time points. Reported P values do not correct for multiple comparisons because independent hypothesis testing was not carried out in most cases, and in the case of both multiple tests for epigenetic age and significant differences in CyTOF results, all significant test results were highly correlated, making Bonferroni correction overly conservative."
