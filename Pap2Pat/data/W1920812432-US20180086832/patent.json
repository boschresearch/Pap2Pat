    "abstract": "Mutant epitopes encoded by cancer genes are virtually always located in the interior of cells, making them invisible to conventional antibodies. We generated single chain variable fragments (scFvs) specific for mutant peptides presented on the cell surface by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. These scFvs can be converted to full-length antibodies, termed MANAbodies, targeting \u201cMutation Associated Neo-Antigens\u201d bound to HLA. A phage display library representing a highly diverse array of single-chain variable fragment sequences was first designed and constructed. A competitive selection protocol was then used to identify clones specific for peptides bound to pre-defined HLA types. In this way, we obtained scFvs, including one specific for a peptide encoded by a common KRAS mutant and another by a common EGFR mutant. Molecules targeting MANA can be developed that specifically react with mutant peptide-HLA complexes even when these peptides differ by only one amino acid from the normal, wild-type form.",

                        "Cancers are the result of sequential mutations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (1). In theory, somatic mutations are ideal therapeutic targets because they are not found in virtually any normal cell (2). Even though the protein products of these mutations generally only subtly differ from the wild type (wt) form, often by a single amino acid, this difference is sufficient for effective targeting. When the protein is an enzyme, such as that encoded by BRAF, the resulting structural change can provide a pocket for the binding of specific enzymatic inhibitors (3-5). Antibodies are one of the most successful types of modern pharmaceutical agents and have been shown to be able to specifically recognize proteins that differ only by a single amino acid or by the modification of a single amino acid (5-11). However, all antibodies used in the clinic are directed against cell surface or secreted proteins rather than intracellular proteins. Intracellular proteins are not accessible to large molecules such as antibodies, but unfortunately, the vast majority of the abnormal epitopes encoded by mutant genes are not on the cell surface (2).",
                        "Intracellular antigens, such as viral components, can be recognized by the immune system, though this recognition is based on recognition of proteolytically-processed peptides complexed to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on the cell surface (12). Indeed, 10% to 20% of the epitopes created by mutant genes in cancers (hereinafter referred to as MANAs, for Mutation-Associated Neo-Antigens) are predicted to bind to common HLA types (12). Moreover, examples of T-cells that can bind to such peptide-HLA complexes have been found in patients as well as in experimental animals (13-16).",
                        "The majority of T cell responses generated in vivo against MANAs are \u201cprivate,\u201d i.e., directed against mutant epitopes encoded by passenger mutations that are present in cancers of individual patients or mice but are not commonly found in patients and do not drive neoplastic growth (2). Immunologic agents targeting such antigens are only useful for the treatment of the individual patients harboring the particular MANA (16-20).",
                        "There is a continuing need in the art to identify new therapeutic, diagnostic, and analytic agents for diseases including but not limited to cancer."

                        "We have developed an approach to generate and identify antibody variable regions that selectively target complexes containing common HLA types bound to peptide products of commonly mutated oncogenes. As these HLA-peptide complexes are expected to be exclusively present on the surface of cancer cells or other disease related cells, antibodies targeting them could in principle be used for therapeutic or monitoring purposes. These same approaches for identifying antibody variable regions can also be used to identify T cell receptors.",
                        "Mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes drive tumorigenesis, and their protein products form therapeutic targets that are absent from normal cells. However, nearly all such mutant epitopes lie in the interior of the cells, either in the cytoplasm or nucleus, complicating immunotherapies directed against the mutants. The antibody variable regions and T cell receptors described here overcome the shielding of intracellular targets lying within cells by targeting forms that are displayed on the surface of cells. Nonetheless, the methods and approaches described here may be used not solely for tumor suppressors and oncogenes, but also passenger mutations (not drivers of carcinogenesis) as well as for other proteins that are the product of somatic mutagenesis or which are expressed on cell surfaces as the result of somatic mutagenesis.",
                        "Examples of intracellular proteins which may be targeted include without limitations EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, p53, PIK3CA, ABL1, beta-catenin, and IDH1/2. In order to have widest applicability, it is desirable to select mutations that are prevalent in cancer populations. Examples of such mutations include those in residues EGFR L858, KRAS G12, KRAS G13, HRAS G12, NRAS G12, HRAS Q61, NRAS Q61, IDH1 R132, beta-catenin S45, IDH2 R140, and IDH2 R172. Common mutants include EGFR L858R, KRAS G12V, KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D, HRAS Q61P, NRAS Q61P, HRAS Q61R, NRAS Q61R, HRAS Q61K, NRAS Q61K, EGFR T790M, IDH1 R132H, beta-catenin S45F, IDH2 R140Q, and IDH2 R172K. However, even a private or personal disease specific mutation coding for an epitope that is intracellular may be the target of an scFv or Fab or T cell receptors.",
                        "Libraries which can be made and screened include any that produce useful specific binding molecules, such as scFv, Fab, and TCR. The complexity of the repertoire of binding molecules is preferably very high. The libraries may be made in any suitable vector system, including but not limited to M13 phage, ribosomes, and yeast. For Fab libraries see Lee et al., J Mol Biol. \u201cHigh-affinity human antibodies from phage-displayed synthetic Fab libraries with a single framework scaffold,\u201d 2004 Jul. 23; 340:1073-93. For T cell receptor libraries see Kieke et al., \u201cSelection of functional T cell receptor mutants from a yeast surface-display library,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1999; 96: 5651-5656. For ribosome display libraries see Stafford et al., Protein Eng Des Sel. \u201cIn vitro Fab display: a cell-free system for IgG discovery.\u201d 2014; 27:97-109. Libraries may be made using synthetic oligonucleotides, synthetic trimers, or synthetic deoxyribonucleotides, for example. Each option permits biasing of the mixtures to bias the ultimate library composition.",
                        "The rarity of the desired scFv or Fab or TCR in a library is in some part due to the nature of the desired target. The desired target comprises a complex of an HLA molecule, a \u03b2-2-microblobulin protein, and a peptide. However, of this whole complex, the desired scFv or Fab or TCR will only recognize a particular epitope that contains a mutant residue, most likely a substitution of one amino acid for another. Moreover, it will not specifically recognize the same macromolecular complex in which the residue is wild-type. Because of this extremely narrow focus, a strong selection process is required, in addition to an extraordinary amount of diversity in the library. A positive selection step for the desired scFv or Fab or T cell receptors has been devised which is performed in the presence of a competitor complex. The competitor complex comprises wild-type form of the peptide bound to HLA and \u03b2-2 microglobulin. Alternatively, the competitor complex may comprise a peptide with a highly similar sequence to the mutant peptide, such as a peptide with one or more additional mutant residues or a peptide with an alternate, non-wild-type, residue at the same residue as the mutant peptide. The positive selection agent comprises HLA, \u03b2-2-microglobulin, and the \u201cmutant\u201d peptide. Optionally, the competitive selection step will be performed repeatedly. As the step is repeatedly performed, the ratio of competitor complex to positive selection agent can be increased. Optionally, the competitive panning is followed by a negative selection step using the competitor complex. Optionally the competitive complex and/or the positive selection agent may be displayed or expressed on the surface of a cell for the selection step. In an alternative aspect of the invention, this type of selection process may be used to pan for binding molecules that recognize a single amino acid difference in a protein or peptide that is not part of an HLA/\u03b2-2 microglobulin complex. In a further option, the peptide does not represent an intracellular epitope.",
                        "The HLA molecule which is used to present peptide with a mutant residue may be from any HLA gene (A, B, C, E. F, and G) and allele of those genes. More prevalent genes and alleles, such as HLA-A2, HLA-A3, and HLA-B7, will find wider usage among human patients of some groups. Other HLA genes which may be used are HLA DP, DM, DOA, DOB, DQ, and DR.",
                        "When useful molecules are identified that specifically bind to a complex of (1) an HLA molecule, (2) a \u03b2-2-microglobulin, and (3) a peptide comprising a mutant residue (found in an intracellular epitope in the full native protein) they can be used for various purposes and in various derivatives. The molecules can be bound or attached to a detectable label. Detectable labels can be any that are known in the art including, without limitation, radionuclides, chromophores, enzymes, and fluorescent molecules. Such molecules can be used, for example, to monitor anti-tumor therapy or to detect cancer cells in a sample, or to diagnose cancer. The molecules can alternatively be bound, conjugated, or attached to a therapeutic agent. Such therapeutic agents can be specifically targeted to cells expressing the protein by means of the scFv or Fab or T cell receptor identified. Another derivative of the identified molecule that may be usefully made is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). This derivative includes as part of a single protein, the identified molecule comprising an antibody variable region, a hinge region, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain. See, e.g., Curran et al., \u201cChimeric antigen receptors for T cell immunotherapy: current understanding and future directions,\u201d J. Gene Med 2012; 14: 405-415. The CDR sequences of a useful molecule may be incorporated into an intact antibody, to form a MANAbody, as described in the examples. Alternatively, the useful molecule is not a part of an intact antibody molecule. The useful molecule may also be included as part of a chimeric protein with another scFv/antibody, such as an anti-CD3 scFv, to form a bispecific targeting agent. Such a chimeric protein may be used to target T cells to the tumor, inducing anti-tumor activity.",
                        "Any diagnostic technique known in the art, particularly any immunological diagnostic technique, can be used with the useful molecules. They can be used on samples that are tissue samples or tissue homogenates, for example. They can be used in immunohistochemistry, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, immunoblots, etc. Detection will be dependent on the detectable label that is attached or used to identify immune complexes. Any detection technique can be used. Therapeutic administration can be accomplished using any known means suitable for administering an antibody or specific binding molecule. Administration may be by injection or infusion into the peripheral circulatory system, for example, or intratumoral, intraspinal, intracerebellar, intraperitoneal, etc.",
                        "We have established a procedure for generating scFvs that selectively bind to mutant peptides embedded within HLA-beta-2 microglobulin complexes. Using this procedure, we obtained scFvs against the products of two commonly mutated oncogenes (KRAS and EGFR) when complexed with two common HLA types (A2 and A3, respectively). These scFvs bind to the peptide-HLA complexes on the surface of cells and can kill those cells when complement is present. Converting an scFv into a complete, bivalent antibody containing the Fc region sometimes results in loss of affinity (46, 47). However, we successfully generated a complete antibody using the D10 scFv sequence, and this MANAbody retained the specificity of the scFv (FIG. 4B, FIG. 15). We have not yet attempted to generate a MANAbody using the C9 scFv directed to the mutant EGFR peptide complexed with HLA-A3.",
                        "Other antibodies, termed TCRmimics, have been generated against peptide-HLA complexes in the past (48-49). A first important aspect of our study is the generation of antibody-based reagents that differentially recognize HLA complexes containing peptides varying only by a single amino acid. A second important aspect of our study is that the variant peptides are commonly found in human cancers.",
                        "The greatest challenge in both cancer diagnosis and therapy is specificity\u2014developing reagents that recognize or kill cancer cells but not normal cells. The relative lack of specificity currently presents a major obstacle for the wider implementation of powerful immunotherapeutic agents such as chimeric antigen receptors and bi-specific antibodies (57-60). In this context, specific somatic mutations that alter the encoded proteins of cancer driver genes represent biochemical features that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells in unparalleled fashion. The strength of the work described here is that it demonstrates the feasibility of generating highly specific reagents that recognize these altered proteins in a context that is clinically relevant (cell surface). This sets the stage for further exploration of such reagents and their incorporation into suitable diagnostic and therapeutic vehicles.",

This phagemid contains an F1 origin, and a transcriptional repressor unit consisting of a lac operator and a lac repressor to limit uninduced expression. The scFv was synthesized with a pelB periplasmic secretion signal and was subcloned downstream of the lac operator. A myc epitope tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage recognition sequence was placed immediately downstream of the variable heavy chain, which was followed in frame by the full length M13 pIII coat protein sequence. (FIG. 5) Successful cloning was confirmed by Sanger sequencing 45 random clones obtained from transformation of a small portion of the ligated product.

It should be noted that after heat-denaturation, only the biotinylated HLA molecule, but not the peptide or beta-2-microglobulin, will be able to bind the MyOne T1 beads. This step is referred to as \u201cnegative selection,\u201d necessary to remove any phage recognizing either streptavidin or denatured monomer, present to a small extent in every preparation of biotinylated monomer. After this negative selection, beads were immobilized with a DynaMag-2 magnet (Life Technologies) and the supernatant containing unbound phage was transferred for positive selection against the mutant KRAS-HLA-A2 monomer.

                                "Design and construction of an scFv-based phage display-based scFv library. We began these studies with attempts to generate an antibody against a mutant KRAS peptide in mice (basis for this choice described below). Using conventional approaches to derive monoclonal antibodies after mouse immunization, these efforts failed, as no antibodies specifically reactive with the MANAs were identified. We therefore turned to phage display approaches for generating MANAbodies (FIG. 1). The design of the phage display library followed principles employed in published studies (22) and included some special features. The framework of the library was based on the scFv sequence of humanized 4D5 antibody (Trastuzumab), generated against the protein encoded by ERBB2 (23). This framework was chosen by virtue of its stability on phage and its ease of conversion to a soluble scFv, Fab, or antibody (22, 24). High-resolution crystal structures of the humanized 4D5 have identified the residues within the highly-variable, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that play the most significant role in antigen binding (25). This allowed us to focus variability on the most important residues for antigen binding rather than backbone residues. In our library, amino acid substitutions were limited to defined paratope residues in four CDRs, CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 (26). We skewed the library to include specific amino acids within the CDRs that either were previously demonstrated to play a significant role in antigen binding or were enriched in naturally occurring antibodies. One important randomization was at CDR-L3, which contained a mixture of serines and tyrosines, two amino acids previously shown to facilitate a minimalist approach to library design (26, 27). CDRs in the heavy chain have been shown to play a more significant role in antigen-binding diversity (28-30), and we therefore introduced more degeneracy in the heavy chain CDRs than in the light chain CDRs. Additionally, at locations wherein increased diversity was sought, the more commonly used IUB nucleotides (designated NNK and NNS degenerate codons) were substituted by DMT codons; this eliminated unwanted residues. In all cases, we employed degenerate nucleotide mixtures intended to minimize the incorporation of sequences resulting in cysteine or stop codons. Finally, we introduced length polymorphisms in CDR-H3, allowing for a stem-loop binding length diversity of 7 amino acids. These changes resulted in a calculated theoretical library complexity of 5\u00d71013.",
                                "The synthesized oligonucleotide library was cloned into a phagemid vector for scFv expression. This scFv carried a myc tag and was fused to the bacteriophage M13 pill coat protein through a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site (FIG. 5). This design facilitated purification of scFvs from the phage particles and provided an alternative elution method, accomplished via TEV cleavage, during the subsequent phage-selection process. After library synthesis, 45 clones were sequenced by the Sanger method. The sequencing showed a library success rate of 53%, as defined by the absence of mutations within the framework region and the presence of the expected amino acids within the CDRs. Library diversity was calculated based on transformation efficiencies achieved during library construction, resulting in an estimated diversity of 5.5\u00d7109. To further assess the quality of the library, the library was subjected to massively parallel sequencing (31). This analysis revealed 3,785,138 unique clones (46.5% of all clones analyzed). The sequenced region included only the CDR-H3 and not the other three CDRs (CDR-L3, CDR-H1, and CDR-H2) that were systematically varied. The fraction (46.5%) of unique clones therefore represents a minimum estimate of the diversity. Translation of a random subset of sequences further showed the expected amino acid distribution as well as length diversity in CDR-H3."

We chose MANAbody targets based on the frequency of particular mutations and the strength of their predicted binding to HLA alleles. KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers, with mutations particularly prevalent in pancreatic, colorectal, and lung adenocarcinomas. We chose the G12V mutation as the target because a relevant peptide containing it was predicted to bind with high affinity to the HLA-A2, which is the most common HLA allele in many ethnic groups (32). This in silico prediction was made using the NetMHC v3.4 algorithm (33-35). Additionally, the critical mutant residue (V at codon 12) was expected to be exposed on the surface of the HLA protein based on structural studies of other peptide HLA-complexes (36). The peptide KLVVVGAVGV (SEQ ID NO: 4), in which the valine residue (V) at position 8 represents the G12V mutation, was chemically synthesized by conventional means. Peptides corresponding to the product of a mutant allele will henceforth be termed \u201cmutant peptides,\u201d while peptides representing the product of a wt allele will be referred to as \u201cwt peptides.\u201d The mutant KRAS peptide was then folded into a complex (monomer) of HLA-A2 and beta-2-microglobulin [KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2]. Two peptides corresponding to wt KRAS sequences were also synthesized and folded with HLA-A2 or HLA-A3 to form KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 and KRAS(WT)-HLA-A3 monomers, respectively. Additional mutant KRAS monomers corresponding to other codon 12 mutations were also assembled. In most cases, monomers were biotinylated to facilitate purification and subsequent experimentation (see Materials and Methods).",
                                "The phage display selection process consisted of 10 rounds of selection and amplification, which were divided into three distinct phases: an enrichment phase (rounds 1-3), a competitive phase (rounds 4-8), and a final selection phase (rounds 9-10) (FIG. 6). The overall objective of these phases was to maximize recovery of clones that bound KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 better than KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 or HLA alone. In each round of the enrichment phase, negative selection with heat-denatured biotinylated HLA-A2 monomers was followed by positive selection with KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 (FIG. 6A and Materials and Methods). In each successive round (rounds 2 and 3), the amount of KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 monomer was reduced to enrich for stronger binders.",
                                "The novel competitive phase described in this study was intended to enrich for the rare mutant KRAS-(G12V)-HLA-A2 binders over KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 binders and the much more frequent pan-HLA binders that we expected to be present in the library following the enrichment phase. Each round of the competitive phase began with negative selection using denatured HLA-A2 and native HLA-A3 monomers (FIG. 6B). Then, the phage were simultaneously incubated with KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 bound to streptavidin magnetic beads and KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 bound to streptavidin agarose beads. KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 served as a competitor, as phage bound to it would not be recovered in the magnetic bead trapping step (FIG. 6B). Moreover, in each round of the competitive phase, decreasing amounts of KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2, but the same amount of KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2, were employed in an attempt to enrich for high affinity binders. In the final selection phase, each round started with stringent negative selection using a vast excess of denatured and native KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 monomer and proceeded with positive selection with KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 monomer (FIG. 6C)."

After the enrichment phase (FIG. 6A), the selected phage (en masse) did not show preference for mutant over wt KRAS peptides complexed to HLA-A2, or preference for KRAS peptides bound to HLA-A2 over KRAS peptides bound to HLA-A3. (FIG. 7A.) Only after the final selection phase (FIG. 6C) did specificity for mutant KRAS bound to HLA-A2 emerge. In particular, these phage bound to KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 better than to KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 or to KRAS(WT)-HLA-A3 (FIG. 7B). These phage were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded in a 96-well plate format. One clone (D10; SEQ ID NO: 37) showed substantial binding to the KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 monomer (FIG. 2A). The D10 clone was highly specific to KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2, as it failed to bind all other monomers tested (FIG. 2B).",

The scFv portion was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector containing either a Flag or a V5 epitope tag in addition to a 6\u00d7 His tag. This facilitated high-level expression and affinity purification of D10 scFv. Similar to the phage expressing D10 scFv:pIII fusion protein, purified D10 scFv interacted with KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 in a highly specific fashion (FIG. 2C). Importantly, the D10 scFv did not show any binding above background to KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2, KRAS(WT)-HLA-A3, or to other KRAS mutants (KRAS G12C or KRAS G12D) bound to HLA-A2. Additionally, D10 scFv did not bind to KRAS peptides when not complexed with HLA proteins (FIG. 8). These results demonstrate successful selection for scFv bound to peptides in the context of HLA.",
                                "Affinity Maturation. The affinity of the D10 scFv for KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 was estimated to be 49 nM, using the AlphaScreen\u00ae method of affinity measurement (37). We next proceeded to affinity mature D10. Briefly, a library of D10 scFv mutagenized through error-prone PCR was generated from the original D10 scFv sequence and subject to three rounds of selection against the KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 and KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 monomers. Evaluation of the clones yielded a candidate, D10-7, which showed a newly acquired capacity to bind to KRAS(G12C)-HLA-A2, while still retaining the ability to differentiate between mutant and wild type KRAS epitopes (FIG. 9). To compare D10-7 and D10 for their relative binding to KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2, we used off-rate based assays to measure the koff value. Unlike affinity measurements, these assays allow for rapid comparison of multiple scFvs within the same test, thus providing a more direct comparison of the relative binding of multiple clones (38). The off-rate measurements showed an almost two-fold decrease in the disassociation rate constant for the affinity-matured D10-7 scFv (3.2\u00d710-6 sec-1) as compared to the D10 scFv (5.7\u00d710-6 sec-1). No measurable binding of the KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 monomer to these scFvs occurred, documenting that the koff for KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2 was at least 200-fold lower than for KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2. The large differential binding of these scFvs to mutant vs. wt peptides complexed with HLA-A2 was also evident in the other assays described below."

To determine whether this approach was applicable to other MANAs, we sought to identify scFvs specific for a mutant EGFR peptide complexed to different HLA allele. The EGFR L858R mutation is found in \u02dc10% of lung adenocarcinomas and accounts for \u02dc40% of all EGFR mutations in this cancer type (39). Codon 858 is in the cytoplasmic domain, rather than the extracellular or membrane domains, of the EGFR protein and normally should not be visible on the cell surface (40). A peptide (KITDFGRAK; SEQ ID NO: 9) containing this mutation was predicted to bind at high-affinity to the HLA-A3 allele when analyzed by the NetMHC v3.4 algorithm. To identify scFvs specific to this peptide-HLA complex, we adopted a modified scheme of selection and amplification in which decreasing concentrations of Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were used to reduce scFv expression in the later rounds. Additionally, the number of rounds in each selection phase was adjusted to favor the enrichment of desired phage rather than the elimination of undesired ones (FIG. 9 compared to FIG. 6, also see Materials and Methods). With these modifications, we were able to obtain a phage clone (C9; SEQ ID NO: 39) that showed selective binding to mutant EGFR peptide complexed to HLA-A3 [EGFR(L858R)-HLA-A3], compared to a variety of control monomers, including wt EGFR bound to HLA-A3 (FIG. 2D). The C9 scFv generated from this clone showed similar selective binding to EGFR(L858R)-HLA-A3 (FIG. 2E). The estimated koff of the mutant EGFR peptide bound to HLA-A3 was an order of magnitude lower than the koff of the wt peptide (value of 2.6\u00d710\u22126 sec\u22121 vs. 3.0\u00d710\u22125 sec\u22121, respectively)."

We next attempted to determine whether the D10 and C9 scFvs would bind to mutant KRAS and EGFR peptide-HLA complexes on the surface of cells. The T2 cell line was derived from an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblast line defective in presentation of endogenous HLA-associated peptide antigens due to a deletion that involves genes for TAP1 and TAP2 peptide transporters (41). T2A3 is a modified version of T2 with stable expression of the HLA-A3 transgene (42, 43). T2 and T2A3 cells express low levels of HLA that can be stabilized by addition of exogenous HLA-binding peptides, and thus can serve as a platform for assaying interactions with specific HLA-binding peptides (44, 45). We first pulsed T2 cells with KRAS(G12V), KRAS(WT), or a negative control peptide. To assess loading efficiency, we used the W6/32 antibody that targets HLA molecules stabilized by any HLA-binding peptides. The efficiency of peptide loading between wild type and mutant peptides were comparable as suggested by anti-W6/32 staining (FIG. 11). Analysis of the pulsed cells by flow cytometry after incubation with D10 phage showed that binding of the D10 phage to KRAS(G12V) peptide-pulsed cells was evident, while marginal binding (over background) to the KRAS(WT) or control peptide-pulsed cells was observed (FIG. 3A, FIG. S8). A similar experiment with purified D10 scFv rather than D10 phage confirmed the selective binding to KRAS(G12V) presented on the cell surface (FIG. 3B). We also pulsed T2A3 cells with mutant EGFR(L858R), EGFR(WT), or a negative control peptide, and assessed C9 phage binding by flow cytometry. Again, binding of the C9 phage to the EGFR(L858R) peptide-pulsed cells was evident, while no binding to the EGFR(WT) or control peptide-pulsed cells was observed (FIG. 3C, FIG. 13). Only background fluorescence was observed when phage or scFvs were not included in the reaction or the cells were not loaded with the peptides (FIG. 3A-3C, FIGS. 12 and 13).",
                                "We next sought to determine whether T2 cells pulsed with the mutant KRAS(G12V) peptide could be targeted by D10 scFv and killed in a Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) assay. As a positive control, we pulsed T2 cells with KRAS(G12V) or KRAS(WT), peptides and performed a CDC assay with the W6/32 antibody. As expected, the antibody killed peptide-pulsed T2 cells efficiently in the presence of complement (FIG. 14). We then tested D10 scFv and the affinity-matured D10-7 scFv, both conjugated to an anti-V5 epitope tag antibody containing the complement-fixing Fc region in the CDC assay. Both scFvs killed the KRAS(G12V)-pulsed T2 cells in a dose-dependent fashion and the affinity-matured D10-7 scFv showed a remarkable improvement in killing efficiency (EC50 of 0.79 nM for D10-7 vs. EC50 of 11.2 nM for D10, FIG. 3D). In contrast, cells pulsed with KRAS(WT) or not pulsed with exogenous peptides showed only marginal cell death."

Clinical applications of immunotherapeutic reagents generally employ complete antibodies, including the Fc domain, rather than just the scFv component. Another attribute of complete antibodies is the higher avidity achieved as a result of bivalency of the initially monovalent scFvs. To generate a complet MANAbody from the D10 scFv, we grafted the D10 scFv sequence onto the constant region of the clinically used humanized 4D5 antibody trastuzumab. High levels of expression of the D10 MANAbody were achieved in mammalian cells (139 milligrams of protein per liter of Expi293 cell culture). Similar to the D10 scFv, the D10 MANAbody interacted with KRAS(G12V)-HLA-A2, as assessed by ELISA (FIG. 4A). No binding was observed to the KRAS(WT)-HLA-A2 monomer or to any other monomer tested. The D10 MANAbody also showed relatively stronger staining of T2 cells pulsed with the mutant KRAS(G12V) peptide, compared to those pulsed with KRAS (WT) or a negative control peptide (FIG. 4B, FIG. 15). Finally, the observed half-life of the full-length D10 MANAbody was similar to that of its scFv derivative when assessed for its monovalent dissassociation. Thus, D10 MANAbody retained the high specificity and low dissociation rate constant observed with the D10 scFv."
