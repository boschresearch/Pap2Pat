Dysregulation of RNA processes underlies a plethora of diseases3. Tethering of RNA effector domains from natural RNA processing enzymes by heterologous RNA binding proteins (e.g., Pumilio and MS2)4, 5, have allowed artificial regulation of RNA processes, and may enable targeted RNA therapeutics. These artificial RNA effectors require either protein engineering or insertion of artificial tags to target RNA, and depend on short recognition sequences, thus affording only limited targeting flexibility or specificity."

In eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, transcribed RNA comprises exons, which encode proteins, and intervening intron sequences, which do not encode proteins. Splicing is the process of removing the intron sequences and joining the remaining exon sequences to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA).",
                        "Alternative splicing occurs when a single gene codes for multiple proteins because one or more exons are included or excluded from the mature mRNA. The production of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated by trans-activating proteins (splicing factors) that bind to cis-activating sites on the mRNA transcript (splice acceptor sites). The proteins translated from alternatively spliced mRNAs have different amino acid sequences, which often translate into differences in biological function."

                                "RNA splicing factors of the present disclosure, in some embodiments, are linked to a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease. Programmable nuclease are nucleases that can be targeted to a specific site (e.g., nucleotide or sequence of nucleotides) within a nucleic acid (e.g., within a gene (or genome) and/or a gene transcript). Examples of the most common programmable nucleases include zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and RNA-guided engineered nucleases (RGENs) derived from the bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. Programmable nucleases include both deoxyribonucleases, which catalyze cleavage of DNA, and ribonucleases, which catalyze cleavage of RNA. Several known programmable nucleases, such as Cas nucleases, have been shown to function as both a deoxyribonuclease and a ribonuclease. In some embodiments, a programmable nuclease of the present disclosure is a programmable deoxyribonuclease. In other embodiments, a programmable nuclease of the present disclosure is a programmable ribonuclease.",

Science 2016; 353(6299):aaf5573; and Abudayyeh O O et al. Nature 2017; 550:280-284), Cas13b ribonucleases (see, e.g., Cox D B T et al. Science 2017; 358(6366):1019-1027), Cas13d ribonucleases (see e.g., Zhang et al., Cell 2018 175(1), 212-223 e217 and Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 endonuclease (see, e.g., Lee C M et al. Mol Ther 2016; 24(3):645-654). In some embodiments, the programmable ribonuclease is a type VI-D CRISPR-Cas ribonuclease is dCasRx (Konermann, S et al. Cell 2018; 173:665-676). Other programmable nucleases may be used, in some embodiments, including Staphylococcus aureus Cas9, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, Campylobacter jejuni Cas9, and Neisseria meningitides Cas9, each of which have been shown to be capable of targeting both DNA and RNA (see, e.g., Strutt S C et al. eLife 2018; 7:e32724; Dugar et al., Molecular Cell 2018; 69(5), 893-905 e897; and Rousseau B A et al. Molecular Cell 2018; 69(5):P906-914). In some embodiments, the programmable nuclease is selected from catalytically inactive type VI-D CRISPR-Cas ribonucleases, C2c2/Cas13a ribonucleases, Cas13b ribonucleases, and Cas13d ribonucleases. In some embodiments, the programmable nuclease is a Neisseria meningitides Cas9 protein. Programmable nucleases are rendered inactive, in some embodiments, through mutation of the naturally-occurring enzymes.",

CasRx is a class 2 CRISPR-Cas ribonuclease protein that comprises two HEPN (RxxxxH) ribonuclease motifs. Point mutations (i.e., R295A, H300A, R849A, H854A) of catalytic residues in the HEPN motifs of the CasRx protein results in inactivation of ribonuclease activity without inhibiting the targeting of dCasRx to the coding portion of the mRNA.",
                                "In some embodiments, an RNA splicing factor is fused to a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease. A fusion protein comprises a two or more linked polypeptides that are encoded by a single or separate nucleic acid sequences (e.g., two or more separate nucleic acid sequences). Fusion proteins are typically recombinantly produced, wherein the polynucleotides that encode the fusion protein are in a system that supports the expression of the two or more linked polynucleotides, for example, and the translation of the resulting polynucleotides into recombinant polypeptides. Fusion proteins (or other fusion polypeptides) may be configured in multiple arrangements. An RNA splicing factor, in some embodiments, is fused to the amino terminus (N terminus) of a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease. In other embodiments, an RNA splicing factor is fused to the carboxy terminus (C terminus) of a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease.",
                                "In some embodiments, the catalytically inactive programmable nuclease is in a \u201csplit\u201d form, whereby the coding sequence of the nuclease is split, creating two fragments that can be encoded separately (e.g., encoded on separate nucleic acids and/or vectors) but joined together once expressed to render an active artificial RNA-guided splicing factor. Such a split form allows, e.g., for the packaging of the active artificial RNA-guided splicing factor in two or more vectors, such as viral vectors including AAV. In some embodiments, the two fragments each comprise a fragment of an intein which can be (self-) spliced together. For example, in some embodiments the artificial RNA-guided splicing factor comprises an N-terminal fragment of a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease linked to an N-terminal fragment of an intein and a C-terminal fragment of a catalytically inactive programmable nuclease linked to a C-terminal fragment of an intein, wherein the N-terminal fragment and the C-terminal fragment of the intein catalyze joining of the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of the catalytically inactive programmable nuclease to produce the full-length artificial RNA-guided splicing factor. In some embodiments the intein utilized is the Npu DnaE intein (see e.g., Zettler et al., FEBS Lett. 2009 Mar. 4; 583(5):909-14). Inteins suitable for use in embodiments described herein are well known in the art, and include those provided in International Publication No. WO 2019/075200, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety."

A C840T mutation in Exon 7 of the SMN2 gene creates an exonic splicing suppressor (ESS) that leads to exclusion of Exon 7 during pre-mRNA splicing. The exclusion of Exon 7 results in roughly 90% truncated, non-functional SMN protein, which is rapidly degraded. Subjects with SMN2 exon exclusion have approximately only 10% of functional SMN protein, which is insufficient to sustain survival of spinal motor neurons in the CNS, resulting in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).",

Four types of SMA (I-IV) are recognized depending upon the age of onset, the maximum muscular activity achieved, and survival. In individuals with SMA, degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord results in skeletal muscular atrophy and weakness most commonly involving the limbs.",

Four gRNAs (gSMN2-1 through gSMN2-4) were designed within the intron between SMN2-E7 and E8. When transfected with pCI-SMN2 and control GFP plasmid (pmaxGFP), SMN2 minigene expressed predominantly exclusion isoform (FIG. 1B, lane 1). When transfected with RBFOX1N-dCasRx-C and individual gRNAs, inclusion isoform level increased (FIG. 1B, lanes 11-14, see upper bands). Introduction of pools of two, three or four gRNAs simultaneously, increased further E7-included transcripts, as well as decreased the level of E7-excluded transcripts, switching the splicing pattern to predominantly inclusion (FIG. 1B, lanes 15-16). SMN2-E7 activation is dependent on RBFOX1 effector because dCasRx alone did not result in activation (FIG. 1B, lanes 2-9). Activation is also dependent on binding of the RBFOX1N-dCasRx-C on the SMN2 intron as control gRNAs (\u201cC\u201d) did not induce SMN2-E7 inclusion (FIG. 1B, lanes 2 and 10). To further quantitate the effect of SMN2-E7 activation, we conducted quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR green reagents and primer pairs corresponding to E7-inclusion or E7-exclusion isoforms (FIG. 1C). We observed fold changes of inc/exc ratio compared to control GFP transfection consistent with the patterns observed in the semiquantitative RT-PCR assay, with pools of three gRNAs (gSMN2-1 through 3) giving the highest fold change."

                        "HEK293T cDNA was used as a source for PCR-amplification of coding sequences of splicing factors or other RNA binding proteins. Alternatively, geneBlocks (gBlocks) encoding human codon optimized versions of their coding sequences were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; Coralville, Iowa USA) to serve as PCR template. The pXR002: EF1a-dCasRx-2A-EGFP plasmid (Addgene #109050) served as PCR template for dCasRx coding sequence. Coding sequence of a Neisseria meningitidis Cas9 (dNMCas9) was PCR-amplified from pHAGE-TO-dCas9-3\u00d7GFP (Addgene #64107). The coding sequences of the CRISPR Artificial Splicing Factors (CASFx) were then cloned into pmax expression vector (Lonza; Basel, Switzerland) by a combination of fusion PCR, restriction-ligation cloning and Sequence- and Ligation-Independent Cloning (SLIC) [DOI: 10.1128/AEM.00844-12] fusing the coding sequences splicing factors with those of dCasRx or dNMCas9 via polypeptide linkers. gRNA expression cloning plasmids were generated by similar procedures using IDT oligonucleotides encoding CasRx gRNA direct repeat and PCR reaction using a ccdbCam selection cassette (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif. USA) and a U6-containing plasmid as templates. Two BbsI restriction sites flanking the ccdbCam selection cassette serves as the restriction cloning sites for insertion of target-specific spacers. Target-specific spacer sequences were then cloned into the gRNA expression plasmids by annealed oligonucleotide ligation.",

USA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco; Gaithersburg, Md. USA). Incubator conditions were 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2. For activation experiments, cells were seeded into 12-well plates at 100,000 cells per well the day before being transfected with 600 ng (the \u201cquota\u201d) of plasmid DNA with 2.25 uL Attractene tranfection reagent (Qiagen; Hilden Germany). 18 ng of each reporter minigene plasmid was transfected. The remaining quota was then divided equally among the effector and gRNA plasmids. In cases where there were two or more gRNA plasmids, the quota allocated for gRNA plasmids is further subdivided equally. For two-peptide effectors (i.e., the MS2 and the FKBP-FRB systems), the effector plasmid quota was divided equally between the plasmids encoding the individual peptides. Media was changed 24 hr after transfection. 100 nM (final concentration) of rapamycin was added during media change if applicable. Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection for RT-PCR analysis.",
