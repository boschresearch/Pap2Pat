    "date": "2016-04-05",
    "abstract": "Polymerases that synthesize artificial genetic polymers hold great promise for advancing future applications in synthetic biology. However, engineering natural polymerases to replicate unnatural genetic polymers is a challenging problem. Here we present droplet-based optical polymerase sorting (DrOPS) as a general strategy for expanding polymerase function that employs an optical sensor to monitor polymerase activity inside the microenvironment of a uniform synthetic compartment generated by microfluidics. We validated this approach by performing a complete cycle of encapsulation, sorting and recovery on a doped library and observed an enrichment of \u223c1,200-fold for a model engineered polymerase. We then applied our method to evolve a manganese-independent \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl nucleic acid (TNA) polymerase that functions with >99% template-copying fidelity. Based on our findings, we suggest that DrOPS is a versatile tool that could be used to evolve any polymerase function, where optical detection can be achieved by Watson-Crick base pairing.",

                        "Molecular beacons previously developed to monitor polymerase function suffer from a low SNR that precludes their use in w/o droplets2223. We therefore set out to design a polymerase activity assay (PAA) that would produce a strong optical signal when a primer\u2013template complex is extended to full-length product, but remain dim when the primer goes unextended (Fig. 1a). With this goal in mind, a DNA-quencher probe was designed to dissociate from the primer\u2013template complex at elevated temperatures where thermophilic polymerases function with optimal activity and re-anneal at room temperature when the sample is assayed for function (Fig. 1b). By coupling polymerase activity to fluorescence, genes encoding functional polymerases are identified by the optical signal of their droplet, while variants that fail to extend the primer remain dim and are removed from the pool during cell sorting.",
                        "Recent advances in the chemistry of dark quenchers caused us to speculate that a donor\u2013quencher pair could be identified with improved spectral properties24. By surveying a small number of fluorescent dyes, we found that Cy3 produces an optical signal that is 200-fold higher than its quenched state with Iowa Black FQ (Fig. 1c), which is substantially higher than previous donor\u2013quencher pairs developed to monitor polymerase activity22.",
                        "To test the Cy3-Iowa Black FQ donor\u2013quencher pair in a PAA, the RNA synthesis activity of an engineered DNA polymerase was compared with its wild-type (wt) DNA polymerase counterpart. For this experiment, we used 9n-GLK, which is an engineered version of a DNA polymerase isolated from Thermococcus sp. 9\u00b0 N that carries the mutations Y409G, A485L and E664K (ref. 25). Exonuclease-deficient versions of 9n-GLK and wt 9n were challenged to extend a DNA primer\u2013template complex with deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) and ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTP). Analysis of the primer-extension reactions by denaturing PAGE and fluorescence confirmed that full-length product is obtained in all cases except when the wt polymerase is incubated with NTPs (Fig. 1d). This result is consistent with the strong steric gate activity of natural DNA polymerases26. More importantly, however, the strong concordance observed between the PAGE and fluorescence-analysed data (Fig. 1d) demonstrates that the Cy3-Iowa Black FQ donor\u2013quencher produces an optical signal suitable for monitoring polymerases activity in a bulk aqueous environment."

                        "Next, we sought to miniaturize the PAA by encapsulating the primer\u2013template complex in uniform w/o droplets. We began by making w/o droplets in a flow-focusing, fluorocarbon-coated microfluidic device (Supplementary Fig. 1). In this system, droplet formation occurs at the flow-focusing junction where the aqueous phase meets a fluorous oil carrier phase. The droplets are stabilized by surfactants in the oil that prevent coalescence at elevated temperatures (as high as 90\u2009\u00b0C) and allow for long-term storage at room temperature.",
                        "To demonstrate that the PAA functions within the environment of a w/o droplet, strains of E. coli expressing the wt and 9n-GLK mutant polymerases were encapsulated with the reagents needed for RNA synthesis on a DNA primer\u2013template complex. Droplets were formed following a Poisson distribution (\u03bc=0.1) to ensure that 99% of the occupied droplets contain at most a single E. coli cell. This prediction was empirically validated using cells expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP; Supplementary Fig. 2). Once formed, the droplets were heated to promote E. coli lysis and incubated for 3\u2009h at 55\u2009\u00b0C to facilitate primer extension. Fluorescence and bright-field images were taken to assess polymerase activity in a population of w/o droplets. As shown in Fig. 1e, droplets containing the 9n-GLK E. coli strain produce a highly fluorescent signal due to the strong RNA synthesis activity of 9n-GLK, while empty droplets or droplets that contain the wild-type 9n E. coli strain remain dim. Taken together, these images demonstrate that the PAA functions with high activity in uniform w/o compartments, which is a necessary criterion for developing a microfluidics-based method for polymerase evolution."

This problem can be overcome by performing a second compartmentalization step in which w/o droplets are emulsified in water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double-emulsion droplets that have an aqueous carrier phase27. We therefore prepared a set of double-emulsion compartments using a hydrophilic microfluidics device that combines the w/o droplets with an aqueous carrier phase at the flow-focusing junction (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two populations of single-emulsion droplets containing either 9n-GLK or wt 9n DNA polymerase were converted to w/o/w droplets and analysed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1f). The population generated with E. coli cells expressing the wt 9n polymerase display uniformly low fluorescence, while droplets generated with E. coli cells expressing 9n-GLK have a bimodal distribution with low and high fluorescence. The fraction of highly fluorescent droplets correlates with the expected bacterial occupancy of \u223c10% as predicted by statistical analysis and the GFP encapsulation assay (Supplementary Fig. 2). Moreover, the difference in average fluorescence intensity between the two populations is >10-fold, which is sufficient to separate the two populations by FACS."

E. coli cells expressing the 9n wt polymerase were combined with 1/100th, 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th of one equivalent of E. coli cells expressing 9n-GLK as a positive control for RNA synthesis activity. The 9n-GLK plasmids were engineered to contain a unique NotI restriction site to distinguish 9n-GLK from wt 9n in a restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 2b). Accordingly, the three populations of E. coli were encapsulated in w/o droplets at an occupancy level of \u223c10%, which ensured that 99% of the occupied droplets contained no more than one E. coli per compartment. Following cell lysis and primer extension, the samples were passed through a second microfluidics device to generate three populations of w/o/w droplets that were each sorted by FACS (Supplementary Fig. 1). Plasmid DNA recovered from the different populations was amplified by PCR and digested with NotI restriction enzyme. Comparison of the digested DNA before and after sorting revealed an enrichment of \u223c1,200-fold of 9n-GLK (Fig. 2b,c), which is consistent with previous literature results where model libraries have been sorted in w/o/w double-emulsion droplets27."

For this experiment, we chose \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl nucleic acid (TNA)\u2014an unnatural genetic polymer composed of repeating units of \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl sugars linked by 2\u2032,3\u2032-phosphodiester bonds (Fig. 3a)28. TNA is an attractive candidate for therapeutic and diagnostic applications due to its stability against nuclease degradation and ability to undergo Darwinian evolution3. However, the current generation of TNA polymerases suffers from low fidelity due to a propensity for G\u2013G mispairing in the enzyme active site29.",
                        "We hypothesized that the low fidelity of TNA synthesis was due to the presence of manganese ions (Mn2+), which are used to relax the substrate specificity of natural polymerases30. We therefore designed an in vitro selection strategy to evolve a Mn2+-independent TNA polymerase in hopes of generating an enzyme that functions with higher fidelity. A polymerase library was constructed in which positions 409, 485 and 664 in the 9n DNA polymerase scaffold were fully saturated with all possible amino acid mutations. These positions were chosen based on their known propensity to alter the substrate specificity of natural polymerases31. The 8,000 member library was assembled from commercial gene blocks (Supplementary Fig. 4), cloned into E. coli and sequence verified. Because the sequencing results revealed a number of random mutations in the gene-coding region, including unwanted stop codons, a single round of selection was performed under standard DNA synthesis conditions to increase the proportion of active clones. SDS\u2013PAGE analysis of randomly selected clones before and after active polymerase enrichment revealed a dramatic increase in the number of full-length enzymes, indicating that neutral selection removed the truncated non-functional polymerases from the pool (Supplementary Fig. 5).",

Control experiments performed in the presence and absence of dNTP substrate confirmed that each polymerase was functional and free of cellular contaminants that could lead to a false positive result in the PAA (Supplementary Fig. 6).

A time course analysis comparing 9n-YRI and 9n-NVA with wt 9n (Fig. 3c) indicates that both engineered polymerases function as strong Mn2+-independent TNA polymerases, generating \u223c50% full-length product in 3\u2009h and 9\u2009h, respectively. By contrast, wt 9n shows very little full-length product after 18\u2009h of incubation under identical conditions (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 6), indicating that the selected mutations enable 9n DNA polymerase to synthesize TNA in the absence of manganese ions."

We therefore measured the fidelity of TNA synthesis by sequencing >2,000\u2009nucleotide positions isolated from the complementary DNA (cDNA) product generated after a complete cycle of TNA replication (DNA\u2192TNA\u2192DNA) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Unlike kinetic fidelity assays which examine a single-nucleotide insertion event34, DNA sequencing provides a more complete view of the replication cycle by identifying insertions, deletions and mutations that occur when genetic information is converted from DNA into TNA and then in a separate reaction from TNA back into DNA1.",
                        "A series of controls was used to ensure that the sequencing data reflected the accuracy of TNA \u2018transcription' and \u2018reverse transcription' in the primer-extension reactions. The first control was a PCR assay that tested for DNA contaminants in the TNA product isolated by PAGE purification (Supplementary Fig. 8). In no cases did we observe a PCR product that amplified with the same number of cycles as the cDNA strand isolated from the reverse transcription of a TNA template into DNA. The second control involved checking the sequencing product to ensure that a T to A mutation occurred in the primer-binding site. Our TNA synthesis reaction was performed with a primer that contained a single-nucleotide mismatch that would lead to a T to A mutation when the TNA strand was reverse transcribed into DNA but lacking in sequences that were amplified from DNA contaminants3 (Supplementary Table 2).",
                        "Analysis of the sequencing results indicates that a TNA replication cycle performed with 9n-YRI as the TNA polymerase and SuperScript II as the reverse transcriptase produces \u223c2 mistakes out of 1,000\u2009nucleotide incorporations when manganese ions are absent from the TNA synthesis reaction. By contrast, the mutation rate is \u223c50-fold higher when the same reaction was performed in the presence of manganese ions (Fig. 3d). This striking result confirms the hypothesis that manganese ions lower the fidelity of TNA synthesis and provide a viable strategy for faithful TNA synthesis under conditions that more closely approximate natural DNA synthesis. In this regard, 9n-YRI and 9n-NVA, represent the first demonstration of TNA polymerases that functions in the absence Mn2+ (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6b)."

                "Synthetic genetics aims to develop artificial genetic polymers that can replicate in vitro and eventually in model cellular organisms4. Achieving this ambitious goal will require major advances in chemical synthesis and polymerase engineering, as both fields of science are needed to develop the tools necessary for copying information back and forth between DNA and XNA and eventually between XNA polymers themselves. Recognizing that some of the most interesting XNAs can only be obtained by chemical synthesis7, researchers are facing a pressing need for new synthetic protocols that can be used to generate XNA monomers on the gram scale. Coupled with this effort is the equally challenging demand for new XNA polymerases that can synthesize kilobases of information with no mistakes. While this later goal may seem modest in comparison to natural polymerases, which can faithfully copy a megabase of DNA, the applications envisioned for XNA are less demanding than the biological requirements imposed by cellular organisms35.",
                "In the current study, we present DrOPS as a new strategy for engineering polymerases with non-natural functions. Our method relies on single and double-emulsion droplets that are produced using commercially available microfluidic chips and reagents. The two-chip design simplifies the procedure for generating monodisperse droplets and provides flexibility for controlling such parameters as droplet size and oil-layer thickness27. With this system, droplets can be produced and screened in a matter of hours, which allows a round of selection to take place in 3\u20134 days. For example, we screened a library of 36 million double-emulsion droplets in 2\u2009h (at 5\u2009kHz) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Based on this rate of sorting, we suggest that it should be possible to screen >108 droplets per day, which may be necessary for some polymerase functions that require greater library diversity.",
                "The DrOPS method has several advantages over existing polymerase engineering technologies. Relative to screening procedures that assay variants in microlitre-scale reactions, miniaturization of the PAA into microdroplets reduces the assay volume to the picolitre scale, which is a \u223c106-fold reduction in reaction volume per polymerase assay.",
                "This improvement in assay volume size coupled with the ability to sort >108 droplets per day leads to enormous cost savings for chemically synthesized substrates like tNTPs that require more than 12 synthetic steps to produce32. In the case of our 8,000 member library, we performed 1 round of DrOPS using 200\u2009\u03bcl of tNTP containing reaction buffer, which is equivalent to 20 primer-extension reactions performed under standard bulk-phase conditions. By comparison, traditional screening of the same library with 98% coverage would require 32,000 PAAs and consume >320\u2009ml of reaction buffer. This striking difference leads to an economy of scale that benefits microfluidics-based reactions by reducing the consumption of chemically synthesized substrates, which is critical to realizing the long-term of goals of synthetic genetics4.",
                "DrOPS also compares favourably with other polymerase technologies, like CSR and CST, that use w/o emulsions generated by bulk mixing112. While CSR and CST have been used to evolve polymerases with enhanced activity and expanded substrate recognition, both methods use the parent plasmid as template for the primer-extension reaction, which limits the range of polymerase functions to enzymes that promote DNA-templated synthesis. In addition, CST requires affinity purification on a solid-support matrix, which lowers the partitioning efficiency of functional members due to non-specific DNA binding to the resin. By contrast, DrOPS uses an optical sensor that is amenable to any nucleic acid polymer that is capable of Watson\u2013Crick base pairing and relies on solution-based separation methods, like FACS to separate functional droplets from the non-functional pool. In addition, the ability to specify the sequence composition and length of the template provides enormous control over the stringency of the selection. Together, these properties of template control and solution-based separation make DrOPS a versatile tool that could be applied to a wide range of problems in polymerase engineering.",
                "Although this study examined a specific problem in TNA polymerase engineering, namely, the ability to synthesize TNA in the absence of manganese ions, the DrOPS technology is unique in the sense that it could be applied to other more challenging problems in polymerase engineering. For example, the quantitative aspect of DrOPS could be used to identify new XNA polymerases with superior activity, while the template control aspect provides an avenue for discovering future polymerases that can copy XNA into DNA or possible even XNA into XNA, thereby demonstrating direct XNA replication.",
                "In summary, we have developed a microfluidics-based method for evolving novel polymerase functions in vitro. The strategy functions with high partitioning efficiency, using an optical sensor that could be engineered for other substrate\u2013template combinations. While further advances in optical detection and droplet separation are possible36, the ability to use commercial chips and reagents provides a technology that is readily available to most laboratories."
