                        "Over millions of years of evolution, many marine animals such as fish have developed skins capable of protecting them from marine fouling, which are accomplished by combining micro- and nanoscaled hierarchical structures and suitable surface chemistry. Meanwhile it has been also revealed that fish can survive in oil-polluted water owing to their oleophobic scales. Oil wettability is of great importance for materials used in aqueous or non-aqueous media, because of its application in fields such as droplet manipulation in microfluidics, fabrication of antifouling filtration membranes, and oil/water separation. In such way, an oil-water-solid system instead of the air-water-solid system becomes the main concern.",
                        "Therefore, the design and preparation of surfaces with controllable oil wettability is highly desirable, particularly those that exhibit switchable oleophobicity in aqueous media."

In some embodiments, a block copolymer comprising poly(2-vinyl pyridine) and polydimethylsiloxane segments (i.e., P2VP-b-PDMS) is then grafted onto the deposited silica nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the resulting surfaces of the modified membranes or other materials are hydrophobic at neutral pH and hydrophilic at acidic pH.

In other embodiments, they have not been impregnated with nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles are silica. In other embodiments, nanoparticles other than silica are also contemplated. For example, such other nanoparticles include carbon nanotubes, nanoclays, zeolites, iron oxides, silver nanoparticles, copper oxides, titanium dioxide, carbon black, etc.",

                        "Properties of Surface-Modified Membranes and Substrates",
                        "The surface-modified membranes and other materials provided herein exhibit a range of useful properties, and they may be used in a variety of applications, including oil spill cleanup, oil/water purification, etc. For example, surface-modified membranes and other materials that exhibit pH switchable wettability may be used to control underwater oil wettability of membranes other substrates and apparatuses. In some of the embodiments, the surface-modified membranes and other materials are oleophilic at neutral pH and oleophobic at acidic pH. As an example of an application, such a material, including a block polymer grafted textile fabric, may be used to provide controllable oil/water separation processes.",
                        "Wettability of a surface is typically governed by the surface chemistry as well as the surface roughness. In some embodiments, wettability is evaluated by contact angle measurements. The results discussed in the Example section confirm that P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textile exhibits tunable wetting behavior to water, depending on water pH, switching between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. The switchable water wettability of the surface is expected to affect its oil wettability in aqueous media. FIG. 5 presents the oil wettability of the P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textile under water of different pH values, with DCE representing an oil phase. On contact, the textile immediately sucked up the DCE droplets without leaving behind any residues. This simple experiment revealed that the block copolymer grafted membranes and substrates are promising sorbents for removing oil from water.",
                        "In some embodiments, the surface-modified membranes and other surface-modified materials provided herein are hydrophobic to water at pH\u22673, which means the surface is nonwettable in these aqueous media. As a result, when the surface-modified material is immersed in neutral water, the surface is still covered with the oleophilic PDMS chains, and therefore once an oil droplet contacts the surface, oil wets the surface preferentially over water, owing to the oleophilic surface property (FIG. 5c).",
                        "In some embodiments, air can be trapped inside the rough grooves of surface-modified membranes and substrates when submerged in water. The as-prepared block copolymer grafted textile surface is hydrophobic in air. A complex interfacial system, i.e., a four phase system (air-solid-oil-water), will then be formed when an oil droplet contacts such a surface.",
                        "In some embodiments, when the surface-modified membranes and substrates provided herein are immersed in acidic water, for example pH of 2.0, the oil wettability of the surface reversed completely. As has been discussed in greater detail below, the present invention provides surface-modified membranes and substrates that are hydrophilic in acidic water. Under such conditions, water can readily wet the surface and diffuse into micro- and nanostructures of the textile, forming a water trapped composite interface.",
                        "In some embodiments, e.g., after being rinsed with neutral water and dried, the acid-wetted surface can easily recover its hydrophobic and oleophilic properties in neutral aqueous medium, consistent with switchable oleophobicity and oleophilicity in aqueous media. In some embodiments, the surface properties may be switched reversibly without any significant change in the pH-responsive property of the surface (FIG. 6).",
                        "From the results presented in the examples section below, some of the surface-modified membranes and substrates provided herein, including P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textiles, exhibit switchable oleophobicity and oleophilicity in aqueous medium with different pH values. Such surface-modified membranes and substrates are expected to be very useful to membranes and substrates for underwater applications. For example, in some embodiments, it was shown that such surface-modified membranes and substrates can be used for the controllable water/oil separation (FIG. 7). The ease with which the permeability of the block copolymer grafted textile toward oil and water is selectively switched means the same piece of material can be used for different separation purposes.",
                        "Oil Spill Cleanup",
                        "In some embodiments, the membranes and substrates and methods disclosed herein may be used for the clean-up and/or remediation of oil or hydrocarbon spills and pollution.",
                        "An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, typically due to human activity. Often the term refers to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters. The oil may be a variety of materials, including crude oil, refined petroleum products, such as gasoline or diesel fuel, oily refuse or oil mixed in waste, or hydrocarbons generally. Oil may also enter the marine environment from natural oil seeps.",
                        "The environmental effects include damage to wildlife, water purity and coastal areas. For example, oil will coat the feathers of birds, thereby reducing their insulating ability and make the birds more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Oil also impairs bird flight abilities. As they attempt to preen, birds typically ingest oil that covers their feathers, causing kidney damage, altered liver function, and digestive tract irritation. This and the limited foraging ability quickly causes dehydration and metabolic imbalances. Many birds affected by an oil spill will die unless there is human intervention.",
                        "Other marine mammals are affected as well. For example, oil will coat the fur of sea otters and seals, reducing their insulation abilities and leading to body temperature fluctuations and hypothermia. Ingestion of the oil causes dehydration and impaired digestions. Beyond mammals, fish and invertebrates are also typically affected.",
                        "Plant and algae species may also be affected by an oil spill. For example, because oil floats on top of water, less sunlight penetrates into the water, limiting the photosynthesis of marine plants and phytoplankton.",
                        "By decreasing and disabling flora and fauna populations, part or all of a given coastal and/or marine ecosystem may be affected by an oil spill.",
                        "Recovering oil depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (in warmer waters, some oil may evaporate), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.",
                        "Both crude oil and natural gas are predominantly a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights, and other organic compounds, that are found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's surface. Under surface pressure and temperature conditions, the lighter hydrocarbons methane, ethane, propane and butane occur as gases, while the heavier ones from pentane and up are in the form of liquids or solids. However, in the underground oil reservoir the proportion which is gas or liquid varies depending on the subsurface conditions, and on the phase diagram of the petroleum mixture.",
                        "The majority of hydrocarbons found naturally occur in crude oil, where decomposed organic matter provides an abundance of carbon and hydrogen which, when bonded, can catenate to form seemingly limitless chains. Extracted hydrocarbons in a liquid form are referred to as petroleum or mineral oil. A hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes), alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes and alkyne-based compounds are different types of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons in crude oil are mostly alkanes, cycloalkanes and various aromatic hydrocarbons while the other organic compounds contain nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, and trace amounts of metals such as iron, nickel, copper and vanadium. The exact molecular composition varies widely from formation to formation.",
                        "Hydrocarbons are one of the Earth's most important energy resources. The predominant use of hydrocarbons is as a combustible fuel source. In their solid form, hydrocarbons take the form of asphalt. The C6 through C10 alkanes, alkenes and isomeric cycloalkanes are the top components of gasoline, naptha, jet fuel and specialized industrial solvent mixtures. With the progressive addition of carbon units, the simple non-ring structured hydrocarbons have higher viscosities, lubricating indices, boiling points, solidification temperatures, and deeper color.",
                        "The proportion of light hydrocarbons in the petroleum mixture is typically highly variable between different oil fields and ranges from as much as 97% by weight in the lighter oils to as little as 50% in the heavier oils and bitumens.",
                        "In one aspect, the invention provides membranes and substrates that may be used to reduce hydrocarbon pollution to an acceptable level. In some embodiments, the method removes greater than 90%, 95% or 98% of the hydrocarbon from the contaminated site, for example, from water or shoreline.",
                        "The methods, membranes and substrates and compositions provided herein may be combined with other cleanup methods, including bioremediation, use of accelerators, controlled burning, use of dispersants or detergents, skimming, use of booms, or use of vacuums.",
                        "Bioremediation involves the use of microorganisms or biological agents to break down or remove oil.",
                        "Accelerators are hydrophobic chemicals, containing no bacteria, which chemically and physically bond to both soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons. The accelerator acts as a herding agent in water and on the surface, floating molecules to the surface of the water to form gel-like agglomerations.",
                        "Controlled burning can effectively reduce the amount of oil in water.",
                        "Dispersants and detergents will typically clustering around oil globules and allowing them to be carried away in the water.",

To introduce the nanostructures on the surface of the textile fibers, silica nanoparticles were first coated on the textile fabric from a silica sol (20 mL 2% silica nanoparticles (7 nm), 0.5 mL concentrated HCl and 0.5 mL 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane). Then the silica nanoparticles deposited on the textile fabric were functionalized with (3-bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane (BPS), which served as the anchoring layer. Finally, the block copolymer of P2VP-b-PDMS was grafted onto the surface through the quaternization reaction between the bromoalkyl groups and the pyridyl groups of the block copolymers. Scanning electrical microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out to characterize the surface morphologies of the textile surface before and after the functionalization. As shown in FIGS. 2a & b, the raw textile fabric typically consists of ribbon-like fibers with sizes of about 40 \u03bcm in width and 5 \u03bcm in thickness and the fibers exhibit relatively smooth surfaces. After the silica nanoparticle deposition and the block copolymer grafting, the textile fibers were not changed (FIG. 2c), while clusters of several micrometers could be observed. Enlarged view in FIG. 2d reveals that the surface of the fibers was randomly distributed with nanostructures and microscale clusters which are composed of aggregated nanostructures. These deposited nanostructures and the clusters, along with the underneath inherent microscale fibers, constituted a hierarchically micro- and nanoscale surface roughness, which is believed to amplify the surface wetting properties."

For the as-prepared block copolymer grafted textile surface in air, the neutral (pH \u02dc6.5) water droplet formed a sphere with a contact angle of 157.2\u00b14.2\u00b0, as shown in the left panel of FIG. 3a, indicating a hydrophobic surface for neutral water. After 15 min of exposure to ambient air, the water droplet remained its spherical form in spite of shrinkage due to the evaporation induced total volume reduction indicating that the as-prepared surface is stable to neutral water. Moreover, as the raw untreated textile fabric exhibits a hydrophilic surface property, the hydrophobicity of the as-prepared surface demonstrates a successful grafting of the block copolymer, which lowers the surface energy of the surface. The oil wettability of the as-prepared surface in air was also tested by using 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) droplet as an indicator. As shown in FIG. 3b, as soon as the oil droplet contacted the surface of the textile, it completely spread over the surface within 50 ms, indicating the oleophilicity of the as-prepared surface.",
                                "P2VP, a weak polybase (pKa\u02dc4.7), exhibits pH-dependent wettability, being hydrophobic at high pHs but hydrophilic at low pHs, owing to protonation and deprotonation processes of pyridyl groups. As shown in FIG. 4a, when an acidic water droplet (pH 1.0) was applied on the P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textile fabric surface in air, it gradually spread out completely within about 10 seconds and wetted the textile, indicating the hydrophilicity of the surface to acidic water. The acid-exposed surface can recover its hydrophobicity easily by rinsing with neutral water and then drying with N2 flow and this process can be quickly finished at room temperature within 2 minutes and does not involve the use of extreme heating temperature or solvent treatment. This is mainly because that the PDMS segment in the block copolymer has a low glass transition temperature (Tg, ca. \u221262\u00b0 C. according to the supplier) and thus it owns a high flexibility and thus can be considered as a liquid polymer at ambient temperature. Therefore, and without being bound by theory, it is expected that, upon drying, the PDMS segments, which are more hydrophobic than the P2VP segments, spontaneously stretch and move to the exterior of the grafted block copolymer, which recovers the hydrophobicity of the prepared surface. FIGS. 4b & c present wetting behaviors of water droplets with different pHs on the block copolymer grafted textile. It is observed that the block copolymer grafted textile could be fully wetted by water with pH=2.0 within 160 seconds, but is stably hydrophobic to water of pH\u22673.0. Clearly, the water droplet with pH 1 wets the prepared surface much faster than that with pH 2. A clear-cut, abrupt switch of surface water wettability within a small pH range makes this material desirable for many applications.",
                                "These results confirm that P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textile exhibits tunable wetting behavior to water, depending on water pH, switching between hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. The switchable water wettability of the surface is expected to affect its oil wettability in aqueous media. FIG. 5 presents the oil wettability of the P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textile under water of different pH values, with DCE representing an oil phase. As shown in FIG. 5a, as soon as the DCE droplet touched the surface of the block copolymer grafted textile, which was immersed in water of pH 6.5, it immediately diffused into the textile within 0.12 s, indicating a oleophilic property of the surface in pH neutral aqueous medium. FIG. 5b shows an underwater oil uptake process by the block copolymer grafted textile. The oil red stained DCE droplets were dropped at the bottom of the beaker containing water of pH 6.5, and then a piece of the block copolymer grafted textile was lowered down to approach the DCE droplets. On contact, the textile immediately sucked up the DCE droplets without leaving behind any residues. This simple experiment reveals that the block copolymer grafted materials are promising sorbents for removing oil from water.",
                                "As discussed above, the surface prepared by the method described above is hydrophobic to water at pH\u22673, which means the surface is nonwettable in these aqueous media. As a result, when the block copolymer grafted textile is immersed in neutral water, the surface is still covered with the oleophilic PDMS chains, and therefore once an oil droplet contacts the surface, oil wets the surface preferentially over water owing to the oleophilic surface property (FIG. 5c). Additionally, it was found that the surface was still oleophilic even after 24 h of immersion in water of pH 6.5, which demonstrates that the oleophilic property of the prepared surface is relatively stable under pH neutral aqueous media.",
                                "On the other hand, it has been reported that air can be trapped inside the rough grooves of the hydrophobic surface under water. The as-prepared block copolymer grafted textile surface is hydrophobic in air. In some embodiments, air will be trapped inside the grooves when the rough surface is immersed in water. A complex interfacial system, i.e., a four phase system (air-solid-oil-water), will then be formed when an oil droplet contacts such a surface.",
                                "In contrast to neutral water, when the textile was immersed in acidic water with pH of 2.0, the oil wettability of the surface reversed completely. As shown in FIG. 5d, the DCE contact angle was 165.3\u00b0 in the acidic water, indicating the oleophobicity of the block copolymer grafted textile in acidic water. FIG. 5d shows a photograph of DCE droplets sitting on the surface of the textile under acidic water, and clearly the textile was non-wettable to oil. As has been discussed above, the block copolymer grafted surface can be turned into hydrophilic due to the protonation of pyridyl groups in acidic water, and thus when immersed in acidic water, water can easily wet the surface and diffuse into micro- and nanostructures of the textile, forming a water trapped composite interface. In some embodiments, this new composite interface contributes to the oleophobic property of the surface under water (FIG. 5f).",
                                "After being rinsed with neutral water and dried with N2 flow, the acid-wetted surface can easily recover its hydrophobic and oleophilic properties in neutral aqueous medium, thus suggesting its switchable oleophobicity and oleophilicity in aqueous media. It turns out that the reversible cycle of the surface wettability (both in air and aqueous media) can be repeated for many times without any change in the pH-responsive property of the surface (FIG. 6).",

According to this equation, it can be seen that the contact angle of oil in water can be adjusted by tuning the \u03b8oa, and \u03b8wa. Taking DCE as an example, its interfacial tension with air (\u03b3oa) is 24.15 mNm\u22121, and the water surface tension (\u03b3wa) is 73.0 mNm\u22121. The DCE/water interfacial tension (\u03b3ow) is 28.1 mNm\u22121. In air the DCE contact angle on the block copolymer grafted smooth surface (\u03b8oa) was 13.5\u00b0. However, for water with different pH values, the contact angle in air can be changed from 91.2\u00b0 (pH 6.5) to 52.1\u00b0 (pH 2.0), due to the pH-tunable wettability of P2VP chains. As a result from equation (1), the oil contact angle in these aqueous media are 27\u00b0 (pH 6.5) and 139.5\u00b0 (pH 2.0), indicating the switching of the wettability from oleophilicity to oleophobicity. The calculated results are consistent with the experimental results where the flat surface (i.e., silicon wafer) with the grafted block copolymer showed oil contact angles of ca. 36\u00b0 in water of pH 6.5 and 138\u00b0 in water of pH 2.0, respectively. As for the grafted block copolymer grafted textiles, their hierarchical micro- and nanostructures further amplified their oil wettability making them oleophilic and oleophobic surfaces in different aqueous media.",

The P2VP-b-PDMS grafted textiles were fixed between two glass tubes as a separation membrane. The simple oil/water separation setup is shown in FIG. 7. A mixture of commercial gasoline and pH neutral water was poured into the upper glass tube, and, due to the oleophilicity and hydrophobicity of the textile surface, only gasoline quickly passed through the textile and water could not and thus was retained on top of the textile in the upper glass tube (FIG. 7a). However, when the textile was first simply wetted by an acidic water (pH<2) (without drying) and then used under otherwise same conditions, an inversed water/oil separation process was realized. As shown in FIG. 7b, in this case, water, which is neutral pH, in the mixture selectively passed through the textile quickly, leaving behind the gasoline retained in the upper tube. The ease with which the permeability of the block copolymer grafted textile toward oil and water is selectively switched means the same piece of material can be used for different separation purposes."

The modified foams exhibit oleophilicity in neutral aqueous medium, and can be easily switched into oleophobic when wetted by acidic water. FIGS. 8a & b shows the oil capture and release process by the functionalized foam. DCE of about 2 mL stained with oil red dye was dropped into neutral water, and a functionalized foam was held to approach the DCE phase in water, and upon contact, the DCE was quickly sucked up by the foam without any residues left behind (FIG. 8a & b). Moreover, the absorbed oil can be easily released from the foam when the oil-loaded foam was transferred into an acidic water (pH 2.0) with gentle shaking and squeezing (FIG. 8c), which is caused by the switching of the surface wettability from oleophobicity to oleophilicity. After washing with neutral water and drying, the foam can recover its oleophilic property and can be used for oil removal again. Thus, the material is recyclable, reducing oil cleanup cost significantly."

The liquid marbles were prepared by encapsulating water droplets with the responsive functionalized nanoparticles (FIG. 9c). The such-prepared liquid marbles have a pH-responsive rupture behavior (FIG. 9c). The mesoporous shell of the functionalized nanoparticles were further loaded with photo-acid generator (PAG) (FIG. 9d). The liquid marble prepared using the PAG-loaded functionalized nanoparticles rupture under UV illumination (FIG. 9d), avoiding the requirement of adjusting the bulk pH of the system. Due to the magnetic core materials of the functionalized nanoparticles, the thus-prepared liquid marbles can be remotely manipulated by an external magnetic field (FIG. 9c). We envision that the potential applications of such remotely controllable liquid marbles based on the surface-modified nanostructures will include smart delivery of water-soluble agents to initiate chemical reactions on demand, channel-free microfluidic systems, and sensors with visual indication capability.",
