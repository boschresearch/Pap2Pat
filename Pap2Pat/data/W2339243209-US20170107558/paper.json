    "abstract": "Reliable clot diagnostic systems are needed for directing treatment in a broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases and coagulopathy. Here, we report on non-contact measurement of elastic modulus for dynamic and quantitative assessment of whole blood coagulation using acoustic radiation force orthogonal excitation optical coherence elastography (ARFOE-OCE). In this system, acoustic radiation force (ARF) is produced by a remote ultrasonic transducer and a shear wave induced by ARF excitation is detected by the optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. During porcine whole blood coagulation, changes in the elastic property of the clots increase the shear modulus of the sample, altering the propagating velocity of the shear wave. Consequently, dynamic blood coagulation status can be measured quantitatively by relating the velocity of the shear wave with clinically relevant coagulation metrics, including reaction time, clot formation kinetics and maximum shear modulus. The results show that the ARFOE-OCE is sensitive to the clot formation kinetics and can differentiate the elastic properties of the recalcified porcine whole blood, blood added with kaolin as an activator and blood spiked with fibrinogen.",

                "First, we investigate the feasibility of the ARFOE-OCE for measuring the shear modulus in the clotting blood. Time-course coagulation of the citrated porcine whole blood is investigated. Figure 1a shows the OCT image in a B-mode at 3\u2009min following the recalcification of blood coagulation. For the shear wave detection, 43\u2009M-scans are captured at the position indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 1a using each of three ARF excitation positions with a spacing of 1\u2009mm. Figure 1b and Supplementary Videos 1,2\u20133 shows the Doppler variance images at different points successively using three ARF focus positions. At 3\u2009min, no obvious vibration is detected; thus, no shear wave propagates to the OCT imaging area. After 8\u2009min, the transverse vibration of the blood sample is detectable, which is generated by a shear wave propagating from the ARF focus. In the process of blood coagulation, the wave occurrence time becomes shorter, indicating a faster shear wave velocity using each of the ARF focus positions.",
                "We determine the reaction time by detecting the vibration occurrence after the Doppler variance value is 0.025\u2009a.u. larger than the background for the detected peak. The measured occurrence time of the shear wave is shown in Fig. 2a. When the ARF focus is move downward at a spacing of 1\u2009mm (that is, the ARF focus is moved away from the wave detection point), the wave occurrence time is delayed. The average shear wave velocity can be calculated by the distance of two ARF focus positions and the time difference of wave occurrence. The calculated shear wave velocities during 60\u2009min are shown in Fig. 2b, which are measured by the application of the upper ARF focus and lower ARF focus. The density of the porcine blood clot changes slightly during the measurement so an average density \u03c1 of 1060\u2009kg/m3 is used in Eq. 1. The shear moduli during porcine whole blood coagulation are calculated by Eq. 1, as shown in Fig. 2c. The shear modulus increases rapidly during the early stage of blood coagulation and gradually reaches a plateau after 30\u2009min. The shear modulus of the clotted blood at 46\u2009min is 1.20\u2009kPa from Fig. 2c, which is close to the value 1.39\u2009kPa measured by the MTS Synergie 100 mechanical test. Figure 2d reveals a relation between the shear wave velocity V and the occurrence time  of the shear wave at the wave detection point with the lower ARF focus excitation, which can also be described by the following equation:",
                "",
                "where D is the distance between the wave detection point and the ARF focus, and T0 is the occurrence time of the shear wave at the ARF focus. The fitting of the data in Fig. 2d using Eq. 2 reveals the distance D and the occurrence time T0; thus, the shear wave velocity can also be calculated by occurrence time  of the shear wave using Eq. 2.",
                "In order to quantitatively characterize the elastic changes during blood coagulation, we developed coagulation metrics including reaction time describing the earliest time when the shear wave is detectable, clot formation kinetics describing the clot formation rate, and maximum shear modulus describing the maximum clot firmness. According to a previous study on elastic dynamics7, the change of the elastic modulus during blood coagulation can be modeled approximately by the logistic function, which is described by the following equation:",
                "",
                "where  is the maximum shear modulus,  is the time since initiation of coagulation,  is the clot formation kinetics describing the clot formation rate, and  is time at the sigmoid\u2019s midpoint.",
                "Once blood starts to clot, fibrin strands are formed, progressively increasing the firmness of the blood. Figure 2c is presented as an elastic property tracing of clot formation, providing the information on clot formation kinetics and strength. Three distinct stages of the sample can be identified during coagulation. During the first stage, the blood is in a liquid state: there are no shear waves detectable. During the second stage, the blood progressively turns into a gel state because of the transformation of fibrinogen into fibrin through a coagulation cascade reaction. In this stage, the propagation velocity of the shear wave and, thus, the shear modulus, increases markedly with increasing firmness. In the third stage, the propagation velocity of the shear wave and, thus, the shear modulus, changes to a small extent with an approximate horizontal asymptote, corresponding to the stability and maximum firmness of the clot. Therefore, reaction time is defined as the time from the start of a sample run until the first detectable level of the shear wave in the Doppler variance image, similar to PT and aPTT34. Clot formation kinetics  is defined as the clot formation rate and determined by Eq. 3 from the point of clot initiation to the peak strength of the clot. Maximum shear modulus represents the maximum clot firmness. This study demonstrates that the ARFOE-OCE is a feasible method for quantitatively analyzing the dynamic coagulation progress and status of whole blood.",
                "When thromboelastometry assay is performed, kaolin may be used as the factor XII (FXII) activator in order to facilitate the clot formation34. Therefore, the capability of ARFOE-OCE for characterizing the different coagulation process activated by kaolin is evaluated and shown in Fig. 3. A saline solution is added to citrated porcine whole blood without kaolin as the control group (n\u2009=\u20093) and with kaolin as the treatment group (n\u2009=\u20093). There is a significant difference between the two groups of blood samples in the reaction time, and the presence of kaolin results in an earlier reaction time. The values of reaction time, clot formation kinetics and maximum shear modulus for two groups of blood samples are presented in Table 1. The presence of kaolin significantly influences the reaction time (P\u2009<\u20090.01) but not the clot formation rate (P\u2009>\u20090.05) or the peak firmness of clot (P\u2009>\u20090.05).",
                "The capability of ARFOE-OCE for characterizing the different coagulation process spiked by fibrinogen is evaluated and shown in Fig. 4. The tests are performed using porcine whole blood without fibrinogen (n\u2009=\u20093) and porcine whole blood spiked with fibrinogen (n\u2009=\u20093). The addition of fibrinogen does not significantly affect the reaction time (P\u2009>\u20090.05) but significant differences are observed between the control group and blood samples with additional 4\u2009g/L fibrinogen in the clot formation kinetics (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and maximum shear modulus (P\u2009<\u20090.01), respectively. The values of reaction time, clot formation kinetics and maximum shear modulus for two groups of blood samples are presented in Table 2. The presence of additional fibrinogen significantly changes the clot formation rate and increases the peak firmness of clot.",
                "To verify the method, we perform kaolin activating and fibrinogen spiking experiments by continuously recording the shear modulus during clot formation. The reaction time is significantly shortened after intrinsic activation with Kaolin, similar to the results from thromboelastometry measurement4. Great changes in clot formation rate and clot firmness are evident after addition of fibrinogen. The results are in agreement with the measurement by thromboelastometry16. Similar to the thromboelastometry measurement, the changes in maximum shear modulus measured by ARFOE-OCE should not be considered as a measurement of fibrinogen concentration, but a measurement of mechanical properties of the fibrin clot."

                "The novel approach described here represents the first elastic coagulation test method capable of measuring whole blood coagulation metrics, such as reaction time, clot formation kinetics, and maximum shear modulus, by measuring the propagation velocity of the shear wave. The foundation of our approach is our new ARFOE-OCE incorporating the Doppler variance method capable of high-speed and high-sensitivity functional imaging: thus producing non-contact and rapid measurements of blood coagulation in real-time without subsequent calibration. We have tested three samples for each group in this study. Although large sample size test may be required for the clinical validation, our results have demonstrated the capability of this method for the measurement of the whole blood coagulation metrics.",
                "Using our method, the clot development can be visually displayed in real-time as the shear wave propagates, and the blood clot elasticity can be simply and accurately measured. Blood clot elasticity is a potentially powerful metric for predicting the risk associated with the presence of blood clots. Abnormal clot elasticity is associated with myocardial infarction, coronary atherothrombosis, ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and diabetes. The importance of clot elastic modulus is evidenced by the growing use of thromboelastometry devices34. The coagulation metrics developed by our method are similar to TEGR measurement, i.e., the time until initial fibrin formation (TEGR, reaction time; ROTEMR, clotting time), the kinetics of fibrin formation and clot development (TEGR, kinetics and \u03b1 angle; ROTEMR, clot formation time and \u03b1 angle), and the ultimate strength and stability of the fibrin clot (TEGR, maximum amplitude; ROTEMR, maximum clot firmness)34. More than 3000 publications are related to the use of thromboelastometry, in both research and clinical/perioperative settings. However, thromboelastometry devices generate output by transducing changes in the viscoelastic strength of clotting blood to which a constant rotational force is applied. The rotation of the pin of TEGR/ROTEMR begins to be impaired after fibrin-platelet bonding has linked the cup and pin together. Thus, the output is directly related to the strength of the formed clot. Unlike thromboelastometry techniques, the output of ARFOE-OCE is sensitive to elasticity and monitors elasticity changes that occur during initiation of coagulation and clot development. Therefore, the approach has the advantage of being an OCE Doppler variance method that has the potential for high accuracy. The high sensitivity of the OCT system provides typically microstrain sensitivity. Thus, our approach may overcome several limitations of both routine coagulation tests and thromboelastometry measurement.",
                "Because of the noninvasive nature, this technology also has the potential to perform in vivo imaging. This technology will have significant impacts in clinical researches, disease diagnoses and treatment management for bleeding patients in a variety of clinical situations, assessment of hypo- and hyper-coagulable states, and monitoring of pharmacological treatment with anti- and procoagulant drugs."

For ARF generation, an ultrasonic transducer with a resonant frequency of 4.5\u2009MHz is driven by the amplified sine wave at 160\u2009V peak-to-peak. The blood is filled to a box with a window of plastic wrap for the ultrasound wave passing. The box and the transducer are immersed in water for impedance matching of the ultrasound wave into the blood sample. The OCT system is based on a swept source with a central wavelength of 1310\u2009nm and an A-line speed of 50\u2009kHz. The light from the laser source is split into the sample arm and the reference arm with a power of 90% and 10%, respectively. For shear wave detection, 1000\u2009A-lines at a rate of 50\u2009kHz, corresponding to total time of 20.0\u2009ms, are involved in one OCT M-scan, and the ARF excitation is applied between the 101st A-line to the 150th A-line corresponding to 1.0\u2009ms emission. In this system, the ARF-induced vibration is perpendicular to the OCT beam, and the shear wave propagates along the OCT beam. Only the container contacts with the blood sample. The acoustic excitation system and optical detection system will not contact the blood sample."

As whole blood is a highly scattering media and the OCT penetration depth is shallow in blood17, it is difficult to visualize the shear wave propagation from the ARF focus to the sample surface. We use an alternative method to calculate the shear wave velocity, which is to measure the time delay of the shear wave propagating to the same depth after moving the ARF focus downwards to a known step by a mechanical lifting stage."
