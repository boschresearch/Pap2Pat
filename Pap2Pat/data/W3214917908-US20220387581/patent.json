    "abstract": "Plants and plant produced compositions which include Coronavirus S proteins are disclosed. These may be used as vaccines, boosters or immune modulators. The compositions have been shown to reduce the inflammatory cytokine response by altering cytokine levels when administered to an animal. The compositions may be used as an immune modulator to reduce/ameliorate or prevent the cytokine storm often associated with Coronavirus or other virus infection. The compositions may also be used to produce additive protection when administered with any vaccine composition to increase vaccine effectiveness. The compositions when used as vaccines have been shown to protect newborn animals through passive immunity.",

                        "Coronaviruses have become a major problem for both human and animal welfare and are a continuing threat in the near future. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) is a positive strand enveloped RNA virus of family Coronaviridae with a genome of 28 kb PEDV. The virus infects swine resulting in major losses to the industry in the US and worldwide (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017). Newborn piglets are especially susceptible with a high mortality rate. The disease was first identified in Europe in the early 1970s, in Asia in 2010, and in the United States in 2013. It continues to be a major problem in the swine industry.",
                        "PEDV causes severe diarrhea and mortality in piglets. Vaccines have the potential to provide a robust immunity and break the transmission cycle and while there have been promising results, none have provided complete protection from the virus. The spike protein (S) is the target for most vaccine strategies for coronavirus as it contains the majority of epitopes for neutralizing antibodies. In the case of PEDV, nursing piglets are in most need of protection, but they cannot mount their own immune response in time and must rely on passive immunity.",
                        "Vaccines based on the market from sources such as Harris vaccines and Zoetis, but are only marginally effective and are largely based on classical strains such as CV777 (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017). There is a clear need for a low-cost and more effective vaccine for PEDV."

                        "Applicants have discovered benefits of coronavirus vaccines, booster compositions or immune modulating compositions comprising coronavirus spike protein (S protein) produced from plants. Plant produced or plant based vaccines, booster compositions or immune modulating from Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) are demonstrated herein to provide passive immunity to newborn animals from mothers vaccinated and also to alter cytokine levels making the vaccine more effective which may be used as a booster for any vaccine. Briefly for production of the vaccine a construct is introduced into a plant comprising a promoter preferentially directing expression to seed of the plant, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a Spike polypeptide of PEDV and a nucleic acid molecule targeting expression to the endoplasmic reticulum. Embodiments provide the construct with a sequence of S protein including the COE polypeptide, a sequence encoding the LTB heat labile polypeptide or a combination thereof. Expression levels of at least 10 mg/kg of seed of the plant are obtained. When the plant or plant product is orally administered to the animal, a protective response is observed, including a serum antibody response. Further benefits include altered cytokine levels to reduce nonspecific immune reactions and passive immunity.",
                        "Applicants administered the S antigen to na\u00efve sows and gilts which were then boosted prior to farrowing. The newborn pigs were then challenged with PEDV and evaluated for disease symptoms. Nursing piglets from dams having had the oral vaccine candidate showed significantly higher survival rates than controls. In addition, dams were tested for correlates of protection. Milk and sera neutralizing antibodies (NABs) showed a significant correlation. The levels of thirteen different cytokines were also measured in dams and found in most cases to have reduced levels when administered with the S antigen compared to control dams. For INF, the cytokine level was increased which is desirable for reducing the non-specific immune response. This demonstrates that the S antigen from coronavirus may act not only as an immunogen to elicit (NABs) but may also act as an immune modulator to decrease cytokine levels and reducing the inflammatory response prior to viral exposure leading to reduction in disease severity Thus, the S protein and compositions containing the same may be used as an immune modulator to reduce/ameliorate or prevent the cytokine storm often associated with Coronavirus or other virus infection. The compositions may also be used to produce additive protection when administered with any vaccine composition to increase vaccine effectiveness. The effects are seen upon oral or injection administration and in some embodiments may be used as an oral accompaniment to an injected vaccine or in a completely oral vaccine protocol.",
                        "In a further embodiment the cytokine levels which are increased post exposure to Coronavirus may be used as a marker to indicate the presence of immunity or as a diagnostic for exposure to the same."

Although PEDV and TGEV viruses are related and the clinical signs are very similar, there is no immune cross-protection.",
                        "PEDV is an enveloped virus possessing approximately a 28 kb, positive-sense, single stranded RNA genome, with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. (Pensaert and De Bouck P. 1978). The genome comprises a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)) and three non-structural proteins (replicases 1a and 1b and ORF3); these are arranged on the genome in the order 5\u2032-replicase (1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u2032 (Oldham J. 1972; and Bridgen et al. 1993). The first three emergent North American PEDV genomic sequences characterized, Minnesota MN (GenBank: KF468752.1), Iowa IA1 (GenBank: KF468753.1), and Iowa IA2 (GenBank: KF468754.1), have the same size of 28,038 nucleotides (nt), excluding the polyadenosine tail and share the genome organization with the prototype PEDV CV777 strain (GenBank: AF353511.1). These three North American PEDV sequences shared 99.8 to 99.9% nucleotide identities. In particular, strains MN and IA2 had only 11 nucleotide differences across the entire genome.",
                        "The PEDV Spike (S) protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of about 1,383 amino acids (aa) (1386 with the Korea strain, see e.g., GenBank Ref NO. AAM19716.1 (SEQ ID NO: 22), identifying the S1 region as residues 234-736; 1382 amino acids in a China strain, with S1 identified as 230-732, see GenBank Ref No. AFL02627.1 (SEQ ID NO: 23)). It contains a putative signal peptide (residues 1-24). The S protein can be divided into two regions. One is the N-terminal region of S1 (1-733 or 735 aa). Referring to the Spike protein used in the example below, it has 94% identity to Korean strain example of AAM19716.1 and 93% identity with the China strain example of AFL02627.1. The other region is the C-terminal region S2 which is identified as including residues 736-741 to the end of the Spike protein based on its homology with S protein of other coronaviruses (Chang et al. 2002 Identification of the epitope region capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Mol. Cells 14, 295-299. Cleavage of the spike protein into S1 and S2 can occur in the presence of trypsin. (See e.g., Wicht et al. (2014) Proteolytic activation of the porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus spike fusion protein by trypsin in cell culture. J. Virol. 88:2952-7961). The GPRLQPY motif located at the carboxy-terminal of the spike protein induces antibodies that neutralize Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Godet et al. 1994Virus Res. 132, 192-196. Major receptor-binding and neutralization determinants are located within the same domain of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (coronavirus) spike protein. J. Virol. 68, 8008-8016; Jackwood et al. 2001. Spike glycoprotein cleavage recognition site analysis of infectious bronchitis virus.

The S protein in coronaviruses is a surface antigen, where it plays a role in regulating interactions with host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry and stimulating induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host. A phylogenetic and genetic comparison analysis of the S gene and its regions showed minor variations among strains, including the US, China, Korea, showed a percent identity ranging from 89.4% to 100% identity. This included percent identity of comparison of strains DR13, BM1, J3142, BM3, CV777, AH2012, BJ-2012-2, Colorado30, Indiana34 and Texas 31. See Chung et al (2017) Genetic characterization of S1 domain of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses spike proteins isolated in Korea, J. Immune Disord. Vol. 1 No. 1. Sequence comparisons of the polypeptide of the S protein showed Korean isolates had 93.6% to 99.6% identity with each other and 92.2%-93.7% identity with other strains. Lee et al. (2010) Hetergeneity in spike protein genes of porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses isolate din Kore, Virus Res. 149(2):175-82. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV.",
                        "The PEDV M protein is the most abundant envelope component playing an important role in the viral assembly process and also induces antibodies that neutralize the virus. Likewise, the PEDV N protein, which binds to virion RNA providing a structural basis for the nucleocapsid, may also be important for induction of cell-mediated immunity (Saif, L. 1993 Coronavirus immunogens. Vet. Microbiol. 285-297.).",
                        "The only accessory gene in PEDV is ORF3. While accessory genes are generally maintained in field strains, alteration of ORF3 is thought to influence virulence; cell culture adaptation has been used to alter the ORF3 gene in order to reduce virulence (Song et al. 2003 Differentiation of a Vero cell adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea virus from Korean field strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of ORF 3. Vaccine 21, 1833-1842). In fact, through investigation of the ORF3 gene, researchers have charted the emergence of new genogroups of PEDV in immunized swine herds in China since 2006. Phylogenic studies of these strains and the geographical reemergence of PEDV in China have demonstrated that those field strains causing devastating enteric disease differ genetically in ORF3 from the European strains and vaccine strains (Park et al. 2011) Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field isolates in Korea. Arch. Virol. 156, 577-585.",
                        "Different strains of PEDV exist with varying levels of virulence. The clinical signs of PEDV infection are similar to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection (Pijpers et al. 1993). In pigs three weeks of age and younger, clinical signs (including acute watery, diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration) can be seen as soon as 24 hours after PEDV infection leading to 100% mortality. PEDV-infected feeder and grower pigs, as well as sows and boars, can develop diarrhea and vomiting. The animals can also show signs of anorexia and can be lethargic. Older pigs show reduced feed efficiency, additional days to market, and the susceptibility of infected animals to secondary infections is likely. For sows, reduced body condition may negatively impact reproductive performance.",
                        "The gross and histological changes in the gut of animals infected with PEDV are similar in the United States as those observed in China; essentially the virus destroys the villi of a pig's intestine so that there is a failure to absorb nutrients. Animals succumbing to the disease in the Minnesota and Iowa outbreaks had gross pathological lesions confined to the small intestine and that the small intestine was characterized by thin translucent walls distended with yellow fluid. Histological evaluations revealed regions of small intestines with villus blunting and fusion and minimal lymphoblastic infiltration of the villi of the lamia propria.",
                        "Huang et al. 2013 characterized three different strains of PEDV from outgoing outbreaks in the United States\u2014one from Minnesota and two from Iowa, designated MN (GenBank accession No: KF468752) and IA1 (GenBank accession No: KF468753) and IA2 (GenBank accession No: KF48754), respectively. (Huang et al. 2013 Origin, evolution, and genotyping of emergent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains in the United States. mBio 4(5):e00737-13.) Huang's phylogenic survey grouped PEDV strains as falling into two distinct genogroups, designated genogroup 1 (G1) and genogroup 2 (G2). Genogroup 1 includes at least three clusters 1a, 1b, and R. Subgroup 1a includes the early European, Chinese, and Korean isolates, e.g., prototype CV777 strain (Belgium, 1978, GenBank: AF353511.1) and strains LZC (Gansu, China, 2006; GenBank: EF185992) and SM98 (Korea, 1998; GenBank: GU937797.1). Subgroup 1b contains five strains\u2014one from South Korea (the DR13 attenuated vaccine strain, GenBank: JQ023162.1) and the others from China linked by the common \u201cgenetic signature\u201d 8-aa deletion in nsp3 and the large ORF3 deletion at the C terminus. Group \u201cR\u201d is associated with recombinants of the other genogroups. Certain strains belong to genogroup G2a. The Chinese strain AH2012 (GenBank accession no: KC210145) and the North American strains share several unique nucleotides changes and are clustered together in genogroup 2a. Nucleotide identity to AH2012 for strains MN and IA2 was 99.6% and for strain IA1 was 99.5%. A closely related North American isolate US/Colorado/2013 (GenBank Accession No: KF272920.1) has also been reported by Marthaler et al, 2013 Complete genome sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain USA/Colorado/2013 from the United States. Genome Announc. 1(4):e00555-13.10.1128/genomeA.00555-13. Like the North American isolates above, the complete PEDV genome of CO/13 has a nucleotide identity of 96.5 to 99.5% with other complete PEDV genomes available in GenBank, with the highest nucleotide identity (99.5%) with Chinese strain AH2012 (GenBank Accession No. KC210145). It is a member of the 2a genogroup.",

Most coronaviruses have a common genome organization with the replicase gene included in the 5\u2032-portion of the genome, and structural genes included in the 3\u2032-portion of the genome. Coronavirus Spike (S) protein is class I fusion glycoprotein initially synthesized as a precursor protein. Individual precursor S polypeptides form a homotrimer and undergo glycosylation within the Golgi apparatus as well as processing to remove the signal peptide, and cleavage by a cellular protease to generate separate S1 and S2 polypeptide chains, which remain associated as S1/S2 protomers within the homotrimer and is therefore a trimer of heterodimers. The S1 subunit is distal to the virus membrane and contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that mediates virus attachment to its host receptor. The S2 subunit contains fusion protein machinery, such as the fusion peptide, two heptad-repeat sequences (HR1 and HR2) and a central helix typical of fusion glycoproteins, a transmembrane domain, and the cytosolic tail domain. In some embodiments, the coronavirus is a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), a SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a SARS-like coronavirus, a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a MERS-like coronavirus, NL63-CoV, 229E-CoV, 0C43-CoV, HKU1-CoV, WIV1-CoV, MHV, HKU9-CoV, PEDV-CoV, or SDCV.

                        "The nucleic acids can be obtained using methods that are known to those of skill in the art. Suitable nucleic acids (e.g., cDNA, genomic, or subsequences) can be cloned, or amplified by in vitro methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using suitable primers, the ligase chain reaction (LCR), the transcription-based amplification system (TAS), or the self-sustained sequence replication system (SSR).

                        "\u201cCodon optimization\u201d can be used to optimize sequences for expression in an animal and is defined as modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the cells of the animal of interest, e.g. swine, by replacing at least one, more than one, or a significant number, of codons of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that animal. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid.",
                        "As used herein, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers generally to peptides and proteins. In certain embodiments the polypeptide may be at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten or more amino acids or more or any amount in-between. A peptide is generally considered to be more than fifty amino acids. The terms \u201cfragment,\u201d \u201cderivative\u201d and \u201chomologue\u201d when referring to the polypeptides according to the present invention, means a polypeptide which retains essentially the same biological function or activity as said polypeptide, that is, act as an antigen and/or provide treatment for and/or protection against disease. Such fragments, derivatives and homologues can be chosen based on the ability to retain one or more of the biological activities of the polypeptide, that is, act as an antigen and/or provide treatment for and/or protection against the pathogen. The polypeptide vaccines of the present invention may be recombinant polypeptides, natural polypeptides or synthetic polypeptides, preferably recombinant polypeptides. One skilled in the art appreciates that it is possible that the protective polypeptide may be expressed by the gene in the host cells and the plant composition administered to the animal or extracted from the plant prior to administration.",
                        "\u201cConservatively modified variants\u201d applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given polypeptide. For instance, the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG all encode the amino acid arginine. Thus, at every position where an arginine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent substitutions\u201d or \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of \u201cconservatively modified variations.\u201d Every polynucleotide sequence described herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation, except where otherwise noted. Thus, silent substitutions are an implied feature of every nucleic acid sequence which encodes an amino acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule by standard techniques. In some embodiments, the nucleotide sequences that encode a protective polypeptide are preferably optimized for expression in a particular host cell (e.g., yeast, mammalian, plant, fungal, and the like) used to produce the polypeptide or RNA.",
                        "As to amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d referred to herein as a \u201cvariant\u201d where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. See, for example, Davis et al., \u201cBasic Methods in Molecular Biology\u201d Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn. (1994). Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.",
                        "The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M).",
                        "The isolated variant proteins can be purified from cells that naturally express it, purified from cells that have been altered to express it (recombinant), or synthesized using known protein synthesis methods. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the variant polypeptide is cloned into an expression vector, the expression vector introduced into a host cell and the variant protein expressed in the host cell. The variant protein can then be isolated from the cells by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. Many of these techniques are described in detail below.",
                        "The methods include amino acids that include an amino acid sequence that is at least about 70% identical to one that is set forth herein, more preferably at least 75%, still more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, 85.5% 86%, 86.5% 87%, 87.5% 88%, 88.5%, 89%, 89.5% still more preferably at least 90%, 90.5%, 91%, 91.5% 92%, 92.5%, 93%,94.5%, 94%, 94.5% and even more preferably at least about 95%, 95.5%, 96%, 96.5%, 97%, 97.5%, 98%, 98.5%, 99%, 95.5%, 100% identical (or any percentage in between) to an exemplified nucleotide sequence. The sequence may be modified as described previously, so long the polypeptide is capable of inducing the generation of a protective response.",
                        "The variant proteins used in the present methods can be attached to heterologous sequences to form chimeric or fusion proteins. Such chimeric and fusion proteins comprise a variant protein fused in-frame to a heterologous protein having an amino acid sequence not substantially homologous to the variant protein. The heterologous protein can be fused to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the variant protein.",
                        "A chimeric or fusion protein can be produced by standard recombinant DNA techniques. For example, DNA fragments coding for the different protein sequences are ligated together in-frame in accordance with conventional techniques. In another embodiment, the fusion gene can be synthesized by conventional techniques including automated DNA synthesizers. Alternatively, PCR amplification of gene fragments can be carried out using anchor primers which give rise to complementary overhangs between two consecutive gene fragments which can subsequently be annealed and re-amplified to generate a chimeric gene sequence (see Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 1992). Moreover, many expression vectors are commercially available that already encode a fusion moiety (e.g., a GST protein). A variant protein-encoding nucleic acid can be cloned into such an expression vector such that the fusion moiety is linked in-frame to the variant protein.",
                        "Polypeptides sometimes contain amino acids other than the 20 amino acids commonly referred to as the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Further, many amino acids, including the terminal amino acids, may be modified by natural processes, such as processing and other post-translational modifications, or by chemical modification techniques well known in the art. Common modifications that occur naturally in polypeptides are described in basic texts, detailed monographs, and the research literature, and they are well known to those of skill in the art. Accordingly, the variant peptides of the present invention also encompass derivatives or analogs in which a substituted amino acid residue is not one encoded by the genetic code, in which a substituent group is included, in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide, such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence for purification of the mature polypeptide or a pro-protein sequence.",

The term should be construed to include subunits which are obtained by both recombinant and biochemical methods.",
                        "A \u201cconstruct\u201d is a package of genetic material inserted into the genome of a cell via various techniques. A \u201cvector\u201d is any means for the transfer of a nucleic acid into a host cell. A vector may be a replicon to which another DNA segment may be attached so as to bring about the replication of the attached segment. A \u201creplicon\u201d is any genetic element (e.g., plasmid, phage, cosmid, chromosome, virus) that functions as an autonomous unit of DNA or RNA replication in vivo, i.e., capable of replication under its own control. The term \u201cvector\u201d includes both viral and nonviral means for introducing the nucleic acid into a cell in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. Viral vectors include alphavirus, retrovirus, adeno-associated virus, pox, baculovirus, vaccinia, herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and adenovirus vectors. Non-viral vectors include, but are not limited to plasmids, liposomes, electrically charged lipids (cytofectins), DNA- or RNA protein complexes, and biopolymers. In addition to a nucleic acid, a vector may also contain one or more regulatory regions, and/or selectable markers useful in selecting, measuring, and monitoring nucleic acid transfer results (transfer to which tissues, duration of expression, etc.).",

                        "Once the gene is engineered to contain desired features, such as the desired subcellular localization sequences, it may then be placed into an expression vector by standard methods. The selection of an appropriate expression vector will depend upon the method of introducing the expression vector into host cells. A typical expression vector contains prokaryotic DNA elements coding for a bacterial origin of replication and an antibiotic resistance gene to provide for the growth and selection of the expression vector in the bacterial host; a cloning site for insertion of an exogenous DNA sequence; eukaryotic DNA elements that control initiation of transcription of the exogenous gene; and DNA elements that control the processing of transcripts, such as transcription termination/polyadenylation sequences. It also can contain such sequences as are needed for the eventual integration of the vector into the host chromosome.",
                        "By \u201cpromoter\u201d is meant a regulatory region of DNA capable of regulating the transcription of a sequence linked thereto. It usually comprises a TATA box capable of directing RNA polymerase II to initiate RNA synthesis at the appropriate transcription initiation site for a particular coding sequence. The promoter is the minimal sequence sufficient to direct transcription in a desired manner. The term \u201cregulatory region\u201d is also used to refer to the sequence capable of initiating transcription in a desired manner.",
                        "A nucleic acid molecule may be used in conjunction with its own or another promoter. In one embodiment, a selection marker a nucleic acid molecule of interest can be functionally linked to the same promoter. In another embodiment, they can be functionally linked to different promoters. In yet third and fourth embodiments, the expression vector can contain two or more genes of interest that can be linked to the same promoter or different promoters. For example, one promoter can be used to drive a nucleic acid molecule of interest and the selectable marker, or a different promoter used for one or each. These other promoter elements can be those that are constitutive or sufficient to render promoter-dependent gene expression controllable as being cell-type specific, tissue-specific or time or developmental stage specific, or being inducible by external signals or agents. Such elements may be located in the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 regions of the gene. Although the additional promoter may be the endogenous promoter of a structural gene of interest, the promoter can also be a foreign regulatory sequence. Promoter elements employed to control expression of product proteins and the selection gene can be any host-compatible promoters. These can be plant gene promoters, such as, for example, the ubiquitin promoter (European patent application no. 0 342 926); the promoter for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase (ssRUBISCO) (Coruzzi et al., 1984; Broglie et al., 1984); or promoters from the tumor-inducing plasmids from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, such as the nopaline synthase, octopine synthase and mannopine synthase promoters (Velten and Schell, 1985) that have plant activity; or viral promoters such as the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 19S and 35S promoters (Guilley et al., 1982; Odell et al., 1985), the figwort mosaic virus FLt promoter (Maiti et al., 1997) or the coat protein promoter of TMV (Grdzelishvili et al., 2000). Alternatively, plant promoters such as heat shock promoters for example soybean hsp 17.5-E (Gurley et al., 1986); or ethanol-inducible promoters (Caddick et al., 1998) may be used. See International Patent Application No. WO 91/19806 for a review of illustrative plant promoters suitably employed.",
                        "A promoter can additionally comprise other recognition sequences generally positioned upstream or 5\u2032 to the TATA box, referred to as upstream promoter elements, which influence the transcription initiation rate. It is recognized that having identified the nucleotide sequences for a promoter region, it is within the state of the art to isolate and identify further regulatory elements in the 5\u2032 region upstream from the particular promoter region identified herein. Thus, the promoter region is generally further defined by comprising upstream regulatory elements such as those responsible for tissue and temporal expression of the coding sequence, enhancers and the like.",
                        "Tissue-preferred promoters can be utilized to target enhanced transcription and/or expression within a particular tissue. When referring to preferential expression, what is meant is expression at a higher level in the particular tissue than in other tissue. Examples of these types of promoters include seed preferred expression such as that provided by the phaseolin promoter (Bustos et al. (1989) The Plant Cell Vol. 1, 839-853). For dicots, seed-preferred promoters include, but are not limited to, bean \u03b2-phaseolin, napin, \u03b2-conglycinin, soybean lectin, cruciferin, and the like.

See also WO 00/12733, where seed-preferred promoters from end1 and end2 genes are disclosed. Seed-preferred promoters also include those promoters that direct gene expression predominantly to specific tissues within the seed such as, for example, the endosperm-preferred promoter of \u03b3-zein, the cryptic promoter from tobacco (Fobert et al. (1994) \u201cT-DNA tagging of a seed coat-specific cryptic promoter in tobacco\u201d Plant J. 4: 567-577), the P-gene promoter from corn (Chopra et al.

It may express during seed or embryo development, along with expression at other stages, may express strongly during seed or embryo development and to a much lesser degree at other times.",
                        "The range of available promoters includes inducible promoters. An inducible regulatory element is one that is capable of directly or indirectly activating transcription of one or more DNA sequences or genes in response to an inducer. In the absence of an inducer the DNA sequences or genes will not be transcribed. Typically, the protein factor that binds specifically to an inducible regulatory element to activate transcription is present in an inactive form which is then directly or indirectly converted to the active form by the inducer. The inducer can be a chemical agent such as a protein, metabolite, growth regulator, herbicide or phenolic compound or a physiological stress imposed directly by heat, cold, salt, or toxic elements or indirectly through the action of a pathogen or disease agent such as a virus.

                        "Retaining the protein in the vacuole is another example. Signal sequences to accomplish this are well known. For example, Raikhel U.S. Pat. No. 5,360,726 shows a vacuole signal sequence as does Warren et al at U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,174. Vacuolar targeting signals may be present either at the amino-terminal portion, (Holwerda et al., (1992) The Plant Cell, 4:307-318, Nakamura et al., (1993) Plant Physiol., 101:1-5), carboxy-terminal portion, or in the internal sequence of the targeted protein. (Tague et al., (1992) The Plant Cell, 4:307-318, Saalbach et al. (1991) The Plant Cell, 3:695-708).

                        "The term plant refers to the entire plant or plant material or plant part or plant tissue or plant cell including a collection of plant cells. It is used broadly herein to include any plant at any stage of development, or to part of a plant, including a plant cutting, a plant cell culture, a plant organ, a plant seed, and a plantlet. Plant seed parts, for example, include the pericarp or kernel, the embryo or germ, and the endoplasm. A plant cell is the structural and physiological unit of the plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. A plant cell can be in the form of an isolated single cell or aggregate of cells such as a friable callus, or a cultured cell, or can be part of a higher organized unit, for example, a plant tissue, plant organ, or plant. Thus, a plant cell can be a protoplast, a gamete producing cell, or a cell or collection of cells that can regenerate into a whole plant. A plant tissue or plant organ can be a seed, protoplast, callus, or any other groups of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. Particularly useful parts of a plant include harvestable parts and parts useful for propagation of progeny plants. A harvestable part of a plant can be any useful part of a plant, for example, flowers, pollen, seedlings, tubers, leaves, stems, fruit, seeds, roots, and the like. A part of a plant useful for propagation includes, for example, seeds, fruits, cuttings, seedlings, tubers, rootstocks, and the like. In an embodiment, the tissue culture will preferably be capable of regenerating plants. Preferably, the regenerable cells in such tissue cultures will be embryos, protoplasts, meristematic cells, callus, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks or stalks. Still further, plants may be regenerated from the tissue cultures.",

Accordingly, a wide variety of methods have been developed to insert a DNA sequence into the genome of a host cell to obtain the transcription or transcript and translation of the sequence to effect phenotypic changes in the organism. Thus, any method which provides for efficient transformation/transfection may be employed.",
                        "Methods for introducing expression vectors into plant tissue available to one skilled in the art are varied and will depend on the plant selected. Procedures for transforming a wide variety of plant species are well known and described throughout the literature. (See, for example, Miki and McHugh (2004) Biotechnol. 107, 193-232; Klein et al. (1992) Biotechnology (N Y) 10, 286-291; and Weising et al. (1988) Annu. Rev. Genet. 22, 421-477). For example, the DNA construct may be introduced into the genomic DNA of the plant cell using techniques such as microprojectile-mediated delivery (Klein et al. 1992, supra), electroporation (Fromm et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5824-5828), polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Mathur and Koncz, 1998 Methods Mol. Biol. 82, 267-276), direct gene transfer (WO 85/01856 and EP-A-275 069), in vitro protoplast transformation (U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,611), and microinjection of plant cell protoplasts or embryogenic callus (Crossway, A. (1985) Mol. Gen. Genet. 202, 179-185). Agrobacterium transformation methods of Ishida et al. (1996) and also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,616 are yet another option. Co-cultivation of plant tissue with Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a variation, where the DNA constructs are placed into a binary vector system (Ishida et al., 1996 Nat. Biotechnol. 14, 745-750). The virulence functions of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens host will direct the insertion of the construct into the plant cell DNA when the cell is infected by the bacteria. See, for example, Fraley et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 80, 4803-4807. Agrobacterium is primarily used in dicots, but monocots including maize can be transformed by Agrobacterium. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,550,318. In one of many variations on the method, Agrobacterium infection of corn can be used with heat shocking of immature embryos (Wilson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,630) or with antibiotic selection of Type II callus (Wilson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,919,494).",
                        "Rice transformation is described by Hiei et al. (1994) Plant J. 6, 271-282 and Lee et al. (1991) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 6389-6393. Standard methods for transformation of canola are described by Moloney et al. (1989) Plant Cell Reports 8, 238-242. Corn transformation is described by Fromm et al. (1990) Biotechnology (N Y) 8, 833-839 and Gordon-Kamm et al. (1990) supra. Wheat can be transformed by techniques similar to those used for transforming corn or rice. Sorghum transformation is described by Casas et al. (Casas et al. (1993). Transgenic sorghum plants via microprojectile bombardment. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 11212-11216) and barley transformation is described by Wan and Lemaux (Wan and Lemaux (1994) Generation of large numbers of independently transformed fertile barley plants.

                        "In one method, the Agrobacterium transformation methods of Ishida et al. (1996) and also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,616, are generally followed, with modifications that the inventors have found improve the number of transformants obtained. The Ishida method uses the A188 variety of maize that produces Type I callus in culture. In an embodiment the Hi II maize line is used which initiates Type II embryogenic callus in culture (Armstrong et al., 1991).",
                        "While Ishida recommends selection on phosphinothricin when using the bar or pat gene for selection, another preferred embodiment provides use of bialaphos instead. In general, as set forth in the 5,591,616 patent, and as outlined in more detail below, dedifferentiation is obtained by culturing an explant of the plant on a dedifferentiation-inducing medium for not less than seven days, and the tissue during or after dedifferentiation is contacted with Agrobacterium having the gene of interest. The cultured tissue can be callus, an adventitious embryo-like tissue or suspension cells, for example. In this preferred embodiment, the suspension of Agrobacterium has a cell population of 106 to 1011 cells/ml and are contacted for three to ten minutes with the tissue, or continuously cultured with Agrobacterium for not less than seven days. The Agrobacterium can contain plasmid pTOK162, with the gene of interest between border sequences of the T region of the plasmid, or the gene of interest may be present in another plasmid-containing Agrobacterium. The virulence region may originate from the virulence region of a Ti plasmid or Ri plasmid. The bacterial strain used in the Ishida protocol is LBA4404 with the 40 kb super binary plasmid containing three vir loci from the hypervirulent A281 strain. The plasmid has resistance to tetracycline. The cloning vector cointegrates with the super binary plasmid. Since the cloning vector has an E. coli specific replication origin, but not an Agrobacterium replication origin, it cannot survive in Agrobacterium without cointegrating with the super binary plasmid. Since the LBA4404 strain is not highly virulent, and has limited application without the super binary plasmid, the inventors have found in yet another embodiment that the EHA101 strain is preferred. It is a disarmed helper strain derived from the hypervirulent A281 strain. The cointegrated super binary/cloning vector from the LBA4404 parent is isolated and electroporated into EHA101, selecting for spectinomycin resistance. The plasmid is isolated to assure that the EHA101 contains the plasmid. EHA101 contains a disarmed pTi that carries resistance to kanamycin. See, Hood et al. (1986).",
                        "Further, the Ishida protocol as described provides for growing fresh culture of the Agrobacterium on plates, scraping the bacteria from the plates, and resuspending in the co-culture medium as stated in the 5,591,616 patent for incubation with the maize embryos. This medium includes 4.3 g MS salts, 0.5 mg nicotinic acid, 0.5 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride, 1.0 ml thiamine hydrochloride, casamino acids, 1.5 mg 2,4-D, 68.5 g sucrose and 36 g glucose per liter, all at a pH of 5.8. In a further preferred method, the bacteria are grown overnight in a 1 ml culture and then a fresh 10 ml culture is re-inoculated the next day when transformation is to occur. The bacteria grow into log phase and are harvested at a density of no more than OD600=0.5, preferably between 0.2 and 0.5. The bacteria are then centrifuged to remove the media and resuspended in the co-culture medium. Since Hi II is used, medium preferred for Hi II is used. This medium is described in considerable detail by Armstrong and Green (1985). The resuspension medium is the same as that described above. All further Hi II media are as described in Armstrong and Green (1985). The result is redifferentiation of the plant cells and regeneration into a plant. Redifferentiation is sometimes referred to as dedifferentiation, but the former term more accurately describes the process where the cell begins with a form and identity, is placed on a medium in which it loses that identity and becomes \u201creprogrammed\u201d to have a new identity. Thus, the scutellum cells become embryogenic callus.",

                        "When referring to introduction of a nucleotide sequence into a plant is meant to include transformation into the cell, as well as crossing a plant having the sequence with another plant, so that the second plant contains the heterologous sequence, as in conventional plant breeding techniques. Such breeding techniques are well known to one skilled in the art. This can be accomplished by any means known in the art for breeding plants such as, for example, cross pollination of the transgenic plants that are described above with other plants, and selection for plants from subsequent generations which express the amino acid sequence. The plant breeding methods used herein are well known to one skilled in the art. For a discussion of plant breeding techniques, see Poehlman (1995) Breeding Field Crops. AVI Publication Co., Westport Conn., 4th Edit.). Many crop plants useful in this method are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination. A plant is self-pollinating if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinating if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant. For example, in Brassica, the plant is normally self-sterile and can only be cross-pollinated unless, through discovery of a mutant or through genetic intervention, self-compatibility is obtained. In self-pollinating species, such as rice, oats, wheat, barley, peas, beans, soybeans, tobacco and cotton, the male and female plants are anatomically juxtaposed. During natural pollination, the male reproductive organs of a given flower pollinate the female reproductive organs of the same flower. Maize plants (Zea mays L.) can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques. Maize has male flowers, located on the tassel, and female flowers, located on the ear, on the same plant. It can self or cross-pollinate.",
                        "Pollination can be by any means, including but not limited to hand, wind or insect pollination, or mechanical contact between the male fertile and male sterile plant. For production of hybrid seeds on a commercial scale in most plant species pollination by wind or by insects is preferred. Stricter control of the pollination process can be achieved by using a variety of methods to make one plant pool male sterile, and the other the male fertile pollen donor. This can be accomplished by hand detassling, cytoplasmic male sterility, or control of male sterility through a variety of methods well known to the skilled breeder. Examples of more sophisticated male sterility systems include those described by Brar et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 and Albertsen et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,341 and 6,013,859.",

An example of a description of this and other plant breeding methodologies that are well known can be found in references such as Neal (1988). In a typical backcross protocol, the original variety of interest (recurrent parent) is crossed to a second variety (nonrecurrent parent) that carries the single gene of interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a plant is obtained wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the single transferred gene from the nonrecurrent parent.",
                        "Selection and propagation techniques described above can yield a plurality of transgenic plants that are harvested in a conventional manner. The plant or any parts expressing the recombinant polypeptide can be used in a commercial process, or the polypeptide extracted. When using the plant or part itself, it can, for example, be made into flour and then applied in the commercial process. Polypeptide extraction from biomass can be accomplished by known methods. Downstream processing for any production system refers to all unit operations after product synthesis, in this case protein production in transgenic seed (Kusnadi, A. R., Nikolov, Z. L., Howard, J. A., 1997. Biotechnology and Bioengineering. 56:473-484). For example, seed can be processed either as whole seed ground into flour or, fractionated and the germ separated from the hulls and endosperm. If germ is used, it is usually defatted using an extraction process and the remaining crushed germ ground into a meal or flour. In some cases, the germ is used directly in the process, or the protein can be extracted (See, e.g., WO 98/39461). Extraction is generally made into aqueous buffers at specific pH to enhance recombinant protein extraction and minimize native seed protein extraction. Subsequent protein concentration or purification can follow.",

These include immunogens based on the S1 moiety (Oh et al., 2014) (Makadiya et al., 2016), the S2 moiety (Okda et al., 2017), and a smaller portion known as the core neutralizing epitope or COE (amino acids 499-638) that has been identified as containing neutralizing epitopes (Chang et al., 2002). However, the prototype vaccines require the purification of the S protein which has been difficult to produce at high levels in several recombinant systems (Makadiya et al., 2016; Piao et al., 2016) (Van Noi and Chung, 2017). In addition, parenterally delivered vaccines are labor-intensive for commercial operations and not likely to provide the strong mucosal response thought to be required for better protection against transmission across the mucus membranes.",
                                "Oral administration would eliminate the need for injection and greatly facilitate widespread vaccination against PEDV. Precedent for oral immunization for PEDV includes a number of studies expressing PEDV S or N proteins in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. Oral delivery of these products elicits an immune response and protection upon challenge (Di-qiu et al., 2012; Hou et al., 2018). The S protein for PEDV has been produced in tobacco, rice and other plants and elicits an immune response with neutralizing activity against the virus (Kang et al., 2005); (Bae et al., 2003; Huy et al., 2012; Huy and Kim, 2019). Ideally this protection could be achieved in a system in which the antigen is stable during production, storage and transport and does not require purification of the antigen away from other toxic compounds.",
                                "Maize grain has emerged as a preferred option for oral vaccines as it provides high levels of accumulation of the recombinant proteins and bioencapsulation of the protein to protect it from degradation the digestive tract. The maize system also has many inherent properties making it amenable to create a practical low-cost oral vaccine for livestock such as; stability of recombinant proteins that retain activity for years in the grain allowing for long-term storage, transport at ambient temperatures, processing of the grain at will rather than a requirement to process large batches immediately upon harvest, and as it is a major component of feed, it provides a safe and non-diluted matrix for delivery.",
                                "Early studies with a spike protein from another coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), demonstrated that an orally-delivered maize-based candidate vaccine elicited an immune response and provided protection upon a challenge in pigs. Other maize-based vaccines have also shown efficacy in animal trials (Hayden et al., 2015) and safety in a human clinical trial. There is also one report of expression of the PEDV spike protein COE in maize, which elicited an immune response in mice (Man et al., 2014). Our previous work demonstrated high expression of the S antigen in maize that would allow for a heat stable, low-cost production supply of the antigen. In addition, when pigs were oral administered the maize-produced S protein, high levels of sera neutralization antibodies were observed after a challenge with the virus. However, because the disease symptoms are acute only in nursing pigs, protection from the virus could not be determined. In this report, we administered the vaccine candidate to na\u00efve sow/gilts and after farrowing, their newborn pigs were challenged with the virus to determine if the dams could provide passive immunization to the newborn pigs.",

In particular, pigs in Treatment 1 piglets were significantly heavier than average and the model adjusts for the Day 0 weight, which was a highly significant predictor of survival. The model adjusts the survival rates of each treatment as if they all had the same average weight. So, part of the higher survival rate for Treatment 1 is being attributed (appropriately) to the weight effect rather than the treatment effect. Once the weight effect is accounted for, the effect of Treatment 1 is lower. This was confirmed this by running a model without the Day 0 weight. The values in Table 4 results were verified using 3 different computer programs (R, SAS, and SPSS) to make sure that there wasn't an error in the R package initially used for the analysis. They all match up with only tiny differences due to the different estimation algorithms used by the programs. The different letters indicate significant differences between treatments.",

The orally delivered treatment provided protection from the virus demonstrating that this can be an effective manner to deliver efficacious vaccines to swine. NABs could be detected in both sow sera and milk that may be in part responsible for providing protection. However, unexpectedly sows that received the S protein either parenterally or orally had a reduced level of most cytokines. This reduced level of cytokines is passed on through the milk to the nursing piglets. As coronavirus is known to create a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d in which the high levels of cytokines are thought to be associated with the most severe symptoms leading to death. This reduced level of most cytokines may play a significant role in protection (consistent with this trend, INF levels increased, but this is desirable for a reduced non-specific reaction). This phenomenon is likely to occur for other S proteins from other coronaviruses as well. Furthermore, the reduction in cytokine levels may help protect animals from other diseases where cytokine levels play a significant role."
