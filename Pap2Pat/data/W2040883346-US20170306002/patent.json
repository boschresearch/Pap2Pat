                        "In 2009 a novel swine-origin H1N1 virus emerged in humans, resulting in the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. This A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) virus has continued to circulate and was the predominant strain in the USA during the most recent 2013/14 influenza season (CDC. Update: influenza activity-United States, Sep. 29, 2013-Feb. 8, 2014. MMWR 63, 148-54 (2014)). Although the overall disease incidence was lower in the 2013/14 winter than during the 2009 outbreak, adults 18-64 years old were at higher risk of severe disease and death when compared to the traditionally highest risk 65+ year age group. This corresponded to a low rate of vaccination in young adults (CDC. FluVaxView. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, available on the internet <cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/1314season_htm>. (2014)). Fortunately, most pH1N1 viruses are sensitive to the clinically available NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, and therefore patients can be offered treatments early after infection (Moscona, A. N Engl J Med 353, 1363-73 (2005)). Oseltamivir is often the treatment of choice because it is available as an oral formulation and therefore easier to administer than inhalation of zanamivir. However, NA inhibitor-resistant influenza viruses can be selected quickly in treated patients (Memoli, M. J. et al. J Infect Dis 203, 348-57 (2011)), or can sometimes emerge without an apparent link to treatment (Sheu, T. G. et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 52, 3284-92 (2008)). Indeed, during the 2013/14 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 viruses were reported in China, Japan and the USA (WHO. World Health Organization, see the internet at <.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2014_15_north/en/> (2014)). The increased pH1N1 influenza activity and the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 viruses add urgency to the need for additional influenza antivirals. It would be advantageous for the new therapeutics to inhibit influenza virus through mechanisms distinct from oseltamivir and zanamivir, to help assure that NA inhibitor-resistant viruses remain sensitive to the new agents."

                        "NA-inhibiting antibodies can have similar effectiveness against influenza as chemical NA inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir. Without being bound by theory, since the mechanisms underlying enzyme inhibition are different (oseltamivir and zanamivir bind within the NA active pocket and interrupt the enzyme reaction, while antibodies usually bind to epitopes surrounding the active pocket and inhibit NA activity by restricting access of the natural, large glycoconjugate substrates to the active site), the efficacy of NA-specific antibodies is unlikely to be impacted by changes in sequence that result in oseltamivir or zanamivir resistance. Consequently, NA-specific mAbs, especially those that bind to conserved epitopes, are ideal therapeutic candidates against seasonal and pandemic influenza.

The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.

In some examples monoclonal antibodies are isolated from a subject. Monoclonal antibodies can have conservative amino acid substitutions which have substantially no effect on antigen binding or other immunoglobulin functions.

There are two types of light chain, lambda (\u03bb) and kappa (\u03ba). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE.",

In additional embodiments, only the heavy chain variable region is required. For example, naturally occurring camelid antibodies consisting of a heavy chain only are functional and stable in the absence of light chain (see, e.g., Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature, 363:446-448, 1993; Sheriff et al., Nat.

The sequences of the framework regions of different light or heavy chains are relatively conserved within a species. The framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to position and align the CDRs in three-dimensional space.",
                                "The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The amino acid sequence boundaries of a given CDR can be readily determined using any of a number of well-known schemes, including those described by Kabat et al.

The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3 (from the N-terminus to C-terminus), and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a VH CDR3 is the CDR3 from the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a VL CDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. Light chain CDRs are sometimes referred to as LCDR1, LCDR2, and LCDR3. Heavy chain CDRs are sometimes referred to as HCDR1, HCDR2, and HCDR3.",

Antibody fragments include antigen binding fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (see, e.g., Kontermann and Dubel (Ed), Antibody Engineering, Vols. 1-2, 2nd Ed., Springer Press, 2010).",

Diabodies also are included, which are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see, for example, Holliger et al., Proc.

Useful detection agents include fluorescent compounds, including fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-1-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin, lanthanide phosphors and the like. Bioluminescent markers are also of use, such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or yellow fluorescent protein. An antibody can also be labeled with enzymes that are useful for detection, such as horseradish peroxidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase and the like. When an antibody or antibody fragment is labeled with a detectable enzyme, it can be detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a reaction product that can be discerned. For example, when the agent horseradish peroxidase is present the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is visually detectable. An antibody or antibody fragment may also be labeled with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding. It should be noted that the avidin itself can be labeled with an enzyme or a fluorescent label.",

Antibodies or antibody fragments can also be labeled with lanthanides (such as europium and dysprosium), and manganese. Paramagnetic particles such as superparamagnetic iron oxide are also of use as labels. An antibody or antibody fragment can also be labeled with a predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (such as leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags). In some embodiments, labels are attached by spacer arms of various lengths to reduce potential steric hindrance.",

Thus, for example, radiolabels may be detected using photographic film or scintillation counters, fluorescent markers may be detected using a photodetector to detect emitted illumination. Enzymatic labels are typically detected by providing the enzyme with a substrate and detecting the reaction product produced by the action of the enzyme on the substrate, and colorimetric labels are detected by simply visualizing the colored label.",

Thus, host cells are provided containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody or fragments thereof, or a heavy or light chain thereof, or portion thereof, or a single-chain antibody of the invention, operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In certain embodiments for the expression of double-chained antibodies, vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co-expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule, as detailed below.",
                                "Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post-translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the antibody or portion thereof expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERO, BHK, Hela, COS, MDCK, 293, 3T3, W138, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT2O and T47D, NSO (a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any functional immunoglobulin chains), SP2/0, CRL7030 and HsS78Bst cells. In one embodiment, human cell lines are of use. In one embodiment, the human cell line PER.C6 (Crucell, Netherlands) can be used. Additional cell lines which may be used as hosts for expression of recombinant antibodies include, but are not limited to, insect cells (e.g. Sf21/Sf9, Trichoplusia ni Bti-Tn5b1-4) or yeast cells (e.g. S. cerevisiae, Pichia, U.S. Pat. No. 7,326,681), plant cells (US Published Patent Application No. 20080066200); and chicken cells (PCT Publication No. WO2008142124).",
                                "The host cell can be a gram positive bacteria including, but not limited to, Bacillus, Streptococcus, Streptomyces, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Clostridium, Geobacillus, and Oceanobacillus. Methods for expressing protein in gram positive bacteria, such as Lactobacillus are well known in the art, see for example, U.S. Published Patent Application No. 20100/080774. Expression vectors for lactobacillus are described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,388, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,571. Leader sequences can be included for expression in Lactobacillus. Gram negative bacteria include, but not limited to, E. coli, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Flavobacterium, Fusobacterium, Ilyobacter, Neisseria, and Ureaplasma.",
                                "One or more DNA sequences encoding the antibody or fragment thereof can be expressed in vitro by DNA transfer into a suitable host cell. The term also includes any progeny of the subject host cell. It is understood that all progeny may not be identical to the parental cell since there may be mutations that occur during replication. Methods of stable transfer, meaning that the foreign DNA is continuously maintained in the host, are known in the art.",
                                "The expression of nucleic acids encoding the isolated proteins described herein can be achieved by operably linking the DNA to a promoter (which is either constitutive or inducible), followed by incorporation into an expression cassette. The promoter can be any promoter of interest, including a cytomegalovirus promoter and a human T cell lymphotrophic virus promoter (HTLV)-1. Optionally, an enhancer, such as a cytomegalovirus enhancer, is included in the construct. The cassettes can be suitable for replication and integration in either prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Typical expression cassettes contain specific sequences useful for regulation of the expression of the DNA encoding the protein. For example, the expression cassettes can include appropriate promoters, enhancers, transcription and translation terminators, initiation sequences, a start codon (i.e., ATG) in front of a protein-encoding gene, splicing signal for introns, sequences for the maintenance of the correct reading frame of that gene to permit proper translation of mRNA, and stop codons. The vector can encode a selectable marker, such as a marker encoding drug resistance (for example, ampicillin or tetracycline resistance).",
                                "To obtain high level expression of a cloned gene, it is desirable to construct expression cassettes which contain, at the minimum, a strong promoter to direct transcription, a ribosome binding site for translational initiation (internal ribosomal binding sequences), and a transcription/translation terminator. For E. coli, this includes a promoter such as the T7, trp, lac, or lambda promoters, a ribosome binding site, and preferably a transcription termination signal. For eukaryotic cells, the control sequences can include a promoter and/or an enhancer derived from, for example, an immunoglobulin gene, HTLV, SV40 or cytomegalovirus, and a polyadenylation sequence, and can further include splice donor and/or acceptor sequences (for example, CMV and/or HTLV splice acceptor and donor sequences). The cassettes can be transferred into the chosen host cell by well-known methods such as transformation or electroporation for E. coli and calcium phosphate treatment, electroporation or lipofection for mammalian cells. Cells transformed by the cassettes can be selected by resistance to antibiotics conferred by genes contained in the cassettes, such as the amp, gpt, neo and hyg genes.",
                                "When the host is a eukaryote, such methods of transfection of DNA as calcium phosphate coprecipitates, conventional mechanical procedures such as microinjection, electroporation, insertion of a plasmid encased in liposomes, or virus vectors may be used. Eukaryotic cells can also be cotransformed with polynucleotide sequences encoding the antibody, labeled antibody, or functional fragment thereof, and a second foreign DNA molecule encoding a selectable phenotype, such as the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene. Another method is to use a eukaryotic viral vector, such as simian virus 40 (SV40) or bovine papilloma virus, to transiently infect or transform eukaryotic cells and express the protein (see for example, Eukaryotic Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Gluzman ed., 1982). One of skill in the art can readily use an expression systems such as plasmids and vectors of use in producing proteins in cells including higher eukaryotic cells such as the COS, CHO, HeLa and myeloma cell lines.",
                                "Modifications can be made to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide described herein without diminishing its biological activity. Some modifications can be made to facilitate the cloning, expression, or incorporation of the targeting molecule into a fusion protein. Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art and include, for example, termination codons, a methionine added at the amino terminus to provide an initiation, site, additional amino acids placed on either terminus to create conveniently located restriction sites, or additional amino acids (such as poly His) to aid in purification steps. In addition to recombinant methods, the antibodies, antigen binding fragments, and effector moieties such as labels of the present disclosure can also be constructed in whole or in part using standard peptide synthesis well known in the art.",
                                "Once expressed, the recombinant antigen binding fragments, antibodies, and/or effector molecules can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, and the like (see, generally, R. Scopes, PROTEIN PURIFICATION, Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 1982). The antibodies, antigen binding fragments and effector molecules (such as labels) need not be 100% pure. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, if to be used therapeutically, the polypeptides should be substantially free of endotoxin.",

See, Buchner et al., Anal. Biochem. 205:263-270, 1992; Pluckthun, Biotechnology 9:545, 1991; Huse et al., Science 246:1275, 1989 and Ward et al., Nature 341:544, 1989.",
                                "Often, functional heterologous proteins from E. coli or other bacteria are isolated from inclusion bodies and require solubilization using strong denaturants, and subsequent refolding. During the solubilization step, as is well known in the art, a reducing agent must be present to separate disulfide bonds. An exemplary buffer with a reducing agent is: 0.1 M Tris pH 8, 6 M guanidine, 2 mM EDTA, 0.3 M DTE (dithioerythritol). Reoxidation of the disulfide bonds can occur in the presence of low molecular weight thiol reagents in reduced and oxidized form, as described in Saxena et al., Biochemistry 9: 5015-5021, 1970, and especially as described by Buchner et al., supra.",
                                "Renaturation is typically accomplished by dilution (for example, 100-fold) of the denatured and reduced protein into refolding buffer. An exemplary buffer is 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 M L-arginine, 8 mM oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and 2 mM EDTA.",
                                "As a modification to the two chain antibody purification protocol, the heavy and light chain regions are separately solubilized and reduced and then combined in the refolding solution. An exemplary yield is obtained when these two proteins are mixed in a molar ratio such that a 5-fold molar excess of one protein over the other is not exceeded. Excess oxidized glutathione or other oxidizing low molecular weight compounds can be added to the refolding solution after the redox-shuffling is completed.",

Solid phase synthesis of the polypeptides of less than about 50 amino acids in length can be accomplished by attaching the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are described by Barany & Merrifield, The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. 2: Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part A. pp. 3-284; Merrifield et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2156, 1963, and Stewart et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd ed., Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, Ill., 1984. Proteins of greater length may be synthesized by condensation of the amino and carboxyl termini of shorter fragments. Methods of forming peptide bonds by activation of a carboxyl terminal end (such as by the use of the coupling reagent N, N\u2032-dicylohexylcarbodimide) are well known in the art. Once an antibody molecule has been produced, it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule, for example, by chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, particularly by affinity for the specific antigens Protein A or Protein G, and sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further, the antibodies or fragments thereof may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences (referred to herein as \u201ctags\u201d) described above or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification."

Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).

For a broad overview of protein delivery systems see, Banga, A. J., Therapeutic Peptides and Proteins: Formulation, Processing, and Delivery Systems, Technomic Publishing Company, Inc., Lancaster, Pa., (1995). Particulate systems include microspheres, microparticles, microcapsules, nanocapsules, nanospheres, and nanoparticles. Microcapsules contain the therapeutic protein, such as a cytotoxin or a drug, as a central core. In microspheres the therapeutic is dispersed throughout the particle. Particles, microspheres, and microcapsules smaller than about 1 \u03bcm are generally referred to as nanoparticles, nanospheres, and nanocapsules, respectively. Capillaries have a diameter of approximately 5 \u03bcm so that only nanoparticles are administered intravenously. Microparticles are typically around 100 \u03bcm in diameter and are administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. See, for example, Kreuter, J., Colloidal Drug Delivery Systems, J.

For example, the block copolymer, polaxamer 407, exists as a viscous yet mobile liquid at low temperatures but forms a semisolid gel at body temperature. It has been shown to be an effective vehicle for formulation and sustained delivery of recombinant interleukin-2 and urease (Johnston et al., Pharm. Res. 9:425-434, 1992; and Pec et al., J. Parent. Sci. Tech. 44(2):58-65, 1990). Alternatively, hydroxyapatite has been used as a microcarrier for controlled release of proteins (Ijntema et al., Int. J. Pharm. 112:215-224, 1994). In yet another aspect, liposomes are used for controlled release as well as drug targeting of the lipid-capsulated drug (Betageri et al., Liposome Drug Delivery Systems, Technomic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa.

Exemplary doses include 1 to 10 mg/kg, such as 2 to 8 mg/kg, such as 3 to 6 mg/kg. Considerable experience is available in the art in the administration of antibody drugs, which have been marketed in the U.S. since the approval of R\u00ae in 1997. Antibodies and antigen binding fragments can be administered by slow infusion, rather than in an intravenous push or bolus. In one example, a higher loading dose is administered, with subsequent, maintenance doses being administered at a lower level. For example, an initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg may be infused over a period of some 90 minutes, followed by weekly maintenance doses for 4-8 weeks of 2 mg/kg infused over a 30 minute period if the previous dose was well tolerated.",

The detection of the immune complex indicates that an N1 subtype influenza virus, such as A(H1N1)pdm09-virus, is present in the sample, and/or that the subject has an N1 subtype influenza virus infection. When using a control sample along with the test sample, complex is detected in both samples and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of the N1 subtype influenza virus in the test sample. In some embodiments, the control is a standard value. In other embodiments, the control is the binding of the monoclonal antibody or antigen binding fragment to a control sample comprising a known quantity of neuraminidase. The control can also be the binding of the monoclonal antibody or antigen binding fragment to a control sample from a subject known not to have an influenza virus infection.",

An ELLA measures the ability of antibodies or pharmaceutical agents to inhibit NA activity. In the assay, a NA substrate, fetuin, is immobilized to the surface of wells of a protein-binding plate. NA is added to the substrate in the presence of different concentrations of antibody and incubated for a time period that allows the enzyme to cleave sialic acid from fetuin in control wells that do not contain antibody or NA inhibitors. Peanut agglutinin (PNA) conjugated to a label, such as, but not limited to, horse radish peroxidase is then added to the wells. The binding of PNA to molecules in the well that become exposed by the removal of sialic acid indicates how much neuraminidase activity is present. If antibodies inhibit this activity, the signal is in proportion to the amount of antibody present. In one example, the assay is used to measure the potency of NA-specific antibodies, derivatives of antibodies or other NA inhibitors, with the disclosed antibodies included in the ELLA as a reference standard.",

The detection of the immune complex confirm the vaccine will be effective. In one example, the detection of the immune complex in the sample indicates that the vaccine component, such as such as an NA antigen assumes a conformation capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies.",

As is well known to one of skill in the art, a second antibody is chosen that is able to specifically bind the specific species and class of the first antibody. For example, if the first antibody is a human IgG, then the secondary antibody may be an anti-human-lgG.

The antigenic sites of the NA of a seasonal H1N1 virus, A/Brisbane/59/2007 (BR/07), were mapped and a site was identified that is conserved in the NA of seasonal H1N1, pH1N1 and H5N1 viruses. Prophylactic treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for this antigenic site protected mice against lethal challenge with the homologous and heterologous N1-containing viruses, including pH1N1. However, these antibodies were less effective in inhibiting pH1N1 virus than the homologous virus (Wan, H. et al., J Virol 87, 9290-300 (2013)). mAbs against the NA of pH1N1 virus A/California/07/2009 (CA/09) were generated. The characterization of one of these mAbs, CD6, which is effective in inhibiting pH1N1 virus in both in vitro and in vivo studies, is disclosed below, with a focus on the crystallographic analysis of the CA/09 NA in complex with CD6 Fab. A unique epitope bridging neighboring NA monomers, with a large number of contacts between antibody and antigen is disclosed. This epitope is conserved amongst circulating pH1N1 viruses, and is a target for the development of novel therapeutics against influenza."

This reassortant virus was elected for generation of escape variants in order to keep the consistence of using H6 reassortant viruses in subsequent ELLA. As the initial selection did not result in escape variants that resisted inhibition by CD6 in plaque assay, further selections were performed. Briefly, allantoic fluid (P1) from the initial selection was pooled and inoculated into eggs to allow the expansion of residual parent virus (if any) and potential variants. Allantoic fluid collected from these eggs (P2) was pooled, mixed with mAb CD6 and inoculated into eggs again. This process was repeated 2 more times, and the resultant P5 allantoic fluid was collected from individual eggs and tested in plaque assay.

In plaque assays with Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, both mAbs significantly reduced CA/09 plaque size (FIG. 1C).

Nat Commun 2, 388 (2011); van der Vries, E. et al. PLoS Pathog 8, e1002914 (2012)) suggests that the binding of CD6 does not induce any major conformation changes to the CA/09 NA structure. While the 150-loop of the active site of pH1N1 NA has been reported in both an open and closed conformation (Amaro et al., supra; van der Vries et al., supra) in this Fab/NA complex structure, the CA/09 NA 150-loop adopts the reported open conformation. Additional positive electron density was observed at 3 of the 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites Asn88, Asn146 and Asn235. Nine sugar residues were manually fitted into the density at these positions. These glycosylated sites are not within the CD6 epitope.",

L. et al. Structure 2, 733-46 (1994)) and one from a N2 NA-Ab complex (Venkatramani, L. et al. J Mol Biol 356, 651-63 (2006)). Similar to these complexes, four CD6 Fabs bind to one NA tetramer. However, the CD6 epitope is novel, forming an antibody footprint that bridges two adjacent monomers in the NA tetramer (FIG. 3A). The CD6 heavy (H) and light (L) chains both contribute to the antibody footprint (FIG. 3B). Altogether there are 30 amino acids within NA that are in contact with the antibody. The H chain of CD6 Fab makes the majority of the antigen-antibody contacts, and forms a bridge between the neighboring NA monomers. The area on each monomer that is buried by CD6 was calculated by PISA (Krissinel, E. & Henrick, K. J Mol Biol 372, 774-97 (2007)) as 187 \u212b2 and 528 \u212b2 (FIG. 4A). A large surface area of H and L chains (497 \u212b2 and 392 \u212b2) is buried (FIG. 4B) and, as for other NA-Fab complexes, the interacting faces of antigen and antibody show excellent shape complementarity.",

Asp451 of the NA interacts with the HCDR3 loop, forming both a hydrogen bond with Tyr104 and an indirect interaction with Arg100 through a water molecule. Ser95, Asn449 and Asp451 are in close proximity to one another, forming a focal point of interactions with HCDR1 (including a hydrogen bond to Thr31) and HCDR3 (including a hydrogen bond to Tyr104) (FIG. 4C). HCDR3 is unique in that this loop extends between the NA monomers. Ile103, Tyr 104, Tyr105 and Tyr106 at the tip of the HCDR3 loop consequently are in positions to have hydrophobic interactions with the main chain atoms of residues in both NA monomers: Asn449, Ser450, Asp451 of one monomer and Ile216, Lys262, Ile263, Va1264, Lys265 and Ser266 of the neighboring monomer (FIG. 9A).

The impact of each NA mutation on CD6 binding was determined by ELISA, in which 293T cells transfected with mutant expression plasmids were used as antigen. Of the single point mutations tested, those at positions at 375 and 378 (W375A, W375G and N378A) did not support expression of NA, as examined with mouse serum against CA/09 (data not shown). The impact of substitutions at another 15 NA residues was determined by comparing the relative binding of CD6 to each mutant NA and the wild-type (wt) CA/09 NA. The S95N substitution decreased the binding of CD6 (ELISA signal (OD490) with CD6<0.4) but not CA/09-specific mouse serum (OD490\u02dc1.2), while a conservative substitution (to Ala) at this position did not affect the binding (FIG. 5A; OD values with both CD6 and mouse serum were \u02dc1.1, resulting in relative binding close to that of wt CA/09 NA). Although the hydroxyl group of Ser95 in NA does not interact directly with CD6, Ser95 contributes to the interaction with antibody through hydrophobic contacts with multiple residues (Thr28, Thr31 and Tyr32) of the HCDR1 loop (FIG. 9A). Structural modeling suggests that a substitution with a bulky hydrophilic side chain such as Asn could potentially disrupt binding in this region, in particular the hydrogen bonds between Asn449 of the NA with Thr31 of the HCDR1 loop. Asn is present at position 95 in the NA of VN/04, partially explaining why CD6 cannot bind to this virus. Residues at positions 220, 221, 250, 263, 264, 267, 270 and 389 of the CA/09 NA were mutated to those present in BR/07 (Table 3).",

These data suggest that the lack of binding to BR/07 and VN/04 NA by CD6 is determined by multiple interactions and may reflect differences in the quaternary structure of the NA tetramers.",
                                "To identify mutations in NA that would allow replication of virus in the presence of CD6, escape variants were selected in eggs inoculated with a mixture of CD6 and H6N1CA/09 virus. Several rounds of selection were required before escape variants that resisted inhibition by CD6 in plaque assays were identified. All of the 12 variants selected had a double mutation, N449D and D451G, in the NA. As indicated by two representative variants (labeled as mutants A and B in FIG. 5B), the NA enzyme activity of these variants was still effectively inhibited by mAb HF5, but was resistant to inhibition by CD6 (FIG. 5B), suggesting that these two residues are critical for the interaction between CD6 and CA/09 NA. Indeed, in ELISA with NA expressed on 293T cells, D451G mutation reduced the relative binding of CD6 to below 10%, while the N449D/D451G double mutation abolished CD6 binding (FIG. 5A). In both the single and double mutants, the expression of NA was decreased but detectable with mouse serum (OD490\u02dc0.65), suggesting that these changes destabilize the NA protein. The NA with N449D and D451G double mutation was less efficient than the wt NA in cleaving the substrate (FIG. 10), suggesting that its stability/activity was impaired. Interestingly, the N449D mutation alone did not have a big impact on CD6 binding. An N449K mutation, present in some recent pH1N1 isolates, did not significantly reduce CD6 binding either (FIG. 5A). These data suggest that residue 451 is a pivotal contact for CD6. Asp451 interacts directly with Tyr104 and indirectly, via a water molecule, with Arg100 on HCDR3 of CD6 (FIG. 9A). In addition, its main chain oxygen interacts with the hydroxyl of Thr215 in the neighboring NA monomer. Thus, a mutation at this residue could affect mAb binding either directly or indirectly by destabilizing the NA dimer. Selection of the double N449D and D451G mutation in escape variants suggests a potential compensatory effect of N449D to stabilize the dimer since this latter mutation does not diminish CD6 binding on its own."

                                "As the X-ray crystallography showed that the binding by CD6 Fab did not change the conformation of NA, it is likely that CD6-mediated inhibition of NA is through steric hindrance, i.e., CD6 blocks the access of substrate to the NA active site. This hypothesis is supported by different experimental approaches. First, the inhibition of NA activity by CD6 was affected by the size of the substrate. While CD6 inhibited the cleavage of fetuin (FIG. 1A), a large molecule with a molecular weight (MW) of 49 kD, it did not inhibit NA from cleaving a small substrate 2\u2032-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MU-NANA; MW: 489 D) (FIG. 6A). This also confirms that CD6 binding does not have an allosteric effect on the enzyme active site. Unlike CD6, antibody HF5 inhibited the cleavage of both fetuin and MU-NANA by CA/09 NA (FIG. 1B and FIG. 6A). Second, the inhibition of NA activity by CD6 was impacted by the size of antibody. In assays using fetuin as substrate, the whole CD6 molecule (MW: 150 kD) inhibited NA activity most efficiently, with slightly less inhibition by the CD6 Fab2 (MW: 110 kD). However, there was little inhibition by the CD6 Fab (MW: 50 kD) even at the highest tested concentration of 40 nM (20 \u03bcg ml\u22121) (FIG. 6B). This low level of inhibition was not due to the lack of binding of NA by the CD6 Fab, as ELISA results showed similar binding of NA by Fab, Fab2 and the whole IgG, especially at higher concentrations (FIG. 11). These data demonstrate that CD6 inhibits NA activity through steric hindrance rather than though structural distortion to inactivate the enzyme.",
                                "Because binding of NA antibody may also interfere with neighboring HA molecules, it was tested whether the bound CD6 molecule also hinders HA function. Pre-mixing CA/09 virus with CD6 before infecting MDCK cells did not affect the number and size of CA/09 plaques (FIG. 6C); however, when CD6 was supplemented in the agar overlay instead of being added to the virus inoculum, it inhibited the formation of CA/09 plaques (FIG. 1C and FIG. 6C). This finding shows that CD6 inhibited virus release from infected cells, rather than blocking virus attachment and entry into cells."

                                "To determine whether the circulating pH1N1 viruses with changes in the CD6 epitope have emerged, all available pH1N1 NA gene sequences from GISAID (www.gisaid.org) were analyzed, excluding duplicates, those without full dates of collection or propagated in eggs. It was found that since the emergence of pH1N1 virus in 2009, very few viruses with NA mutations at amino acids 95 (n=109; 1.5%) or 449 (n=38; 0.5%) have emerged (out of 7958 available pH1N1 NA sequences). However, more viruses have been isolated with a substitution at Asp451 (n=196; 2.5%). The D451G mutation that reduces CD6 binding arose sporadically among several different NA lineages since 2009 (FIG. 12), and was for a time fixed in the clade 6A subset of pH1N1 viruses. A Bayesian molecular clock analysis was performed to estimate the date of origin for the D451G mutation in the NA gene from clade 6 and showed that it arose in early 2010 (2010.026, Bayesian confidence interval, 2008.824-2010.929) along with an additional mutation N386S, within NA genetic clade 6A. Although Asn386 is a predicted glycosylation site, occupancy of this site was not apparent in the final structure. However, the B-factors for this residue are higher than its neighboring residues, suggesting that this site may indeed be glycosylated. The D451G mutation was noticeable in the NA of viruses sequenced in 2012 (Table 4) but was present in a much smaller proportion of sequences in 2013 (\u02dc3% of available pH1N1 NA sequences).",
                                "The change in proportion of pH1N1 viruses with the D451G mutation corresponds with the decreased circulation of pH1N1 viruses from genetic group 6A since 2012. Approximately 95% of the viruses that circulated in 2013 contained NA of genetic clade 6B, which retains the CD6 epitope. To date, none of the NA sequences available in GISAID contain the N449D/D451G double mutation.",
                                "Consistent with the greatly reduced CD6 binding to the D451G mutant NA of CA/09 observed in cell-based ELISA (FIG. 5A), this mutation alone resulted in significant loss of CD6's ability to inhibit enzyme activity (FIG. 7A). Since this mutation is present in clade 6A NA of some viruses isolated in 2012 (FIG. 12), it was tested whether this clade of NA had become resistant to inhibition by CD6. Surprisingly, it observed that the NA of A/Bangladesh/2021/2012 (BA/12), a reference pH1N1 virus that has a clade 6A NA, retained sensitivity to CD6 inhibition (FIG. 7A). Besides the D451G mutation, BA/12 NA has additional changes, including V106I, V241I, N248D, N369K and N386S. It is not known how these additional changes help to retain the sensitivity of BA/12 NA to CD6 inhibition. Unlike CD6, the control mAb HF5 did not inhibit the NA of CA/09 when it was engineered to contain an N369K mutation, suggesting that HF5 recognizes an epitope with amino acid 369 as one of the key contacts. This mutation is contained in the NA of BA/12 and therefore, as expected, BA/12 NA was not susceptible to HF5 inhibition (FIG. 7B). It is encouraging that CD6 remains effective against mutant H1N1 viruses with variations in the CD6 epitope and the epitopes recognized by other antibodies (e.g., the HF5 epitope); continued monitoring on the sensitivity of pH1N1 viruses to CD6 will help to determine whether CD6-resistant variants can arise.",
                                "While variants with amino acid changes within the CD6 epitope are infrequent, some pH1N1 strains have developed resistance to current antiviral drugs, including NA inhibitors (Storms, A. D. et al. Emerg Infect Dis 18, 308-11 (2012); Memoli, M. J. et al. Clin Infect Dis 50, 1252-5 (2010)). The ability of antibody CD6 to inhibit the NA activity of A/Bethesda/NIH107-D31/2009, a pH1N1 virus which is resistant to both oseltamivir and peramivir due to a H275Y mutation in the NA (Memoli, M. J. et al. J Infect Dis 203, 348-57 (2011); Memoli et al., 2010, supra) was tested. CD6 inhibited the drug-resistant virus at very low concentrations (IC50: 29 ng ml\u22121) (FIG. 13), highlighting the potential of the CD6 epitope to serve as a target for alternative antibody therapeutics against pH1N1 virus infection.",
                                "The results presented herein show that CD6, a NA-specific mAb, protects mice against lethal challenge with the reassortant pH1N1 virus CA/09-X179A, making it an antibody candidate for treating infection with pH1N1 viruses, especially those resistant to licensed NA inhibitors. The CD6 epitope was elucidated by x-ray crystallography and the interactions that are most important for activity were investigated. The data show that the CD6 epitope is unique, spanning neighboring NA monomers, with 30 amino acids serving as antibody contacts.",
                                "The results presented herein provide the first structural report for a N1 NA/mAb complex. In addition, unlike the N2 (Gulati, U. et al., J Virol 76, 12274-80 (2002)) and N9 (Tulip, W. R. et al., J Mol Biol 227, 122-48 (1992); Malby, R. L. et al., Structure 2, 733-46 (1994); Colman, P. M. et al., Nature 326, 358-63 (1987); Lee, J. T. et al., Virology 300, 255-68 (2002))/Fab crystal structures that define epitopes on the upper face of individual NA monomers, the CD6 epitope differs by spanning the lateral face of neighboring N1 monomers. Although an epitope present in intact dimers was also proposed for the N8 subtype-specific mAb (N8-4) based on analysis of mAb escape mutants (Sato, T et al., J Virol 68, 1790-6 (1994)), the epitope was never structurally defined. Epitopes that span the monomers of NA and HA may be overlooked due to the use of screening assays that do not retain the quaternary protein structure. For HA, most of the mAbs reported, including those targeting conserved antigenic sites, bind to single HA1/HA2 monomers. Nevertheless, mAbs that bind simultaneously to two HA monomers have occasionally been described (Barbey-Martin, C. et al. Virology 294, 70-4 (2002); Iba, Y. et al., J Virol 88:13 7130-7144 (2014), suggesting that the molecular structure of HA allows antibodies to be generated that bind across the monomer-monomer interface of the trimer.",
                                "The mAbs that span HA monomers are efficient in neutralizing virus in vitro (Barbey-Martin C. et al., 2002, supra; Iba, Y. et al., 2014, supra) and thus are likely to be protective in vivo. The in vivo studies disclosed herein showed that NA-specific mAb CD6 protected mice against severe disease. When given prophylactically, a low dose of 0.5 mg kg\u22121 protected all mice against lethal CA/09-X179A virus challenge. In the therapeutic study, a single dose of 5 mg kg\u22121 or multiple doses of a lower dose (2.5 or 1 mg kg\u22121) protected mice from lethal virus challenge. These findings evidence that the interface of either HA or NA monomers is a target for the development of therapeutic antibodies against influenza.",
                                "The atomic structure of CA/09 NA in complex with CD6 Fab identified 30 amino acids that have contact with antibody. This number of contacts is far greater than those observed for other NA/Fab complexes\u2014mAbs NC10 and NC41 have 14 and 17 amino acid contacts in N9 (Malby, R. L. et al., 1994, supra), respectively, while mAb Mem5 contacts 17 amino acids in N2 (Venkatramani, L. et al. J Mol Biol 356, 651-63 (2006)). With a larger number of contacts between NA and mAb, it might be less likely for single mutations in NA to eliminate mAb binding, even though the antibody avidity may change to some degree. In the case of CD6, it required multiple rounds to select escape mutant viruses. These escape variants bear double mutations N449D/D451G in NA, rather than single amino acid mutation as often observed in mutant selection with other NA mAbs (Wan, H. et al. J Virol 87, 9290-300 (2013); Air, G. M. et al. Virology 145, 237-48 (1985); Webster, R. G. et al. J Virol 61, 2910-6 (1987)). Interestingly, residues 449 and 451, together with residue 95, are present as a cluster and therefore possibly form an important anchor for CD6 binding.",
                                "The epitope targeted by CD6 remains largely conserved, although mutations at some of the residues in CD6 epitope have occurred at a low rate. None of the pH1N1 NA sequences available in GISAID contain both N449D and D451G, the mutations identified in CD6 escape variants. A small proportion of pH1N1 viruses contain the D451G single substitution in NA. This single change in the NA of CA/09 reduced CD6 binding, however additional mutations in the NA might have helped some of these variant viruses to retain sensitivity to CD6, as demonstrated by our analysis with a representative virus BA/12.",
                                "The findings that CD6 inhibited NA cleavage of large molecule fetuin but not the small substrate MU-NANA suggested that this antibody inhibited NA activity by blocking access of substrate to the enzyme active site. This concept is in agreement with the structural observations; there was no distortion of the NA structure in complex with CD6, and although the boundary of the CD6 epitope, formed by the HCDR2 loop, is distant from the NA active site, amino acid contacts for the L chain on the neighboring monomer are in close proximity to the active site. Thus, CD6 is likely to block the active site of the monomer to which the L chain binds, with four CD6 molecules needed to inhibit all NA active sites of a tetramer.",
                                "Another observation that supports a mechanism of steric hindrance is that the size of the CD6 molecule impacts inhibition. In the in vitro assays, CD6 Fab2 inhibited CA/09 NA to a greater degree than CD6 Fab, and the best inhibition was observed with whole CD6 IgG. In the case of the interaction between NA and the whole CD6 molecule, the other Fab arm as well as the Fc region of the antibody may contribute to blocking access of substrate to NA, either by obstructing the active site by its bulk, or by cross-linking adjacent NA tetramers. While this may be important therapeutically, the antigen binding fragments can still be used in diagnostic assays.",
                                "Disclosed herein is the structure of NA subtype N1 in complex with a highly protective mAb that binds an epitope that spans adjacent NA monomers. Without being bound by theory, the large number of interactions between NA and CD6 are likely to stabilize the complex. The apparent need for two amino acid changes in CD6 epitope to enable antibody escape consequently reduces the likelihood of generating CD6-resistant variants. The absence of NA sequences with changes at both 449 and 451 residues give confidence that CD6-resistant viruses are not currently in circulation. These observations show that mAb CD6 is suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic treatment against H1N1 influenza, and is of particular value in face of emerging NA-inhibitor resistant variants. Vaccines and therapeutic antibodies can be developed that target similar epitopes in NAs of other influenza types and subtypes, including those with pandemic potential."

The cells were washed and then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were then incubated with MAbs (1 \u03bcg/ml), followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.). Both incubations were for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. The signal was developed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) as substrate. The reaction was stopped with 1N H2SO4 and OD490 values were read. Expression of NA was confirmed with hyperimmune mouse serum against CA/09 (with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer \u2267320). The signals generated by MAb binding to mutant NAs were normalized to that generated by hyperimmune mouse serum and therefore expressed as relative binding.

Antibodies 4E9 and 1H5 are broadly-reactive with the NA of H1N1 (including seasonal and pandemic H1N1) and H5N1 viruses, with NA residues 273, 338 and 339 being the important contacts (Wan et al., J Virol 87:9290-9300, 2013; Wan et al., Nat Commun 6:6114, 2015).",
                                "The epitope recognized by HF5 is not fully elucidated. In ELISA using CA/09-X179A virus-coated plates, HF5 bound to native virus, but not denatured virus, indicating that HF5 epitope is dependent on the native conformation (FIG. 14A). NI assays suggested that HF5 may bind to an epitope involving residue 369 (see above). The binding of HF5 to various mutant CA/09 NAs transiently expressed on 293T cells was examined. Cell-based ELISA with these mutant NAs clearly demonstrated that an N to K mutation at residue 369 abolished the binding of NA by HF5 (FIG. 1B). This finding confirms that residue 369 is a key contact in the HF5 epitope. In addition, S364N and N397K mutations in NA resulted in complete loss of HF5 binding in cell-based ELISA. Residues 364, 369 and 397 are in close proximity to one another and are clearly important contacts for HF5. The HF5 epitope is therefore distinct from the CD6 epitope as well as the epitope recognized by antibodies 4E9 and 1H5. Thus, the antigenic domains recognized by these four MAbs represent three different epitopes in N1 of pH1N1 virus (FIGS. 14C and D).",

                                "Studies using H6N1CA/09 virus in ELLA demonstrated that HF5 and CD6 are more effective in inhibiting the NA activity of pH1N1 virus than 4E9 and 1H5 (see above). This difference in inhibitory efficacy was also observed with wt CA/09 in ELLA: the median inhibition concentration (IC50) of CD6 and HF5 was <100 ng/ml, while that of 4E9 and 1H5 was >2 \u03bcg/ml (FIG. 15A). The effect of the four MAbs on the growth of wt CA/09 in MDCK cells was compared. Antibody 3A2, which is reactive only to BR/07-like H1N1 viruses, was included as a negative control. In plaque assay, both HF5 and CD6 inhibited CA/09 plaque formation or resulted in smaller plaques when the agar overlay was supplemented with either MAb. Only pinpoint plaques were formed at MAb concentrations \u22671 \u03bcg/ml. When applied at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml, HF5 still efficiently inhibited CA/09 plaque formation, while clear, small plaques were observed in the presence of CD6. The superior inhibitory effect of HF5 was also observed at the lowest concentration of MAb tested: CA/09 plaques were observed at 0.1 \u03bcg/ml of either antibody, but plaques formed in the presence of HF5 were slightly smaller than those formed in the presence of CD6 (FIGS. 15B and 15C).",
                                "In comparison to HF5 and CD6, inhibition of plaque formation by MAbs 4E9 and 1H5 was poor. There was no reduction in plaque size at 0.1 or 0.5 \u03bcg/ml MAb but when the agar overlay was supplemented with \u22671 \u03bcg/ml MAb, both 4E9 and 1H5 reduced the size of CA/09 plaques. Compared to the average size of CA/09 plaques formed in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml of the control antibody 3A2 (2.1 mm), plaques formed in the presence of 4E9 were significantly smaller (p<0.001), with average diameters of 1.6, 1.3, and 1.0 mm at antibody concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed with MAb 1H5 (FIGS. 15B and 15C). Thus, the plaque assays revealed that HF5 and CD6 were more effective than 4E9 and 1H5 in inhibiting CA/09 spread. This result is consistent with the ability of each MAb to inhibit NA activity.",
                                "Since the four MAbs inhibited NA activity and virus spread with different efficiency, it was tested whether the inhibitory potential could be extended to multiple cycles of virus replication. MDCK cells were infected with CA/09 at a MOI=0.001 and maintained in media supplemented with each MAb. HF5 and CD6 inhibited the growth of CA/09 at all of the concentrations tested (1, 5 or 10 \u03bcg/ml), with viral titers that were lower than those observed with the control antibody 3A2 at each of the examined time points (FIG. 15D). The presence of HF5 and CD6 retarded virus growth: peak viral titers were not attained in the presence of these MAbs until 48 h, when most of the cells had died, whereas peak titers were measured at 36 h in the presence of control MAb 3A2. The peak titers in control culture supernatants were significantly (\u02dc100-fold, p<0.01 or 0.001) higher than in supernatants containing HF5 and CD6. The absence of a dose-dependent effect with HF5 and CD6 suggests that maximal inhibition was obtained at the lowest concentration examined, 1 \u03bcg/ml. This is consistent with the fact that this concentration is \u02dc20-50 times greater than the IC50 of the two antibodies measured by ELLA.",
                                "In contrast, mAbs 4E9 and 1H5 did not inhibit virus growth at any of the concentrations tested (except for 10 \u03bcg/ml at 10 h p.i.), as reflected by viral titers similar to those detected in the presence of control antibody 3A2. This is also consistent with the fact that these two antibodies failed to effectively inhibit the NA activity of CA/09.",

CD6 and two N1 broadly-reactive antibodies, 1H5 and 3H10, all protected mice against lethal challenge with a vaccine candidate virus CA/09-X179A (Wan et al., J Virol 87:9290-9300, 2013, and data presented above), although the latter two MAbs required higher doses than CD6 to achieve full protection.

HF5 was more effective than CD6, as either 1 or 5 mg/kg of HF5 resulted in maximum protection (\u02dc90% survival), whereas a 5 mg/kg dose of CD6 protected all mice from death, and 1 mg/kg of CD6 resulted in 25% survival. No mice that received 0.2 mg/kg of antibody survived. Consistent with the in vitro observations, higher doses of antibodies 4E9 and 1H5 were needed to protect against lethal wt CA/09 infection. 4E9 did not protect any mice from death at 5 mg/kg, while 1H5 protected \u02dc40% of mice. At 10 and 15 mg/kg, 4E9 resulted in partial protection (\u02dc20% and 50%), but was not as effective as 1H5, which protected \u02dc60% and \u02dc80% of mice (FIGS. 16J and 16M). All mice in the control groups (injected with antibody 3A2 at 5 or 15 mg/kg) died or had to be euthanized within 9-10 days p.c. In all groups, mice began to lose weight on day 3 p.c.; however, mice that received 1 or 5 mg/kg of HF5, or 5 mg/kg of CD6, lost less weight than other groups (FIGS. 16B, 16E, 16H, 15K and 16N).",
                                "To determine whether MAb treatment reduced viral load in mice, three animals from each group were sacrificed on days 6 and 8 p.c. (and also on days 10, 12 for mice treated with HF5 and CD6 at 5 mg/kg, or with 4E9 and 1H5 at 15 mg/kg), and viral load in the lungs was measured (FIGS. 16C, 16F, 16I, 16L and 16O). High viral titers were detected in all groups of mice on days 6 and 8 p.c. For mice that received the lowest dose of either HF5 or CD6 (0.2 mg/kg), the lung viral titers were similar to those detected in the control group (mice received 5 mg/kg of MAb 3A2). Increasing the HF5 and CD6 doses to 1 or 5 mg/kg resulted in \u02dc10-fold reduction in lung viral titers, except that a more dramatic reduction (\u02dc300-fold) was observed on day 8 p.c. in mice that received 5 mg/kg of CD6. As the virus was not cleared by day 8 p.c., additional mice in the 5 mg/kg groups were examined for viral titers on days 10 and 12 p.c. Viral titers were below the detection limit on both days in mice treated with CD6. Virus took longer time to clear from the lungs of mice treated with HF5; there was a \u02dc100-fold reduction in viral titers on day 10 p.c. compared to day 8 p.c., but it was not until day 12 p.c. that the viral load was reduced to below the detection limit (FIG. 16I). For mice that received MAb 4E9 or 1H5, a reduction of viral load was evident in the group given 15 mg/kg antibody; at this dose, virus was cleared by day 12 in mice treated with 4E9, and by day 10 in those treated with 1H5 (FIG. 16O). Taken together, these results indicate that NA antibodies are able to protect mice from challenge with a lethal dose of a more virulent virus, and that the effective dose reflects in vitro functional properties of the MAbs.",
                                "To confirm that the differences in protection were not due to differences in absorption of the tested MAbs into the circulatory system, we measured the NI titers in mouse sera after i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg of each MAb. Table 6 demonstrates the MAbs were effectively absorbed into the circulatory system.",
                                "High NI titers were measured against the homologous NA on day 1 after administration of the MAbs. These levels were maintained throughout the testing period for CD6 and HF5, but serum NI titers declined at later time points for mice treated with MAbs 4E9 and 1H5 (8-16 fold reduction compared to titers on day 1). These data confirm that differences in MAb protective efficacy were likely due to differences in functional attributes of the MAbs and not an effect of MAb absorption.",

After challenge with wt CA/09, each antibody was administered i.p. at doses of 5 (HF5 and CD6) or 10 mg/kg (1H5) once (on day 1 p.c.), twice (on days 1 and 5 p.c.), or three times (on days 1, 2 and 3 p.c.). As shown in FIG. 17 (see FIGS. 17A, 17D, 17G), all treatments with HF5 protected \u226775% of the challenged mice from death. For antibody CD6, 50% of mice that received two or three doses survived the challenge, while a single 5 mg/kg dose only protected 25% of the mice. Administration of 1H5 did not result in significant protection; only 1 out of the 8 mice that received three 10 mg/kg doses of this antibody survived.",
                                "Mice in all groups began to lose weight on day 3 p.c. (FIGS. 17B, 17E and 17H), and the surviving mice began gaining weight by days 9 to 11 p.c. The HF5 treated mice generally lost less weight than the CD6 treated ones: the maximum weight loss observed in HF5 treated mice was \u02dc17%, while the maximum weight loss observed in CD6 treated mice was 24% (FIG. 17B).",
                                "Similar to the observation in prophylactic study, high viral titers were measured in the lungs of mice on days 6 and 8 p.c. in all groups, although the titers in lungs of mice that received HF5 or CD6 were slightly lower than in the control group (mice received antibody 3A2) (see FIGS. 17C, 17F and 17I). To further investigate virus clearance in mice treated with each MAb, we measured viral load at later time points in lungs of mice that received three doses (on days 1, 3 and 5 p.c.) of HF5 or CD6. By day 10, virus was cleared in mice that received HF5, while virus in CD6 treated mice did not clear until day 12 p.c.",

                                "To further evaluate the potential of MAbs HF5 and CD6 as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, these two MAbs were examined to see if they selected escape mutants of CA/09 in vivo. Mouse lungs collected on days 6, 8 and 10 p.c. from the prophylactic (administration of 5 mg/kg of antibody 12 h before challenge with wt CA/09) and therapeutic (three doses administered at 5 mg/kg on days 1, 2 and 3 p.c. following challenge with wt CA/09) studies were tested for the presence of escape mutants. This was examined by isolating viral plaques from supernatants of lung homogenates with MAb (2 \u03bcg/ml) in the agar overlay. Despite the presence of antibody HF5 in the agar overlay, clear, big plaques were observed with lung samples from mice treated with HF5 either prophylactically or therapeutically (FIG. 18A), indicating that escape mutants of CA/09 had emerged in both treatments. However, in the presence of CD6, no plaques that were bigger than those of wt CA/09 were observed with lung supernatants from CD6 treated mice, demonstrating the absence of escape mutants that are resistant to the inhibition by CD6. HF5-selected mutant viruses were expanded by picking plaques and culturing in eggs. Sequencing of the mutant viruses revealed S364N or N397K mutation in the NA of viruses selected in the prophylactic treatment, and S364N mutation in the NA of mutant viruses from the therapeutic treatment. wt CA/09 virus that was used for challenge (egg passage 6/MDCK passage 1) was grown in eggs for the same amount of time (48 h) as virus plaques isolated from the lungs of MAb-treated mice; no NA sequence change was detected in the resultant virus (egg passage 7/MDCK passage 1), confirming that the mutations observed in the NA of HF5 escape mutants were not the result of passaging the virus in eggs.",
                                "The NA activity of the mutant viruses, especially the virus with N397K mutation in the NA, was less than that of wt CA/09 when measured using either a small substrate MU-NANA (FIG. 18B) or large substrate fetuin (FIG. 18C). NI assays were performed to confirm the resistance of mutant viruses (with S364N and N397K in the NA, respectively) to antibody HF5; while HF5 effectively inhibited wt CA/09 NA, it failed to inhibit either mutant virus (FIG. 18D). This is consistent with the observation in cell-based ELISA, which indicates that S364N and N397K mutations result in a dramatic reduction in the binding of HF5 to NA (FIG. 14A). As shown in FIG. 18D, both of the mutant viruses retain sensitivity to inhibition by CD6.",
                                "Thus, the in vitro properties of four NA-specific MAbs, HF5, CD6, 4E9 and 1H5, and test the efficacy of these MAbs in vivo against wt pH1N1 virus CA/09. It is clear that the epitopes recognized by HF5, CD6 and group B MAbs (e.g., 4E9 and 1H5) are different from each other, although we cannot exclude that these epitopes may overlap to some extent. The CD6 epitope and the epitope recognized by group B MAbs are located relatively lateral in the NA head in relation to the enzyme active site (see above). Residues 364, 369 and 397, identified in the present study to be critical for the binding by MAb HF5, are located in a region of a polypeptide chain which encircles the enzyme active site pocket. Therefore, the HF5 epitope is likely at closer proximity to the NA active center than epitopes recognized by CD6 as well as 4E9 and 1H5.",
                                "The in vitro properties of these NA MAbs correspond to the relative distance of the epitopes to the NA active center. For instance, in the lectin-based NI assay, HF5 inhibited CA/09 NA more efficiently than did the other three MAbs. HF5 also inhibited plaque formation and the growth kinetics of CA/09 virus to a greater extent than CD6 and the group B antibodies. HF5 exhibited higher efficacy than 4E9 and 1H5, and even CD6, in protecting mice from lethal challenge with CA/09. These findings indicated that for NA MAbs, the in vitro properties (reduction in plaque size, inhibition of virus growth in cell culture and inhibition of NA activity as measured with ELLA) are generally consistent with each other, and correlate with the in vivo effectiveness in protecting against influenza virus.",
                                "When administered at effective doses (e.g., \u22671 mg/kg prophylactically or 5 mg/kg therapeutically), HF5 appeared to be a suitable treatment. However, it rapidly selected escape mutants of CA/09 virus in vivo, which diminishes its potential to serve as a therapeutic against pH1N1 virus infection. In fact, the N397K mutation, detected in the NA of escape mutants from the HF5 treated mice, has occurred in the current circulating pH1N1 viruses (Takashita et al., Euro Surveill 19, November to December 2013; Takashita et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 59:2607-2617). In addition, the N369K mutation, which abolishes the binding of HF5 to CA/09 NA, was selected soon after the introduction of pH1N1 virus into the human population and by 2011 was present in \u226799% of the circulating strains (Hurt et al., J Infect Dis 206:148-157, 2012). This suggests that the HF5 epitope is probably also targeted by the human NA-specific antibodies, which resulted in antigenic drift of this epitope. The prevalence of N369K, and to a lesser extent, N397K mutations in circulating pH1N1 viruses (Okomo-Adhiambo et al., Emerg Infect Dis 21:136-141, 2015) indicate that antibodies elicited against the HF5 epitope in humans no longer bind to the majority of circulating pH1N1 viruses. Thus, although MAb HF5 is more effective in inhibiting NA of the prototype pH1N1 virus CA/09, it is not a suitable candidate for further development as a therapeutic.",
                                "It was interesting to find that mutant viruses with S364N and N397K, but not N369K mutation in the NA, were selected by MAb HF5 in mice. This phenomenon was also noted for N9-specific MAb NC41: when MAbs that bind N9 were used to select escape variants, mutations at residue 369 were selected by some MAbs, but not by NC41, even though x-ray crystallography shows that both heavy and light chains of the antibody have contact with amino acid 369 (Air et al., J Virol 64:5797-5803, 1990). It is likely that the amino acid changes selected are unique to each antibody. In addition, the selective pressure exerted by human immune response (elicited by either natural infection or vaccination) might be different from that by mouse MAb HF5, which may result in different amino acid mutations in the NA. However, the reasons for selecting specific mutations are likely to be complex and as these examples show, are sometimes not easily predicted.",
                                "In contrast to various mutations within the HF5 epitope that are observed in the NA of circulating pH1N1 viruses, phylogenetic analysis shows that the CD6 epitope has remained largely conserved. The N449D/D451G double mutation in CA/09 NA, which was selected in vitro (Wan et al., Nat Commun 6:6114, 2015), has not been identified in natural pH1N1 viruses so far, highlighting the potential of antibody CD6 to serve as an ideal target for antiviral development. It is noteworthy that the D to G mutation at residue 451, one of the important contacts in the CD6 epitope, has been detected in some circulating pH1N1 strains. However, it does not appear to affect the inhibition by CD6, as additional amino acid mutations in the NA may help these strains to retain the sensitivity to CD6 (see above). Taken these into consideration, antibody CD6 is more ideal than HF5 for serving as an antiviral, even though it is slightly less effective than HF5 in inhibiting CA/09 NA activity.",
                                "MAb CD6 protected all mice after a single dose of 1 mg/kg administered prophylactically or a single dose of 5 mg/kg administered therapeutically. High doses (15 mg/kg) of the broadly-reactive group B MAbs 1H5 and 3H10 also provided full protection against lethal challenge with this virus. In the present study, however, group B MAb 4E9 failed to result in similar protective efficacy against the wt CA/09, and a higher dose of CD6 was needed to obtain optimal protection. These data reflect a difference in virulence of wt CA/09 and CA/09-X179A in the DBA/2 mouse model. The more stringent conditions imposed by using the more virulent virus in the mouse model is an important step toward development of antivirals.",
                                "Antibodies vary in their properties, including specificity, affinity and the ability to neutralize/inhibit virus. The efficacy of NA-specific MAbs is largely due to reduced release of newly formed virus particles from infected cells although clearance of virus-infected cells through complement or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity mechanisms may also contribute to their effectiveness. The results disclosed herein suggest that the rate at which virus replication is reduced by NA-specific MAbs could depend on the virus strain. At high doses (\u22672.5 mg/kg), prophylactic treatment with MAb CD6 cleared CA/09-X179A vaccine virus from the lungs of mice by day 3 p.c., however the same MAb applied at a higher dose (5 mg/kg) did not result in clearance of the more virulent wt CA/09 until after day 10 p.c. Regardless of initial effectiveness, antibodies that select escape variants may quickly become obsolete as antigenic drift variants become predominant in the circulating virus population. NA antibodies such as CD6 that bind to conserved antigenic domains and also have inhibitory properties are more likely to be effective against a broad range of circulating viruses and are less likely to select escape variants. A mixture of MAbs with specificity for different NA epitopes, or a mixture of NA- and HA-specific MAbs, can be used in combination to further minimize the generation of escape mutants and improve treatment.",
