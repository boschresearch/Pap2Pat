# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to novel binding interactions and to identifying a compound for use in therapy in a mammal, including in a human. In particular the compound may be for use in cancer therapy or in therapy of an autoimmune disease or inflammatory condition. Methods are provided for identifying novel S100A9 ligands, and agents that interact with S100A9 are also disclosed. The present invention also provides such ligands and agents including an antibody.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

S100A9, also known as calgranulin B and myeloid related protein-14 (MRP-14), is a calcium- and zinc-binding protein that belongs to the S 100 protein family. S100A9 is highly expressed by the myeloid cell lineage and is found in the extracellular milieu during inflammatory conditions. S100A9 forms heterodimers with S100A8, another member of the S100 family. However, S100A9 may also form monomers which executes specific functions. Human S100A9 has a molecular mass of about 13 kDa and is composed of 114 amino acid residues.

The S100A8/A9 protein can bind to endothelium through the interaction of S100A9 with heparan sulphate proteoglycans or of the S100A8/A9 complex with carboxylated N-glycans exclusively expressed by endothelial cells after inflammatory activation. Another receptor that binds different S 100 proteins is the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Direct binding to RAGE has so far been demonstrated for S100A12, S100B, S100A1, and S100P. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules. RAGE consists of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane spanning domain, and a highly charged cytosolic tail. RAGE signaling contributes to the activation of central cellular pathways which involve p38 or p44/42 MAP kinases, Cdc42/Rac, and NF-κB signaling components, thereby influencing features like cell survival, cell motility, and inflammatory response.

Binding of ligands to the RAGE receptor initiates cellular signals that activate NF-κB, which results in transcription of proinflammatory factors. The mammalian TOLL-like receptors (TLR) are receptors that recognize molecular patterns of pathogens. After the engagement of a pathogenic pattern ligand to TLR, recruitment of adaptor proteins, the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by the receptor-driven signaling cascade. It has been proposed that RAGE and TLR's use similar mechanisms which results in inflammatory reactions.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The inventors have characterized novel binding interactions of S100A9, i.e. a binding interaction with RAGE and a binding interaction with TLR4. They have also characterized the inhibition of these interactions by a compound which is effective in therapy, and thus developed screening methods to allow identification of compounds for therapy. The inventors have further shown that it is preferable for screening methods using S100A9 to be carried out in the presence of calcium and zinc ions.

Accordingly, the invention provides a method of identifying a compound for use in therapy which modulates the interaction of S100A9 with a ligand comprising:


- - (i) determining whether a candidate compound is capable of
    modulating the interaction of S100A9 with RAGE or the interaction of
    S100A9 with a TLR (Toll like receptor), or
  - (ii) determining whether a candidate compound is capable of binding
    to S100A9 in a manner which disrupts binding of S100A9 with RAGE or
    the binding of S100A9 with a TLR,  
    to thereby identify whether the compound may be used in therapy,
    wherein optionally the method is carried out in the presence of
    calcium and zinc ions.

The invention also provides an antibody that inhibits the interactions that have been characterized.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a method for identifying compounds for use in therapy, in particular compound for use in cancer therapy or immunotherapy. The compounds may be for use in therapy of autoimmune disease or an inflammatory condition. Typically the compounds may be used to treat an individual that has, or is at risk of having, a condition that can be prevented or treated by modulation of the immune system. The condition may be an autoimmune disease, such as type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. In one embodiment the condition is cancer. The individual to be treated in the therapy is typically a mammal, and preferably a human. Further the inventors have carried out the binding assays in conditions under which only S100A9 binds ligand strongly, and other S100 proteins do not, and thus preferred methods of the invention are based on binding assays carried out under such conditions.

The method of the invention identifies therapeutic compounds based on their ability to modulate the interaction between S100A9 and a ligand of S100A9, or on their ability to bind S100A9 in a manner which would disrupt binding of S100A9 with a ligand. The ligand is typically RAGE or a TLR (Toll like receptor). The TLR is preferably TLR4, but may be any TLR which binds S100A9, such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12 or TLR13.

The method may be based on any suitable assay. The assay may measure or detect any of the physical properties mentioned herein, and a compound may be selected based on any such physical property. As can be seen in the Examples the inventors have characterized the properties of a therapeutically effective compound (termed compound A in the Examples), and thus the assay may determine whether a candidate compound has a relevant physical property which is the same or similar to the compound A.

Typically the method comprises determining whether a candidate compound is able to affect the binding of S100A9 and a ligand. The candidate compound may bind to S100A9 and cause a change in the conformation of S100A9, for example by inhibiting the binding of calcium or zinc to S100A9. Thus the assay may comprise providing a candidate compound to S100A9 and the ligand and determining whether the binding of S100A9 to the ligand has been affected. The assay may comprise allowing the candidate compound to bind S100A9 and then determining whether the binding would affect the binding of S100A9 to RAGE or a TLR, for example by testing whether the candidate compound binds S100A9 at the same site as RAGE or a TLR.

In a preferred embodiment the method comprises identifying a compound that modulates the interaction of S100A9 and a ligand. The term “modulate” as used herein refers to both upregulating (i.e. activation or stimulation, e.g. by agonizing or potentiating) and downregulation (i.e. inhibition or suppression, e.g. by antagonizing, decreasing or inhibiting) of an activity. The compound may be used to modulate the immune response in vivo.

In the method S100A9 and/or the ligand and/or the compound are preferably used in isolated form or substantially isolated form. Typically they are not present in or on the surface of cells and/or other proteins are not present. Typically less than 10, such as less than 5 or less than 3 other types of protein are present. Preferably calcium and zinc ions are present. In one embodiment 0.1 to 5 mM calcium ions, such as 0.5 to 2 mM calcium ions or about 1mM calcium ions and/or 1 to 100 uM zinc ions, such as 5 to 50 uM zinc ions or about 10 uM zinc ions are present. In the method S100A9 or the ligand may be immobilized to a solid surface, and preferably the ligand is immobilized. Immobilisation may be achieved by any suitable means, for example by amine coupling. The solid surface may be one which is arranged so that changes in its surface characteristics are detected by surface plasma resonance. The immobilized molecule should still be capable of binding to S100A9 (where a ligand is immobilized) or the ligand (where S100A9 is immobilized).

In the method the binding of S100A9 and ligand is typically measured over a certain time period, for example over 10 to 12000 or 20 to 6000 or 60 to 500 seconds, which may allow the kinetics of the binding to be observed, and thus allow compounds to be selected based on the kinetics of binding. In addition the method may comprise measurement of the effects of different amounts/concentrations of the compound, thus allowing selection of compounds which have a dose-dependent effect.

The method of the invention preferably measures and/or selects a compound based on one or more of the following characteristics:


- - whether there is a 1:1 binding between the compound and S100A9 or
    ligand, for example by analysis of the effect of different
    concentrations of the compound,
  - the IC50 of the compound, and preferably whether the IC50 is from 1
    nM to 200 uM, for example from 10 nM to 150 um, 0.5 uM to 100 uM or
    20 to 70 uM,
  - the effect of the compound on the on-rate and/or off-rate of S100A9
    and ligand, or
  - the level of decrease of binding of S100A9 and ligand,
  - whether the compound binds to S100A9 or ligand under physiological
    (in vivo) conditions,
  - whether the binding is specific,
  - whether the binding is reversible or irreversible, or
  - whether the compound causes a change in the structure of S100A9 or
    ligand.

In one embodiment at least 100, such as at least 1000, or at least 10,000 candidate compounds are tested. At least 1, 10, 50, 100 or more or all of the compounds that are tested preferably have one or more of the following characteristics:


- - they are not proteins or nucleic acids,
  - they are not lipids,
  - they are not toxic to mammals or humans,
  - they are soluble in water,
  - their structure is characterized or uncharacterized,
  - they are from a library of compounds which may, for example, have
    been synthesized together,
  - they are small organic molecules (typically containing carbon,
    hydrogen and generally also oxygen), and preferably having a
    relative molecular weight of at least 100, and less than 1000, such
    as a relative molecular weight of less than 600.

In a preferred embodiment the candidate compounds comprise a suitable structural element such as a 1,3-diketo functional group or a carboxylic acid functional group.

In one embodiment of the method less than 5%, for example less than 10% or less than 15% of the compounds which are tested are selected.

Forms/Variants of S100A9 or Ligand that may be used in the Method

Any suitable form of S100A9 or ligand may be used in the method. Thus they may used in the form of homologues and/or fragments of naturally occurring forms. The term “homologues and/or fragments” includes fragments of homologues of the relevant molecule. Homologues and/or fragments of any of the specific sequences disclosed herein may be used or of any naturally occurring isoform (for example of any mammalian species). Preferably a homologue and/or fragment of a human S100A9 or ligand is used. The homologue and/or fragment are termed “variant” in the discussion below.

The variant may be capable of complementing one or more activities of the naturally occurring molecule. Preferably the variant is capable of binding to S100A9 (if it is a variant of the ligand) or to the ligand (if it is a variant of S100A9). The variant polypeptide may comprise sequence which is homologous to all or part of S100A9 or the ligand. Thus the variant may be a fusion protein. The variant thus generally comprises at least the binding site of S100A9 or the ligand.

In a preferred embodiment the variant comprises the extracellular domain of the ligand. In the case where the variant is a variant of RAGE preferably at least 1, 2 or 3 of the immunoglobulin domains (or homologues of the domains) of RAGE are present in the variant. A preferred RAGE variant is described in the Examples and comprises amino acids 1 to 344 of human RAGE fused to the Fc region of human IgG1. In the case where the variant is a variant of S100A9 preferably at least the N-terminus helix 4 and linker region (or homologues of helix 4 and/or the linker region) are present in the variant and/or preferably at least the two histidine amino acids of helix 4 are present in the variant (which are important in binding zinc) and/or preferably the five histidines in the C terminus which are important in zinc coordination/binding are present in the variant and/or preferably the variant is capable of binding zinc.

In one embodiment the form of S100A9 or ligand which is used binds an antibody that binds the naturally occurring form. In the case of RAGE the form which is used may bind to MAB 11451 that is available from R & D Systems.

The variant is typically at least 100 amino acids long, such as at least 200 amino acids long, up to, for example, 2000 amino acid in length.

The forms of S100A9 and/or ligand may be modified, e.g. post-translationally modified. For example, they may be glycosylated or comprise modified amino acid residues. The ligand is preferably glycosylated, for example in a glycosylated form which is obtainable by expression in a mammalian (preferably human) cell.

In general use of other S100 naturally occurring proteins apart from S100A9 is not included in the method of the invention.

Any suitable monomer/dimer/multimer form of S100A9 or ligand may be used. S100A9 may be used in monomer, dimer or multimer form. It is preferably used in dimer form (i.e. comprising two S100A9 proteins). The ligand may be used in monomer or dimer form. RAGE is preferably used in dimer form (comprising two RAGE proteins).

Expressed S100A9 proteins or ligands (including fragments and homologues) can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Protein refolding steps can be used, as necessary, in completing configuration of the mature protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps.

Any polypeptides mentioned herein may be a naturally purified product, or a product of chemical synthetic procedures, or produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (for example, by bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells in culture). Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be post-translationally modified and in particular they may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated.

### Homologues

Homologues of sequences are referred to herein. Such homologues typically have at least 20% homology, preferably at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97% or at least 99% homology, for example over a region of at least 15, 20, 30, 100 more contiguous amino acids or over the length of the entire molecule. In a preferred embodiment at least 30% homology is present over the entire length of the molecule and/or at least 50% homology is present over at least 30 amino acids. The homology may be calculated on the basis of amino acid identity (sometimes referred to as “hard homology”).

For example the UWGCG Package provides the BESTFIT program which can be used to calculate homology (for example used on its default settings) (Devereux et al (1984) Nucleic Acids Research 12, p 387-395). The PILEUP and BLAST algorithms can be used to calculate homology or line up sequences (such as identifying equivalent or corresponding sequences (typically on their default settings), for example as described in Altschul S. F. (1993) J Mol Evol 36:290-300; Altschul, S, F et al (1990) J Mol Biol 215:403-10.

Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pair (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence that either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighbourhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighbourhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Extensions for the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAST program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915-10919) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=4, and a comparison of both strands.

The BLAST algorithm performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences; see e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5787. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a sequence is considered similar to another sequence if the smallest sum probability in comparison of the first sequence to the second sequence is less than about 1, preferably less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.

The homologous sequence typically differs by less than 5, 10, 20 or 50 mutations (which may be substitutions, deletions or insertions of nucleotide or amino acids). These mutation may be measured across any of the regions mentioned above in relation to calculating homology. The substitutions are preferably conservative substitutions. These are defined according to the following Table. Amino acids in the same block in the second column and preferably in the same line in the third column may be substituted for each other:

### Further Testing of the Identified Compound

A compound identified by the above method (which is non-cellular and not in vivo) may be further tested to determine whether it modulates the immune response, and preferably whether it decreases the immune response. Compounds may be selected if they are found to modulate the immune response. Any suitable cell based assay or animal model assay may be used. Preferably the assay will comprise monocytes which express S100A9, and will test whether the compound is able to modulate the growth or activity of such monocytes. The assay may determine whether the compound modulates S100A9 expression on the monocytes. The assay may determine whether the compound binds to a CD11b+CD14+ population of cells and/or whether the compound modulates (for example decreases) the level or activity of such cells.

Thus the compound may be contacted with a monocyte (such as a CD11b+CD14+ monocyte) to determine whether the compound modulates the growth or activity of the moncyte.

The assay may be in the form of a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), for example one comprising monocytes which have been stimulated with TOLL.

The compound may be tested to determine whether it modulates (for example increases or decreases the numbers of) monocytes (for example dendritic cells) in an animal model and/or for therapeutic efficacy in an animal model. The animal model may be of any of the conditions mentioned herein, such as cancer, autoimmune disease or an inflammatory condition. The animal is preferably a rodent, such as a mouse or rat.

Thus the compound may be administered to an animal and a sample of containing monocytes may be taken from the animal to determine whether the compound causes a decrease in the number or activity of monocytes in the animal. In another embodiment the compound may be administered to an animal with a cancer or autoimmune disease, or an animal at risk of having cancer or an autoimmune disease, and whether or not the compound treats or prevents the autoimmune disease is determined.

### The Antibody of the Invention

The Examples describe antibody 43/8 which is a specific modulator of S100A9 capable of inhibiting its interaction with TLR4 and RAGE. Antibody 43/8 was generated by immunizing S100A9 null mice with recombinant S100A9. The antibody recognizes a unique epitope on the S100A9 molecule. This epitope overlaps with the region of the molecule that can interact with TLR4 and RAGE. Furthermore, the interaction of 43/8 with S100A9 was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ in the S100A9 protein. 43/8 antibody was capable of stimulating TNFα production in human monocytes. Furthermore, the antibody was able to induce expression of an NFκB reporter gene in a cell line expressing S100A9. Thus, an antibody with specificity to the same epitope as that of proinflammatory mediators (TLR4 and RAGE) is capable of binding membrane bound S100A9 and thereby transmitting a signal across the plasma membrane.

The invention accordingly provides an antibody that specifically binds to an epitope on S100A9, which includes any species of S100A9, such as human S100A9 (for example as defined by SEQ ID NO:1). The epitope is preferably one which is present in the region of S100A9 that binds to TLR4 and/or RAGE, so that for example one or more amino acids of the epitope bind to (or contact) TLR4 and/or RAGE during binding with these molecules. The epitope may be one which is not accessible to a labeling agent when S100A9 is bound to TLR4 and/or RAGE, for example an iodination agent (or at least one amino acid of the epitope is not accessible to a labeling agent when S100A9 is bound to TLR4 and/or RAGE).

The antibody may bind to an epitope which is bound by antibody 43/8 defined in the Examples. Antibody 43/8 is defined with reference to having variable chains shown by SEQ ID NO's 18 and 20. In one embodiment the antibody of the invention comprises variable chains that have sequence:


- - (a) as shown in SEQ ID NO:18 and/or shown in SEQ ID NO:20, or
  - (b) which is homologous to sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:18 and/or
    shown in SEQ ID NO:20, or
  - (c) which is a fragment of (a) or (b).

The antibody is preferably capable of inhibiting the binding of S100A9 to TLR4 and/or RAGE, and thus typically the presence of the antibody will reduce the level of binding between S100A9 and TLR4 and/or RAGE if these molecules are contacted with S100A9. Such an inhibition may be in accordance with the data described in Examples and Figures.

The antibody may bind human and/or murine S100A8, A100A9 and/or S100A8/S100A9 complexes. Typically binding of antibody to S100A9 is dependent on the presence of zinc and/or calcium ions.

A preferred antibody is capable of binding to monocytes, such as human and/or murine monocytes. The antibody may be capable of stimulating such cells, for example to produce TNFα. Thus the antibody may be able to induce a transmembrane signal in such cells, for example one which leads to a pro-inflammatory response.

The antibody of the invention recognizes an epitope which is not recognized by known antibodies. In order to generate such an antibodies S100A9 was used to immunize a S100A9 null mouse. In one embodiment the antibody is obtainable by immunization of a mammal which lacks S100A9. Preferably such a mammal is a rodent, such as a mouse.

In one embodiment the antibody of the invention is identifiable by the screening method of the invention, and thus may have any of the characteristics mentioned above which are used as the basis for identifying therapeutic compounds.

The antibody of the invention is therapeutically useful, and may be administered to patients (preferably human patients) to prevent or treat conditions that can be treated or ameliorated by modulation of the immune system. Suitable conditions include any of the general or specific conditions mentioned herein (i.e. which can prevented or treated by compounds identified in the screening method described herein).

The antibodies of the invention are also useful in purification, isolation or screening methods involving immunoprecipitation techniques.

As mentioned above the antibodies recognise specific epitopes. An antibody, “specifically binds” to an epitope when it binds with preferential or high affinity to the epitope for which it is specific but does substantially bind not bind or binds with only low affinity to other antibody. In one embodiment the antibody does not bind to a variant epitope sequence which has less than 50% homology to the epitope recognised by the epitope. In one embodiment the antibody only binds human S100A9, and does not bind any other S100 proteins and/or does not bind S100A9 of other species. In a preferred embodiment the antibody binds to the S100A8/S100A9 complexes, but has minimal affinity to other molecules.

A variety of protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays to determine the specific binding capability of an antibody are well known in the art (see for example Maddox et al, J. Exp. Med. 158, 1211-1226, 1993). Such immunoassays typically involve the formation of complexes between the specific protein and its antibody and the measurement of complex formation.

For the purposes of this invention, the term “antibody”, unless specified to the contrary, includes fragments which bind to the relevant epitope. Such fragments include Fv, F(ab′) and F(ab′)2 fragments, as well as single chain antibodies. Furthermore, the antibodies and fragment thereof may be chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies or humanised antibodies. The antibodies may be of any species, but are preferably human or mice antibodies. The antibody may be polyclonal, but is preferably monoclonal. The antibody is preferably an IgG antibody, but may be an IgM or IgE antibody.

Antibodies of the invention can be produced by any suitable method. Means for preparing and characterising antibodies are well known in the art, see for example Harlow and Lane (1988) “Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual”, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. For example, an antibody may be produced by raising antibody in a host animal against the whole polypeptide or a fragment thereof, for example an antigenic epitope thereof, herein after the “immunogen”. The fragment may be any of the fragments mentioned herein (typically at least 10 or at least 15 amino acids long).

A method for producing a polyclonal antibody comprises immunising a suitable host animal, for example an experimental animal, with the immunogen and isolating immunoglobulins from the animal's serum. The animal may therefore be inoculated with the immunogen, blood subsequently removed from the animal and the IgG fraction purified.

A method for producing a monoclonal antibody comprises immortalising cells which produce the desired antibody. Hybridoma cells may be produced by fusing spleen cells from an inoculated experimental animal with tumour cells (Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256, 495-497).

An immortalized cell producing the desired antibody may be selected by a conventional procedure. The hybridomas may be grown in culture or injected intraperitoneally for formation of ascites fluid or into the blood stream of an allogenic host or immunocompromised host. Human antibody may be prepared by in vitro immunisation of human lymphocytes, followed by transformation of the lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus.

For the production of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the experimental animal is suitably a goat, rabbit, rat, mouse, guinea pig, chicken, sheep or horse. As mentioned above, such an animal preferably does not express S100A9. If desired, the immunogen may be administered as a conjugate in which the immunogen is coupled, for example via a side chain of one of the amino acid residues, to a suitable carrier. The carrier molecule is typically a physiologically acceptable carrier. The antibody obtained may be isolated and, if desired, purified.

The antibody of the invention may be present in a substantially isolated form. It may be mixed with carriers or diluents which will not interfere with its intended use and still be regarded as substantially isolated. It may also be in a substantially purified form, in which case it will generally comprise at least 90%, e.g. at least 95%, 98% or 99%, of the protein or dry mass of the preparation.

### Administration

Compounds identified by the method of the invention or the antibody of the invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition may be used in clinical treatment of diseases resulting from autoimmunity such as multiple sclerosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis and, furthermore, diseases where pathologic inflammation plays a major role, such as asthma, atherosclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. More particularly, it may be used for the treatment of, for example, multiple sclerosis and its manifestations. The pharmaceutical composition may be used in the treatment of cancer.

The formulation will depend upon factors such as the nature of the substance and the condition to be treated. Any such substance may be administered in a variety of dosage forms. It may be administered orally (e.g. as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules), parenterally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, intrasternally, transdermally or by infusion techniques. The substance may also be administered as suppositories. A physician will be able to determine the required route of administration for each particular patient.

Typically the substance is formulated for use with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The pharmaceutical carrier or diluent may be, for example, an isotonic solution. For example, solid oral forms may contain, together with the active compound, diluents, e.g. lactose, dextrose, saccharose, cellulose, corn starch or potato starch; lubricants, e.g. silica, talc, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycols; binding agents; e.g. starches, arabic gums, gelatin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone; disaggregating agents, e.g. starch, alginic acid, alginates or sodium starch glycolate; effervescing mixtures; dyestuffs; sweeteners; wetting agents, such as lecithin, polysorbates, laurylsulphates; and, in general, non-toxic and pharmacologically inactive substances used in pharmaceutical formulations. Such pharmaceutical preparations may be manufactured in known manner, for example, by means of mixing, granulating, tabletting, sugar-coating, or film coating processes.

Liquid dispersions for oral administration may be syrups, emulsions and suspensions. The syrups may contain as carriers, for example, saccharose or saccharose with glycerine and/or mannitol and/or sorbitol.

Suspensions and emulsions may contain as carrier, for example a natural gum, agar, sodium alginate, pectin, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, or polyvinyl alcohol. The suspensions or solutions for intramuscular injections may contain, together with the active compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g. sterile water, olive oil, ethyl oleate, glycols, e.g. propylene glycol, and if desired, a suitable amount of lidocaine hydrochloride.

Solutions for intravenous or infusions may contain as carrier, for example, sterile water or preferably they may be in the form of sterile, aqueous, isotonic saline solutions.

A therapeutically effective non-toxic amount of substance is administered, typically to a patient (preferably a human patient) in need thereof. The dose may be determined according to various parameters, especially according to the substance used; the age, weight and condition of the patient to be treated; the route of administration; and the required regimen. Again, a physician will be able to determine the required route of administration and dosage for any particular patient. A typical daily dose is from about 0.001 to 50 mg per kg, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of body weight, according to the activity of the specific inhibitor, the age, weight and conditions of the subject to be treated, the type and severity of the disease and the frequency and route of administration. Preferably, daily dosage levels are from 0.5 mg to 2 g.

The following Examples illustrate the invention:

### Proteomic Screen

When investigating compounds that bind S100A9 or RAGE in a proteomics screen, no compounds were identified which bound RAGE, whilst compounds which bound S100A9 were identified. Thus in order to identify compounds that modulate the interaction of S100A9 with a ligand such as RAGE, it is more efficient to look for compounds that bind to S100A9.

Notably, a distinguishing feature of S100A9 is its extended C-terminus, rendering it considerably larger than other S100 family members. Furthermore, S100A9 contains two EF-hands motifs (helix-loop-helix motif) flanked by conserved hydrophobic residues and separated by a hinge region. S100A9 shares this theme with the S100 protein family. The sequences of the hinge region and the C-terminal helix, H4, are the most variable among the S100 proteins. Binding of the S100A9 protein, and the S100A9 and S100A8 complex, to endothelial cells, requires the presence of calcium and zinc ions.

### The Biacore Assay

The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology, such as the BIAcore assay system, was chosen as a first step of the screening method. The assay format provides affinity and kinetic information on the interaction of a ligand and an immobilized receptor. Moreover, is the assay format particular useful in mimicking physiological conditions without labeling any of the interactants. Especially, where avidity and multivalent presentations are involved, and the monomeric interaction is weak, is the chosen assay format useful. Compounds may then be tested for their ability to modulate the ligand—receptor interaction in an inhibition assay where the ligand is co-injected with varying concentrations of compound to determine whether the compound inhibits this interaction in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, compounds may be compared as to their inhibitory potency.

### The Immobilization of RAGE to a Chip

The RAGE receptor was immobilized onto a biosensor surface using random amine coupling chemistry to a CM5 chip in a Biacore assay system. The applied form of RAGE, is a recombinant human RAGE receptor, where the extracellular domain of RAGE, amino acid 1-344, is fused to the Fc region of human IgG1. The chimeric protein was expressed in the mouse myleoma cell line, NSO, as a disulfide-linked homo-dimeric protein with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa. Human RAGE possesses two conserved glycosylation sites and heterogeneity in glycosylation results in subpopulations of RAGE, differing in N-carboxylated glycans displaying different ligand binding properties, (Srikrishna G, et al., J Immunol 175, 5412-5422, 2005). Due to extensive glycosylation of RAGE relative to that of the Fc domain and a higher mass of the latter, it was also assumed that chimeric RAGE/Fc will be coupled predominantly via the Fc domain and result in a semi-oriented coupling to the sensor chip. Thus, the chosen assay format allows the extracellular part of RAGE to be exposed to ligand binding, and reconstituting a biological model where anchored membrane receptor interacts with soluble ligands.

The biological activity of immobilized RAGE was tested by injecting a specific anti-human RAGE monoclonal antibody recognizing the extracellular domain of human RAGE, over the surface of the immobilized RAGE. FIG. 2, shows sensograms for binding of 12.5-200 nM anti-RAGE over immobilized RAGE. An apparent dissociation constant, KD, in the nanamolar range was obtained.

### The Novel Interaction S100A9 and RAGE

Binding of S100A9 to RAGE was demonstrated after the immobilization of the rhRAGE-Fc by random amine coupling to a chip. In FIG. 2, sensorgrams from injection of 37.5-200 nM S100A9 over immobilized RAGE are shown. The responses are plotted versus concentration of S100A9, a sigmoidal dose-response curve is obtained although saturation is not reached within the concentration range used, FIG. 2B. The S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins and some also require low concentrations of Zn2+ to adapt a biologically active conformation. Titration of Zn2+ for optimal binding of 100 nM S100A9 to RAGE was performed in presence of Ca2+. The optimal zinc ion concentration was determined to 10 μM Zn2+ in the presence of calcium, FIG. 3.

Under the experimental conditions used, S100A9 showed more than 10-fold higher binding to RAGE than the next group of RAGE binders (AnxII, S100Al2, and S100A8/9), FIG. 5. In vivo, S100A9 usually forms hetero-dimeric complexes with S100A8.

Interestingly, the significantly lower binding of the S100A8/9 hetero-dimer to RAGE than for homo-dimeric S100A9 implicates that binding to RAGE occurs via S100A9 and that the binding site is partially blocked in the S100A8/9 hetero-dimer. The finding that weak or no binding was obtained with putative RAGE ligands like S100A1, S100Al2, S100B and S100P indicates that S100A9, unique among the S100 members to interact strongly with glycosaminoglycans and carboxylated glycans, may interact with glycans on RAGE. The S100A9 protein binding to endothelial cells has been shown to involve glycosaminoglycans structures and may be blocked by heparin and heparin sulfate. Displacement of S100A9 binding to RAGE by soluble heparin or heparan sulfate was demonstrated for the immobilized RAGE to a chip, FIG. 6. The finding demonstrates the biological relevance of the disclosed interaction between S100A9 and RAGE.

**The Compounds are Modulators of the S100A9 to RAGE Interaction**

The binding of S100A9 to immobilized RAGE is modulated by compound A, FIG. 7. Dose-dependent inhibition is obtained with an IC50 value of 63 μM for the compound A. Compound A is the first compound that has been identified that binds S100A9 (known compounds bind to the S100A9/S100A8 complex).

**The TLR4 Immobilized on Chip**

The TOLL-like receptor 4 was immobilized on the sensor chip. Binding to S100A9 was detected. FIG. 14 shows binding of S100A9 to amine-coupled human TLR4/MD-2. Sensorgrams from bottom to top represent injection of sample buffer in the absence of S100A9, 100 and 200 nM S100A9 after subtraction of the signal in the reference flow cell. Injection time was 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μL/min and regeneration was performed with a 30 μl pulse of 3 mM EDTA in HBS-P buffer (HBS-EP) for 60 s. Arrows indicate injection of sample (1; association phase), running buffer (2; dissociation phase) and regeneration solution (3). HBS-P containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 μM ZnCl2 (Robinson et al. 2002) was used as running and sample buffer. An apparent dissociation constant of 8.6×10−8M, on- and off-rates of 3.9×104 l/Ms and 3.5×10−4 l/s, and maximal binding at 1.8×103 RU were calculated after fitting data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model (Chi2 6.8).

FIG. 15 shows displacement of S100A9 binding to immobilized human TLR4/MD-2 complex by soluble compound A. In (A), sensograms after injection of S100A9, 100 nM, in the absence or presence of compound A as competitor are shown. Sensograms from top to bottom represent: S100A9 without and with 7.8125, 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μM compound A as competitor. In (B), binding data is plotted as an inhibition curve. IC50 value for compound A was calculated to ˜53 μM (r2 0.989). Arrows in (A) indicate start of the association phase (1), i.e. injection of S100A9±competitor, and dissociation phase (2), where running buffer is pumped over the surface. Injection time, flow rate and regeneration conditions were as in FIG. 1. HBS-P containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 μM ZnCl2 (Robinson et al. 2002) was used as running and sample buffer.

In vitro Assay—MLR

**S100A9 Surface Expression of Human Monocytes**

The S100A9 molecule is present on the cell surface of only a minority of human PBMC. This can be illustrated by staining total human PBMC with a flourescien-labelled antibody specific for S100A9 followed by analysis in a FACS analyser. As shown in FIG. 8, only a small population of the cells bound the antibody while the majority of the cells had a flourescence equal to that seen after incubation with an isotype matched antibody with unknown specificity as a negative control. Furthermore, when the cells had been pre-incubated with a TLR4 ligand (LPS) for 24 hours the fraction of PBMCs that expressed S100A9 remained more or less constant while the staining intensity of the population was increased, indicating that each S100A9-binding cell expressed more molecules on the cell surface.

Monocytes have been described as one of the S100A9 expressing cell types in human blood (Zwadlo et al. (1988) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 72, 510). Indeed, essentially all monocytes can be shown to express S100A9 on the cell surface by FACS analysis (FIG. 9) and also on this cell population the level of surface expression is increased after stimulation with a TLR ligand.

Knowing that TOLL stimulation increased the surface expression of S100A9 on human monocytes in vitro it was of interest to address whether blockade of S100A9 could have any functional consequence on human monocytes. To this end we designed an in vitro assay, FIG. 10.

FIG. 11 shows an example of such analysis. We have noted that in the

MLR reactions using TOLL-stimulated monocytes as stimulators cells, a specific cell population could be detected after 4 days. This cell population was CD11blow and CD14− as determined by FACS analysis. If the stimulator cells were pre-incubated in medium only, this population did not appear (FIG. 11). Addition of a S100A9 binding compound to the preincubation cultures at the indicated concentrations reduced the percentage of CD11blowCD14− cells in the MLR reaction in a dose-dependent fashion. This was true independently of whether the pre-incubation cultures had been stimulated with a TLR3 or a TLR4 ligand. Hence, this simple in vitro assay can be used to functionally assess S100A9 binding compounds influence on biological function in vitro.

The MLR assay is described in Bach & Hirschhorn (1964), Science 143, 813.

In vitro Assay for S100A9 binding Compounds Modulating TOLL-Dependent Stimulation of Human PBMC

Human PBMC were incubated over night in medium only or together with a TLR4 ligand (LPS) or a TLR3 ligand (polidI:dC). After this pre-incubation period, monocytes were purified based on their CD14 expression using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 antibodies. These CD14 cells were in turn used as stimulators in a Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR) with PBMC from an allogeneic donor. After 4 days the MLR reaction can be analysed using various methods.

Treatment with S100A9 Binding Compounds has Effects on Dendritic Cell Populations in Human blood.

Human monocytes belong to a cell type that is usually referred to as Antigen Presenting Cells (APC). The monocytes can, upon proper stimulation, exit the blood stream into tissues and coupled to this process is their differentiation into distinct cellular phenotypes such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC). DC are also found circulating in the blood stream and can be further subdivided based on surface markers. DC are also regarded as the major immunoregulatory type of APC. It was therefore of interest to investigate whether treatment of human subjects with S100A9 binding compound influenced the levels of DC in the blood. We here took advantage of an ongoing Phase Ib study where SLE patients are treated with compound A, a S100A9 binding compound. Blood samples from the patients were taken before treatment (Day 0), at steady-state one month after treatment (day 28) and two weeks after treatment was stopped (Day 98). Two dose group of three patients each were available for analysis; 1.5 mg/day and 3 mg/day. PBMCs were analysed at these times for the presence of totals DC (FIG. 12) and plasmacytoid DC (FIG. 13). As can be seen in FIGS. 15 and 16, both the percentage of total DC and of plasmacytoid DC were reduced when the patients were under treatment with compound A compared to pre- and post-treatment levels. Thus, treatment of humans with S100A9 binding compounds has an effect on APC in vivo.

## Materials and Methods

### Compound A

The compound A was synthesized according to the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,851. Compound A is described in formula (I) of FIG. 1 of the document.

### Biosensor Analysis

Binding analysis was performed using the “surface plasmon resonance” (SPR) technology with a Biacore 3000™ system. This technology allows analysis of an interaction between proteins and small molecules in a real-time and label-free manner. A protein or low-molecular weight compound is injected over a surface (a CM5 sensor chip) with a covalently coupled ligand and the signal produced, expressed as resonance units (RU), is directly proportional to the number and mass of the molecule interacting with the ligand on the surface. Immobilization, regeneration scouting, surface performance tests and binding studies were conducted basically according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Kinetic evaluation of binding data was carried using the BIAevaluation Software Version 3.2 (Biacore AB). Optimization of conditions for immobilization and binding analysis is carried out for each interaction to be studied. A biosensor analysis cycle consists of: (i) injection of S100A9 over the RAGE surface for 3 min (association phase) or (i) injection of S100A9 over the TLR4/MD-2 surfaces, in the absence or presence of 100 ng/mL LPS, for 3 min (association phase); (ii) injection of running buffer for 2.5 min (dissociation phase); (iii) injection of a 30 s pulse of 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0-2.125 (regeneration phase); and (iv) injection of running buffer for 2 min (stabilization after regeneration) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min.

Identity and homogeneity of S100 proteins were tested on SDS-PAGE.

### Immobilization of RAGE

Recombinant human RAGE was obtained from R&D Systems (cat. No. 1145-RG) as a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of RAGE, comprising a.a. 1-344, and the Fc region of human IgG1 via a peptide linker. The chimeric protein was expressed in the mouse myleoma cell line NSO as a disulfide-linked homo-dimeric protein with a calculated molecular mass of 61 kDa. Prior to covalent coupling to the sensor chip, buffer was changed to a standard Biacore buffer (10 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20; HBS-P) using Fast Protein Desalting Micro-Spin Columns (Pierce). RAGE was diluted in an immobilization buffer shown to give sufficient pre-concentration and then covalently coupled using the “Aim at immobilization level” function in the Biacore Wizard to obtain various coupling densities. Activity of immobilized RAGE was tested by injecting a specific anti-human RAGE monoclonal antibody over the surface. Due to extensive glycosylation of RAGE relative to that of the Fc domain and a higher mass of the latter, it was also assumed that chimeric RAGE/Fc will be coupled predominantly via the Fc domain and result in a semi-oriented coupling to the sensor chip. HBS-P, with a final concentration of 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 μM ZnCl2, was used as sample and running buffer throughout the study. For regeneration of the surface after each cycle, a pulse of 10 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.125, was used. To determine optimal zinc concentration for binding of S100A9 protein to RAGE, the interaction was allowed to take place at a fixed calcium concentration (1 mM) and with the zinc concentration titrated from zero to ten μM.

Interaction of Soluble S100A9 with the RAGE Surface

Recombinant S100A9, expressed as the full-length sequence of native protein in E. coli was obtained using a four-step purification protocol. Purity was checked on over-loaded SDS-PAGE gels and found to be >95% homogeneous. Buffer was changed to HBS-P using the Fast Protein Desalting Spin Columns and concentration determined in the BCA protein assay from Pierce with bovine albumin as standard. A 10 μM stock solution based on the homodimeric molecular weight of S100A9 was prepared and stored in aliquots frozen at −25° C. From this, a working solution of 1000 nM in HBS-P was prepared and diluted to the concentration to be tested with ZnCl2 and CaCl2 added to a final concentration of 10 μM Zn2+ and 250 or 1000 μM Ca2+ according to the buffer system proposed by Robinson et al. (2002).

### Immobilization of TLR4/MD-2 Complex

Recombinant human TLR4/MD-2 was obtained from R&D Systems (cat. no. 3146-TN/CF) as a non-covalently associated protein of the respective extracellular domains. Prior to covalent coupling to the sensor chip, buffer was changed to a standard Biacore buffer (10 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% v/v Surfactant P20; HBS-P) using Fast Protein Desalting Micro-Spin Columns (Pierce).

The human recombinant TLR4 amino acid sequence consists of human CD33 Signal peptide (Met 1-Ala 16), human TLR4 (Glu 24-Lys 631), and 10× histidines. The chimeric protein was expressed in a mouse myeloma cell line, NSO.

The human recombinant MD-2, amino acid sequence consists of human human CD33 Signal peptide (Met 1-Ala 16), human MD-2 (Glu 17-ASN 160), and 10× histidines. The chimeric protein was expressed in a mouse myeloma cell line, NSO.

Interaction of Soluble S100A9 with the TLFR4/MD-2 Surface

Recombinant S100A9, expressed as the full-length sequence of native protein in E. coli was obtained using a four-step purification protocol. Purity was checked on over-loaded SDS-PAGE gels and found to be >95% homogeneous. Buffer was changed to HBS-P using the Fast Protein Desalting Spin Columns and concentration determined in the BCA protein assay from Pierce with bovine albumin as standard. A 10 μM stock solution based on the homodimeric molecular weight of S100A9 was prepared and stored in aliquots frozen at −25° C. From this, a working solution of 1000 nM in HBS-P was prepared and diluted to the concentration to be tested with ZnCl2 and CaCl2 added to a final concentration of 10 μM Zn2+ and 250 or 1000 μCa2+ according to the buffer system proposed by Robinson et al. (2002).

### Competition Assay

In order to analyze compounds as potential inhibitors of the S100A9—RAGE interaction, S100A9 was injected over the RAGE surface in the absence or presence of serially diluted compound. Compounds were dissolved either directly as a 2 mM solution in HBS-P or in double-distilled water at 5 or 10 mM concentration and stored in aliquots at −25° C. In the latter case, compounds were diluted to a 2 mM working solution by adding 10% v/v 100 mM Hepes, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 v/v Surfactant P20. Biomolecules known to interact with S100A9 in a calcium-dependent manner and with an affinity in the low nanomolar range are glycosaminoglycans like heparin and heparan sulfate (Robinson et al., 2002). Therefore, heparin and heparan sulfate were used as positive controls in the assay to test their ability to inhibit the S100A9 interaction with immobilized RAGE.

### Evaluation of Binding Data

Binding data was evaluated by fitting to standard binding models, where appropriate, or calculation of response at late association phase using Steady state affinity function using the BIAevaluation Software version 3.2. Affinity was determined either from kinetic analysis (on- and off-rates) or from plotting of responses versus concentration of S100A9 in a saturation curve. In the inhibition assay format, the concentration of competitor yielding 50% inhibition of S100A9 bound in the absence of competitor (IC50 value) was calculated by fitting binding data to a one-site competition model in GraphPad Prism or after log-logit transformation of data and linear regression.

### Purification of Splenic DCs and Human PBMCs

Spleens and lymph nodes from treated and untreated mice were cut into small pieces and treated with collagenase and DNA:ase to release the DCs from the tissue. The DCs were positively selected using CD11c-magnetic microbeads. Human PBMCs were isolated from whole blood using gradient centrifugation.

### MLR Reactions

Human PBMCs were cultured in vitro over night in tissue culture medium. The cells were either activated by the TLR ligands LPS or poly I-C or not activated. Various concentrations of compound A was added to parallel cultures. After the over night culture CD14-positive cells were purified using CD14-magnetic beads. These cells were γ-irradiated and used as stimulator cells in the MLR-reaction. From another donor, CD4-positive cells were purified using CD4-magnetic beads. The proliferation of the responder T cells was determined on day 4 of culture by measuring incorporation of 3H-thymidine.

### Analysis of Cell Subsets by Flow Cytometry

Collagenase/DNAse-treated spleen or lymph node cell suspensions or purified DCs were blocked with anti-Fc mAb and stained with the following fluorescently labeled antibodies: CD11c, CD4 and CD8. Human PBMCs or cells from MLR-reactions were stained with the following fluorescently labeled antibodies: CD11b, CD14 and S100A8/A9. Stained cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded using 7-actinomycin D

## Autoimmune Disease Models

Compound A shows a dose dependent inhibition of disease induction in several animal models of autoimmune disease. Compound A is suitable for use in the clinical treatment of diseases resulting from pathologic inflammation and autoimmunity, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), collagen induced arthritis (CIA), multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Compound A inhibits disease in a spontaneous animal model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in MRL lpr/lpr mice, in a spontaneous model for type I diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and in an induced model for multiple sclerosis, i.e., acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aEAE) induced by immunization with spinal cord homogenate (Table 1). All these models have been the most widely used models for the human diseases.

Experimental Lupus Model in MRL lpr/lpr Mice

The MRL lpr/lpr mouse spontaneously develops an autoimmune disease resembling human SLE. The SLE-like disease in these mice is characterized by immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis measured as proteinuria and hematuria, enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes and production of anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. Clinical signs can be detected at approximately 8 weeks of age. The main cause of death in these mice is renal failure. The mice were used for experiments from the age of 14-15 weeks. The development of glomerulonephritis measured as proteinuria and hematuria was followed. The mice were sacrificed after development of full SLE-like disease. Percent survival was calculated at the end of the experiment when the mice had reached the age of 23-24 weeks. Compound A (1 or 5 mg/kg/day) was administered in drinking water from 14-15 weeks and throughout the experiment.

### The Nonobese Diabetic (NOD) Mouse Model for Autoimmune Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM)

The NOD mouse spontaneously develops autoimmune IDDM and serves as an animal model for the human type I diabetes. NOD mice start to develop clinical symptoms of diabetes at 14-16 weeks of age. Mice were used in experiments from the age of 10 weeks. The development of overt diabetes was evaluated by measuring the existence of glucose in urine. If positive for glucose in urine, the animals were scored diabetic and sacrificed. Treatment with compound A (0.008, 0.04, 0.2, 1 or 5 mg/kg/day) was administered in the drinking water from 10 weeks to 26 weeks of age. Treatment with compound A (1 or 5 mg/kg/day) was administered in the drinking water from 5 weeks to 12 weeks of age.

Acute Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (aEAE) Model

EAE is a murine model for autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. EAE in the mouse shares many features with the human disease multiple sclerosis. SJL/N female mice were used for the experiments. Complete Freund's adjuvant containing H37Ra mycobacteria was emulsified with an equal volume of mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH). The inoculum was injected intradermally at the base of the base of the tail. Pertussis toxin was injected i.p. at day 0 and 3 after immunization. The disability symptoms appear about eight days post immunization (p.i.) and peaks around 12 days p.i. Treatment with compound A (0.04, 0.2 or 1 mg/kg/day) was given at days 3 to 7 and 10 to 12 p.i. Control animals received saline. The animals were scored for clinical signs of paralytic disease on a scale from 0 to 5 in the following way; 0, normal; 1, limp tail; 2, hind limb paresis; 3, hind limb paralysis, and limp foreleg; 4, bilateral hind and fore limb paralysis; 5 death. Clinical scores were monitored daily from day 9 until the end of the experiment at day 14. Treatment effects were calculated as percent inhibition of mean clinical scores compared to saline treated controls.

## Generation of Anti-S100A9 Monoclonal Antibody 43/8

A 10 week old C57BL/6 mouse with an inactivated S100A9 gene was immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg recombinant S100A9 protein precipitated with alum. Six weeks later the animal was boosted with the identical antigen using the same procedure. Three days after boosting the spleen was removed and fused to SP2/0 cells using a standard protocol. Stable hybridomas were selected using HAT selection. Hybridomas were screened using an ELISA were the recombinant S100A9 was used as the coating antigen and antibody reactions were revealed using an enzyme-coupled rabbit-anti mouse antibody followed by interaction with substrate giving rise to a color reaction. Positive hybridomas were cloned using limiting dilution and a clonal cell line isolated at dilutions where only single cell progeny can be expected based on Poisson statistics.

### BIACORE™ Assays Demonstrates the Binding Ability of the Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8

The binding of human and murine S100A8, S100A9 and S100A8/S100A9 complex to the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 was demonstrated by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. Assays were performed using the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 coated on a CM5 chip at high density (3000 RU) using standard amine coupling. The S100A8 and S100A9 proteins were injected at 100 nM concentration (based on the homo- or hetero-dimeric molecular weight) for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in sample buffer (HBS-P buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+and 20 μM Zn2+) (1; association phase) followed by injection of running buffer (same as sample buffer) at (2; dissociation phase). Binding was demonstrated for the human and murine proteins, S100A8, S100A9 and the S100A8/S100A9 complex, to the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8. The binding of the S100A8 and S100A9 proteins to the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 was dependent on the metal ions Zn2+ and Ca2+. Binding was assayed in absence and presence of 1 mM Ca2+and 20 μM Zn2+. It was shown that the presence of both these metal ions were required for binding to the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8. Responses were calculated at late association phase in the absence or presence of 1 mM Ca2+ and 20 μM Zn2+in HBS-P. The other conditions were as stated above.

### The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 is Specific to Human S100A9

Various S100 proteins were assayed for binding to immobilized anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 at 100 nM and in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. Specificity for human S100A9 by the antibody was demonstrated. The anti-S100A9 antibody show, in addition to reactivity towards the human S100A8/S100A9 complex, human S100A12 and the murine S100A8/S100A9 complex, only weak or no reactivity for the other assayed human and murine S100 proteins.

Samples were injected for 2 min at 30 μl/min over amine coupled anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 at a density of ˜3,000 RU. Responses at late association phase (t˜175 s) were calculated using the steady-state affinity model in BIAevaluation. S100 proteins to be analyzed were applied on Fast Protein Desalting Columns to obtain a stock solution of 10 μM protein in HBS-P buffer. Recombinant human S100β, S100A6, S100A1 and S100A11 were obtained from ProSpec TechnoGene, Rehovat, Israel; S100A10 and annexin 2 (calpactin light and heavy chain), with an amino-terminal His6-tag, from Randox Laboratories Ltd, Antrim, UK; human recombinant S100A4 from Assay Designs, Inc, Ann Arbor, Mich., USA; human S100AB (αβ heterodimer) was from Research Diagnostics, Inc, Concord, Mass., USA; and human recombinant S100P from BioVendor Laboratory Medicine, Inc, Brno, Czech Republic. Human and murine S100A8, S100A9 and S100A8/9 were either produced recombinantly in E. coli (rhS100A9) by us, or were obtained from elsewhere. S100Al2 was purified from human granulocytes.

The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 blocks Binding of Human S100A9 to RAGE

The anti-S100A9 antibody's ability to block the binding of human S100A9 to human RAGE was measured by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. The assay was performed by coating human RAGE on a standard CM5 chip at high density (3000 RU) using standard amine coupling. S100A9, with or without mAb 43/8, was injected at 100 nM concentration for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in sample buffer (HBS-P buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 20 μM Zn2+) (1; association phase) followed by injection of sample buffer (2; dissociation phase).

Responses at late association phase, obtained after injection of 100 nM S100A9, pre-incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature ±12.5-500 nM anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8, over immobilized RAGE were plotted versus concentration of anti-S100A9 antibody. After log-logit transformation of binding data 50% inhibition of S100A9 binding (IC50) was calculated to 3.4×10″8M (r2 0.98).

### The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 Blocks Binding of Human S100A9 to TLR4/MD-2

The anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 ability to block the binding of human S100A9 to human TLR4/MD-2 complex was measured by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. The assay was performed by coating human human TLR4/MD-2 complex on a CM5 chip at a density of ˜3000 RU using standard amine coupling. Human S100A9 was injected at 100 nM with or without mAb 43/8 for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 ηl/min in sample buffer (HBS-P buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 20 μM Zn2+) (1; association phase) followed by injection of sample buffer (2; dissociation phase).

Responses at late association phase, obtained after injection of 100 nM S100A9, pre-incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature ±12.5-500 nM anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8, over immobilized TLR4/MD-2 complex were plotted versus concentration of anti-S100A9 antibody. Binding data were transformed to a log-logit plot for calculation of the IC50 value yielding 50% inhibition at 2.7×10−8 M (r2 0.91).

The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 Blocks binding of Human S100A9 to Amino-Linked Compound A

The anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 ability to block the binding of human S100A9 to amino-linked Compound A was measured by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. The assay was performed by coating amino-linked Compound A on a CM5 chip using standard amine coupling. S100A9 at 100 nM was injected over immobilized Compound A in the absence or presence of mAb 43/8 for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in sample buffer (HBS-P buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 20 μM Zn2+) (1; association phase), followed by injection of sample buffer (2; dissociation phase).

Responses at late association phase, obtained after injection of 100 nM S100A9, pre-incubated for at least 1 h at room temperature ±12.5-500 nM monoclonal anti-S100A9 antibody, over immobilized Compound A were plotted versus concentration of anti-S100A9 antibody. Binding data were transformed to a log-logit plot (D) for calculation of The IC50 value was obtained after log-logit transformation of binding data yielding 50% inhibition at 12×10−8M (r2 0.96).

### The Anti-S100A9 Antibody Recognizes a Unique Epitope

The anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 recognizes an epitope different to that of the 1C10 anti-human S100A9 antibody. The blocking of S100A9 binding to immobilized anti-S100A9 antibody in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ by the anti-S100A9 antibodies in solution was measured by BIACORE™ direct binding assay. S100A9, pre-incubated either with anti-S100A9 antibody 43/8 or 1C10, was injected over immobilized anti-S100A9 antibody 43/8. Pre-incubation with antibody 43/8 resulted in a more than ten-fold higher inhibition of S100A9 binding to immobilized 43/8 than for antibody 1C10.

The assay was performed by coating the mouse anti-S100A9 monoclonal antibody 43/8 on a CM5 chip at high density (3000 RU) using standard amine coupling. Human S100A9, at a concentration of 100 nM, was pre-incubated for at least one hour with either antibody 43/8 or 1C10 in the concentration range 0-400 nM in sample buffer (HBS-P buffer containing 1 mM Ca2+ and 20 μM Zn2+). Incubated samples were then injected for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min (1; association phase) followed by injection of sample buffer (2; dissociation phase). Responses were calculated at late association phase. The mouse anti-human S100A9 monoclonal antibody 1 C 10 was purchased from Nordic Biosite.

The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 Interacts with the Surface of Human Monocytes

Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were incubated with the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 antibody, the anti S100A8/A9 antibody 27E10 or an isotype control antibody for 30 min at 4° C. Cell-associated fluorescence signals were measured by using a FACScan flow cytofluorometer. The anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 could be seen to interact with the surface of human monocytes but with lower efficiency than the 27E10 antibody. The isotype control antibody did not give any staining over back-ground.

### The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 Stimulates TNFα-Production in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells

To test whether the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 had functional properties freshly prepared monocytes from human peripheral blood was incubated with 10 μg/m143/8 for 24 hours. As a control, cells were incubated with medium alone (negative control), 10 μg/ml of an isotype matched antibody (negative control) or 0.5 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a positive control. It was observed that the 43/8 antibody induced a robust TNFα production from human peripheral blood monocytes. This data shows that the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 has a unique ability to induce a transmembrane signal into human monocytes that's leads to a pro-inflammatory response.

### The Anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 Stimulates an NFκB Reporter Gene in LNCaP Cells

The human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP express RAGE and one of its known protein ligands S100A9. The anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 induced expression of an NFκB reporter gene transfected (pLR446) into the LNCaP cells. Triplicate cell cultures with 10×104 cells (96 well plate) were incubated for 4 h at 37° C. in 100 μl RPMI culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 μM Zn2+, before the luminescence was measured (Steadylite HTS; Perkin Elmer). PMA (1.5 ng/ml) was used as a positive control and as a negative isotype control mouse IgG1 was used. The data shows that the anti-S100A9 mAb 43/8 induced NFκB reporter gene activity in a dose dependent way via a transmembrane signal.

## Conclusion

The anti-S100A9 monoclonal antibody of the present invention specifically binds S100A9. It is capable of modulating the interactions of S100A9 to RAGE, S100A9 to TLR4, and S100A9 to Compound A. Further, the anti-S100A9 antibody demonstrates the novel and unexpected ability of inducing transmembrane signalling into human cells that leads to a pro-inflammatory response.

### Compound A is an Efficient Modulator of S100A9 Binding to RAGE and TLR4

The ability of Compound A to modulate the interactions of human S100A9 to RAGE, and to TLR4/MD-2, was compared to the substance Rolipram, (Sommer et al., Nature Medicine, vol. I, no. 3,244-248, 1995). Rolipram is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type IV and has been shown to be effective in treatment of animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE. Rolipram, (+/−)-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone, is of a different chemical class to that of Compound A.

The binding of S100A9 to immobilized RAGE, TLR41MD-2 or Compound A, was assayed in presence of Compound A and Rolipram. Compound A displayed a significantly higherinhibition of the assayed interactions than Rolipram.

Samples were injected for 3 min at 30 μl/min in HBS-P buffer over amine coupled RAGE,TLR4/MD-2 and Compound A. Binding +/− competitor was calculated as response at lateassociation phase or by fit of sensorgrams to a 1:1 Langmuir model. ICso values were calculated by fitting data to a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) model in Graph-Pad Prism.
