                        "Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) treatment is a rapidly expanding and emerging technology for cancer treatment. However, direct CAP jet irradiation is limited to the skin or can be invoked as a supplement during surgery as it only causes cell death in the upper three to five cell layers. In addition, the current cannulas from which the plasma emanates are too large for intracranial applications. To enhance efficiency and expand the applicability of the cold plasma method for brain tumors and reduce gas flow rate and size of the plasma jet, a novel micro-sized CAP (\u03bcCAP) was developed and employed to target glioblastoma tumors in the murine brain. Various plasma diagnostic techniques were applied to evaluate the physics of helium \u03bcCAP such as electron density, discharge voltage, and optical emission spectroscopy. The direct and indirect effects of \u03bcCAP on glioblastoma (U87MG-RedFluc) cancer cells in vitro were investigated and indicate that \u03bcCAP-generated short- and long-lived species and radicals [i.e. hydroxyl radical (.OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrite (NO2\u2212), et al] with increasing tumor cell death in a dose-dependent fashion. Translation of these findings to an in vivo setting demonstrates that intracranial \u03bcCAP is effective at preventing glioblastoma tumor growth in the mouse brain. The \u03bcCAP device can be safely used in mice, resulting in suppression of tumor growth. These initial observations establish the \u03bcCAP device as a potentially useful ablative therapy tool in the treatment of glioblastoma.",

                        "FIG. 1A illustrates the \u03bcCAP setup used in this work. At the end of a quartz tube, a 254 \u03bcm inner radius capillary tube was attached and insulated by epoxy. The feeding gas for this study was industrial purity He which was injected into the quartz tube with a 0.1 L/min gas flow rate. FIG. 1B illustrates \u03bcCAP direct treatment in which the \u03bcCAP was used to treat culture medium containing glioblastoma cancer cells. FIG. 1C shows \u03bcCAP indirect treatment in which the \u03bcCAP was used to first treat DI water. After treatment, the DI water is transferred to culture medium containing cells (70 \u03bcL DMEM (containing cells)+30 \u03bcL treated DI water, total 100 \u03bcL). The time for both direct and indirect treatment was 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 seconds. FIG. 1D shows the spectrum of the He \u03bcCAP with a flow rate of 0.1 L/min. The identification of the emission line and bands was performed mainly according to reference. See, Pearse, R. W. B.; Gaydon, A. G.; Pearse, R. W. B.; Gaydon, A. G., \u201cThe identification of molecular spectra,\u201d Chapman and Hall London: 1976; Vol. 29. In the 250-300 nm wavelength range, weak emission bands were detected as NO lines. Species at the wavelength of 316, 337, 358, and 381 nm could be defined as N2 3\u03a0 or NO \u03b22\u03a0, as both of species have possible optical emission at these wavelengths. The helium bands were assigned between 500 and 750 nm in FIG. 1D. Species at a wavelength of 309 nm could be defines as OH. Both He bands between 250 and 425 nm could be defined as ROS/RNS.",
                        "The experimental RMS is shown in FIG. 2A. The dependence of the output RMS signal on parameters of the scattering channel can be expressed as U=A\u03c3V, where A is the proportionality coefficient (A=263.8V\u03a9/cm2) and V is the plasma volume. The volume of the plasma column was determined from Intensified Charged-Coupled Device (ICCD) images. \u03c3 is plasma conductivity by using the following expression: \u03c3=2.82\u00d710\u22124ne+\u03bdm/(\u03c92+\u03bdm2), \u03a9\u22121 cm\u22121, where \u03bdm is the frequency of the electron-neutral collisions, ne is the plasma density, and \u03c9 is the angular frequency.

Combining these equations, yields ne=((\u03c92+\u03bdm2)U)/((2.82\u00d710\u22124A\u03bdm)V). Therefore, we can calculate the total electron number in the plasma as Ne=neV=U(\u03c92+\u03bdm2)/(2.82\u00d710\u22124A\u03bdm). The electron number of He \u03bcCAP is presented in FIG. 2B, and the total electron number for one discharge period is 2.4\u00d7109.",
                        "\u03bcCAP treatment of DI water and DMEM were performed to induce changes in the concentration of ROS and RNS as a function of the treatment time. Indeed, as shown in FIG. 3, NO2\u2212 concentration in He \u03bcCAP treated DI water and DMEM increase with the duration of treatment time. The NO2\u2212 mainly originates as NO (N2+e\u21922N+e, N+O2\u2192+O, 4NO+O2+2H2O\u21924NO2\u2212+4H+), while most of NO is formed in the gas phase during the afterglow a few million seconds after the discharge pulse. The NO2\u2212 concentration in DMEM treated with He \u03bcCAP is higher than that in DI water.",

                        "MB concentration was used to assess the concentration of .OH. It is known that MB reacts with .OH aqueous solutions leading to a visible color change. Satoh, A. Y.; Trosko, J. E.; Masten, S. J., \u201cMethylene blue dye test for rapid qualitative detection of hydroxyl radicals formed in a Fenton's reaction aqueous solution,\u201d Environmental science & technology 2007, 41, (8), 2881-2887.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 4, the relative MB concentration decreases with treatment time of He \u03bcCAP. The relative MB concentration decreases by 9.3% after He \u03bcCAP treated DI water for 120 seconds. While this change is large, He \u03bcCAP treated DMEM showed a stronger degradation action (14.7%), suggesting that more short-living reactive species are generated in DMEM. Overall, these findings demonstrate that there is an increase in the concentration of OH as a function of \u03bcCAP treatment time.",
                        "FIG. 5 shows the ROS concentration dependence on treatment time in He \u03bcCAP treated DI water and DMEM. H2O2 generation might be attributed to the high electron density and energy of the plasma (He\u2192He++e, He++H2O\u2192H2O++He, H2O++H2O\u2192H3O++.OH; He+e\u2192He*+e, He*+H2O\u2192He+.OH+H.; H2O+e\u2192H2O*+e, H2O*\u2192.OH+H.; .OH+OH\u2192H2O2). The H2O2 concentration increases with the duration of plasma treatment time in both DI water and DMEM, although the concentration of H2O2 generated in DI water is higher than DMEM.",

                        "FIG. 6A shows the cell viability of the glioblastoma cancer cells treated with He \u03bcCAP indirect treatment after 24 and 48 hours. The cell viability after 24 hours incubation (normalized by DMEM control) decreased by approximately 14.2%, 19.9%, 25.4%, 29.0%, 34.7%, and 39.2%, respectively, according to a 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 second treatment duration. After 48 hours incubation, the cell viability decreased by approximately 18.3%, 35.6%, 34.8%, 41.1%, 54.7%, and 51.4%, respectively, for a 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 second treatment duration. FIG. 6B shows the cell viability of glioblastoma cancer cells after 24 and 48 hours incubation with He \u03bcCAP direct treatment (treat 100 \u03bcL media containing cells) for 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 seconds duration. The cell viability of the glioblastoma cancer cells after 24 hours incubation (normalized by control) decreased by approximately 15.4%, 27.1%, 28.9%, 44.1%, and 65.1%, respectively, according to 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 second treatment duration. Similar dose-dependent (i.e. increase treatment time) decreases in cell viability were found with 48 hour incubation.",
                        "In order to determine the effect of the novel plasma device effect on glioblastoma in vivo, we directly applied He \u03bcCAP for 15 seconds to glioblastoma tumors in the brain of living mice via an implanted endoscopic tube as shown in FIG. 7A. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging (FIG. 7B), the tumor volume in a control animal (helium only) increased nearly 400% over the course of two days, whereas He \u03bcCAP treated tumor volume decreased approximately 50% compared with baseline levels. These striking findings demonstrate the potential of \u03bcCAP to inhibit glioblastoma tumor growth in vivo.",
                        "CAP has received considerable attention for its potential biomedical applications. Emerging fields of application of CAP include wound healing, sterilization of infected tissue, inactivation of microorganisms, tooth bleaching, blood coagulation, skin regeneration, and cancer therapy. This has been collectively termed \u2018plasma medicine\u2019. Both direct and indirect applications of CAP have been shown to be effective for treating various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, as discussed above, the treatment of tumors deep within the body has been hampered by the limitations of CAP deliver tools. Thus, we aimed to develop and study how application of a novel He \u03bcCAP device could induce high cell death both in vitro and in vivo.",
                        "Treating culture media containing cells (direct treatment) was compared to treating DI water and removing it to culture media containing cells (indirect treatment). Our findings suggests that both He \u03bcCAP direct/indirect treatment could induce high cell death in glioblastoma cancer cells (FIG. 6), although, in general direct treatment was more effective than that of indirect. Plasma contains the energies ions, free radicals, reactive species, UV radiation, and the transient electric fields inherent with plasma delivery, which interact with the cells and other living organisms. In many cases, it has been reported that plasma induced apoptosis in cancer cells had no adverse effect on the normal cells when administered at the comparable dosage provided to cancer cells.

Z., The selective characterization of nonthermal atmospheric pressure plasma jet on treatment of human breast cancer and normal cells.

Scientific reports 2015, 5, 18339. As previously shown, the inactivation effect on bacteria by UV-radiation in mostly related to DNA/RNA damage at a UV wavelength of 200-280 nm. See., Chen, W.; Huang, J.; Du, N.; Liu, X. -D.; Wang, X. -Q.; Lv, G. -H.; Zhang, G. -P.; Guo, L. -H.; Yang, S. -Z., Treatment of enterococcus faecalis bacteria by a helium atmospheric cold plasma brush with oxygen addition. Journal of Applied Physics 2012, 112, (1), 013304. Thus, it can be argued that UV photons are not the major \u03bcCAP species with our experimental setup (FIG. 1). The absorption cross-section of ROS in the UV spectral range is relatively small (Winter, J.; Tresp, H.; Hammer, M.; Iseni, S.; Kupsch, S.; Schmidt-Bleker, A.; Wende, K.; D\u00fcnnbier, M.; Masur, K.; Weltmann, K., \u201cTracking plasma generated H2O2 from gas into liquid phase and revealing its dominant impact on human skin cells,\u201d Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics 2014, 47, (28), 285401), and the species lines between 300-350 are still not clearly determined. Radicals and electrons generated during plasma formation can be either short-lived or long-lived. These radicals or electrons reach a solution and form many complex reactions, which result in the formation of other short- and long-lived radicals or species. Short-lived radicals or species includes superoxide (O2\u2212), nitrite (NO), atomic oxygen (O), ozone (O3), hydroxyl radical (.OH), singlet delta oxygen (SOD, O2(1)), peroxynitrite (ONOO), and etc. See, Graves, D. B., The emerging role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in redox biology and some implications for plasma applications to medicine and biology.

Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics 2014, 47, (16), 165201. Long-lived species include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitrite (NO2).",
                        "In the case of \u03bcCAP indirect treatment (treatment of DI water and transfer to cells in culture medium), one can argue that the primary effects are associated with long-lived species (H2O2 and NO2\u2212). RNS are known to induce cell death via DNA damage, while ROS can induce cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. S e e, Boehm, D.; Heslin, C.; Cullen, P. J.; Bourke, P., Cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of solutions exposed to cold atmospheric plasma. Scientific reports 2016, 6, 21464; Kim, S. J.; Chung, T., Cold atmospheric plasma jet-generated RONS and their selective effects on normal and carcinoma cells. Scientific reports 2016, 6, 20332. When He is used as a carrier gas, the concentration of H2O2 and NO2\u2212 in DI water rises with time (FIG. 3 and FIG. 5). Analyzing cell viability, one can see that He \u03bcCAP has a strong effect on glioblastoma (U87MG) cancer cells. The \u03bcCAP-generated H2O2 and NO2\u2212 concentration increase with treatment time, in line with the linear increase in cancer cell killing efficiency. However, there might be additional antitumor pathways related to H2O2 and NO2\u2212. For example, H2O2 and NO2\u2212 are believed to generate peroxynitrite (H2O2+2NO2\u22122HONOO\u2212) that is known to be toxic to cells. HONOO\u2212 is stable at basic pH (DI water <6) or otherwise it immediately decomposes into NO3\u2212. However, HONOO\u2212 may be difficult to generate in media because media is buffered and only slightly basic (pH >7). See, Kurake, N.; Tanaka, H.; Ishikawa, K.; Kondo, T.; Sekine, M.; Nakamura, K.; Kajiyama, H.; Kikkawa, F.; Mizuno, M.; Hori, M., Cell survival of glioblastoma grown in medium containing hydrogen peroxide and/or nitrite, or in plasma-activated medium. Archives of biochemistry and biophysics 2016, 605, 102-108. On the other hand, aquaporins (AQPs) play a critical role to facilitate the passive diffusion of H2O2, especially AQP8. See, Bienert, G. P.; Chaumont, F., \u201cAquaporin-facilitated transmembrane diffusion of hydrogen peroxide,\u201d Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-General Subjects 2014, 1840, (5), 1596-1604; Ishibashi, K.; Hara, S.; Kondo, S., \u201cAquaporin water channels in mammals,\u201d Clinical and experimental nephrology 2009, 13, (2), 107-117; Yan, D.; Talbot, A.; Nourmohammadi, N.; Sherman, J. H.; Cheng, X.; Keidar, M., \u201cToward understanding the selective anticancer capacity of cold atmospheric plasma\u2014model based on aquaporins (Review),\u201d Biointerphases 2015, 10, (4), 040801. Not all AQPs can transport H22, and AQPs show various transportation degrees of H2O2 in different types of human tumors. AQP1, 4, 8, and 9 are highly expressed in glioblastoma cell lines. Thus, the distinct expression pattern of AQP8 in glioblastoma might be responsible for cancer cells being sensitive to high H2O2 concentrations.",
                        "The effect of both short-lived and long-lived species or radicals is plausible when considering \u03bcCAP direct treated glioblastoma cancer cells (in vitro, FIG. 6) and tumors in the mouse brain (in vivo, FIG. 7). Of note, DMEM comprises over 30 components such as inorganic salts, amino acids and vitamins and the effect of plasma irradiation on these compounds is still unknown. Similarly, the effect of plasma irradiation in murine brain is also unknown. Therefore, unknown reactive species or radicals could be generated during the irradiation of DMEM and during in vivo application. Short- and long-lived species or radicals in DMEM and mice brain containing .OH, NO, O2\u2212, O, O3, O2(1), ONOO\u2212, H2O2 and NO2\u2212 are prominent components of antitumor plasma action. The concentration of .OH in DMEM treated by He \u03bcCAP increases with treatment time (FIG. 4). .OH derived amino acid peroxides can contribute to cell injury because .OH itself and protein (amino acid) peroxides are able to react with DNA, thereby inducing various forms of damage.

                        "When He \u03bcCAP activates DMEM, the concentration of both H2O2 and NO2\u2212 rises with treatment time (FIG. 3 and FIG. 5), and synergism of H2O2 and NO2\u2212 mentioned above might be an important factor. CAP also produces significant amount of ozone (O3), which is known to have strongly aggressive effect on cells.

Atomic oxygen (O) (including the ground state and all the excited states) is believed to have a significant effect on cells.

Moreover, nitrite (NO) and superoxide (O2\u2212) can easily form ONOO\u2212 once they collide. See, Pacher, P.; Beckman, J. S.; Liaudet, L., Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in health and disease.

Cells were incubated for 24 hours to ensure proper cell adherence and stability. On day 2, the cells were treated by He \u03bcCAP for 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 seconds. Cells were further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 and 48 hours. An MTT assay was used to assess cell viability as described above.",
                        "All animal protocols were approved by the George Washington University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 8 week old female athymic nude mice (Charles River, NU(NCr)-Foxn1nm) were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) [Ketamine (100 mg/kg) mixed with Xylazine (10 mg/kg)] and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The surface of the skull was visualized with a dissecting microscope and horizontally leveled between bregma and lambda. A small hole was drilled at the desired location. U87MG were resuspended in DMEM at a concentration of 5\u00d7105 cell/\u03bcL and injected into the frontal lobe at the following coordinates (relative to Bregma) using a Hamilton syringe: 2.2 mm ventral from the dorsal surface of the skull, 1.0 mm caudal, and 2.0 lateral. 5\u00d7105 cells were injected at a depth of 2.2 mm and the syringe was then retracted to 1.8 mm and an additional 5\u00d7105 cells were then administered. To allow for delivery of \u03bcCAP, an endoscopic tube was then implanted at a depth of 2.2 mm and secured in place with dental cement. Mice were allowed to recover for 7 days and He \u03bcCAP or vehicle control (He alone) was then administered. In brief, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and CAP was applied via the implanted endoscopic tube at 5-second intervals, followed by 15 seconds off, for a total CAP treatment time of 15 seconds. Tumor size was estimated using in vivo bioluminescent imaging before and for up to 48 hours post CAP or vehicle treatment. For bioluminescent imaging, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and the substrate luciferin was administered i.p. (150 mg/kg). The mice were then transferred to the light-sealed imaging cabinet of an IVIS Lumina K machine and positioned in a nose cone in order to maintain anesthesia. Bioluminescent images were acquired using a charge-coupled device camera cooled to \u221280\u00b0 C. to achieve maximal sensitivity. Images were acquired at 10 minutes post substrate injection with an exposure time of 20 seconds, medium binning, F/Stop=1, and EM gain off.",
                        "Results were plotted using Origin 8 as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student t-test was used to check the statistical significance (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001).",
                        "In summary, the effect of a newly developed \u03bcCAP on glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo has been demonstrated. A variety of diagnostics tools were applied to the \u03bcCAP including optical emission spectroscopy, microwave scattering, and potential measurement, which supplied evidence for reactions of plasma-generated species in media and the mouse brain. The \u03bcCAP direct treatment has a stronger effect than the indirect treatment due to the synergetic effect of short- and long-lived species, while a strong effect of indirect \u03bcCAP treatment on cancer cells is likely attributed to the action of long-lived species. The \u03bcCAP is safe for mice and suppresses tumor growth in the mouse brain. These initial observations establish \u03bcCAP as a potentially useful ablative therapy in glioblastoma.",
