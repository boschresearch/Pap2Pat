    "abstract": "Temperature compensation is performed using a computation program for temperature compensation, a computation processing, and a sensor. Deformation in a diaphragm caused by a pressure change due to the temperature of the gas in a cavity is cancelled out, and deformation of the diaphragm is minimized within the target temperature range, thereby allowing an optimum temperature compensation to be performed. The temperature compensation in a capacitance-type sensor executes calculation steps which include including a calculation step (S17) of acquiring the amount of change \u0394C\u2032 in capacitance. A parameter \u0394C\u2032 is obtained, through which it is possible to determine the degree of compensation for the deformation in the diaphragm section caused by a pressure change due to the temperature changes of the gas in the hermetically sealed space.",

                        "A semiconductor pressure sensor conventionally includes a micro-cavity and a thin diaphragm that covers a surface of the micro-cavity, and serves as a pressure gauge by measuring a change in a resistance formed on a surface of the diaphragm resulting from deformation of the diaphragm caused by external pressure, or with another electrode provided on the opposite pole, measuring a change in the capacitance between the diaphragm and the counter electrode.",
                        "In a pressure sensor configured as described above, in cases where the inside of the cavity is vacuumed and sealed, the deformation of the diaphragm is caused by a difference between outside pressure and vacuum pressure. That is, the pressure sensor corresponds to an absolute pressure sensor. On the other hand, in cases where a gas of a certain pressure is sealed in the cavity, the deformation of the diaphragm is caused by a difference between the outside pressure and the pressure of the gas in the cavity. That is, the pressure sensor is a relative pressure sensor. Even though it suffers from difficulty in keeping the inside of the cavity in vacuum, the absolute pressure sensor with the inside of the cavity vacuumed and sealed advantageously facilitates temperature compensation for a pressure sensor because the effect of the temperature-dependent contraction of the internal gas is negligible. On the other hand, since the inside of the cavity is sealed in vacuum, the diaphragm is already significantly deformed under an outside pressure of, for example, 1 atm. Thus, for the pressure sensor used at about 1 atm, it is disadvantageously difficult to use a thinner diaphragm to increase pressure sensitivity.",
                        "On the other hand, as an example of the relative pressure sensor, a capacitive pressure sensor is well-known which has a diaphragm portion that is deformable depending on pressure, which is a type of physical quantity, as typified by Patent Literature 1. Patent Literature 1 discloses a capacitive pressure sensor including a sensor chip having a first substrate with an electrode portion formed thereon and a second substrate with a diaphragm portion that is deformable depending on pressure formed thereon, a cavity portion formed in such a way that the diaphragm portion is associated with the electrode portion so as to face each other via a gap, and a sealing material externally sealing the cavity portion, the first substrate and the second substrate being bonded together, a gap width of the gap being changed depending on a difference between a pressure to be measured applied to the diaphragm portion and a pressure in the cavity portion so that the pressure difference is detected based on a change in the capacitance between the diaphragm portion and the electrode portion caused by the change in the gap width, wherein the capacitive pressure sensor further has a closure member that closes an inside of the cavity portion."

In this case, since the difference in pressure between the sealed gas and the outside air is small and the deformation of the diaphragm is insignificant, a thinner diaphragm can be provided, enabling an increase in sensitivity at about 1 atm.

However, the embodiments are not limited to this. By way of example, as shown in FIG. 25(a) and FIG. 25(b), in a capacitive sensor 800 including a substrate 81, an insulator layer 82, a first electrode portion 83, a second electrode portion 84, a diaphragm portion 85, and a closed space 87 which are similar to the corresponding portions of the capacitive sensor 100, temperature compensation members 86 each shaped generally like a rectangular parallelepiped may be arranged at every 90\u00b0 along a circumferential direction of the diaphragm portion 85, on the surface of the diaphragm portion 85 opposite to the surface of the diaphragm portion 85 on which the second electrode portion 84 is formed. In this example, as shown in FIG. 25(a), a radially outward end surface of the temperature compensation member 86 is shaped identically to an outer circumferential surface of the diaphragm portion 85 (a thick line portion in FIG. 25(a)) as viewed in a stacking direction of the substrate 81 and the insulator layer 82. The temperature compensation member 86 may be disposed at any position and have any shape provided that the temperature compensation member 86 is in a condition optimum for temperature compensation. This also applies to the capacitive sensors 200 to 400 according to the other embodiments (the second to fourth embodiments).",

However, the embodiments are not limited to this. By way of example, as shown in FIG. 26(a) and FIG. 26(b), in a piezo-resistive physical quantity sensor (a sensor) 900 including a substrate 91, an insulator layer 92, a first electrode portion 93, a second electrode portion 94, a diaphragm portion 95, and a closed space 97 which are similar to the corresponding portions of the capacitive sensor 100, sets of a temperature compensation member 96 and a piezo element 98 shaped generally like rectangular parallelepipeds may be arranged at every 90\u00b0 along a circumferential direction of the diaphragm portion 95, on the surface of the diaphragm portion 95 opposite to the surface of the diaphragm portion 95 on which the second electrode portion 94 is formed.

The piezo-resistive physical quantity sensor 900 uses the piezo element 98, having a resistance value varying depending on strain of the diaphragm portion 95, to detect the value of a pressure applied to the diaphragm portion 95. Changes in the resistance value can be detected based on outputs from the first electrode portion 93 and the second electrode portion 94. A material for the piezo element 98 may be a piezoelectric material such as PZT (lead zirconate titanate). This also applies to the other embodiments (the second to fourth embodiments).",

However, the present invention is not limited to this combination. For example, for compensation for the deformation of the diaphragm portion caused by thermal expansion of a gas sealed in the closed space, the conductive portion (electrode portion) and the temperature compensation member may be shaped like rectangular rings and the diaphragm portion may be shaped like a rectangle so that the shapes of the conductive portion, the temperature compensation member, and the diaphragm portion correspond to one another. Of course, the conductive portion, the diaphragm portion, and the temperature compensation member may have any shapes provided that the conductive portion, the diaphragm portion, and the temperature compensation member are formed to compensate for the deformation of the diaphragm portion caused by thermal expansion of the gas sealed in the closed space."
