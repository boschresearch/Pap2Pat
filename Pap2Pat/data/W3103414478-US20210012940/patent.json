    "abstract": "A magnetic memory structure employs electric-field controlled interlayer exchange coupling between a free magnetic layer and a fixed magnetic layer to switch a magnetization direction. The magnetic layers are separated by a spacer layer disposed between two oxide layers. The spacer layer exhibits a large IEC while the oxide layers provide tunnel barriers, forming a quantum-well between the magnetic layers with discrete energy states above the equilibrium Fermi level. When an electric field is applied across the structure, the tunnel barriers become transparent at discrete energy states via a resonant tunneling phenomenon. The wave functions of the two magnets then can interact and interfere to provide a sizable IEC.

                        "Many different technologies are used to create electronic data storage (\u201cmemory\u201d) elements for storing programs and data in binary form in electronic devices. Memory element technologies are characterized by their access times (i.e., read and write delay), density, power utilization, and volatility in the absence of power. Technologies that excel in one or more of these characteristics are typically inferior in other respects. As a result, different memory element technologies are used for different purposes, according to their particular characteristics. FIG. 1 is a graph 100 which compares read/write speed and density of various electronic data storage technologies. As shown in FIG. 1, static random access memory (RAM) (SRAM) technology can have a very fast read/write speed, which is beneficial for use with a high-speed processor, but the high speed is obtained at the expense of a large area needed for the multiple transistors of which each SRAM cell is comprised, as well as the other components of an SRAM array. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is more dense, but not as fast as high-speed SRAM. Unfortunately, both SRAM and DRAM elements are volatile, meaning that the data stored therein is lost when power is removed. In contrast, a high-density non-volatile memory (NVM) such as NAND FLASH has been developed for long-term storage, but the long access time of NVM storage is too slow for use in high-speed processor applications. Field-written magnetic RAM (MRAM) is an example of memory that can have a much faster read/write speed (i.e., short access latency) than NAND FLASH, but is non-volatile, so no power is required to preserve the data stored therein.",
                        "Data is stored in an MRAM by controlling a direction of magnetization in a free magnetic layer in a magnetic structure. A binary bit is stored as one of two magnetization directions. FIG. 2 is a graph 200 comparing energy consumption and access latency of existing MRAM technologies based on spin-transfer torque (STT), spin-orbit torque (SOT), and STT with voltage controlled magnetism (VCM) to those of SRAM. Although MRAM is non-volatile, the access latencies and energy consumption levels of the MRAM technologies are orders of magnitude higher than those of SRAM. Existing MRAM technologies require high current density for switching a magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer, causing high power consumption and less bit density than is preferred for mobile devices."

                        "Aspects disclosed herein include electric-field controlled interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) for magnetization switching. Electronic data stored in a magnetic memory structure can remain stable for a long period of time in the absence of a power source, unlike static random access memory (RAM) (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM) which lose data when power is removed. Existing magnetic RAM (MRAM) technologies employing current-induced spin-transfer torque (STT) or spin-orbit toque (SOT), however, require a large current density for switching a magnetization direction, which limits advancements in energy efficiency and bit density. A magnetic memory structure disclosed herein makes it possible to employ IEC between a free magnetic layer and a fixed magnetic layer to switch a direction of magnetization in the free magnetic layer under the control of an applied electric field with a significantly lower current density than is required in STT or SOT MRAM devices. The magnetic layers are separated by a composite layer including a spacer layer disposed between two oxide layers. The spacer layer exhibits a large IEC while the oxide layers provide tunnel barriers. The combination of a spacer layer between oxide layers forms a quantum-well (QW) between the magnetic layers with discrete energy states above the equilibrium Fermi level. When an electric field is applied in a direction across the magnetic memory structure, the tunnel barriers become transparent to the wave functions of the magnetic layers at the levels of the discrete energy states via a resonant tunneling phenomenon. This transparency allows the IEC between the fixed magnetic layer and the free magnetic layer to control the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer to be parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer depending on the magnitude of the applied electric field in the direction of the electric field. Different magnitudes of an electric field induce different signs (i.e., polarities) of IEC. Here, a positive sign of IEC refers to a switching that will yield an antiparallel alignment, and a negative sign of IEC refers to a switching that will yield a parallel alignment. The IEC can be measured as an energy density in units of Joules per square meter. A magnitude of the IEC required to achieve magnetization switching is defined by a threshold value. The IEC threshold value is independent of a parameter describing a Gilbert damping and a parameter for indicating magnets with in-plane or perpendicular anisotropies, which is not true of existing MRAM technologies. The IEC threshold value can be controlled by selection of materials, cross-sectional area, and thicknesses of the composite layer. However, the switching time of the magnetic memory structure herein can be optimized by the Gilbert damping and depends on whether the magnet has an in-plane or a perpendicular anisotropy, similar to the existing spin-torque based mechanisms.",

                        "Aspects disclosed herein include electric-field controlled interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) for magnetization switching. Electronic data stored in a magnetic memory structure can remain stable for a long period of time in the absence of a power source, unlike static random access memory (RAM) (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM) which lose data when power is removed. Existing magnetic RAM (MRAM) technologies employing current-induced spin-transfer torque (STT) or spin-orbit toque (SOT), however, require a large current density for switching a magnetization direction, which limits advancements in energy efficiency and bit density. A magnetic memory structure disclosed herein makes it possible to employ IEC between a free magnetic layer and a fixed magnetic layer to switch a direction of magnetization in the free magnetic layer under the control of an applied electric field with a significantly lower current density than is required in STT or SOT MRAM devices. The magnetic layers are separated by a composite layer including a spacer layer disposed between two oxide layers. The spacer layer exhibits a large IEC while the oxide layers provide tunnel barriers. The combination of a spacer layer between oxide layers forms a quantum-well (QW) between the magnetic layers with discrete energy states above the equilibrium Fermi level. When an electric field is applied in a direction across the magnetic memory structure, the tunnel barriers become transparent to the wave functions of the magnetic layers at the levels of the discrete energy states via a resonant tunneling phenomenon. This transparency allows the IEC between the fixed magnetic layer and the free magnetic layer to control the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer to be parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer depending on the magnitude of the applied electric field in the direction of the electric field. Different magnitudes of electric field induce different signs (i.e., polarities) of IEC. Here, a positive sign of IEC refers to a switching that will yield an antiparallel alignment, and a negative sign of IEC refers to a switching that will yield a parallel alignment. The IEC can be measured as an energy density in units of Joules per square meter. A magnitude of the IEC required to achieve magnetization switching is defined by a threshold value. The IEC threshold value is independent of a parameter describing a Gilbert damping and a parameter for indicating magnets having either in-plane or perpendicular anisotropies of the free magnetic layer, unlike existing MRAM technologies. The threshold value can be controlled by selection of materials, cross-sectional area, and thicknesses of the composite layer. However, the switching time of the magnetic memory structure herein can be optimized by the Gilbert damping and magnetic anisotropy.",
                        "To provide a context for the discussion of the magnetic memory structure illustrated in FIG. 7A, existing magnetic memory structures and the methods used for switching a magnetization direction in those structures are first discussed with reference to FIGS. 3-6B. FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a magnetic memory structure 300 that employs STT to control a magnetization direction of a free magnetic layer 304 relative to a magnetization direction of a fixed magnetic layer 302 that is separated from the free magnetic layer 304 by an oxide layer 306. The magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer 304 can be set parallel to the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer 302 by a current ISTT through the oxide layer 306 in a first direction. The magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer 304 can be set antiparallel to a direction of the fixed magnetic layer by reversing the direction of the current ISTT. Due to the high current density required to change a magnetization direction using STT, a large amount of power is consumed. The large power requirement limits packaging density, and the high current density can cause reliability problems by breaking down the oxide layer 306. A problem with STT MRAM technology is that the write time for switching the magnetization direction is inversely related to the write current required to switch the device. In other words, to decrease the switching time (e.g., reduce write access latency), the write current must be increased. Thus, reducing the large write current to save power and/or increase density results in slower write access times.",
                        "FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram of a magnetic memory structure 400 that employs SOT to control a magnetization direction of a free magnetic layer 404 relative to a magnetization direction of a fixed magnetic layer 402 separated from the free magnetic layer 404 by an oxide layer 406. To set the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer 404 (i.e., to write data into the magnetic memory structure 400), a current ISOT is passed through a spin-orbit material 408 on a planar side of the free magnetic layer 404 opposite to the oxide layer 406. The current required to write to a memory element using SOT is less than the current required for STT, but the associated power consumption is still prohibitive and limits bit density. In addition, an SOT memory structure 400 is a three-terminal device, which further limits increases in bit density.",
                        "FIG. 5A is a schematic diagram of a magnetic memory structure 500 including magnetic layers 502 and 504 separated by an oxide layer 506 wherein the STT or SOT methods of FIGS. 3 and 4 may be employed, and an illustration 508 of an energy barrier 510 created by the oxide layer 506 above the Fermi level EF. The energy barrier 510 illustrated in FIG. 5A has a height \u0394BO that represents an energy barrier that must be overcome for switching magnetization by the STT or SOT methods. FIG. 5B is a graph 512 illustrating IEC, which is a coupling of the wave functions of the respective magnetic layers across the oxide layer 506. In the graph 512, the IEC decreases to a negligible level in the oxide layer 506 as the oxide thickness DO increases from a few tenths (e.g., 0.3) of a nanometer (nm) to 1 nm and higher. At a smaller thickness, a non-negligible IEC is possible via a tunneling phenomenon, but IEC due to the wave functions of the fixed magnetic layer 502 and the free magnetic layer 504 does not exist in the oxide layer 506 having a thickness above 1 nm.",

FIG. 6A also includes an illustration 608 of the discrete energy levels of electrons below the equilibrium Fermi level EF in the spacer layer 606. Wave functions of the magnetic layers 602 and 604 exist within the spacer layer 606 due to the type of non-magnetic material of which it is formed. Quantum interference between the wave functions of the respective magnetic layers 602 and 604 can be constructive or destructive. The illustration 608 is a representation of majority/minority spin-dependent quantum-wells (QWs) with discrete energy levels within the spacer layer 606 at equilibrium.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 6B, the polarity of the IEC (having magnitude JEX) between the fixed magnetic layer 602 and the free magnetic layer 604 oscillates as a function of the spacer thickness DS of the spacer layer 606, and the oscillatory IEC peaks decrease in magnitude with increased spacer thickness. Due to the IEC, the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer 604 will adopt a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic state with respect to the magnetization direction of the fixed magnetic layer 602, depending on the thickness of the spacer layer 606.",

The composite layer 706 includes a spacer layer 708 and two oxide layers 710. The spacer layer 708 is disposed between the fixed magnetic layer 702 and the free magnetic layer 704. A first oxide layer 710 is disposed between the fixed magnetic layer 702 and the spacer layer 708, and a second oxide layer 710 is disposed between the spacer layer 708 and the free magnetic layer 704. FIG. 7A includes an illustration 711 of barriers 712 created by the oxide layers 710. The illustration 711 also shows the discrete energy states 714 that are made possible in a QW 716 formed in the composite layer 706 in the presence of an applied electric field. The discrete energy states 714 are above the Fermi level EF. The QW 716 is formed in the composite layer 706 between the fixed and free magnetic layers 702 and 704. Below the equilibrium Fermi level, majority/minority spin-dependent QWs with discrete energy levels exist within the spacer layer 708.",
                        "The oxide layers 710 create the barriers 712 having a height \u0394BC above the Fermi level EF. The barriers 712 impede the flow of electrons across the spacer layer 708, forming the QW 716. However, due to resonant tunneling phenomena, a transmission coefficient across the oxide layers 710 is increased at the discrete energy states 714 to allow a stronger interaction between the wave functions of the fixed and free magnetic layers 702 and 704. The energy states 714 in the QW 716 may be probed by contact electrochemical potential with an electric field from an input voltage Vin applied across the magnetic memory structure 700. A threshold voltage Vth is a voltage required to achieve high transmission across the oxide layers 710 via the discrete energy states 714 within the QW 716, to induce an IEC strength greater than the switching threshold value. A magnitude or strength of the IEC depends on the wave function interaction at all quantum energy states in the QW 716, including those below the Fermi level EF, and those above the Fermi level EF achieved by the application of the electric field based on the input voltage Vin. The current density in the structure depends only on the quantum energy states in the QW 716, within the separation between two contact Fermi levels. Consequently, the current density flowing in the structure is much lower than in the STT or SOT methods, when a voltage or an electric field is applied to achieve an IEC strength greater than the threshold value.",

                        "FIG. 7B is a graphic illustration of the IEC (having a magnitude JEX) in the composite layer 706 in FIG. 7A oscillating between positive and negative values and shows the IEC peaks increasing in magnitude with an increase in the electric field applied in a direction based on the input voltage Vin. The IEC increases significantly when the input voltage Vin causes the electron energy within the QW 716 to achieve one of the energy states 714. The sign of the IEC changes polarity between peaks (i.e., at each energy state 714 reached due to the applied electric field). Therefore, the IEC oscillates between positive and negative values that increase in magnitude with an applied input voltage Vin. In the example in FIG. 7B, a voltage of 1.0 volts (V) achieves a first IEC energy peak of positive polarity. As discussed below, in this example, the energy states 714 of the QW 716 also help reach a second and a third IEC peak, which are negative and positive peaks, respectively, at an input voltage Vin of 1.25 V and 1.5 V.",
                        "FIG. 8A is the graphic illustration in FIG. 7B with labels at voltage levels P1-P4. The input voltage Vin applied to the magnetic memory structure 700 in FIG. 7A at voltage level P1 in FIG. 8A is 0 V. Since there is negligible transmission of electron wave functions across the oxide barriers, IEC at voltage level P1 is also negligible. In the example in FIG. 8A, when the voltage Vin is raised to 1.0 V at P2, a sizable positive IEC is achieved via energy states of the QW 716. With a positive IEC at the voltage level P2, there should be an anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the free magnetic layer 704 and the fixed magnetic layer 702. However, magnetization switching does not occur in the magnetic memory structure 700 until the magnitude of the IEC reaches a switching threshold, which is defined by a threshold value of an energy density of IEC. The switching threshold is attained by the input voltage Vin shown in the illustration 711 in FIG. 7A. In other words, the magnitude of the IEC is below the switching threshold at the voltage of 1.0 volts at voltage level P2, so the IEC is not strong enough to cause the direction of magnetization in the free magnetic layer 704 to be switched by the magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer 702. As the voltage Vin is increased from 1.0 V, the IEC magnitude initially decreases and then becomes an increasing negative value. When the input voltage Vin reaches 1.25 V at voltage level P3, another IEC peak with negative polarity is achieved via energy states 714 of the QW 716. With a negative IEC, there should be a ferromagnetic coupling between the free magnetic layer 704 and the fixed magnetic layer 702. The magnitude of the IEC is above the switching threshold at voltage level P3, and the IEC has a negative value, so ferromagnetic coupling causes the direction of magnetization of the free magnetic layer 704 to switch to become parallel to the direction of magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer 702, or causes the direction of magnetization of the free magnetic layer 704 to remain parallel to the direction of magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer 702 if already parallel. When the input voltage Vin reaches 1.5 V at voltage level P4, another IEC peak with positive polarity is achieved via energy states 714 of the QW 716. With a positive IEC, there should be an anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the free magnetic layer 704 and the fixed magnetic layer 702. At voltage level P4, with a positive IEC that is above the switching threshold, the direction of magnetization of the free magnetic layer 704 will switch to become antiparallel to the direction of the magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer 702 or the direction of magnetization of the free magnetic layer 704 will remain antiparallel to the direction of magnetization of the fixed magnetic layer 702 if already antiparallel.",

The switching does not depend on the polarity of the applied voltage but depends on the magnitude. This aspect is shown in the results of a simulation illustrated in FIG. 8B. FIG. 8B includes a graph of a simulation of pulses of the input voltage Vin of a polarity (e.g., positive or negative between the fixed magnetic layer 702 and the free magnetic layer 704) creating an electric field in a direction (e.g., through the composite layer 706) across the magnetic memory structure 700. The voltage levels of the pulses in FIG. 8B correspond approximately with the voltage levels P4, P3, and P2 shown in FIG. 8A.

The input voltage Vin corresponding to voltage level P4 at a higher energy state 714 of the QW 716 should be reduced quickly to 0 V to avoid unintentionally changing the magnetization direction. For example, if the input voltage Vin is raised to 1.6 V to set the magnetization directions to be antiparallel, and the voltage then decreases slowly, such that the input voltage Vin is near 1.3 V for at least the minimum switching time IEC, the magnetization of the free layer 704 could unintentionally return to a parallel state (e.g., corresponding to voltage level P3).",

As noted above with regard to the examples in FIGS. 3 and 4, in which the magnetization of the magnetic memory structures 300 and 400 are switched by STT and SOT, respectively, it was noted that those methods require a large current density.

For example, to reduce the large current density JSTT0, to avoid high power consumption, etc., the Gilbert damping factor \u03b1g could be reduced, but a reduction in the Gilbert damping factor \u03b1g would increase the switching time s0.",

This contrasts to the situation of STT MRAM, in which the current density required to switch a magnetization direction depends on both the Gilbert damping factor \u03b1g and the parameter n that determines whether the free magnetic layer has in-plane or perpendicular anisotropy. The energy density required for switching in STT is directly proportional to the Gilbert damping factor, but the minimum switching time is inversely proportional to the Gilbert damping factor \u03b1g. Thus, reducing the energy density (i.e., current density) required to switch a magnetization direction in an STT type MRAM increases the minimum time for switching. Thus, STT suffers from a trade-off between current density and switching time.

Thus, the first magnitude of the input voltage Vin and the second magnitude of the input voltage Vin depend on the QW width, which corresponds to a thickness of the spacer layer 708.
