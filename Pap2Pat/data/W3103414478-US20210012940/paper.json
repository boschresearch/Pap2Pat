The basic idea relies on the formation of a quantum-well (QW) within the spacer material and controlling the transmission coefficient across the structure with an electric-field via the resonant tunneling phenomena. Using non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method, we show that the structure can exhibit a bias-dependent oscillatory IEC that can switch the free magnet to have either a parallel or an antiparallel configuration with respect to the fixed magnet, depending on the sign of the IEC. Such bi-directional switching can be achieved with the same voltage polarity but different magnitudes. With proper choice of the spacer material, the current in the structure can be significantly reduced. Due to the conservative nature of the exerted torque by the IEC, the switching threshold of the proposed mechanism is decoupled from the switching speed, while the conventional spin-torque devices exhibit a trade-off due to the non-conservative nature of the exerted torque.",

                "Magnetization switching using current-induced spin-transfer torque (STT) 1, 2 has attracted increasing interest for non-volatile memory technologies like magnetoresistive random access memory [3][4][5] . However, the large current density required for STT switching is limiting the technological advancement in terms of the energy efficiency and bit density. Recently, there is a growing interest in the voltage or electric-field controlled switching mechanisms [6][7][8][9][10] as a possible solution to address the issues involving memory bandwidth and high-power consumption 8,11 .",
                "Summary of key contributions. In this paper, we propose a composite structure that can enable electric-field controlled magnetization switching assisted solely by the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between the fixed and the free magnets. The magnets are separated by two tunnel barriers sandwiching a thin layer of a spacer material that exhibits large IEC. The electric-field control of IEC relies on the formation of a quantum-well (QW) within that spacer layer with discrete energy states positioned above the equilibrium Fermi level, which enables electric-field induced modulation of the transmission coefficient between the two magnets via the resonant tunneling phenomena. We use Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method 12 to show that a sizable bias-dependent oscillatory IEC could be induced which, in turn, could switch the free magnet to have either a ferromagnetic (F) or an antiferromagnetic (AF) configuration with respect to the fixed magnet, depending on the sign of the IEC. The configuration will be retained once the electric-field is removed because the barriers suppress the equilibrium IEC.",
                "Switching in both directions could be possible for the same bias-polarity, but different magnitudes above the switching threshold, which is different from the existing electrical switching mechanisms. We use a coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation 13,14 to show that the switching threshold of the electric-field controlled IEC energy is independent of the Gilbert damping and same for magnets with in-plane and perpendicular anisotropies. We argue that the proposed structure can be optimized to lower both the current in the structure and the operating voltage, while getting a sizable bias-dependent IEC for magnetization switching. On the other hand, the switching speed is inversely proportional to the Gilbert damping and slower for a perpendicular magnet as compared to an in-plane magnet. These unique features of the proposed structure suggest that devices with significantly improved energy-delay product can be designed.",
                "2 Electric-field control of the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) Basic mechanism. Our prediction is based on the well-established phenomenon that two ferromagnets (FM) separated by a metallic [15][16][17][18] or a non-metallic 19,20 spacer layer prefers either a F or an AF configuration at equilibrium, depending on the sign of the IEC. The sign of the IEC oscillates periodically as a function of the spacer thickness (see Fig. 1(a)), due to the quantum-interference by the majority and the minority spins in the spacer as they see different QW like potential profiles below the equilibrium Fermi level E F formed at the magnetic interfaces [21][22][23][24] . On the other hand, a metallic spacer which forms additional QW states above E F and the transparency between the magnets can be controlled using an electric-field via resonant tunneling phenomena. This structure will exhibit a bias-dependent oscillation in IEC that grows in magnitude. Barrier heights are 0.7 eV and widths are 1 nm each. Spacer thickness is 0.8 nm. a thick oxide barrier significantly reduces such IEC (see Fig. 1(b)) and the two FMs do not have a preferential configuration at equilibrium. We introduce two oxide barriers at the two magnetic interfaces of the structure in Fig. 1(a) (see Fig. 1(c)), which form a QW with discrete energy states above E F . At these discrete states, transmission coefficients are high as seen for the resonant tunneling diodes 25 . These states can be probed by tuning the contact electrochemical potentials (\u00b5 1,2 ) with an electric-field across the structure. Subsequently, the two FMs feel a sizable IEC due to a spin-dependent interference by the filled states within the spacer, similar to the discussion in Fig. 1(a). We argue that the spin-dependent interference could be constructive or destructive depending on the electric-field controlled transmission coefficient, giving rise to a bias-dependent oscillation in IEC (see Fig."

Bias-dependent IEC through a reasonably thick single oxide barrier has been discussed theoretically via high voltage tunneling 33,34 and experimentally via mobile oxygen vacancies 7 . However, these mechanisms could be subject to higher power consumption, oxide breakdown, and/or long switching time determined by the slow migration of oxygen ions 35, 36 . Voltage induced transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic configuration and vice versa has been demonstrated on synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) structures using ionic liquid gating 37 , however, the configuration switches back once the voltage is removed. Similar electricfield induced modulation of the IEC in a SAF layer with an oxide gate has been discussed 38 and combined with the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy to demonstrate a bi-directional switch-ing. A different mechanism of manipulating the interlayer exchange coupling has recently been demonstrated 39 with an oxide spacer that is capable of exhibiting a metal-insulator transition upon temperature change.",

Here, we argue that the resonant tunneling via a QW formed within a non-magnetic material that exhibits a large IEC and will exploit the property of the material to enable a bias-dependent oscillation in IEC."

Such bias-dependent change in IEC sign will enable magnetization switching in both directions for the same voltage polarity (but different magnitudes), which is very different from existing mechanisms for electrical switching. We simulate with three consecutive voltage pulses across the structure, with pulse width of 5 ns each and pulse heights corresponding We start with an F configuration as the initial condition and show the z component of the magnetization vectors (m z1 for fixed and m z2 for free) as a function of time, in Fig. 2(b). The magnetization dynamics have been simulated with an exchanged coupled LLG model 13,14 assuming single domain magnets under zero external magnetic field and negligible spin current. The first pulse (P4) induces an AF IEC peak and switches the free magnet to make it AF with respect to the fixed magnet. The AF configuration is retained when the pulse is removed. The second pulse (P3) induces a F IEC peak which switches the free magnet back to a F configuration with respect to the fixed magnet. Again, the F configuration is retained when the pulse is removed.

The constant prefactors are deduced from empirical fitting which can be revisited as the field evolves, however, functional dependence on the parameters are benchmarked with detailed LLG simulations in the supplementary information. The switching time for magnets with in-plane anisotropies are also affected by the demagnetization field and can be analyzed directly using the LLG equation. Note that the switching time is lower for larger IEC energy which is similar to the STT-mechanism where a higher spin current yields a lower switching time 43 .

A sizable IEC strength persist even for reasonably high barrier heights contributed by the large number of states within the spacer metal, positioned below the Fermi level. However, the bias-dependent oscillatory nature of the IEC shifts toward the higher operating voltage as we increase the barrier height. We also noted from our simulations that for a given barrier height, an additional sharp oscillation peak can be observed at lower operating voltages which occurred due to a small mismatch of transmission coefficients for the parallel and the antiparallel configurations. This sharp oscillation shifts toward higher operating voltages linearly with the increasing barrier height and periodically reoccurs at the lower voltage side. For a given barrier height, the voltage window required to observe this sharp oscillation is very small as compared to the technological interest and further evaluation of this additional oscillation we leave as future work.",

It is interesting to note that the oscillation peaks occur at lower operating voltages for a thicker spacer layer, but the strength of the peaks decreases as well. The former is observed because the spacer layer thickness defines the QW width. An increase in the QW width lowers the discrete energy states as well as the spacing between two consecutive states. Thus the operating voltage to observe an IEC peak lowers with increasing spacer thickness. Similar lowering of QW energy states for wider QW and its consequence on the operating voltage has been discussed for double-barrier MTJ 41 . The later observation is due to the fact that the distance between two magnets is increasing with increased spacer thickness and the IEC strength weakens. Similar weakening of the IEC strength with increasing distance between the magnets has been discussed for spin-valve like geometries 15-17, 21, 22, 22, 23 ."
