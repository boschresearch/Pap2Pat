    "title": "Correcting Robot Plans with Natural Language Feedback",
    "date": "2022-04-11",
    "abstract": "When humans design cost or goal specifications for robots, they often produce specifications that are ambiguous, underspecified, or beyond planners' ability to solve. In these cases, corrections provide a valuable tool for human-in-the-loop robot control. Corrections might take the form of new goal specifications, new constraints (e.g. to avoid specific objects), or hints for planning algorithms (e.g. to visit specific waypoints). Existing correction methods (e.g. using a joystick or direct manipulation of an end effector) require full teleoperation or real-time interaction. In this paper, we explore natural language as an expressive and flexible tool for robot correction. We describe how to map from natural language sentences to transformations of cost functions. We show that these transformations enable users to correct goals, update robot motions to accommodate additional user preferences, and recover from planning errors. These corrections can be leveraged to get 81% and 93% success rates on tasks where the original planner failed, with either one or two language corrections. Our method makes it possible to compose multiple constraints and generalizes to unseen scenes, objects, and sentences in simulated environments and real-world environments.",

In the case of the robot in Figure 2, S is a tuple of all possible positions, velocities and accelerations the robot can achieve represented as (q, q, q). The action space A = {up,down,left,right}. Its \u2126 is the observed cost of states k-steps around the robot's current s. The tuple (s, a, o, T ) describes the robot's state s \u2208 S, action taken a \u2208 A, observations from the environment o \u2208 \u2126 and the task T that the robot needs to complete.

                "With increasing complexity of the environment and without assuming access to a model of the world, it is challenging to specify a C T that accurately reflects the task. An optimal cost function would be one that reflects the intended task, capturing the true cost-to-go. For example, the cost function corresponding to navigating to a goal could be approximated as the euclidean distance to goal. However, in many environments, as shown in Fig 1, greedily optimizing this objective will result in only a locally optimal solution that is completely misaligned with the human's intent. Misalignment due to misspecified goals and insufficient constraints can cause a plan failure. This problem of misalignment or a difference in the cost in the mind of the human C H and the robot C R is referred 1 Detailed specifications of C B can be found in the appendix A to as the value alignment problem [42]. Feedback from the human can be used to minimize the differences between C H and C R .

Whereas in the case of a constraints such as, go slower, this is a unit mask i.e. no-states are masked. This is done in-order to use a cue from the mask to help distinguish between changes in goals versus adding constraints to existing goals better.

In the case of constraint addition, the constraints are added to the P permanently (e.g., going faster, slower, staying away from an object). While optimizing, we keep track of the constraints in a set C LC to enable accounting over multiple constraints. In the case of goal specification, there are two cases in which a goal may be specified, first, in the absence of any previous goal and second, as a way to correct the model by introducing intermediate goals. In the first case, there is no existing goal cost and C L becomes the only active goal cost alongside the other constraints. In the second mode we deactivate the task cost C T and wait until C L is within a threshold before activating the original task cost C T back again. This temporary activation mode is used where L specifies an intermediate goal directive. The M along with the presence or absence of an existing C T is indicative of the mode of correction. A L with a M == 1 is always a constraint and that with a M = 1 is a goal directive. We interface our C L with an optimization based controller [7] to generate commands for the robot as shown in Algorithm 1. Architecture fig."

The position of each object is sampled uniformly within the bounds of the environment. We sample object orientation from one of four equally-spaced options. We render each environment with the NVIDIA Scene Imaging Interface (NViSII) [26]. Images are top-down and are of size (2048, 2048) pixels. For every environment, we uniformly sample 10 different collision-free start positions.

In our setting, the planner failed 6.4% of the time. More details on the planner is described in appendix A.

Before, the robot moves dangerously close to the glass containers; after \"go through the bottom of spam\", it avoids them and maintains a safe distance. Fig. 9: The language correction module is trained with templated language instructions. For example, to teach the robot to go over an object, we use the template \"Go to the top of the X,\" where X is the name of an object that can be referred to in several ways.

To make such a correction with other means such as a joystick or kinesthetic feedback would require considerable time and effort. Importantly, corrections do not always need to be provided only in the case of a planner failure, but can be used by the user to modify the plan based on their preference. In Figure 8 we see a human providing a correction to steer the robot away from fragile objects. This correction is applied to the task of placing an object in the mug."

Broad et al. [10] use a grounding model based on a Distributed Correspondence Graph [18] to ground corrections, which limits grounding language to a hand-engineered set of optimization constraints. In contrast, we directly learn to predict cost maps using a neural network, side-stepping the potentially laborious constraint design process. Co-Reyes et al. [12] learn a policy that accepts corrections in addition to an instruction, however it requires training with corrections at training time which makes it sample inefficient as number of tasks scale. Further, it does not permit decoupling the notions of a goal and a trajectory to said goal when issuing a correction. Karamcheti et al. [21] use language to disambiguate underspecified joystick corrections by learning a mapping to robot joint space. This suffers from the same limitations as language-free joystick [36,33] or kinesthetic [6] corrections, requiring undivided user attention. Furthermore, their language grounding model is based on a nearest-neighbour lookup, which does not generalize to new environments and tasks.",

Mapping language to symbolic plans [37,22,24,4], has enabled following instructions by invoking a set of prespecified skills or motion primitives. Recently, instruction following has been studied in robotics by mapping instructions and raw visual observations to actions using end-toend representation learning and sim-to-real transfer [8,2,35]. All of these works, however, treat language instructions as goals that are fixed during execution. In contrast, by framing language grounding as cost prediction, we enable the use of language to refine robot behavior over time, while still allowing instruction-following as a special use-case.",

This is related to Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) [1] that learns to recover reward functions from demonstrations, and has been successfully applied to infer objectives for manipulation motion planners [20]. In contrast, our cost model is conditioned on language and visual observations, which enables re-using the same model with diverse language corrections in a variety of tasks.",

Our language corrections enable interactively updating the cost to better reflect the task. This problem has been also addressed by learning to predict true rewards given observed rewards across environments and tasks [16], and by learning from physical interactions with humans [5]."

This is done by modelling cost associated with the language instruction C L conditioned on the language feedback L. The C L can be used in conjunction with the motion planner's existing costs. We train our model on data generated via simulation and evaluate the performance of the model in various out of distribution settings in the real world involving non-templated natural user commands, cluttered scenes, new poses and types of objects. We use STORM [7] as the planner which computes an action leveraging sampling based optimization to optimize over costs. The base cost C B for the 2D simulation robot contains the following terms: C collision (q t ) = Coll(q t , o h )",

Here we understand when the correction module fails. We group trajectories into easy medium and hard based on the length of the trajectories. It can be seen that corrections with longer trajectories are much worse than corrections with shorter trajectories. The main insight is that despite having a limited correcting ability one can still use it to make simple modifications at once or sequentially to correct behaviors. analysis Fig. 13: Convergence to Goal Analysis: a) As discussed in the results section the planner does better at short-horizon tasks as compared to long horizon tasks. The interesting aspect of the model is that even for long-horizon tasks, the first part of the trajectory does move in a direction where the goal is minimised for several steps. Even a model for CL with varying performance across short and long horizon corrections can still do well on introducing corrections that improve planner performance b) The advantage of generating a mask M over the cost is most evident for medium to long trajectories."
