    "abstract": "A system and method of self-calibrated correction for residual phase in phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) imaging data. The method includes receiving PCMR image data from an MR scanner system, segmenting static tissue from non-static cardiovascular elements of the image data, calculating a non-linear fitted-phase basis function, the non-linear fitted-phase basis function based on system artifacts of the PCMR system, adding the non-linear fitted-phase basis function to linear fit terms, and subtracting the result of the adding step from the PCMR imaging data. The system includes a PCMR scanning apparatus configured to provide PCMR image data, a scanner control circuit configured to control the scanning apparatus during image acquisition, the scanner control circuitry in communication with a control processor, the control processor configured to execute computer-readable instructions that cause the control processor to perform the method.

                        "Blood flow and velocity through the cardiovascular system can be used to diagnose disorders, such as congenital heart disease and valve abnormalities. Accurate diagnosis of these disorders requires obtaining both qualitative assessment and accurate quantitative measurement of the blood velocity. Magnetic resonance (MR) is one tool used to measure the blood velocity.",
                        "Phase-contrast Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) is typically used to provide such accurate blood velocity measurements. Typically, velocity-encoded gradient waveforms are used to provide encoding of the velocity in the phase of the MR image. When compared against an un-encoded MR image, the difference in phase is proportional to the velocity. In addition, it is also often necessary to calibrate this velocity to a zero velocity baseline reference\u2014e.g., that from stationary tissue adjacent to a blood vessel. However, such calibration is difficult to perform in CMR of the heart and great vessels because often there is no, or minimal, stationary tissue adjacent to the heart and large blood vessels. Therefore, uncorrected velocity offsets may introduce substantial errors in velocity flow quantification.",
                        "Background phase bias due to presence of eddy-currents and random noise can also adversely affect the quality of MR phase velocity measurements. Conventionally, background phase bias can be reduced by identifying static tissue within the phase contrast image. This criterion for static tissue is determined by calculating time standard deviations of the phase velocity images over a cardiac cycle, and identifying as static regions those portions with a low standard deviation. Because the vessels, or objects, of interest are far from static, using a conventional, linear-fitted velocity correction can result in under-fitting. Conversely, fitting with higher spatial orders can result in over-fitting because of the lack of data points near the vessels or objects of interest. The choice of basis functions for these higher spatial orders is not generally based on physical properties of the MRI scanner."

                        "In accordance with embodiments, a self-calibrated correction for the residual phase in phase-contrast MRI can use a nonlinear fit of the phase in static tissue. In accordance with implementations, the fitted phase can then be applied to the non-static vascular components of the MR image by subtracting the fitted phase from the phase obtained from phase-contrast MRI. Embodying systems and methods apply one predetermined nonlinear term to the fitting basis functions to achieve the nonlinear fitting\u2014the nonlinear spatial basis of the fitted phase is fixed. The nonlinear basis is added to the linear fit terms. For three dimensions, there can be five terms to be determined in the fit. These are a constant, X, Y, Z, and a nonlinear term\u2014where X, Y, and Z are the spatial coordinates of the relevant pixels of the image. One physical property of the scanner that can be used is the concomitant field, resulting in an added nonlinear basis function, which has been observed to be very similar to the residual background phase. Another nonlinear basis function can be a predetermined eddy current field map. In accordance with some embodiments, the fitted result can be improved by other features\u2014for example, iterative outlier removal of tissue boundaries; inclusion of the quiescent phase for fitting; and/or effect-size weighting to reduce over-fitting.",
                        "This nonlinear self-calibrated approach relies on knowing the nonlinear shape. Empirical observation shows that the residual phase is similar in shape to that of the concomitant field. Therefore as compared to linear fitting that uses for basis functions four terms (constant, X, Y, and Z), the hybrid, nonlinear-fit, in accordance with embodiments, has an added basis function of the concomitant field, resulting in five terms. The fit can be further improved by iteratively removing outliers that occur at tissue boundaries during the static-tissue segmentation. Further, added static-tissue segmentation can be performed using velocities from the quiescent cardiac phase, which can result in a fit that includes the velocities from both the averaged phase and the quiescent phase.",
                        "In accordance with some implementations, the corrected phase can be weighted by the effect size of the fit to contain over-fitting so as to improve the accuracy of the fitted result. For example, one implementation to determine the effect size of the fit can be to compare the distribution of the fitted phase against a predetermined, desired upper and lower limit of a predetermined, desired velocity accuracy. If the distribution of the fitted phase falls within the predetermined, desired accuracy limits, a small weight is assigned. If the distribution falls outside the limits, a large weight is assigned. One way to determine whether this distribution falls inside or outside the limits is by simply considering the ratio (or probability) of pixels within these limits to all pixels. In one implementation, the assigned weight can be the probability of the fitted phase exceeding previously-proposed velocity specification limits of about +/\u22126 mm/sec\u2014i.e., if the fitted phase has a small effect, no correction is done.",
                        "In accordance with some embodiments, the workflow of phase contrast correction can be improved with the application of this self-calibrated correction. The nonlinear spatial basis can result in improved accuracy of the phase fit as compared to a linear fit or a nonlinear fit with an arbitrary number of nonlinear terms. This in turn yields an improved accuracy of the corrected phase contrast velocity maps. Fixing the nonlinear basis can prevent statistical overfitting of the phase, as compared to allowing for numerous higher-order spatial terms. This nonlinear basis for fitting is superior to linear basis only, as linear will result in under-fitting",
                        "FIG. 1 depicts velocity map images 100A-F in accordance with some embodiments. Velocity map images 100A-F includes 2D CINE-PC velocity maps from static phantom (100A-C) and in-vivo scans (100D-F). To obtain these images, twelve normal subjects were imaged at 3 T and 1.5 T with 2D CINE-PC using varying imaging parameters, yielding thirty-one phase contrast (PC) images. Images 100A, 100D have no fitting applied; images 100B, 100E have only linear fitting; and images 100C, 100F have hybrid, nonlinear fitting in accordance with some embodiments. The static phantom images provide a set of baseline images as ground truth for comparison purposes. Any residual motion in the assumed static-phantom and any possible thermal-drift in the MRI system may bias phantom results; hence, a phantom calibration approach using a direct subtraction of the phantom phase may be neither feasible nor accurate. The linear-fitting resulted in reduced residual velocity in static tissue and in the phantom. A further reduction in residual velocity from application of the hybrid, nonlinear fitting, in accordance with embodiments, can be observed in images 100C, 100F.",
                        "FIG. 2 depicts plots 200 of percentage of pixels within a predetermined velocity limit in accordance with some embodiments. By way of example, the predetermined velocity limit for plots 200 is +/\u22126 mm/sec. However, other values for the predetermined velocity limits are equally available for implementation.",
                        "Plots 200 represent the percentage of pixels within +/\u22126 mm/sec velocity limits as obtained from the measurements (i.e., with no fitting, linear-only fitting, and hybrid, nonlinear fitting) of the thirty-one CINE phase-contrast images of FIG. 1. Twenty-seven images were acquired from eleven subjects at 3 T (solid line plots) and four images were acquired from one subject at 1.5 T (dashed line plots).",
                        "Plots 200 show that an embodying hybrid, nonlinear-fitting was overall superior to the other two methods in providing a higher percentage of pixels within the predetermined, desired velocity limits. The data points of plots 200 were connected (no-fitting, linear-fitting and hybrid nonlinear-fitting) to demonstrate that nonlinear was superior to the other two methods, even in data points with high percentages with no-fitting and linear-fitting. FIG. 2 depicts that of the images with no fitting, about 13% of the instances have greater than about 90% pixels within a 4-cm radius of iso-center within the velocity limits. With linear fitting, about 22.5% of the instances have greater than about 90% of pixels within the velocity limits.",
                        "As depicted in FIG. 2, the linear fitting has a detrimental impact on about fourteen of the instances (compared to their respective no fitting instances). However, as depicted in FIG. 2, with hybrid, nonlinear fitting in accordance with some embodiments, about 81% of the instances have greater than about 90% of pixels within the velocity limits\u2014including providing a marked improvement from their respective linear fitting instances. Accordingly, the measurements show that the hybrid, nonlinear fitting in accordance with some embodiments, is superior to both the no-fitting, and the linear-fitting examples.",
