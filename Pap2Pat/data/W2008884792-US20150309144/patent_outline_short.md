# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce phase-contrast Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) and its limitations

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce self-calibrated correction for residual phase in phase-contrast MRI
- describe nonlinear fit of phase in static tissue
- explain application of fitted phase to non-static vascular components
- describe use of concomitant field and eddy current field maps
- discuss iterative outlier removal and quiescent phase inclusion
- describe weighting of corrected phase by effect size
- illustrate velocity map images with no fitting, linear fitting, and hybrid nonlinear fitting
- depict plots of percentage of pixels within predetermined velocity limits
