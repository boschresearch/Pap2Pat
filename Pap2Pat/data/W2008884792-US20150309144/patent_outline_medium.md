# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce phase-contrast Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR)
- limitations of conventional velocity correction methods

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce self-calibrated correction for residual phase in phase-contrast MRI
- describe nonlinear fit of phase in static tissue
- apply fitted phase to non-static vascular components
- embodying systems and methods
- add nonlinear basis function to linear fit terms
- describe concomitant field and eddy current field maps
- improve fit with iterative outlier removal and quiescent phase
- weight corrected phase by effect size of fit
- describe workflow of phase contrast correction
- depict velocity map images
- plot percentage of pixels within predetermined velocity limit
- describe MRI system configured to implement self-calibrated correction method
- depict process for performing self-calibrated correction method
- expand static tissue segmentation with iterative removal of outliers
- expand static tissue segmentation using quiescent cardiac phase
- combine linear and nonlinear phases
