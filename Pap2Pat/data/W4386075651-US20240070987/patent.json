    "abstract": "Transferring pose to three-dimensional characters is a common computer graphics task that typically involves transferring the pose of a reference avatar to a (stylized) three-dimensional character. Since three-dimensional characters are created by professional artists through imagination and exaggeration, and therefore, unlike human or animal avatars, have distinct shape and features, matching the pose of a three-dimensional character to that of a reference avatar generally requires manually creating shape information for the three-dimensional character that is required for pose transfer. The present disclosure provides for the automated transfer of a reference pose to a three-dimensional character, based specifically on a learned shape code for the three-dimensional character.",

                        "Different from the three-dimensional models of natural humans and animals, three-dimensional characters are usually created (e.g. by professional artists) through imagination and exaggeration. As a result, each character has a distinct skeleton, shape, mesh topology, and may include various accessories, such as a cloak or wings. These variations from natural humans and animals hinder the process of matching the pose of a three-dimensional character to that of a reference human/animal avatar, generally making manual rigging a requirement. However, rigging is a tedious process that, to date, has required manually creating the skeleton and skinning weights for each character. Even when provided with manually annotated rigs, transferring poses from a driving avatar onto three-dimensional characters is not trivial when the source (avatar) and target (character) skeletons differ.",

The pose deformation process could benefit from learning part correspondence. For example, some three-dimensional characters may have headgear, hats, and horns on their heads. If these components can be \u201cunderstood\u201d as extensions of the character's heads by their shape codes, they will move smoothly with the character's heads during pose deformation.

Specifically, the shape understanding module 400 may utilize an MLP P to additionally predict a part label px=(px1, . . . , pxK)T\u2208K for each surface point x.

However, as there is no part segmentation annotation for stylized characters, a self-supervised inverse constraint may be used to facilitate part segmentation prediction on these characters. Specifically, the query point's coordinates may be reconstructed from the concatenation of the shape code s and the embedding e through an MLP Q and an auxiliary objective may be added as in Equation 3:",

This facilitates faster training and provides robustness to overfitting. Furthermore, human poses can be successfully estimated from different modalities (e.g., videos or meshes), and mapped to the latent space. By taking advantage of these configurations, the model used by the pose deformation module 500 can be applied to transfer poses from various modalities to an unrigged stylized character without any additional effort.",

Instead, the Euclidean distance between pairs of vertices sampled from the surface of the mesh is preserved, as a proxy for constraining the volume.

Deep learning is a technique that models the neural learning process of the human brain, continually learning, continually getting smarter, and delivering more accurate results more quickly over time. A child is initially taught by an adult to correctly identify and classify various shapes, eventually being able to identify shapes without any coaching. Similarly, a deep learning or neural learning system needs to be trained in object recognition and classification for it get smarter and more efficient at identifying basic objects, occluded objects, etc., while also assigning context to objects.",
                                "At the simplest level, neurons in the human brain look at various inputs that are received, importance levels are assigned to each of these inputs, and output is passed on to other neurons to act upon. An artificial neuron or perceptron is the most basic model of a neural network. In one example, a perceptron may receive one or more inputs that represent various features of an object that the perceptron is being trained to recognize and classify, and each of these features is assigned a certain weight based on the importance of that feature in defining the shape of an object.",
                                "A deep neural network (DNN) model includes multiple layers of many connected nodes (e.g., perceptrons, Boltzmann machines, radial basis functions, convolutional layers, etc.) that can be trained with enormous amounts of input data to quickly solve complex problems with high accuracy. In one example, a first layer of the DNN model breaks down an input image of an automobile into various sections and looks for basic patterns such as lines and angles. The second layer assembles the lines to look for higher level patterns such as wheels, windshields, and mirrors. The next layer identifies the type of vehicle, and the final few layers generate a label for the input image, identifying the model of a specific automobile brand.",
                                "Once the DNN is trained, the DNN can be deployed and used to identify and classify objects or patterns in a process known as inference. Examples of inference (the process through which a DNN extracts useful information from a given input) include identifying handwritten numbers on checks deposited into ATM machines, identifying images of friends in photos, delivering movie recommendations to over fifty million users, identifying and classifying different types of automobiles, pedestrians, and road hazards in driverless cars, or translating human speech in real-time.",
                                "During training, data flows through the DNN in a forward propagation phase until a prediction is produced that indicates a label corresponding to the input. If the neural network does not correctly label the input, then errors between the correct label and the predicted label are analyzed, and the weights are adjusted for each feature during a backward propagation phase until the DNN correctly labels the input and other inputs in a training dataset. Training complex neural networks requires massive amounts of parallel computing performance, including floating-point multiplications and additions. Inferencing is less compute-intensive than training, being a latency-sensitive process where a trained neural network is applied to new inputs it has not seen before to classify images, translate speech, and generally infer new information.",
