    "abstract": "A resource allocation algorithm for orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based and infrastructure-based relay networks is introduced in this paper. The algorithm is applied in the downlink of a single cell. Channel state information is exploited at the transmitting base station (BS) and at the transmitting relay stations (RSs). The algorithm coordinates the allocation of subcarriers, bits, and power distributed over the BS and RSs. The goal of the resource allocation algorithm is that the sum rate in a cell is maximized. Simultaneously, each subscriber station (SS) achieves a requested data rate called minimum data rate, and a tolerated bit error probability is ensured on each link. Simulation results show that a sum rate in a cell is achieved which is near to an upper bound introduced in the paper. Even if the sum of the minimum data rates of all SSs is large, the proposed algorithm offers the minimum data rate nearly as reliable as the upper bound. Additionally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a superior sum rate compared to the sum rate of other resource allocation algorithms.",

                "Two promising techniques are expected in future cellular networks: transmissions using a fixed relay station (RS) [1] and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) [2].",
                "Transmissions using an RS bring various benefits in future cellular networks: such a type of transmission enables a coverage extension of a base station (BS), capacity enhancement in a cell or cost reduction compared to conventional cellular networks [1,3,4]. A subscriber station (SS) is connected either directly to a BS or via an RS which is connected to a BS. Like the BS, the RSs are part of the infrastructure. This kind of network is called infrastructurebased relay network.",
                "OFDMA is a multiple access scheme applied in various wireless systems like IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802. 16 and is a promising candidate for future cellular networks, for example, accepted for 3GPP LTE [5] and in the European Union research project WINNER [6]. An advantage of OFDMA is the flexibility concerning the allocation of the resources power and subcarriers in a multiuser environment [7,8]. If the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, OFDMA enables an adaptive allocation of the resources to the links of a network taking into account quality of service (QoS) parameters requested by higher layer protocols like a requested data rate or a tolerated bit error probability. A cross-layer design of the allocation of subcarriers at the medium access control layer and a suitable choice of the transmit power and the used modulation scheme on the physical layer improve the performance of an OFDMA system [2]. Hence, various cross-layer methods exist for OFDMA systems dealing with the allocation of resources, for instance, given in [2,[9][10][11][12]. However, these methods are limited to conventional cellular networks in which no RSs are deployed.",
                "Using OFDMA in a relay network combines the benefits of both techniques and a growing interest. In this paper, the downlink of a cell in an OFDMA-based relay network is considered. A cell consists of a BS, several RSs, and SSs. An RS decodes a message received by the BS and forwards the re-encoded message to the dedicated SS. Compared to methods for the adaptive allocation of resources in a cell of a conventional cellular network, the allocation in a cell of a relay network leads to several new challenging problems. The CSI must be obtained by the BS and the RSs. If an RS knows the CSI of its served RS-to-SS links, it is not ensured that the BS is aware of this CSI. In comparison to a cell of a conventional network, the CSI of all links in the downlink of a cell can be distributed over several transmitters. The allocation of resources must be coordinated between the BS and the RSs. For instance, the allocation must be coordinated to balance the data rate on a BS-to-RS link and on the corresponding RS-to-SS links. QoS requirements must be fulfilled for all connections demanding a coordination such that the QoS requirements are fullfilled on the BS-to-RS links and RS-to-SS links for the connections of the SSs assigned to a RS. Coordination always means a signaling overhead which degrades the efficient use of resources. The allocation of resources must take into account that the costs of an RS are kept low in order to exploit the advantages of a relay network in terms of costs [4,13].",
                "In literature, a few methods exist which deal with the allocation of resources in relay networks using OFDMA. In [14], a method is proposed which aims at maximizing the sum rate in a cell by adaptive subcarrier allocation and adaptive power loading on the multiple links in a cell of a relay network. In [15], a resource allocation method for a relay network is presented which minimizes the transmit power of the BS and the RSs subject to the constraint that each SS achieves a minimum data rate. The methods presented in [14,15] require the short-term CSI of all links at a central point in the cell, for example, the BS. Since the short-term CSI of all RS-to-SS link must be reported to the BS, a high signaling overhead is expected for these methods.",
                "In [16], a resource allocation method is presented for mesh networks in which typically an RS is not part of the infrastructure but SSs act as RSs. The allocation of resources is executed over the transmitters. Based on long-term CSI and based on knowledge of the traffic per transmitter, a central unit, for example, a BS, allocates the number of subcarriers to the links. Each transmitter performs the power allocation to its subcarriers. The short-term CSI of all links is not required at a central point which is a promising approach to reduce signaling overhead. The resource allocation method is proved to be proportional fair [17]. Since an RS receives and transmits simultaneously, strong intercarrier interference is expected at an RS.",
                "In [18], various resource allocation methods are presented for relay networks aiming at a reduction of the signaling overhead between an RS and a BS. In all methods, the CSI of all subcarriers and of all RS-to-SS links is not forwarded to the BS. Instead, the RS allocates subcarriers to its RS-to-SS links and requests packets from the BS which will be transmitted over the BS-to-RS link. The methods presented in [18] allocate subcarriers and choose a modulation and coding scheme according to a proportional fair metric. Since the methods given in [16,18] are based on the proportional fair criterion, a fair distribution of data rates related to a requested data rate is achieved but the fairness is paid by a reduction of the sum rate in the cell.",
                "In [19], subcarriers and a modulation and coding scheme are allocated in order to maximize the sum of data rates. As in [18], the RS requests packets from the BS but QoS requirements are not considered.",
                "In this paper, a novel resource allocation algorithm is introduced for the downlink in a cell of an OFDMA-based relay network. The goal of the resource allocation algorithm is that the sum rate in a cell is maximized subjected to the consideration of two QoS requirements of each connection. The first QoS requirement is that a requested data rate called minimum data rate is achieved. The second one is that a tolerated bit error probability is ensured. The goal and the constraints of the resource allocation algorithm are chosen since they promise a good trade-off between fairness and system performance as introduced in [20]. On the one hand, a maximization of the sum rate in a cell not taking into account QoS requirements leads to an unfair distribution of the data rates among the SSs. On the other hand, a maximization of the sum rate taking into account a strict fairness criterion, for example, the proportional fair criterion, leads to a reduction of the sum rate in the cell. The proposed resource allocation algorithm operates distributed over the BS and RSs in a cell to overcome the drawback of high signaling. The transmissions of the BS and the RSs are separated in time domain so that an RS does not receive and transmit simultaneously. The BS and the RSs are allocated adaptively slots of a frame by applying the algorithm. The allocation of the slots to the BS and RSs depends on the CSI and on the offered data rate. The BS and the RSs allocate subcarriers to their served links using the CSI. The power allocated to a subcarrier by the BS or an RS is allocated such that a chosen number of bits is successfully transmitted according to a tolerated bit error probability. The allocation of subcarriers, bits, and power is described by a linear integer programs. Since these programs are NP-hard, suboptimal algorithms are proposed to solve these problems enabling a near optimum solution at low complexity.",
                "The outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, a system model is introduced. In the system model, two types of CSI are defined and the assumptions which transmitter knows the CSI of a link in a cell are given. Section 3 presents the novel coordinated resource allocation algorithm. The presented algorithm demands that two different subcarrier, bit, and power allocation problems described as linear integer programs are solved at the BS and at the RSs. Algorithms solving these problems are presented in Section 4. In Section 5, an evaluation of the presented algorithm is given by a comparison to other algorithms using simulation results. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6."

A link in the considered cell is represented by (t, l), where t is the index of a transmitter, namely, the BS for t = 0 and an RS for 1 \u2264 t \u2264 N RS . A receiver is represented by the index l. The receiver is an RS for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 N RS and an SS for",
                "An RS can be a transmitter or a receiver, but it cannot transmit and receive simultaneously. The receivers served by a transmitter t are grouped in the set L t . The SSs assigned to a BS use a direct connection consisting of one link. These SSs are grouped in the set L 1hop . The SSs assigned to an RS use a two-hop connection consisting of two links and are given by the set L 2hop .",
                "A frame-based OFDMA transmission is considered. A frame consists of S slots. A slot is defined as a single OFDM symbol in the rest of this paper. The transmissions of the BS and the RSs are separated by TDMA. Within a frame, a number of consecutive slots called subframe is allocated to each transmitter. The first subframe is used by the BS and the others by the RSs. Either the BS or an RS of the cell transmits during a subframe. The BS and an RS or two RSs do not transmit simultaneously. On the one hand, simultaneous transmissions within a cell can increase the sum rate in the cell if the reuse distance is sufficiently large. On the other hand, if the reuse distance is small, cochannel interference reduces the sum rate. A transmission in which the BS and RSs send in a consecutive order is inefficient if a large number of transmitters per cell exist. Thus, the algorithm proposed in this paper is more suitable to deployments considering a small number of RSs per BS and to scenarios in which a large reuse distance in a cell is not given. Frequencies are reused in such a network by transmitters in different cells. Within a subframe, the transmissions of different links are separated by FDMA, that is, each subcarrier is assigned to one link uniquely. The total number of subcarriers in the system is N SC . The subcarrier spacing is chosen such that the channel can be considered as flat for each subcarrier.",
                "In this paper, two types of CSI are considered. The first type is called short-term CSI and is defined as the ratio of the squared absolute value of the instantaneous channel coefficient represented by \u03b1 2 t,l,n and the noise power \u03c3 2 t,l,n on a link (t, l) and on a subcarrier n, where n = 1, 2, . . . , N SC . Cochannel interference created in other cells is modeled by a Gaussian process and included in the noise power \u03c3 2 t,l,n . The short-term CSI is affected by path loss, shadowing, and fast fading effects. It is assumed that the short-term CSI is not time varying for the duration of a frame. This is an appropriate assumption if the duration of a frame is smaller than the coherence time of the channel. The second type of CSI is called long-term CSI and is defined as the expectation value of the short-term CSI of a link, where the expectation value is taken over all subcarriers and a long time period compared to the coherence time. The long-term CSI is affected by the path loss and shadowing effects. Assuming a time invariant channel, the long-term CSI is given by E n {\u03b1 2 t,l,n /\u03c3 2 t,l,n }, where E n {\u2022} represents the expectation value taken over the subcarriers.",
                "If a transmitter knows the short-term CSI of the links to the assigned stations, adaptive subcarrier, bit and power allocation is possible. If only long-term CSI is known, subcarriers must be allocated to links and the bits and the power must be loaded on a subcarrier without exploiting knowledge about the channels of single subcarriers. Compared to an allocation based on long-term CSI, a gain in terms of data rate is expected for an adaptive allocation taking into account short-term CSI [2,9]. The price to be paid for this gain is that the short-term CSI must be obtained and be reported to a transmitter. In a time division duplex (TDD) system, the BS or an RS can estimate the short-term CSI of a link to an assigned station from the received uplink signal. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, the downlink receiver must report the short-term CSI to the BS or an RS leading to a signaling overhead. In order to reduce signaling, adjacent subcarriers which are affected by a strongly correlated channel can be grouped in a resource block [21]. The channel of a resource block can be represented by the channel of a single subcarrier of the resource block. For simplicity, only single subcarriers are considered in this paper instead of resource blocks.",
                "If the BS will have short-term CSI about the RS-to-SS links, the RS must forward the short-term CSI about the RS-to-SS links to the BS leading to a signaling overhead of N SC parameters per RS-to-SS link. In this paper, the BS is assumed to know the short-term CSI on all subcarriers n of all links (0, l) and the long-term CSI of all links (0, l) for which l \u2208 L 0 . An RS t knows the short-term CSI on all subcarriers n of all links (t, l) and the long-term CSI of all links (t, l) for which l \u2208 L t . The BS has no CSI about the RS-to-SS links to avoid a large signaling overhead.",

The number of bits loaded on a subcarrier is c. The possible values of c are given as the elements of a set called D. Considering that also zero bits can be allocated to a subcarrier, the set is given by D = {0, 2, 4, 6} according to the modulation schemes. The function f t,l,n (c) describes the required receive power on a subcarrier n for the reception of c bits per symbol according to a noise power \u03c3 2 t,l,n and a maximally tolerated bit error probability \u03c1 t,l on link (t, l).

This connection is called best connection. The best connection is allocated as much slots, subcarriers, and power as possible.",

Only one connection directly served by the BS or by an RS is chosen to be allocated the remaining resources because if the best connection is a two-hop connection the BS has only CSI of a single RS-to-SS link of each RS. Since the BS knows neither the short-term CSI of all links nor the results of the subcarrier, bit, and power allocations of the RSs, the BS cannot determine the exact data rate achieved on a link. Instead, the Shannon capacity formula and the average SNR \u03b3 t,l at a receiver of a link (t, l) are used to compare the connections and to find the best connection.

According to constraint (9c), the BS allocates subcarriers and power on the corresponding BSto-RS link such that the data rate of this link is equal to or larger than the sum of the data rates allocated by the RS on its served RS-to-SS links. The data rate of a BS-to-RS link can be too large because only a discrete number of subcarriers are allocated to a link and a discrete number of bits are loaded on a subcarrier. The number of bits which cannot be forwarded in the subframe of the RS is upper bounded by S 0 max{D}. However, this number of bits is quite small related to the total number of transmitted bits in a frame if the number of subcarriers is large. If an RS serves the best connection, the BS cannot know exactly the data rate on the RS-to-SS link and is unable to balance the data rate on the BS-to-RS link and RS-to-SS link.

As in the coordinated resource allocation algorithm, a frame is split into three subframes but each subframe has a fixed size. Three cases of the static algorithm are considered because the performance of the static algorithm depends on the sizes of the subframes. In the first one, the subframe in which the BS transmits has a size of 34 slots. Each of the other two subframes has a size of 33 slots. This case represents an algorithm in which each transmitter is allocated the same number of slots. In the second case, the BS is allocated 50 slots and each of the RSs 25 slots. The BS is allocated more slots than a RS in order to consider that resources are required for the BS-to-RS links. In the third case, the BS is assigned 68 slots and each RS 16 slots. The motivation for this allocation is to maximize the sum rate for a large number of SSs. The subframe of the BS is quite large in order to achieve a high sum rate on average since the direct connections achieve a higher data rate than the two hop connections on average. The drawback is that this case of the algorithm fails if the number of SSs assigned to a RS is high. In the static algorithm, the BS and RSs apply the same algorithm for subcarrier allocation and for bit and power loading as in the coordinated resource allocation algorithm. First a RS solves (7a), (7b), (7c), and (7d). The BS finds the best connection and solves (9a), (9b), (9c), and (9d). If a RS is not serving the best connection, only the sum of the minimum data rates of the SSs assigned to the RS is allocated to the corresponding BS-to-RS link. The subcarriers and the power not required by the BS to serve the minimum data rates are completely given to the best connection. If a RS is serving the best connection, the problem defined in (9a), (9b), (9c), and (9d) is also solved at this RS.

In Figure 5, the mean value of the sum rate called average sum rate is given for the algorithms depending on the number N SS of SSs which are considered in a frame. Additionally, the sum of the minimum data rates in the system is given. All Average sum rate in bits per frame considered SSs fulfilled the admission control. Each SS has a minimum data rate of 2560 bits per frame. Thus, the amount of requested data rate increases linearly and the subcarriers and slots available for the best connection decrease with an increasing number of SSs. Only frames are considered for an algorithm in which the minimum data rate is offered to all SSs, that is, an algorithm does not fail and the frame building is successful. Only results of an algorithm are shown for which the ratio of failures in the frame building related to the total number of simulated frames is below 5% to avoid that the average sum rate is too optimistic. The static algorithms achieve a low average sum rate. Only a low number of SSs can be served since the static algorithms fail if a high number of SSs or SSs using a robust modulation are assigned to a single RS or BS. For instance, two SSs which load each subcarrier with two bits require 20 slots to achieve their minimum data rate. A comparison of the static algorithms shows that the algorithm applying a subframe size of 16 slots achieves a higher average sum rate than the other static algorithms since the BS is allocated more slots.",
                        "The coordinated resource allocation algorithm called CRAA in the figures and the upper bound algorithm have a similar behavior depending on the number of SSs. For a high number of SSs, a SS can be found more probably which achieves a high data rate on the best connection. Thus, the average sum rate depending on the number of SS increases for a small number of SSs. If the number of SSs increases further, more resources are occupied to provide the minimum data rates and less resources are available for the best connection maximizing the sum rate. Thus, the average sum rate decreases for large number of SSs. The average sum rate of the coordinated resource allocation algorithm is more than 87% of the one of the upper bound algorithm. This result shows that the performance degradation due to the suboptimal greedy algorithms for the subcarrier allocation and the bit and power loading is quite small compared to an optimal solution of the problems defined in (7a), (7b), (7c), and (7d) and (9a), (9b), (9c), and (9d).

As expected, the static algorithms have a high rate of failure even for a small number of SSs. The static algorithms using a subframe size of 33 slots and a subframe size of 25 slots for the RS outperform the other static algorithm. The coordinated resource allocation algorithm supplies nearly the double number of SSs since the subframe sizes are adapted to the demand of slots of the transmitters. Approximately two additional SSs can be served by the upper bound algorithm compared to the coordinated  resource allocation algorithm as shown in Figure 6. The reason is that the upper bound algorithm achieves an average sum rate which is roughly 6000 bits per frame larger than the average sum rate of the coordinated resource allocation algorithm according to Figure 5. In Figure 7, the average sum rate is given for the algorithms depending on the number of SSs assuming a minimum data rate of 640 bits per frame. Especially, the static algorithms improve in terms of a higher number of SSs which can be served compared to Figure 5 since the minimum data rate per SS is smaller. The coordinated resource allocation algorithm achieves a gain of more than 15% in terms of average sum rate compared to the best static algorithm. The gap between the upper bound algorithm and the coordinated resource allocation algorithm slightly increases because the degradation of the greedy algorithms is stronger if more possibilities of allocations of subcarriers, bits and power exist.",

The rate depends on the number of SSs assuming a minimum data rate of 640 bits per frame. The static algorithm using a subframe size of 16 slots is feasible for the same number of SSs nearly as often as the other static algorithm. Since the motivation of the subframe splitting 68, 16 and 16 slots is to maximize the average sum rate for a large number of SSs, the feasibility is improved for a large number of SSs with a low minimum data rate. The static algorithms serve more SSs than in Figure 6. Figure 8 shows that the coordinated resource allocation algorithm serves approximately 20 SSs more than the static algorithms. The upper bound algorithm serves approximately 12 more SSs than the coordinated.",
                        "Since the SSs which are not chosen as a best connection achieve approximately their minimum data rate, only the data rate of the SS related to the best connection is affected by strong variations. In Figure 9 the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the data rates r t,lbest of the best connection are illustrated for the five algorithms. The number of SSs considered in a frame is five. The CDFs of the static algorithms using a subframe size of 16 slots and of 25 slots, the coordinated resource allocation algorithm and the upper bound algorithm contain a step at the value of the CDF of approximately 0.18. The step reveals that roughly 18% of the best connections are two hop connections. Since a best connection which is a two hop connection requires slots for the BS-to-RS link and for the RS-to-SS link, the data rate of a two hop best connection is smaller than the data rate of a direct best connection. Since the number of SSs considered in the frame is quite small, the variances of these four CDFs are large. The static algorithm using a subframe size of 33 slots leads to a small variance of the data rate because the number of slots available for the best connection is too small. In Figure 10, the CDFs of the data rates of the best connections is given assuming that the number of SSs is 21. The probability that the best connection is a direct connection is nearly one. For instance, this can be concluded from a comparison to Figure 9 which shows that the steps vanish in the CDFs. The variances of the CDFs are decreased in comparison to Figure 9 because the probability tends to one that a best connection is found on which the highest number of bits is loaded on its allocated subcarriers."

                "In this paper, a novel algorithm for subcarrier, bit, and power allocation in a relay network is presented. Since the effort which is caused by bringing the short-term CSI to a central point within a cell is quite large, the algorithm coordinates the allocation of slots, subcarriers, power and bits between the BS and the RSs. The algorithm aims at maximizing the sum rate of a cell while each SSs is guaranteed a minimum data rate. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a superior sum rate compared to static resource allocation algorithms. Furthermore, the coordinated resource allocation algorithm enables to serve an increased number of SSs compared to static resource allocation algorithms. Simulation results show that a sum rate in a cell is achieved by low-complex algorithms, which is close to an upper bound for the sum rate within a scenario representing typical features of a cell in a relay network."
