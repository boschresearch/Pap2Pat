    "title": "Identification of Pro-MMP-7 as a Serum Marker for Renal Cell Carcinoma by Use of Proteomic Analysis",
    "date": "2008-03-01",
    "abstract": "Background: No validated renal cell carcinoma (RCC) marker is known for detection of asymptomatic disease in selected populations or for prognostic purposes or treatment monitoring. We identified immunogenic proteins as tumor markers for RCC by combining conventional proteome analysis with serological screening, and we investigated the diagnostic clinical value of such markers in serum. Methods: We studied the immunogenic protein expression profile of CAL 54, a human RCC cell line, by 2-dimensional electrophoresis combined with immunoblotting using sera from healthy donors compared with RCC patients. We developed a homogeneous, fluorescent, dual-monoclonal immunoassay for metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7) and used it to measure MMP-7 in sera from 30 healthy donors, 30 RCC patients, and 40 control patients. Results: Pro-MMP-7 (29 kDa; pI 7.7) in the CAL 54 cell line secretome was an immunogenic protein reactive with RCC patient sera but not with control sera. The concentrations of pro-MMP-7 were increased (P <0.0001) in sera of RCC patients (median 7.56 \u03bcg/L; range 3.12\u201330.5 \u03bcg/L) compared with healthy controls (median 2.13 \u03bcg/L; range 0.17\u20133.5 \u03bcg/L). Serum pro-MMP-7 had a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 78%\u201399%) at a specificity of 75% (59%\u201387%) for RCC in the samples tested. Conclusion: Proteomics technology combined with serology led to the identification of serum pro-MMP-7 as a marker of RCC and represents a powerful tool in searching for candidate proteins as biomarkers.",

                "A combination of 2DE expression profiling of tumor cell lines or tissues and immunoblotting with patient and control sera such as Proteomex or Spear might serve as a powerful tool for identification of tumorassociated antigens. Antigens eliciting a humoral response might be employed in cancer screening and diagnosis, in establishing a prognosis, or as novel therapeutic targets. So far, this experimental approach has been successfully implemented in lung carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and RCC (15,16,30,31 ). To seek for candidates as new circulating RCC markers, we explored an alternative approach based on the use of patient sera to probe 2DE Western blots of RCC cell line supernatant, rather than tumor cell lysates or tissues as in the Proteomex or Spear techniques. In this study, the results showed IgG immunoreactivity against 12 proteins secreted by the CAL54 cell line.",
                "Our experiments have produced two important findings. The first is that the presence of pro-MMP-7 as immunogenic protein in RCC cell line supernatant was confirmed by an approach combining secretome analysis with serological screening. This is the first demonstration of antibodies to pro-MMP-7 in cancer patients, although numerous circulating antitumor antibodies have been detected in cancer patient sera, with identified antigens such as Her2/neu (32 ), thymidine phosphorylase (16 ), and PGP9.5 (30 ). Furthermore, we detected 2 forms of MMP-7 in CAL 54 cell line supernatant: pro-MMP-7 and mature MMP-7, which is the result of activation of the proenzyme; however, our results demonstrated an IgG immunoreactivity only against the proenzyme. The IgG response spe-  cific to pro-MMP-7 might be associated with presence of N-terminal proregion neoepitope created in renal carcinoma cells and elicited T-cell stimulatory activity. For example, neoepitopes created by mutations in the human triosphosphate isomerase have been found in melanoma cells causing enhanced T-cell activity compared with the wild-type epitope (33 ).",
                "We have developed for the first time a homogeneous fluorescent immunoassay for MMP-7 by using 2 monoclonal antibodies (clones 01S and 29S) that recognize both active MMP-7 and pro-MMP-7 in RCC cell line supernatant by immunoblotting analysis. Thus the newly developed immunoassay can detect 2 forms of MMP-7. Zymogen MMP-7 in healthy and RCC human sera could be observed in qualitative Western blot analysis, but active MMP-7 was not detected in human serum, although antibodies recognizing 2 forms of MMP-7 were used. Ohuchi et al. (25 ) mentioned that pro-MMP-7 exists in human serum as polymers or complexed with serum proteins. Furthermore, the same group has reported undetectable levels of active MMP-7 in human normal serum using enzyme immunoassay for human active MMP-7 (34 ). Western blot data on healthy and RCC human sera therefore suggest that the level of active MMP-7 may be below the detection limit of our immunoblotting system (\u03fd0.7 g/L), or that pro-MMP-7 could be the sole form circulating in healthy and RCC human sera.",
                "Our second finding is raised MMP-7 concentrations in RCC patient sera using TRACE immunoassay. Recent data suggest a role for MMPs in a number of renal pathophysiologies (35 ). Many studies have shown that the overexpression of MMP-7 in several cancers is associated with advanced clinicopathological stages and unfavorable prognosis (21,36 ). Increased expression of MMP-7 has been observed in high-grade RCC tumors (24 ). Recently, Miyata et al. (37 ) mentioned that the MMP-7 status of RCC tissues was a strong predictor of poor prognosis. None of the studies described above have suggested that MMP-7 or pro-MMP-7 levels may be used as humoral markers for detection of RCC.",
                "Here we report raised MMP-7 concentrations in sera from patients with primary and metastasized RCC at stages I to IV. Because of small patient numbers, we could not show statistically significant correlation between serum MMP-7 levels and different stages of RCC patients. The potential association of serum MMP-7 with progression of RCC or tumor load requires further investigation using a larger sample.",
                "Certainly the presence of MMP-7 in serum is not specific to renal cancer; future studies including a larger sample should therefore aim to determine its serum concentration in patients with various tumors and benign renal diseases. Although we found MMP-7 in the serum of patients with some cancers or benign kidney tumors, the positivity was much lower than in RCC. Consequently the specificity of MMP-7 is limited, and this will restrict the use of MMP-7 for wide screening of the population.",
                "On the other hand, the high sensitivity for serum MMP-7 in RCC patients could allow the use of this marker for the following essential needs. The first is the routine screening of especially high-risk populations (Von Hippel-Lindau, hemodialysis, and transplanted or immunodepressed patients (38 )) and detection of asymptomatic tumors. In this setting, RCC is currently being detected either by CT scan as part of a screening policy or from symptoms reflecting advanced disease. Therefore, to improve survival, it makes sense to detect asymptomatic tumors, which have proven less aggressive than symptomatic counterparts (39 ). The second need is prognostication in RCC, which is important for counseling patients, adapting follow-up, and selecting patients for clinical trials. For example, a sensitive humoral RCC marker test would be valuable for detecting tumor recurrence in patients with RCC after total or partial nephrectomy. Such a marker will allow full evaluation of the spread of the disease. It may help to limit the use of invasive examination and to adapt therapeutics earlier. No biological prognostic parameter is currently recognized in clinical practice. Serum VEGF is an interesting candidate, but conflicting results have been obtained so far (40 ).",
                "Finally, in the era of new targeted therapies it is increasingly important to have reliable indicators for predicting drug response and for monitoring treatment. In summary, such a humoral marker will facilitate the monitoring of tumors during treatment and allow better prediction of therapeutic responses and prognosis.",
