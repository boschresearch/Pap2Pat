    "title": "Trapping mammalian protein complexes in viral particles",
    "date": "2016-04-28",
    "abstract": "Cell lysis is an inevitable step in classical mass spectrometry\u2013based strategies to analyse protein complexes. Complementary lysis conditions, in situ cross-linking strategies and proximal labelling techniques are currently used to reduce lysis effects on the protein complex. We have developed Virotrap, a viral particle sorting approach that obviates the need for cell homogenization and preserves the protein complexes during purification. By fusing a bait protein to the HIV-1 GAG protein, we show that interaction partners become trapped within virus-like particles (VLPs) that bud from mammalian cells. Using an efficient VLP enrichment protocol, Virotrap allows the detection of known binary interactions and MS-based identification of novel protein partners as well. In addition, we show the identification of stimulus-dependent interactions and demonstrate trapping of protein partners for small molecules. Virotrap constitutes an elegant complementary approach to the arsenal of methods to study protein complexes.",

                        "Classical AP\u2013MS approaches rely on cell homogenization to access protein complexes, a step that can vary significantly with the lysis conditions (detergents, salt concentrations, pH conditions and so on)5. To eliminate the homogenization step in AP\u2013MS, we reasoned that incorporation of a protein complex inside a secreted VLP traps the interaction partners under native conditions and protects them during further purification. We thus explored the possibility of protein complex packaging by the expression of GAG-bait protein chimeras (Fig. 1) as expression of GAG results in the release of VLPs from the cells910. As a first PPI pair to evaluate this concept, we selected the HRAS protein as a bait combined with the RAF1 prey protein. We were able to specifically detect the HRAS\u2013RAF1 interaction following enrichment of VLPs via ultracentrifugation (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To prevent tedious ultracentrifugation steps, we designed a novel single-step protocol wherein we co-express the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) together with a tagged version of this glycoprotein in addition to the GAG bait and prey. Both tagged and untagged VSV-G proteins are probably presented as trimers on the surface of the VLPs, allowing efficient antibody-based recovery from large volumes. The HRAS\u2013RAF1 interaction was confirmed using this single-step protocol (Supplementary Fig. 1b). No associations with unrelated bait or prey proteins were observed for both protocols."

                        "We next explored the reciprocal detection of a set of PPI pairs, which were selected based on published evidence and cytosolic localization15. After single-step purification and western blot analysis, we could readily detect reciprocal interactions between CDK2 and CKS1B, LCP2 and GRAP2, and S100A1 and S100B (Fig. 2a). Only for the LCP2 prey we observed nonspecific association with an irrelevant bait construct. However, the particle levels of the GRAP2 bait were substantially lower as compared with those of the GAG control construct (GAG protein levels in VLPs; Fig. 2a, second panel of the LCP2 prey). After quantification of the intensities of bait and prey proteins and normalization of prey levels using bait levels, we observed a strong enrichment for the GAG-GRAP2 bait (Supplementary Fig. 2).",
                        "To compare Virotrap with other technologies, we performed a binary analysis of the human positive reference set (hsPRS-v1, 92 PPI pairs) and the corresponding random reference set (hsRRS-v1, 92 randomly selected pairs). Both sets contain proteins from all cellular compartments to remove any bias in protein localization. In this western blotting screen, all 184 baits and 184 preys were expressed in combinations as published by Braun et al.15. After expression, purification and western blot analysis, we were able to detect 28 (30%) interactions in the PRS, whereas 5 (5%) interactions were detected in the RRS (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Western blot analysis of the lysates of the producer cells showed that \u223c30% of the bait proteins (56 out of 184) and 40% of the prey proteins (E-tag, 25 out of 41) were not expressed at a detectable level, indicating a large underestimation of detectable interactions (Supplementary Data 1). Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the overlap between Virotrap and data obtained with other PPI methods for the PRS as published by Braun et al.15, underscoring the notion that Virotrap detects known interactions and further confirms additional PPIs from the PRS, complementary to the other approaches.",
                        "To further evaluate the sensitivity of Virotrap, we assessed the interaction between two signalling molecules in Toll-like receptor signalling: myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) and MAL (TIRAP), which bind via their Toll/interleukin1 receptor (TIR) homology domains16 (Kd=8\u2009\u03bcM (ref. 17)). A panel of MYC-tagged MAL mutant prey proteins with reduced binding affinities18 was tested against the MYD88 TIR domain as bait. Figure 2b shows western blotting results for prey presence in the particles. These binary Virotrap experiments generally show the same trend as the data obtained with the mammalian PPI trap (MAPPIT) assay18(Supplementary Fig. 4), a mammalian two-hybrid method for which the readout reflects the affinity between protein partners19. In addition, these data illustrate that Virotrap enables the detection of weak PPIs."

                        "For the detection of novel interaction partners, we scaled up VLP production and purification protocols (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 1 for an overview of the protocol) and investigated protein partners trapped using the following bait proteins: Fas-associated via death domain (FADD), A20 (TNFAIP3), nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) essential modifier (IKBKG), TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK), MYD88 and ring finger protein 41 (RNF41). To obtain specific interactors from the lists of identified proteins, we challenged the data with a combined protein list of 19 unrelated Virotrap experiments (Supplementary Table 1 for an overview). Figure 3 shows the design and the list of candidate interactors obtained after removal of all proteins that were found in the 19 control samples (including removal of proteins from the control list identified with a single peptide). The remaining list of confident protein identifications (identified with at least two peptides in at least two biological repeats) reveals both known and novel candidate interaction partners. All candidate interactors including single peptide protein identifications are given in Supplementary Data 2 and also include recurrent protein identifications of known interactors based on a single peptide; for example, CASP8 for FADD and TANK for NEMO. Using alternative methods, we confirmed the interaction between A20 and FADD, and the associations with transmembrane proteins (insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 1) that were captured using RNF41 as a bait (Supplementary Fig. 6). To address the use of Virotrap for the detection of dynamic interactions, we activated the NF-\u03baB pathway via the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFRSF1A) using TNF\u03b1 (TNF) and performed Virotrap analysis using A20 as bait (Fig. 3). This resulted in the additional enrichment of receptor-interacting kinase (RIPK1), TNFR1-associated via death domain (TRADD), TNFRSF1A and TNF itself, confirming the expected activated complex20.",
                        "Further, Virotrap was compared side-by-side with classical AP\u2013MS experiments using A20 and RNF41 as baits. Both overlapping and unique prey proteins were identified for these bait proteins (Supplementary Fig. 7). Taken together, when compared with classical AP\u2013MS, Virotrap provides a complementary view on bait interactomes.",
                        "We additionally explored the use of Virotrap for the detection of protein interactions with small molecules. To this end, we fused the Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase protein (eDHFR) as a bait to GAG and treated the particle-producing cells with bivalent molecules consisting of methotrexate (MTX) linked via a polyethylene glycol linker to a small molecule of interest (Fig. 4a). In this study, we used simvastatin, tamoxifen and reversine as small molecule baits (Fig. 4b (ref. 21)). Data analysis was performed by elimination of all proteins previously identified in the 19 control experiments (as before) combined with the protein identifications from 4 additional eDHFR bait experiments treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). This resulted in the consistent enrichment of the known targets for simvastatin (HMG-CoA reductase enzyme (HMGCR)) and reversine (Aurora kinase A (AURKA)). The novel interactions of tamoxifen with HSDB17B4, and reversine with NQO2 were confirmed using an orthogonal MASPIT assay22 (Supplementary Fig. 8).",
                        "An important issue in AP\u2013MS is defining the actual set of background, nonspecific interactors2324. Analysis of 19 Virotrap control samples reveals a high recurrence of \u223c174 proteins (identified in at least 15/19 samples) (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 9). Structural proteins (for example, ACTB and EZR), serum proteins (for example, A2M and albumin) and proteins related to HIV biology (GAG and its host interaction partners such as Cyclophilin/PPIA and ALIX/PDCD6IP) are found as highly recurrent background proteins. Further, the distribution of the abundance of these background proteins is similar for Virotrap and AP\u2013MS, although there is a high recurrence in the background of known low abundant proteins, which is likely to be due to the unique biology underlying Virotrap (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Lysis conditions used in AP\u2013MS strategies are critical for the preservation of protein complexes. A multitude of lysis conditions have been described, culminating in a recent report where protein complex stability was assessed under 96 lysis/purification protocols5. Moreover, the authors suggest to optimize the conditions for every complex, implying an important workload for researchers embarking on protein complex analysis using classical AP\u2013MS. As lysis results in a profound change of the subcellular context and significantly alters the concentration of proteins, loss of complex integrity during a classical AP\u2013MS protocol can be expected. A clear evolution towards \u2018lysis-independent' approaches in the co-complex analysis field is evident with the introduction of BioID6 and APEX25 where proximal proteins, including proteins residing in the complex, are labelled with biotin by an enzymatic activity fused to a bait protein. A side-by-side comparison between classical AP\u2013MS and BioID showed overlapping and unique candidate binding proteins for both approaches78, supporting the notion that complementary methods are needed to provide a comprehensive view on protein complexes. This has also been clearly demonstrated for binary approaches15 and is a logical consequence of the heterogenic nature underlying PPIs (binding mechanism, requirement for posttranslational modifications, location, affinity and so on).",
                "In this report, we explore an alternative, yet complementary method to isolate protein complexes without interfering with cellular integrity. By trapping protein complexes in the protective environment of a virus-like shell, the intact complexes are preserved during the purification process. This constitutes a new concept in co-complex analysis wherein complex stability is physically guaranteed by a protective, physical structure. A comparison of our Virotrap approach with AP\u2013MS shows complementary data, with specific false positives and false negatives for both methods (Supplementary Fig. 7).",
                "The current implementation of the Virotrap platform implies the use of a GAG-bait construct resulting in considerable expression of the bait protein. Different strategies are currently pursued to reduce bait expression including co-expression of a native GAG protein together with the GAG-bait protein, not only reducing bait expression but also creating more \u2018space' in the particles potentially accommodating larger bait protein complexes. Nevertheless, the presence of the bait on the forming GAG scaffold creates an intracellular affinity matrix (comparable to the early in vitro affinity columns for purification of interaction partners from lysates26) that has the potential to compete with endogenous complexes by avidity effects. This avidity effect is a powerful mechanism that aids in the recruitment of cyclophilin to GAG27, a well-known weak interaction (Kd=16\u2009\u03bcM (ref. 28)) detectable as a background association in the Virotrap system. Although background binding may be increased by elevated bait expression, weaker associations are readily detectable (for example, MAL\u2014MYD88-binding study; Fig. 2c).",
                "The size of Virotrap particles (around 145\u2009nm) suggests limitations in the size of the protein complex that can be accommodated in the particles. Further experimentation is required to define the maximum size of proteins or the number of protein complexes that can be trapped inside the particles.",
                "The underlying biology of the system makes it best suited for the study of cytosolic complexes. However, we could identify prey proteins residing in the plasma membrane compartment or in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The current version of the platform is probably not applicable to mitochondria, peroxisomes or other confined cellular compartments. The introduction of alternative or artificial viral matrix variants combined with adapted purification protocols will open the way to protein complex trapping in other compartments of the cell. The activity of antiviral factors (for example, tetherin29) may interfere with Virotrap in other cell types. Via genome engineering approaches, these factors can be eliminated. The use of artificial or mutated GAG variants can also prevent the activity of antiviral mechanisms and may thus facilitate the introduction of the system in other cell lines and primary cells.",
                "It is still highly challenging to find protein interaction partners for small molecules, not only for clarifying the mechanism of action of orphan drugs but also for identification of the proteins responsible for the off-target effects of known drugs. Besides the classical pull-down approach using biotinylated variants of the small molecules, some technologies were specifically developed for this purpose including MAPPIT variants2230 and the more recent thermal profiling strategy coupled to proteomics31. Using a bivalent small molecule as a bait we here show successful capture of the well-known simvastatin target HMGCR, a transmembrane ER-resident protein. UBIAD1 (ref. 32) is probably a member of the HMGCR complex that is co-sorted to the particles. A physical interaction between HMGCR and SQLE has not been formally shown, but the specific identification by Virotrap of this second rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol pathway may point to a beneficial off-target effect of simvastatin.",
                "In this study we employ a stringent filtering approach to reveal specific protein partner candidates based on the elimination of all proteins identified in a large number of control experiments (19 controls for standard discovery+4 additional DMSO experiments for the small molecule application). A number of filtering approaches have been described24 and the careful application of some of these tools may provide a useful alternative for the current \u2018black list' strategy. For example, application of the bait-centred tool SFINX33 using AURKA as artificial bait for the reversine study revealed association with TTK (SFINX P value of 1.79E\u221243), a well-known target of this small molecule34. However, TTK is removed in the black list strategy, because of sporadic identification in control experiments.",
                "In conclusion, Virotrap captures significant parts of known interactomes and reveals new interactions. This cell lysis-free approach purifies protein complexes under native conditions and thus provides a powerful method to complement AP\u2013MS or other PPI data. Future improvements of the system include strategies to reduce bait expression to more physiological levels and application of advanced data analysis options to filter out background. These developments can further aid in the deployment of Virotrap as a powerful extension of the current co-complex technology arsenal."

False discovery rates (FDR) were obtained by searches against the reversed version of the complete search database and by retaining only the peptide to spectra matches (PSMs) with the highest score in standard or reverse search. The false discovery rate was then calculated by dividing the number of PSMs against the reversed database by the number of PSMs against both databases.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 5\u2009\u03bcM ZnCl2, phosphatase inhibitors and protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; Roche)). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 10\u2009\u03bcl MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads preloaded with 1\u2009\u03bcg ANTI-FLAG BioM2-Biotin antibody. Control immunoprecipitations were performed without ANTI-FLAG antibody. The material was directly eluted using SDS\u2013PAGE loading buffer, boiled and loaded on SDS\u2013PAGE. MAPPIT experiments were performed as described before36. The binary MASPIT assays were essentially performed as described before21. Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded in black, tissue-culture-treated 96-well plates at 10,000 cells per well in 100\u2009\u03bcl culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS) and grown at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 8% CO2. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with a combination of the pCLG-eDHFR bait plasmid21, the pMG1-HSD17B4 prey construct and the pXP2d2-rPAP1-luciferase reporter22. The prey constructs were generated by Gateway transfer of the full-size AURKA, ESR1, HSD17B4 and NQO2 open reading frames, obtained as an entry clone in the hORFeome collection, into the Gateway compatible pMG1 prey destination vector40. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were either left unstimulated or treated with 100\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 leptin, with addition of DMSO, MTX-modified tamoxifen or MTX-modified Reversine. Another 24\u2009h later, luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega)."
