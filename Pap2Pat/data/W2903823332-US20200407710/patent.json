                        "Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression is achieved by the interplay between non-coding regulatory elements, including distal enhancers and proximal promoters, and the transcriptional regulators they help recruit or repel, thus modulating the expression of nearby genes. Unlike protein-coding genes, which can be readily identified by their sequence properties and evolutionary signatures, gene-regulatory elements lack highly-predictive sequence patterns and show only modest evolutionary conservation at the nucleotide level. Thus, systematic recognition of gene-regulatory elements has relied on mapping of their epigenomic signatures, including DNA accessibility, histone modifications, and DNA methylation. For example, both enhancers and promoters have high DNA accessibility and low H3K27me3, but distal enhancers show relatively higher H3K27ac and H3K4me1 while promoters show relatively higher H3K9ac and H3K4me3. However, many regions showing such epigenomic marks do not experimentally drive reporter gene expression, and some regions driving gene expression lack endogenous signatures. Moreover, epigenomic signatures are often low-resolution, with important driver regulatory nucleotides comprising only a small subset of the larger regions showing epigenomic signatures.",
                        "Experimental dissection of enhancer and promoter regions has been traditionally expensive, laborious, low throughput, and low-resolution, lacking the resolution to pinpoint individual regulatory driver nucleotides without recourse to extensive mutagenesis. Several high-throughput reporter assays for enhancer function have recently been developed, enabling the testing of tens of thousands of distinct DNA sequences simultaneously, including MPRA and CRE-Seq. These assays entail microarray-based oligonucleotide synthesis technology to generate the tested elements and their barcodes, cloning the oligonucleotides into a common episomal reporter vector, and using high-throughput sequencing to quantify expression. Technical limitations of oligonucleotide synthesis currently restrict the maximum tested DNA fragment length to 230 nucleotides, and the maximum number of tested constructs to 240,000 sequences per array. Although still limited in the number of target regions, Sharpr-MPRA enabled higher-resolution inferences by densely tiling target regions with multiple overlapping constructs, and exploiting subtle differences between the measured activity of neighboring constructs to achieve offset resolution (\u02dc5 bp) instead of construct resolution (\u02dc230 bp). STARR-Seq integrated random genomic fragments downstream of the transcription start site of episomal reporter genes, thus foregoing the oligo synthesis step and the need for barcodes as the tested elements were transcribed and serve as their own activity reporters. However, STARR-seq fragments are selected by random genomic fragmentation. As random genomic fragmentation does not densely cover regulatory elements, STARR-seq has limited efficiency and resolution at regulatory regions.",

                        "Here, Applicants present a new method, HiDRA (High-resolution Dissection of Regulatory Activity, also known as High-Definition Reporter Assay), that overcomes prior limitations by combining components of Sharpr-MPRA and STARR-Seq with genome-wide selection of accessible regions from ATAC-Seq (e.g. \u201cATAC-STARR-seq\u201d). Applicants used HiDRA to test 7 million DNA fragments preferentially selected from accessible chromatin in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line. By design, accessibility selected fragments were highly overlapping (up to 370 per region), enabling the pinpointing of driver regulatory nucleotides by exploiting subtle differences in reporter activity between partially-overlapping fragments, using a new machine learning model SHARPR2 (also known as SHARPR-RE (SHARPR-Random Endpoints)). The resulting maps included 65,000 regions showing significant enhancer function and were enriched for endogenous active histone marks (including H3K9ac, H3K27ac), regulatory sequence motifs, and regions bound by immune regulators. Within them, Applicants discovered 13,000 high-resolution driver elements enriched for regulatory motifs and evolutionarily-conserved nucleotides. Additionally, the maps could predict causal genetic variants underlying disease from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).",

The methods may comprise extracting accessible DNA regions from ATAC-Seq, size-selecting for constructs between about 150 and about 500 nt long, and inserting the selected constructs downstream of an episomal reporter gene to test their activity and exploit their overlapping nature for high-resolution inferences. The approach overcomes the construct-length and region count limitations of synthesis-based technologies, and the ATAC-seq selection of open chromatin regions concentrates the signal on likely regulatory regions and enables high-resolution inferences. Altogether, enhancer constructs of comparable length to low-throughput studies may be tested, achieving high resolution dissection of systematic perturbation. In some embodiments, the methods allow for testing millions of unique fragments in a single experiment.",

These fragments may be enriched for endogenous active histone marks (including H3K9ac, H3K27ac), regulatory sequence motifs, and regions bound by immune regulators. The ATAC-based selection approach may result in highly-overlapping fragments, with up to 370 fragments per region, enabling pinpointing driver regulatory nucleotides. Overall, HiDRA may provide a general, scalable, high-throughput, high-resolution (\u02dc50 nucleotides) approach for experimental dissection of regulatory regions and driver nucleotides in the context of human biology and disease.",

In some embodiments, the end joined DNA that includes a labeled nucleotide is captured with a specific binding agent that specifically binds a capture moiety, such as biotin, on the labeled nucleotide. In some embodiments, the capture moiety is adsorbed or otherwise captured on a surface. In specific embodiments, the end target joined DNA is labeled with biotin, for instance by incorporation of biotin-14-CTP or other biotinylated nucleotide during the filling in of the 5\u2032 overhang, for example with a DNA polymerase, allowing capture by streptavidin. Other means for labeling, capturing, and detecting nucleic acid probes include: incorporation of aminoallyl-labeled nucleotides, incorporation of sulfhydryl-labeled nucleotides, incorporation of allyl- or azide-containing nucleotides, and many other methods described in Bioconjugate Techniques (2nd Ed), Greg T. Hermanson, Elsevier (2008), which is specifically incorporated herein by reference.

The nature of the carrier can be either soluble to some extent or insoluble for the purposes of the present disclosure. The support material may have virtually any possible structural configuration so long as the coupled molecule is capable of binding to targeting probe. Thus, the support configuration may be spherical, as in a bead, or cylindrical, as in the inside surface of a test tube, or the external surface of a rod. Alternatively, the surface may be flat such as a sheet or test strip. After capture, the end joined nucleic acid fragments are available for amplification (e.g., PCR), wherein the amplified products include universal ends for use in cloning into the regulatory element assay vector described herein.",

Contact domains as used herein refer to contiguous genomic intervals in which there is an enhanced probability of contact among all loci. Contact domains range in size from tens of kilo bases to several megabases, with a median size of 185 kb. Many contact domains are also \u201cloop domains\u201d\u2014that is, contact domains whose boundaries are demarcated by the endpoints of a chromatin loop. Chromatin fibers are arranged in living cells as independent chromatin loops anchored to the nuclear matrix or chromosomal scaffold. Specific DNA sequences act as anchors for these loops. Genes are configured into looped structures or chromatin loops that juxtapose regulatory elements to activate or repress transcription. Moreover, chromatin loop formation is the result of the presence of a pair of CTCF binding motifs in the convergent orientation on opposite strands of the DNA. Not being bound by a theory contact domains are enriched for regulatory sequences as compared to the entire genome.",

Error prone PCR is a method by which random mutants maybe inserted into any piece of DNA. The technique is based on PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Normally the replication of DNA by the polymerase is extremely specific. The difference in error prone PCR is that the fidelity of the Taq DNA polymerase is modulated by alteration of the composition of the reaction buffer. In these conditions, the polymerase makes mistakes in the base paring during DNA synthesis that results in the introduction of errors in the newly synthesized complementary DNA strand. By carefully controlling the buffer composition the frequency of mis-incorporation of nucleotide bases, and therefore the number of errors introduced into the sequence may be regulated. For the technique to work properly, a Taq DNA polymerase which does not have proof-reading ability may be used. This proof-reading, or auto-correction of nucleotide sequence, is a property that is found in many commercially available Taq DNA polymerases. Use of a proof-reading DNA polymerase in an error prone PCR reaction may result in the automatic correction of the mismatched nucleotides, and any mutations introduced during the reaction may be lost.",

Generally, a vector may be capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements. In general, the term \u201cvector\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g. circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a \u201cplasmid,\u201d which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques.",

For example, such vectors may have virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g. retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. The viral vectors may be non-integrating vectors. For example, certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). The viral vectors may be integrating viral vectors. For examples, Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. In certain examples, a vector may be a lentiviral vector (e.g., an integrating or non-integrating lentiviral vector). Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \u201cexpression vectors.\u201d In certain embodiments, the methods utilize episomal vectors.",

Depth can be calculated from the length of the original genome (G), the number of reads (N), and the average read length (L) as N\u00d7L/G. For example, a hypothetical genome with 2,000 base pairs reconstructed from 8 reads with an average length of 500 nucleotides will have 2\u00d7 redundancy. This parameter also enables one to estimate other quantities, such as the percentage of the genome covered by reads (sometimes also called coverage). A high coverage in shotgun sequencing is desired because it can overcome errors in base calling and assembly. The subject of DNA sequencing theory addresses the relationships of such quantities. Even though the sequencing accuracy for each individual nucleotide is very high, the very large number of nucleotides in the genome means that if an individual genome is only sequenced once, there will be a significant number of sequencing errors. Furthermore rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common.

Fragments are enriched from open chromatin and regulatory regions using ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing) and subsequently cloned into the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of a reporter gene on the self-transcribing enhancer reporter vector used in STARR-seq3,4. Fragments with transcriptional regulatory activity promote self-transcription such that active segments of DNA can be identified and quantified by high-throughput RNA sequencing to produce a quantitative readout of enhancer activity (FIG. 1A). Library construction can be completed in 2-3 days and requires as few as 104-105 cells as input starting material.",

More than 99% of fragments had lengths between 169 nt and 477nt (median: 337nt), with the fragment length distribution showing two peaks spaced by \u02dc147 nt, corresponding to the length of DNA wrapped around each nucleosome (FIG. 1). In contrast to unbiased fragmentation of the genome, the library has much higher efficiency for selectively targeting accessible DNA regions that are more likely to play gene-regulatory roles. The HiDRA library covers 4486 predicted enhancers and 9631 predicted promoters (\u201cActive Transcription Start Site (TSS)\u201d state) with more than 10 unique fragments (FIG. 1C, colored lines), a \u02dc130-fold and \u02dc210-fold enrichment compared to 35 enhancer and 46 promoter regions expected to be covered by chance at the same coverage, indicating that HiDRA library construction successfully targets predicted regulatory regions. Even among enhancer and promoter regions, those with higher expected activity are preferentially selected by HiDRA, as they show higher accessibility and are thus more likely to be cloned in our library and tested by our episomal reporters (FIG. 8).",
                                "The cloning strategy is specifically designed to densely sample regulatory regions, in order to enable high resolution inference of regulatory activity from highly-overlapping fragments.

In addition to clustering of tested fragments within the same region, high-resolution inference relies on partially-overlapping rather than fully-overlapping fragments, which requires a random fragmentation pattern. Indeed, the Tn5 transposase Applicants used here inserts randomly into the genome, and indeed the resulting DNA fragments provide a dense sampling of start and end positions that mirrors the peaks of ATAC-seq experiments (FIG. 1D), indicating that accessible regions most likely to show regulatory activity will have both higher representation in our libraries, and also more starting and ending positions that can help identify driver nucleotides."

To quantify the regulatory activity of tested elements, Applicants compared the number of RNA reads obtained for a fragment (corresponding to the expression level of the reporter gene, as the constructs are self-transcribing), relative to representation of that fragment in the non-transfected input plasmid library (thus normalizing the differential abundance of each fragment in our library).

This chromatin state is defined by the presence of both promoter and enhancer histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac, and was named \u201cTSS Flanking\u201d due its depletion at exactly the TSS position, but its enrichment 400nt-1 kb upstream of annotated transcription start sites9.

Surprisingly, this enrichment stayed constant thereafter for promoter regions, and increased modestly for enhancer regions, ultimately surpassing the enrichment seen for promoters. In fact, even though promoter chromatin states were more enriched at intermediate HiDRA activity levels, enhancer chromatin states were the most enriched at the highest HiDRA activity levels (p=9.3\u00d710\u2212102, FIG. 10A), suggesting that enhancer elements have a greater dynamic range of regulatory activity potential, which has implications for the regulatory architecture of genes.",

The ZNF/repeats-associated chromatin state (marked by H3K36me3 and H3K9me3) showed a modest enrichment for lower HiDRA activity levels, but continued to increase linearly even at the highest activity levels, possibly due to active repetitive elements, as Applicants discuss below.",

Applicants calculated the overrepresentation of 651 transcription factor sequence motifs assembled by ENCODE in active HiDRA regions, and found enrichment for many distinct motifs for immune transcription factors (FIG. 10B), including IRF, NFKB1, and RELA, corresponding to transcriptional regulators known to function in GM12878 compared to other human cell lines. The motifs enriched in promoter chromatin states were largely distinct from those enriched in enhancer chromatin states, highlighting the differential regulatory control of the two types of regions (FIG. 10A).

For example, a recent study identified subclasses of active enhancer elements marked with H3K122ac or H3K64ac but not H3K27ac14. While these marks were not profiled in GM12878, inactive chromatin states that showed HiDRA activity were 8-fold to 13-fold more likely to be bound by transcription factors in ChIP-seq experiments in GM12878 than inactive chromatin states that lacked HiDRA activity (FIG. 4B), indicating that the assays can successfully recover active regions even outside active chromatin states, and highlighting the importance of the unbiased survey of open chromatin regions regardless of their endogenous chromatin marks.",

                                "In addition to the presence of regulatory motifs for known regulators active in GM12878, Applicants sought additional driver elements that may be responsible for the episomal activity of endogenously-inactive regions. In particular, Applicants considered the presence of Long-Terminal-Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, which have been previously shown to have regulatory activity potential and were enriched in the set of all active HiDRA regions unlike other repetitive elements in the genome (FIG. 12)2,20. Indeed, Applicants found that active HiDRA regions from endogenously-inactive regions showed substantial enrichment for LTR retrotransposons. In fact, Quiescent and Heterochromatin states were more enriched for LTR retrotransposons than either Enhancer or Promoter chromatin states (FIG. 4E, FIG. 12). As LTRs are motif-rich and often act as the substrate for recently evolved enhancers, these endogenously inactive but episomally-active HiDRA regions may represent a reservoir for the emergence of new regulatory elements6."

As an example, Applicants considered a 3 kb region on chromosome 7 that is covered by 134 distinct HiDRA fragments. When Applicants examined every fragment in this region, Applicants observed that fragments overlapping the known RUNX3 motif showed substantially higher regulatory activity (FIG. 5A). This motif is bound by the RUNX3 protein in GM12878 cells and shows increased evolutionary conservation (FIG. 5A). These properties suggest that the driver regulatory nucleotides within this region are tightly concentrated surrounding the RUNX3 motif, and that on the global level the differential activity of HiDRA-tested segments should enable us to systematically discover these driver nucleotides in an unbiased way based on the relative activity of fragments that do or do not overlap them.",
                                "As part of the development of Sharpr-MPRA2, Applicants had previously developed the SHARPR algorithm, a graphical probabilistic model that inferred high-resolution activity from MPRA tiling experiments by reasoning about the differential activity of partially-overlapping microarray spots. Intuitively, SHARPR allowed us to transform measurements from the 145-bp resolution of individually tested tiles to the 5-bp resolution of the offset between consecutive tiles. The SHARPR algorithm relies on synthesized oligos that uniformly tile regions at regularly spaced intervals, and thus is not applicable for the random fragmentation nature of HiDRA experiments where both the length and the spacing of neighboring fragments can vary. To address this challenge, Applicants developed a new algorithm, SHARPR2, which estimates regulatory scores underlying any set of randomly-positioned and variable-length segments, by appropriately scaling the segments by their varying lengths, and enabling inferences at variable-length offsets between them (Appendix A).",
                                "Applying the SHARPR2 algorithm to the RUNX3 example above, Applicants found that the 3 kb region was narrowed down to a single \u2018driver\u2019 element of 27nt (FIG. 5A).

With increasing coverage, the resolution of driver regions also increased, from \u02dc50nt for regions with 10-20 fragments to \u02dc20nt for regions with 40 or more fragments (FIG. 13). The length of driver elements did not further decrease between 40 and 80 fragments per tiled region, suggesting a minimum number of \u02dc18 driver nucleotides necessary to drive regulatory activity. Similar to active HiDRA regions, driver elements were also mostly distal from annotated TSS regions, and were preferentially found in endogenously active chromatin states (active promoters, TSS-flanking, and active enhancer regions, FIGS. 14A-14B).",

The enriched motifs consisted of regulators known to be active in GM12878, including several critical B-cell and immune transcription factor including NF-kB and the IRF family (FIG. 5C). A total of 98 motifs were enriched in driver elements (FDR<0.05), clustering into several distinct groups with little overlap between groups, suggesting a wide range of distinct transcription factors act to regulate GM12878 gene expression (FIG. 5D). Applicants also found that driver nucleotides are significantly more likely to be evolutionarily-conserved across vertebrates than randomly-shuffled controls (FIG. 5E), with \u02dc1080 driver elements overlapping conserved regions, compared to only \u02dc650 expected by chance (p=2.23\u00d710\u221273).

Applicants studied the overlap between genetic variants associated with immune disorders and our high resolution predicted driver nucleotides. Even though driver nucleotides only cover 0.032% of the genome, Applicants found 12 cases where they overlap fine-mapped SNPs associated with 21 immune-related traits21 predicted to be causal (\u02dc5 expected by chance inside tiled regions, p=0.012, FIG. 6A). For example, Applicants predict a 76-nt driver element overlapping rs12946510 in the IKZF3 locus associated with multiple sclerosis in a tiled region of 3 kb (FIG. 6B), suggesting this may be the causal variant. The SNP overlaps a 76-nt driver element that contains a RUNX3 motif and a RELA motif, both bound by the respective TFs in GM128789. Indeed, rs12946510 is predicted to be causal based on genetic fine-mapping21, with a posterior probability of 0.314 of being causal with the next strongest signal showing only 0.067 posterior probability. rs12946510 is also an eQTL for the IKZF3 gene21,22, and was recently shown to disrupt enhancer activity for the surrounding 279-nt region using a luciferase reporter assay23, consistent with the prediction that rs12946510 is a causal SNP.",
                                "To recognize regions that showed differential activity between risk and non-risk alleles of common genetic variants, Applicants first inferred the genotype of all RNA fragments profiled. As HiDRA is a sequencing-based assay, where the expression of reporter genes is quantified based on the number of sequencing reads, allele-specific differences in HiDRA activity between risk and non-risk haplotypes should be detectable in principle by using heterozygous positions to distinguish reads coming from the 275 paternal or the maternal allele. In practice however, HiDRA fragments are much longer (\u02dc337 median length) than the typical sequencing reads Applicants used for quantification (37nt, paired end), and thus 78% of genetic variants will not be covered by the sequencing reads (if they fall in the inner \u02dc260nt not captured by our paired-end sequencing). To overcome this limitation and to determine allele-specific activity scores for all of the fragments, Applicants used low-depth re-sequencing of the input library using long reads, thus revealing the genotype associated with each start/end position in our library (FIG. 7A). Applicants augmented this information with 4-nt random i7 barcodes that were added by PCR during the initial HiDRA library construction, thus ensuring that the [start, end, i7] triplet is almost guaranteed to be unique, by resolving the cases where both start and end positions are identical between paternal and maternal alleles. This strategy enabled Applicants to resolve the genotype of all previously quantified HiDRA fragments without having to sequence both the plasmid and RNA libraries to full length at high depth, which would be too costly.",
                                "In a proof-of-concept analysis to assess the ability of HiDRA to detect allelic activity, Applicants applied this approach systematically to all heterozygous positions known in the genotyped GM12878 cell lines. Applicants found \u02dc180,000 heterozygous SNPs that were represented by at least one HiDRA fragment at either allele in our library. Applicants realized that fragments carrying the maternal or paternal alleles of a SNP may also differ at their start and end positions, and that differences at fragment ends may cause SNPs with no true biological activity to falsely appear to disrupt HiDRA activity (FIG. 15). Applicants attempted to filter out these cases by only comparing fragments that show 90% mutual overlap, and where the start and end of the fragment is more than 25nt from a high-resolution driver element, thus ensuring that allelic differences are not due to differential inclusion of driver elements (\u02dc16,000 SNPs remained after filtering). At an uncorrected nominal p-value cut-off of 0.05, Applicants found 880 \u2018allelic\u2019 HiDRA SNPs where paternal and maternal alleles showed differences in activity, 25 of which had a corrected FDR<0.1 (beta-binomial model24). The corresponding SNPs in these 880 allelic HiDRA regions were more frequently found in HiDRA active regions and more frequently predicted to have strong regulatory effects in open chromatin regions by an independent study25 (FIGS. 7B, 7C), suggesting they are biologically meaningful.",

The risk allele shows increased regulatory activity upstream of a HiDRA-annotated active region (nominal p=8.7\u00d710\u22124, FDR=0.25, FIGS. 7D, 7E). In a panel of human individuals from the GTEx project26, rs2382817 was an eQTL for TMBIM1 in EBV-transformed lymphocytes (the same cell type as GM12878, FIG. 7F), and for TMBIM1 and other nearby genes PNKD, ARPC2 and GPBAR1 in other tissues, consistent with a role of rs2382817 in gene expression regulation, and illustrating the possibility of using HiDRA to detect SNPs with allelic effects on regulatory activity.",

Applicants found that the endogenous loci of up-regulated HiDRA fragments are significantly more likely to be classified as promoter and enhancer elements, contain motifs for immune transcription factors and be marked by activating histone modifications. Applicants also leverage the dense tiling of HiDRA fragments at regulatory regions to perform a high-resolution mapping of regulatory activity to identify short DNA segments that act as drivers of regulatory activity, including one 76nt driver element that overlaps a SNP, rs12946510, associated with multiple sclerosis risk.",

For cell lines with poor transfection efficiencies, a non-integrating lentiviral infection method can be used instead of transfection, as both approaches have shown highly similar results in other high-throughput reporter assays27. HiDRA libraries can also be transfected in a different cell line than was used for library generation. For example, libraries could be generated from limited patient tissue, and subsequently transfected into a relevant immortalized cell line.",

Moving forward, construction of libraries with higher coverage at relevant SNPs should mitigate this concern. HiDRA also relies on the presence of different alleles in the input genomic DNA. While no human individual or cell line exists that is heterozygous at every clinically important genetic variant, future studies can pool cells or tissue from multiple individuals to generate a HiDRA library heterozygous at more loci. As recent studies have also shown that cancer driver mutations are enriched inside promoter elements, HiDRA may also be applied to pools of tumor samples to identify promoter variants that experimentally alter regulatory activity and gene expression28.",

HiDRA fragment libraries can be modified to introduce non-existing mutations through error-prone PCR or introduction of mutagens during fragment amplification. Another improvement to the assay is to further enrich for fragments from active regulatory regions, by coupling with a fragment capture technology similar to those used in Capture Hi-C to selectively test a subset of enhancers or promoters at higher resolution while retaining the advantages of having larger fragment sizes and high library complexity30. Finally, the SHARPR2 high-resolution mapping algorithm can be applied to other STARR-seq experiments. For example, investigators interested in only a specific locus could perform STARR-seq on a bacterial artificial chromosome clone (\u201cBAC-STARR-seq\u201d) that contains the region of interest3. SHARPR2 high-resolution mapping will then readily be capable of mapping regulatory activity of this specific locus with single nucleotide resolution.",

                                "Applicants performed 16 ATAC-seq reactions on 50,000 GM12878 cells each using a modified protocol based upon Buenrostro et al. (Supplemental Note 1). Applicants performed cell collection, lysis, and Tn5 digestion as described by Buenrostro et al., Tn5-fragmented DNA was cleaned up using a MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen #28004, four reactions per column eluted in 20 uL EB buffer) and the resulting 80 uL of eluate was split into 16 PCR reactions (Supplemental Note 2). PCR was performed using custom HPLC-purified primers (F: 5\u2032-TAGAGCATGCACCGGCAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNATGTCTCGTGGGC TCGGAGATGT-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 1, R: 5\u2032-GGCCGAATTCGTCGATCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTG-3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO. 2), NNNN corresponds to random 4nt i7 barcode sequence) and NEBNext Ultra II Q5 DNA polymerase master mix (NEB #M0544L). Thermocycler conditions were: 65 C for 5 min, 98 C for 30 sec, 8 cycles of: 98 C for 10 sec and 65 C for 90 sec. PCR reactions were pooled and 385 cleaned up with a Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit (two PCR reactions per column eluted in 20 uL EB buffer) and run on a 1% agarose E-Gel EX with SYBR Gold II stain (Thermo Fisher #G402001). Size selection of ATAC-seq fragments was performed by gel excision using a razor blade. Gel slabs were pooled into <300 mg groups and DNA was purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen #28604), and eluted in 20 uL of buffer EB per column following modified guidelines described in Box 2 of Taiwo et al. (2012)31. The resulting size-selected ATAC-seq fragment library was treated with an anti-mitochondrial DNA CRISPR/Cas9 library following the protocol outlined in Montefiori et al. using 10\u00d7 excess of Cas9 protein (Supplemental Note 3)32. Applicants cleaned up the reaction with a Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit and split into 8 PCR reactions for a second round of PCR using the same conditions and primers described above. PCR products were cleaned up using two rounds of AMPure bead selection (0.8\u00d7 ratio of beads to input) to size-select against small fragments, eluted in 40 uL of dH2O and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher #Q32854).",
                                "The pSTARR-seq_human plasmid used for generating the plasmid library was a gift from Alexander Stark (Addgene plasmid #71509). The linear backbone used for the subsequent cloning steps was generated by digesting 4 ug of circular pSTARR-seq_human for 4-6 hours with AgeI and SalI restriction enzymes (NEB #R3552S and R3138S), followed by gel excision under a dark reader transilluminator (Clare Chemical #DR22A) to extract a linear 3.5 kb fragment corresponding to the human STARR-seq plasmid backbone. Applicants performed cloning of the fragment library into the plasmid backbone approximately following the Methods section from Arnold et al. (2013)3. For each library, Applicants performed 20 individual InFusion HD cloning reactions (Takara Bio #638911) using a 3.5:1 molar ratio of insert to vector backbone, following manufacturer's instructions (Supplemental Note 4). Each group of five InFusion reactions was collected and cleaned up using the Qiagen MinElute Enzymatic Reaction cleanup kit, eluted in 10 uL of dH2O, and transformed into four 20 uL aliquots of MegaX DH10B T1R electrocompetent bacteria. The bacteria were thawed on ice for 10 min and mixed with eluted DNA (five InFusion reactions per 100 uL of bacteria). 22 uL of bacteria/DNA mixture were pipetted into a 0.1 cm electroporation cuvette (Thermo Fisher Scientific #P41050) and tapped repeatedly against a hard surface to remove bubbles. Cuvettes were electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell Microbial Electroporation System (Bio-Rad #1652662) using the conditions: 2.0 kV, 200\u03a9, 25 \u03bcF (Supplemental Note 5). For high-yield transformations, Applicants observed electroporation time constants between 4.8 and 5.1 ms. After electroporation, bacteria were immediately collected in 750 uL pre-warmed SOC media, pooled, and incubated for 1 hr in a 37 C shaker. After recovery, serial dilutions of bacteria were plated to estimate the number of clones in the library. Recovered bacteria were diluted in 2L of pre-warmed luria broth and 100 ug/mL of carbenicillin and grown overnight (8-10 hours while shaking). Plasmids were collected from bacteria using the Plasmid Plus MegaPrep kit (Qiagen #12981) following manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop One machine (Thermo Scientific) and diluted to a 3 ug/uL concentration for subsequent transfection steps. To ensure plasmid library quality and diversity, a small aliquot of the fragment library was amplified by PCR using i5 and i7 primers, run on an Illumina MiSeq machine using the 50-cycle v2 kit as per manufacturer's instructions, and aligned to the human genome to ensure correct complexity and sufficient proportions of reads within predicted transcriptional regulatory elements (Supplemental Note 6, see subsequent Methods sections for details on processing of sequencing libraries).",

Approximately 24 hours before transfection, GM12878 cells were split to a density of 4\u00d7105 cells/mL to ensure the presence of actively dividing cells for increased transfection efficiency. For transfection, cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 g, washed once with pre-warmed PBS, and collected again for 5 min at 300 g. PBS was aspirated and cell pellets were re-suspended in Resuspension Buffer R (Thermo Fisher Scientific #MPK10096) at a concentration of 7.5 million cells per 100 uL. DNA was added to cells at a concentration of 5 ug of plasmid per 1 million cells. In total, Applicants transfected between 120-130 million cells per replicate using 100 uL tips from the Neon Transfection System at 1200V with 3 pulses of 20 ms. Transfected cells were immediately recovered in pre-warmed GM12878 media without antibiotic and recovered at a density of 1\u00d7106 cells/mL for 24 hours. In parallel, Applicants performed two transfections of GM12878 cells with a positive control GFP plasmid to assess transfection efficiency using the same conditions.",

Poly A+RNA was extracted from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA Midi kit (Qiagen #70042, two columns per RNA sample), and any remaining DNA was digested with a second DNase treatment step using Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher #AM2238) following manufacturer's instructions (Supplemental Note 7). Treated mRNA was cleaned up and concentrated using the Qiagen RNEasy MinElute Cleanup kit (Qiagen #74204).

As some long reads have poor quality scores at their 3\u2032 end, Applicants trimmed low quality sequences (quality value <38) to reduce the proportion of sequencing errors at SNPs that could lead to incorrect allelic assignment of fragments. Fragments were then assigned to a SNP based on genotype at the position. For comparisons of SNP activity, Applicants only considered fragments with 90% mutual overlap to reduce the confounding effect of fragments that differ by both allele and position. Applicants also removed fragments if either end was within 25nt of a driver element, as in these cases small differences in end position could artifically lead to large effects.

If sequencing on an Illumina machine, fragments of this size do not cluster efficiently and can lead to poor sequencing results. Applicants tried a library with a wide length distribution of 600-1.5 kb, and found that large fragments (800nt and above) were very poorly represented in plasmid samples. Surprisingly, some of the strongest \u201cactive\u201d regions in RNA output were large fragments (1 kb and above)\u2014this is likely an artificial signal due to internal splicing of some large fragments, creating a smaller fragment that is very efficiently sequenced.

In our hands, Applicants experienced substantially lower transfection efficiencies and greater degree of arcing when using other electrocompetent cells (e.g. NEB 10-beta). Also, if this is your first time performing bacterial electroporations, Applicants recommend practicing a few times with the pUC19 positive control plasmid under different conditions.",
                                "6) The most important consideration for HiDRA library preparation is the expected complexity (number of unique fragments). If the complexity is too low, there will be insufficient fragments in most regulatory regions for high-resolution mapping. If library complexity is too high, more cells may need to be transfected for reliable activity readings, and DNA and RNA libraries will need to be sequenced to greater depth. While developing HiDRA, Applicants were able to generate plasmid libraries with over 30-50 million unique fragments (almost an order of magnitude greater than the data presented here), however this would require very large sequencing runs. In our experience, library complexity can be controlled in the (bottleneck) homology-based cloning step. Before proceeding through time-consuming and expensive transfection, RNA collection & RNA sequencing steps, Applicants recommend sequencing the plasmid library (MiSeq or spiking into a larger run) to estimate library complexity and proportion of reads within interesting regions (enhancers, promoters, etc).",
