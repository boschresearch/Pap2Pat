                        "2019 Novel Coronavirus (hereinafter referred to as \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d in some cases) is a coronavirus belonging to the SARS-associated coronaviruses, which was first identified its outbreak near Wuhan, China in 2019. It is pathogenic to humans and causes novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19).",
                        "Currently, WHO has shown the recognition that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is currently equivalent to a pandemic (global epidemic). On the other hand, no treatment has been established for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, in order to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of infection, it is extremely important to find patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 by rapid testing as well as to investigate the rate of infection, or route of infection by checking the antibody prevalence in serum using immunological tests.",
                        "As detection methods for SARS-CoV-2, genetic tests such as real-time reverse transcription-PCR using collected nasal swab, pharyngeal swab, or sputum as specimens (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2) are mainly used. By this, it is possible to determine the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, by the aforesaid genetic test, there happened many cases in which SARS-CoV-2 is not detected in aforesaid specimens (false negative) due to the influence by the location of collection, timing of collection, and storage method of specimen, even though the specimens are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this is one of the reasons of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, genetic testing requires a special device that detects fluorescence in real time during PCR, and it takes several hours to obtain the results, so it remains a problem from the viewpoint of early detection in places such as infection sites, quarantine sites, and clinical sites, where the facility is not sufficient. Thus, immunological tests using antigen-antibody reactions against SARS-CoV-2 derived proteins are required as tests that combine accuracy, speed, and convenience.",
                        "The spike (hereinafter referred to as \u201cS\u201d in some cases) protein, which is present on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and is involved in infection of host cells, is known as a protein derived from SARS-CoV-2 (Non-Patent Document 3). However, the SARS-CoV-2 derived S protein is a glycoprotein, which is made up of bound many sugar chains (Non-Patent Document 3), and it is considered extremely difficult to artificially prepare a protein that exactly reproduces its structure using chemical synthesis or genetically engineered microorganisms. The S protein derived from the SARS coronavirus, which is genetically related to SARS-CoV-2, is known to be easily mutated its amino acid sequence as the SARS coronavirus replicates (Non-Patent Document 4). Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 derived S protein is considered to be easily mutated in its amino acid sequence as SARS-CoV-2 replicates. For this reason, antibodies prepared against the SARS-CoV-2 derived S protein may not show antigen-antibody reactions against mutants of the S protein, and thus, there is a risk that immunological tests using antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 derived S protein may produce false negative test results depending on the specimens.",
                        "On the other hand, a protein constituting SARS-CoV-2 derived nucleocapsid (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNP\u201d in some cases) is also known as a SARS-CoV-2 derived protein. The NP derived from the SARS coronavirus, which is genetically related to SARS-CoV-2, is known to be the most abundant among the various SARS coronavirus-derived proteins produced by infection (Non-Patent Document 5), and likewise, SARS-CoV-2 derived NPs are thought to be the most abundant of the various SARS-CoV-2 derived proteins produced by infection. For this reason, SARS-CoV-2 derived NPs are expected to be relatively easy to detect from specimens. In fact, a case of a preparation of antibody against a partial peptide of SARS-CoV-2 derived NP has already been reported (Non-Patent Document 6). However, the antibodies prepared in said case shows the antigen-antibody reaction against NPs derived from MERS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus, and does not have a specificity for the SARS-CoV-2 derived NP (Non-Patent Document 6). Hence, in immunological tests using said antibody, there is a risk of producing false positive test results depending on the specimen."

Subsequently the electrophoresed gels were transferred to PVDF membranes. After the membranes were blocked with 2% skimmed milk solution, the membranes were allowed to react with peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibodies (#7, #98). After that, after reacting with HRP-labeled secondary antibody, peroxidase substrate solution was added to emit light, and the light emission was detected using a chemiluminescence imaging system.",
