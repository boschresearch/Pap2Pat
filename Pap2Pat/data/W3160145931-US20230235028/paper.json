    "title": "Highly specific monoclonal antibodies and epitope identification against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein for antigen detection tests",
    "date": "2021-06-01",
    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global public health concern. Although rapid point-of-care testing for detecting viral antigen is important for management of the outbreak, the current antigen tests are less sensitive than nucleic acid testing. In our current study, we produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that exclusively react with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and exhibit no cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling suggests that the mAbs bind to epitopes present on the exterior surface of the nucleocapsid, making them suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. We further select the optimal pair of anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) mAbs using ELISA and then use this mAb pair to develop immunochromatographic assay augmented with silver amplification technology. Our mAbs recognize the variants of concern (501Y.V1-V3) that are currently in circulation. Because of their high performance, the mAbs of this study can serve as good candidates for developing antigen detection kits for COVID-19.",

                "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), happens to be the most recent threat to mankind causing major public health issues across the world.1 Breaking out of all containment efforts, the virus has spread across international borders to cause a massive pandemic.2 Urgent measures are required to tackle this outbreak, as countries worldwide have reported over 127 million infections and 2.7 million deaths.3 As the complete details about the nature and pathogenicity of the virus still remain enigmatic, it would be only wise to limit new infections to as low as possible.",
                "Despite the urgency of the situation, rapid diagnostic methods and point-of-care testing (POCT) that can be used to make immediate and on-site diagnostic decisions have not been convincingly established.4 Current diagnostic methods for COVID-19 are deployed after medical examination for the presence of clinical features, such as fever and cough and history of exposure or travel. This strategy fails to detect the asymptomatically infected people who could act as an unidentified source to propagate the disease in the community.5 At present, the recommended methods to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19 principally employ nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs), such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which are difficult to scale up for performing on a multitude of patients at the clinical sites.6,7 This underscores the need for a de-centralized, simple, reliable, and rapid POCT for diagnosing COVID-19 at a mass scale.",
                "Viral antigen detection is a convenient method to directly demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals as compared to NAT and can provide test results in a much shorter time span of under 30\u00a0min. The performance of an antigen-detection kit principally relies on employing high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that precisely target specific viral antigens. Certain antigen-detection kits currently approved for the diagnosis of COVID-19 utilize mAbs against SARS-CoV to detect SARS-CoV-2.8, 9, 10 This may result in the inadequate specificity as well as sensitivity because the epitope regions become less immunogenic due to amino acid substitutions between viral species. Furthermore, multiple viral variants with increasing infectivity and transmissibility have emerged continuously.11 It has been reported that some genetic mutations may cause false-negative results in NAT.12 Also, currently approved kits have not disclosed such information with detailed epitope analysis.8,13",
                "Nucleocapsid protein (NP) is a viral antigen that organizes the single-stranded RNA into a helical capsid structure. NP is abundantly expressed during SARS-CoV-2 replication and is highly immunogenic, making it a suitable target for antigen testing.14 This advantage, however, comes with a drawback of SARS-CoV-2 NP exhibiting high homology with the NP of other human coronaviruses, leading to the problem of cross-reactivity, which could be the reason for the unavailability of accurate antigen-detection tests. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical to SARS-CoV (\u223c90% identity), because of which none of the currently available mAbs discriminate SARS-CoV-2 NP from that of SARS-CoV.15 Hence, it is a pressing demand to create mAbs that can exclusively target SARS-CoV-2 in order to establish a precise antigen-detection kit for reliable diagnosis of COVID-19.",
                "The production of high-precision mAb is essentially determined by the quality of antigen before immunization.16,17 Preparation of high-quality antigen is essential for generating specific mAbs that recognize the native form of the corresponding viral antigen.16 The wheat germ cell-free protein production system is a sophisticated approach based on the eukaryotic translation apparatus of wheat seeds, with significant advantages over other commonly used protein expression systems for large-scale protein production.18,19 Owing to the eukaryotic translation machinery, this system can synthesize properly folded and biologically active proteins identical to those expressed in mammalian cells.20 These advantages highlight the suitability of this system for the generation of practically relevant antigenic proteins that can be used to immunize animals and generate mAbs. In our previous study, we were able to demonstrate favorable results upon producing NP of Middle-East severe respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus using this system.21",
                "In the current study, we have synthesized recombinant SARS-CoV-2 NP and produced mAbs that could specifically detect this protein. We also determined the optimal pair of the newly produced anti-NP mAbs to develop antigen capture ELISA and lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for sensitive and definitive detection of SARS-CoV-2."

                        "NP has conserved amino acid (aa) residues at the N-terminal domain (NTD) (aas 1\u2013120) that are homologous among human coronaviruses.22 We produced N-terminal truncated nucleocapsid protein (\u0394N-NP; aas 121\u2013419) devoid of the homologous residues and used it as an immunogen to produce mAbs that are specific for SARS-CoV-2. His-tagged \u0394N-NP was successfully expressed using wheat germ extracts and was purified as a soluble protein for immunization to BALB/c mice (Figure\u00a0S1A). After 4\u00a0weeks of immunization, lymphocytes were harvested from the immunized mice and were fused with mouse myeloma cells to establish 144 stable hybridomas designated as nos. 1\u2013144 (Figure\u00a01A). The mAbs generated from these hybridomas were subjected to assess their reactivity to intact NP antigen by indirect ELISA, AlphaScreen, and Bio-Layer Interferometry (Figure\u00a01B). Consequently, we selected 12 hybridoma clones that had high reactivity and affinity to the antigen in all three methods and next performed the immunoblot-based screening, where we sought to identify the mAbs that can specifically react with SARS-CoV-2 NP, but not with other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. Of the 12 clones, three clones (no. 7, no. 9, and no. 98) were found to be completely specific to SARS-CoV-2 NP, exhibiting no cross-reactivity with other related viruses (Figure\u00a01C), although the remaining clones showed cross-reactivity only to SARS-CoV (Figure\u00a0S1B). Isotype analysis revealed that mAb no. 9 belonged to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa isotype although both no. 7 and no. 98 belonged to IgG2b kappa isotype (Figure\u00a01D).Figure\u00a01Production of high-affinity and specific mAb against SARS-CoV-2 NP using wheat germ cell-free synthesized antigen(A) Schematic diagram of hybridoma cells production to generate anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP mAb. Purified protein was injected into BALB/c mice. After 4\u00a0weeks, lymphocytes from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells, and 144 hybridoma cells were established.(B) Of the 144 clones, the 12 that exhibited high reactivity to antigen proteins, as revealed by indirect ELISA, AlphaScreen, and Bio-layer interferometry, were selected for further investigation (two technical replicates).

                        "We next performed an ELISA-based epitope mapping to determine the antibody-binding sites using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 NP and its deletion mutants (Figure\u00a0S2). We found that our newly developed mAbs recognized three distinct regions in NP: mAb no. 7 bound to 210\u2013231 aas and mAb no. 98 bound to 382\u2013397 aas (Figure\u00a01E). Because mAb no. 9 did not react with many deletion mutants of C-terminal domain (CTD) (264\u2013365 aas), we inferred that this problem could be due to the conformational changes due to inappropriate protein folding in deletion mutants. To overcome this trouble, we produced substitution mutants in which each region of the CTD was recombined with a homologous region of MERS-NP and examined the reactivity of the antibodies. With this design, ELISA analysis showed that mAb no. 9 bound to 335\u2013348 aas (Figure\u00a0S2).",
                        "We next confirmed the antigenic discrimination ability of our newly developed mAbs. Multiple alignments of NPs derived from various human coronaviruses were carried out to examine the identity of epitope regions. Consistent with specificity analysis in Figure\u00a01C, all the binding sites were found to be specific to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure\u00a0S3A). The numbers of distinct aas contributing to specific recognition of mAb to SARS-CoV-2 NP, but not SARS-CoV NP, were four for mAb no. 7 and one each for mAbs no. 9 and no. 98. There were more than 5 aa differences in the antibody epitopes of other human coronaviruses (Figure\u00a0S3A). To identify the critical residue of specificity in the epitope of each mAb, we created site-directed mutation with single-amino-acid substitution and examined the reactivity by ELISA. The results showed that Ala217 for no. 7, Asn345 for no. 9, and Gln390 for no. 98 were critical residues to discriminate SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure\u00a0S3B).",
                        "We next investigated whether the antigenic epitopes were located on the exterior surface of the nucleocapsid. Because the structure of full-length nucleocapsid protein has not been elucidated, homology modeling was carried out using previously reported partial structures of SARS-CoV-2 NP (PDB: 6M3M; PDB: 6YUN).23,24 Molecular modeling of dimeric SARS-CoV-2 NP revealed that binding regions for all three mAbs were located on the surface of the protein (Figure\u00a01E). Furthermore, these regions were spatially separated in the 3D structure, indicating the possibility to simultaneously use a pair of different mAbs to develop antigen-sandwich-detection assays."

We collected 8,127 complete genomes that were registered in the NCBI database at the start of the study. Shannon entropy analysis revealed that the entire aa sequences of NP were highly conserved except for three high-frequency substitutions, S194L, R203K, and G204R, which were same as previously described (Figure\u00a0S4A).25 We observed that the epitope of each of the mAbs was completely conserved and devoid of any mutation in the current circulating mutants of SARS-CoV-2, including 501Y.V1, 501Y.V2, and 501Y.V3 (Figure\u00a0S4B). Furthermore, all binding sites were highly conserved among the different strains of SARS-CoV-2 with more than 99% identity (Figure\u00a0S5A). We next performed site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the binding site mutations into SARS-CoV-2 NP and examined the effect on the reactivity of mAbs by ELISA analysis (Figure\u00a0S5B). Despite the mutations, our mAbs were able to bind to the mutated NPs at\u00a0a rate of 99.9% for no. 7, 99.86% for no. 9, and 99.84% for no. 98."

Therefore, we evaluated the optimal pair of mAbs that can be employed for this purpose by testing all possible combinations of immobilized and labeled mAbs. The combination of no. 9 and no. 98 exhibited best signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios as compared to other pairs (Figure\u00a03B). We used this combination to establish the SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen-capture ELISA with mAb no. 9 in the stationary phase and mAb no. 98 as the conjugate with horseradish peroxidase (HRP).

We utilized silver halide photography technology for output signal amplification in our LFIA (Figures 4A, S7A, and S7B).26,27 In this technology, silver ions are allowed to adhere to the surface of gold nanoparticles (approx. 0.05\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter), which allows the electrons from the solution to reduce the silver atoms. This causes further attachment and reduction within a period of 30 s, resulting in the congregation of reduced silver ions upon the gold nanoparticles to cause size enhancement (approx. 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) that provides a remarkable improvement in visibility (Figures 4B and 4C).

Subsequent study with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles revealed that the lowest detection limit of virus copy number corresponded to 6.3\u00a0\u00d7 104 copies/mL (Figure\u00a04G). This was tested in parallel experiments with commercially available LFIA kits, Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test, Roche SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antibody Test, SD Biosensor Standard Q COVID-19 Ag, and Fujirebio Espline SARS-CoV-2, to reveal that our LFIA detected the lowest amount of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the above-mentioned commercial kits (Figure\u00a04G). Furthermore, our LFIA could detect all the three major circulating mutants of SARS-CoV-2; 501Y.V1-3 (Figure\u00a04H).",
                        "We next evaluated the performance of the developed LFIA using clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swab) that had been diagnosed by RT-PCR. Our LFIA did not show false positives (n\u00a0= 63), revealing that the specificity was 100% (Figure\u00a04I). Comparison experiments using nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n\u00a0= 90) revealed that other antigen detection kits did not show false positives too. Nevertheless, none had a sensitivity as high as the LFIA developed in this study (Figure\u00a04I). Notably, our LFIA performed better when compared to other antigen-detection kits in samples with intermediate viral load Ct values (Ct\u00a0=\u00a028\u201331) and low viral load Ct values (Ct > 31; Figure\u00a04I). These results indicate that the LFIA designed with our newly developed mAbs could be useful for rapid and efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen."

                "Nearing a year since the outbreak, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread unchecked, causing serious health concerns worldwide. Apart from finding specific antiviral agents and vaccines, establishing a test for immediate detection of the infected and screening mass populations to initiate appropriate quarantine measures is necessary to control the spread of infection. The World Health Organization stresses that diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical to track the virus, understand its epidemiology to inform case management, and suppress transmission.28 As of now, RT-PCR is the primary test available for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19. Although NAT is sensitive and accurate, it requires specific equipment and trained personnel in laboratories with centralized services and takes a few hours to obtain results. Owing to their simplicity and ease of use, LFIA-based antigen detection kits can serve as POCT that can provide immediate results for prompt therapeutic or prophylactic actions. These advantages warrant the need for a reliable antigen detection kit that can supplement or supplant molecular diagnostics. To date, several antigen detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 are commercially available; however, almost all of them face the problem of cross-reactivity to other human coronaviruses, not revealing epitopes or specificities of antibodies, and may not be able to respond to forthcoming viral mutations.8,29",
                "In the current study, we have developed robust antigen-detection systems using newly synthesized high-affinity mAbs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 devoid of cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV. While designing an antigen detection system, NP appears to be a good choice as the target antigen because it is abundantly expressed in replicating virions and is highly immunogenic. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, NP is widely being used in serological diagnostic tests.14 However, due to its high homology with other human coronaviruses, mAbs generated with whole NP of SARS-CoV-2 may potentially cross-react with antigens of other human coronaviruses, causing false-positive reactions in non-COVID-19 cases.30, 31, 32 To overcome the problem of cross-reactivity, we produced \u0394N-NP (aas 121\u2013419) by deleting the conserved homologous aa sequences at the NTD and used this antigen to generate mAbs specific for SARS-CoV-2. We successfully created three specific mAbs that exclusively react with SARS-CoV-2 NP and not with any of the other related human coronaviruses.",
                "Preparation of high-quality antigen is the most critical pre-requisite for creating specific mAbs. Synthetic peptides containing predicted viral immunogenic epitopes are widely used to immunize animals for commercial generation of mAbs.33,34 However, synthetic peptides are often linear and therefore are not ideally representative of the native features of antigens with regard to their actual spatial structures. Indeed, a previous study has demonstrated that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP mAbs created with the antigenic peptides were found to cross-react with other coronaviruses.35 Also, the study showed that the sensitivity of the antigen-detection ELISA designed with antigenic peptide-derived mAbs was not so high (\u223c100\u00a0ng/mL).35 To overcome these problems, we synthesized the SARS-CoV-2 \u0394N-NP with the wheat germ cell-free system. This system makes use of a eukaryotic translation machinery to synthesize properly folded and biologically active proteins structurally identical to those expressed in mammalian cells.18,19 Although the antigen we used in this study was N-terminally deficient, it is highly likely to have a multimeric structure because of the presence of an oligomer-forming domain at the C-terminal dimerization domain.36,37 Because the epitopes for our newly developed mAbs were exposed on the surface of the dimerized NP proteins, our antibodies were able to bind with native viral antigens. Yet another salient feature of these mAbs was that they detected the three major variants of concern (501Y.V1, 501Y.V2, and 501Y.V3) because these rampantly circulating mutants do not possess any mutations in the epitope-binding sites of our mAbs. These characteristics highlight the practical applicability of our mAbs for developing rapid antigen detection assays for COVID-19.",
                "The overall sensitivity of our antigen-detection ELISA was 75.0%. However, we observed that the sensitivity increased with lower Ct values, and a similar trend was noticed even with the LFIA. Bullard et\u00a0al.38 reveal that viable and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virions are present only in respiratory samples with Ct values <24 although higher Ct values comprise non-infectious genetic material. Both our ELISA and LFIA achieved 100% sensitivity when tested on PCR-positive clinical specimens with Ct values <28, suggesting that they might not miss out the detection of viable and transmissible viruses. However, further viral culture analysis is required to confirm this. The LFIA developed in our study differs from its conventional counterparts by possessing output signal amplification using silver halide photography technology.26 Output signal-amplification techniques augment the performance of LFIAs by increasing their sensitivity.39,40",
                "Our antigen-detection assays can be expected to perform as a clinical diagnostic tool. By detecting cultured SARS-CoV-2 particles as low as 6.3\u00a0\u00d7 104 copies/mL, our LFIA was more sensitive than other commercially available antigen-detection kits. Furthermore, our LFIA showed high sensitivity using clinical specimens, especially in samples with intermediate (Ct\u00a0= 28\u201331) and low viral load (Ct > 31). On the other hand, there were slight discrepancies in the performance of each LFIA while detecting SARS-CoV-2 in culture supernatants and clinical specimens. For example, Fujirebio showed higher sensitivity than SD Biosensor in culture supernatants, although the latter performed better than the former in clinical specimens. This may be in part attributable to the property of clinical specimens, such as viscosity or presence of assay inhibitors. Further large-scale studies will be necessary to precisely identify the factors that may affect the performance of the assay in clinical samples, including saliva and sputum.",
                "Like RT-PCR, antigen-detection tests also face the problem of handling infectious material, which can pose hazard to the handling persons. However, this could be overcome by inactivating the virus in the swab soon after collection by immersing into extracting solutions that contain surfactants. Previous reports have demonstrated that more than 0.1% of the non-ionic surfactant, such as NP-40 or Triton X-100, completely inactivates SARS-CoV-2.41 We used extraction buffer containing non-ionic surfactant (0.5% for ELISA and 0.1% for LFIA), which did not cause any hindrance to the performance of the antigen-detection tests. Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 was actually verified by the extraction buffer used in our study (data not shown)."

We have found that Ala217 for no. 7, Asn345 for no. 9, and Gln390 for no. 98 were the critical residues to discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV. Although our tests effectively distinguished both the viruses in clinical specimen, it is necessary to perform crystal structure analysis to confirm whether the epitope of the antibody is indeed present on the surface of NP. Our analysis did not include additional patient cohort for independent validation because we mainly dealt with the development of mAbs and their usage for antigen-detection assays. Clinical studies with a larger sample size through prospective trials are needed to validate our ELISA and LFIA before considering for clinical application. If this is done, our antigen-detection assays could possibly meet the urgent demand for rapid testing in clinical and community settings and support the unprecedented global fight against COVID-19."
