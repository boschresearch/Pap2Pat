                        "Breast cancer is an extremely important disease in Irish Society. It is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in Irish women (with over 2,600 new diagnoses annually), and accounts for the greatest number of cancer related deaths in women. With 1 in 8 Irish women being diagnosed with breast cancer, it is a disease which impacts, in some way, most peoples lives. Breast cancer is an extremely prevalent disease accounting for the greatest number of cancers diagnosed and the greatest number of deaths from cancer in women in Ireland. When diagnosed and treated early, breast cancer is a highly curable disease, and the past decade has witnessed major advances in its management. However, many women continue to die from this disease process as a consequence of late diagnosis, with incurable metastases at the time of presentation. The focus of the invention is on the development of sensitive, specific, minimally invasive biomarkers for breast cancer that can be utilised to detect early tumours, as well as being applied to monitoring the response to treatment, and detecting disease recurrence. MiRNAs are a class of small, non-coding RNA fragments that have captured the attention and innovation of the scientific community since their discovery almost twenty years ago. The discovery that MiRNAs are dysregulated in several disease processes, including carcinogenesis, has unveiled their putative role as disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",
                        "Currently diagnosis of breast cancer involves a combination of clinical examination, radiological imaging and an invasive tissue biopsy, to provide histological confirmation. Mammography is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosis, yet it is not without its constraints, with both ionisation exposure and a false positive rate of up to 10%. Small curable early cancers can potentially be missed. When diagnosed promptly, women are more likely to have early stage disease, confined to the breast. These cases are amenable to breast conserving surgery. In cases where tumour cells have metastasised to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis more extensive local surgery and auxiliary surgery (an auxiliary lymph node clearance is often required). This procedure carries the potential for severe complications, including lymphoedema, which impacts extensively on one's quality of life. More over, tumour cells in the lymph nodes may be an indicator of distant metastases elsewhere, that are undetectable by current strategies. Current practice demands that the majority of these women receive adjunct chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapies. The decision to commence such regiments should not be taken lightly as each of these treatment modalities has an associate cluster of adverse effects. The appropriateness of adjunct therapy is usually based on a culmination of histological and patient factors. Only two predicted markers are validated and routinely assessed in the management of breast cancer. One of these is Oestrogen Receptor (ER) status and the other is Her2/neureceptor status. These markers indicate that there is a likely benefit to be achieved from treatment with hormonal therapies or Trastuzumab, respectively.",
                        "MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA fragments that are ideal biomarker candidates and therapeutic targets. MiRNAs have been demonstrated to play a key role in practically all aspects of the cell cycle. They function at a post-transcriptional level to cause either transcriptional cleavage or transcriptional repression. MiRNAs are abberently expressed in almost all pathological conditions, including carcinogenesis and have a putative role as oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes. MiRNAs have the advantage that they can be detected in the systemic circulation, and thus diagnostic assay is based on miRNAs are not invasive.",
                        "The concept of breast screening is now accepted internationally and is associated with an improved outcome from breast cancer due to its earlier diagnosis. However, it is not without its drawbacks; a high proportion of lobular carcinomas are mammographically occult dense breasts make the interpretation of the mammogram difficult and there are high false negative rates. Therefore, the development of a blood based diagnostic tool would be a significant advantage as it would permit screening to begin at a younger age and could potentially successfully diagnose tumours which are not detectable by mammography.",
                        "Over the past decade our understanding of breast cancer has advanced remarkably. It is a heterogeneous disease, with distinct molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2/neu over-expressing and Basal). Luminal A is the most common sub-type of breast cancer with over 70% of breast tumours falling into this category. Luminal A tumours are characterised by hormone receptor positivity (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and HER2/neu negativity. Women diagnosed with Luminal A tumours typically have a good prognosis, with a five year survival over 90%. However, with most breast tumours being Luminal A, it forms a good starting point on which to base a diagnostic test.",

MiRNA expression in cell lines cannot be directly correlated with expression in the bloodstream of a patient. In particular, this paper shows over expression of miR-652 in the cell line whereas the present study shows under-expression of the same marker in whole blood. Furthermore, Pigati et al (PLOS ONE, vol. 5, issue 10, e13515) report that released miRNAs do not necessarily reflect the abundance of miRNA in the cell of origin."

Ethical approval was obtained and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants in advance of blood sampling. Women with breast cancer were identified at the Symptomatic Breast Unit where they were referred by their General Practitioner for investigation of a newly palpable breast lesion, or other symptoms suggestive of malignancy. All women in the cancer group had Luminal A breast cancer which was confirmed by histology, immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Demographic details and clinicopathological parameters were prospectively collected. Whole blood samples were prospectively collected from women with a new diagnosis of Luminal A breast cancer, at the time of diagnosis. Whole blood samples were also collected from healthy female volunteers who served as the control group. Venous non-fasting whole blood was collected in BD Vacutainer K2E blood bottles containing 18 mg EDTA as an anticoagulant (BD-Plymouth), immediately transferred to the surgical laboratory and stored at minus 4\u00b0 C. until required.",

Each RNA sample was reverse transcribed for each specific miRNA target primer, and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was then conducted using the appropriate TaqMan miRNA primers and probes, as described by the manufacturer. In brief, 100 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using MultiScribe, followed by RT-qPCR on a 7900 HR Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate for each target miRNA, and for each RNA sample. Inter-assay controls and intra-assay controls were used throughout.

        "1. A diagnostic kit for the detection of breast cancer or to assist prognosis, or determine the efficacy of a treatment regime for breast cancer in a patient in need thereof, comprising at least one oligonucleotide probe capable of binding to at least a portion of a circulating miRNA selected from the group comprising miR-181a and miR-652 biomarkers, and a receptacle for containing blood.",
        "2. A kit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the receptacle contains an anti-coagulant.",
        "3. A kit as claimed in claim 1, comprising an oligonucleotide probe capable of binding to at least a portion of a circulating miRNA-181a and an oligonucleotide probe capable of binding to at least a portion of the circulating miR-652.",
        "4. A kit as claimed in claim 1, further comprising reagents adapted for performance of an assay selected from a real-time PCR assay, a micro-array assay, histochemical assay or an immunological assay.",
        "5. A kit as claimed in claim 1, wherein the breast cancer comprises Luminal A breast cancer.",
        "6. A method of identifying a therapeutic agent capable of preventing or treating cancers, including breast cancer, comprising testing the ability of the potential therapeutic agent to enhance the expression of at least one circulating miRNA selected from the group comprising miR-181a and miR-652.",
        "7. A method to stratify a breast cancer patient according to expected prognosis or to assess the efficacy of a medical treatment comprising detecting circulating miRNA selected from miR-181a and miR-652 in a whole blood sample isolated from the patient.",
        "8. A method to detect breast cancer, to stratify patients according to expected prognosis or to assess the efficacy of a medical treatment in a patient in need thereof, comprising detecting circulating miRNA miR 642 in a sample isolated from the patient.",
        "9. A method as claimed in claim 8, wherein the sample comprises a blood sample or a sample derived from blood.",
        "10. A method of detecting or screening for an early stage breast cancer comprising analysing a sample of whole blood taken from a patient for the presence of one or more biomarkers selected from the group comprising miR-181a and miR-652, wherein a decreased level of miR-181a or miR-652 in the sample, when compared to a control, indicates the presence of breast cancer in a patient.",
        "11. A method of detecting or screening for luminal A breast cancer comprising analysing a sample of whole blood taken from a patient for the presence of the combination of the biomarkers miR-181a and miR-652, wherein a decreased level of miR-181 a and miR-652 in the sample, when compared to a control, indicates the presence of luminal A breast cancer in the patient."
