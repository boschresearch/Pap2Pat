# METHODS

Device fabrication. Vertically-aligned arrays of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were grown on Si substrates using a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process at 850 ¬∞C and 1 kPa in an Aixtron Black Magic ¬© reactor with C 2 H 2 as the carbon source gas. Ti, Al, and Fe films with thicknesses of 100, 10, and 3 nm were evaporated onto the Si as support as catalyst layers for MWCNT growth. To allow probing away from the active area of the devices, a SiO x barrier layer (250 nm) was deposited on half of the Si substrate (Fig. 1a). The growth time was between 1 to 3 minutes to produce MWCNTs with average heights of ~ 10 ¬µm. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure of MWCNTs and their coatings. The average diameters of the MWCNTs are approximately 8-10 nm and the average number of walls is 6 (Fig. 1c). Al 2 O 3 dielectric layers of 8, 12, or 15 nm were deposited on the MWCNTs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 250 ¬∞C using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water (H 2 O) vapors. These thicknesses are based on optimized ALD cycles (100 cycles = 10 nm), which were calibrated on planar Si substrates. Purge times of 30 seconds were used in each ALD cycle for both TMA and H 2 O to enable TMA and H 2 O vapor to diffuse completely from the MWCNT tips to the substrate base. In between two sets of ALD, oxygen plasma was used to oxidize the surface of the MWCNTs and introduce hydrophilic moieties 16,17 (-OH and -COOH), which promotes uniform nucleation (Fig. 1b and1c) and conformal deposition of Al 2 O 3 on the MWCNTs. A metal top contact of Ca (40 nm)/Al (20 nm), or 100 nm Al for the device in Fig. 2b and 2e, was then vacuum (base pressure less than 10 -7 torr) deposited on the arrays using a shadow mask to form the MWCNT rectenna devices. The source metals were from Lesker and purity of 99% or greater. The Al layer is required to prevent or minimize oxidation of Ca in air.

Electrical measurements. The current-voltage ùêº ùëâ dc characteristics of MWCNT-I-M rectenna were measured using an Agilent E5272A source monitor unit connected to a DC electrical probing station with a temperature-controlled stage. The resistance of the probe and lead wires is on the order of 1 Œ©. Capacitance-frequency characteristics were measured using HP 4284 capacitance meter at room temperature. The capacitance, and the operating electric field strength limits in MWCNT-I-M devices were established by measuring specific capacitances as a function of DC bias for oxide thicknesses of 8 and 15 nm at a frequency of 10 5 Hz and 20 mV rms . The work functions of MWCNTs were measured in air using a Kelvin probe (Besocke Delta Phi) with reference to a highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystal sample. Electrical and optical tests were performed in a glove box under a nitrogen environment, and at near atmospheric pressure and temperature, except for the temperature dependent current-voltage scans.

Optical measurements. An infrared (IR) continuous waveform laser with 1064 nm wavelength (282 THz) at intensities of 92 mW cm -2 and 243 mW cm -2 ; green continuous waveform laser with 532 nm wavelength (564 THz) at an intensity of 26 mW cm -2 ; and AM 1.5 solar simulation source at an intensity of 100 mW cm -2 were used to test rectenna response. The angle of illumination was aligned to the surface normal, except in measurements as a function of polarization as discussed below. The estimated transmissivity of the top metal contact (40 nm Ca/20 nm Al) for the tested wavelengths is 10% based on measurements with the same contact film composition on a transparent substrate. The polarization of the IR laser (the output is linearly polarized) was controlled using a half waveplate, and a linear polarizer. The open circuit voltage response as a function of polarization was measured by rotating polarization angle of the laser beam with respect to the MWCNT antenna alignment, and aligning the illumination at 45 degrees from the surface normal. All measurements were performed at room temperature.     where, J o = e 2œÄ hŒîs 2 , and

It should be noted that the expression for Œª used here is a factor of 2 smaller than the original Simmons equation, which was in error as noted by Miskovsky et al. 7 For intermediate voltages (eV > œÜ 1 ) s 2 is:

and for high voltages (eV > œÜ 1 ):

) Œµ is the dielectric constant of the insulator, and its value is taken to be 5.1 as determined from the measured capacitance values for 8 nm thin ALD deposited Al 2 O 3 barrier on planar surface (see section S3 below). s is the barrier thickness and Œîs = s 2 -s 1 and ŒîœÜ = œÜ 2 -œÜ 1 . The barrier height at the metallic electrode is the difference between the electrode work function and the electron affinity of the oxide barrier. The barrier height, œÜ 1 = 1.9 eV for Ca, œÜ 1 = 3.3 eV for Al, and œÜ 2 = 4.1 eV for MWCNT was taken in the above expressions. All parameters in the current density equation were held constant except for the barrier thickness. A threshold current of 1 ¬µA was set and the effective barrier thickness that would produce the threshold current was calculated. The area used for the current calculation was the projected device area (0.01 cm 2 ) multiplied by the fill fraction of the MWCNTs (0.005) for an effective area of 5 √ó10 -5 cm 2 . Because the two devices were identical except for the work function of the metal electrode, it was expected that the difference between the work function of Ca and Al could account for the difference in turnon voltages that was observed experimentally. Since the deposited barrier thickness was the same in both devices, it is expected that the modeled effective barrier thickness of each device would also be the same. The physical barrier thickness of the device is 8 nm, but this does not account for the electron tunneling enhancement produced by the concentrated electric field at the tips of the MWCNTs. The effective electron tunneling barrier thickness (s eff ) was determined to be approximately 1.5 nm for both Ca and Al. These are the barrier thickness in a planar device that would produce 1 ¬µA of current at the respective turn-on voltages. A plot of the theoretical current-voltage for Ca and Al planar devices with the aforementioned barrier thickness are shown in Fig. S3. This result provided confirmation that the difference in work function of the two top metals was responsible for the change in turn-on voltage between the two device types.

Different CNT growth conditions or substrates can produce MWCNT structures with different morphology and can result in different electrical properties and work functions. 14 The work functions of MWCNTs grown on Si substrates with different resistivities were measured by Kelvin probe on three different spots on the same sample and on MWCNTs grown in different batches (Fig. S6a). The MWCNTs that were grown on medium resistivity Si substrates (0.01-0.05 Œ©.cm) exhibited a higher work function (5 eV) than the work function of MWCNTs that were grown on low resistivity Si (0.001-0.005 Œ©.cm), which was 4.8 eV. The MWCNTs with 5 eV work function were used in the devices in the main text.

In order to correlate the diode current rectification with the bottom MWCNT electrode work function, Al 2 O 3 was deposited on the two MWCNT samples followed by the deposition of a Ca top metal electrode. The inset in Fig. S6a indicates clearly that the rectification in the current for a given applied dc bias is higher in devices that use MWCNTs with a higher work function. These results were reproducible on several devices as shown in Fig. S6. Evaluation of the samples in scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed that the MWCNTs that were grown on low resistivity substrates were less straight in comparison to the MWCNTs that were grown on medium resistivity substrates (Fig. S6b andS6c). The higher degree of CNT waviness could explain the lower work functions measured on the MWCNTs grown on low resistivity Si substrates because such waviness could increase defects, entanglement, and as a result cause a substantial decrease in the electrical conductivity of the MWCNTs.  

### S3. Capacitance measurements of MWCNT-O-M diode arrays

The measured capacitances (ùê∂) based on the apparent device area (0.1 cm 2 ) of MWCNT-I-M diode arrays with different oxide thicknesses (Fig. 2c) were nearly constant in a standard low frequency range (up to 10 6 Hz). The results do not show the inverse thickness relation of a conventional parallel plate capacitor because the permittivity of nanoscale oxide insulators can decrease with thickness. 16 For the MWCNT-O-M arrays fabricated with 8 nm Al 2 O 3 , specific capacitance of approximately 3.4 ¬µF/cm 2 or roughly 2 attofarads per MWCNT junction, and a dielectric constant (Œµ) of 3.8 can be extracted using the following expression 

The measured capacitance is 1.7 nF for an 8 nm oxide (Fig. 2c). The measured MWCNT diameter is approximately 8 nm, so the area of a MWCNT tip = œÄ x 4 2 x 10 -14 cm 2 = 50.24 x 10 -14 cm 2 . Based on the number density of MWCNTs estimated from SEM images, there are approximately 10 9 MWCNTs in an area of 0.1 cm 2 . Therefore, the actual area A = 50.24 x 10 -14 cm 2 x 10 9 = 50.24 x 10 -5 cm 2 . Hence, the specific capacitance C/A = 1.75 nF/50.24 x 10 -5 cm 2 = 0.0338 x 10 -4 F/cm 2 = 3.38 x 10 -6 F/cm 2 = 3.38 ¬µF/cm 2 . The dielectric constant (Œµ) of 3.8 can be extracted from the calculated specific capacitance for 8 nm oxide by using the equation, ( )

Similarly, the capacitance per junction can be evaluated by dividing the measured capacitance (1.7 nF) by the number of MWCNTs in an area of 0.1 cm 2 (10 9 MWCNT). Hence, the capacitance per junction is 1.7 nF/10 9 , which is 1.7 x 10 -18 F.

The measured capacitances (at 1 kHz and 20 mV rms ) of the planar Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca devices with 8 nm of oxide as a function of area (ranging from 0.01-0.04 cm 2 ) are shown in Fig. S7. The capacitance per unit area (C/A) as extracted from the linear fit of the slope of capacitance versus area curve is 569 nF/cm 2 . Using the value of C/A in a conventional parallel plate capacitor model where capacitance is given by equation ( 8), a dielectric constant (ùúÄ) of 5.14 is calculated for the ALD deposited 8 nm Al 2 O 3 .

## S1. Turn-on voltage, field enhancement, effective barrier thickness, and asymmetry

Two different metal electrodes with different work functions were tested to correlate the effect of metal work function on rectification ratio and turn-on voltage. Several multiwall carbon nanotube-insulator-metal (MWCNT-I-M) devices were fabricated in the same batch to produce similar array heights. These arrays were then coated with 8 nm of Al 2 O 3 in the same atomic layer deposition (ALD) run. The turn-on voltage of MWCNT-I-M devices with Ca (work function ~ 2.9 eV) and Al (work function ~ 4.3 eV) top metal electrodes was determined based on the experimental current-voltage curves. The turn-on voltage was defined as the voltage at which a line fit to a linear portion of the current-voltage curve intercepts the y-axis (i.e., zero current, which is chosen to be 1 ¬µA). This choice in definition of the turn-on voltage is arbitrary, so the main purpose of this analysis to create a self-consistent picture in which to compare the effects of work function on the onset of significant nonlinearity in our devices, and to estimate the extent of insulator barrier thinning due to geometric field enhancement. Figure S1 shows that the estimated turn-on voltage is 1.3 V smaller for Ca (0.3 V) top contact compared to Al (1.6 V). Supplementary Fig. S1. Determination of turn-on voltage from a linear portion of the measured current-voltage curves for MWCNT-I-Ca and MWCNT-I-Al devices.

To determine the effects of geometric field enhancement at MWCNT tips on diode rectification and turn-on voltage, we tested planar Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca diodes, which were fabricated to closely match the contrast in work function and oxide thickness in the MWCNT-I-Ca devices for comparison. Planar M-I-M device geometries with glass/Ti/Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca/Al were fabricated with various areas ranging from 0.01-0.04 cm 2 by first depositing Ti (30 nm)/Au (100 nm) on ultra-smooth glass substrates using e-beam evaporation. Then 8 nm of Al 2 O 3 dielectric was deposited using ALD. Current-voltage characteristics measured on the planar devices with different active areas are shown in Fig. S2. The planar devices produced rectification ratios (~ 1.2 at ¬± 2.75 V d.c. bias) and tunnel currents (~ 1.5 ¬µA/cm 2 at 2.75 V) that are several orders of magnitude lower than the currents produced in the MWCNT-I-Ca diodes (Fig. 2b). These results suggests that reduced effective barrier resistance due to geometric field enhancement could contribute significantly to the much higher tunnel currents and asymmetry achieved in the MWCNT-I-M diodes. A simple energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 2a to illustrate the potential effects of work function contrast and field enhancement on the resistance to electron tunneling in MWCNT-I-M devices. Since the field enhancement is only expected in the forward direction, it contributes to unidirectional thinning of the tunneling barrier. This is because a single diode can be viewed roughly as a MWCNT point contact emitter against a planar surface (Fig. 1a). Supplementary Fig. S2. Current-voltage characteristics of planar M-I-M devices with glass/Ti/Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca/Al structure with an active area of 0.01 cm 2 , 0.03 cm 2 , and 0.04 cm 2 .

The electron tunneling equations from Simmons 1 are often used to fit experimental data for M-I-M diodes, however it has been shown that while these equations predict the behavior of planar structures qualitatively, the current density is often under-predicted significantly. 2,3 The current-voltage curves of CNT devices often differs somewhat from the exponential relationship between current and voltage in previous studies, 4 which is consistent with the observation in the MWCNT device data in this work. Understanding the limitations of this theory, the Simmons equations were used with the experimentally estimated turn-on voltages to determine the effective barrier thickness of an equivalent planar structure that would produce a current at these voltages. More recent work has developed numerical solutions to electron tunneling through insulators, [5][6][7] however the original analytical expressions using the WKB approximation are sufficient to examine the qualitative current-voltage behavior of planar devices. 8 The equivalent planar structures were used because CNT diode data does not fit well to classic tunneling theory because of effects including variation of curvature and electron density of states at CNT tips. 9,10 The equation for the current density under a forward applied bias for dissimilar electrodes separated by a dielectric barrier is given by Simmons: 11 (1) The current-voltage curves for the planar devices (Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca) were fitted using the above Simmons' theoretical electron tunneling equations by fitting for the effective barrier thickness, s eff . This application of Simmons' equations is also similar to previous work that changed the barrier thickness to fit the model. 8 The data and best-fit theoretical curves are shown in Fig. S4 with the experimentally measured data. It can be seen that the theoretical fittings agree well with the measured current-voltage curves for three different devices. The s eff in the planar Au-Al 2 O 3 -Ca diodes is estimated to be 2.8 nm from fitting Simmons' theory to three devices with different areas (0.01 cm 2 , 0.03 cm 2 , 0.04 cm 2 ) as shown in Fig. S4. The Au and Al 2 O 3 layers were measured with atomic force microscopy to be atomically smooth (rms roughness of 0.52 ¬± 0.06 and 0.64 ¬± 0.02 nm, respectively); therefore, it is unlikely that surface roughness contributes to field enhancement in the planar diodes, as has been observed in prior work. 8 The fact that the effective barrier thickness is thinner than the physical barrier thickness means that the tunneling equations under predict the current density, which is consistent with previous findings. 8,12 The nearly twofold reduction in s eff for MWCNT-I-M diodes compared to the equivalent planar structures presents strong evidence that field enhancement at MWCNT tips contributes to effective barrier thinning in these devices. However, the effective device field enhancement is expected to be less than that of a single CNT because of collective screening of the external field by neighboring tubes in the array. 13 Supplementary Fig. S4 S5.

The statistical uncertainty in the extracted diode characteristics is approximately ¬±10% and approximately ¬±5% in the measured voltage and current. The illuminated diode resistance and responsivity are based on applying a classical treatment to the illuminated ùêº ùëâ dc curve -the illuminated ùêº ùëâ dc curve is shifted in this case such that ùêº = 0 at ùëâ dc = 0. While this approach is only an approximation, it is useful when the range of voltages tested for dark ùêº ùëâ dc characteristics is less than ¬±‚Ñèùúî, and we find the agreement with equations (1) and ( 2) at ùëâ dc = 0 to be within ¬±30%.
