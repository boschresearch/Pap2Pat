Enhanced target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, etc. are some of the benefits that such IR detectors could provide for military and security applications.",
                        "Antennas coupled to rectifying diodes, or rectenna, are currently of research interest for their use in IR detection and solar energy conversion. Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel diodes have been investigated for use over large areas and for coupling the diodes to dipole antenna array in planar geometries. The theoretical and manufacturing aspects of square spiral nanoscale rectenna elements as electromagnetic collectors fabricated on plastic sheets has recently been explored. In another approach, transfer printing techniques that use plasma oxidized AlOx thin dielectrics were explored as a method to enable large area manufacturing of MIM diodes.",
                        "Although the concept of IR an optical rectenna was first introduced in the 1970s and was validated with limited efficiency for collection and conversion of mid IR (CO2 laser), no practical demonstration of rectification at IR or visible or solar wavelengths using rectenna has been reported. Major technical challenges include fabricating the small diode geometries required to enable operation by quantum mechanical tunneling at THz frequencies over large areas.",
                        "The emergence of nanomaterials offers significant promise in overcoming the limitations on rectenna mentioned above. In particular, CNTs have been shown to provide exceptional functional performance in nanoelectronics and sensing applications. However, numerous challenges remain both in the fundamental understanding of their transport physics and in achieving scalable and robust manufacturing methods for integrated devices.",
                        "Recently, random arrays of aligned multiwall CNTs have been shown to demonstrate antenna-like interactions with electromagnetic radiation. The multiwall CNTs exhibited both polarization and the length antenna effects that could be used in rectennas for IR and optical detection and solar harvesting applications. However, as discussed above, the ability to extract this energy efficiently through appropriate diodes remains a challenge.",

Other materials include, but are not limited to, ceramics and silicon or silicon compounds, such as silicon dioxide. In some embodiments, the surface of the support may be treated to increase adhesion with the adhesion layer. Such treatment may include, but are not limited to, the use of plasma-assisted or chemical-based surface cleaning. Another treatment includes the deposition of a metal or metal oxide coating or particles on the support. In some embodiments, the surface of the support may be treated to reduce adhesion with the carbon nanotube array.

It is suggested that the series resistance of a single CNT diode junction is at least 20 G\u03a9, which is about eight orders of magnitude higher than what has been achieved for ohmic contacts to open-ended multiwall CNTs. Nanofabrication techniques can be employed to open the ends of CNTs in the diode junctions to facilitate low resistance contacts and conduction through multiple multiwall CNT shells to quantify and understand the achievable lower limit to single junction series resistance. For example, spin-on glass can be used to infiltrate the CNT array and polishing the glass to expose open ends of the CNTs. This allows the diode junction to be formed with contact made to the inner walls of the multiwall CNTs and increases the active conduction channels. Chemical treatment in vapor or solution phase can also be used to open one or both ends of the multiwall CNTs to form low resistance contacts. Other etching processing including plasma or ion etching can be used to open one or both ends of the multiwall CNTs to form low resistance contacts. The metal contacts and/or the dielectric layer can contact multiple nanostructure walls or surfaces.",

Once removed from the growth substrate, the bottom of the CNT array in glass can be polished and or etched to expose open ends of the CNTs. This allows the bottom metal to be deposited to be in contact with multiple CNTs walls. The thickness of the top and bottom metal layers can be controlled as necessary to allow sufficient optical transparency for rectenna testing. Also, metals with high (e.g., Au) and low (e.g., Al or Ca) work functions can be chosen to optimize the barrier heights with the oxide dielectric layer.",

Nitrogen doping can be accomplished in-situ by adjusting the concentration of nitrogen in the chamber during CNT growth. Boron doping can be accomplished in a different plasma chamber after CNT growth.",

By repeating the surface reactions, oxide (e.g., alumina) growth is extremely linear with the number of AB cycles. In air, water vapor is adsorbed to most of the surfaces, forming hydroxyl groups.

These solar cells can be used for broadband solar-to-electric and solar-to-heat energy conversion. The devices described herein could supplement or supplant current concentrated solar power (CSP) heat absorbers. Rectenna convert alternative current (AC) solar electromagnetic waves into direct current (DC) power by receiving them in an antenna and rectifying the current in a diode. This process is fundamentally different from solar energy conversion in semiconductors, which is known to degrade significantly at elevated temperatures. Rectification at solar frequencies, however, requires extremely low diode capacitance, which is difficult to achieve with existing fabrication approaches. In contrast, the devices described herein exhibit low capacitance in diode junction areas defined by the diameter of a multiwall CNT. Diodes in the CNT rectenna exhibited no significant change in performance at moderate elevated temperatures (e.g., 5\u00b0 C.-77\u00b0 C.) and over repeated cycles (e.g., excellent operational stability). The devices exhibit significant asymmetry between the forward (+V) and reverse (\u2212V) current. This enables high rectification ratios, which are required for efficient rectenna energy conversion. They also benefit from the low intrinsic resistance of CNTs and field enhancement at CNT tips. Energy conversion efficiency is about 0.00002% for the current case of diode resistance equal to 20 G\u03a9, but, because efficiency scales as the inverse of diode resistance, could be increased to an efficiency of 40% by reducing the diode resistance to 10 k\u03a9, which is an achievable level.",

A large increase in current density for a given applied bias in the J-V curves under solar illumination demonstrates that CNT rectenna devices described herein operate as photodetectors at room temperature and at solar frequencies. The observation of a measurable photo current and photo voltage under solar illumination at zero bias also suggests that the architecture is an energy-harvesting device in addition to a photodetector. This data was obtained using a low transparency top metal contact, without matching the length of the antenna to the incident EM wavelengths. It was observed that lowering the barrier height at the oxide/top metal interface (e.g., Ca electrode devices) improves the rectification/asymmetry of the diode in comparison to the devices with higher barrier height at the insulator/top electrode interface (e.g., Al electrode devices).",

This value is several orders of magnitude lower than the currents required to produce significant Joule heating in prior art MWCNTs. Currents higher than this estimated minimum could have been produced considering that some MWCNTs can be uprooted during growth, which would decrease the number density of active diode junctions. However, such changes are expected to within an order of magnitude of the original number density based on images taken at the end of the processing steps.",

The maximum tunnel currents produced by the MWCNT-O-M vertical diode arrays in this study (\u02dc78 mA or 7,800 mA/cm2) are several orders of magnitude higher at significantly lower voltages. Moreover, the high temperatures required for direct CNT growth on thin oxide barriers can cause the catalyst metal to diffuse into the oxide making device shorts and inconsistent performance very likely.",

The higher rectification and lower turn-on voltage (FIG. 4) using Ca (\u02dc10.5 and 0.3 V, respectively) versus Al (\u02dc2 and 1.6 V, respectively) is attributed to the \u02dc1.4 eV lower work function of Ca. Similar trends in the J-V characteristics were observed when the work function of the MWCNTs (bottom electrode) was different.",

Diode rectification and turn-on voltage could also be affected by geometric field enhancement at MWCNT tips. Therefore, planar Au\u2014Al2O3\u2014Ca diodes, which were designed to closely match the contrast in work function and oxide thickness in the MWCNT-O-Ca devices, were tested for comparison (FIG. 5). The planar devices yielded rectification ratios (\u02dc1.2 at \u00b12.75 V DC bias) and tunnel currents \u02dc1.5 \u03bcA/cm2 at 2.75 V) that are several orders of magnitude lower than the currents produced in the MWCNT-O-Ca diodes (FIG. 3a). These results suggests that reduced effective barrier resistance due to geometric field enhancement could contribute significantly to the much higher tunnel currents and asymmetry achieved in the MWCNT-O-M diodes. A simple energy level diagram is shown in FIG. 3b to illustrate the potential effects of work function contrast and field enhancement on the resistance to electron tunneling in MWCNT-O-Ca devices. Since the field enhancement is only expected in the forward direction, it contributes to unidirectional thinning of the tunneling barrier. This is because a single diode can be viewed roughly as a MWCNT point contact emitter against a planar surface.",
                                "The electron tunneling equations from Simmons are often used to fit experimental data for M-O-M diodes. However, it has been shown that while these equations predict the behavior of planar structures qualitatively, the current density is often under-predicted significantly. The J-V curves of CNT devices often differs somewhat from the exponential relationship between current and voltage in previous studies, which is consistent with the observation in the MWCNT device data described herein. Understanding the limitations of this theory, the Simmons equations were used to demonstrate that the difference in turn-on voltages of the MWCNT-O-Al and MWCNT-O-Ca devices can be attributed to the difference in work function of Al and Ca, \u02dc1.4 eV (FIG. 3c), as concluded above from the experimental data. Based upon the turn-on voltage, the MWCNT-O-Ca and MWCNT-O-Al devices with 8 nm of deposited oxide are found to have identical effective tunneling barrier thicknesses of 1.5 nm (from FIG. 3c), which are nearly twofold smaller than the thicknesses in equivalent planar devices (2.8 nm from FIG. 6). These results support the conclusion that there is field enhancement in the MWCNT devices contributing to higher current density.",
                                "The measured capacitances (C) based on the apparent device area (0.1 cm2) of MWCNT-O-M diode arrays with different oxide thicknesses are shown in FIG. 7a to be nearly constant in the frequency range of our measurement capabilities (up to 106 Hz). The results do not show the inverse thickness relation of a conventional parallel plate capacitor because the permittivity of nanoscale oxide insulators can decrease with thickness. Considering the much smaller real or active device area (0.5\u00d710-3 cm2) estimated from number density of MWCNTs observed in SEM (\u02dc1010/cm2) and the MWCNT diameter (8 nm), specific capacitances of approximately 3.4 \u03bcg/cm2 or approximately 2 attofarads per MWCNT junction, and a dielectric constant (e) of 3.8 are extracted from FIG. 7a for the MWCNT-O-M arrays fabricated with 8 nm Al2O3. Ana of 5.14 is extracted from measurements on equivalent planar devices (FIG. 8). Considering the large uncertainty in determining the active MWCNT-O-M diode areas based on counting MWCNTs in SEM, the \u03b5 of both MWCNT and planar diodes agree with reported values for the dielectric constant of ALD Al2O3 in this thickness range.",
                                "The impedance of the MWCNT-O-M diode arrays with 8 and 15 nm of Al2O3 were measured assuming a parallel combination of capacitive reactance (Xc) and resistance (RD) (FIG. 7b). At low frequencies, Xc is higher for the devices with 15 nm oxides as expected. At frequencies above approximately 104 Hz both oxide thicknesses produce similar magnitudes of low RD and Xc, which correspond to impedance values of 2-106 at 106 Hz and 20 mVrms. The real part of impedance is 2-714 \u03a9 at this frequency, which is in agreement with the range of DC resistances for Ca and Al devices at zero bias 307-423 \u03a9 (defined as (A\u00b7dJ/dV)\u0302(\u22121) at Vbias\u22480). Considering the number density of MWCNTs in the arrays, the range of single junction resistances is 20-7140 G\u03a9. These resistances include the intrinsic resistance of the oxide-coated MWCNT and contact resistances, and the resistance of the oxide barrier, which increases exponentially with the oxide thickness. The single junction resistances are 4-7 orders of magnitude larger than what is typically observed for MWCNTs and their contacts so these high resistances can most likely be attributed to the relatively thick oxide tunnel barriers at zero or low bias.",
                                "Several MWCNT-O-M devices with areas of 0.0025, 0.01, and 0.1 cm2 were fabricated to demonstrate scaling (FIG. 9a). Rectification ratios in the devices with Ca (10-12 @ \u00b12 V) and Al (2.5 @ \u00b12 V) top electrodes at 0.1 cm2 (FIG. 9b) agree with theoretical expectations and the trends displayed in the devices with smaller areas. However, the total current did not increase with area as expected, possibly because of reduced contact between MWCNTs and the top electrode that results from increased non-uniformity of MWCNT heights in arrays grown over larger areas.",
                                "Arrays with qualitatively straighter and less entangled MWCNTs produced MWCNT-O-M (Al) diodes with better rectifying behavior (ratio of 60 at 3 V) and asymmetry than all other devices (FIG. 10a). However, tunnel currents are significantly lower in these devices because the diameter of MWCNTs is nearly twice as large, which likely reduces electric field enhancement at the tips. The reasons for the better rectification in the devices with straighter MWCNTs are not clear, but it highlights the potential significance of exercising greater control over array morphology. The J-V characteristics of several MWCNT-O-M devices were virtually unchanged from 5 to 77\u00b0 C. (FIG. 10b), indicating that they do not behave as semiconductor based diodes or semiconducting CNT Schottky junctions, which have strong temperature dependence and are limited by their capacitance to operational frequencies below those that can be achieved by true quantum tunnel diodes.",
                                "To demonstrate operation at ultrahigh frequency, rectenna devices were fabricated using the MWCNT-O-M vertical tunnel diode arrays and semitransparent top metal electrodes\u201420 nm Ca capped with 10 nm Al. Rectenna devices have yet to be demonstrated at solar frequencies because of limits on diode performance. It was observed that the diodes based on MWCNTs have the nanoscale dimensions and rectification performance required to overcome these limits. Current-voltage characteristics of the MWCNT-O-M rectenna array in dark, and under illumination with 1064 nm (\u02dc281 THz) laser are shown in FIG. 11a. The device was irradiated from the top at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with respect to the MWCNT alignment. This irradiation increased the nonlinearity of the MWCNT-O-M diode response. Switching the IR laser on and off produced a fast instantaneous within the limits of our measurement sensitivity\u2014current response at zero bias as shown in FIG. 11b. The open circuit voltage was measured as a function of the laser polarization angle and showed clear antenna effects on the rectified voltage (FIG. 11c). The data shows that the MWCNT-O-M diodes can operate at frequencies of at least 281 THz, which is well within the solar spectrum. Data for illumination at 532 nm is shown in FIG. 12. Data for illumination by AM1.5 0.01 W/cm2 solar light for different devices in show in FIGS. 13 and 14. The arrays produce short circuit current densities greater than 0.1 \u03bcA/cm2 or 1 \u03bcA/cm2 when illuminated by laser wavelengths of 1064 nm or 532 nm, or when illuminated by AM1.5 0.01 W/cm2 solar light."
