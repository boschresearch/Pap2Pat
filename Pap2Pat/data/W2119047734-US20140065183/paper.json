    "title": "A Quadruple Knockout of lasIR and rhlIR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 That Retains Wild-Type Twitching Motility Has Equivalent Infectivity and Persistence to PAO1 in a Mouse Model of Lung Infection",
    "date": "2013-04-10",
    "abstract": "It has been widely reported that quorum-sensing incapable strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are less virulent than wild type strains. However, quorum sensing mutants of P. aeruginosa have been shown to develop other spontaneous mutations under prolonged culture conditions, and one of the phenotypes of P. aeruginosa that is frequently affected by this phenomenon is type IV pili-dependent motility, referred to as twitching motility. As twitching motility has been reported to be important for adhesion and colonisation, we aimed to generate a quorum-sensing knockout for which the heritage was recorded and the virulence factor production in areas unrelated to quorum sensing was known to be intact. We created a lasIRrhlIR quadruple knockout in PAO1 using a published technique that allows for the deletion of antibiotic resistance cartridges following mutagenesis, to create an unmarked QS knockout of PAO1, thereby avoiding the need for use of antibiotics in culturing, which can have subtle effects on bacterial phenotype. We phenotyped this mutant demonstrating that it produced reduced levels of protease and elastase, barely detectable levels of pyoverdin and undetectable levels of the quorum sensing signal molecules N-3-oxododecanoly-L-homoserine lactone and N-butyryl homoserine lactone, but retained full twitching motility. We then used a mouse model of acute lung infection with P. aeruginosa to demonstrate that the lasIRrhlIR knockout strain showed equal persistence to wild type parental PAO1, induced equal or greater neutrophil infiltration to the lungs, and induced similar levels of expression of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs and similar antibody responses, both in terms of magnitude and isotype. Our results suggest, in contrast to previous reports, that lack of quorum sensing alone does not significantly affect the immunogenicity, infectiveness and persistence of P. aeruginosa in a mouse model of acute lung infection.",

                "The role of quorum sensing (QS) and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biology is clear, and previous reports have suggested that knocking out QS systems in P. aeruginosa results in decreased virulence in animal models of infection [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] and has impacts on bacterial growth rate in culture. The deletion of both the synthase genes and the responder genes for both 3-oxo-N-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) and the other principal homoserine lactone QS signal produced by P. aeruginosa, N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4HSL) should result in a quadruple knockout that will not respond to or produce 3OC12HSL or C4HSL. Previously reported lasI/rhlI knockouts including PAO1-JP2 have been reported to be less virulent than wild type P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a range of animal models [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. However, QS mutants of P. aeruginosa have been shown to develop spontaneous mutations under prolonged culture conditions [12], [13], and one of the phenotypes of P. aeruginosa that is frequently affected by this phenomenon is type IV pili-dependent motility, referred to as twitching motility [12]. In fact, twitching motility was originally reported to be controlled by QS [14] but was later confirmed to be independently regulated [15]. Interestingly, JP-2 has been reported to be incapable of twitching motility [14] which suggests that this strain is likely to contain secondary mutations in a gene (or genes) required for twitching motility. It has been shown that, unlike the PAO1 parental strain, a PAO1 mutant with defective pili is unable to bind to respiratory epithelial cells and cannot induce production of the proinflammatory and neutrophil-recruiting chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 [16]. It has also been reported in many studies that type-IV pili are integral for adherence to and colonization of mucosal surfaces (reviewed in Hahn et al. [17]). It is therefore important that twitching motility remains intact in any QS knockout P. aeruginosa used for in vivo infection studies assessing the role of QS in bacterial infectivity and persistence.",
                "Because of the inherent and spontaneous mutations that occur during standard laboratory subculturing of P. aeruginosa, we created a lasIRrhlIR knockout in a strain for which the heritage was recorded and the virulence factor production in areas unrelated to QS was known to be intact. We used a technique described by Hoang et al. [18], which allows for the deletion of antibiotic resistance cartridges following mutagenesis, to create an unmarked QS knockout of PAO1. Such a knockout strain has two benefits: firstly an unmarked knockout can be further genetically modified without the need for multiple resistance cassettes and secondly, it has been found that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can profoundly influence the phenotype of P. aeruginosa [19], [20], [21]. A knockout strain that does not require antibiotic selection for maintenance of mutation would allow the comparison of QS knockout strains to isogenic wild-type bacteria without any possibility of phenotypic changes being generated in the bacteria because of the presence of antibiotics in the culture medium.",
                "After creation of the quadruple lasIRrhlIR knockout, we tested it in a mouse model of P. aeruginosa lung infection to compare the course of infection with that of the parental PAO1. We found that the knockout showed equal persistence, induced comparable or greater inflammation, and resulted in identical antibody responses in terms of magnitude and immunoglobulin isotype to parental PAO1."

                        "Unmarked deletion mutants of PAO1 were constructed using the Flp-FRT recombination system for site specific excision of chromosomal sequences described [18]. Briefly, 1 kb sections that flanked the lasIR and rhlIR region(s) to be deleted from PAO1 chromosomal DNA were PCR amplified and cloned into pGEMTeasy and sequenced to ensure that no mutations in these flanking regions had been introduced by PCR. The upstream and downstream flanking regions of the las or rhl regions were ligated and then cloned into pOK12 (creating pJL005 and pJL006 respectively) and the FRT/TetR cassette from pCBW108 cloned into the internal SacI site resulting in pOK12 constructs pJL007 and pJL008 containing the flanking regions of lasIR or rhlIR regions separated by the FRT::TetR cassette. The resultant clones were then digested with SpeI and cloned into the suicide vector pRIC380. This vector carries the genes sacBR, which promote sensitivity to sucrose, and oriT which enables conjugal transfer. The resultant clones were transformed into the E. coli donor strain S17-1 in preparation for mating with P. aeruginosa PAO1. Following conjugation, the transconjugants were plated onto LBA without sodium chloride and supplemented with 5% sucrose and containing tetracycline to select for colonies in which the plasmid had excised while leaving the homologously recombined lasIR::TetR or rhlIR::TetR alleles in the chromosome. The TetR gene was then excised using the pFLP2 plasmid that expresses the Flp recombinase as described previously [18] creating P. aeruginosa strains with the lasIR or rhlIR regions deleted and replaced with an FRT sequence. Allelic exchange deletion mutants were confirmed by both PCR and Southern hybridization of isolated chromosomal DNA. A list of all plasmids used in this study is given in Table 1 and all primers used are listed in Table 2."

Primer sequences for mouse keratinocyte cytokine (KC) (analogue of human IL-8) (forward 5\u2032\u2013GCTGGGATTCACCTCAAGAA\u20133\u2032, reverse 5\u2032\u2013AGGTGCCATCAGAGCAGTCT\u20133\u2032) were designed from GenBank sequences using Primer 3-web version 0.3.0 [34]. Primer pairs were checked for reaction efficiency using triplicate serial dilutions of template cDNA with efficiency calculated as described in Pfaffl, 2001 [35]. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the Platinum\u00aeSYBR\u00aeGreen qPCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen). Each qPCR reaction contained 5 \u00b5L of cDNA diluted 1\u22365\u20131\u223610 with DEPC-treated H2O, and final primer concentrations of 300 nM. The reactions were performed on a RotorGene 3000\u00ae (Corbett Life Science) with an initial incubation of 50\u00b0C for 10 min then 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 reaction cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and acquiring fluorescence at 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. All products underwent melt curve analysis. Replicates showing errors were omitted from further analysis. The average of the technical replicates was used to determine the ratio of the target to the reference genes (\u03b2-actin and GAPDH) and corrected for the primer efficiency as described by Pfaffl [35]. Interassay variation was calculated by comparing the Ct values of a standard incorporated into all qPCR reactions. A coefficient of variation was calculated using PRISM\u00ae v.5 software (Graph Pad Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA) and values below 10% deemed to be acceptable."

Because of the hierarchical nature of the las and rhl quorum sensing systems the PAO1\u0394rhlIR mutant was created first as a lasIR knockout would also be deficient in many of the phenotypes that we used to confirm the rhlIR knockout.",

As expected, our PAO1\u0394rhlIR mutant produced reduced levels of elastase (Fig. 1a) and protease (Fig. 1b) relative to PAO1, did not produce rhamnolipid (Fig. 1e), produced barely detectable levels of pyocyanin (Fig. 1c), and retained wild-type twitching motility (Fig. 1d).",

The bacterial numbers recovered from lung tissue and BAL at each time point are shown in Fig. 3, and indicate that at each time point there were no significant differences between wild type PAO1 and the PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR mutant, although there was a trend to recovery of higher numbers of PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR than PAO1 at 4 h and 24 h.

The only significant differences between mice inoculated with PAO1 and PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR were in total white cells and neutrophils at 4 h and 24 h post infection, where neutrophil numbers (and hence total white cell counts) were significantly higher in mice infected with PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR (p<0.01, unpaired t test).",

                "The literature contains numerous examples of animal models of P. aeruginosa infection. In many of these, a comparison of a wild type (usually PAO1) and a variety of QS-deficient strains suggest that QS-controlled virulence factors are important in the pathogenesis of infection, and that most QS mutants are less virulent than wild type P. aeruginosa. It is unquestionable that QS controlled biofilm formation and virulence factor production plays an important role in bacterial virulence, particularly in clinical settings such as cystic fibrosis (CF) (e.g. [7]). However, because many QS mutants are known to acquire other mutations, particularly in twitching motility, which could affect infection and dissemination, we decided to create a rigorously designed quadruple knockout, and further minimize any chance of other mutations arising by limiting its culturing. Such a knockout would allow the separation of effects of bacterial adherence and infectivity from the effects of QS-controlled virulence.",
                "Creation of the PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR was a multi-step process. A PAO1\u0394rhlIR mutant was created first because of the hierarchical nature of the las and rhl quorum sensing systems: a lasIR knockout would be deficient in many of the phenotypes used to confirm a rhlIR knockout, making the phenotypic confirmation of a rhlIR knockout on a PAO1\u0394lasIR background more difficult. However, creating the rhlIR knockout first enabled us to confirm that its phenotype was as expected, with loss of pyocyanin production being the key phenotype change. The deletion of the lasI and lasR genes also resulted in the deletion of rsaL, but we predicted that an rsaL deletion would not affect the mutant significantly because its product is a lasI repressor, and this was supported by the phenotypic studies on the PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR and PAO1\u0394lasIR mutants generated. The characteristics of the PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR knockouts clearly demonstrate that they are unable to produce a number of key QS-regulated virulence factors, and cannot respond to exogenous AHLs, but that they retain full twitching capability.",
                "The results of the studies in the mouse model of lung infection suggest that there is no significant difference between the persistence of PAO1 and PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR in mouse lungs, or in their ability to induce an inflammatory response in the host, although there is a suggestion from the neutrophil counts that PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR actually induces a stronger inflammatory infiltrate than the parental PAO1, and the trend to higher bacterial numbers recovered in PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR infected mice is consistent with the slightly faster growth rate of this strain (results not shown). Wu et al. also observed a stronger inflammatory response to a PAO1 lasIrhlI knockout strain (PAO1-JP2) in a rat model, but unlike in our study, this was accompanied by a more rapid clearance of bacteria [11]. However, as PAO1-JP2 is known to be deficient in twitching motility [14], this is likely to affect its ability to colonise lungs and hence its ability to persist. However, other studies in rats and mice have also suggested that quorum sensing-defective mutants are cleared more effectively than wild type bacteria [11], [36]. For example, a study using a neonatal BALB/c model of infection reported that a PAO1\u0394lasR mutant was virtually avirulent, causing no mortality, no evidence of lung pathology and only 15% of mice showed evidence of bacterial replication in vivo [37], although the authors found that PAO1\u0394lasR were still recovered in the lungs 24 h post infection in numbers similar to PAO1, indicating that although the bacteria could persist they did not cause pathology [37]. In our study, the bacterial numbers in PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR-infected and wild type PAO1-infected mice were similar at each time point, with low numbers persisting out to at least 10 days after infection. Analysis of the cytokine mRNA in the lungs indicates that there is little difference in the ability of the two strains to stimulate effective proinflammatory cytokine responses, although analysis of the PMN recruitment to the lung indicates that PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR is more effective at stimulating innate immunity.",
                "An explanation for some of the differences between our results and those of others may be that, although PAO1 is the laboratory standard for P. aeruginosa, there is a great deal of genetic diversity between laboratories in the PAO1 strains used [13]. For example, twitching motility is one of the phenotypes commonly lost during ongoing laboratory culture, because of the development of point mutations in other regulators such as vfr [12]. For example, the PAO1 lasIrhlI knockout strain (PAO1-JP2) used in many studies has been reported to lack twitching motility [14] and this can reduce the ability of the bacteria to colonize mammalian epithelia. Thus, some of the reported reduced virulence of QS mutant P. aeruginosa may be the consequence of impaired colonization by twitching-deficient bacteria. Care was taken in the creation of the PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR mutant used in this study to ensure that such secondary mutations had not occurred, increasing confidence that the results from this study were in fact a reflection of the differences in quorum sensing ability of PAO1\u0394lasIRrhIR and wild type PAO1, and not of other mutations in PAO1.",
                "High antibody titres against P. aeruginosa have been associated with decreases in lung function and poorer outcomes of infection [38], [39]. There were detectable titres of anti-P. aeruginosa IgM antibodies at 10 days post lung infection in the acute infection model, but no detectable IgG1 or IgG2a, and no difference between PAO1-infected mice and those infected with PAO1\u0394lasIRrhIR (results not shown). To evaluate later immune responses, we generated a more chronic infection by giving mice P. aeruginosa in an agar slurry, which delays bacterial clearance, and collecting serum at day 22 after an acute bacterial challenge on day 21. P. aeruginosa-specific IgM, IgG1 and IgG2a were all easily detectable at this time point, but there was no difference in the titers of any of the isotypes between PAO1\u0394lasIRrhlIR-infected and PAO1-infected mice. This is in contrast to a previous report using a rat model of infection suggesting that the IgG1 response was higher in rats infected with PAO1 compared with rats infected with a QS signal-deficient mutant (PAO1\u0394lasIrhlI) [40]. As IgG1 is associated with prohumoral Th2 type responses in mice, this implied that QS-deficient mutants generated a more Th2-biased response, but we saw no such difference. The difference between our results and those reported by Wu et al. could be due to species variation, because of the differences in persistence between PAO1 and PAO1\u0394lasIrhlI observed in Wu et al.\u2019s study, where the mutant was cleared more effectively than the wild type, or could be related to differences in the bacterial strains other than those defined.",
                "The mouse model used in this study was an acute lung infection, and our results do not exclude the likelihood that QS-mediated induction of biofilm formation and virulence factor production play important roles in chronic infections. It would be of interest to repeat these studies in models of chronic infection, particularly immune deficiency or cystic fibrosis, which in humans, results in increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection. It remains entirely possible that QS mutants may be less virulent in such situations than wild type P. aeruginosa, for a combination of reasons related to both defects in biofilm formation and virulence factor production and to host factors and the characteristics of the inflammatory and immune responses to infection, which are known to be aberrant in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) [41]. In this context, although it is clear that P. aeruginosa exists in biofilms in CF lung [42], [43] and the bacterial populations present in CF lung are heterogeneous and always include some QS-competent bacteria [42], it is relevant to note that it has been reported that QS-deficient mutants arise spontaneously after some years in people with CF with chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection [7]. The most frequently observed mutation in the genes of the QS systems is in lasR \u00b8 which could suggest that while QS systems are important for initiating and maintaining chronic infection, \u201csocial cheating\u201d by subpopulations of QS-deficient P. aeruginosa could confer a survival advantage in the environment of the chronically-infected and damaged CF lung.",
                "In conclusion, our results suggest that careful control of culture and propagation of QS deficient PAO1 derivatives to prevent additional mutations and the loss of such important characteristics as twitching motility may eliminate a significant proportion of the previously observed differences in infectivity and persistence of QS-deficient bacteria and wild-type P. aeruginosa in animal models, and allow a more precise evaluation of the importance of QS and QS-regulated gene expression in bacterial virulence and pathogenesis of infection."
