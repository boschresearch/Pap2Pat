                        "The current invention was developed from the concept that blocking quorum sensing signal molecules could limit the ability of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms and inhibit a range of quorum-sensing dependent virulence factors. The approach to block QSSM was to develop an immunogenic AHL which can be used as a therapeutic or prophylactic vaccine. The approach was to conjugate AHL with the immunogenic P aeruginosa protein KatA. KatA is a P aeruginosa catalase protein that decomposes hydrogen peroxide released from phagocytes (Thomas L D, Dunkley M L, Moore R, Reynolds S, Bastin D A, Kyd J M, et al. Catalase immunization from Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhances bacterial clearance in the rat lung. Vaccine 2001; 19:348-57). The strategy was to develop an immune response to AHL to reduce the ability of P aeruginosa to form biofilms, while at the same time induce an immune response to the conjugated protein KatA, to neutralize the bacterial catalase functions and make P aeruginosa more susceptible to host immune defences.",

Solutions of both N-hydroxysuccininimide (NHS) in DMF (100 mg/mL) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in 100 mM carbonate buffer (100 mg/mL), pH 8.2 were added to the dissolved hapten and mixed well. The solution was incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. KatA was diluted to a concentration of 1.89 mg/mL in 100 mM carbonate buffer, pH 8.2. The activated carboxyl-OdDHL was added to the protein solution and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. Purification of the conjugate was carried out against carbonate buffer by dialysis cassettes.
