Such glaciogenic seeding is performed in terms of securing water resources and divided into airborne experiments and ground experiments.",
                                "Silver iodide, that is, a seeding material, is colorless and odorless, and thus it is difficult to check where the seeding material has been spread by a naked eye.

In airborne experiments, pieces of information about seeding for the execution of experiments chiefly depend on a weather condition. Accordingly, it is necessary to check the path and seeding effect of a seeding material in advance by exchanging a flight path and the amount of seeding in advance using a forecast field and performing numerical simulations.",

                        "First, a weather factor analysis unit analyzes the weather factors of an experiment area on which airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments are to be performed at step S110.",
                        "In this case, the weather factor analysis unit may analyze the velocity of the wind, the direction of the wind, temperature and humidity, that is, the weather factors of the experiment area on which airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments are to be performed using a vertical time-series diagram of weather center forecast data.",
                        "More specifically, the weather factor analysis unit may analyze whether the inflow of clouds is present or not and weather factors (e.g., the velocity of the wind, the direction of the wind, temperature and humidity) in a target area on which airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments are to be performed, for example, the Daegwallyeong district where Yongpyong ski resorts is located using the vertical time-series diagram of the weather center forecast data (UMRDAPS) shown in FIG. 2.",
                        "Thereafter, an airborne experiment possibility determination unit determines whether airborne experiments are possible or not based on the direction of the wind, the velocity of the wind, temperature and humidity of the target area at step S120.",
                        "More specifically, the airborne experiment possibility determination unit determines whether an airborne experiment is possible or not based on forecast data. In this case, a condition on the determination may be determined to be possible if all of conditions are satisfied in a condition table for determining whether an airborne experiment is possible or not in FIG. 3. For example, if it is expected that airborne experiments are possible because the velocity of the wind of 10 m/s or less, \u22125\u00b0 C. or less and humidity of 80% or more are satisfied in the target area, a next step may be performed. If not, experiments may be determined to be not performed.",
                        "Thereafter, a seeding information determination unit determines seeding information by taking into consideration the direction of the wind and the velocity of the wind at step S130.",

                        "More specifically, as shown in FIG. 4 showing a conceptual diagram for setting a seeding line for 8 bearings, the seeding line is calculated by calculating a distance S to a target point based on 8 bearings (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west and northwest). The distance S is calculated by Equation 1 below.",

The response time refers to the time that is taken for the seeding material to enter the clouds and to become snow through an ice crystal uncleation process.",
                        "For example, assuming that the response time is 30 minutes, the response time is 1800 s, that is, 30 minutes\u00d760. Assuming that the average velocity of the wind is 5 m/s, S=5 m/s\u00d71800 s=9000 m=9 km.",

                        "For example, the numerical simulation execution unit selects 6 hours anterior and posterior to a determined seeding time as a simulation time, calculates an input field and a boundary field using the weather forecast data (e.g., UM LDAPS) on the basis of the seeding line, and generates a file \u201cair.seed.txt\u201d, that is, information about a point, time and an altitude regarding the seeding information by inputting a seeding start point S1 (latitude, longitude), a seeding end point S2 (latitude, longitude), a seeding start time, a seeding termination time and the amount of seeding, that is, pieces of information about seeding by executing aircraft.csh shell.",
                        "In this case, first, SEED numerical experiments (glaciogenic seeding experiments) are performed with 1 km resolution and NOSEED experiments (criterion experiments or non-seeding experiments) are performed at the same time. FIG. 5 is a diagram showing a concept regarding such numerical experiments.",
                        "Thereafter, an experiment calculation unit displays and calculates a seeding material spread and distribution field using the results of the numerical simulations, displays a precipitation increment and a region, and calculates areas at steps S220 and S230.",
                        "More specifically, the experiment calculation unit displays and calculates the seeding material spread and distribution field through the results of the SEED numerical experiments (glaciogenic seeding experiments). FIG. 6 shows a distribution of a spread seeding material based on the results of the SEED numerical experiments. The spread diagram of FIG. 6 shows an area regarding whether the seeding material reaches a target point after several minutes from a seeding start time.",
                        "Furthermore, the experiment calculation unit may display a precipitation increment and a region attributable to the experiments based on a difference between the amount of precipitation in the SEED numerical experiments and the amount of precipitation in the NOSEED numerical experiments, and may calculate areas, as shown in FIG. 7. In this case, the area is calculated by reading a SEED experiment file and a NOSEED experiment file, calculating a difference (SEED and NOSEED) between the accumulated amounts of precipitation in about 3 hours after the seeding is terminated, and calculating the number of pixels whose value is 0.1 mm or more. One pixel is 1 km\u03022. Accordingly, the number of pixels in which a precipitation increase has occurred indicates an area.",
                        "Thereafter, a seeding effect determination unit determines whether a seeding effect is present or not using the displayed and calculated results at step S300.",
                        "In this case, the seeding effect determination unit may determine whether a seeding effect is present or not based on whether the seeding material has reached the target area or not and a precipitation increment and a precipitation increase area attributable to the seeding using the displayed and calculated results.",
                        "For example, a criterion for determining whether a seeding effect is present or not may include whether a seeding material has reached the target area or not and a precipitation increase of 0.1 mm or more and a precipitation increase area of 100 km2 or more attributable to the seeding. In this case, the criteria, that is, the numerical values of the precipitation increase of 0.1 mm and the area of 100 km2, may be changed.",
                        "Experiments may be performed or not based on the results of the determination of whether a seeding effect is present or not.",
                        "That is, if it is determined that a seeding effect is not present, experiments are determined to be not performed at step S310. If it is determined that a seeding effect is present, experiments are determined to be performed at step S320.",
                        "As described above, in the method for determining whether to perform airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments through numerical simulations in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a seeding line, a seeing period, the amount of seeding and a seeding altitude are calculated by taking into consideration an average direction and velocity of the wind when airborne experiments are performed based on a weather center detailed forecast field. The spread of a seeding material and a distribution (i.e., a target area) of glaciogenic seeding attributable to the seeding are checked through simulations using a numerical model. Accordingly, whether to perform experiments can be determined, and a rate of success of corresponding airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments can be improved.",
                        "FIG. 8 is a diagram showing the configuration of a system for determining whether to perform airborne glaciogenic seeding experiments through numerical simulations in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.",
