                        "Most flow and mass cytometry applications in biomedical studies are based on comparisons between/among control and test samples. Dissimilarities between/among samples may be due to drug treatment regime, progression of disease, response to therapies, etc. To study these dissimilarities across samples, the populations of cells in each sample may be clustered to reveal phenotypically distinct cell subsets that can then be matched and compared between samples. Despite the widespread use of flow and mass cytometry to evaluate outcomes in the laboratory and the clinic, current analysis methods for sample comparison and matching between samples still require further development to fully accommodate real-world flow/mass cytometry data. At present, methods for samples comparison and matching are either computationally expensive and affected by the curse of dimensionality or fail in the presence of small changes due to instrument noise, calibration, etc., that are very common in flow cytometry and similar type of data as explained below.",
                        "Traditionally cluster analysis of flow cytometry data has been done by manual gating of the data, which has proved effective in a gross sense but is both subjective and extremely laborious, particularly with current high-dimensional (Hi-D) (e.g., >6 measured parameters) data sets. The need to facilitate these analyses, and make them more accurate, has motivated development of automated or semiautomatic clustering and cluster matching methods for Hi-D flow and mass cytometry data.",
                        "Both of these tasks (cluster identification and cluster matching) are highly challenging because they are subject to the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d, a well-known statistical problem for Hi-D data that compromises both statistical validity and computational performance as described in Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R. & Friedman, J. Local methods in high dimensions in The elements of statistical learning. 22-27 (Springer-Verlag, 2009).",
                        "Existing methods address the cluster matching problem in two different ways, both of which have limitations. The first way is to cluster one sample at a time and align and match the cell subsets (clusters) present in multiple samples post clustering (e.g., Pyne, S. et al. Automated high-dimensional flow cytometric data analysis. Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA. 106, 8519-8524 (2009) (hereafter \u201cPyne et al., Proc. Natl Acad Sci, 2009\u201d)). This conventional approach allows fast computational implementations in low dimensions. However, it can fail if the locations of the populations (clusters) significantly vary from sample to sample, or if populations disappear or appear between samples. When clustering is performed in Hi-D settings, this approach may also be compromised by the curse of dimensionality.",
                        "The second type of approach (e.g., see Lee, S. et al. Modeling of inter-sample variation in flow cytometric data with the joint clustering and matching procedure. Cytometry A. 89(1), 30-43 (2016) (hereafter \u201cLee et al., Cytometry part A, 2016\u201d); Cron, A. et al. Hierarchical modeling for rare event detection and cell subset alignment across flow cytometry samples. PLoS Comput Biol. 9(7), e1003130 (2013) (hereafter \u201cCron et al., PLoS Comput Biol, 2013\u201d); and Dundar, M. et al. A non-parametric Bayesian model for joint cell clustering and cluster matching: identification of anomalous sample phenotypes with random effects. BMC Bioinformatics. 15, 314 (2014) (hereafter \u201cDundar et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2014\u201d)) alleviates some of these problems by creating a Hi-D template of meta-clusters (distinct biologically relevant cell types) in which all sample data are pooled, simultaneously clustered, and then matched. With these methods, multiple samples are treated as different realizations of a single underlying model reflecting the biological reality.",
                        "Apart from being computationally expensive, the majority of methods that belong to this category identify clusters by fitting mathematical models to datasets. The feasibility of fitting in these case; however, is dramatically affected by the curse of dimensionality, because the number of combinations of possible parameters to be considered increases dramatically as the number of dimensions increases above three or four.",
                        "Thus, although the existing methods offer solutions to some aspects of the cluster-matching problem, they still do not fully accommodate real-world flow/mass cytometry data.",
                        "Conventional systems and methods also have drawbacks when being used for sequential gating of high dimensional flow data. Some conventional analysis applications used for sequential gating of Hi-D flow data include tools providing progressive two-dimensional (2D) views of the Hi-D flow data. However, conventional analysis applications do not provide the user with guidance for deciding which pair of reagents/markers may be a good candidate for the next recursive analysis round. Instead, it leaves these choices up to the user, who often must resort to trial and error in making these analysis choices, a frustrating process when a large number of reagents and/or fluorescence detectors are used to distinguish individual subsets.",
                        "Thus, there is a need for a systems and methods directed to improved cluster matching and user guidance for sequential gating of flow data, especially Hi-D flow data."

In some embodiments, an item refers to an individual particle (e.g., including a cell or a group of cells), which is subjected to measurements in a flow cytometry system to produce multidimensional data. Examples of resulting measured data for the item, include, but are not limited to optical scatting measurements and florescence measurements corresponding to different markers or staining for flow cytometry.",

A \u201cgate\u201d as used herein refers to a selection in one or more dimensions (corresponding to one or more measured parameters) of a subset of items from a larger set of items. For example, gating in the form of a gate or multiple gates may be used to distinguish one type of cells from other types of cells based on data from a flow cytometry system. Conventionally, two-dimensional gates are often used for analysis of flow cytometry data. Gates may be imposed sequentially, such that a subset of items resulting from a prior gate in one or more dimensions (corresponding to one or more measured parameters for the items) is used when determining a further gate in one or more other dimensions (corresponding to one or more other parameters for the items). For example, data corresponding to cells may initially be gated in two dimensions, with data corresponding to cells falling within the gate being used for further gating in other dimensions. Thus, a sequence of two-dimensional gates can be used to identify subpopulations of items (e.g., subpopulations of cells) from a multivariate data set including data for a larger plurality of items (e.g., larger group of cells).",

                                "Cluster Matching Between Samples",
                                "Identifying clusters of data items (e.g., cell populations) and tracking their changes across samples of the same type often reveals the conditions the samples are subjected to, for instance, biological conditions. To study these cross-condition changes, the individual samples may be clustered. Clustering is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2015/0293992 entitled \u201cCluster Processing and Ranking Methods Including Methods Applicable to Cluster Developed Through Density Based Merging\u201d, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference herein. Part of the flow/mass cytometry data analysis process is aligning (matching) cell subsets (e.g., clusters) between relevant samples. The populations present in multiple samples can be aligned and matched post clustering in order to perform a secondary analysis, (e.g., for longitudinal clinical studies, or comparison of multiple experiments). Population matching is one of the most important analytical tools used in the flow/mass cytometry data analysis pipeline in a variety of research/clinical settings. As explained above and below, conventional methods and systems address this cluster-matching/population-matching problem in ways that are computationally expensive, affected by the curse of dimensionality, and/or fail when population patterns significantly vary between samples. The inventors developed methods and systems for matching clusters in data in multiple dimensions (e.g., Hi-D data) corresponding to different samples The methods and systems employ a dissimilarity score based on a quadratic form distance. The methods and systems are both computationally efficient and accommodate data where population locations differ significantly (even disappear or appear) from sample to sample. The inventors demonstrated the effectiveness of some embodiments of the method by employing the method on sample datasets from immunology studies as described below with respect to Examples 1 through 4.",
                                "Recently developed cluster matching methods for tracking populations across samples can be informally divided into two types: separate clustering and matching, and joint clustering and matching, which are described below.",
                                "The separate clustering and matching approach identifies cluster locations in each individual sample (e.g., by using mixture models), see e.g., Pyne et al., Proc. Natl Acad Sci, 2009. This approach then pools these cluster locations for all of the samples in a given class, for example \u201chealthy controls\u201d, and clusters again (e.g., by using partitioning around medoids) to construct a Hi-D template of meta-clusters.",
                                "This type of approach is likely to fail when the population pattern varies significantly between samples (i.e., population locations differ significantly or even (dis)appear from sample to sample) as discussed in detail in Cron et al., PLoS Comput Biol, 2013; and Dundar et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2014. Thus, this approach may fail when a meta-cluster corresponding to distinct cell subsets splits into multiple sub-clusters if extraneous clusters appear in one (or more) of the samples. Further, because the partitioning of individual samples into clusters is performed independently from sample to sample, even quite similar samples may be poorly aligned.",
                                "The joint clustering and matching approach, (e.g., Lee et al., Cytometry part A, 2016; Cron et al., PLOS Comput Bio, 2013; and Dundar et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2014), aligns cell populations based on direct modelling of contributions from individual and grouped samples. It can be thus considered as \u201chierarchical extension of statistical mixture models,\u201d because it applies a hierarchical (multi-level) model that incorporates information from both the individual and group levels when fitted to flow cytometry data. In this approach, an individual sample is considered as a noisy realization of a more general biological population mixture. For example, individual samples could be modelled using a Dirichlet process gaussian mixture model approach (e.g., see Escobar, M. D. & West, M. Bayesian density estimation and inference using mixtures. JASA. 90(430), 577-588 (1995)) and linked through hierarchical prior.",
                                "Both of these approaches rely heavily on fitting mathematical models to identify and match clusters. Accordingly, they are dramatically hindered by the curse of dimensionality because the number of combinations of possible parameters for fitting increases dramatically as the number of dimensions increases above three or four. Additionally, these methods are computationally demanding and often rely on a heuristic to tune a set of input parameters.",
                                "To address the key problems mentioned above, the inventors developed methods that rely on a dissimilarity measure between cell populations that satisfies the following criteria: (1) it should possess the properties of a metric (non-negative symmetric functions that satisfy the triangle inequality and the axiom of coincidence); (2) it should distinguish biologically significant differences from small differences due to instrument drift or other irrelevant factors; (3) it should be non-parametric, to account for the complex structure of the cell populations commonly found in flow cytometry data; and, (4) it should be computationally efficient, so that modern high throughput analyses can be performed quickly. However, constraint #2 (the need to distinguish biologically significant differences) is the most critical for flow cytometry and similar datasets.",
                                "Some conventional cluster matching methods employ the use of a dissimilarity measure between cell populations, such as Joint Clustering and Matching, e.g., see Lee et al., Cytometry part A, 2016, which is based on a symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; and Pyne et al., Proc. Natl Acad Sci, 2009, which relies on a solution of minimum cost bipartite matching (essentially minimum euclidean distance and corresponding weights difference to solve). However, the dissimilarity measurements used in these conventional cluster matching methods do not satisfy the criteria above.",
                                "The inventors determined that distance metrics, which take into account changes in both location and frequency, rather than just changes in one or the other, are the most suitable and accurate methods for comparing multivariate non-parametric flow cytometry data distributions. However, some distance metrics, such as Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) are computationally complex. Further, the EMD can be slow for practical applications of cluster matching tasks in Hi-D flow cytometry.",
                                "To overcome the problems with conventional cluster matching methods, and the speed limitations associated with using a dissimilarity measure that includes the EMD, the inventors developed computationally efficient methods of cluster matching employing a dissimilarity score based on the quadratic form (QF) distance measure, which takes changes both in location and frequency into account and is insensitive to small changes caused by instrument noise. The dissimilarity score based on the quadratic form distance measure (also referred to as the QF dissimilarity score or QF score herein) also satisfies the criteria (1)-(4) discussed above.",
                                "Some methods described herein employ the QF dissimilarity score for multi-dimensional cluster matching for flow and mass cytometry applications.

The method includes matching clusters between data for pairs of samples in the plurality of samples (e.g., between S1 and S2, and between S3 and S4) using the QF dissimilarity score as described herein The matched clusters in a pair of samples are then merged into a corresponding meta-cluster in a template corresponding to the pair of samples (e.g., resulting in templates T(S1, S2) and T (S3, S4). In some embodiments, meta-clusters in a template corresponding to a pair of samples (e.g., templates T(S1, S2)) are matched to meta-clusters in a template corresponding to another pair of samples T (S3, S4).

For example, cluster #4 represents 62% of Sample 2 and its geometric mean is just 0.07 \u03c3 away in one dimension and 0.3 \u03c3 away in the other dimension from cluster #5 that represents 32% of Sample 1. In some embodiments, this additional information helps to accommodate cases when, for example, each sample has only one subset and these subsets belong to different categories (i.e., different cell populations). In some embodiments, a very large distance between geometric means (e.g., greater than a threshold such as >3 \u03c3) may indicated that there is no cluster to match with in the other sample.

                                "Using synthetic datasets shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the inventors verified that a QF dissimilarity score, calculated using equations (1) and (2) above, increases smoothly and monotonically with the growing separation between two subsets (e.g., clusters). Dot plots in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B show two normal distributions: a first large population (black) and a second smaller population (green). The first black population in the panels of FIG. 3A is three times smaller than the first black population the panels of FIG. 3B. For both FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, the mean of the second green population is in the same location as the mean of the first black population in the panel on the left, which is referred to as the \u201c0 stdevs\u201d panel. The mean of the second green population is displaced along the x axis in fixed increments (2 standard deviations) in each of the successive panels from left to right. For each displacement, a QF dissimilarity score was calculated between the first panel on the left corresponding to \u201c0 stdevs\u201d and the combined distribution of the first (black) population with the second (green) population for other panels. As the second green population moves further from the first black population, the QF dissimilarity score increases monotonically as shown in the graphs of FIGS. 3C and 3D, which corresponds to the panels in FIGS. 3A and 3B, respectively. This property of the QF dissimilarity score is important, because it ensures that small differences between clusters (subsets) in either subset location (e.g., due to instrument drift) or subset frequency will be reflected as small changes in the QF dissimilarity score. In general, this is a critical property for cluster matching approaches designed to analyze flow cytometry and similar datasets, where small changes due to instrument noise, calibration, etc. are very common. This property ensures that biologically similar samples with minor data aberrations, e.g., caused by shifts in flow instrument configuration during data collection, will still be well aligned.",
                                "The inventors also performed an analysis to demonstrate the sensitivity, or lack of sensitivity, of the QF dissimilarity score to the binning parameter. Three samples (\u201c0 stdevs\u201d, \u201c4 stdevs\u201d, and \u201c8 stdevs\u201d) were selected from the synthetic dataset shown in the plots in FIG. 3B for a range of bin sizes. The absolute event count for each sample was 3200 (which became 6400 when samples were combined/merged to determine the adaptive binning pattern). The data was binned using n=16; 32; 64; 128; and 256 bins with results for the QF dissimilarity score as a function of bin number shown in FIG. 4A and the corresponding running time shown in FIG. 4B. As shown, the running time increased linearly with the number of bins (see FIG. 4B) while QF dissimilarity scores remained relatively constant (see FIG. 4A).",
                                "Overall the data in FIG. 4A indicate that QFMatch is robust in the choice of the number of bins. However, choosing the appropriate number of bins is a tradeoff between the method's speed and the binning resolution of the sample. Matching samples that contain small populations of cells may require finer binning than matching samples with larger populations only. For example, in some embodiments, for samples that contain small cell populations (e.g., cluster #3 in Sample 2, FIG. 2A), a number of bins may be selected such that there are 2 log2N events per bin, where N is the number of events in the smallest cell subset.",
                                "The inventors also demonstrated that the QF dissimilarity score is invariable with sample size. The size of the data sets shown in FIG. 3B was increased from the original sample size (3200 events including 200 events corresponding to the small green population) by 2-6 times and QF dissimilarity scores were calculated for the combinations of the \u201c4 stdevs\u201d with \u201c0 stdevs\u201d samples and the\u201c8 stdevs\u201d with \u201c0 stdevs\u201d samples using 128 bins.

In some embodiments, the parameters correspond to optical measurements of the items (e.g., cells), such as optical scattering measurements and/or measurements of fluorescence in wavelength ranges associated with particular markers or stains. In some embodiments, the data corresponds to measurements made using cytometry system. In some embodiments, the data corresponds to measurements made using a flow cytometry system.",

For example, in FIG. 8, the first parameter corresponds to measurements of fluorescence in a wavelength range for the IgM stain/marker and the second parameter corresponds to measurements of fluorescence in a wavelength range corresponding to the IgD stain/marker. In some embodiments, the second plurality of items is the same as the plurality of items, meaning that data for each of the plurality of items is shown in the two-dimensional plot.

In some embodiments, the graphical user interface displays the second interactive display (e.g., the guidance window 314) in response to receiving through the graphical user interface a user selection of a guidance feature of the first interactive display. For example, the first interactive display (e.g., plot editor window 310) may include a guidance selection feature in the form of a \u201clook ahead/aside\u201d toolbar icon 312 shown on the plot editor window (see FIG. 8) or a. The guidance selection feature may be in the form of a tool bar button or a right click menu section, or can have any other suitable form. For example, in some embodiments, receiving a user selection of \u201clook ahead/aside\u201d toolbar icon 312 while a subset of data is selected in the plot editor window 310 causes a guidance window 314 to be displayed, where the guidance window 314 includes bar charts showing the 1D staining for all parameters for the subset of the data selected in the plot editor window 310 (see FIG. 9). A selection of a portion of the two-dimensional plot in the plot editor window 310 by the user is a selection of a subset of the second plurality of items having values falling in the selected portion of the two-dimensional plot. In some embodiments, the selection in the two-dimensional plot of a subset of the second plurality of items is the selection of a gate. In some embodiments, receipt of a selection of a portion of the two-dimensional plot through the plot editor window 310 causes data corresponding to the selected subset of the second plurality of items (e.g., a third plurality of items) to be displayed in the single parameter charts or graphs of the guidance window 314. For example, receipt of a user selection the \u201cred\u201d subset, which corresponds to B-1 cells in the plot editor window 314 (as shown in FIG. 8) causes the single parameter charts in the corresponding guidance window 314 in FIG. 9 to display marker staining for parameters for the subset of items corresponding to the selected \u201cred\u201d subset of data.

In some embodiments, the single parameter charts or graphs are arranged along a y-axis in the guidance window 14 and the y-axis shows a horizontal bar for each parameter (e.g., each stain/marker in flow cytometry data) (see FIG. 9). In some embodiments, the y-axis label for each bar chart is a label for the marker used for the stain parameter (see FIG. 9). In other embodiments, the bar charts or graphs are vertical and the x-axis of the includes a label for each single parameter chart or graph.",

In some embodiments, the method further includes displaying a graphical indication in the second interactive display (e.g., the guidance window) for each single parameter chart or graph indicating whether the associated parameter was used in the one or more prior selections to determine the subset of the plurality of items (e.g., whether the associated parameter was previously used in a gate). In some embodiments, the guidance window 314 includes an indication of whether the marker has been used in a gating sequence. For example, in some embodiments, if a marker has not been used in the gating sequence then the corresponding marker label on the y-axis is shown in bold, otherwise, the marker label is not bolded and has a prefix of \u201c>\u201d (see FIG. 9).",

In some embodiments, the visual representation of density is different on one side of the threshold 316 than on the other. For example, in FIG. 9, to the left of the threshold 316 the cell density is represented by grayscale coloring, and to the right of the threshold the density is represented using pseudo colors (e.g., using FlowJo's pseudo color idiom). As another example, in FIGS. 17A-17C, cell density to the left of the threshold is denoted in washed out pseudocolors and the cell density to the right of the threshold is denoted in bright pseudocolors. In some embodiments, additional information is displayed based on the position of the threshold. For example, in FIG. 9, the percentage of the cells above the threshold is indicated on the right side of each bar. In some embodiments, the threshold can be reset based on user input provided based on elements represented on the guidance window (e.g., by a 2nd right click menu or by a scroll bar or slider 318 of the guidance window 314 FIG. 9). In some embodiments, the exact median for all measurements above the threshold can be displayed by selecting a median toolbar feature 322 as shown in FIG. 10 where black triangle 321 indicates such a median value.",
                                "In some embodiments, information displayed in the guidance window 314 stays in sync with the plot editor window 310. For example, if the user selects a different cluster or gate in the plot editor window 310, the display in the guidance window immediately changes to reflect the staining of these cells. FIG. 11 shows a user selection of the green cluster corresponding to B-2 cells in the plot editor window 310 and corresponding updated information graphically displayed in the guidance window 314.",
                                "In some embodiments the guidance window includes an image capture feature (e.g., see camera button 324 in FIG. 12) to save images of the two-dimensional plot in the guidance window, of the single parameter charts or graphs in the guidance window, or both.",

With the look aside feature selected, the guidance window contains single parameter graphs and charts including data for all of the items in the two-dimensional plot editor window, regardless of whether a portion of the two-dimensional plot is selected. In some embodiments, if none of the two-dimensional plot in the plot editor is selected, a user only has the option to open a \u201clook aside\u201d window and a feature for selection of a \u201clook ahead\u201d window is not available.",
                                "In some embodiments, staining parameter markers may be hidden or shown in the guidance window 314 based on user selections of elements associated with the guidance window. For example, in some embodiments, a right click menu or double click menu displayed when hovering over a bar corresponding to a particular marker may be employed to hide the bar for the marker. For example, to hide the less positive CD11b and Gr-1 stain in the guidance window 310, one would hover over each bar, activate the right click menu, and select \u201chide marker from this graph\u201d (see FIG. 14). As an example, to restore the display of either or both stains, the user can click the wrench button on the left side of the toolbar guide window 314 and choose from its \u201cShow markers\u201d sub menu (see FIG. 15).",
                                "In some embodiments, markers/parameters may be hidden in the guide window based on a received user selection of a displayed graphical element associated with the marker/parameter. For example, in FIG. 16A, check marks and \u201cX\u201d marks on the right side of the guide window are used to hide marker parameters. After selection of \u201cX\u201d marks for the parameter to be hidden, confirmation of the parameters to be hidden is requested as shown on the right side. In the screen shot shown in FIG. 16A, the user is about to hide all of the stains that have been previously used in the gating sequence",
                                "In some embodiments, selections received from a user based on features or controls displayed in the guidance window are used to control the plot editor window. For example, in some embodiments, the user can change either the X or Y axis in the plot editor window by dragging the \u201cX=\u201d or \u201cY=\u201d label on the left side of the guidance window to another marker label or horizontal bar, double clicking on a horizontal bar, or right clicking on a horizontal bar and choosing the appropriate menu item. In some embodiments, the guidance window displays features to receive user input to navigate a gating sequence. For example, the guidance window may include buttons on a toolbar that focus the plot editor window on related gate (see buttons 328 in FIG. 9). From left to right the buttons 328 shown in FIG. 9 refocus the plot editor window on: other gates for these sample cells, other gates in this sequence, a parent gate in this sequence, and a child gate in this sequence. In some embodiments, additional options are displayed in the guidance window and user input received based on options displayed in the guidance window change other aspects of the data displayed in plot editor window. For example, in some embodiments, options such as \u201cdistribution & positive staining\u201d, \u201c% positive staining\u201d, \u201cmedian & deviation\u201d, and \u201cmedian & std deviation\u201d may be displayed to a user (see FIG. 17).",
                                "In some embodiments, the guidance window has graphical features for selection of one or more parameters/markers for application of operations to selected parameters/markers. For example, FIG. 17A includes a guidance window having check boxes for selection on the right hand side of the window. As shown in FIG. 17B, after receiving a user selection of one or more parameters/markers using the check boxes (e.g., checked selections of parameters I-Ad and IgM), receipt of a user indication of an adjustment of the threshold line 316 results in adjustment of the threshold line for only the selected parameters (e.g., I-Ad and IgM). In this way the threshold can be adjusted to different levels for different parameters, as needed. When the guidance window is in a \u201clook ahead\u201d mode, adjustment of a threshold line for a parameter that is included in the two-dimensional plot editor window (e.g., see the adjustment of the IgM threshold in FIG. 17C) is reflected in the two-dimensional plot editor window, meaning some of the selected cells in the plot editor window may be de-selected based on negative staining as shown in FIG. 17C.",

For example, see plot editor window 310 in FIGS. 9 and 11.",
                                "In some embodiments, to generate the single parameter charts or graphs for a selected \u201cfocus set\u201d of cells in a plot editor window, the system gathers all staining measurements (not scatter measurements) for the focus set of cells and then computes the density for each measurement separately. The density for each measurement is then rendered either as a histogram visualization or a probability colouring visualization on a horizontal or vertical bar chart om the guidance window.",

For example, changing a selection of a portion of the two-dimensional plot in the plot editor window would cause immediate modification of the corresponding single parameter charts or graphs in the guidance window. Similarly, modification of a threshold in the guidance window for a parameter corresponding to an of the axis in the two-dimensional plot in the plot editor window would cause a simultaneous corresponding modification of the data displayed in the plot editor window.",

In some embodiments, the guidance window and associated functionality guide two-dimensional clustering sequences. In some embodiments, the guidance window and associated functionality facilitate controlling changing parameters for an associated two-dimensional cluster plot in a corresponding plot editor window. For example, using the guidance window, users select one or more staining dimensions and change the associated parameters in the corresponding two-dimensional cluster plot in a corresponding plot editor window. Users can adjust the two-dimensional clusters by removing the negative staining of the dimension(s) selected. Adjustments made by a user in the guidance window may be stored in an analysis template. Methods and systems employing the guidance window and associated functionality may accelerate finding a gating sequence's next step or path forward either when creating an analysis template or after applying it.",

This is a sample that has been stained with every reagent except for the one of interest where the difference between measurements of the FMO control and measurements of the test sample identifies positive events. The inventors developed a method for automatic positive events identification (or automatic background gating) involving overlaying a fully stained sample with the FMO control.",

A cut-off percentile value is defined for the FMO control sample as shown in FIG. 19. In some embodiments, the cut-off value is empirically defined to eliminate of off-scale events and garbage. The dashed line on FIGS. 20A and 2C represents a 95th percentile for the FMO control sample-\u201cFMO line\u201d where FIG. 20A shows the fully stained sample data overlaying the FMO control sample data and FIG. 20C shows only the FMO control sample data. With this FMO line present all of the events below this line within a selected gate (e.g., to the left of the dotted line within the selected cluster) will be automatically ruled out from all of the gating selections (see FIG. 21, where a selected cluster has a black border around it and \u201cruled out\u201d events within the selected cluster are colored in gray).",

Combining Logicle transformation, DBM for cell population identification, probability binning, and QF dissimilarity scores for cluster matching provided a complete pipeline for cluster matching of flow cytometry samples. However, methods for cluster matching of flow cytometric subsets as described here may be implemented for many different types of preprocessing, not just the preprocessing described above implemented with the AutoGate application.

In the original study (Gernez et al., J Cyst Fibros, 2012), the authors used the surface level of CD123 as a phenotypic marker to identify peripheral blood basophils. The expression of this marker commonly varies from patient to patient. For example FIG. 5 includes clusters corresponding to basophil populations (shown in red) that shifted from patient to patient. These basophil clusters in FIG. 5 were identified using the following gating sequence: FSC-A/SSC-A (total white blood cells)\u2192FSC-A/FSC-H (singlets)\u2192CD41a/live/dead (CD41a\u2014live)\u2192Dump [CD3, CD66b, HLA-DR]/CD123 (Dump\u2014, CD123++)]. Method 100 was applied to the preprocessed data and the cluster shown in red was successfully matched even though the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) varied from 1033 to 6672 across the three patients. Importantly, the matching method was capable of aligning such clusters, even when MFI values and the size of the basophil cluster varied from one sample (e.g., patient) to another. Basophil populations in these patient samples had relative frequencies of the same order of magnitude (see plots in FIG. 5) while the distance between their geometric means was significant ([0.6; 0.7]\u03c3 when comparing Patient 1 with Patient 2 and [5.1; 1.6]\u03c3 between Patient 1 and Patient 3)."

As shown in FIG. 7, the clusters highlighted in the same color represented the cell subsets that were matched between PerC and spleen. Unmatched cell subsets were highlighted in light blue for the PerC sample and in violet for the spleen sample.

The method successfully aligned the immune cell subsets that are shared between spleen and PerC (marked in the same colors in FIG. 7) and detected the missing cell subsets (marked in different colors in FIG. 7)."

                                "The inventors incorporated the guidance window functionality described above into the AutoGate application for guided gating of data. Specifically, the guidance window and associated functionality was implemented as a MATLAB object oriented class definition called within the AutoGate application. Initially, a guidance window was used to show density distributions for a selected subset of data in a 2D cluster plot displayed in a plot editor window (see selected SsC Eosinophils in 2D cluster plot in FIG. 22). Specifically, The guidance window was used to probe for positive staining of SSc Eosinophils. The guidance window showed densities for various dimensions and markers in pseudo color (see FIG. 23) and as histograms (see FIG. 24) based on user selections. In FIG. 22, the 2D cluster plot shows CD11b values on the y-axis versus F4/80 values on the x-axis. The SSc Epsinophil gate was then subset on the next highest positive stains indicated by the guidance window as follows. As shown in FIGS. 23 and 24, the two markers for SSc Eosinophils that have higher positive staining (as shown by the single parameter/single marker plots and the indications of median values) and have not previously been used in a gate (as indicated by the lack of lack of italics and \u201c>\u201d in the corresponding label) are I-Ad and Gr-1. The user selects these markers by dragging the \u201cx-label\u201d to the I-Ad marker and dragging the \u201cy-label\u201d to the Gr-1 marker in the guidance window and, based on this user selection, the system changes the 2-D plot in the guidance window to show I-Ad data versus Gr-1 data (see FIG. 25). The SSc Epsinophil gate was subset on the next highest positive stains indicated by the guidance window (see FIG. 25).",
                                "In some embodiments, the user can chose to overlay the sample data with FMO control sample data and the system ensures that all of the gates for finding Ssc Eosinophils in the current sample data are duplicated in the FMO sample using the same reagents. The level of Gr-1 staining at the 99th percentile within an FMO sample is determined with the same gating (see FIG. 26 showing 2D plot of FMO data with all gates applied and 99th percentile line).",
                                "The percentile line from the FMO sample is then overlaid as a gating border to eliminate the 4k cells not expressing real Gr-1:APC staining as shown in FIG. 27.",

In addition, many modifications may be made to adopt a particular situation, material, composition of matter, process, process step or steps, to the objective spirit and scope of the present invention.
