    "abstract": "Facile automated biomacromolecule synthesis is at the heart of blending synthetic and biologic worlds. Full access to abiotic/biotic synthetic diversity first occurred when chemistry was developed to grow nucleic acids and peptides from reversibly immobilized precursors. Protein\u2013polymer conjugates, however, have always been synthesized in solution in multi-step, multi-day processes that couple innovative chemistry with challenging purification. Here we report the generation of protein\u2013polymer hybrids synthesized by protein-ATRP on reversible immobilization supports (PARIS). We utilized modified agarose beads to covalently and reversibly couple to proteins in amino-specific reactions. We then modified reversibly immobilized proteins with protein-reactive ATRP initiators and, after ATRP, we released and analyzed the protein polymers. The activity and stability of PARIS-synthesized and solution-synthesized conjugates demonstrated that PARIS was an effective, rapid, and simple method to generate protein\u2013polymer conjugates. Automation of PARIS significantly reduced synthesis/purification timelines, thereby opening a path to changing how to generate protein\u2013polymer conjugates.",

                "Through pioneering work on PEGylated proteins1,2, where a chain of polyethylene glycol (PEG) is coupled to a biomolecule, the merger of the synthetic and biologic worlds has saved countless lives and driven the application of biocatalysis in a variety of industries1,3\u20137. Protein PEGylation takes place in solution-based grafting-to syntheses where polymers are reacted with the protein surface8,9. This approach usually requires a large excess of polymer, is not easily controlled, and the density of modification can be limited by steric hindrance10. In the last decade, alternative routes to engineer the structure and function of proteins by growing polymers from their surfaces have been developed11\u201315. One common grafting-from approach uses atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from initiators that have been covalently attached to the surface of a protein. The high polymer grafting density and the potential for site-specific polymer growth that protein-ATRP achieves have enabled the synthesis of rationally designed functional protein\u2013polymer conjugates16 with dramatically enhanced stability14,17,18 and therapeutic potential19,20. Growing polymers via ATRP from surface-initiated dissolved proteins is effective, but, the need to remove unreacted initiators, monomers, and catalysts in multiple purification steps has limited the automation of the process and its availability to a broad array of scientists. It can take weeks of careful synthesis and purification to generate just one protein\u2013polymer variant. This challenge would be overcome by growing polymers from proteins that have been reversibly immobilized onto a solid surface.",
                "The growth of reversibly immobilized peptides21 and nucleic acids from solid supports has driven the emergence of automated syntheses and combinatorial chemistry. Perhaps more importantly, peptides and nucleic acid can be generated by non-expert biologists who interface with a simple device instead of a chemical reactor. Reversible immobilization of polymerization precursors on solid supports, such as polystyrene beads, was the foundation from which these elegant syntheses were built. We have been interested in how to reversibly immobilize an entire protein on a solid support, then subsequently react the immobilized protein with ATRP initiators (or other compounds of interest) before site-specific polymer growth. The resulting protein\u2013polymer conjugate could then be released in a pure form from the solid support. Protein-ATRP on reversible immobilization supports (PARIS) would be a powerful transformer of the synthesis and impact of protein\u2013polymer conjugates.",
                "There are a variety of proven chemistries that can reversibly bind proteins to solid supports and some have been used to create grafted-to protein\u2013polymer conjugates22. Non-covalent interactions23 and hydrophobic adsorption24 have been used, but the protein-support interactions are generally weak and protein-specific. Immobilized metal-affinity chromatography is widely used for purification of proteins containing an affinity tag, such as polyhistidine, but this is only applicable for recombinantly labeled proteins25. In addition, stable covalent disulfide bonds between free thiol groups on proteins and solid supports can be reduced to release bound protein26. In order to develop broadly applicable and predictable PARIS syntheses of protein\u2013polymer conjugates, we searched for a covalent and reversible coupling chemistry that could be used with almost any protein. Solid supports functionalized with dialkyl maleic anhydrides can react with primary amine groups on all proteins. This reversible reaction is pH dependent with the complex dissociating at low pH27. The chemistry is highly suitable for proteins that are stable for brief periods at low pH (3\u20134), but can also be tailored for pH-sensitive proteins by increasing the reaction pH (5\u20136), albeit with lower efficiencies.",
                "Herein, we explore immobilization of a protein\u2019s N-terminus \u03b1-amino and/or lysine \u03b5-amino groups to dialkyl maleic anhydride-modified agarose beads, followed by ATRP from subsequently initiator-modified \u03b5-amino groups on the protein surface, prior to protein\u2013polymer conjugate release after reducing pH. PARIS-based synthesis of grafted-from protein\u2013polymer conjugates opens the door to automated combinatorial syntheses and high throughput screening of next generation protein\u2013polymer hybrids."

                        "Peptide synthesis from solid supports has traditionally used polystyrene resins28. Our initial experiments, however, demonstrated that non-specific hydrophobic adsorption of proteins to dialkyl maleic anhydride-modified polystyrene beads was significant. We therefore focused on hydrophilic supports that, we hypothesized, would reduce non-specific protein-support binding and ultimately be able to release a grown-from protein-polymer hybrid. Agarose beads are hydrophilic and are stable at extremes of pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of many denaturants. Currently, agarose beads are widely used in various chromatographic techniques for protein purification29. Dialkyl maleic anhydrides covalently react with primary amines above pH 6 and release below pH 6. Dialkyl maleic anhydride\u00a0(DMA)-modified agarose beads (45\u2013165\u2009\u03bcm) were synthesized (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01) and the pH dependence of on and off rates with a cyanine 3 amine fluorescent dye showed that up to 0.25\u2009\u00b5molDM\u2009mL\u22121beads would be available for protein attachment during PARIS. We next performed each of the four major steps for PARIS (Fig.\u00a01): protein immobilization onto the DMA\u2013agarose beads (pH 6.0 or 8.0); ATRP-initiator immobilization on the agarose-supported protein (using N-2-bromo-2-methylpropanoyl-\u03b2-alanine N\u2032-oxysuccinimide bromide (NHS-Br) as previously described17); surface-initiated ATRP to grow polymers from agarose-supported proteins15; and, cleavage of the resulting protein\u2013polymer conjugates from the agarose supports (below pH 6). Each step of PARIS was characterized with fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02).Fig. 1Solid-phase synthesis of protein\u2013polymer conjugates by protein-atom transfer radical polymerization on reversible immobilization supports (PARIS). Protein is first immobilized onto DMA\u2013agarose beads (at pH 6\u20138) through surface accessible primary amines. Remaining primary amines on the protein are then modified with ATRP initiators (NHS-Br), followed by surface-initiated ATRP, to create functional protein\u2013polymer conjugates. The resulting protein\u2013polymer conjugates are detached from the DMA\u2013agarose beads below pH 6 and pass through a filter in pure form"

                        "Proteins contain a number of accessible amino groups, including the N-terminal \u03b1-amino and lysine side-chain \u03b5-amino groups, that could potentially react with DMA\u2013agarose beads to yield families of immobilized proteins. We hypothesized that we could preferentially target the protein\u2013DMA reaction to the N-terminus of the protein by lowering the reaction pH, thereby generating mostly homogeneous protein\u2013polymer conjugates. Previous studies have shown that acylation of \u03b1-amino groups (N-terminus) is preferred at pH 6.5 while \u03b5-amino groups (lysine residues) react efficiently above pH 8.030. Thus, we first investigated the pH dependence of DMA-lysine and DMA-N-terminal group reactions using Cy5.5 amine and glycyl\u2013glycyl\u2013Cy3 (GGCy3) fluorescent dyes (Supplementary Figs.\u00a03\u20137) as lysine and N-terminal mimics, respectively. The pKa of a lysine side chain is approximately 10.5\u201312.0, while the pKa of the N-terminus is approximately 7.8\u20138.0. Thus, at a pH below 8.0, the N-terminus will have increased nucleophilicity over lysine residues, and we hypothesized that this would lead to preferential immobilization of the \u03b1-amino group to the DMA\u2013agarose beads. Binding and release of these model dyes to the beads were determined as a function of pH and time (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). The data indicated that N-terminal \u03b1-amino-targeted protein binding to DMA beads was achievable at pH 6.0, providing evidence for site-specific immobilization (Supplementary Discussion).",
                        "Next, we investigated the pH dependence of protein immobilization at pH 6.0 and 8.0 and subsequent release over time from pH 3 to 6 using chymotrypsin (CT) as a model protein. At pH 6.0, both binding and release are occurring with variable rates depending on the reacting amino group. From the model dye data we knew that the binding rate at pH 6.0 was greater than the release rate for the N-terminal mimic, while the opposite was true for the lysine mimic (Supplementary Table\u00a01). The total concentration of bound protein after immobilization (1.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 and 4.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u2009mg CT\u2009mL\u22121 beads at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively) was determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. The concentration of immobilized protein achieved by reacting protein and DMA\u2013agarose beads at pH 6.0 was less than that from the reaction at pH 8.0, again suggesting that this reaction could be site-specific since increased pH would increase the number of \u03b5-amino groups that could react with the DMA, thereby significantly increasing the reaction stoichiometry.",
                        "Protein release kinetic studies were then performed over 60\u2009min as a function of pH ranging (pH 3 to 6) for proteins initially immobilized at pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Fig.\u00a02). In both cases, total protein recovered and release rate increased with decreasing pH consistent with the model dye experiments. The percent of protein recovered was calculated after 60\u2009min for each releasing pH. The highest yields were 88 and 100% at pH 3 for initial immobilizations at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively, with the majority of release occurring within the first 5\u2009min (Table\u00a01). To ensure that CT was not inactivated by incubation in releasing buffer, residual activity was measured over time at pH 3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). CT was able to recover full activity at neutral pH even after incubation for 3\u2009h at pH 3. For more sensitive proteins, however, release can be performed at pH 6.0 with 48% recovery. Moreover, in PARIS, the released product (a protein\u2013polymer conjugate) may also have increased acid stability31, further protecting the protein from the acidity of releasing buffer. Herein, we show that protein can be immobilized to and subsequently released from DMA\u2013agarose beads with high recovery and maintained activity. We also show that release is pH dependent, albeit with varying degrees, allowing reaction conditions to be customized to match a given protein\u2019s sensitivity to acid. Importantly, the most likely application of PARIS will be to perform combinatorial syntheses of protein\u2013polymer conjugates for subsequent high throughput screening. In this application, the final yield is less relevant than the ease and speed of synthesis. As long as we can generate enough protein polymer to assay, PARIS will have served its purpose.Fig. 2Reversible protein immobilization to DMA\u2013agarose beads and ATRP initiator modification. a Chymotrypsin release kinetics as a function of pH (3\u20136) after initial immobilization at pH 6.0 (red, determined by microBCA protein assay) and b after initial immobilization at pH 8.0 (purple, determined by microBCA assay).

                        "Following immobilization, the next step in PARIS was ATRP-initiator (NHS-Br) modification of the remaining immobilized accessible protein amino groups. Our assumption was that after the protein was immobilized, the remaining amino groups would be available for ATRP-initiator modification. We further surmised from the model dye experiments that the ATRP initiator would not react with the N-terminus since it was already selectively bound to the beads in the case of pH 6.0 immobilization. CT has 15 primary amines: 14 lysine side chains and an additional \u03b1-amino group on the N-terminus. The number of initiator modifications for CT immobilized at pH 6.0 and 8.0 was determined to be 13 and 11, respectively, from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). We recently reported the use of MALDI-ToF MS after trypsin digestion of protein-initiator complexes to determine where initiators had reacted with proteins13. We used the same strategy to study modification sites on released initiator-modified CT. We did not observe modification of the N-terminal amino group by ATRP-initiator at pH 6.0, supporting our emerging view that DMA\u2013agarose beads reacted with CT at the N-terminal amino group at low pH (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). In contrast, we observed N-terminal modification with ATRP initiator after immobilization at pH 8.0 indicated by the absence of the peptide fragment peak."

For the polymer, we decided to grow poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCBMA), a hydrophilic and zwitterionic polymer, from the surface of the initiated and reversibly immobilized enzyme. Zwitterionic polymers stabilize CT against irreversible inactivation at extremes of temperatures and pH 17,39.",
                        "We expected that CT-pCBMA conjugates would grow from initiator sites on protein\u2013DMA\u2013agarose beads. We were particularly interested in whether the pH of immobilization and the agarose beads themselves would impact the structure and function of the subsequently released enzyme. The chemical structure of CT-pCBMA was initially characterized with 1H NMR and FT-IR (Supplementary Figs.\u00a011, 12). We further compared the released PARIS-CT conjugates to both solution-based CT-pCBMA conjugates and native CT (Fig.\u00a03). Following release from the DMA\u2013agarose beads, protein concentration was determined spectroscopically. We first characterized released CT-pCBMA conjugate hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The released conjugates grew in Dh from 4.4\u2009nm (native CT) to approximately 9\u2009nm, independent of immobilization pH. Solution-based CT-pCBMA conjugates were slightly larger than PARIS-synthesized conjugates (Table\u00a02). We further characterized the conjugates through acid hydrolysis to cleave the polymer followed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showing polymer molecular weights of 9.2 and 8.2\u2009kDa for CT immobilized at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively with low polydispersity indices (PDI) for each.Fig. 3Properties of released PARIS-synthesized protein\u2013polymer conjugates.

Samples were incubated in 100\u2009mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 50\u2009\u00b0C) at 3.9\u2009\u03bcM CT and residual activity was measured over 6\u2009h. All CT-pCBMA conjugates showed enhanced thermostability compared to native CT. CT-pCBMA immobilized at pH 6.0 with a free N-terminus showed the highest thermostability.

Conjugates synthesized by PARIS did not alter activity in comparison to solution-synthesized CT-pCBMA and native CT",
                        "We further compared the activity of released PARIS-CT conjugates to native CT and CT-pCBMA grown in solution. The turnover number and Michaelis constant (kcat and KM) showed that all conjugates had similar activities with N-succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide (suc-AAPF-pNA) (Table\u00a02). Since the PARIS conjugates immobilized at pH 6.0 and 8.0 had similar activities, the location of protein-bead immobilization did not significantly alter CT activity. Naturally, if polymer growth from the terminal amino group was performed on a protein that was sensitive to N-terminal modification, we would expect the activity of the conjugate to be lower from PARIS conjugates immobilized at pH 6.0. It is also worth noting that protein\u2013polymer conjugates typically have reduced catalytic efficiencies through a combined decrease in kcat due to structural stiffening40 and decrease in KM due to the polymer\u2019s superhydrophilicity17. The overall catalytic productivity, kcat/KM, of PARIS CT-pCBMA was similar to both solution-synthesized CT-pCBMA and native CT.",
                        "Next, we sought to demonstrate that PARIS conjugates maintained the same stabilizing effect as conventionally synthesized protein\u2013polymer conjugates in solution. Protein\u2013polymer conjugates synthesized in solution have shown enhanced stability to extremes of pH41, temperatures18, and organic solvents42 due to the protective polymer coating. PARIS-CT conjugates significantly enhanced the thermostability of the enzyme at 50\u2009\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a03). Native CT was irreversibly inactivated after approximately 2\u2009h at 50\u2009\u00b0C. Both PARIS CT-pCBMA and solution-based CT-pCBMA had significantly increased stability. Interestingly, PARIS conjugates that were initially immobilized at pH 6.0 were significantly more stable after 6\u2009h at 50\u2009\u00b0C than those from pH 8.0. Previous studies have shown that many proteins have regions that are particularly susceptible to stability-impacting modifications and in many proteins the N-terminus is the most thermally sensitive region43\u201346. Additionally, enzymes with increased thermostability are often more hydrophobic47,48. Since the N-terminus in CT was located in a largely hydrophobic area, disruption of this hydrophobicity by initiator modification and consequent hydrophilic polymer growth could have decreased the thermostability of the pH 8.0 PARIS CT-pCBMA."

                        "We next explored whether DMA\u2013agarose beads used in PARIS disrupted ATRP reaction kinetics. Thus, ATRP kinetics of PARIS and solution-synthesized conjugates were compared (Tables\u00a03\u20134). Polymer growth was monitored over 60\u2009min for a fixed monomer concentration of 25\u2009mM by measuring Dh of conjugates at specified time points using DLS (Table\u00a03 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a013). Additionally, polymers were cleaved from the conjugates at each specified time point, and their molecular weights and PDIs were measured using GPC (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). Polymer molecular weight did not increase significantly after 5\u2009min indicating that the ATRP reaction was fast and completed within the first 5\u2009min. Comparison of PARIS and solution-based conjugates showed similar overall polymer growth, however, PARIS conjugates displayed lower PDIs. The agarose bead pore size used in PARIS was approximately 30\u2009nm, which could have provided a uniform microenvironment during chain propagation leading to lower PDIs and more uniform conjugates. In conventional solution-based ATRP, polymer molecular weight can be tuned to a desired value by increasing the monomer to initiator ratio during the ATRP reaction. To show that conjugate size could be easily varied by PARIS, the monomer concentration was systematically increased from 12.5 to 100\u2009mM and conjugate Dh, polymer molecular weights, and PDIs were determined for a 60\u2009min reaction time (Table\u00a04). As expected, conjugate Dh and polymer molecular weight increased with increasing monomer concentration for both PARIS and solution-based conjugate synthesis (each maintaining low PDIs) (Supplementary Figs.\u00a013, 14). In summary, we were excited to observe that for pCBMA, highly uniform conjugates were synthesized by PARIS within 5\u2009min, polymer molecular weights were predictably controlled, and PARIS conjugates were similar, perhaps even more homogeneous, compared to solution-synthesized conjugates.Table 3PARIS and solution-based conjugate ATRP kineticsSamplea D h b Cleaved pCBMAc(nm) M n  M w PDISolution\u00a05\u2009min12.3\u2009\u00b1\u20094.210100144001.42\u00a010\u2009min13.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.99800139001.44\u00a020\u2009min12.8\u2009\u00b1\u20097.510000147001.47\u00a040\u2009min11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.39800142001.45\u00a060\u2009min11.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.811000167001.50PARIS\u00a05\u2009min7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.29600123001.28\u00a010\u2009min7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.59900128001.29\u00a020\u2009min9.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.39600125001.30\u00a040\u2009min8.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.010000133001.33\u00a060\u2009min9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.410600147001.39Fixed monomer concentration of 25\u2009mM.

                        "Although our results with CT conjugates synthesized by PARIS were exciting, an important step was to demonstrate that PARIS could be applied to a breadth of unrelated proteins. We sought to demonstrate that solution-synthesized conjugates were nearly identical to PARIS-synthesized conjugates. To do this, we selected a series of proteins with varying sizes, structures, and N-terminii accessibility: lysozyme (Lyz, Mw,monomer\u2009=\u200914.3\u2009kDa), avidin (Mw,tetramer\u2009=\u200968\u2009kDa), acetylcholinesterase (AChE, Mw,tetramer\u2009=\u2009272\u2009kDa), and uricase (Uox, Mw,tetramer\u2009=\u2009140\u2009kDa). As with CT, we first determined whether the reaction between DMA\u2013agarose and protein was N-terminus specific for each protein. Our combined data from all proteins showed that the immobilization reaction was N-terminus selective at pH 6.0, as long as the \u03b1-amino group was surface accessible, and was independent of protein size and quaternary structure (Supplementary Figs.\u00a015, 18, Supplementary Table\u00a02, and Supplementary Discussion). Initiator-modified proteins were also characterized by MALDI-ToF MS to determine the number of modification sites after initial immobilization at pH 6.0 and 8.0 (Supplementary Figs.\u00a019\u201321). After successful protein-ATRP with pCBMA, followed by release, the protein\u2013polymer conjugates were fully characterized (Table\u00a05). The percent of recovered conjugate was decreased in comparison to the prior released native protein experiments, with the highest conjugate recovery obtained from the smallest starting protein size (51% for lysozyme). This result was not surprising since larger conjugates could become more trapped inside the pores after polymer growth, thus hindering full release. We are currently exploring a number of methods to optimize release. For example, agarose bead pore size can be increased to accommodate larger proteins, multiple incubation steps in releasing buffer can be performed in series, or the ratio of releasing buffer to agarose bead solution can be increased. We have also been encouraged by early results with agarase-induced release optimization.Table 5PARIS synthesis and characterization of ranging proteinsProteinProtein on beadsaReleased protein\u2013pCBMAb D h c Cleaved PolymerdRatio of activitye(mg protein per mL beads)(mg protein per mL beads) (% recovery)(nm) (solution)Mn (kDa) (Mw/Mn) (solution)(PARIS: solution)Lysozyme1.890.97 (51%)9.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 (7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6)19.8 (1.37) (15.0 (1.26))1.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13Avidin3.541.05 (30%)13.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 (21.7\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4)13.2 (1.30) (16.1 (1.34))1.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14Chymotrypsin2.010.89 (44%)8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 (10.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4)10.6 (1.39) (11.0 (1.50))1.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24Acetylcholinesterase0.790.16 (20%)13.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 (13.9\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2)14.5 (1.35) (7.2 (1.33))1.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08Uricase0.430.09 (21%)10.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 (12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0)32.4 (1.50) (14.7 (1.30))2.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15a Concentration of immobilized protein per 1\u2009mL of beads determined by microBCA protein assayb Concentration of released conjugate per 1\u2009mL of beads and percentage of recovered protein determined by microBCA protein assayc Hydrodynamic diameter measured by dynamic light scattering (number distribution)d Number average molecular weight and polydispersity index of cleaved pCBMA from PARIS conjugates determined by gel permeation chromatography and compared to solution-based conjugatese Ratio of conjugate activity of PARIS to solution-based approaches.

                        "Hydrodynamic diameters were also similar for each PARIS-synthesized and solution-synthesized conjugate pair. Polymers were also cleaved and analyzed using GPC to provide complete characterization. All polymers maintained low PDIs whether synthesized by PARIS or in solution.",
                        "We also were interested in whether each of the PARIS-synthesized conjugates would have the same activity as solution-synthesized conjugates. We note here that in this paper we were not seeking to optimize conjugate activity for each of the proteins used. Activity assays were performed, specific for each enzyme (Supplementary Tables\u00a03\u20136), and activities were reported as a ratio of PARIS-synthesized to solution-synthesized conjugates (Table\u00a05e). In all cases, PARIS conjugates had maintained activities compared to solution-based conjugates. Additionally, lysozyme and uricase conjugates synthesized by PARIS had twice the activity over their solution-based counterparts. We have not performed extensive enough experiments in order to be able to claim that PARIS generates more active conjugates, but the data are promising. For acetylcholinesterase, we discovered that the enzyme was sensitive to release at pH 3, but successful release at pH 5 enabled a comparison with solution-synthesized conjugate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a022). Overall, we were pleased to observe that conjugate synthesis via PARIS chemistry was not only suitable for a breadth of proteins, but also easily tunable for a specific protein\u2019s sensitivity. While we have not yet focused on yield optimization, the PARIS strategy is not limited to the release chemistry we selected in this initial demonstration of solid-state protein-ATRP. The PARIS data were comparable to conventional solution-generated data in terms of both physical and functional bioconjugate properties. PARIS is a reliable protein\u2013polymer conjugate synthesis method that would be straightforward for any biologist to perform."

                        "We developed PARIS in order to be able to generate protein\u2013polymer conjugates in hours versus weeks, and to simplify and automate the chemistry involved. The conceptual attractiveness of flowing reactants into a column reactor, removing unreacted initiator, removing unreacted monomers, and purifying the conjugates by release from the beads drove us to design a PARIS-flow reactor (Fig.\u00a04a). CT was bound to the DMA\u2013agarose beads, reacted with initiator, and then released from the DMA beads in the reactor after polymerization. PARIS synthesis of CT-pCBMA in the flow reactor was compared to batch synthesis. Our data showed that conjugates synthesized in batch-mode and flow-mode had similar structure and function. The Dh of the conjugates released from the automated flow-based reactor were 8.7 and 9.2\u2009nm for CT initially immobilized at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively (Table\u00a06). Similarly (and in agreement with results from the batch synthesis), both PARIS conjugates synthesized in the flow reactor had enhanced thermostability at 50\u2009\u00b0C relative to native CT, while the most thermostable conjugate was CT-pCBMA that had been immobilized at pH 6.0.Fig. 4Automated one-pot rapid PARIS protein\u2013polymer conjugate synthesis and properties. a The experimental setup of a flow reactor for PARIS. b Irreversible inactivation of native CT and CT-pCBMA at 50\u2009\u00b0C.

                        "Conventional protein\u2013polymer conjugates that are grown from proteins require initiator modification, followed by days of separation and purification of initiator-modified proteins from excess initiator, and then 2\u20134 days of polymerization and final purifications. The flow reactor experiment described above was completed in less than 6\u2009h. While the individual steps of conjugate synthesis between solution-based and PARIS-based approaches were similar, the PARIS purification steps were rapid and readily automated. This reduction in synthesis and purification time, coupled with our ability to multiplex the system, removed the complexity barrier from protein\u2013polymer conjugate synthesis. It is currently difficult to predict how polymer conjugation will affect the resulting conjugate\u2019s overall function. Since PARIS conjugates were similar in structure and function to solution-based conjugates, an attractive feature of the flow reactor design was that high throughput synthesis would allow more rapid screening of a multitude of protein\u2013polymer conjugates.",
                        "PARIS is a synthetic approach that allows solid-phase synthesis of grafted-from protein\u2013polymer conjugates. PARIS generates conjugates with similar structure and function to traditional protein-ATRP in solution. Importantly, PARIS can be performed in a simple flow reactor, opening the door to automated and combinatorial protein\u2013polymer conjugate syntheses. We believe that PARIS will have a significant impact on the accessibility of protein\u2013polymer conjugate synthesis to a broad array of protein scientists and engineers."
