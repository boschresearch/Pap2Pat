                        "Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or African sleeping sickness, visceral and cutaneous leishmaniase (VL and CL, respectively), and Chagas disease (resulting from Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, and Leishmania sp.) are a constellation of parasitic diseases that represent a significant health problem in the developing world. The World Health Organization estimates that over 22 million people are currently infected with one of these illnesses annually, all of which are debilitating and potentially fatal unless treated. However, current therapeutic interventions are significantly lacking, all with limited efficacy or life-threatening side effects. There are clear Target Product Profiles (TPPs) for new treatments, but a disproportionately small fraction of biomedical research is directed at the identification of such compounds. Since these diseases predominantly affect the very poor, they are recognized by WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration as \u201cneglected diseases\u201d in need of improved interventions.",
                        "Transmitted by the bite of infected insects, these diseases are treated by agents that are far from optimal in terms of safety, efficacy, and dosing methods. Currently, Stage I HAT is treated with two different drugs. The first is suramin, which has been used since the 1920s, administered by IV infusion over 30 days. The molecular target and mechanism of action for suramin are unknown and patients typically display detrimental side effects such as kidney failure, anaphylaxis, or neurological effects. The other Stage I treatment is pentamidine, which was first introduced in the 1940s and, similar to suramine, its mechanism of action is unknown. Pentamidine has fewer side effects, but requires intramuscular injection for 7 days. Neither of these drugs are effective against Stage II as they are incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB).",
                        "There are two currently approved treatments for Stage II HAT. The first is melarsoprol, an organo-arsenic compound which is capable of crossing the BBB. Its mechanism of action is unknown and it is quite effective in treating HAT, but there are severe side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and post-treatment reactive encephalopathy (PTRE). These side effects contribute to a 5% fatality rate in treated patients. The other treatment option for Stage II HAT is eflornithine, an irreversible ornothine decarboxylase inhibitor, which requires daily IV infusions up to 400 mg/kg per day for three weeks. Eflornithine has serious side effects, including anemia and convulsions, and is expensive to produce, leading to a large cost for treatment.",
                        "Similarly, VL has four treatment options: pentavalent antimonials, various formulations of amphotericin B, miltefosine, and paromomycin, all of which have problems with efficacy and toxicity. Only miltefosine can be administered orally. Antimonials are very toxic with side effects ranging from cardiac arrhythmia to pancreatitis. Amphotericin B treatment is very effective, but requires 30 days of hospitalization for clinical observation, a requirement that is not practical or even possible in some of the poorest nations. Miltefosine is advantageous due to its oral bioavailability, but is not safe for women who are or may become pregnant. Paromomycin is safe and inexpensive, but requires injections for 21 days.",
                        "Chagas disease therapeutics are principally the nitroaromatic compounds benznidazole and nifurtimox. Although both are orally-administered drugs, they require lengthy treatments and have significant side effects.",
                        "Thus, new treatments are needed for all three types of parasitic disease."

Notably orthologous proteins are highly divergent from those of the human host. These include predicted kinases related to the eukaryotic class I and II PI3Ks, PI4Ks, and PIKKs including TOR, ATM and ATR ([26,27], and data not shown). Where tested, PI3Ks appear to be essential for viability and/or virulence in trypanosomatids. Two PIK subfamily members have been examined in T. brucei. The trypanosome Class III PI3K TbVps34 has an essential function in membrane trafficking and in Golgi segregation during cell division [28]. These authors suggested that, similar to yeast, T. brucei possesses only one genuine PI3K. TbPI4K\u03b2 is also an essential protein in T. brucei, required for maintenance of Golgi structure, protein trafficking, and cytokinesis [28]. Trypanosomatids possess four distinct genes belonging to the TOR family, in contrast to mammals, which possess a single mTOR protein [29,30,31,32]. TORs act in concert with other proteins in complexes referred to as TORCs, which have different protein subunit compositions, and cellular functions [33].",
                                "In T. brucei, the two conserved signaling complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, whose functions appear analogous to that described in mammalian or yeast TORCs, mediate the essential functions of TOR1 and TOR2 for cell growth [32,34]. While TbTORC1 regulates protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and autophagy, TbTORC2 plays a key role in maintaining the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for the proper functioning of endocytic processes, cell division, and cytokinesis [29,35]. Correspondingly, TOR1 and TOR2 are essential genes in Leishmania major [30]. Recent work has characterized a third TOR protein, TOR3, in Leishmania major and T. brucei, that is implicated in the formation of acidocalcisomes and participation in stress response [30,31]. A fourth TOR in T. brucei and Leishmania (TOR4) lacks the FRB domain responsible for binding rapamycin-binding proteins, yet possesses all other characteristic domains of TOR kinases [29,30].",

They can also be administered by intranasal application, inhalation, topically, orally, or as implants, and even rectal or vaginal use is possible. Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or saline solutions for injection or inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of present methods for drug delivery, see Langer R (1990) Science 249:1527-33, which is incorporated herein by reference.",

Liquid dose units are vials or ampoules for injection or other parenteral administration. Solid dose units are tablets, capsules, powders, and suppositories. For treatment of a patient, depending on activity of the compound, manner of administration, purpose of the administration (i.e., prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and severity of the disorder, age and body weight of the patient, different doses may be necessary. The administration of a given dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller dose units. Repeated and multiple administration of doses at specific intervals of days, weeks, or months apart are also contemplated by the invention.",
                                "The compositions can be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts can conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group.",

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents are water, Ringer's solution, phosphate buffered saline, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed mineral or non-mineral oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Carrier formulations suitable for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, etc. administrations can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.",

The particular mode selected will depend, of course, upon the particular compound selected, the age and general health status of the subject, the particular condition being treated, and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention, generally speaking, can be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of response without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Preferred modes of administration are discussed above.",
                                "The compositions can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the compounds into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the compounds into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.",
                                "Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono-di- and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which an agent of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b) diffusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation."

FIG. 1 shows EC50 determinations of WYE-354, PP242, PI-103, and NVP-BEZ-235 in T. brucei rhodesiense. To identify inhibitors of trypanosome TORs or PI3Ks, a range of compounds with varied potencies and selectivities against mTOR/PI3K were selected. In mammalian cells, compounds Ku-0063794 [21,22], Pp242 [18], and WYE-354 [48] inhibit the kinase domain of mTOR selectively with low nanomolar IC50 values. LY294002 is a mixed inhibitor targeting both mTOR/PI3K [49], and many analogs have been made (including LY303511, which inhibits mTOR-dependent and independent pathways, but does not inhibit PI3Ks [50,51]). PI-103 inhibits PI3Ks with high potency and mTOR with a reported 20 nM IC50 [52,53,54]. Compound 401, a compound structurally related to LY303511, inhibits mTOR and cellular growth at low micromolar concentrations [55], while NVP-BEZ235 inhibits both PI3Ks and mTOR with sub-nanomolar IC50 values [56,57].",

To study infective forms of T. cruzi, compounds were added simultaneously with trypomastigotes to 3T3 fibroblast host cells and incubated for four days. This protocol thus monitors all steps of the T. cruzi infective cycle (entry, differentiation and replication as amastigotes) as well as potential effects mediated through host cell PI3Ks. The results of the in vitro assessment of this inhibitor collection are shown in Table 2.",

Interestingly, the BSF T. brucei gambiense, ELIANE strain [37] was even more sensitive, with an EC50 of 179 pM. PI-103 showed good activity against T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense cultures (200 and 100 nM, respectively). The other inhibitors showed micromolar activity against T. brucei brucei, and, as observed with NVP-BEZ235, these inhibitors are approximately ten-fold more potent against T. b. rhodesiense. The variation in potency of NVP-BEZ235 across different strains of T. brucei, (including the T. brucei brucei Lister 927 strain) is comparable to that seen in similar studies of pentamidine, an established drug (Table 3).",

For this compound amastigotes lysis within host cells was observed after three days when the drug was dosed at 350 nM (\u02dc3\u00d7 the EC50; FIG. 11A). In FIG. 11A, NIH-3T3 host cells were incubated with T. cruzi trypomastigotes for 2 hours before addition of NVP-BEZ235 (350 nM). Cells were incubated for 4 days during which time the parasites differentiate and replicate as amastigotes. At that time cells were fixed and stained with an anti-T. cruzi antiserum (green) and DAPI to visualize DNA (blue). The upper panel shows control cells with intact amastigotes, and the lower panel shows debris of parasite proteins throughout the host cell cytoplasm. In contrast, NVP-BEZ235 showed little activity (EC50>50 \u03bcM) against free trypomastigotes, which do not replicate outside of host cells. This suggests that NVP-BEZ235 could act specifically against the amastigotes stage, or by activation of host cell responses.",

The remaining four inhibitors (LY294002, LY303511, Compound 401 and Ku-63794) were inactive against L. major promastigotes and L. donovani axenic amastigotes at the highest concentration tested and were not tested against L. donovani promastigotes. While some compounds showed statistically significant differences amongst the Leishmania strains/species, the differences were modest and not studied further.",

                                "We examined effects of several of the strongest inhibitors on cell size, shape and/or DNA content, since mTOR and PI3K inhibitors affect the size of both mammalian and T. brucei cells and induce characteristic growth phase arrests [29,58].",
                                "Sixteen hour treatment of BSF T. brucei brucei with drug at an effective concentration (described below) produced two different types of effects on cellular DNA content (FIG. 11B). FIG. 11B and FIG. 11C show the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of cell size (Forward Scatter, FSC) and DNA content after drug treatment. In FIG. 11B, bloodstream form culture of T. b. brucei was subjected to different drugs, indicated to the side, and analyzed by FACS for cell size and DNA content stained by propidium iodide. Cell cultures were incubated during 16 h with PI-103 (1 \u03bcM), WYE-354 (2 \u03bcM), Pp242 (2 \u03bcM) and NVP-BEZ235 (100 nM), represented with dark lines, and with DMSO as control population, represented as shaded area. Two drugs, (PI-103 and Pp242), tested at 1 \u03bcM and 2 \u03bcM, respectively) induced G1 arrest, an effect maintained even at low concentrations of Pp242 (200 nM, data not shown). While the inhibitor PI-103 showed a clearly defined profile in cell cycle progression, NVP-BEZ235 produced a combination of effects on the cell cycle progression at 0.1 \u03bcM, including the appearance of zoids (anucleated cells) [59] and multinucleated cells. This relatively high dose of NVP-BEZ235 (10\u00d7 the EC50) produced a reduction of G1 and G2 cells. Finally, treatment of T. b. brucei cells with WYE-354 resulted in no significant variations in cell cycle, with a small but noticeable reduction in cell size.",
                                "We examined the effect on cell size and DNA content for the four compounds that displayed activity against L. major promastigotes, using drug concentrations (EC60-EC90) that were strongly inhibitory, but without inducing complete growth arrest or cellular toxicity (as evidenced by PI exclusion tests, not shown). For all concentrations tested, both PI-103 and WYE-354 treatment induced a G1 arrest and a decrease in cell size (FIG. 11C) as seen for start here mTORC1 inhibitors in mammalian cells. FIG. 11C shows results from the treatment of Leishmania major promastigotes. Dark lines are WT parasites examined when in logarithmic growth phase; shaded areas are parasites grown in the presence of the indicated concentration of drug. Cell size (FSC) and DNA content (PI staining) were determined as indicated in Panel B and/or as described in the Methods. The subpanels show data for PI-103 (4 \u03bcM, \u02dcEC90); WYE-354 (25 \u03bcM, \u02dcEC60); NVP-BEZ235 (0.5 \u03bcM, EC90) and Pp242 (dashed lines 12.5 \u03bcM/\u02dcEC90, shaded area 25 \u03bcM/\u02dcEC90). In contrast, NVP-BEZ235 treatment induced G2 growth arrest and increased promastigote size in a manner similar to the cell phenotype observed in mammalian cells exposed to mTORC2 inhibitors. Microscopy data suggests that the G2 arrest was actually due to altered cytokinesis, as evidenced by the abundance of individual cells that contain 2 nuclei and kinetoplasts (data not shown), again consistent with known effects of mTORC2 inhibition in mammalian cells. Though PI-103, WYE-354 and NVP-BEZ235 generated single phenotypes, Pp242 generated two different phenotypes depending on the drug concentration. At lower concentrations, Pp242 induced a decrease in cell size and a G1 arrest, while at higher concentrations a G2 arrest and increase in cell size was observed (FIG. 11C). This suggests the likelihood of inhibition of multiple targets with various affinities within the parasite.",

                                "The most active inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, was chosen for testing in appropriate animal models of T. brucei rhodesiense, T. cruzi, and L. major infection. Using the highest tolerable doses appropriate for each infection model, no efficacy was observed against either T. cruzi (30 mg/kg, 5 days, intraperitoneal) or L. major (12.5 mg/kg/day, 10 days, oral gavage) (data not shown). Weight loss was observed in drug-treated mice infected with L. major and higher drug doses were lethal.",
                                "In contrast, a marked decrease in parasitemia was observed by intraperitoneal dosage (5 or 10 mg/kg) of NVP-BEZ235 in T. brucei rhodesiense infected mice. Drug was administered once per day, for four days. A dramatic decrease in parasitemia was observed within two days, below the detection limit of 104 parasites/mL. All mice in the untreated group died the 6th day post-inoculation, while the mean survival day (MSD) for animals treated with 5 mg/kg of NVP-BEZ235 was extended to 10.8 (\u00b12.4) days. The MSD of mice treated with 10 mg/kg increased to 13.4 (\u00b13.3) days, doubling the survival of the control group (FIG. 12). FIG. 12 shows the trypanocidal activity of NVP-BEZ235 in an acute mouse infection model. The arrow indicates the drug dosing schedule. The mean parasitemia for each group is represented for each day up to the death of all mice in a group. The mean survival day (MSD) is labeled in the graphic with daggers.",
                                "These experiments have identified small molecules useful for further medicinal chemistry optimization and for gaining a better understanding of molecular pharmacology. Noting the functional and structural homology between TOR and PI3Ks in humans and trypanosomatids and encouraged by the surprising growth inhibitory phenotype resulting from suppression of TOR in T. brucei [60] and L. major [30], we identified and procured eight established inhibitors for assessment against parasite cultures. Several of these inhibitors inhibited parasite growth in all species/strains tested, and one, NVP-BEZ235, reduced parasitemia in an animal model of T. brucei rhodesiense infection, significantly extending survival.NVP-BEZ235 showed very potent inhibition of T. brucei growth, with a phenotype similar to that seen previously in genetic studies of TOR and TbVps34 [28]. A modest treatment regime (10 mg/kg, for four days) was able to eliminate 80% of the parasites in T. b. rhodesiense infections. The in vitro potency (179 pM EC50) observed against T. b. gambiense was exceedingly high, at a level rarely seen against these protozoan parasites. The reason for the difference in potency between T. b. rhodesiense and gambiense is not known at this time. While not limited by any mechanism of action, T. b. gambiense, with a lower generation rate and poorer adaptation to culture than T. b. rhodesiense, may be more affected by an antiproliferative drug as NVP-BEZ235. This difference was also observed between T. b. brucei Lister 427 and 927 (Table 3). The potency of this compound and the complex cell cycle phenotype observed suggest that the compound likely has a number of molecular targets in T. brucei, perhaps affecting other essential cellular functions besides cell proliferation.",
                                "T. cruzi was relatively insensitive to the inhibitors compared to T. brucei. While not limited by any mechanism of action, this may arise from the fact that T. cruzi trypomastigotes, the form of the parasite that proliferates in the human, only replicates in the intracellular environment. As a consequence, compounds need to cross the plasma membrane of the host cell to have access to T. cruzi, while T. brucei is directly accessible to the drugs in the bloodstream. When NVP-BEZ235 was tested against free, non-replicating T. cruzi trypomastigotes, it was inactive, while it induced lysis of intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes. This raises the possibility that this compound acts either specifically against the amastigote stage, or through effects on host cell PI3Ks, or some combination. The involvement of host cell PI3K and mTOR pathways in immune evasion has been recently reported for L. donovani [61].",
                                "Leishmania showed a range of sensitivities to the panel of inhibitors, with the most potent compounds active at sub-micromolar concentrations. This may be compared to the efficacy of current front line anti-leishmanial agents, whose potencies when measured by methods similar to those described here range from 30 nM for amphotericin B to 15 uM for antimonial based compounds (Seifert et al, 2011).",
                                "The EC50 values for the compounds tested were similar for L. major promastigotes, L. donovani promastigotes and L. donovani axenic amastigotes, suggesting that preliminary screening against a single form could be sufficient in the future. However, despite its potency against L. donovani axenic amastigotes, high doses of NVP-BEZ235 against L. major infections of mice showed no therapeutic effect (data not shown). As discussed above for T. cruzi, the lack of efficacy in the animal model of L. major could reflect a similar need for the drug to traffic to the phagolysosomal compartment where Leishmania reside. The 12.5 mg/kg regime tested here resulted in severe weight loss (not shown) suggesting attempts to treat with higher doses of NVP-BEZ235 would result in significant toxicity.",
                                "Current data suggest there are at least 12 members of the PI3 Kinase protein superfamily, for which the phenotypic effects of inhibition or genetic deletion in T. brucei or Leishmania are known for only five. Thus, it is unknown what the likely cellular target may be. However, with an eye towards initial identification of specific targets potentially involved in the activity of NVP-BEZ235, we note a similar cell cycle phenotype that Hall et al. reported upon RNAi knockdown of TbVsp34 [28], including the appearance of zoids, multinucleated cells and reduction of G1 and G2 (FIG. 11B). Barquilla et al. also showed the same pattern after RNAi of TOR2 [35].",
                                "In trypanosomes and mammals, TORC1 inhibition is known to result in G1 arrest and debreased cell size, while TORC2 results in G2 arrest and increased cell size [29,33,62,63,64,65]. In both T. brucei and Leishmania PI-103 resulted in G1 arrest and cell size reduction, while NVP-BEZ235 resulted in aberrant cell cycle and multiple cell sizes (FIG. 11). WYE-354 also resulted in G1 arrest/cell size decrease in Leishmania. In contrast, while Pp242 showed G1 arrest/cell size decrease in trypanosomes, this was only found at lower drug concentrations in L. major, and at higher drug concentrations G2 arrest and increased cell size was observed instead. Thus, while the effects of specific inhibitors on trypanosomatids may resemble those seen against mammalian cells targeting specific TOR or PI3K targets, future studies will be required to more definitely establish the true mode(s) of action against the individual parasite species, which may differ.",
                                "It appears that the mTOR/PI3K inhibitors display generally superior activity against trypanosomatid growth over mTOR-selective inhibitors. This may be suggestive of the effect being mediated via inhibition of multiple trypanosomal PI3Ks, including PI3KKs such as TOR. With that in mind, efforts to identify the mechanism of action of these mTOR inhibitors in trypanosomatids will direct further medicinal chemistry efforts. Despite the lack of certainty of the mechanism of action of these compounds, the results provide a validation for the repurposing approach as a screening tool as an efficient approach to identification of compounds that are effective in parasite killing."
