Terms defined herein have meanings as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the areas relevant to the present invention. Terms such as \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are not intended to refer to only a singular entity, but include the general class of which a specific example may be used for illustration. The terminology herein is used to describe specific embodiments of the invention, but their usage does not delimit the invention, except as outlined in the claims.",
                                "As used herein, \u201cnucleic acid\u201d or \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuclease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers that are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA), or analogs of naturally-occurring nucleotides (e.g., \u03b1-enantiomeric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in pyrimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, such as aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoranilidate, phosphoramidate, and the like. The term \u201cnucleic acid molecule\u201d also includes so-called \u201cpeptide nucleic acids,\u201d which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either single stranded or double stranded.",
                                "An \u201cisolated nucleic acid molecule\u201d as used herein is a nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism. For example, a DNA molecule that encodes a growth factor that has been separated from the genomic DNA of a cell is an isolated DNA molecule. Another example of an isolated nucleic acid molecule is a chemically-synthesized nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genome of an organism. A nucleic acid molecule that has been isolated from a particular species is smaller than the complete DNA molecule of a chromosome from that species.",
                                "As used herein the terms \u201cprotein\u201d, \u201cpolypeptide\u201d or \u201cpeptide\u201d refer to compounds comprising amino acids joined via peptide bonds and are used interchangeably. A \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds, whether produced naturally or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about 10 amino acid residues are commonly referred to as \u201cpeptides.\u201d A \u201cprotein\u201d is a macromolecule comprising one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may also comprise non-peptidic components, such as carbohydrate groups. Carbohydrates and other non-peptidic substituents may be added to a protein by the cell in which the protein is produced, and will vary with the type of cell. Proteins are defined herein in terms of their amino acid backbone structures; substituents such as carbohydrate groups are generally not specified, but may be present nonetheless.",
                                "An \u201cisolated polypeptide or protein\u201d is a polypeptide or protein that is essentially free from contaminating cellular components, such as carbohydrate, lipid, or other proteinaceous impurities associated with the polypeptide in nature. Typically, a preparation of isolated polypeptide contains the polypeptide in a highly purified form, i.e., at least about 80% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, greater than 95% pure, or greater than 99% pure. One way to show that a particular protein preparation contains an isolated polypeptide is by the appearance of a single band following sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein preparation and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. However, the term \u201cisolated\u201d does not exclude the presence of the same polypeptide in alternative physical forms, such as dimers or alternatively glycosylated or derivatized forms.",
                                "The term \u201chomology\u201d as used herein refers to the extent to which two nucleic acids are complementary. There may be partial or complete homology. A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid and is referred to using the functional term \u201csubstantially homologous.\u201d The degree or extent of hybridization may be examined using a hybridization or other assay (such as a competitive PCR assay) and is meant, as will be known to those of skill in the art, to include specific interaction even at low stringency",

As will be understood by those in the art, this functional term includes both genomic sequences, cDNA sequences, or fragments or combinations thereof, as well as gene products, including those that may have been altered by the hand of man. Purified genes, nucleic acids, protein and the like are used to refer to these entities when identified and separated from at least one contaminating nucleic acid or protein with which it is ordinarily associated.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cvector\u201d is used in reference to nucleic acid molecules that transfer DNA segment(s) from one cell to another. The vector may be further defined as one designed to propagate specific sequences, or as an expression vector that includes a promoter operatively linked to the specific sequence, or one designed to cause such a promoter to be introduced. The vector may exist in a state independent of the host cell chromosome, or may be integrated into the host cell chromosome",
                                "As used herein an \u201cexpression vector\u201d is a nucleic acid molecule encoding a gene that is expressed in a host cell. Typically, an expression vector comprises a transcription promoter, a gene, and a transcription terminator. Gene expression is usually placed under the control of a promoter, and such a gene is said to be \u201coperably linked to\u201d the promoter. Similarly, a regulatory element and a core promoter are operably linked if the regulatory element modulates the activity of the core promoter.",
                                "As used herein the term \u201chost cell\u201d refers to cells that have been engineered to contain nucleic acid segments or altered segments, whether archeal, prokaryotic, or eukaryotic. Thus, engineered, or recombinant cells, are distinguishable from naturally occurring cells that do not contain recombinantly introduced genes through the hand of man.",

When describing \u201ctranscribed nucleic acids\u201d those sequence regions located adjacent to the coding region on both the 5\u2032, and 3\u2032, ends such that the deoxyribonucleotide sequence corresponds to the length of the full-length mRNA for the protein as included. The term \u201cgene\u201d encompasses both cDNA and genomic forms of a gene. A gene may produce multiple RNA species that are generated by differential splicing of the primary RNA transcript. cDNAs that are splice variants of the same gene will contain regions of sequence identity or complete homology (representing the presence of the same exon or portion of the same exon on both cDNAs) and regions of complete non-identity (for example, representing the presence of exon \u201cA\u201d on cDNA I wherein cDNA 2 contains exon \u201cB\u201d instead). Because the two cDNAs contain regions of sequence identity they will both hybridize to a probe derived from the entire gene or portions of the gene containing sequences found on both cDNAs; the two splice variants are therefore substantially homologous to such a probe and to each other",

These terms refer to synthetic as well as naturally-derived molecules and include sequences that possess biologically, immunologically, experimentally, or otherwise functionally equivalent activity.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cpolymerase chain reaction\u201d (PCR) refers to the method of K. B. Mullis U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, and 4,965,188, hereby incorporated by reference, which describe a method for increasing the concentration of a segment of a target sequence in a mixture of genomic DNA without cloning or purification. This process for amplifying the target sequence consists of introducing a large excess of two oligonucleotide primers to the DNA mixture containing the desired target sequence, followed by a precise sequence of thermal cycling in the presence of a DNA polymerase. The two primers are complementary to their respective strands of the double stranded target sequence. To effect amplification, the mixture is denatured and the primers then annealed to their complementary sequences within the target molecule. Following annealing, the primers are extended with a polymerase so as to form a new pair of complementary strands. The steps of denaturation, primer annealing and polymerase extension can be repeated many times (i.e., denaturation, annealing and extension constitute one \u201ccycle\u201d; there can be numerous \u201ccycles\u201d) to obtain a high concentration of an amplified segment of the desired target sequence. The length of the amplified segment of the desired target sequence is determined by the relative positions of the primers with respect to each other, and therefore, this length is a controllable parameter. By virtue of the repeating aspect of the process, the method is referred to as the \u201cpolymerase chain reaction\u201d (hereinafter \u201cPCR\u201d). Because the desired amplified segments of the target sequence become the predominant sequences (in terms of concentration) in the mixture, they are said to be \u201cPCR amplified\u201d. With PCR, it is possible to amplify a single copy of a specific target sequence in genomic DNA to a level detectable by several different methodologies (e.g., hybridization with a labeled probe; incorporation of biotinylated primers followed by avidin-enzyme conjugate detection; incorporation of 32P-labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates, such as DCTP or DATP, into the amplified segment). In addition to genomic DNA, any oligonucleotide sequence can be amplified with the appropriate set of primer molecules. In particular the amplified segments created by the PCR process itself are, themselves, efficient templates for subsequent PCR amplifications.",
                                "The present invention describes the isolation and characterization of two protein isoforms collected green fluorescent copepods. The cDNA expression libraries synthesized from the isolated mRNA yielded the genes responsible for the green fluorescence in the Pontellid copepods and indicated similarities to the GFP first isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria.",
                                "The two isolated Pontella mimocerami GFP-like isoforms are 72% similar to the other known copepod GFP-like proteins, but are much more similar to other Pontellid GFP-like proteins than to the distantly related fluorescent copepod Chiridius poppei (family Aetideidae). The new isoforms are quick to mature, rapidly producing a fluorescent signal. The two isoforms are very similar in molar extinction coefficients (ME) with 105,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 for pmimGFP1 and 103,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 for pmimGFP2. Quantum yields of pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 are 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. The relative brightness of these two new copepod GFP-like proteins is the highest measured for any isolated GFP-like protein.",
                                "Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have revolutionized biomedical research. Because of their ability to self-assemble and their non-invasive, non-cytotoxic qualities, fluorescent proteins have been adapted for myriad uses in the labGFP and its derivatives have accelerated life science research by being extensively used as genetically encoded in situ and in vivo markers38-42 since first being isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, phylum Cnidaria4-6 To date, about 120 fluorescent and colored GFP-like proteins had been cloned only from hydrozoans and anthozoans of the phylum Cnidaria. Past rationale suggested that fluorescent proteins would be exclusively found in cnidarians and that these proteins would also necessarily be coupled to the luminescent systems that are common in these marine animals.7-8 However, this dogma was rejected with the discovery that GFP-like proteins could be isolated from other non-luminescent organisms such as corals (Phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa), copepods (phylum Arthropoda, class Crustacea), and amphioxus (phylum Chordata, subphylum Cephalochordata).7,9-10",
                                "So far only seven GFP-like proteins have been identified from the copepod families Pontellidae and Aetideidae.7,11 In general, the GFP-like proteins from this group of arthropods have qualities such as rapid maturation, high brightness, and increased photostability, all extremely valuable for use as a biotechnology tool. Isolation and characterization of more GFP-like proteins in Pontellidae will likely continue to provide a better source from which to harvest fluorescent proteins that may be adapted for use in the laboratory and in biomedical research.",
                                "In the present invention, the inventors cloned, and characterized two novel genes coding for GFP-like proteins from a Pontellid copepod (Pontella mimocerami, first described by Fleminger, 1957)12 in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the Bahamas Islands along with the isolation and characterization of two novel GFP-like protein isoforms, pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2. The two isoforms are similar in their amino acid sequences (FIGS. 6A and 7A, respectively) and share similar spectral characteristics to each other as well as to other copepod GFP-like proteins. The nucleic acid sequences of pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2, are shown in FIGS. 6B and 7B, respectively. However, the two isoforms of the present invention are the brightest isolated green fluorescent proteins to date.",

After 20 minutes, the net was removed and the collected organisms were inspected with blue light illumination (BlueStar, NightSea; Andover Mass.) to excite the fluorescent proteins. The organisms were photographed under white and blue light provided by a Leica light source and filter (Canon Powershot G6, Leica MZFLIII microscope, and Chroma filter #11003 BL/VIO, FIG. 4). Several green fluorescent copepods were transferred to an empty culture dish with a transfer pipette and identified to the family level, Pontellidae. Total RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (Ambion's RNAqueous kit) according to manufacturer's protocol and the samples were stored on board the ship in 6.65 M LiCl at \u221280\u00b0 C. The specimens for identification were preserved by freezing in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. (Sakura Finetek; Torrance, Calif.).",
                                "Preparation and screening of bacterial cDNA expression library: cDNA was synthesized and PCR-amplified using SMART cDNA amplification kit (Clontech; Mountain View, Calif.) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.), with two modifications. First, a different oligonucleotide was used for priming the reverse transcription reaction: 5\u2032AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTCGCAGTCGGTAC(T)13V (where V stands for a mixture of A, G, and C bases) (SEQ ID NO.:9). For the first step in cDNA amplification, the following long oligonucleotide was used in lieu of the one provided with the SMART cDNA amplification kit: AGT GGA CTA TCC ATG AAC GCA AAG CAG TGG TAT CAA CGC AGA GT 3\u2032 (SEQ ID NO.:10). The PCR reactions contained 0.3 \u03bcM of primers. The thermocycler profile was: 94\u00b0 C. for 5 m, 94\u00b0 C. for 40 s, 68\u00b0 C. for 4 m, cycle to step two for 26 additional cycles, hold at room temperature. The product from this step was diluted 1:10 and 3 \u03bcl of this dilution was used for the second step in cDNA amplification. For this second amplification step, three separate reactions were performed. The first one used the same oligonucleotide as in the first amplification step; the other two reactions used the same oligonucleotide, but extended by either one or two T bases at the 5\u2032 terminus. These PCR reactions contained 0.1 \u03bcM of primer, the thermocycler profile was 94\u00b0 C. for 5 m, 94\u00b0 C. for 40 s, 68\u00b0 C. for 4 m, cycle to step two for 5 additional cycles, hold at room temperature. Such conditions bias the PCR amplification towards longer products31, generating a cDNA sample enriched with full coding regions. Also, these additional amplifications ensured that upon ligation into vector, each cDNA species would be represented by inserts fused to the leading lacZ peptide in all three possible reading frames. The products of amplification were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, Calif.) and ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega; Madison, Wis.) following manufacturers' protocols. The ligations were transformed into TOP 10 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene; Cedar Creek, Tex.) and the total transformation expression library was plated onto Luria Burtani (LB)/Agar plates supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C. and then screened at one day post-transformation for green fluorescent colonies using a Leica MZ FLIII microscope with GFP specific filter #51004v2 F/R (Chroma Technology Corp).

                                "Molar extinction measurements: Determination of the molar extinction coefficient (ME) was based on the fact that the green-emitting GFP chromophore in the alkali-denatured protein has a characteristic peak of absorption at 445 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 44,000 liter mol\u22121cm\u22121,33 which is independent of the sequence of the protein since the influence of the sequence-specific chromophore environment is removed by denaturation. This fact provides a useful internal standard for determination of the ME in the native state in any GFP-like protein with a GFP-like chromophore. This strategy was first suggested by Gurskaya et al34, and since then was adopted in several studies characterizing natural GFP-like proteins9,35. The measurement involves determining the absorption of the same concentration of the protein in alkali-denatured and native conditions, and calculating the native ME based on a simple proportion. Strictly speaking, the ME determined in this way correspond to the fully-formed GFP chromophore, not the protein; but since each properly functioning GFP-like polypeptide generates and hosts exactly one chromophore molecule, it is possible view this measurement as absorption of 1M concentration of protein chains under ideal conditions (100% chromophore biosynthesis efficiency and no degradation). This measure is independent of the oligomeric state of the protein, and is free of potential sources of error related to measurements of protein concentration or biases due to incomplete chromophore maturation, therefore providing grounds for comparison of brightness characteristics across GFP-like proteins from various sources. In this study, to achieve better accuracy, the inventors measured the ME using a range of concentrations. Fluorescent proteins (0.8 \u03bcg, 2 \u03bcg, 4 \u03bcg, 6 \u03bcg, and 8 \u03bcg protein) were diluted in either denaturing (0.1M NaOH) or non-denaturing (1\u00d7PBS) buffers, in a total volume of 150 \u03bcl. The absorbance was read for all the samples from 400 nm-550 nm with a 5 nm interval. Then, the maximal absorbance values of the native proteins were plotted against the absorbances at 445 nm of the denatured proteins for the range of dilutions. The ME of the native protein was calculated as the slope of the linear regression of this graph multiplied by the ME of the denatured GFP chromophore at 445 nm (44,000 liter mol\u22121cm\u22121,33).",
                                "Fluorescence quantum yield measurements: To determine the quantum yield of fluorescence (QY, the fraction of photons emitted of the total number of photons absorbed), the same dilutions of the native proteins were excited at 450 nm and the relative fluorescence output between 480 nm and 600 nm was determined by summing up all the fluorescence values for each wavelength with a 5 nm interval. The same set of dilutions for the QY standards (fluorescein, QY=0.9 and EGFP, QY=0.6) were prepared and measured in a similar fashion. The total fluorescence for each dilution was plotted against the absorbance of each dilution at excitation wavelength (450 nm). The QYs of the new proteins of the present invention were calculated by comparing the linear regression slopes of our samples to those of our standards. The error of the QYs measurements was calculated using the Delta method 36. For all quantitative spectroscopic measurements, SpectraMax M2 microplate reader with the provided software (Molecular Devices, SoftMax Pro v5; Sunnyvale, Calif.) was used.",
                                "Oligomerization and aggregation: To determine the oligomeric status of the new copepod GFP-like proteins of the instant invention, the inventors analyzed the proteins using SDS-PAGE in a 4-15% gradient gel with SDS-Tris-Glycine buffers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). To resolve GFP-like proteins in the native state, the samples were not boiled before loading on the gel, and visualized after the run by their native fluorescence. This method of oligomerization assessment utilizes the fact that most GFP-like proteins do not lose their oligomeric state or fluorescence unless boiled in SDS, and their mobility on an SDS gel roughly corresponds to their globular size. This was first noticed and exploited in studies of oligomerization of the red fluorescent protein DsRed18, followed by demonstration of the utility of this approach for assessing oligomerization in a variety of other GFP-like proteins19, 35. Since it is theoretically possible that SDS would disrupt oligomers but not unfold the protein, the method is applied conservatively, such that the only result that is considered relevant is the presence of oligomerization or aggregation, whereas the apparent lack of oligomerization does not necessarily imply the monomeric state of the protein in the absence of SDS. Since the mobility of such non-denatured protein does not correspond to its molecular weight measured by the markers that assume full polypeptide unfolding, a special set of standards for appropriate globule sizes is necessary to evaluate the oligomeric state. In the present invention, as monomeric and tetrameric standards, the inventors used recombinant GFP (rGFP) and DsRed2 proteins, respectively (Clontech, Mountain View, Calif.). In gels obtained in the present invention, the native monomeric GFP ran as a band at 37 kDa, while tetrameric DsRed2 ran at 60 kDa. The mobility of these standards was consistent across gels, making it possible to use the standard marker lane (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.) to infer their position. In addition to SDS-PAGE of unboiled samples with band visualization via native fluorescence, the inventors also ran the same samples after boiling (i.e., under fully denaturing conditions) on the same gels, and used coomassie staining to identify the bands specific for the unboiled samples.",

The modifications include mutating the Cys at 139 to Ser and the Phe at 192 and 221 to either Ala or Asp.

However, when the imidazole was removed, the proteins formed large aggregates that almost completely precipitated out of solution. In order to perform the spectral and protein gel analyses, 250 mM imidazole was added back to the protein solution, which re-solubilized the aggregates. The spectral analyses revealed that the new copepod GFP-like proteins of the present invention are similar in some aspects to the other Pontellid GFP-like proteins, with the exception of Chiridius poppei, a copepod from the Aetideiae family. The molar extinction coefficients for pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 are 105,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 and 103,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 respectively, notably higher than the average copepod molar extinction coefficient of about 89,000 M\u22121cm\u22121. Quantum yields of pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 are 0.94 and 0.92, respectively, notably exceeding even the highest QY seen in a copepod species (Pontella meadi at 0.74). However, the calculated absorption and emission peaks of pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 (491 and 505 respectively, FIG. 2) are very similar to the other copepod GFP-like proteins (absorbance max between 480-490 nm, emission max between 500-511 nm).",

There seems to be pronounced difference between pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 resistance to SDS-induced unfolding. In SDS-PAGE of unboiled samples, pmimGFP1 fluoresces strongly, while pmimGFP2 is barely visible roughly at the tetramer mobility (FIG. 3A). Coomassie staining of the same lanes (FIG. 3B) indicated that the majority of pmimGFP2 protein appears as a band at 25 kDa, corresponding to the mobility of the protein under fully denatured conditions (note that every GFP-like protein in this gel actually unfolds somewhat in SDS even without boiling). FIG. 3C shows all of the proteins in a fully denatured state, with all protein masses around 25 kDa. Both copepod proteins are 222 amino acids long with a predicted molecular weight of 25 kDa.",

The present inventors chose to replace three amino acids, two positively charged ones (K5 and R9), and one cysteine (C8) as a potential disulphide bridge-forming one. FIG. 3D shows an SDS-PAGE of unboiled samples of mutants of pmimGFP1. Mutant 1 (K5E) shows increased mobility (i.e., less aggregation/oligomerization), but also substantially decreased brightness. Mutant 2 (K5T) is still very bright, but shows no change in mobility. Mutant 3 (K5T, C8S, R9A) matches the mobility of the tetrameric standard (DsRed2) and appears bright in the gel. From the above findings, it can be concluded that, although the mutagenesis alleviates aggregation, the best mutant protein of the present invention still forms oligomers, most likely tetramers. Despite its apparent brightness, the triple mutant also demonstrates diminished molar extinction coefficient (75,000 M\u22121cm\u22121) and quantum yield (0.35) in comparison to the parent protein, indicating that either the breakdown of the higher-order aggregates, or the effect of the particular mutations within a single monomer, were detrimental for the protein's brightness characteristics.",

The photostability was assayed for the pmimGFP1 and its non-aggregating mutant relative to EGFP in the conditions approximating a typical application of the protein as a genetically encoded fluorescent label, by comparing the rates of photobleaching of protein emulsion droplets under the fluorescent microscope (FIG. 5B). The time to half-photobleaching of pmimGFP1 is 0.8 of EGFP, while its non-aggregating mutant is essentially identical to EGFP in this regard. Both pmimGFP1 and its mutant show non-exponential dynamics of photobleaching, with the highest photobleaching rate at the start of exposure. Notably, past the half-bleaching point both proteins photobleach at a similar rate, which is slightly lower than for EGFP (FIG. 5B).",
                                "Copepod luminescence was first documented long ago, but it was also observed that some luminescent species exhibited an additional fluorescence located at the site of the luminous glands.20, 21 However, the genus of copepods that were collected in the present invention, Pontella, exhibited only green fluorescence and no luminescence.21 Since these organisms are not luminescent, it eliminated the need for the fluorescent protein serving as a chromatic shift agent, hinting that green fluorescence in these creatures can serve some other function. Although copepods don't feature compound eyes such as some other crustaceans, the Pontellidae nauplius eye is well developed, featuring an elaborate triple-lens construction in the enlarged ventral eyes in the males22 and even though the biological roles for Pontellidae fluorescence are not proven, having well developed eyes in males may assist in locating brightly fluorescent females and interspecies signaling. Pontellidae fluorescence may also offer protective counter-shading, i.e., protecting the copepods from recognition in their oceanic environment9, 23-24 this function would be analogous to the well-documented function of bioluminescence in dim ocean zones.9,23,24,37",

The second amino acid in the C. poppei GFP-like protein is threonine, which is known to leave the primary methionine vulnerable to removal. All of the Pontellid GFP-like proteins have a proline in the second position, which may be protective.25-27 These similarities contribute support for the closer phylogenetic relationships among the Pontellid GFP-like proteins. FIG. 1A represents the phylogenetic tree of all of the known copepod GFP-like proteins. The tree suggests that C. poppei is at least closely related to the other Pontellid copepod species, expected since C. poppei belongs to a different copepod family, Aetideidae. The light transforming chromophores of both pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 proteins contain the same amino acid sequence, Gly-Tyr-Gly, as the other known copepod GFP-like proteins; the Tyr and second Gly are strictly conserved among all fluorescent proteins. Also, the Arg and Glu amino acids responsible for the autocatalytic steps of chromophore formation are present at positions 96 and 222, respectively GFP numbering (positions 87 and 221 in the pmimGFPs). Copepod GFP-like sequences tend to lack tryptophan residues9; pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2 each have only one at position 158. The only other copepod GFP-like protein to contain tryptophan is from L. aestiva, which may share a common ancestor with the two new copepod fluorescent isoforms.",

Evdokimov noted a similar tendency to aggregate in the copepod GFP-like protein, ppluGFP29, and suggested this aggregation may be the result of electrostatic interactions between the charged surfaces of the fluorescent protein.21,30 Evdokimov's research used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to develop a non-aggregating version of ppluGFP2 protein, now designated as TurboGFP. In the present invention several amino acid residues (K5, C8, and R9) at the N-terminus were replaced with others (E, T, S, or A) that are less likely to enhance aggregation19 as well as to remove the 6\u00d7His tag.

                                "The brightness of a GFP-like protein is proportional to the product of two factors: molar extinction coefficient (ME) and quantum yield (QY). Of these, ME strongly depends on the excitation wavelength, in the fashion described by the absorption spectrum of the protein. With a particular application in mind, it may be useful to compare the brightness characteristics of all proteins at a fixed excitation wavelength dictated by the application, which is sometimes done by companies advertising their GFP-related markers. In most cases, however, to compare general photophysical properties of GFP-like proteins their brightness is defined as a product of QY and ME at the own absorption maximum of each protein, for which the standard reported ME corresponds. This \u201ccalculated brightness\u201d is different from the absolute brightness, which is defined as the number of photons emitted divided by the number of photons incident on the chromophore, but is assumed to be directly proportional to it and hence represents a useful measure for comparison. In terms of calculated brightness, the new Pontella mimocerami proteins described herein are the brightest green emitting fluorescent proteins known to date, with a calculated brightness of 95,000-99,000 M\u22121cm\u22121. Only one other fluorescent protein, a red protein derived from DsRed called tdTomato, approaches this value with a calculated brightness of 95,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 (35). The calculated brightness of the new proteins is three-fold greater than the one of EGFP, the most widely used genetically encoded fluorescent marker. Thus, these new copepod GFP-like proteins have a good potential to become excellent reporters, at least in applications that tolerate oligomeric FP labels (such as monitoring promoter activity, organelle tracking, or cell and tissue labeling). Still, their very high aggregation tendency would be a problem even for such applications, which prompted the present inventors to create a mutant of pmimGFP1 that does not aggregate (although still oligomerizes). Interestingly, the non-aggregating mutant demonstrates a higher pH stability (pKa=4.7) than its ancestral pmimGFP1, but has a calculated brightness of only 26,000 M\u22121cm\u22121. Additional random mutagenesis may help to restore some of the lost brightness. Further mutagenesis is also required for adaptation of the new proteins for imaging applications involving molecular fusions, which must rely on monomeric protein tags.",
                                "The present invention describes two novel FPs from Pontella mimocerami (Copepoda, Calanoida, Pontellidae), collected off the coast of the Bahamas Islands. These two proteins, pmimGFP1 and pmimGFP2, were identified via fluorescence screening bacterial cDNA expression library prepared from whole-body RNA of P. mimocerami. The FPs described hereinabove, have high molar extinction coefficients (105,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 for pmimGFP1 and 103,000 M\u22121cm\u22121 for pmimGFP2), as well as high quantum yields (0.94 for pmimGFP1 and 0.92 for pmimGFP2). The spectroscopic characteristics of the two FPs from P. mimocerami make them the brightest green FPs ever described in the literature, whether isolated from a natural source or engineered in the laboratory. Because of this, these proteins are a valuable addition to any in vivo imaging toolkit.",
