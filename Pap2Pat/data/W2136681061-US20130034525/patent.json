                        "Understanding the mechanisms of \u03b2-cell homeostasis and regenerative repair is crucial not only to provide new insights on diabetes mellitus pathogenesis, but also to address potential therapeutic application. Islet cell transplantation may be a promising approach for cell replacement in type 1 diabetes. However, islet availability for allogeneic transplantation is limited (Lakey et al. 2006, Shapiro et al. 2006). In addition, understanding the origin of new \u03b2-cells in adults may help devise ways of slowing down progression of type 2 diabetes.",
                        "The mechanisms by which \u03b2-cell mass is maintained in adulthood are not yet known and the origin of new \u03b2-cells in adults is the focus of intensive research. The literature is replete with studies trying to characterize a putative pancreatic progenitor cell in and outside the pancreas that could explain \u03b2-cell neogenesis in adult life. Should such a cell be identified, it could be used as a potential source of cell therapy. It has been demonstrated that replacement of \u03b2-cells in the post-natal period precedes both the proliferation of existing mature \u03b2-cells (Dor et al. 2004), and the neogenesis of new \u03b2-cells from progenitor epithelial cells. It has been proposed that these adult pancreatic progenitor cells reside in the epithelium of the pancreatic duct (Bouwens & Kloppel 1996, Bonner-Weir 2000, 2001), inside islets (Zulewski et al. 2001) and in the bone marrow (Janus et al. 2003).",
                        "Nestin is an intermediate filament protein known as a marker of neuroepithelial stem cells, because it is expressed transiently in early developmental stages as well as in the process of tissue regeneration in various organs (Lendahl et al. 1990, Morshead et al. 1994, Matsuoka et al. 2002). Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of nestin positive cells within the islet, the acinar and the ductal compartment of the prenatal and newborn pancreas (Hunziker & Stein 2000, Zulewski et al. 2001, Kim et al. 2004, Yashpal et al. 2004). The developmental progression and the change in nestin immunoreactivity throughout the fetal pancreas to postnatal transition suggest that nestinpositive cells are probably a population of progenitor cells within the pancreas (Yashpal et al. 2004). Moreover, Zulewski et al. (2001) described the existence of a distinct population of cells within islets and in a focal region of pancreatic ducts and exocrine pancreas expressing nestin that can proliferate and differentiate into pancreatic, exocrine, ductal and endocrine cells in culture. A recent publication showed that suppression of nestin expression in embryonic stem cells by gene silencing reduced endodermal and pancreatic transcription factor expression (Kim et al. 2010). During embryonic development, neural and islet cells express a subset of markers in common. Developing islet cells express several neuronalspecific markers, such as synaptophysins, nerve-specific enolasis (Alpert et al. 1988), and transcription factor genes such as Isl-1, Pax6, Pax4, b2/NeuroD, and IDX1 (Reynolds & Weiss 1996, Madsen et al. 1997, Sander & German 1997).",
                        "Therefore, these data suggest that nestin could be a common marker of a precursor stem cell for both neuronal and islet cell types. The inventors' group previously demonstrated that a subpopulation of nestin-expressing cells, isolated from bone marrow is able to generate cellular spheres similar to neurospheres derived from brain neural stem cells. These cells from bone marrow could differentiate into all three neural phenotypes (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) in vitro and in vivo (Kabos et al. 2002, Zeng et al. 2007). Recent studies showed that bone marrow-derived stem cells could reverse the hyperglycemic phenotype in a diabetic animal model but the mechanism behind the rescue or regeneration of pancreatic islets is still debated (Hasegawa et al. 2007, Xu et al. 2007, Gao et al. 2008, Zhao et al. 2008).",
                        "Diseases like diabetes are largely caused by a breakdown in cell function or by cell death. The major issue of diabetes is an inability to control the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Insulin therapy has saved the lives of many type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. However, 50% of diabetics develop chronic diabetes-related complications that appear years after the onset of diabetes (including blindness, renal failure, myocardial infarction, and non-traumatic amputation).",
                        "Despite studies showing that strict blood glucose control decreases the incidence of secondary complications of diabetes, euglycemia is difficult to achieve with any current method of exogenous insulin replacement. Although transplantation of the whole pancreas or islets of Langerhans demonstrates the physiologic advantages of transplanting insulin-producing cells over insulin administration, these approaches are far from perfect. Ideally there are two possible solutions: identifying the perfect \u201csurrogate \u03b2-cell\u201d to be used for cell therapy or inducing regeneration of endogenous damaged \u03b2-cells.",
                        "Stem cells from bone marrow offer an attractive source of stem cells as alternative to pancreas and pancreatic islets transplantation for curative and definitive treatment of insulin dependent diabetes. They are already proved to be safe in clinical trial and they can be obtained with relative ease from each patient, allowing potential circumvention of allograft rejection. Previous work suggested that the mouse BMSCs spontaneously differentiate into endocrine pancreas cells in vivo. In recent reports, BMSCs injected into the circulation of diabetic animal has been shown to partially/totally reverse the diabetic phenotype and improve glucose control, but with very poor direct \u03b2-cell differentiation, leading to other possible roles of BMSCs in the pancreatic islet regeneration. According, additional treatment methods are needed in the art.",
                        "Encouragingly, as further described herein the introduction of transcription factor genes into cultured human BMSCs was able to activate a number of genes related with development and function of \u03b2-cells. Moreover, the forced expression of Pdx1 gene by a virus vector in human BMSCs showed the activation of gene expression of all four islets hormones and also enhancement of significant insulin content."

                        "\u201cTreatment\u201d and \u201ctreating,\u201d as used herein refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent, slow down and/or lessen the disease even if the treatment is ultimately unsuccessful.",
                        "Described herein is a novel culture system in order to obtain insulin producing cells derived from nestin-positive bone marrow cells (n-BMSC). This procedure successfully induced n-BMSC to express lineage-specific transcription factor, in particular Pdx1, which has been shown to drive pancreatic differentiation.",
                        "The cells were pretreated with 5-AZA to inhibit DNA methylation, which has been recognized in important differentiation processes, such as osteoblast (Vaes et al. 2009), cardiomycyte (Tomita et al. 1999) and more recently pancreatic endocrine differentiation (Lefebvre et al. 2009). The cells were subsequently treated with TSA based on the belief that chromatin remodeling will enhance the induction and further differentiation toward pancreatic lineage, although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory. Acetylation or deacetylation of histone terminal domains can regulate gene expressions. Histone acetyltransferases and HDACs can loosen or compact chromatin structures and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues (Zhang et al. 2002, Chang et al. 2004). As the acetylation status of nucleosomal histone modulates chromatin structure and epigenetically regulates gene expression, an inhibitor of both classes I and II HDACs such as TSA may be used to loosen the chromatin structure and more easily permit differentiation through epigenetic manipulation. Moreover, a recent study from Haumaitre et al. (2008) showed that HDAC inhibitors can modify the timing and the determination of pancreatic cell fate with inhibition of exocrine and enhancement of ductal and endocrine differentiation. In the experiment described herein, after exposure to 5-AZA and TSA, the cells lost nestin expression and after being cultured in a medium containing ITS and RA, they also turned on expression of mRNA encoding transcription factors such as Pdx1, NgN3 and Pax6, known to play important roles in the developmental program leading to the formation of pancreatic islets (Jensen 2004). Moreover, the expression of these transcription factors followed the timing consistent with the normal mammalian pancreatic development. PDX1 was expressed in the second step after exposure to RA and ITS medium and subsequently expression of both PAX6 and NGN3 were activated. In the last step, a more mature phenotype of ductal and endocrine pancreatic cells appeared. These cells lost the expression of PAX6, and upregulated PDX1, insulin, glucagon, GLUT2 and CK19.",
                        "Another important step in this differentiation protocol is the use of RA to induce differentiation of n-BMSC towards a pancreatic phenotype. In the experiment described herein, it was extremely important to time the exposure to RA, right after the cell treatment with TSA. RA has been shown to control multiple steps in the motor neuron differentiation in the ventral spinal cord (Novitch et al. 2003). In an experiment, Ostrom et al. (2008) showed that RA is present in the developing mouse and human pancreas and is required for pancreas development. Moreover, all-trans RA has been widely used to promote generation of PDX1-positive pancreatic progenitor cells from mouse embryonic stem cells (Micallef et al. 2005, Shi et al. 2005) and to induce pancreatic differentiation in human embryonic stem cells (D'Amour et al. 2006, Johannesson et al. 2009). In the experiment described herein, consistent with the previous observations, it is shown showed that RA induces expression of PDX1.",
                        "In the last step both ductal and endocrine phenotypes were present and this is probably because the activation of Pdx1 in the second step of the protocol, subsequently activated both the endocrine and the non-endocrine pathways. Pdx1 is well known for controlling early whole pancreas development.",
                        "The inventors believe, although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, that a selected stem cell population from rat whole bone marrow highly expressing nestin could be a potential multipotent precursor stem cell able to differentiate to pancreatic cell lineage. This belief was based on the evidence that nestin is a neuroepithelial marker transiently expressed in early stages in many tissues, including pancreas, and that nestin-positive cells from pancreas can be differentiated in culture into endocrine, exocrine, and ductal cells (Zulewski et al. 2001).",
                        "The inventors demonstrated that epigenetic manipulation of n-BMSC, following a specific multistep protocol, can induce expression of transcription factors involved in the early pancreatic and endocrine specification in a step-wise fashion whose timing was consistent with normal pancreas development. Differentiation into a more mature phenotype, including ductal and insulin-producing cells was efficiently induced. It remains to be shown how long these cells remain in this differentiated state both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, the inventors describe a novel cellular system that can address these unmet needs, both for cell therapy and for mechanistic studies and drug discovery in the field of pancreatic islet neogenesis.",
                        "Moreover, the inventors were able to induce reversion of diabetes for genetic modification of bone marrow stem cells using PDX1 and VEGF gene. This is the first time that stem cell from bone marrow expressing VEGF has been used as possible treatment of type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. After transplantation in a diabetic animal model, the inventors observed de novo differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells into \u03b2-cells and for the first time in the literature the inventors report detectable level of human insulin, confirming a successful chimerism and a functional differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells in beta-cells.",
                        "Stem cell therapy may be a desirable alternative to pancreas and pancreatic islet transplantation, and stem cells from bone marrow represent an attractive source. However, the mechanism related to \u03b2-cell recovery required elucidation. Here, for the first time the inventors tested the hypothesis of de novo \u03b2-cell differentiation from hBMSCs versus endogenous \u03b2-cell regeneration mediated by hBMSCs, using the transient expression of PDX1 and VEGF.",
                        "In contrast to previous reports [3,7,8,9,10,11] hBMSCs alone were not able to reverse hyperglycemia in the inventors' animal model. This can be attributed to differences in stem cell populations, mouse strains, mouse models, and experimental designs among research groups. Some studies used hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow [3,32], or mouse mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells [8,9,10,11]. In addition C57BL/6 were used for STZ-induced diabetes model [8,10,11], which can explain different outcomes in response to STZ, degree of diabetes, blood glucose levels and responses to treatment. Only one previous report [7] is the closest to the inventors' study: same type of stem cells, same cell delivery method (intracardiac injection) and same mouse strain. However the dose of STZ used was adjusted to produce nonlethal hyperglycemia and an improvement in blood glucose control was possible only with multiple injections of human cells. The higher glucose level and mortality of the inventors' mice in addition to a single stem cell injection can explain the different results.",
                        "The inventors achieved sustained recovery from diabetes following injection of hBMSCs overexpressing VEGF. The inventors observed an efficient engraftment of hBMSC-VEGF in the pancreas of the diabetic mice, and its successful differentiation into blood vessels and to lesser degree into \u03b2-cells. For the first time, the inventors reported detectable levels of human insulin confirming a successful chimerism in the mouse. However, the sustained near-normoglycemia remission was not fully supported by the low level of human insulin, and the low number of \u03b2-cells from hBMSCs-VEGF. The significantly higher level of mouse insulin in rescued mice suggested that the endogenous \u03b2-cell regeneration was the predominant mechanism behind the sustained clinical recovery. Taken together the de novo intra pancreatic angiogenesis from hBMSC-VEGF along with the endogenous activation of the insulin/IGF receptor signaling pathway strongly support regeneration and functional recovery of endogenous \u03b2-cells.",
                        "To highlight this concept, the inventors performed a parallel experiment using hBMSCs expressing PDX1. The previous report showed the possible direct differentiation of human hBMSCs into \u03b2-cells in vitro after transfection with a virus vector encoding PDX1[17], supporting the possible role of PDX1 to direct the differentiation of hBMSCs into insulin-producing cells in the inventors' in vivo model. Human BMSC-PDX1 could differentiate to \u03b2-cells in the diabetic pancreas with approximately the same efficiency of hBMSC-VEGF confirmed by similar detectable levels of serum human insulin and by immunohistochemistry. However, transplantation of hBMSC-PDX1 into diabetic mice resulted in only transient recovery. The overall efficiency of hBMSC-PDX1 engraftment and their differentiation into blood vessels were significantly lower than that from hBMSC-VEGF, which is correlated with the disparate clinical outcomes. VEGF-A has been known to play a key role in maintaining normal intra-islet vascularization [33,34]. In addition, VEGF is known to enhance proliferation, survival and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [35]. Over expression of VEGF in BMSC increased revascularization and myocardial recovery after injury [36], and neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies inhibited the BMSC-initiated angiogenic response in vivo [37]. Moreover the \u03b2-cell-specific VEGF-A deficient mouse showed the altered insulin secretion despite maintaining a normal \u03b2-cell mass [38] and bone marrow transplantation did not induce expansion of \u03b2-cell mass after STZ-induced diabetes compared with wild-type mice [39]. It has been reported that BMSCs improved revascularization and function of pancreatic islets after transplantation [40]. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can not only promote endogenous angiogenesis [41], but directly differentiate into smooth muscle [42] and endothelial cell phenotypes [43] in vitro, and into functional vascular structures [44,45] and contribute in vivo to myocardial recovery after injury [46].",
                        "The pancreas of the mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF showed upregulation of insulin receptor associated gene, such as Ins1, Igf2, Igfbp1 as well as Dok1, 2 and 3. Recent extensive studies have shown the importance of insulin regulating \u03b2-cell function [47]. The inventors' results showed that Insulin/IGF receptor coupling with insulin receptor soluble (IRS) proteins activated the downstream effector pathway PI-3K. Several gene targets in the PI-3K pathway were upregulated including Adra1d, G6 pc, G6 pc2, and Serpine 1 in the rescued group. In contrast, Grb2, generally thought to affect Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, was significantly downregulated in the rescued mice. Consistent with a previous report [48], the expression of Jun was increased in the diabetic pancreas while it was significantly downregulated in the rescued mice. Insulin/IGF receptor/PI-3K signaling mediates several pathways related to proliferation and anti-apoptosis in most mammalian cells including pancreatic islets [49]. AKT is a critical mediator of the Insulin/IGF receptor/PI-3K pathway and overexpression of active AKT1 in the mouse \u03b2-cells significantly increased \u03b2-cell size and total islet mass [50]. The inventors showed a significant decrease of AKT expression in the pancreatic islets of diabetic mice, compared with control and rescued mice. Interestingly, pattern of AKT distribution was mostly on the cell membrane of the \u03b2-cells of the healthy control mice, while it was highly expressed in both cell membrane and cytoplasm of the \u03b2-cells in the rescued mice. It is well known that AKT activation takes place on the cell membrane [51]. On the other hand, it has been reported that translocation of AKT in the cytoplasm and nucleus after stimulation with growth factors such us insulin and IGF1 could mediate potential anti-apoptotic mechanisms [52,53]. Activation of Insulin/IGF signaling through PI-3K/ATK pathway could induce reduction of apoptosis by cytoplasmic sequestration of BAD that prevents BCL2 activation and subsequently caspase activation. Thus a reduced phosphorylation of BAD in diabetic pancreas is consistent with increased apoptosis [54]. The inventors' data also showed increased apoptosis in the diabetic mouse pancreas measured by the increased number of \u03b2-cells expressing caspase 3 cleaved. Accordingly, diabetic mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF showed a significant reduction in apoptosis.",
                        "In keeping with the observation of enhanced insulin/PI-3K/AKT signaling, the pancreatic islets of the rescued mice showed greater expression and nuclear localization of PDX1 compared with diabetic mice. PDX1 is a downstream transcriptional target of insulin signaling and it is required for \u03b2-cell growth and differentiation [27]. Moreover the expression level of p27Kip1, a cell cycle inhibitor known to be negatively regulated by PI-3K/AKT pathway in \u03b2-cells through FoxO1[31] and Gsk-3\u03b2[30], was significantly reduced in the rescued group while up-regulated in control and diabetic pancreatic islets. This finding confirmed the increased proliferative signal in the rescued pancreatic islets through the Insulin receptor/PI-3K/ATK pathway, compared with both control healthy mice and diabetic mice.",
                        "In addition, PI-3K signaling is also known to modulate VEGF expression in the endothelial cells and to induce angiogenesis [29] though v-Src [55]. Moreover, VEGF expression is predominant in the pancreatic \u03b2-cells and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is highly expressed in the intra-islets capillary [20]. The inventors' data showed a dramatic increase in VEGF expression in the \u03b2-cells of rescued mice compared with diabetic mice, implying the possible activation of VEGF expression via PI-3K/AKT pathway.",
                        "Taking together, the inventors' results suggest that hBMSCs-VEGF induce reversion of diabetes mainly by induction of endogenous \u03b2-cell regeneration through the generation of a favorable microenvironment and through the activation of the insulin/IGF1/PI-3K/AKT pathway. Activation of this pathway in the \u03b2-cells improves cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis and induces \u03b2-cell differentiation and proliferation through activation of PDX1 expression and inhibition of P27Kip1. In addition, the inventors provide evidence of a possible new mechanism of \u03b2-cell recovery/regeneration through modulation of intra-islet angiogenesis. The activation of the insulin/IGF signaling through the PI-3K pathway in the diabetic mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF induces VEGF expression in the \u03b2-cells and correlated with \u03b2-cell recovery (FIG. 8F).",
                        "In conclusion, the inventors' work provides new insight into the mechanism of \u03b2-cell recovery after injury mediated by hBMSC therapy and demonstrates the th ability to use hBMSC expressing VEGF for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes.",

In the first step the cells were exposed to 5-AZA for 24 h and TSA for another 24 h. The dose of 5-AZA used in this study has been successfully used by Lefebvre et al. (2009) to induce NGN3 expression and endocrine differentiation into the PANC-1 human ductal cell line. The inventors determined the optimal concentrations of TSA by testing cell survival, growth and death with increasing doses from 10 nM to 1 mM. Concentrations of more than 100 nM for TSA showed an increased cell death and reduced differentiation capability (data not shown). The inventors rationalized that chromatin remodeling is the first step to induce nestin-positive cells because of putative cell lineage differences and specification, and believed that the increased \u2018susceptibility\u2019 of chromatin by serial epigenetic modifications will enhance the induction and further direct differentiation toward the pancreatic phenotype (FIG. 9). After exposure to TSA, the cells were cultured for 7 days in a serum-free medium containing ITS and RA (FIG. 9C, induction). The concentration of RA adopted in this study was previously optimized in embryonic stem cell differentiation model (Cai et al. 2009). Recently, the role of RA in pancreatic development and early endocrine lineage determination has been shown (Ostrom et al. 2008). In addition, RA has been used for both mouse and human embryonic stem cells to induce differentiation into pancreatic cell lineage (Micallef et al. 2005, Johannesson et al. 2009). At this time point the inventors were able to highly induce the expression of a pancreatic master gene (pancreas duodenum homeobox-1, PDX1), together with other genes important in the early pancreatic development (PAX6 and NGN3). Many cells were positive for PDX1 as assayed by immunohistochemistry (FIG. 10F). Subsequently, the PDX1-positive cell population dramatically decreased after 7 days during the third step (differentiation; FIG. 10G) but increased again and became prominent in the fourth step (maturation; FIG. 10H). This fluctuation of PDX1-positive cell population by immunohistochemistry also appeared in the qRT-PCR analysis in sequential manner (FIG. 11B). Pdx1 gene expression was initiated within 7 days during the second step culture (induction), then downregulated several fold but was detectable \u02dc2 weeks later during the third step, and upregulated again 3 weeks later during the maturation step. Ngn3 transcript was induced at day 7 and progressively increased two- to fivefold at day 14 (step 3) and day 21 (step 4) respectively (FIG. 11). Only a few cells were positive for PAX6 at day 9, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry (FIG. 10) and the number of positive cells strongly increased during step 3, but was not detectable at step 4. Surprisingly, these results were consistent with the physiological expression of PDX1, PAX6, and NGN3 genes during in vivo pancreas development. In contrast, nestin expression was high in the beginning of the differentiation and dramatically decreased to an undetectable level during the second stage of conditioning. This was confirmed by both immunohistochemistry and (FIG. 10A-D) and qRT-PCR (Table 2). Morphologically, the cells stayed aggregated in spheroid structure.",
                                "In the third stage of conditioning the inventors used poly-Lornithine-coated dishes with a medium containing high glucose with both bFGF and EGF. In such an environment, the cells underwent further differentiation into a pancreatic phenotype. At about 2 weeks of the differentiation process, corresponding to the maximized expression of PAX6, increased expression of NGN3 and downregulation of PDX1, endocrine markers for a more mature phenotype started to appear as confirmed by qRT-PCR: insulin, glucagon, and glucose transporter 2 (Glut2; Table 2). The expression of Ck19, a ductal marker, was also induced. At this stage immunohistochemistry was negative for the same markers (FIG. 12).",
                                "In the last step, the inventors tried to further push the differentiation toward a more mature phenotype. For this reason the inventors used nicotinamide for about 7 days. At day 21 from the beginning of the in vitro differentiation, a mixed population of cells expressing endocrine and ductal phenotypes were observed. Immunofluorescent staining was markedly positive for insulin and CK19 (FIG. 12). These cells also positively stained with the zinc chelator, DTZ, indicating the presence of intracellular proinsulin, as has been previously observed for \u2018pseudoislets\u2019 in culture (Kuo et al. 1992). Only a small number of cells were positive for glucagon with immunofluorescent staining (data not shown). Insulin, CK19, and glucagon transcripts were also consistently upregulated (seven- to eightfold, five- to sixfold and two- to threefold, respectively; FIGS. 13A and 13B). No amylase was detected on immunohistochemistry (data not shown) and RNA levels (Table 2), indicating the absence of a pancreatic exocrine phenotype. In this culture condition the inventors also failed to detect somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide-positive cells (Table 2).",
                                "RNA from n-BMSC was extracted at different time points during in vitro differentiation and analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR for transcripts encoding pancreatic transcription factors and the four islet hormones. Values represent cycle threshold\u00b1S.D. PP, pancreatic polypeptide. hormones. Values represent cycle threshold\u00b1S.D. PP, pancreatic polypeptide.",
                                "To evaluate the functionality of differentiated cells, the inventors tested for glucose-induced insulin secretion in vitro. At the end of the last differentiation stage, the cell aggregate (spheroids) not only produced insulin, but also displayed a glucoseresponsive secretion of the hormone. Insulin secretion was dose-dependent after incubation for 1 h with glucose (5, 10, and 20 mM; FIG. 13C). Spheroids incubated on ice under the same condition did not show glucose-responsive insulin secretion. The average insulin secretion on ice with glucose 5, 10, and 20 mM was 0.85\u00b10.32, 1.5\u00b10.41, and 1.8\u00b10.5 ng/100 spheroids per hour respectively. This is consistent with inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release by cooling (Atwater et al. 1984). These findings demonstrate de novo synthesis and processing of insulin and physiologically regulated secretion. Moreover the cells expressed a functional element, Glut2 (FIGS. 13A and 13B) that allows the rapid entry of glucose into the cells. This confirmed the capability of the inventors' differentiated cells to respond to glucose stimulation.",

After 24 hr in culture, non-adherent cells were separated from adherent cells. The adherent cells were washed with PBS and cultured with the previous medium for 5-7 days. At 80% confluences the cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and plated in two 100-cm2 dishes (passage 1). Cell underwent two further expansions before aliquots were storage in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO and frozen in \u221280\u00b0 C. Until passage 6-7 the cells were growing with doubling time of 48 hrs. All the experiments were performed using a single batch of hBMSCs from a single donor. The cells were used within passage 7. Human BMSCs from passage #3 to 6 were analyzed for various cell surface markers commonly used for the positive and negative detection of mesenchymal stem cells by flow cytometry analysis (CD44, CD31, CD34, and CD 105).

For immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin embedded samples, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through ethanol baths and PBS, followed by rinsing in distilled water for 5 min. Pancreatic sections were stained in Harris hematoxylin solution (Sigma) and eosin Y solution (Sigma). For immunofluorescent staining, antigen retrieval was performed by heating at 90\u00b0 C. in antigen retrieval buffer (DAKO).

                                "To evaluate the possible contribution of hBMSC-VEGF to the recovery of \u03b2-cells and whether the reversion of diabetes was secondary to a direct differentiation of hBMSC to \u03b2-cells or secondary to endogenous \u03b2-cell regeneration, the inventors measured both mouse and human serum insulin. Only the mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF had significantly higher level of mouse insulin compared with that of diabetic mice and diabetic mice treated with hBMSC or hBMSC-PDX1 (FIG. 6A). However, more than half of the mice treated with hBMSC-VEGF and hBMSC-PDX1 (5 out of 9 and 5 out of 8, respectively), showed low but detectable level of human insulin, confirming de novo human BMSC differentiation into functional \u03b2-cells (FIG. 6B). The levels of total serum insulin were significantly higher in the mice treated with hBMSC-VEGF and hBMSC-PDX1 compared with the diabetic mice and the diabetic mice treated with hBMSC (FIG. 6C). The result showed clear correlation between the level of insulin and the number of \u03b2-cells, which was again higher in the mice treated with hBMSC-VEGF and hBMSC-PDX1 than two other groups (FIG. 6D). In addition, even unrescued groups of mice from hBMSC-VEGF and hBMSC-PDX1 with persistent hyperglycemia demonstrated significantly higher levels of total serum insulin and numbers of endogenous \u03b2-cells compared with other groups resulting in the overall better clinical outcomes. However, the group of mice with sustained near-normoglycemia remission, treated with hBMSC-VEGF, had the highest level of mouse insulin and \u03b2-cell numbers among the groups, suggesting that sustained reversion of diabetes was secondary to endogenous \u03b2-cell regeneration or recovery rather than transplant-derived \u03b2-cell differentiation.",
                                "**Endogenous \u03b2-Cell Recovery in Mouse Rescued by hBMSC-VEGF was Secondary to Activation of Insulin/IGF Signaling Pathway**",
                                "To evaluate the possible mechanism of endogenous \u03b2-cell recovery mediated by hBMSC-VEGF in the rescued mice the inventors compared the PCR array data of the pancreases from the healthy and diabetic age matched control mice. The inventors noted a clear trend of decreasing expression of mouse genes related with insulin receptor signaling pathway in pancreases of the diabetic mice compared with the healthy control (FIG. 7A). In the STZ-induced diabetic mice group, there was a significant decrease in expression of Insulin1, as expected. In addition, a significant decrease in gene expression of Excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency 1 (Ercc1), Glucokinase (Gck), and Acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (ACACA) with an increased expression of Jun. However, mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF showed a similar PCR-array profile as seen in the healthy control mice without significant changes in gene expression (FIG. 7B). Interestingly, PCR array of the diabetic mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF showed the significant up-regulation of the mouse genes involved in the insulin/IGF signaling pathway as compared to the diabetic mice (FIG. 7C). In particular, insulin was significantly upregulated in the rescued mice while it was downregulated in the STZ-induced diabetes mice as compared to the healthy control. Insulin receptor associate protein such as insulin growth factor 2 (IGF2), insulin growth factor binding protein 1 (Igfbp1), and Dok3 were significantly upregulated in the rescued mice. All target genes for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway such as Adrenergic receptor alpha1d (Adra1d), glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic (G6 pc), glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic, 2(G6pc2), and Serpine 1 were also upregulated while Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2B, subunit 1 (Eif4ebp1), Growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2) and Jun were significantly downregulated as compared to the diabetic mice (FIG. 7C).",
                                "To further explore the molecular mechanisms for the reversion of diabetes and \u03b2-cell recovery/regeneration in diabetic mice treated with hBMSC-VEGF, pancreatic islets from control healthy mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice, and diabetic mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF were examined using high resolution confocal imaging to assess insulin/IGF receptor/PI3-K downstream proteins. AKT protein was highly expressed in the pancreatic islets of healthy mice mostly on the plasma membranes (FIG. 8A, upper panel) while dramatically reduced in diabetic condition (FIG. 8A, intermediate panel). Interestingly, after injection of hBMSC-VEGF, pancreatic islets of rescued mice showed upregulation of AKT expression with distribution not only in the plasma membrane but also strongly in the cytoplasm (FIG. 8A, lower panel). Activation of insulin/IGF receptor/PI-3K/AKT pathway is associated to increase \u03b2-cell mass though activation of downstream proteins required for \u03b2-cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, such as PDX1 [27,28] and P27Kip1 [29,30]. Associated with preservation and/or regeneration of \u03b2-cell number and insulin secretion, mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF showed a strong nuclear localization of PDX1 (FIG. 8B lower panel) similar to the control mice (FIG. 8B upper panel). In contrast PDX1 was detected in less \u03b2-cell nuclei of the diabetic mice (FIG. 8B, intermediate panel), with a staining that appears to be weaker. In addition, virtually all \u03b2-cell nuclei of the control mice were positive for p27Kip1 (FIG. 8C, upper panel), a cell cycle inhibitor protein negatively regulated through the PI-3K/AKT pathway. This is consistent with the slow \u03b2-cell replication in postnatal life [31]. After induction of diabetes most \u03b2-cell nuclei were positive for p27Kip1 (FIG. 8C, intermediate panel), suggesting a persistent inhibition of \u03b2-cell replication. In contrast the inventors detected a markedly decrease in immunostaining for p27Kip1 protein in the pancreatic islets of mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF, with only isolated positive nuclei (FIG. 8C, lower panel), consistent with activation of \u03b2-cell replication.",
                                "The inventors next measured caspase 3 cleaved (c-CASP3) to \u03b2-cell assess apoptosis in relation to activation of the Insulin receptor/PI-3K/AKT pathway. Pancreatic islets from diabetic mice showed a dramatic increase in c-CASP3 compared with control and rescued mice (FIG. 8D), and the percent of c-CASP3-positive \u03b2-cells in diabetic mice rescued by hBMSC-VEGF was significantly lower compared to the diabetic mice and similar to the healthy control mice (FIG. 8E). This is consistent with anti-apoptotic signal mediated by activation of PI-3K pathway (FIG. 8F)."

        "17. The method of claim 15, wherein administering is via intra-hepatic or subcutaneous transplantation.",
        "18. The method of claim 15, wherein the insulin-producing cell is an insulin-producing \u03b2-cell or a \u03b2-islet cell.",
        "19. The method of claim 16, wherein producing the pancreatic precursor cell or an insulin-producing cell from the bone marrow is by:\nproducing a nestin-positive bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) from the bone marrow;\nculturing the nestin-positive BMSC in a first culture medium for chromatin remodeling by contacting the cell with 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and contacting the cell with trichostatin (TSA);\nculturing the cell in a second culture medium for cell induction;\nculturing the cell in a third culture medium to differentiate the cell;\nculturing the cell in a forth culture medium to mature the cells into a pancreatic precursor cell or an insulin-producing beta-cell.",
