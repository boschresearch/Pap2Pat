# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Definitions

### Activation of Mitochondrial Uncoupling has Beneficial Effects

### Methods and Compositions for Activating Mitochondrial Uncoupling

### Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

### Loss of the Repressive Arm of the Transcriptional Circadian Clock Extended Lifespan Independent of Dietary Protein Restriction and Reduced Insulin-like Signaling

### Period Mutants Exhibited a High Metabolic Rate Due to Mitochondrial Uncoupling

### Endogenous Uncoupling Protein UCP4C was Necessary for Period Mutant Lifespan Extension and Sufficient to Extend Wild-Type Lifespan

### Lifespan Extension was Mediated by Loss of Per Specifically in the Intestine
