                        "Nearly all animals exhibit behavior and physiologies that are tightly linked to a 24-hour circadian rhythm, controlled by endogenous circadian clocks. These clocks are composed of transcriptional feedback loops that regulate the expression of genes controlling diverse cellular functions. In Drosophila, the circadian transcriptional activators Clock and Cycle induce the oscillating expression of hundreds of target genes, including period (per) and timeless (tim), which encode repressors of Clock and Cycle activity (FIG. 1A). Because animals lose circadian rhythmicity as they age, it has long been hypothesized that loss of circadian regulation contributes to aging and limits lifespan. Specifically, there has been interest in the impact of circadian-regulated metabolism on lifespan and aging, as many mechanisms known to regulate organismal lifespan involve large metabolic changes, including many metabolism genes regulated by the circadian clock (Brown, 2016; Panda, 2016). Most reports investigating core molecular clock components and lifespan have examined the circadian transcriptional activators (i.e., Clock or Cycle) and found that disruption of these activators leads to detrimental metabolic function and shortened lifespan (Dubrovsky et al., 2010; Vaccaro et al., 2017). Studies involving loss of circadian transcriptional repressors (i.e., Period, Timeless, or the light receptor Cryptochrome) and the resulting influence on metabolism, healthspan, and lifespan have been more controversial (Ulgherait et al., 2016; Vaccaro et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016a). While a number of studies have focused on the detrimental effects of loss of the transcriptional repressor mPer2 in the mouse (Lee et al., 2010), there is also evidence that loss of mPer2 in the whole organism, or in individual tissues, may have beneficial effects on specific aspects of healthspan and lifespan (Wang et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2016b). For example, loss of mPer2 in the whole mouse has been associated with increased metabolic rate, lowered fat storage, increased leptin levels, and decreased insulin resistance compared to control animals, indicating the possibility of a favorable metabolic state under ad libitum feeding conditions (Grimaldi et al., 2010). The specific mechanisms underlying circadian-regulated metabolism and their roles in aging and longevity have up to now remained unclear."

                                "Vectors typically comprise the DNA of a transmissible agent, into which foreign DNA is inserted. A common way to insert one segment of DNA into another segment of DNA involves the use of enzymes called restriction enzymes that cleave DNA at specific sites (specific groups of nucleotides) called restriction sites. A \u201ccassette\u201d refers to a DNA coding sequence or segment of DNA that codes for an expression product that can be inserted into a vector at defined restriction sites. The cassette restriction sites are designed to ensure insertion of the cassette in the proper reading frame. Generally, foreign DNA is inserted at one or more restriction sites of the vector DNA, and then is carried by the vector into a host cell along with the transmissible vector DNA. A segment or sequence of DNA having inserted or added DNA, such as an expression vector, can also be called a \u201cDNA construct.\u201d A common type of vector is a \u201cplasmid\u201d, which generally is a self-contained molecule of double-stranded DNA, usually of bacterial origin, that can readily accept additional (foreign) DNA and which can readily be introduced into a suitable host cell. A plasmid vector often contains coding DNA and promoter DNA and has one or more restriction sites suitable for inserting foreign DNA. Coding DNA is a DNA sequence that encodes a particular amino acid sequence for a particular protein or enzyme. Promoter DNA is a DNA sequence which initiates, regulates, or otherwise mediates or controls the expression of the coding DNA. Promoter DNA and coding DNA may be from the same gene or from different genes and may be from the same or different organisms. A large number of vectors, including plasmid and fungal vectors, have been described for replication and/or expression in a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts, and many appropriate host cells, are known to those skilled in the relevant art. Recombinant cloning vectors will often include one or more replication systems for cloning or expression, one or more markers for selection in the host, e.g. antibiotic resistance, and one or more expression cassettes.",

A nucleotide sequence typically carries genetic information, including the information used by cellular machinery to make proteins and enzymes. These terms include double or single stranded genomic and cDNA, RNA, any synthetic and genetically manipulated polynucleotide, and both sense and anti-sense polynucleotide. This includes single- and double-stranded molecules, i.e., DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA hybrids, as well as \u201cprotein nucleic acids\u201d (PNA) formed by conjugating bases to an amino acid backbone. This also includes nucleic acids containing modified bases, for example thio-uracil, thio-guanine and fluoro-uracil.",

The nucleic acids may also be modified by many means known in the art. Non-limiting examples of such modifications include methylation, \u201ccaps\u201d, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, and internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoroamidates, carbamates) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates). Polynucleotides may contain one or more additional covalently linked moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine), intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen), chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, iron, oxidative metals), and alkylators. The polynucleotides may be derivatized by formation of a methyl or ethyl phosphotriester or an alkyl phosphoramidate linkage. Furthermore, the polynucleotides herein may also be modified with a label capable of providing a detectable signal, either directly or indirectly.

Thus, the activator of mitochondrial uncoupling must be in the appropriate form for administration of choice. It has been shown herein that the activation of mitochondrial uncoupling in the intestine is sufficient to extend lifespan, decrease or suppress cellular proliferation as well as restoring intestinal health and homeostasis. Thus, preferred modes of administration would include those that deliver the agent to the intestines, including but not limited to oral and rectal administration.",

The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d refers to molecular entities and compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction, such as gastric upset, dizziness and the like, when administered to a human, and approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. \u201cCarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as saline solutions in water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. A saline solution is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.",

Tablets or hard gelatin capsules may comprise lactose, starch or derivatives thereof, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, stearic acid or salts thereof. Soft gelatin capsules may comprise vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid, or liquid polyols. Solutions and syrups may comprise water, polyols, and sugars. An active agent intended for oral administration may be coated with or admixed with a material that delays disintegration and/or absorption of the active agent in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the sustained release may be achieved over many hours and if necessary, the active agent can be protected from degradation within the stomach. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be formulated to facilitate release of an active agent at a particular gastrointestinal location due to specific pH or enzymatic conditions.",

Other components which may be present in such compositions include water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine, and vegetable oils. Compositions adapted for parental administration may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile carrier, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.",

The present composition may be administered in a local or systemic manner, for example, via injection directly into the desired target site, e.g., in a depot or sustained release formulation. The composition may be administered in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in liposomes or nanoparticles coated with tissue-specific or cell-specific ligands/antibodies. The liposomes or nanoparticles will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the desired tissue or cells, e.g., tumor cells.",
                                "The formation and use of liposomes are generally known to those of skill in the art. Recently, liposomes were developed with improved serum stability and circulation half-times (U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,516). Further, various methods of liposome and liposome like preparations as potential drug carriers have been described (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,434; 5,552,157; 5,565,213; 5,738,868; and 5,795,587).",

In addition, several successful clinical trials examining the effectiveness of liposome-mediated drug delivery have been completed.",
                                "Liposomes are formed from phospholipids that are dispersed in an aqueous medium and spontaneously form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles (also termed multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). MLVs generally have diameters of from 25 nm to 4 \u03bcm. Sonication of MLVs results in the formation of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with diameters in the range of 200 to 500\u212b, containing an aqueous solution in the core.",
                                "Alternatively, nanocapsule or nanoparticle formulations may be used. Nanocapsules can generally entrap substances in a stable and reproducible way. NPs are colloidal carriers that can have a natural or synthetic origin and can vary from 1 to 1000 nm in size. Synthetic NPs may be prepared from polymeric materials such as poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), poly(alkylcyanoacrylates), poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM), poly(\u03f5-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyesters (poly(lactic acid) (PLA), or from inorganic materials such as gold, silicon dioxide (silica), among others. These carriers can transport drugs by adsorbing, entrapping or bounding covalently to them. Natural NPs are produced from natural polymers, such as polysaccharides (chitosan and alginate), amino acids (poly(lysine), poly(aspartic acid) (PASA)), or proteins (gelatin and albumin). Natural NPs have the advantage of providing biological signals to interact with specific receptors/transporters expressed by endothelial cells.",

Such factors include the particular form of the inhibitor, and its pharmacokinetic parameters such as bioavailability, metabolism, and half-life, which will have been established during the usual development procedures typically employed in obtaining regulatory approval for a pharmaceutical compound. Further factors in considering the dose include the condition or disease to be treated or the benefit to be achieved in a normal individual, the body mass of the patient, the route of administration, whether the administration is acute or chronic, concomitant medications, and other factors well known to affect the efficacy of administered pharmaceutical agents. Thus, the precise dose should be decided according to the judgment of the person of skill in the art, and each patient's circumstances, and according to standard clinical techniques.",

                                "To investigate how loss of specific circadian regulators influence aging, the lifespans of four established arrhythmic Drosophila mutants (FIG. 1A): three genomic mutants, cycle (cyc01); period (per01); and timeless (tim01); and flies ubiquitously expressing a dominant-negative form of Clock (DN-Clock) (Tanoue et al. 2004) were investigated. Consistent with other reports, functional disruption of the circadian transcriptional activators Cycle or Clock shortened lifespan relative to controls (specifically males, FIGS. 1B, 1C) (Dubrovsky et al. 2010; Vaccaro et al. 2017). In contrast, functional disruption of the circadian transcriptional repressors Per and Tim significantly increased lifespan (15-20%) relative to controls; this appeared to be a male-specific effect (FIGS. 1D, 1E). To confirm that this lifespan extension was due to the loss of Per protein, Per expression was restored using the UAS-GAL4 system (Brand and Perrimon 1993). Expressing either of two independent period transgenes using either the timeless-GAL4 driver or the ubiquitin-GAL4 driver in the per01 null background reverted per mutant lifespan to that of control animals (FIGS. 1F, 1G). Thus, loss of Per expression extends lifespan.",
                                "The classic method of lifespan extension is dietary restriction (DR). It has been previously shown by the inventors that per01 and tim01 mutants are not naturally diet-restricted\u2014that is, these mutants eat more, not less, than controls (Allen et al. 2016; see also FIG. 2A). However, loss of Per and Tim might mimic physiological changes associated with DR. If so, DR should not further extend the lifespan of male per01 and tim01 mutants. In Drosophila, DR-mediated lifespan extension was accomplished by titration of protein (yeast extract). To test their response to DR, per01 and tim01 null mutants and controls were fed four different concentrations of yeast extract (YE): 0.01% (low), 0.5% (DR), 3% (standard), and 10% (high). As showed previously for female per01 and tim01 mutants (Ulgherait et al. 2016), male per01 and tim01 mutants exhibited DR-induced lifespan extensions similar to controls and lived longer than controls on most dietary protein concentrations (FIGS. 1H, 1I). The lifespan of these circadian mutants was similar to that of control animals only at very high yeast concentrations (10%), which shortens lifespan. Thus, the extended longevity of per01 mutants appeared to be independent of dietary restriction.",
                                "It was next tested if per01 mutants exhibited canonical changes in DR-associated mechanisms of longevity, including: decreased insulin signaling, measured by decreased phosphorylation of Akt protein (p-Akt); decreased TOR signaling, measured by decreased phosphorylation of S6K; and increased autophagy, measured by increased lipidation of Atg8. Surprisingly, per01 males were atypical for all of these hallmarks of longevity and, at some points in the circadian cycle, exhibited the opposite phenotype as predicted for long-lived mutants (FIG. 1J).",
                                "Genetic manipulations were used to further determine if inhibition of TOR signaling or inhibition of insulin-like-signaling (ILS) are responsible for the longevity of per01 mutants. To test inhibition of TOR signaling, TORCl signaling in adulthood was ubiquitously suppressed by inducible (RU486-mediated) overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the downstream kinase S6K, which is known to extend lifespan (Kapahi et al. 2004). Inhibition of TORCl signaling extended the lifespans of both control animals and per01 mutants to a similar magnitude (FIG. 1K), suggesting that the longevity of per01 mutants was independent of TORCl inhibition. Feeding RU486 to either controls or per01 mutants lacking the UAS-transgene had no influence on lifespan (FIG. 1L).",
                                "To test inhibition of insulin-like-signaling, partial genetic ablation of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the fly brain was performed using the pro-apoptotic gene reaper (Broughton et al. 2005). This extended the lifespans of both control animals and per01 mutants to a similar magnitude (FIG. 1M), suggesting that per01-associated lifespan extension is independent of insulin-like signaling inhibition.",

To determine if increased oxidative phosphorylation caused this increased metabolic output, flies were fed sub-lethal doses of mitochondrial complex inhibitors: rotenone, which blocks complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, or oligomycin, which blocks complex V, the F0F1 ATP synthase. While these compounds inhibited the CO2 output of both control and per01 animals to a similar degree, per01 flies still had higher respiration rates than controls (FIG. 2H). This suggested that their increased respiration is actually independent of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and instead implicated a different mitochondrial function, such as mitochondrial uncoupling, as the underlying mechanism.",
                                "Mitochondrial uncoupling increases respiration due to dissipation of the proton gradient and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP synthesis, creating futile cycles of respiration and generating heat, as in mammalian brown fat. To test the effects of mitochondrial uncoupling on respiration, per01 mutants and control flies were fed two different mitochondrial uncoupling compounds: DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol), a proton ionophore that dissipates the proton gradient; and stearic acid, which induces mitochondrial uncoupling by activating endogenous uncoupling protein (UCP) activity. Treatment with either drug increased the respiration of control flies to levels similar to those of per01 mutants but did not increase the respiration of per01 mutants (FIG. 2H). These results suggested that the increased respiration of per01 mutants was due to increased mitochondrial uncoupling and that per01 mutants may already be maximally uncoupled.",

Mitochondria from per01 mutants and controls were purified and measured for O2 consumption. per01 mutant mitochondria exhibited increased O2 consumption by electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I, II, and IV (FIG. 2I). This increased O2 consumption was not due to increased mitochondrial ETC protein abundance or increased enzymatic activity (FIGS. 2J and 2K). Instead, per01 mitochondria exhibited two critical hallmarks of mitochondrial uncoupling relative to control mitochondria: increased leak respiration, measured by higher oxygen consumption after oligomycin treatment (FIG. 2L); and decreased membrane potential, or disrupted proton gradient, measured by the membrane potential dye sensor JC-1, both during steady-state ATP generation and after inhibition by oligomycin (FIG. 2M).",

Like many animals, Drosophila can undergo mitochondrial uncoupling by induction of uncoupling proteins (UCPs), including UCP4A, B and C (Da-Re et al. 2014). Of these, expression of Ucp4B and Ucp4C was found to be circadian-regulated in control flies and constitutively high in per01 mutants (FIGS. 3A-C). To test the role of UCPs in the metabolic phenotype observed in per01 mutants, expression of both UCP4B/C proteins was disrupted using a mutant containing a piggyBac transposon in the intergenic region between these two closely linked Ucp4 genes. Inhibition of UCP4B/C expression reverted all of the mitochondrial uncoupling phenotypes of per01 mutants to control levels: mitochondrial leak respiration (FIG. 3D); mitochondrial membrane potential (FIG. 3E); mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (FIG. 3F); and whole-animal cold shock recovery rates (FIG. 3G). Inhibition of UCP4B/C expression not only reverted mitochondrial uncoupling but also reverted per01 lifespan to that of controls, suggesting that mitochondrial uncoupling caused the lifespan extension (FIG. 3H). To inhibit uncoupling proteins by an orthogonal mechanism, RNAi-mediated knockdown of UCP4A, B, and C in adulthood was performed throughout the whole body in both per01 mutants and controls. Consistent with the mutant analysis, knockdown of UCP4B or C, but not UCP4A, reverted per01 lifespan to that of control animals (FIGS. 3I-3K). Thus, Ucp4B/C expression is necessary for the longevity and metabolic phenotypes of per01 mutants.",

Flies overexpressing UCP4C showed mitochondrial uncoupling phenotypes very similar to per01 mutants: increased mitochondrial leak respiration (FIG. 3L); decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (FIG. 3M); increased CO2 production (FIG. 3N); and faster cold-shock recovery (FIG. 3O). Most importantly, overexpression of UCP4C extended the lifespan of otherwise wild-type flies to the same extent as per01 mutants, with no effect on per01 mutants (FIGS. 3P and 3Q). RU486 feeding alone had no effect on either metabolic or lifespan phenotypes when flies lacked the UAS transgene (results not shown).",

To control for CRISPR-mediated DNA damage, an unrelated gene involved in sperm storage in females (acp98AB) was disrupted (Mueller et al. 2005) using the same inducible GAL4 drivers. acp98AB disruption did not extend lifespan using the any of the tissue-specific drivers (results not shown).

Loss of membrane potential indicates mitochondrial uncoupling. In controls, intestinal mitochondrial membrane potential was indeed circadian-regulated, with higher membrane potential (lower uncoupling) during the day and lower membrane potential (higher uncoupling) at night (FIGS. 5A and 5B). Consistent with loss of circadian regulation, per01 mutants exhibited low mitochondrial membrane potential at both time points, suggesting high levels of mitochondrial uncoupling during both day and night. This phenotype was not due to changes in mitochondrial abundance, as both controls and per01 mutants had similar intestinal mitochondrial populations, as measured by mitoGFP fluorescence (FIGS. 5C and 5D). Thus, mitochondrial uncoupling in the Drosophila intestine is circadian regulated",
                                "Because it was found that ubiquitous UCP4C expression was necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension (FIG. 3), it was next tested whether intestine-specific UCP4C expression is necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension. Similar to per rescue, RNAi-mediated knockdown of UCP4C in the whole intestine or in ISC/EB populations reverted per01 lifespan to that of controls (FIGS. 5E and 5F). Moreover, while overexpression of UCP4C in the nervous system did not alter lifespan (FIG. 5G), constitutive expression of UCP4C in the whole intestine (FIG. 5H) or specifically in ISCs and EBs (FIGS. 5I, 5J) in otherwise wild-type animals lowered mitochondrial membrane potential and extended lifespan. Thus, intestinal UCP4C expression is not only necessary for the lifespan extension of per01 mutants but also sufficient to extend lifespan in otherwise wild-type Drosophila. That is, intestine-specific upregulation of a normally circadian-regulated, oscillating physiological function, mitochondrial uncoupling, extended lifespan.",
                                "**Loss of Period Preserved Intestinal Homeostasis via Increased Mitochondrial Uncoupling and Decreased ROS Levels**",
                                "To understand the underlying mechanism by which mitochondrial uncoupling in the intestine extends lifespan, it was tested if loss of per or intestinal UCP4C overexpression delayed aging-related defects in the intestine. When flies age, they typically lose intestinal barrier function, which is also a major predictor of mortality (Rera et al. 2010; Rera et al. 2011), suggesting that lifespan can be extended by preventing aging-related intestinal barrier dysfunction. Aging-related intestinal barrier dysfunction was tested using the \u201csmurf assay\u201d, named after a children's cartoon, which examines for leakage of an ingested blue dye (Rera et al. 2011; Rera et al. 2012). Consistent with their extended lifespan, old per01 mutants showed a lower percentage of \u201csmurfs\u201d relative to controls, indicating a delay in aging-related intestinal barrier dysfunction (FIG. 6C). Moreover, this maintenance of intestinal integrity observed in per01 mutants depended on intestinal expression of UCP4C and intestinal overexpression of UCP4C alone in otherwise wild-type flies was sufficient to maintain intestinal integrity. Thus, loss of Per and increased mitochondrial uncoupling in the intestine protected against aging-related intestinal dysfunction.",
                                "As aging-related intestinal barrier dysfunction is linked to overproliferation and tissue dysplasia in the gut (Hu and Jasper 2017), it was next tested if loss of per or intestinal UCP4C overexpression delayed aging-related cellular proliferation in the gut. Per protein has previously been shown to regulate intestinal stem cell regeneration during acute intestinal stress (Karpowicz et al. 2013). To measure cellular proliferation in the intestines, aged per01 and control flies were stained for phospho-histone H3 at serine 10 (pHH3), a standard proliferative marker that labels mitotic cells (FIGS. 6A and 6B). Again consistent with delayed aging, per01 mutants showed fewer pHH3 positive cells in the gut relative to control flies. To determine if this phenotype is dependent on mitochondrial uncoupling, UCP4C was knocked down in per01 flies and controls. UCP4C knockdown reverted the number of proliferative cells in per01 flies to the higher levels seen in controls. Moreover, overexpression of UCP4C in otherwise wild-type controls was sufficient to decrease age-related overproliferation of ISCs/EBs. Thus, similar to the smurf assay and consistent with lifespan results, intestinal UCP4C expression was both necessary in per01 mutants and sufficient in otherwise wild-type controls to suppress aging-related intestinal cellular proliferation.",
                                "Intestinal dysfunction and increased aging-related cellular proliferation are closely associated with elevated Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production. ROS can serve as important mitogenic signals in stem cells and their differentiated progeny cells in the fly (Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee 2009); elevated ROS production in the Drosophila intestine is thought to lead to increased misdifferentiation of proliferative cells, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs) (Hochmuth et al. 2011). Because mitochondrial uncoupling can restrict ROS output (Mailloux and Harper 2011), it was hypothesized that uncoupled per01 mutants have extended longevity due to decreased mitochondrial ROS production in the intestine, leading to a decrease in age-related overproliferation of esg-positive (esg+) ISC/EB cells. To test this, the intestines of aged per01 mutants, flies expressing UCP4C constitutively in ISCs and EBs, and controls with MitoSOX Red, were stained with a fluorescent mitochondrial ROS (superoxide) indicator (FIG. 6D). Both per01 mutants and intestinal UCP4C-expressing flies exhibited reduced esg+populations and decreased mitochondrial superoxide production relative to controls in the whole posterior midgut, as well as in ISC/EB populations (FIGS. 6E and 6F).",
                                "Together, these results suggested that loss of Per function and increased mitochondrial uncoupling via increased UCP4C lead to a decrease in ROS levels in the intestine.",

                                "To extend the genetic experiments, pharmacological induction of mitochondrial uncoupling was tested to see if it recapitulates the intestinal phenotypes of per01 mutants and extends lifespan. Low dietary concentrations of the mitochondrial uncoupling compound DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol) or uncoupling-agent/antioxidant beta-hydroxytoluene (BHT) extended the lifespan of wild-type male flies in a dose-dependent manner within a range of physiological concentrations (FIGS. 7A-D) (Caldeira da Silva et al. 2008; Lou et al. 2007). To ensure that these drugs did not cause diet restriction, it was confirmed that DNP or BHT did not decrease feeding rate (FIG. 7E). Additionally, these drugs did not extend the lifespan of per01 mutants, suggesting that these mutants are already receiving the maximal benefit of mitochondrial uncoupling (FIGS. 7F and 7G). DNP feeding also reduced age-related esg+cell overproliferation, mitochondrial ROS output of the entire posterior midgut, and ISC/EB populations (FIGS. 7H and 7I). Thus, pharmacological induction of mitochondrial uncoupling extended lifespan and recapitulated many of the metabolic phenotypes of per01 mutants and UCP4C\u2014expressing flies.",

                                "Changes to ISCs that alter differentiation and result in overproliferation are a common step in cancer development (Zhai et al. 2015). Notch-Delta signaling normally keeps ISCs/EBs at a homeostatic level of differentiation and division and loss of Notch specifically in ISCs and EBs thus leads to high levels of proliferation and the formation of ISC-derived intestinal tumors (Ohlstein and Spradling 2007).",
                                "To test if mitochondrial uncoupling could slow tumor progression in the gut, ISC tumors were induced by suppressing Notch signaling via RNAi, followed by feeding of 2,4 DNP (to induce mitochondrial uncoupling) or vehicle. Dietary 2,4 DNP slowed the progression of ISC tumors (FIG. 7J and 7K) and also extended the shortened lifespan of these animals (FIG. 7L). These results suggested that induction of mitochondrial uncoupling can decrease stem cell overproliferation not only during normal aging but also during induced tumorigenesis."
