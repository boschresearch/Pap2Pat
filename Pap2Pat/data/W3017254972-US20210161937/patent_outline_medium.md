### Loss of the Repressive Arm of the Transcriptional Circadian Clock Extended Lifespan Independent of Dietary Protein Restriction and Reduced Insulin-like Signaling

- investigate how loss of specific circadian regulators influence aging
- show that loss of Per and Tim significantly increases lifespan
- test if loss of Per and Tim mimics physiological changes associated with DR
- test if per01 mutants exhibit canonical changes in DR-associated mechanisms of longevity

### Period Mutants Exhibited a High Metabolic Rate Due to Mitochondrial Uncoupling

- investigate the metabolism of long-lived per01 mutants
- test if per01 mutants have hyperactive metabolic rate
- test if increased oxidative phosphorylation causes increased metabolic output

### Endogenous Uncoupling Protein UCP4C was Necessary for Period Mutant Lifespan Extension and Sufficient to Extend Wild-Type Lifespan
