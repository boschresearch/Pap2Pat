### Loss of the Repressive Arm of the Transcriptional Circadian Clock Extended Lifespan Independent of Dietary Protein Restriction and Reduced Insulin-like Signaling

- investigate how loss of specific circadian regulators influence aging
- test if loss of Per expression extends lifespan

### Period Mutants Exhibited a High Metabolic Rate Due to Mitochondrial Uncoupling

- investigate the metabolism of long-lived per01 mutants

### Endogenous Uncoupling Protein UCP4C was Necessary for Period Mutant Lifespan Extension and Sufficient to Extend Wild-Type Lifespan

- determine if increased mitochondrial uncoupling is required for the lifespan extension of per01 mutants

### Lifespan Extension was Mediated by Loss of Per Specifically in the Intestine

- rescue period expression in different organ systems
- test if loss of per in the intestine is sufficient to extend lifespan
- disrupt period gene in the whole intestine or specifically in ISCs/EBs
- test if loss of per in the intestine is necessary for lifespan extension
- control for CRISPR-mediated DNA damage
