# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- relate to gene engineering, enzyme engineering and fermentation engineering

## BACKGROUND

- introduce L-asparaginase
- describe pharmaceutical and food industry applications
- summarize existing research on L-asparaginase mutants
- discuss limitations of current screening and fermentation methods

## SUMMARY

- introduce screening method for synchronous cell disruption and enzyme activity measurement
- describe construction of mutation library and site-directed mutation
- outline promoter replacement and RBS optimization
- summarize fermentation method and culture medium optimization
- list objectives of the present disclosure

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe preparation of culture media

### EXAMPLE 1

- construct recombinant plasmid pMA5-asnase
- express and verify L-asparaginase gene
- measure enzyme activity

### EXAMPLE 2

- screen mutant strains with high enzyme activity
- analyze and construct mutant plasmid pMA5-S17G/A90S/R156S/K272A-2
- express and measure enzyme activity of mutant strain

### EXAMPLE 3

- construct recombinant plasmid pMA5-S17G/A90S/R156S/K272A
- express and measure enzyme activity of recombinant strain with different promoters

### EXAMPLE 4

- produce L-asparaginate by fermentation in 5 L tank
- optimize fermentation culture medium
- monitor fermentation condition and measure enzyme activity

### EXAMPLE 5

- produce enzyme through fermentation under other strategies
