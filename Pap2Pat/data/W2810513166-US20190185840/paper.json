    "abstract": "L-asparaginase, which catalyses the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to L-aspartate, has attracted the attention of researchers due to its expanded applications in medicine and the food industry. In this study, a novel thermostable L-asparaginase from Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 was cloned and over-expressed in Bacillus subtilis 168. To obtain thermostable L-asparaginase mutants with higher activity, a robust high-throughput screening process was developed specifically for thermophilic enzymes. In this process, cell disruption and enzyme activity assays are simultaneously performed in 96-deep well plates. By combining error-prone PCR and screening, six brilliant positive variants and four key amino acid residue mutations were identified. Combined mutation of the four residues showed relatively high specific activity (3108 U/mg) that was 2.1 times greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. Fermentation with the mutant strain in a 5-L fermenter yielded L-asparaginase activity of 2168 U/mL.",

                "L-asparaginase (EC 3.5.1.1), which catalyses the conversion of L-asparagine to L-aspartate and ammonia, has been identified in various organisms, including animals, plants, yeast, fungi, bacteria, and archaea1\u20133. L-asparaginase has high commercial value due to its vast applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries2,4. In clinical applications, L-asparaginase is used to treat lymphoblastic leukaemia, as it removes the L-asparaginate required for the survival of lymphoblastic leukaemia cells5. To date, L-asparaginases from Erwinia chrysanthemi and Escherichia coli have been used as effective antitumour drugs for the treatment of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia5\u20137. In the food industry, L-asparaginase is used to reduce L-asparagine, which is the precursor of carcinogenic acrylamide8,9. During this process, L-asparaginase is treated at a high temperature together with raw food materials or is sometimes blanched in hot water10\u201312; therefore, the enzyme should be capable of withstanding high temperatures. However, the low activity and instability of L-asparaginase at high temperatures have restricted its application in the food industry.",
                "To effectively apply L-asparaginase industrially, some researchers are using protein engineering methods obtain L-asparaginase mutation with ideal properties. Long et al. identified some key amino acid residues adjacent to the catalytic cavity of L-asparaginase and improved its thermostability and catalytic efficiency via mutagenesis of these residues13. By employing a genetic algorithm in tandem with flexibility studies using molecular dynamics, Offman et al. engineered L-asparaginase with improved activity and resistance to proteolytic cleavage for ideal clinical applications14. Furthermore, Kotzia and Labrou constructed a mutagenesis library via a staggered extension process using L-asparaginase genes from E. carotovora and E. chrysanthemi and then created a new enzyme variant with improved thermal stability via directed evolution15. Regardless of the approach used for mutant construction, an appropriate screening method can simplify the identification process. However, few reports have applied high-throughput screening for L-asparaginase. Instead, some reports have used pH indicator dye-based plate assays to screen for L-asparaginase-producing microorganisms16\u201318. In these methods, the pH increases due to the generation of ammonia when strains secrete L-asparaginase, and a differentiable zone form around the strain on the L-asparagine plate. These methods have been used to screen for extracellular L-asparaginase-producing microbes17. Because the working temperature for thermophile L-asparaginase is greater than 60\u2009\u00b0C19, strains have difficulty growing at that temperature. Thus, the discordant temperature limits the application of these methods for the screening of strains with thermophilic L-asparaginases.",
                "Furthermore, L-asparaginase genes have been widely expressed in many microbial host systems, and a variety of strategies have been used to improve L-asparaginase yields in these strains20. Meena et al. expressed the Streptomyces griseus L-asparaginase gene in E. coli M15, with an enzyme activity of 123 U/mL3. Ferrara et al. used Pichia pastoris as a host to express the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L-asparaginase gene under the control of the AOX1 promoter in a 2-L instrumented bioreactor, with a resultant yield of 85.6\u2009U/mL21. Feng et al. over-expressed the Bacillus subtilis L-asparaginase gene in Bacillus subtilis with the highest yield ever reported in a food-grade host of 407.6 U/mL in a 3-L fermenter after signal peptide screening, promoter mutation, and N-terminal deletion22. Amardeep et al. cloned the E. coli L-asparaginase genes and over-expressed them in E. coli DE3 under the inducible T7 lac promoter. Using the DO-stat fermentation strategy in a 2-L bioreactor, the yield was 870\u2009U/mL at an OD600 of 9023, which was the highest yield ever reported.",
                "In this study, a new thermostable L-asparaginase from Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 was characterized and expressed in B. subtilis 168. To identify thermophilic L- asparaginase mutants with higher activity, a robust high-throughput screening method was developed, and some positive variants were identified. Moreover, through medium optimization and the pH-stat fermentation strategy, a maximum volumetric yield of 2168\u2009U/mL of L-asparaginase was obtained after 36\u2009h of fermentation in a 5-L fermenter."

                        "The relative activity of the P. yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase was determined at 40\u2013100\u2009\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a01a). Additionally, the thermostability was assayed at both the working temperatures (70\u201395\u2009\u00b0C) and storage temperatures (\u221220\u201337\u2009\u00b0C) (Fig.\u00a01c). At temperatures above 85\u2009\u00b0C, the relative L-asparaginase activity was more than 80%, with maximal activity found at 95\u2009\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a01a). This result showed that the P. yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase was thermophilic and that its optimum temperature was higher than that of other thermophilic enzymes (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Compared with the L-asparaginases from mesophilic bacteria, the P. yayanosii CH1 thermophilic L-asparaginase exhibited higher enzyme activity and better thermal stability, although its specific activity was not as high as that of the L-asparaginases from other thermophilic bacteria. However, the thermostability of the P. yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase was higher than that of some thermophilic bacteria, such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Thermococcus zilligii12,30. The enzyme exhibited high stability at both the working temperatures (70\u201395\u2009\u00b0C) and storage temperatures (\u221220\u201337\u2009\u00b0C). L-asparaginase also retained 57%, 50%, 47%, 40%, and 35% of its enzyme activity after 2\u2009h of exposure to temperatures between 70, 80, 85, 90 and 95\u2009\u00b0C respectively (Fig.\u00a01c), with a half-life (t(1/2, 85\u00b0C)) of 105\u2009min at 85\u2009\u00b0C. After storage for one month at \u221220 and 4\u2009\u00b0C, L-asparaginase displayed nearly unaltered activity, although there was a slight decrease in the activity of up to 90% after storage at 20 and 37\u2009\u00b0C for the same period. Analysis of the secondary structure of L-asparaginase using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the 190\u2013250\u2009nm region (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02) and calculating the \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, \u03b2-turn, and random coil proportions by the online server DICHROWEB (Supplementary Table\u00a03) found that the L-asparaginase has abundant \u03b1-helical structure of approximately 42%. Since the secondary structure has reported as an important factor that affects protein thermostability and higher percentage of secondary structured residues known to enhance protein thermostability31\u201333, the abundant \u03b1-helical structure of the L-asparaginase probably contributed to the great thermostability of L-asparaginase.Figure 1Effects of temperature and pH on L-asparaginase activity. (a) The optimal temperature was determined by assaying the activity from 40\u2013100\u2009\u00b0C in 0.05\u2009M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). (b) The influence of the pH on the enzyme activity was investigated by assaying the activity at various pH values at 95\u2009\u00b0C. (c) The enzyme thermostability was determined by incubation at different temperatures for a specified time at pH 7.0, followed by assay of the residual activities. (d) The influence of pH on the enzyme stability was determined by incubating at different pH values at 4\u2009\u00b0C for a specified time and assaying the residual activities.",
                        "Moreover, the enzyme exhibited higher activity under alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions, with a maximum activity observed at pH 8.0 (Fig.\u00a01b). However, no significant difference was found in L-asparaginase activity between pH 7.0 and 10.0, although the enzyme displayed less than 57% relative activity at pH values below 6.0. Therefore, L-asparaginase was relatively unstable under acidic conditions and showed extremely decreased activity at pH 4.0, with no further activity after incubation for 6\u2009h. In contrast, the enzyme was more stable under alkaline conditions, displaying approximately 75% activity after incubation at pH 6\u201310 for 30\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01d). The effects of the temperature and pH on L-asparaginase activity revealed that the enzyme could be used for high temperature alkaline industrial processes due to its stability in both the work and storage environments.",
                        "Some divalent cations are essential cofactors for many catalytic reactions, and their presence may impact these reactions. Furthermore, some L-asparaginases from different sources are sensitive to urea34,35. Therefore, the effects of metal ions and urea on L-asparaginase were examined (Fig.\u00a02). The results showed that L-asparaginase activity was strongly enhanced by Mn2+ (190%) and inhibited by Ni2+ (78%), whereas the addition of other metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ba2+, and Cu2+) had little effect (less than 10%) on L-asparaginase activity (Fig.\u00a02a). L-asparaginase was prone to urea denaturation since it displayed gradually reduced residual activities (86.7%, 67.9%, 60.7%, and 40.1%) after 2\u2009h of incubation in 2, 4, 6, and 8\u2009M urea, respectively (Fig.\u00a02b).Figure 2Effect of metal ions and urea.

                        "Furthermore, the kinetics of L-asparaginase were determined as previously described in the Methods section. The recombinant hydrolysed L-asparagine enzyme had a Michaelis constant Km value of 6.5\u2009mM and a maximum reaction rate Vmax of 2929\u2009\u03bcM/min, which were relatively higher than those of mesophilic bacterial L-asparaginases but lower than those of thermophilic bacterial L-asparaginases9,19,36."

                        "To identify a high-activity thermophilic L-asparaginase variant, we developed a new robust screening method where cell disruption and enzyme activity assays were conducted simultaneously in 96-deep well plates. In this method, the cells were disrupted at high temperature, exposing the L-asparaginase, which was then reacted with Nessler\u2019s reagent to produce a rufous dilute ammonia solution. The measured absorbance at 450\u2009nm on a microplate reader showed the amount of ammonia released during the reaction. The amount of ammonia here was produced not only by the L-asparaginase activity but also by B. subtilis and L-asparagine self-hydrolysis. However, the amount of ammonia formed from B. subtilis and L-asparagine self-hydrolysis was nearly the same between the different wild-type strains and their mutants under the same conditions. Therefore, the difference in the amount of ammonia released was presumed to be due to L-asparaginase activity and thus was used to represent the strain L-asparaginase activity. In comparison to the strain activity of B. subtilis 168/pMA5-pyasnase, we screened positive variants.",
                        "To obtain a mutagenesis library, two rounds of epPCR were performed (Fig.\u00a03a). In every round, 3000 clones were screened. In the first round of screening, 213 positive variants were identified. Among these mutants, A1 (S17G/E72D/N177D), B1 (A90S/I132L/R156S), and C1 (L222V/K272A) were identified with higher L-asparaginase strain activity (Fig.\u00a03b). These three variants were pooled and used as parents for the second round of diversification. Three brilliant positive variants were identified among the 568 positive variants found in the second round of screening. The mutants D2 (S17G/W181F/K272A), E2 (S17G/A90S/R156S/V282S), and F2 (R156S/K272A) showed higher L-asparaginase strain activity than the other mutants. Meanwhile, the relative strain activity of all positive variants from two round of diversification were determined (Fig.\u00a04a). Compared with wild-type, the highest relative strain activity was 1.82 shown by mutant E2. Due to unavoidable errors and existing false positives in the positive variants, the ratio of relative strain activities within 1 to 1.10 folds was more than 20%. Besides that, most of the positive variants had relative strain activity of 1.25 to 1.40.Figure 3Screening for high-activity variants.

                        "To validate the screened strains with high L-asparaginase activity, enzymatic characterization of the six positive mutants was also performed (Table\u00a03). All six mutants showed higher specific activity than the wild-type strain. As shown in Fig.\u00a03b and Table\u00a03, the strain activities of A1, B1, C1, D2, E2, and F2 were 1.40, 1.30, 1.25, 1.70, 1.82, and 1.64-times that of the wild-type strain respectively. Additionally, the specific activities of A1, B1, C1, D2, E2, and F2 were 1.56, 1.45, 1.10, 1.81, 1.95, and 1.68-times those of the wild-type strain respectively. However, the strain activity was not solely consistent with the specific activity but instead revealed trends in specific activity. The strain activity and specific activity indicated that the screening method could effectively identify a high-activity mutant and reveal its activity in a semi-quantitative manner.Table 3The characteristics of L-asparaginase (wild-type) and its mutations.EnzymeSpecific activity (U/mg)Foldt(1/2,85\u00b0C) (min)Optimum temperature (\u00b0C)Optimum pHWild-type1483.81\u2009\u00b1\u200963.611105\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0A12314.50\u2009\u00b1\u200993.121.56105\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0B12145.41\u2009\u00b1\u200978.361.45140\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0C11633.41\u2009\u00b1\u200983.151.10100\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0D22687.4\u2009\u00b1\u200984.111.81110\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0E22899.12\u2009\u00b1\u200997.351.95150\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0F22490.50\u2009\u00b1\u200965.441.68100\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0S17G2556.25\u2009\u00b1\u200988.121.72110\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0A90S1462.3\u2009\u00b1\u200975.330.99150\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0R156S2414.33\u2009\u00b1\u200968.551.62105\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0K272A1889.32\u2009\u00b1\u200959.91.27100\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0S17G/A90S/R156S/K272A3108.43\u2009\u00b1\u2009105.32.10145\u2009\u00b1\u20095958.0The wild-type enzyme in this study was the Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase.",

                        "To find the most significant amino acid residue mutation to improve the relativity strain activity, we sequenced all 880 positive variants and determined the percentage of positive variants with different amino acid residue mutations higher than 5% among all positive variants (Fig.\u00a04b). The percentage of positive variants with S17G, A90S, R156S or K272A amino acid residue mutation were 31%, 28%, 39% and 25%, respectively, which were much higher than the rates of the positive variants without these four residue mutations. Hence, the four mutations (S17G, A90S, R156S and K272A) were analysed, and single point mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis. The enzymatic characterization of the single point mutations is shown in Table\u00a03. The specific activities of S17G (2556 U/mg), R156S (2414.33 U/mg) and K272A (1889.32 U/mg) were higher than those of the wild-type enzyme (1483.81 U/mg), whereas the t(1/2,85\u00b0C) of A90S (150\u2009min) was longer than that of the wild-type (105\u2009min). No significant difference was found in the other enzyme characteristics between the mutants and wild-type. The result indicated that the S17G, R156S and K272A mutants possessed beneficial specific activities, whereas A90S had improved thermostability.",
                        "To verify the effect of mutations on the enzyme, the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures of L-asparaginase were analysed. Circular dichroism analysis of the mutant and wild-type enzymes revealed no significant alterations in the percentages of \u03b1-helices, \u03b2-sheets, \u03b2-turns and random coils (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Table\u00a03), confirming that the increased specific activity and thermostability were not due to the secondary structure. Native-PAGE was used to verify whether the mutation altered the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The native-PAGE bands showed no significant differences in the quaternary structures of the mutant and wild-type enzymes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Thus no mutational alterations occurred.",
                        "Homologous modeling was used to explain the effect of mutations on the enzyme at tertiary structures. The structure from the wild-type L-asparaginase and its mutants were modelled using the crystal structure of Pyrococcus furiosus L-asparaginase (PDB ID: 4Q0M) as a template, with 62.35% identity. SWISS-MODEL showed that the global model quality estimate (GMQE) of this model was 0.85. The VERIFY_3D Server, which was used to check the resulting model, showed that 92.02% of the residues had an average 3D-1D score larger than 0.2, meaning that the model passed the quality check (\u226580% 3D-1D scores larger than 0.2). Therefore, the protein structure model represented the accepted stereochemistry27. These models were used to explain the differences in thermostability and specific activity between L-asparaginase and its respective mutants in terms of the structure using PYMOL. Sequence alignment was used to identify the active domains. Amino acid residues involved in the catalytic mechanism of E. coli L-asparaginase (EcA) were identified previously37. The residues T12, Y25, S58, T89, D90 and K162 of EcA were crucial for the active site and were highly conserved in the Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase, corresponding to T11, Y21, S52 T83, D84 and K154, respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Based on this information, the molecular structure and active regions of Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. The L-asparaginase molecular structure was determined to be a homodimer, with each monomeric subunit consisting of 328 amino acid residues. Each monomer had an active region located at the interface of the other monomer. The mutated residues S17G, R156S, and K272A were located on different flexible loops, and A90S was located on an \u03b1-helix; additionally, the four mutated residues were located around the active domains in the structure space (Figs\u00a05b and 6). Analysis of the molecular structure revealed that residue S17 formed two polar contacts with G20 and one polar contact with V15 and E22. The four residues with active site Y21 were in the same loop (Fig.\u00a06a). S17 and G17 formed no polar contacts with E22. The deficiency of the polar contact with E22 may have contributed to the flexibility of the loop, thereby easing the binding of the substrate and the release of product (Fig.\u00a06b). The S156 mutation had a smaller steric hindrance than R156, and the deficiency of the polar contact with N161 made the loop (residues 155\u2013162) more flexible (Fig.\u00a06c and d), which could have made substrate binding and release of the product occur more smoothly. The effect of the K272A mutation was similar to that of R156S, with both the K272 and A272 residues forming polar contacts with Y21, although A272 had a smaller steric effect than K272 (Fig.\u00a06e and f). During substrate binding and product release with L- asparaginase, the opening and closing of the loop lid around activity site are absolute prerequisite38,39. An incompact structure around activity site may lead to free domains are to reorient spatially in a conformation state making it more accessible to the substrate, thereby increasing the specific activity40. S17G, R156S and K272A were located on the loops around the activity site. The deficiency of polar contact or smaller steric hindrance may have made binding of the substrate easier and product release smoother than in the wild-type. This explains the specific activity was increased after mutations. The \u03b1-helix and the number of hydrogen bond or salt bridge might have contributed to the protein stability31,41,42. The ninetieth residue of L-asparaginase was found in the core of the \u03b1-helix (86\u201396). Further, compare with A90 formed one polar contact with L86 and two polar contacts with S94 (Fig.\u00a06g), S90 formed one polar contact with A87, S91, G149 and formed two polar contacts with L86 and S94 (Fig.\u00a06h). The additional polar contacts may have contributed to the stability of the spatial structure around S90, thereby improving the thermostability of L-asparaginase. The results indicated that the improvement in the activity and thermostability was due to the alteration of the tertiary structures of the mutants.Figure 5The tertiary structure of the P. yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase.

The first feeding was initiated 15\u2009hours into the fermentation, followed by an increase in the pH of the fermentation medium. After 20\u2009h of fermentation, the L-asparaginase activity increased gradually, and autolysis occurred. After 36\u2009h of fermentation, the maximum L-asparaginase activity of 2168\u2009U/mL was obtained, and the intracellular and extracellular activities were 1456\u2009U/mL and 712\u2009U/mL, respectively. After 36\u2009h of fermentation, the intracellular activity rapidly decreased and the extracellular activity increased due to autolysis of the cell.Figure 7Fermentation of B. subtilis 168/pMA5- S17G/A90S/R156S/K272A in 5-L fermentation.

The error bars are based on three biologically independent experiments.",
                        "In previous reports, the highest yield of L-asparaginase activity was 870\u2009U/mL; this activity was achieved when E. coli DE3 was used to overexpress E. coli L-asparaginase and fermentation was performed in a 2-L fermenter. In addition to its high specific activity, the P. yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase mutant had higher thermostability than the E. coli L-asparaginase and hence was resistant to temperature degradation during fermentation. These factors led to the high fermentation yield obtained with the Pyrococcus yayanosii CH1 L-asparaginase."

                "A novel thermostable L-asparaginase from P. yayanosii CH1 was expressed in B. subtilis 168. We also developed a robust new method for screening and identifying high-activity mutants from a mutagenesis library via simultaneous high temperature cell disruption and enzyme activity assays. Using this method, four key mutants with improved activity and thermostability were identified. The specific activity of the combinatorial mutant S17G/A90S/R156S/K272A was 2.1 times greater than that of the wild-type L-asparaginase. Furthermore, fermentation of the mutant yielded L-asparaginase activity of 2168\u2009U/mL, which was the highest reported activity to date, showing high potential for large-scale industrial production of L-asparaginase."
