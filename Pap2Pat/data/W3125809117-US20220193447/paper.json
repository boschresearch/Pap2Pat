    "date": "2021-01-14",
    "abstract": "Many tumour cells show dependence on exogenous serine and dietary serine and glycine starvation can inhibit the growth of these cancers and extend survival in mice. However, numerous mechanisms promote resistance to this therapeutic approach, including enhanced expression of the de novo serine synthesis pathway (SSP) enzymes or activation of oncogenes that drive enhanced serine synthesis. Here we show that inhibition of PHGDH, the first step in the SSP, cooperates with serine and glycine depletion to inhibit one-carbon metabolism and cancer growth. In vitro, inhibition of PHGDH combined with serine starvation leads to a defect in global protein synthesis, which blocks the activation of an ATF-4 response and more broadly impacts the protective stress response to amino acid depletion. In vivo, the combination of diet and inhibitor shows therapeutic efficacy against tumours that are resistant to diet or drug alone, with evidence of reduced one-carbon availability. However, the defect in ATF4-response seen in vitro following complete depletion of available serine is not seen in mice, where dietary serine and glycine depletion and treatment with the PHGDH inhibitor lower but do not eliminate serine. Our results indicate that inhibition of PHGDH will augment the therapeutic efficacy of a serine depleted diet.",

                "Cancer cells adapt their metabolism to support growth and survival, leading to various dependencies and vulnerabilities that could be targeted for therapy1. While these metabolic alterations are dictated by numerous factors, including the genetic alterations in the tumour and the tumour environment or tissue of origin, recent attention has focused on the role of serine metabolism in supporting cancer cell growth2. Serine and glycine (which is produced from serine by the SHMT1/2 reaction) contribute to a number of important processes, including protein, nucleotide and lipid synthesis, the generation of antioxidant defense through glutathione and NADPH synthesis and the provision of one-carbon units for the folate cycle and methylation reactions3. Consequently, cancer cells have been shown to be highly dependent on serine, and antifolates that include dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase inhibitors, have been successfully used as therapeutic drugs4. The earliest example, the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor methotrexate, has been used to treat several different types of cancer including haematological malignancies, breast cancer and osteosarcoma for over 70 years, with newer drugs targeting this pathway under constant development4\u20136. As a non-essential amino acid, serine can be taken up from the extracellular environment or synthesised de novo by cells using the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). Tissue culture experiments have shown that many cancer cells avidly consume serine and depend on an exogenous source of serine for optimal growth7\u201310. However, most cells can adapt to serine starvation by activating flux through the SSP. Serine is an activator of PKM2, the final step in glycolysis, and decreased PKM2 activity under serine depleted conditions allows for the diversion of glycolytic intermediates into the SSP11,12. This response is coordinated with an ATF-4 and histone methyltransferase G9A-dependent activation of the three enzymes of the SSP10,12,13, which allow most cancer cells to survive and continue to proliferate following serine starvation. The efficacy with which cancer cells can adapt to the loss of exogenous serine depends on several factors. Some cancers acquire an amplification or overexpression of PHGDH \u2013 the first step in the SSP \u2013 and these cells tend to be less affected by serine starvation14\u201316. Similarly, activation of oncogenes such as KRAS, MYC, MDM2 and NRF210,17\u201319 can lead to an increase in SSP enzyme expression, also allowing cells to become resistant to depletion of exogenous serine. Conversely, although the p53 tumour suppressor protein can inhibit PHGDH expression20, loss of p53 also makes cells more vulnerable to increased ROS that accompanies the switch to de novo serine synthesis, resulting in a decreased survival in serine free medium7.",
                "Several studies have shown that dietary serine limitation can slow tumour growth in vivo7,17,21\u201324. Mice fed with a serine and glycine free diet show a decrease in circulating serine and glycine levels and this approach can retard the development and progression of tumours in both xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models. As predicted by in vitro studies, the survival response to dietary serine and glycine restriction was enhanced by interference with antioxidant defence mechanisms17. Activation of KRAS or enhanced expression of PHGDH, on the other hand, resulted in an increase in de novo serine synthesis which limited the response to the serine and glycine free diet17,23. Under these conditions, it is possible that inhibition of the SSP will cooperate with dietary serine and glycine restriction to improve therapeutic efficacy. Indeed, a recent study has shown cooperation between deletion of PSAT1 (the second step in the serine synthesis pathway) and dietary serine depletion in the inhibition of Myc-driven liver cancer25.",
                "Several small molecule inhibitors of PHGDH that inhibit de novo serine synthesis and retard the growth of cancer cells that are dependent on this pathway have been generated26\u201328. This first generation of inhibitors showed relatively weak potency, leading to the development of more active, second generation inhibitors, which were effective to limit cancer cell growth in vitro under serine deprivation but were not suitable for use in vivo29. More recently, a highly potent, selective and reversible PHGDH inhibitor, PH755, has been reported to prevent the flux of labelled glucose into serine in LPS stimulated macrophages and improve the survival of mice exposed to LPS-induced endotoxemia30. This inhibitor has also been shown to be effective to limit tumour growth in vivo24,31. In this study we examine the cooperation between serine and glycine starvation (-SG) and PHGDH inhibition (PHGDHi), demonstrating a reduction\u00a0of tumour cell\u00a0growth in vitro and in vivo. Our data support the therapeutic potential of combining dietary serine and glycine restriction with a small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH."

                        "Cells can take up exogenous serine or synthesise serine from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), using the serine synthesis pathway (Fig.\u00a01a). To assess the relative contribution of each of these pathways to the growth of cells in culture, we measured the proliferation of a series of colorectal cancer cell lines grown in complete medium (CM), medium lacking serine and glycine (-SG), CM with PH755 (a PHGDH inhibitor) or a combination of -SG plus PH755. As noted previously14,27, the response to serine and glycine starvation varied between cell lines ranging from RKO, HT-29 and SW48 cells that showed a significant dependence on exogenous serine and glycine for proliferation, to DLD-1, LoVo, CACO-2 and MDA-MB-468 cells (a breast cancer line previously shown to carry PHGDH amplification) that were not affected by lack of serine and glycine in the medium (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Figure 1a). There was a trend for colorectal cancer cell lines carrying KRAS mutation (HCT-15, HCT116, DLD-1, LoVo and SW480) to be more resistant to serine and glycine withdrawal compared to those cell lines carrying BRAF mutations (RKO, HT-29, SW1417 and CL-34), although SW620 (KRAS mutant) and VACO5 (BRAF mutant) were exceptions to this trend (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Figure 1a). While these results are broadly in line with the previously reported role of activated KRAS in supporting de novo serine synthesis17, it is clear that other genetic alterations \u2013 such as amplification of PHGDH in MDA-MB-468 cells14 \u2013 also contribute to the dependence of cancer cells on a supply of exogenous serine. Treatment of the cells with PH755 in complete medium had no clear effect on the proliferation rate of the cells, indicating that at this concentration, the inhibitor has no non-specific inhibitory effect on cell growth. However, combining -SG medium with PH755 completely inhibited the growth of all the cell lines tested (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Figure 1a).Fig. 1PHGDH inhibition cooperates with serine/glycine depletion to impede tumour growth in vitro.a As a non-essential amino acid, serine can be taken up from the environment or newly synthesised through the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). The SSP consists of a three-step enzymatic reaction starting with the NAD+-dependent oxidation of the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-PHP). This first reaction is catalysed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), an enzyme that can be efficiently targeted by the pharmacological compound PH755. The 3-PHP produced during the PHGDH reaction is then converted into 3-phosphoserine (3-PS) by phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) in a glutamate-dependent transamination reaction. Finally, phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) catalyses the hydrolysis of 3-PS to produce serine. Serine is involved in numerous metabolic pathways including nucleotide synthesis or glutathione synthesis, a major antioxidant for the cells. Serine availability can thus be targeted by depleting it from the extracellular environment or by inhibition of the SSP using PH755. b Growth curves of colon cancer cell lines grown in complete medium (CM) or equivalent medium lacking serine and glycine (-SG) and treated or not with 10\u2009\u00b5M PH755.

                        "Accompanying the lack of proliferation was a strong reduction of BrdU incorporation into newly synthesised DNA after 48\u2009h incubation with -SG medium plus PH755, compared to either treatment alone (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Figure 1b). The decrease in cells undergoing S-phase was accompanied by an accumulation of cells in G2/M phase (Supplementary Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 1c) and an increase in the proportion of SubG1 cells in the double-treated condition, indicating an increase in cell death (Fig.\u00a02b). The appearance of cleaved caspase-3 confirmed the induction of apoptosis in cells cultured in -SG medium and treated with PH755 (Fig.\u00a02c). Using uniformly labelled glucose, we showed that cells grown in the presence of exogenous serine diverted little glucose into serine and glycine synthesis, as reflected by the negligible accumulation of m\u2009+\u20093 serine and m\u2009+\u20092 glycine (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Figure 1d), regardless of the presence or absence of PH755. Of note, these cells maintained much higher overall intracellular serine and glycine levels than cells grown in the -SG medium (Supplementary Figure 1e). When starved of serine and glycine, all the cell lines showed a clear increase in de novo serine synthesis, as indicated by the accumulation of m\u2009+\u20093 labelled serine and m\u2009+\u20092 labelled glycine (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Figure 1d). Interestingly, this response was weaker in the HT-29 cells, consistent with their lower ability to proliferate in the absence of exogenous serine. However, treatment of the cells with PH755 completely blocked de novo synthesis of serine and glycine, both in complete medium and under serine and glycine starvation (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Figure 1d), demonstrating the efficiency of this inhibitor in blocking PHGDH activity and the SSP. To further verify the specificity of PH755, we tested the effect of genetic deletion of PHGDH. DLD-1 cells showed a strong induction of PHGDH expression in response to serine and glycine starvation, which was much less robust in HT-29 cells \u2013 consistent with the relative ability of these cell lines to proliferate in the absence of exogenous serine and glycine (Supplementary Figure 1f). Proliferation of these cells following CRISPR-mediated deletion of PHGDH (Supplementary Figure 1f) essentially mirrored that seen following PH755 treatment (Fig.\u00a01b), supporting the function of PH755 as an inhibitor of PHGDH.Fig. 2PHGDH inhibition cooperates with serine/glycine depletion to limit DNA synthesis, survival and organoid growth.a Percentage of BrdU positive cells in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells grown in CM or -SG medium \u00b110\u2009\u00b5M PH755 for 48\u2009h followed by a 5-h incubation with 10\u2009\u00b5M BrdU.

                        "Cells grown in 2D on plastic can show different metabolic requirements compared to cells grown under more physiologically relevant conditions, and so we examined the effect of serine and glycine depletion and PH755 treatment on intestinal tumour organoids derived from Vil1-creER;Apcfl/fl (Apc) or Vil1-creER;Apcfl/fl;KrasG12D/+ (Apc Kras) mice (Fig.\u00a02e and Supplementary Figure 2a). As shown previously, organoids derived from Apc mutant tumours showed some sensitivity to serine and glycine depletion, which was not evident in Apc/Kras mutant organoids. Consistent with the observations in 2D cell lines, treatment with PH755 alone did not impact the growth of Apc or Apc/Kras organoids. However, the combination of serine and glycine starvation and PH755 treatment very effectively inhibited the growth of both Apc and Apc/Kras organoids (Fig.\u00a02e and Supplementary Figure 2a). Of note, this effect was not restricted to cancer-derived intestinal organoids, as a substantial reduction in growth was also observed in normal small intestine organoids treated with the combination treatment (Supplementary Figure 2b). To validate the effect of the double treatment in human cells, we tested four patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids with different KRAS status (C-001: WT, C-004: deletion, R-006: Gly12Asp and R-008: Gly13Asp)32. While -SG or PH755 treatment alone did not have any obvious impact on proliferation, in each case, the combination of drug and inhibitor greatly decreased organoid growth, regardless of KRAS status (Supplementary Figure 2c). While we see a trend for cells with KRAS mutations to be less sensitive to serine and glycine starvation alone, exceptions are likely to reflect other changes that influence the serine synthesis pathway such as PHGDH amplification."

                        "Serine is involved in numerous metabolic pathways, including the provision of one-carbon units and glycine for purine synthesis and the maintenance of redox homeostasis through glutathione production. The contribution of de novo synthesised serine to these pathways can be assessed by following the fate of uniformly carbon labelled glucose (Fig.\u00a03a). As expected, cells grown in the presence of\u00a0serine and glycine showed little evidence of the use of de novo synthesised serine for ATP or GTP synthesis (Fig.\u00a03b), the majority of label (m\u2009+\u20095) deriving from ribose synthesised through the pentose phosphate pathway (Fig.\u00a03a). Under serine and glycine starvation, cells that were best able to adapt to these conditions (HCT116, DLD-1 and MDA-MB-468) accumulated m\u2009+\u20096 to m\u2009+\u20099 labelled purines, consistent with the incorporation of labelled serine generated through the SSP (Fig.\u00a03b). As expected, serine and glycine starvation with PH755 treatment effectively inhibited synthesis of ATP and GTP (Fig.\u00a03b). Glutathione can be labelled from glucose derived glycine (m\u2009+\u20092) or glutamate (m\u2009+\u20092; Fig.\u00a03a), although under these conditions the generation of m\u2009+\u20092 glutamate was not impacted by PH755 treatment in most of the cell lines tested (Supplementary Figure 3a). The increase in the proportion of m\u2009+\u20092 and m\u2009+\u20094 labelled glutathione detected in response to the removal of exogenous serine and glycine is therefore likely to reflect the increase in SSP activity and production of labelled glycine, a response that was blocked by treatment with PH755 (Fig.\u00a03c). Importantly, the inability of the double-treated cells to newly synthetise purines and glutathione was evident as early as 3- or 6-h post-treatment, demonstrating that this response represents a primary effect of the combination treatment (Supplementary Figure 3b). Of note, total purine and GSH levels were not decreased in the double-treated cells compared to the cells grown in -SG medium, probably reflecting the lack of consumption of these metabolites when proliferation is inhibited (Supplementary Figure 3c). These results confirm that metabolic pathways that are dependent on serine and critical for the growth of cancer cells are efficiently inhibited by a combination of serine and glycine starvation and the PHGDH inhibitor.Fig. 3Combining PHGDH inhibition with serine/glycine depletion inhibits purine and glutathione synthesis.a Scheme representing the fate of uniformly carbon labelled glucose (m\u2009+\u20096) into purine and glutathione synthesis. Glucose is converted through the pentose phosphate pathway into ribose-5-phosphate, a five-carbon sugar (m\u2009+\u20095), that will be added to purine bases to form purine nucleosides. Purine rings also contain two one-carbon units and an intact glycine that can both come from serine metabolism. Serine is synthesised from the glycolytic intermediate 3-PG, producing an m\u2009+\u20093 isotopomer from uniformly labelled glucose. Serine (m\u2009+\u20093) can generate labelled glycine (m\u2009+\u20092) and labelled one-carbon units (m\u2009+\u20091). The combination of labelled ribose phosphate, glycine and one-carbon units can thus generate m\u2009+\u20095 and greater labelled purines. While m\u2009+\u20095 labelled purines represent a contribution of glucose to ribose synthesis alone, m\u2009+\u20096\u20139 labelled purines are likely to represent a contribution from de novo synthesised serine. Glutathione is made from glycine, glutamate (both can be m\u2009+\u20092 labelled from glucose) and cysteine. The main isotopomer (m\u2009+\u20092) of glutathione is likely to be derived from m\u2009+\u20092 glycine with the m\u2009+\u20094 labelling reflecting incorporation of m\u2009+\u20092 glycine and m\u2009+\u20092 glutamate. b, c Intracellular ATP and GTP levels (b) or GSH level (c) in HT-29, HCT116, DLD-1 and MDA-MB-468 cells grown in CM or -SG medium \u00b110\u2009\u00b5M PH755 containing U-[13C]-glucose were measured by LC-MS.

                        "All cells deprived of serine and glycine and treated with PH755 showed a strong growth inhibition (Figs. 1b, 2e, Supplementary Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 2a\u2013c). While supplementation of the double-treated cells with either formate (to replenish the one-carbon cycle) or glycine alone did not restore growth, addition of formate and glycine effectively rescued proliferation (Fig.\u00a04a). This proliferation rescue was accompanied by the recovery of ATP and GTP synthesis (Fig.\u00a04b), and the partial restoration of the pool of unlabelled serine (Fig.\u00a04c). Using labelled glycine, we were able to demonstrate that this pool of serine is generated from glycine and one-carbon units provided by formate, a response that is made more evident following the addition of a pulse of unlabelled serine to allow the labelled serine to accumulate (Fig.\u00a04d). These results show that the inhibition of proliferation is a direct effect of inhibition of de novo serine synthesis by PH755, and not a response to any off-target toxicity. The specificity of the metabolic defect induced by PH755 was further supported by the similarity of the response to genetic deletion of PHGDH (Supplementary Figure 4a\u2013c).Fig. 4Formate and glycine supplementation rescues cancer cells grown in serine/glycine free medium in presence of the PHGDH inhibitor.a Proliferation assay of HT-29 and HCT116 cells grown in -SG medium or -SG medium\u2009+\u200910\u2009\u00b5M PH755 supplemented or not with 1\u2009mM sodium formate (For), 0.4\u2009mM glycine (Gly) or both (For/Gly).

                        "While the effect of PH755 was consistent with a specific inhibition of PHGDH, analysis of the expression of the serine synthesis pathway enzymes in response to PH755 treatment revealed an unexpected response in some of the cell lines. Serine and glycine starvation has been shown to lead to the activation of ATF-4, which can mediate a general survival response to metabolic stress. Importantly, serine starvation leads to an ATF-4 dependent induction of expression of the SSP enzymes, so contributing to the ability of the cells to adapt to a reduction in exogenous serine levels12. We confirmed the importance of this response by showing that depletion of ATF-4 resulted in an inability of cells to adapt and grow under serine and glycine starvation (Fig.\u00a05a). As expected, serine and glycine depletion led to an induction of expression of all three SSP enzymes in all the cell lines tested, although this was less robust in MDA-MB-468 cells that constitutively overexpress these enzymes (Fig.\u00a05b). However, in four of the colon cancer lines (HT-29, HCT116, CACO2 and DLD-1), further treatment of serine and glycine starved cells with PH755 diminished this increase in SSP enzyme expression (Fig.\u00a05b), although this was not seen in SW48 cells. A similar response following serine and glycine starvation and PHGDH deletion confirmed that this was a response to loss of PHGDH activity (Fig.\u00a05c). While the decrease in activation of the SSP enzymes is correlated with the growth inhibition seen following serine and glycine starvation and PH755 treatment, the failure of doubly treated cells to induce the SSP enzymes is evident within 4\u20138\u2009h of serine and glycine starvation (Fig.\u00a05d), suggesting this is a direct response to PHGDH inhibition rather than an indirect response to growth arrest. The loss of ability to induce SSP enzyme expression in response to serine and glycine starvation was accompanied by a general inability to activate an ATF-4 response, as measured by a lack of induction of the canonical ATF-4 target, ASNS (Fig.\u00a05b, c). These results suggest that cells can respond to the combination of serine starvation and SSP inhibition differently than to either intervention alone.Fig. 5Combining PHGDH inhibition with serine/glycine depletion impairs the general ATF-4 response to amino acid starvation.a Growth curves of HT-29, HCT116 and DLD-1 cells transiently depleted of ATF-4 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) and cultured in -SG medium for 4 days.

                        "To explore how PHGDH activity affects the ATF-4 response induced following serine and glycine withdrawal, we examined the level of activation of the upstream regulators responsible for ATF-4 induction. In response to amino acid starvation, the accumulation of uncharged tRNA leads to the activation and autophosphorylation of the kinase General Control Non-derepressible 2 (GCN2)33. GCN2 then phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation\u00a0initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) at serine 51, leading to a general downregulation of global protein synthesis but selectively inducing the translation of ATF-434. As expected, serine and glycine withdrawal induced the phosphorylation of GCN2 and its target eIF2\u03b1 in HCT116 and DLD-1 cells (Fig.\u00a06a). Interestingly, this induction of GCN2 and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was sustained or even more pronounced in cells co-treated with PH755 (Fig.\u00a06a), demonstrating that the lack of ATF-4 upregulation in the double-treated cells was not due to a lack of activation of its upstream regulators. ATF-4 protein levels can also be regulated through ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation35,36. However, while treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 led to a strong accumulation of ATF-4 in cells grown in complete medium, there was no restoration of ATF-4 protein levels or expression of target gene products ASNS and PSAT in cells grown in -SG medium plus PH755 (Supplementary Figure 5a). Furthermore, gene expression analysis showed that ATF4 was induced at the transcriptional level by 24\u2009h after serine and glycine deprivation regardless of the presence of the PHGDH inhibitor (Fig.\u00a06b). These data indicate that the lack of ATF-4 induction in double-treated cells was not due to increased protein degradation or decreased transcription. As expected, the transcription of ATF-4 target genes\u00a0encoding\u00a0ASNS and the\u00a0SSP enzymes was strongly up-regulated in serine and glycine starved cells (Fig.\u00a06b and Supplementary Figure 5b). Interestingly, the transcription of ATF-4 target genes reflected the extent of ATF-4 induction in the different cell lines grown in -SG medium plus PH755. DLD-1 cells, which maintained some induction of ATF-4 under these conditions (Fig.\u00a06e), retained the ability to induce expression of PHGDH, ASNS, PSAT and PSPH (Fig.\u00a06b and Supplementary Figure 5b) while HT-29 and HCT116 cells, which showed a more blunted induction of ATF-4 (Fig.\u00a06e) also showed a more severe defect in the ability to transcriptionally activate these ATF-4 target genes (Fig.\u00a06b and Supplementary Figure 5b). We therefore concluded that PH755 treatment did not primarily affect the transcription of ATF-4 or ATF-4 target genes, but impacted the subsequent expression of each of these proteins. To determine whether this reflected a general inhibition of translation resulting from the dramatic decrease of serine and glycine availability seen in this condition, we looked at the incorporation of puromycin, a tyrosyl-tRNA mimetic, into newly synthesised polypeptides37 in cells grown in CM or -SG medium plus PH755. Interestingly, while we observed a modest decrease in the amount of puromycin-labelled peptides in response to serine/glycine withdrawal, this reduction was much more pronounced in presence of the PHGDH inhibitor (Fig.\u00a06c). Consistent with a global inhibition of translation in the double-treated cells, the ability of proteasome inhibition to drive the accumulation of short-lived proteins such as c-MYC, HIF1\u03b1 and p53 was fully blocked in -SG plus PH755-treated cells (Fig.\u00a06d). As reported under other conditions that induce a general inhibition of protein synthesis (such as cycloheximide or puromycin treatment)38, mTORC1 is hyper-activated in the double-treated cells, as shown by the accumulation of phosphorylated S6K (Supplementary Figure 5c). Therefore, it seems that the lack of serine and glycine availability triggered by the inhibition of both extracellular and intracellular supplies of these amino acids (Supplementary Figure 1e) interrupts normal translation and prevents the induction of an ATF-4-mediated protective response. In support of this model, we observed that the effect of PHGDH inhibition on the ATF-4 response was specific to serine and glycine deprivation, since treatment with PH755 did not prevent the induction of ATF-4 targets in response to ER stress (Supplementary Figure 5d). Furthermore, supplementation of the double-treated cells with formate and glycine \u2013 a treatment that restored some level of serine availability (Fig.\u00a04c) \u2013 fully rescued the ATF-4 response (Fig.\u00a06e). Therefore, in the absence of extracellular serine, PHGDH activity becomes essential to maintain global protein synthesis, allowing the induction of a protective ATF-4 response.Fig. 6Combining PHGDH inhibition with serine/glycine depletion inhibits global protein synthesis.a Cells were grown in CM or -SG medium supplemented or not with 10\u2009\u00b5M PH755 for 24\u2009h.

                        "Our in vitro data indicated that the growth inhibitory response to serine and glycine depletion is greatly augmented by treatment of cells with the PHGDH inhibitor, prompting us to test the efficacy of this approach in vivo. Previous reports have shown that our serine- and glycine-free (-SG) diet can lead to a modest drop in body weight in mice7 and we showed inhibition of both normal and cancer intestinal organoid growth in response to double treatment in vitro (Supplementary Figure 2). To assess the tolerability of dietary serine/glycine limitation with PH755 treatment, we examined the response to the various treatments in a cohort of tumour-free immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice. As seen previously7, mice moved to the -SG diet showed a slight drop in weight that stabilised over the course of the study (Supplementary Figure 6a). Treatment with PH755 alone did not result in any detectable adverse response in these mice, which did not lose body weight compared to control mice (Supplementary Figure 6a). However, mice co-treated with PH755 and the -SG diet showed greater weight loss compared to either treatment alone (Supplementary Figure 6a), despite remaining active and appearing healthy. The weight loss was highly responsive to the dose of PH755, and modulation of the dose (from 75 to 50\u2009mg/kg) was successful in limiting weight loss to <20% over the course of the study (Supplementary Figure 6a). Serine is important in brain development and function and PHGDH deficiency in humans can lead to neurological defects such as microcephaly, psychomotor retardation and seizures39. We therefore assessed the impact of -SG diet and PHGDH inhibitor treatment on the brain morphology of a cohort of C57BL/6J mice after 20 days of treatment. Microscopic examination of coronal sections from the brains of the four groups of mice at the level of the pyriform cortex, caudal diencephalon, caudal mesencephalon and rostral cerebellum did not reveal any histopathological lesions in any of the sections examined. Indeed, Haematoxylin & eosin stained sections exhibit normal histological features with no evidence of degeneration, necrosis or inflammation (Supplementary Figure 6b, c). Furthermore, the brain weight remained unchanged in all groups of mice (Supplementary Figure 6b). We also looked for other signs of toxicity of the double treatment in these normal mice. Measurement of plasma AST and ALT activity at end point did not reveal any significant elevation of these markers of liver toxicity in the group of mice treated with -SG diet and PH755 (Supplementary Figure 6d), while plasma urea and creatinine levels remained normal in the double-treated mice, suggesting that there was no kidney damage (Supplementary Figure 6e).",
                        "The only clear deleterious effect of the double treatment in mice was weight loss, and our in vitro work using normal mice organoids derived from small intestine revealed that the combination treatment altered their ability to grow (Supplementary Figure 2b). While serine and glycine starvation or PHGDH inhibition alone had no detectable effect on gut morphology, we did note a significant decrease in the length of intestinal villi in animals co-treated with the -SG diet and PH755 (Supplementary Figure 6f), consistent with the greater weight loss seen in these mice. However, these mice showed no clear defect in crypt proliferation \u2013 assessed by Ki-67 staining \u2013 (Supplementary Figure 6g), suggestive of relatively unperturbed crypt homeostasis. These results are consistent with the observation that reduction in the dose of PHGDH inhibitor stops further weight loss and suggest that short-term combination treatment does not cause long-term damage."

                        "To explore the antitumor efficacy of the combination therapy, we used xenograft models with two of the colon cancer cell lines that had been tested in vitro, DLD-1 and HCT116. Following subcutaneous injection of cells, mice were transferred to a -SG or control diet when tumours started to become evident and treated with PH755 2\u20134 days later. As seen in the non-tumour-bearing mice, the double-treated DLD-1 tumour-bearing mice showed more weight loss compared to either treatment alone but a careful modulation of the dose of PH755 used in association with the -SG diet was able to limit the weight loss in these mice to <20% over the course of the experiment (Supplementary Figure 7a). This enhanced weight loss was avoided by increasing the time between diet change and PH755 treatment from 2 to 4 days in the HCT116 experiment (Supplementary Figure 7a, b). Analysis of the circulating amino acid levels at the end point of the studies confirmed previous observations that the -SG diet resulted in a decrease in plasma serine and glycine levels (Fig.\u00a07a and Supplementary Figure 7c). While treatment of mice with PH755 had a more modest effect on circulating serine and glycine, a combination of the -SG diet and PH755 most effectively lowered plasma serine and glycine levels reaching absolute concentration as low as 58\u2009\u03bcM serine (versus 267.7\u2009\u03bcM in control mice and 99.9\u2009\u03bcM in mice fed a -SG diet only) and 102.3\u2009\u03bcM glycine (versus 367.6\u2009\u03bcM in control mice and 143.6\u2009\u03bcM in mice fed a -SG diet only; Fig.\u00a07a and Supplementary Figure 7c). The growth of tumours arising from DLD-1 cells was not affected by dietary intervention or PH755 treatment alone (Fig.\u00a07b), consistent with the lack of effect of either of these treatments on the proliferation of these cells in vitro (Fig.\u00a01b). However, a combination of diet and PH755 strongly inhibited the growth of these tumours (Fig.\u00a07b). The growth of HCT116 xenograft tumours was somewhat sensitive to dietary serine and glycine restriction (as previously shown7) and also showed a trend to a decrease in mice treated with PH755 (Fig.\u00a07c), consistent with a previous report showing an effect of PH755 on HCT116 tumour growth24. However, the combination treatment of diet and PH755 almost completely blocked the growth of these tumours (Fig.\u00a07c). Interestingly, the strong growth inhibition observed in the double-treated tumours was accompanied by an increased cell death, as reflected by an increased number of active caspase-3 positive cells in DLD-1 tumours treated with the combination therapy (Fig.\u00a07d). Analysis of the serine and glycine levels in the tumours from these mice mirrored the results from the plasma, showing either PH755 treatment or -SG diet lowered intra-tumoral serine and glycine levels (Fig.\u00a07e and Supplementary Figure 7d), although in each case the -SG diet was more effective in lowering intra-tumoral serine and glycine levels that treatment with the PHGDH inhibitor. HCT116 tumours showed a modest further drop in serine and glycine in the combination diet and drug treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7d) but in DLD-1 tumours, the reduction in serine in response to the -SG diet was not further affected by additional PH755 treatment (Fig.\u00a07e). Nevertheless, a further reduction in intra-tumoral glycine in the double-treated mice suggests that flux through the SSP is lower in the double-treated tumours and that the maintenance of the low steady state levels of serine may reflect the decrease in growth (and serine consumption) under these conditions (Fig.\u00a07e).Fig. 7Dietary restriction of serine and glycine and PHGDH inhibition synergizes to deplete circulating and intratumor levels of these amino acids to inhibit tumour growth in xenograft models of colorectal cancer.a Serine and glycine levels in plasma from DLD-1 tumour-bearing mice fed a control diet (CTR) or an equivalent diet lacking serine and glycine (-SG) and treated with vehicle (Veh) or PH755.

                        "Our in vitro data showed that complete inhibition of serine availability through serine starvation and PHGDH inhibition led to defects in one-carbon metabolism and a global inhibition of translation that correlated with a failure to induce an ATF-4 response. To examine these responses to dietary serine/glycine starvation and PHGDH inhibition in vivo, we first examined purine levels in the tumours. As noted in vitro (Supplementary Figure 3c), we did not see any difference in total ATP or GTP levels in tumours from double-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7e), likely reflecting the decreased proliferation of the double-treated tumour cells. In the methionine cycle, the regeneration of SAM from SAH requires one-carbon units. Interestingly, we noted a clear reduction in the SAM/SAH ratio in tumours from -SG diet mice, which was further reduced in mice on -SG diet plus PH755 (Fig.\u00a07f). These results are consistent with a reduction in one-carbon availability in mice on a -SG diet that is exacerbated in double-treated mice.",

By contrast, treating mice with the PHGDH inhibitor alone did not result in any change in PHGDH or PSAT1 expression, suggesting that only dietary restriction of serine and glycine was effective to deplete serine and glycine intra-tumoral levels enough to lead to an ATF-4 response in vivo. Interestingly, the induction of PSAT1 and PHGDH was equivalent or even more pronounced in the double-treated tumours compared to the tumours from mice fed a -SG diet only, showing that, in vivo, the combination treatment did not reduce available serine sufficiently to compromise the ability of tumour cells to induce an ATF-4 response (Supplementary Figure 7f, g). Taken together, these data show that the inhibition of tumour growth correlate with defects in serine metabolism, rather than inhibition of translation."

                "This study has explored the efficacy of a combination of serine/glycine depletion with PHGDH inhibition to inhibit cancer cell growth. Our analyses of cell lines and organoids showed that when used at a concentration that effectively inhibited de novo serine synthesis, treatment with PH755 alone had no impact on cell growth. These data suggest that all the cell lines used were able to import exogenous serine efficiently enough to maintain proliferation. These results are in contrast to previously reported PHGDH inhibitors that inhibited growth of PHGDH expressing cells in the presence of extracellular serine and glycine26\u201328. These previously published compounds showed weaker activity than PH755, and in some cases exhibited some additional activities, such as electron transport chain inhibition26. Differences in the mode of action of the inhibitors (PH755 is an NAD+ competitive inhibitor while others function by disrupting the PHGDH tetramer27 or as non-competitive inhibitors26,28) or in the selectivity of these compounds at the doses used in cell growth assays may account for the different responses in the presence of serine. Previous studies have also shown that cell lines like MDA-MB-468, which express high levels of PHGDH and have activated SSP, are sensitive to sh-RNA mediated depletion of PHGDH, regardless of the presence of serine in the medium14,15, indicating a difference between loss and inhibition of PHGDH. It has been suggested that activation of the SSP is important not only for serine production, but can also contribute to the generation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (through the PSAT1 reaction)14 or the redox balance in the cell (as PHGDH consumes NAD+)40. However, depletion and inhibition of PHGDH is unlikely to affect these two processes differently. It is possible that the PHGDH protein has functions additional to supporting the SSP and that this activity is maintained in the presence of the PHGDH inhibitor. Further analysis will be required to address this point.",
                "Using xenograft models of intestinal cancer, we have provided a proof of concept that limiting the availability of serine and glycine to tumours by targeting the exogenous and endogenous supply can have therapeutic benefit. While we did not see a clear beneficial effect of PH755 treatment alone compared to the -SG diet, the combination showed augmented therapeutic efficacy. These observations show some parallels to other approaches aimed at limiting the supply of NEAAs to cancers that are already in clinical use, such as treatment of patients with ASS1 deficient cancers (so blocking the de novo pathway of arginine synthesis) with ADI-PEG20, to degrade circulating arginine41. Consistent with a recent study showing no overt toxicity associated with depletion of PHGDH in adult mice (sparing the brain)42, mice fed on a normal diet tolerated treatment with PH755 well, showing that in the presence of exogenous serine, inhibition of the SSP was not detrimental to health. Similarly, PH755 did not affect the growth of cells in serine and glycine containing medium. However, we did not assess long-term treatment with the inhibitor, and studies showing that serine synthesis through the activity of PHGDH is important for the maintenance of nucleotide levels43 or haem production in endothelial cells44 suggests that there may be some longer term on-target effects that would need careful monitoring. In particular, in mice and humans, PHGDH deficiency leads to severe neurological defects, although PHGDH heterozygous mice are normal, despite a reduction in brain serine levels45,46. The lack of obvious neurological symptoms following PH755 treatment possibly reflects an incomplete inhibition of the SSP or a lower requirement for PHGDH in the adult brain. Even the combination of -SG diet and PH755 treatment \u2013 which effectively lowered circulating serine levels \u2013 did not lead to overt morphological changes in the brain, although more detailed behavioural analysis would be required to rule out any effect on brain function. More generally, the mice on the combination treatment appeared active and healthy. There was no evidence of liver or kidney toxicity although a reduction in intestinal villi length correlated with the weight loss observed in these mice. However, the intestinal crypts appeared to be unaffected, consistent with the stabilisation of weight following a reduction in PH755 dosing, even when left on the -SG diet. It remains possible that long-term serine and glycine limitation will result in unwanted toxicities. Indeed, a recent study showing long-term dietary serine and glycine starvation leads to retinal defects in mice47 suggests that shorter term application of these approaches for cancer therapy are likely to be required. However, it is encouraging that we were able to maintain the combined drug and diet treatment for long enough to detect a therapeutic benefit without any acute adverse effects. Further studies to establish the optimal effective dose and dosing regime, to balance modulation of serine availability to the tumour with weight loss, will likely lead to even better responses.",
                "The inhibition of tumour growth in response to -SG diet plus PHGDH inhibition shown here are consistent with a recent study showing that depletion of PSAT1 (the second step in the SSP) in liver cancers reduced tumour growth only in a -SG diet25. In vitro, we show that removal of extracellular serine and glycine availability combined with inhibition of PHGDH effectively depleted intracellular serine levels and blocked glutathione and nucleotide synthesis in cultured cells, consistent with defects in one-carbon metabolism. Inactivation of mTORC1 in response to amino acid starvation results in a general inhibition of translation and increased autophagy48. This response is often coupled with the selective activation of ATF-4 translation, which mediates a protective response including the upregulation of expression of amino acid transporters and de novo synthesis pathways35,49. While we also saw induction of an ATF-4 response in cells starved of serine and glycine, we found that the dramatic drop in serine availability seen in response to both serine and glycine starvation and PHGDH inhibition in vitro led to a more profound inhibition of translation that prevented the induction of the protective ATF-4 response. This defect was reflected in the almost complete growth inhibition seen in cells that were grown in both adherent 2D conditions or as organoids following serine and glycine starvation plus PHGDH inhibition. While we were able to find evidence of a defect in one-carbon availability in tumours from double-treated mice, we did not see a loss of an ATF-4 response. It remains possible that synthesis of other proteins may be retarded in double-treated mice, but the maintenance of the ATF-4 response likely reflects the retention of some serine availability to the tumour cell (potentially from surrounding stromal cells). These results highlight that caution needs to be applied to translating in vitro results \u2013 where complete blocks to metabolic pathways can be achieved \u2013 to in vivo situations \u2013 where these pathways may only be partially inhibited. However, the retention of an ATF-4 response may explain why the combination therapy \u2013 which strongly inhibited normal cell growth in vitro \u2013 was not highly toxic to normal cells in mice.",
                "While our work supports a role for defects in one-carbon metabolism in the success of the combination treatment, other responses to lack of serine availability may also contribute. For example, a recent study has shown that inhibition of tumour growth in -SG fed mice may reflects the production of toxic deoxysphingolipids24. While the combination of PH755 with a serine and glycine depleted diet could be beneficial in many cancer types, tumours arising in an environment naturally low in serine could benefit from PH755 treatment without the requirement for additional dietary intervention23. As shown recently, treatment with PH755 was effective in limiting serine synthesis and tumour growth of metastases in the brain, where environmental serine and glycine levels are low31. Furthermore, tumours carrying other genetic alterations that lead to resistance to dietary serine depletion, such as p53 or KRAS mutations, may be sensitive to the combination therapy described here. Stratification of tumours to account for intrinsic vulnerability to serine limitation and extrinsic limitation of serine levels is likely to further improve the efficacy of this approach."

For short-term experiments, cells were moved to the previously described medium with glucose substituted for 10\u2009mM U-[13C]-glucose for only 3\u2009h or 6\u2009h before metabolite extraction. For measurement of glycine conversion into serine during rescue experiment, cells were grown for 24\u2009h in -SG medium supplemented with 10\u2009\u00b5M PH755, 1\u2009mM sodium formate and 0.4\u2009mM glycine. This medium was then replaced with matched medium with glycine substituted for 0.4\u2009mM 13C215N1-glycine for 1\u2009h before metabolite extraction. For half of the samples, a pulse of 1\u2009mM unlabelled serine was added to the medium 1\u2009min before metabolite extraction to allow labelled serine to accumulate. Cells were then washed with PBS and metabolites were extracted using ice-cold extraction buffer composed of methanol, acetonitrile and H2O in the following ratio 50:30:20. For LC-MS analysis on tumour samples, tissue was homogenised (20\u201340\u2009mg tissue/mL of the previously described extraction buffer) using the Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). Samples were spun (16,000\u00d7g/10\u2009min/0\u2009\u00b0C) and the supernatant collected to be centrifuged again (16,000\u00d7g/10\u2009min/0\u2009\u00b0C). Supernatant were then collected for LC-MS analysis. For LC-MS analysis on mice plasma, plasma was diluted 20\u201350 fold with the same extraction buffer, vortexed for 30\u2009s and centrifuged (16,000\u00d7g/10\u2009min/0\u2009\u00b0C). Supernatant were then collected for analysis. Absolute levels of serine and glycine in plasma was determined using 8-point calibration curves (from 2.5 to 800\u2009\u00b5M) with 13C315N1-serine and 13C215N1-glycine diluted in plasma. LC-MS analysis was performed as previously described9. Data were recorded using Xcalibur 4.0.27.19 software (Thermo Scientific). Verification of qualitative peak assignments was done with Qual Browser from Xcalibur 4.0.27.19 and metabolite peak integration was performed using TraceFinder 4.1."

Animal experiments were subject to ethical review by the Francis Crick Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and carried out under UK Home Office project license P319AE968 or by the CRUK Beatson Institute (reviewed and approved by the University of Glasgow and UK Home Office) and carried out under UK Home Office project license 70/8645. Mice (3\u20135 per cage) were allowed access to food and water ad libitum and were kept in a 12-h day/night cycle starting at 7:00 until 19:00. Rooms were kept at 21\u2009\u00b0C at 55% humidity. Mice were allowed to acclimatise for at least 1 week prior to the experiment. They were then randomly assigned to experimental groups. The experimental diets used in this study (control diet and -SG diet) were previously described as \u201cDiet 1-Control\u201d and \u201cDiet 1-SG-free\u201d17. Briefly, the control diet contains all essential amino acids as well as serine, glycine, glutamine, arginine, cystine and tyrosine. The -SG diet is the same as the control diet but is deprived of serine and glycine, which are compensated by a proportionally increased level of the other amino acids to reach the same total amino acid content."
