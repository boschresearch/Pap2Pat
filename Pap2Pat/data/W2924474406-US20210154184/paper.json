    "date": "2019-03-25",
    "abstract": "Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aberrant forms of tau protein accumulation leading to neuronal death in focal brain areas. Positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that bind to pathological tau are used in diagnosis, but there are no current therapies to eliminate these tau species. We employed targeted protein degradation technology to convert a tau PET-probe into a functional degrader of pathogenic tau. The hetero-bifunctional molecule QC-01\u2013175 was designed to engage both tau and Cereblon (CRBN), a substrate-receptor for the E3-ubiquitin ligase CRL4CRBN, to trigger tau ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. QC-01\u2013175 effected clearance of tau in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patient-derived neuronal cell models, with minimal effect on tau from neurons of healthy controls, indicating specificity for disease-relevant forms. QC-01\u2013175 also rescued stress vulnerability in FTD neurons, phenocopying CRISPR-mediated MAPT-knockout. This work demonstrates that aberrant tau in FTD patient-derived neurons is amenable to targeted degradation, representing an important advance for therapeutics.",

                "Tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau (P-tau) protein, in the form of intracellular paired helical filaments (PHFs) or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), within neurons and glia of affected brain regions, leading to cell death (Kosik et al., 1989; Morris et al., 2011; Cruts and Van Broeckhoven, 2015; Ghetti et al., 2015; Neumann et al., 2015; Olney et al., 2017; Goedert, 2004). Tauopathies can be either sporadic or inherited as autosomal dominant disease when caused by mutations in the MAPT gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau. FTD is the most common form of dementia in individuals under 60 years of age, affecting approximately 60,000 individuals in the USA alone, with an economic burden that is nearly twice that reported for AD (Galvin et al., 2017). Despite its devastating effects, there are currently no effective disease-modifying therapies, highlighting an urgent unmet need.",
                "One of the major bottlenecks in developing effective therapies for tauopathies resides in the fact that molecular mechanisms leading to neuronal toxicity and death are still not entirely understood (Congdon and Sigurdsson, 2018; Panza et al., 2016; Medina, 2018; G\u00f6tz et al., 2013). Cumulative evidence from murine tauopathy models and postmortem patient brain studies suggests that early tau post-translational modifications lead to misfolding, mislocalization, oligomerization, and changes in solubility. These events appear to be determinant toxicity effectors (Johnson and Stoothoff, 2004; Min et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2009; G\u00f6tz et al., 2013; Kopeikina et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2013; Yanamandra et al., 2013; Cowan and Mudher, 2013), whereas tau tangles alone are not sufficient to cause neuronal death (Cowan and Mudher, 2013; de Calignon et al., 2010; Kopeikina et al., 2012; Santacruz et al., 2005; Spires et al., 2006). Therefore, targeting early forms of toxic tau for clearance may facilitate the study of their role in disease etiology and be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce neuronal degeneration.",
                "A challenge in developing cell-permeable small molecules that target tau is the lack of a well-defined tau fold and active sites, in disease. Current investigative tau-directed therapeutics have focused on aggregation inhibitors (Brunden et al., 2010; Panza et al., 2016; Bulic et al., 2009), activators of protein clearance through autophagy (Boland et al., 2008; Kr\u00fcger et al., 2012; Medina, 2018; Wang and Mandelkow, 2012; Rubinsztein et al., 2015), and inhibition of tau kinases (Dolan and Johnson, 2010; Medina, 2018). Moreover, anti-tau immunotherapy has shown promise in animal models, but antibody affinity and specificity as well as strong immune responses pose critical challenges (Gu et al., 2013; Panza et al., 2016; Pedersen and Sigurdsson, 2015; Novak et al., 2017; Yanamandra et al., 2013). An alternative and promising strategy has focused on using anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) to decrease tau expression, leading to reversal of tau pathology in mouse and non-human primate models (DeVos et al., 2017; Mignon et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2014). Still, given potential limitations with existing approaches, developing small molecule agents that target early forms of toxic tau, and result in their degradation, may represent a uniquely advantageous strategy for halting tauopathies.",
                "Targeted protein degradation approaches have expanded the landscape of druggable proteins by providing a mechanism to transform a non-functional protein binder into an effective targeted degrader (Gechijian et al., 2018). Targeted protein degraders, also known as PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras), are an emerging strategy for ablating previously undruggable protein functions (Cromm et al., 2018; Gechijian et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2014; Lai and Crews, 2017). Structurally, degraders are hetero-bivalent compounds where a small molecule binder of the protein of interest is linked via a short linker to an E3-ligase recruiting molecule, such as the CRBN binder thalidomide (Figure 1A). This results in ternary complex formation between the protein of interest, the degrader molecule and the E3-ligase complex, in this case CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4CRBN), and induces ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the protein of interest (Figure 1B) (Fischer et al., 2014; Kr\u00f6nke et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014; Chamberlain et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2017; Metzger et al., 2014).",
                "In this study, we harnessed targeted protein degradation technology to transform one of the most clinically advanced tau PET (positron emission tomography) tracers, 18F-T807 (or 18F-AV-1451), into the tau degrader QC-01\u2013175 (Chien et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2016). 18F-T807 binds P-tau in vivo in a conformation-dependent manner, with highest efficiency in MAPT mutation carriers that produce AD-like PHF pathology (Jones et al., 2018), showing increased uptake in brain regions with significant tau deposition burden and little background binding in the cortex of normal brains. 18F-T807 is the most advanced tau PET tracer in terms of its investigation in vivo, with studies completed in numerous tauopathies including AD and PSP (Holt et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2018; Murugan et al., 2018; Saint-Aubert et al., 2017; Sch\u00f6ll et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2016; Spina et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2016; Schonhaut et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018). We now demonstrate that a T807-derived degrader molecule, QC-01\u2013175, preferentially degrades tau species in FTD patient-derived neuronal cell models, while sparing tau in healthy controls. Our results suggest that this degrader strategy may offer a promising opportunity for neutralizing the neurotoxic effects of tau."

                        "We designed and synthesized a small library of 25 hetero-bifunctional molecules and candidate tau degraders, containing variants of the tau PET tracer T807 (module 1), coupled through a linker of variable size and attachment chemistry (module 2) to the E3-ligase recruiting ligand pomalidomide, which engages with CRL4CRBN (module 3, Figure 1A and C\u2013I). Through iterative design and testing in vitro and in ex vivo human neuronal cells, where each module element played a role in tau degradation efficacy, we identified the lead compound QC-01\u2013175 (Figure 1C\u2013II) (detailed structure-activity-relationship analysis to be published elsewhere). This compound contains the core 5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole scaffold of T807, with the fluoro-pyridine ring replaced by a [PEG]2 linker attached to pomalidomide. We generated the corresponding negative control compound, QC-03\u2013075, by replacing the glutarimide in pomalidomide with a \u03b4-lactam ring, thus abrogating CRBN-binding capacity (Figure 1C\u2013III) (Huang et al., 2018).",
                        "A biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay was developed to measure in vitro affinity of the degrader molecule against wild-type (WT) and two variant forms of recombinant human tau: A152T and P301L (Figure 1D) (Kumaraswamy and Tobias, 2015; Petersen, 2017; Shah and Duncan, 2014). Known tau binders T807 and PE859 were used as positive controls to validate the BLI biosensor (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B) (Okuda et al., 2017; Okuda et al., 2015). In this in vitro format, although weaker binding was observed compared to PE859 (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A), QC-01\u2013175 was able to bind to immobilized, soluble forms of WT (KD1.2 \u03bcM), A152T (KD1.7 \u03bcM) and P301L (KD2.5 \u03bcM) within the same order of magnitude as the control T807 (KD1.8 \u00b5M, 2.1 \u03bcM and 1.7 \u03bcM, respectively) (Figure 1E, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B III, VI). As expected, in vitro QC-01\u2013175 and T807 displayed a significantly lower affinity for all recombinant immobilized tau forms than the reported KD of T807 for native, aggregated tau filaments from AD brain sections (KD15 nM) (Chien et al., 2013; Gobbi et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2013). This property enables T807-based PET tracers to distinguish pathological tau species from the functional tau found in cells, and suggested that QC-01\u2013175 may exhibit similar conformational selectivity. Comparison between binding of recombinant WT protein and variant tau forms, to either QC-01\u2013175 or the controls PE859 and T807, indicates that T807 and derivatives have low affinity for monomeric, soluble protein, independent of the presence of a tau variant (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B).",
                        "The PET tracer 18F-T807 has off-target activity against monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) and monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) (Lemoine et al., 2018; Vermeiren et al., 2018). MAO inhibition interferes with neurotransmitter signaling, complicating phenotypic analysis, and in the clinic is associated with undesired risks of hypertensive crisis and with drug-drug interactions. To test if modifications introduced to the T807 scaffold increase MAO off-target activity of the degrader, we tested T807 and QC-01\u2013175 in an in vitro MAO assay, using parnate, a known MAO inhibitor as positive control, and pomalidomide as a negative control. QC-01\u2013175 showed reduced inhibition of MAO relative to T807 (IC508.56 \u03bcM vs 0.14 \u03bcM, respectively) (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2). Together, in vitro testing of QC-01\u2013175 suggests that it has a preserved tau ligand-binding capacity and reduced off-target MAO inhibition."

                        "We employed two tauopathy cell models to assess the activity of QC-01\u2013175 in human neurons, one derived from a PSP patient carrier of the tau-A152T risk variant, and one derived from a behavioral-variant FTD patient carrier of the tau-P301L autosomal dominant mutation (both heterozygous, Figure 2\u2014source data 1) (Seo et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2016; Coppola et al., 2012; Mirra et al., 1999). Post-mitotic neurons were generated from patients\u2019 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived cortical-enriched neural progenitor cells (NPCs) subsequently differentiated into neurons for a period of 6 to 8 weeks, as previously described (Cheng et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2017). These patient-specific cellular models that express tau at endogenous levels, recapitulate disease-relevant tau phenotypes ex vivo (Fong et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2016) and present a valuable opportunity to test emerging therapeutics directly against a clinically relevant model of human disease (Dolmetsch and Geschwind, 2011; Silva et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2015; Inoue et al., 2014).",
                        "In A152T neurons treated with QC-01\u2013175 for 24 hr (Figure 2A), we observed a concentration-dependent reduction in total tau and P-tau levels by western blotting analysis (Figure 2B) and by tau ELISAs (Figure 2C). P-tauS396 and high-molecular-weight P-tauS396, identified as SDS-insoluble bands\u00a0>\u00a0250 kDa (Figure 2B), were effectively degraded at concentrations as low as 100 nM QC-01\u2013175, whereas maximal total tau clearance (Dmax, 24h) was achieved at 10 \u03bcM, consistent with expected binding preference of a T807-derivative for insoluble P-tau (Chien et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2016; Marqui\u00e9 et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2013). The observed Dmax, 24h of 75% for total tau and of 85% for P-tau S396, averaged across independent replicates (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1), was well above the 50% mutant tau allele expressed by heterozygous neurons, indicating that both variant and WT forms of tau are recognized and degraded. Previous mass spectrometry (MS) FLEXITau analysis demonstrated that tau-A152T and tau-WT accumulate in similar proportions in these neurons (Silva et al., 2016), suggesting that QC-01\u2013175 targets pathogenic tau conformations that include both WT and A152T tau, rather than tau variant exclusively. As the tau species present in iPSC-derived neurons vary in a differentiation- and maturation-dependent manner, we observed some variability in degradation effect across biological replicates (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013I). To ascertain this inherent variability, we plotted the levels of total tau and P-tauS396 upon 24 hr treatment with 1 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM doses of QC-01\u2013175 across nine independent experiments. QC-01\u2013175 promoted between 50\u00a0and\u00a0100% tau clearance, a statistically significant reduction relative to vehicle (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J). Conversely, the negative control QC-03\u2013075 (Figure 2D) showed no effect on the levels of total tau and P-tauS396 at all concentrations tested, indicating that engagement with CRL4CRBN is required for QC-01\u2013175-mediated tau clearance (Figure 2E,F and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J).",
                        "We employed immunofluorescence (IF) of tau in A152T neurons to assess the effect of treatment with 10 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 for 24 hr. Total tau (K9JA antibody), P-tauS396/S404 (PHF-1 antibody) and neuronal marker MAP2 were imaged, and a clear reduction in tau and P-tau S396/S404 were observed relative to vehicle- or QC-03\u2013075-treated neurons (Figure 2G).",
                        "Next, we tested whether QC-01\u2013175 could degrade multiple FTD-relevant tau species by repeating the ELISA tau quantification assay in tau-P301L neurons. QC-01\u2013175 effected concentration-dependent degradation of total and P-tauS396 at the 24 hr time point, with a Dmax, 24h of 60% achieved at 1 \u03bcM compound for both tau species (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A). QC-03\u2013075 had minimal effect on tau levels (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B). These effects were corroborated by western blotting analysis, where 24 hr treatment with 1 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 resulted in a 70% reduction in total tau and an 80% reduction of P-tauS396, comparable to the effect in A152T neurons, whereas QC-03\u2013075 had no effect on the levels of either tau species (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B). Collectively, these results demonstrate that QC-01\u2013175 targets multiple forms of tau for degradation in FTD neuronal cell models."

                        "To investigate the ability of QC-01\u2013175 to discriminate between normal and disease-associated tau, we tested our degrader against three independent, non-affected iPSC-derived neuronal cell models expressing WT tau, control neurons 1\u20133, in a tau ELISA assay (Figure 2\u2014source data 1). These control neuronal cultures also contain reduced levels of the low-solubility P-tauS396 species present in the FTD-patient-derived neurons (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C vs. A, B) (Silva et al., 2016). No significant degradation of tau or P-tauS396 was observed after 24 hr treatment with either QC-01\u2013175 or negative control QC-03\u2013075 at concentrations up to 1 \u03bcM in all three control neurons (Figure 2H\u2013J). We corroborated these results by western blotting, where 1 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 was unable to induce significant degradation of tau or P-tau after 24 hr in control line 1 (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C). At the highest dose of 10 \u03bcM, QC-01\u2013175 induced\u00a0~20% degradation of total tau in two of the control lines (1 and 2) and had no effect in the third line. Similarly, 10 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 degraded\u00a0~40% of P-tauS396 in control line 1\u00a0and had no significant effect in control lines 2 and 3. Comparative analysis of the effect of QC-01\u2013175 across all cell lines tested suggests that QC-01\u2013175 is significantly more effective at inducing degradation of the forms of tau present in FTD patient-derived neurons (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013E)."

                        "To examine the mechanism of action of QC-01\u2013175, we targeted each component predicted to be required for degrader-mediated tau clearance (Figure 3A\u2013C, top panels). We treated A152T neurons with QC-01\u2013175 at the minimum dose for maximum tau clearance, that\u00a0is 1 \u03bcM for 24 hr (50\u2013100% clearance), with or without pre-treatment for 6 hr with specific inhibitors, followed by western blotting analysis of total tau and P-tauS396. First, excess lenalidomide or T807 that saturate ligand binding sites of CRBN or tau, respectively (Figure 3A), reversed QC-01\u2013175-mediated tau degradation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3A,D). Next, pre-treatment with MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), which inhibits NAE (neddylation activating enzyme NEDD8, and therefore neddylation \u2018N\u2019 of CUL4) (Lan et al., 2016) and consequently E3 ligase activity (Figure 3B), or pre-treatment with the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Figure 3C) (Huang and Dixit, 2016), caused a concentration-dependent rescue of the effect of QC-01\u2013175 (Figure 3B,C,E,F). In contrast, the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf.A1) did not reverse the degrader effect and further promoted tau clearance, possibly as a compensatory response between autophagy and proteasome clearance pathways (Figure 3B,E). The negative control QC-03\u2013075 showed no significant effect on the levels of tau (Figure 3A,B,D,E). All inhibitors were utilized at concentrations that did not affect neuronal viability (data not shown). We also confirmed that QC-01\u2013175 did not significantly affect the levels of CRBN by 24 hr, which remained constant across all concentrations (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D). Taken together, these data establish that QC-01\u2013175-mediated tau degradation is dependent on CRBN and tau binding, neddylation (E3 ligase function) and proteasome function, but not autophagy, consistent with the proposed mechanism of action (Figure 1B).",
                        "As additional controls for specificity, we treated all neurons with the CRBN ligand lenalidomide or the tau ligand T807 at concentrations of 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C,). Across biological replicates, lenalidomide induced a significant up-regulation of P-tauS396 (~30% and 90% at 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM, respectively; Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J) in A152T neurons, indicating that CRBN inhibition alone may lead to accumulation of P-tau in these neurons, which are more sensitive to modulators of the proteasome than healthy neurons (Silva et al., 2016). We also observed that T807 treatment alone could lead to a small upregulation of both total and P-tau (10\u201330%) in A152T neurons (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1J)Jones et al., 2018. Together, these results show that the action of the bifunctional degrader QC-01\u2013175 cannot be recapitulated by treatment with its independent components.",
                        "Next, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in degrader-treated A152T neurons, by pulling down either the CRL4CRBN component DDB1 or tau, to test ternary complex predicted interactions (Figure 1B). We performed this experiment upon 4 hr of 1 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 treatment, under the assumption that maximum engagement would be captured within a shorter interval. To ensure detection of the tau-degrader-CRL4CRBN binding complex before tau clearance occurred, we pre-treated samples with either carfilzomib or bortezomib proteasome inhibitors for 30 min (Huang and Dixit, 2016) to promote accumulation of the complex. Immunoprecipitation of DDB1 and follow-up western blotting analysis showed co-IP with both total tau (TAU5) and P-tau (PHF-1) upon QC-01\u2013175 treatment\u00a0\u00b1carfilzomib (Figure 4A). There was also a weak detection of total tau and P-tau in vehicle and negative control QC-03\u2013075 treated samples, suggesting that some basal interaction between tau and the CRL4CRBN E3 ligase may also occur endogenously in human neurons, as has been reported in tissue from mouse brain (David et al., 2002; Del Prete et al., 2016). Notably, P-tau high-molecular-weight species detected by PHF-1 (see \u2018flow through\u2019 of W:PHF-1, Figure 4A) were not captured by co-IP, which might be caused by bead-antibody alteration of epitope detection or simply low pull-down efficiency of these species in these conditions. Probing with an ubiquitin antibody (W:Ubi-1, Figure 4A) showed an increase in ubiquitinated proteins by QC-01\u2013175\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0carfilzomib treatment, with the same migration as tau (~50 kDa), consistent with a QC-01\u2013175-mediated increase in tau ubiquitination. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of tau (TAU5 antibody) and western blotting analysis showed co-IP with CRBN in QC-01\u2013175 treated samples\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0carfilzomib or bortezomib (Figure 4B). Again, a low level of CRBN-tau interaction was seen for vehicle and negative control QC-03\u2013075-treated samples. CUL4A and DDB1 were also detected by western blotting, particularly in carfilzomib- and bortezomib-treated samples, but at much lower intensity (Figure 4B). Total tau K9JA western blotting was used as a control of tau IP. In both assays, comparison with flow-through control western blotting (notice film exposures, Figure 4A,B) shows that co-IP\u2019ed proteins were a relatively low fraction of the total cellular amount, which was expected given the assay conditions and the transient nature of E3-ligase:substrate complexes. Differences in antibody sensitivities may also affect detection of each component of CRL4CRBN in Figure 4B. IP input-only western blotting analysis confirmed QC-01\u2013175 degradation of tau and P-tau, as well as no effect on tau levels by the vehicle, negative control, or in carfilzomib/bortezomib pre-treated samples (Figure 4C). These results support ternary complex formation between tau, degrader and CRL4CRBN followed by increased tau ubiquitination, at the 4 hr time point, providing further evidence of the mechanism of tau clearance by QC-01\u2013175 through E3 ligase function and proteasome degradation."

For A152T neurons, at the 4 hr time-point we observed a sharp hook effect (Huang and Dixit, 2016) (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A), with maximum clearance of tau and P-tauS396 (Dmax, 4h\u00a0=\u00a080%) at 100 nM (Figure 5A\u2013B), constant 50% degradation at 500 nM and 1 \u03bcM (Figure 5C), and little effect on tau levels at 10 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 (Figure 5D). After 8 hr, the hook effect lessened (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B), and Dmax, 8h of 50% tau was observed at all concentrations above 100 nM (Figure 5A\u2013D). By comparison, at the 24 hr time-point tau and P-tauS396 levels were further reduced in a concentration-dependent manner to a Dmax, 24h of 70% at 10 \u03bcM (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C). The 4 hr effect of QC-01\u2013175 on A152T neurons was corroborated by western blotting analysis (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D,E). In P310L neurons, there was more variability between the two tau species at the 4 hr time-point (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F). For total tau, we observed a hook effect with Dmax, 4h occurring at 100 nM, whereas for P-tauS396 maximal degradation was observed at 500 nM (both Dmax, 4h\u00a0=\u00a080%). However, by 8 hr robust degradation of tau and P-tauS396(40\u201350%) was achieved at all concentrations above 500 nM, and Dmax, 8h was further increased to 60\u201370% by 24 hr (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G,H)."

                        "To identify potential off-targets of the QC-01\u2013175 degrader in the A152T neuronal proteome, we employed multiplexed MS-based proteomics to measure changes in protein abundance following a 4 hr treatment. Short treatments, such as this, enable some control over transcriptional and secondary effects that are often a consequence of prolonged drug exposure. Protein abundances were measured using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labels, enabling the quantification of treatment effects with QC-01\u2013175 (active degrader), QC-03\u2013075 (inactive control), and QC-01\u2013175\u00a0+\u00a0MLN4924 (degradation rescue), relative to vehicle control. Whole proteome analysis resulted in the identification and quantification of\u00a0>8000 proteins with summed signal:noise\u00a0>200 and>2 unique peptides. Upon 4 hr treatment with 1 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175, the only significant changes observed comprise the validated immune-modulatory drug (IMiD) targets ZFP91, ZNF653 and ZNF827 (Donovan et al., 2018), while no QC-01\u2013175 specific off-targets were observed (Figure 6A). Degradation of these C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors was expected as an off-target response to the CRBN-binding module of QC-01\u2013175 (pomalidomide, Figure 1C). Conversely, the negative control QC-03\u2013075 (1 \u03bcM) revealed no effect on these proteins, confirming the ablation of CRBN-binding activity (Figure 6B). The degradation rescue experiment, consisting of pre-treatment with the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 (inhibits activation of all NEDD8-dependent CRL) (Lan et al., 2016) and QC-01\u2013175, showed a complete rescue of IMiD target degradation, confirming the neddylation and hence cullin-dependence for target degradation (Figure 6C). These results confirmed that QC-01\u2013175 has minimal off-target activity. We were unable to reliably quantify tau by proteomics since the solubilization procedure necessary to dissolve insoluble tau species is incompatible with our pipeline."

                        "In FTD patient-derived neuronal cell models, accumulation of tau and P-tau of reduced solubility is coupled to increased cellular vulnerability to specific forms of stress (Silva et al., 2016). One of these stressors is the proteotoxicity caused by the highly aggregation-prone peptide A\u03b2(1-42), which promotes a concentration-dependent loss of viability in A152T and P301L neurons (Figure 7A). This effect on viability is not seen in WT control neurons and can be rescued by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated MAPT knockout (KO) in A152T neurons (Figure 7A) (Silva et al., 2016). We tested whether QC-01\u2013175 could similarly protect against tau-mediated stress vulnerability and loss of viability. A152T neurons were pre-treated with either 5 \u03bcM QC-01\u2013175 or 5 \u03bcM QC-03\u2013075 (Figure 7B b), or vehicle alone (DMSO, Figure 7B c) for 8 hr, followed by addition of 10 \u03bcM A\u03b2(1-42) stressor for an additional 16 hr (Figure 7B b, c). Vehicle- and degrader-only treated samples were also included as controls (Figure 7B a). Vehicle pre-treated neurons followed by A\u03b2(1-42) treatment loss 50% viability at the 24 hr time-point (Figure 7C). QC-01\u2013175 pre-treatment rescued viability to 90% of vehicle-alone control, almost phenocopying the 100% viability rescue observed in MAPT KO neurons (Figure 7C). The negative control QC-03\u2013075 had little effect on the toxicity of A\u03b2(1-42). As expected, 24 hr treatment with either QC-01\u2013175 or negative control alone caused no change in neuronal viability (Figure 7C, left blue bars).",

            "paragraphs": [
                "In this study, we established that disease-relevant forms of tau and P-tau in FTD patient-derived neuronal cell models are amenable to targeted degradation and characterize the tool compound QC-01\u2013175 as an effective tau degrader. We developed a BLI in vitro assay to assess QC-01\u2013175 binding to recombinant tau species relative to T807. Despite detecting binding, QC-01\u2013175 and T807 showed micromolar affinities to immobilized, soluble protein, independent of the presence of a tau variant. E. coli-expressed and purified recombinant human tau has distinct properties that are not reflective of intracellular protein conformations, which may be key to the recognition, binding and degradation of tau by QC-01\u2013175 in the neuronal context. This is a limitation of current heterologous cell culture systems and in vitro measurements that do not recapitulate endogenous cellular tau properties. This highlights the importance of assaying disease-relevant tau species and an urgent need for improved biophysical binding assays. Introducing patient-specific neuronal models that recapitulate early aspects of tau pathology ex vivo in a drug discovery pipeline is unique to this study. Human stem cell-derived neurons allow access to physiologically relevant cell types and protein complexes, offering the advantage of modeling pathogenic tau species without the need for overexpression of heterologous genes, in the context of the patient genomic background (Dolmetsch and Geschwind, 2011; Silva et al., 2017; Wan et al., 2015; Chesselet and Carmichael, 2012). QC-01\u2013175 was able to promote tau clearance in FTD neurons expressing tau-A152T or tau-P301L, in a concentration-dependent manner, and subsequently rescued tau-mediated neuronal stress vulnerability. The effect of QC-01\u2013175 in A152T and P301L heterozygous neurons led on average to more than 70% and 60% clearance of tau, respectively, when only about 50% of tau expressed has the variant. This is informative regarding the species of tau targeted by the degrader, raising the hypothesis that some forms of non-mutant tau in FTD neurons are also misfolded and targeted for degradation. Remarkably, the degrader preferentially targeted tau species from FTD neurons, with minimal effect on tau from unaffected WT control neurons. This indicates that it may be possible to develop tau-degrader therapies that selectively act in FTD-affected neurons, and on disease-associated forms of tau, independent of genotype, and spare normal tau protein within the affected regions of the brain.",
                "Variation in QC-01\u2013175-mediated tau degradation dose profiles between A152T and P301L neurons (Figure 2C and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A) points to differences in tau species originated by the two tau variants, and possibly also differences in proteostasis for the two patient-derived cell models, which affects UPS function. This aspect will impact the clinical translational potential of any degrader targeting tau to the proteasome, which has been demonstrated to be affected by neurodegeneration and aging itself (Deger et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2003; Saez and Vilchez, 2014). This, however, does not preclude the development of targeted degraders as therapeutic strategies for early stage disease, or as a co-therapeutic with proteasome activity chemical enhancers (Myeku and Duff, 2018). Notably, co-IP results (Figure 4) suggest that there is a basal level of interaction between tau and the CRL4CRBN E3 ligase in A152T neurons. Interestingly, Del Prete et al. reported that tau could be a natural substrate of CRBN through a complex involving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), mutations in which are known to cause AD (Del Prete et al., 2016). The co-IP experiment data we present here indicates that in FTD there may also be some basal tau:CRBN association, and thus, rather than targeting a \u2018neo-substrate\u2019, QC-01\u2013175 may be promoting efficacy of a physiological process, increasing the probability of successful tau degradation in vivo. Further work is needed to investigate this hypothesis.",
                "Important challenges still remain for translation of our promising initial findings into a therapeutic. From a pharmacology standpoint, QC-01\u2013175 is a relatively large and flexible molecule compared to most brain-active drugs and may suffer from fast metabolism and poor brain penetration. Tuning pharmacology for in vivo applications is an ongoing challenge in the targeted protein degradation field, but progress is being made (Gu et al., 2018). If this tuning proves intractable, intrathecal administration could be considered. Clinical biomarkers for target engagement and efficacy evaluation will also be critical. Since QC-01\u2013175\u00a0occupies the binding site of a PET ligand, it might be possible to use PET to measure target engagement in vivo. However, because degraders can act catalytically, their pharmacodynamics may influence and complicate PET readings. Further evaluation of QC-01\u2013175 off-target binding will also be crucial. The degrader can recognize and downregulate other proteins as shown here by mass spectrometry global proteome analysis (Figure 6A), where three C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors were downregulated by a 4 hr treatment with QC-01\u2013175. This off-target activity likely arises from the CRBN-binding module of QC-01\u2013175 (pomalidomide, Figure 1C), which has been reported to induce degradation of multiple members of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family through a \u2018molecular glue\u2019 type mechanism (Sievers et al., 2018). Since these are lesser-known transcription factors, the cellular implications of their degradation are not yet fully understood. Using what is known about IMiD-based degrader design, efforts to design next generation tau degraders will involve tuning the attachment chemistry to replace the aniline nitrogen, and altering the degrader linker composition to remove these IMiD off-target effects (Nowak et al., 2018; Dobrovolsky et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2019), thus creating a tau-selective degrader. These efforts are currently underway in our laboratory. However, QC-01\u2013175 may also have modulatory effect on function/activity of other proteins without leading to degradation. Here, we tested and excluded the known MAO inhibitory effect of T807, but one could speculate that other enzymes (e.g. kinases) could be affected in vivo. Therefore, a detailed profiling of off-target binding interactions is a necessary future investigative effort. Finally, since it is now possible to routinely establish patient specific iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, an interesting strategy for clinical trial success might be to screen individual patients for responsiveness using cellular models.",
                "In conclusion, here we have established a neurodegeneration-specific workflow for development of targeted degraders for aggregation-prone proteins. Our workflow leveraged existing PET probe binders in degrader design, and well-characterized patient-derived neuronal models to assay against clinically relevant protein species and phenotypes. These efforts yielded QC-01\u2013175, a valuable new research tool for the study of tau-mediated events in human tauopathies. PET-tracer-based hetero-bifunctional degrader design and patient-derived cellular models offer an unprecedented advantage for the targeting of pathologically\u00a0relevant tau species, relative to in vitro and heterologous expression systems. Additionally, we anticipate that future advances in understanding the relationship between tau post-translational modifications and adopted conformations in disease, as well as visualizing and modeling interactions between tau and various PET tracers, will aid in the knowledge-based design of next generation targeted degraders. Importantly, our approach may be generalizable to other proteinopathies where high-quality PET tracers and cellular models are available. In this context, our study suggests that small-molecule-mediated protein degradation represents a promising strategy to advance our understanding of human neurodegenerative disease and translate those insights into targeted therapies."

Recombinant human tau proteins (Tau-441(WT), Tau-441(A152T) and Tau-441(P301L), 2N4R isoform) were purchased from SignalChem (Richmond, British Columbia). Tau-441(WT), Tau-441(A152T) and Tau-441(P301L) were labeled with biotin using the EZ-LinkNHS-PEG4-Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and excess biotin reagent was removed using a spin desalting column as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The biotinylated protein samples for BLI were purified in 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Streptavidin (SA) sensors were used to measure the biophysical interaction between the small molecules and biotinylated tau. Prior to the initiation of BLI, the SA sensors were soaked by dipping in 200 \u03bcL of assay buffer in a 96-well Greiner Bio-One Black flat bottom plate (Greiner, Monroe NC, USA Cat.655209). The assay was performed in 80 \u03bcL volume in Greiner Bio-One 384-well black flat bottom PP plates (Greiner, Cat.781209) with an initial baseline step, followed by loading of 250 nM biotinylated tau protein. The small molecules samples and recombinant proteins were arranged in the 384-well plate according to a plate map recommended for the eight-channel mode kinetic analysis, where the sensors move from low to high concentration of small molecule samples. Subsequent steps included a second baseline (120 s), followed by association (240 s) and dissociation (240 s) cycles. All the sensors were loaded with biotinylated tau protein, and two sensors were loaded with appropriate concentration of DMSO (comparable to small molecule samples) in assay buffer to be used as reference. Data analysis was performed using Data Acquisition HT 11.0 software following reference subtraction (an average of two sensors with DMSO) using a 1:1 binding model and an individual fit of each replicate. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was estimated using data at equilibrium from each available small molecule concentration with steady-state analysis. The instrument manufacturer (Fortebio, article #137) recommends the steady state option for analyzing interactions that are either low affinity or very fast on-and-off affinity rates. For steady-state analysis of \u2018R equilibrium\u2019 (Req) was fitted according to 1:1 binding model with the equation Response = (Rmaxx Conc.)/(KD\u00a0+\u00a0Conc.). When Req option is selected, Fortebio\u2019s software calculates affinity constants based on the Req values determined from the curve fits. In the steady-state analysis, Req is plotted against the small molecule concentration to infer the Rmax. KD is estimated as the concentration where 50% of Rmax is achieved. As per the instrument manufacturer\u2019s instructions, if all curves have reached equilibrium, these two sets of values correspond to \u2018Response,\u2019 and Req values should match. For T807 and QC-01\u2013175, the values of \u2018Response\u2019 and Req match as evidenced by the raw data as well as a value of Rmax/Req (%) close to 1."

                        "NPCs were plated and differentiated for 6 weeks, as described above, in six-well POL-coated plates. For each pull-down experiment, three wells of treated neurons were PBS-washed and combined into a single pellet. To stabilize and detect complex formation, all steps were performed on ice or at 4\u00b0C. Co-IP was performed with the Immunoprecipitation Kit Dynabeads Protein G (Novex by Life Technologies/Thermo 10007D), according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, cell lysis was achieved with ice cold Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant (Input) was transferred to a new tube and immediately aliquoted for the BCA assay to determine protein concentration. Antibodies, 10 \u03bcg of TAU5 and 5 \u03bcg of DDB1, were bound to Dynabeads (1.5 mg) per each condition to be tested (treatments). Immunoprecipitation of the target antigen (tau or DDB1) was performed by mixing protein lysate (200 \u03bcL sample corresponding to 300 \u03bcg of total protein) to each Dynabeads-antibody complex. All other steps followed the kit\u2019s protocol. Elution was accomplished with 20 \u03bcL Elution Buffer and 10 \u03bcL of SDS-sample buffer with DTT (New England Biolabs), followed by removal of the magnetic beads. A volume of 10 \u03bcL of each IP sample was loaded onto SDS-PAGE for western blotting as described above."

                                "A152T neurons at 6 weeks of differentiation were treated with DMSO vehicle, 1 \u00b5M of degrader QC-01\u2013175 or 1 \u00b5M negative control QC-03\u2013075 in biological triplicates for 4 hr, or pre-treated for 30 min with 10 \u00b5M MLN4924 followed by 1 \u00b5M QC-01\u2013175 addition for 3.5 hr, in biological duplicates. Neuronal cells were washed in PBS (Corning VWR, Radnor, PA) and collected at 3000 g centrifugation. Lysis buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM 4-(2hydroxyethyl)\u22121-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (EPPS) pH 8.5, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche) were added to the cell pellets and homogenized by 20 passes through a 21 gauge (1.25 in. long) needle to achieve a cell lysate with a protein concentration between 0.25\u20132 mg/mL. A micro-BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine final protein concentration in the cell lysates. 100 \u00b5g of protein for each sample were reduced and alkylated as previously described (Donovan et al., 2018). Proteins were precipitated using methanol/chloroform. In brief, four volumes of methanol were added to the cell lysate, followed by one volume of chloroform, and finally three volumes of water. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged to separate the chloroform phase from the aqueous phase. The precipitated protein was washed with three volumes of methanol, centrifuged and the resulting washed precipitated protein was allowed to air dry. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 4 M Urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, followed by dilution to 1 M urea with the addition of 200 mM EPPS, pH 8. Proteins were first digested with LysC (1:50; enzyme:protein; Fisher Scientific) for 12 hr at room temperature. The LysC digestion was diluted to 0.5 M Urea with 200 mM EPPS pH eight followed by digestion with trypsin (1:50; enzyme:protein; Promega) for 6 hr at 37\u00b0C. Tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Anhydrous ACN was added to each peptide sample to a final concentration of 30% v/v, and labeling was induced with the addition of TMT reagent to each sample at a ratio of 1:4 peptide:TMT label. The 11-plex labeling reactions were performed for 1.5 hr at room temperature and the reaction quenched by the addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% for 15 min at room temperature. The sample channels were combined at a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, desalted using C18 solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) and analyzed by LC-MS for channel ratio comparison. Samples were then combined using the adjusted volumes determined in the channel ratio analysis and dried down in a speed vacuum. The combined sample was then resuspended in 1% formic acid and acidified (pH 2\u20133) before being subjected to desalting with C18 SPE (Sep-Pak, Waters). Samples were then offline fractionated into 96 fractions by high-pH reverse-phase HPLC (Agilent LC1260, Santa Clara, CA) through an aeris peptide xb-c18 column (phenomenex) with mobile phase A containing 5% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O, and mobile phase B containing 90% acetonitrile and 10 mM NH4HCO3 in LC-MS grade H2O (both pH 8.0). The 96 resulting fractions were then pooled in a non-continuous manner into 24 fractions and these fractions were used for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis.",

Peptides were separated on an EasySpray ES803 75 \u03bcm inner diameter microcapillary column (ThermoFisher Scientific). Peptides were separated using a 190 min gradient of 6\u201327% acetonitrile in 1.0% formic acid with a flow rate of 350 nL/min. Each analysis used an MS3-based TMT method as described previously (McAlister et al., 2014). The data were acquired using a mass range of m/z 340\u20131350, resolution 120,000, AGC target 5 \u00d7 105, maximum injection time 100 ms, dynamic exclusion of 120 s for the peptide measurements in the Orbitrap. Data dependent MS2 spectra were acquired in the ion trap with a normalized collision energy (NCE) set at 35%, AGC target set to 1.8 \u00d7 104 and a maximum injection time of 120 ms. MS3 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with HCD collision energy set to 55%, AGC target set to 2 \u00d7 105, maximum injection time of 150 ms, resolution at 50,000 and with a maximum synchronous precursor selection (SPS) precursors set to 10. The Advanced Peak Detection (APD) algorithm was disabled."

MS/MS spectra were searched against a Uniprot human database (September 2016) with both the forward and reverse sequences. Database search criteria are as follows: tryptic with two missed cleavages, a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.6 Da, static alkylation of cysteine (57.0211 Da), static TMT labeling of lysine residues and N-termini of peptides (229.163 Da), variable oxidation of methionine (15.9951 Da), variable phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine (79.966 Da) and variable acetylation (42.011 Da), Methionine-loss (131.040 Da) or methionine-loss\u00a0+\u00a0acetylation (83.030 Da) of the protein N-terminus. TMT reporter ion intensities were measured using a 0.003 Da window around the theoretical m/z for each reporter ion in the MS3 scan. Peptide spectral matches with poor quality MS3 spectra were excluded from quantitation (summed signal-to-noise across 11 channels\u00a0<\u00a0200 and precursor isolation specificity\u00a0<\u00a00.5), and resulting data was filtered to only include proteins that had a minimum of two unique peptides identified. Reporter ion intensities were normalized and scaled using in-house scripts in the R framework (Team RCR: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing http://www.R-project.org/; accessed Nov. 1, 2017). Statistical analysis was carried out using the limma package within the R framework (Ritchie et al., 2015)."
