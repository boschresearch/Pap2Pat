# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to bifunctional compounds that bind tau protein and promote its degradation via recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and uses of the compounds in the treatment of neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease).

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of memory and other mental functions. Worldwide, nearly 35 million people suffer from AD. The exact mechanism for AD is not fully understood, but two characteristic protein deposits, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), have been defined as causative events for AD. While senile plaques include extracellular aggregation of amyloidβ peptides (Aβ), the NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Since tau accumulation begins before extensive neuronal loss, targeting tau protein has become a strategy for treating AD. Hence, tau is not only a drug target but also a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD by measurement of brain tau loading. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique that provides a non-invasive diagnostic method for the detection of tau aggregation. Thus, several tau radiotracers have been developed and tested in humans.

Recently, a new therapeutic strategy to reduce and/or eliminate proteins associated with certain pathological states, PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeras; e.g., see U.S. Patent Application, U.S. Ser. No. 14/792,414, filed Jul. 6, 2015), was developed by creating bifunctional compounds that recruit target proteins to E3 ubiquitin ligases, which subsequently induce proteasome-mediated degradation of the target protein. E3 ubiquitin ligases are proteins that, in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, promote the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine on a target protein via an isopeptide bond (e.g., an amide bond that is not present on the main chain of a protein). The ubiquitination of the protein commonly results in degradation of the target protein by the proteasome.

Currently, there are no clinically approved compounds that target tau for the treatment of AD, and overall clinical failure is much higher for AD compared to other diseases. Accordingly, an ongoing need exists to identify drugs that effectively treat neurological disorders, such as AD. In particular, drugs that can take advantage of cellular machinery involved in protein homeostasis (e.g., ubiquitination and proteasome degradation) may find use as therapeutic agents.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

PROTAC relies on a strategy of recruiting target protein to an E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequently inducing proteasome-mediated degradation of the target protein. The present disclosure describes the conjugation of tau binding moieties with an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety (e.g., lenalidomide, thalidomide) to provide compounds that can induce the ubiquitination of tau protein and promote its degradation in cells. Accordingly, the present disclosure stems from the recognition that the aggregation of tau protein, in particular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, causes certain neurological disorders (e.g., tauopathies such as AD), and that by targeting both tau protein, or any post-translationally modified form of tau, and recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase (e.g., Cereblon) to ubiquitinate the tau protein and mark it for proteasome degradation, a single bifunctional compound can promote the degradation of tau protein, thus providing new compounds, compostions, and methods for the treatment of neurological disease (e.g., tauopathies such as AD). Thus, the present disclosure represents an important advance in the treatment of neurological disease, particularly tauopathies.

The term “leaving group” is given its ordinary meaning in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and refers to an atom or a group capable of being displaced by a nucleophile. See, for example, Smith, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry 6th ed. (501-502). Examples of suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen (such as F, Cl, Br, or I (iodine)), alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, alkanesulfonyloxy, arenesulfonyloxy, alkyl-carbonyloxy (e.g., acetoxy), arylcarbonyloxy, aryloxy, methoxy, N,O-dimethylhydroxylamino, pixyl, and haloformates.

In some cases, the leaving group is a brosylate, such as p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy. In some cases, the leaving group is a nosylate, such as 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy. The leaving group may also be a phosphineoxide (e.g., formed during a Mitsunobu reaction) or an internal leaving group such as an epoxide or cyclic sulfate. Other non-limiting examples of leaving groups are water, ammonia, alcohols, ether moieties, thioether moieties, zinc halides, magnesium moieties, diazonium salts, and copper moieties.

These and other exemplary substituents are described in more detail in the Detailed Description, Examples, and claims. The invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents.

### Other Definitions

The following definitions are more general terms used throughout the present application.

As used herein, the term “salt” refers to any and all salts, and encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid or with organic acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, or malonic acid or by using other methods known in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, and N+(C1-4 alkyl)4− salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate, and aryl sulfonate.

The term “solvate” refers to forms of the compound, or a salt thereof, that are associated with a solvent, usually by a solvolysis reaction. This physical association may include hydrogen bonding. Conventional solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, DMSO, THF, diethyl ether, and the like. The compounds described herein may be prepared, e.g., in crystalline form, and may be solvated. Suitable solvates include pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and further include both stoichiometric solvates and non-stoichiometric solvates. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example, when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Representative solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, and methanolates.

The term “hydrate” refers to a compound that is associated with water. Typically, the number of the water molecules contained in a hydrate of a compound is in a definite ratio to the number of the compound molecules in the hydrate. Therefore, a hydrate of a compound may be represented, for example, by the general formula R.x H2O, wherein R is the compound, and x is a number greater than 0. A given compound may form more than one type of hydrate, including, e.g., monohydrates (x is 1), lower hydrates (x is a number greater than 0 and smaller than 1, e.g., hemihydrates (R.0.5 H2O)), and polyhydrates (x is a number greater than 1, e.g., dihydrates (R.2 H2O) and hexahydrates (R.6 H2O)).

The term “tautomers” or “tautomeric” refers to two or more interconvertible compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency (e.g., a single bond to a double bond, a triple bond to a single bond, or vice versa). The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Tautomerizations (i.e., the reaction providing a tautomeric pair) may catalyzed by acid or base. Exemplary tautomerizations include keto-to-enol, amide-to-imide, lactam-to-lactim, enamine-to-imine, and enamine-to-(a different enamine) tautomerizations.

It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”.

Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”.

The term “polymorph” refers to a crystalline form of a compound (or a salt, hydrate, or solvate thereof). All polymorphs have the same elemental composition. Different crystalline forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Various polymorphs of a compound can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.

The term “prodrugs” refers to compounds that have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds described herein, which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like. Other derivatives of the compounds described herein have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offer advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well known to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides, and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds described herein are particular prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. C1-8 alkyl, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, aryl, C7-12 substituted aryl, and C7-12 arylalkyl esters of the compounds described herein may be preferred.

**Group E**

E is an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety. E is inclusive of all moieties that bind, or can bind, any E3 ubiquitin ligase. For example, in certain embodiments, E is capable of binding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as Cereblon or von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). In certain embodiments, E is capable of binding to multiple different E3 ubiquitin ligases. In certain embodiments, E binds to Cereblon. In certain embodiments, E binds to VHL.

Human Cereblon (CRBN) is a protein of 442 amino acids with an apparent molecular weight of ˜51 kDa (GenBank: AAH17419). (For the CRBN protein sequence see: Higgins et al., Neurology. 2004, 63, 1927-31. For additional information related to the CRBN structure see Hartmann et al., PLoS One. 2015, 10, e0128342.) Human CRBN contains the N-terminal part (237-amino acids from 81 to 317) of ATP-dependent Lon protease domain without the conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs, 11 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 1 N-linked glycosylation site, and 2 myristoylation sites. CRBN is widely expressed in testis, spleen, prostate, liver, pancreas, placenta, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, ovary, small intestine, peripheral blood leukocyte, colon, brain, and retina. CRBN is located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and peripheral membrane. (Chang et al., Int. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2011, 2, 287-94.)

Cereblon is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and it forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), Cullin-4A (CUL4A), and regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1). This complex ubiquitinates a number of other proteins. Through a mechanism which has not been completely elucidated, Cereblon ubiquitination of target proteins results in increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). FGF8, in turn, regulates a number of developmental processes, such as limb and auditory vesicle formation.

In certain embodiments, E is a modulator, binder, inhibitor, or ligand of Cereblon. In certain embodiments, E is a modulator of Cereblon. In certain embodiments, E is a binder of Cereblon.

The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. VHL comprises the substrate recognition subunit/E3 ubiquitin ligase complex VCB, which includes elongins B and C, and a complex including Cullin-2 and Rbxl. The primary substrate of VHL is Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor that upregulates genes, such as the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF and the red blood cell-inducing cytokine, erythropoietin, in response to low oxygen levels. VCB is a known target in cancer, chronic anemia, and ischemia.

The full-length von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) contains 213 amino acids. (For the VHL protein sequence see: Duan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995, 92, 6459-63. For additional information related to the VHL structure see Stebbins et al., Science 1999, 284, 455-61 and Minervini et al., Sci. Rep. 2015, 5, 12605.) A second VHL-gene product arises by internal translation initiation from the codon 54 methionine, producing a 160 amino-acid protein (“pVHL19”). VHL has two main structural domains: an N-terminal domain composed mainly of β-sheets (α-domain) and a smaller C-terminal domain between amino acids 155-192 composed mainly of α helices (α-domain). The α-domain consists of three a helices that combines with a fourth α helix donated by elongin C. The β-domain is on the opposite side of the a domain and is free to contact other protein.

In certain embodiments, E is a modulator, binder, inhibitor, or ligand of VHL. In certain embodiments, E is a modulator of VHL. In certain embodiments, E is a binder of VHL. In certain embodiments, E is an inhibitor of VHL. In certain embodiments, E is a ligand of Cereblon. In certain embodiments, E is any ligand of VHL listed in Galdeano, C. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2014, 57, 8657, which is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, E is a modulator, binder, inhibitor, or ligand of a VHL variant. In certain embodiments, E is a modulator, binder, inhibitor, or ligand of a VHL isoform. In certain embodiments, E is a modulator, binder, inhibitor, or ligand of a VHL gene-product (e.g., pVHL19).

### Methods of Treatment

Major neuropathology observations of postmortem examination of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains confirm the presence of AD through the detection of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). NFTs derive from filaments of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. The presence and severity of NFTs generally but not always correlates with the severity of dementia and cognitive impairment, and it has become clear that the pathological process of AD begins before the presentation of the clinical symptoms of dementia and the late stage NFTs. Therefore, reduction and/or elimination of aberrant tau species preceding NFTs, or NFTs themselves, by tau protein degradation is an attractive method for the treatment of AD and other tauopathies.

Immunomodulatory agents, including thalidomide and lenalidomide, bind Cereblon.

### Diagnostic Methods

The pathological development of tauopathies often begin before presentation of clinical symptoms, thus in vivo imaging of aberrant and/or aggregated tau protein may be useful for the early and accurate diagnosis of neurological disease. In particular, the pathological process of AD begins before the presentation of the clinical symptoms of dementia, and in vivo imaging of aberrant tau and NFTs may be useful for the early and accurate diagnosis of AD. Quantitative evaluation of tau pathology could also be helpful for tracking and predicting severity of dementia, because the formation of neuritic pathology correlates with clinical severity of dementia. The compounds of the present disclosure recognize pathological forms of tau, which includes forms containing excessively phosphorylated tau protein as a constituent ingredient as well as aberrant high-molecular weight species formed from tau and other post-translational modifications, and thus the compounds can be used as a probe for the detection of aberrant tau relevant to neurodegeneration. Thus, imaging techniques in conjunction with novel treatments that prevent or reduce the pathological formation of neurofibrillary pathology would be useful for the evaluation of treatment efficacy.

In certain embodiments, the present disclosure relates to radiolabeled compounds of Formula I as imaging agents. These imaging agents are useful as they contain tau protein binding moieties that interact with and bind to tau protein, providing the ability to image aggregated tau protein in vivo. As the compounds of Formula I lead to the degradation of tau protein by regular administration, progression of the therapeutic effect of the compounds of Formula I may be monitored through the use of radiolabeled forms of the compounds or other known imaging agents for tau protein.

In certain embodiments, the imaging is achieved by employing a fluorescence imaging technique or a nuclear imaging technique selected from the group consisting of positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the fluorescence imaging technique and/or nuclear imaging technique for monitoring or visualizing a distribution of the radiolabeled or tagged compound within the central nervous system or within a portion thereof (e.g., the brain).

PET and SPECT utilize radiolabeled compounds. PET and SPECT are sensitive techniques and require small quantities of radiolabeled compounds, or tracers. The labeled compounds are transported, accumulated and converted in vivo in exactly the same way as the corresponding non-radioactively compound. Tracers, or probes, can be radiolabeled with a radionuclide useful for PET imaging, such as 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F, 64Cu and 124I, or with a radionuclide useful for SPECT imaging, such as 99Tc, 77Br, 61Cu, 153Gd, 123I, 125I, 131I and 32P.

PET creates images based on the distribution of molecular imaging tracers carrying positron-emitting isotopes in the tissue of the patient. The PET method has the potential to detect malfunction on a cellular level in the investigated tissues or organs. PET has been used in clinical oncology, such as for the imaging of tumors and metastases, and has been used for diagnosis of certain brain diseases, as well as mapping brain and heart function. Similarly, SPECT can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, for example, imaging tumor, infection (leukocyte), thyroid or bones.

### Tau Degradation Assays

Assays were performed to demonstrate the ability of the exemplary compounds to degrade tau in human cells. Compounds employed as controls in the experiments described below include the following:

Example compounds 1-12 were evaluated for their ability to degrade tau protein in cultured human differentiated frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTD) neurons. Several exemplary compounds significantly degraded hyperphosphorylated tau and total tau in human tau-A152T neurons (5-week differentiated) and tau-P301L neurons (8-week differentiated) after treatment of the neurons with the compounds for 24 hours (FIGS. 1, 2, and 8-10). For each condition, 1 well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bio-Products) with 2% SDS (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini tablets), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), followed by sonication in a water sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonic Baths, Thomas Scientific) for 5 min, and centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, total protein concentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo), and SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with lOug total protein per well (pre-boiled samples). Western blots were performed with the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System (Invitrogen). All samples were resolved in 7% Tris-Acetate gels with Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies against total tau (TAUS) and phosphosrylated tau (Ser396), along with β-actin as a loading control; followed by corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Whereas the vehicle alone (DMSO) had no effect on tau, varying degrading activity was observed amongst the compounds, however with overall similar relative levels of degrading activity between tau-A152T neurons and tau-P301L neurons. Compounds were added at the doses indicated of either 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 μM. Lenalidomide (1 μM or 10 μM) was also evaluated as a control in some experiments since it binds CRBN but should not engage tau, as confirmed by having no effect on tau levels.

The effect of the tau binding moiety, T807, was also evaluated in a control experiment since it should not recruit tau to CRBN as it does not bind CRBN. Four-week differentiated neurons, both non-mutant (8330-8) and tau-A152T (19-5-RC6) were employed. The neurons were treated with T807 for 24 hours (at 10 μg/mL=59.4 μM). One well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate, treated or untreated) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and directly lysed in 200 μL of Sample Buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 3× DTT, boiled for 15 min and 10 μL of each lysate was run by SDS-PAGE in a 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, with MOPS running buffer. Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (DA9) and phosphorylated tau (Ser396, PHF1, AT8) along with GAPDH as a loading control. The results of this experiment showed that T807 had no effect on tau levels and did not degrade tau (FIG. 3). Complementarily, FIG. 5 also showed no effect of T807 on tau and phosphorylated tau, when treated concomitantly with other exemplary compounds at the same dose of 1 μM.

Example compounds 2-5 were reevaluated for their ability to degrade tau protein in human FTD neurons as well as evaluate their effect on E3 ubiquitin ligases CRBN, VHL, and CHIP (FIG. 4A-E). For each control and treatment, 1 well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bio-Products) with 2% SDS (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini tablets), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), followed by sonication in a water sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonic Baths, Thomas Scientific) for 5 min, and centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, total protein concentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo), and SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with 10 pg total protein per well (pre-boiled samples). Western blots were performed with the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System (Invitrogen), with gradient 4-12% Bis-Tris gels with MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies to CRBN, VHL, CHIP and total tau (TAUS), along with (3-actin as a loading control; followed by corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Whereas the vehicle alone (DMSO) had no effect on tau, several of the compounds significantly degraded hyperphosphorylated tau and total tau in human tau-A152T neurons (5-week differentiated) and tau-P301L neurons (8-week differentiated). Lenalidomide was also evaluated as a control, and it had no effect on tau levels. In addition, the exemplary compounds did not have an effect on CRBN, but did have an effect on VHL and CHIP. The assay also confirmed significant tau accumulation in A152T and P301L neurons. In FTD neurons (A152T and P301L), tau accumulation leads to disruption of specific proteostasis pathways, which include upregulation of CHIP and VHL. For CHIP, the compounds with highest potency for tau degradation also caused a decrease in CHIP levels. This may be an indication that CRBN is a stable and useful target for degraders of tau protein in human neurons.

Example compounds 2-5 were again evaluated in tau degradation assays in non-mutant control, A152T and P301L neurons (6-week differentiated). Non-mutant neurons were employed as a negative control since derivatives of T807 should not recognize non-disease states of tau based upon how the series was identified, using selection for binding to pathological forms of tau in post-mortem brain lysates and tissue slices. In addition, T807, lenalidomide, and QC-03-075 were employed as controls along with the vehicle (DMSO). As QC-03-075 does not bind to CRBN it should act as a negative control. For each condition, 1 well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bio-Products) with 2% SDS (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini tablets), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), followed by sonication in a water sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonic Baths, Thomas Scientific) for 5 min, and centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, total protein concentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo), and SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with 10 μg total protein per well (pre-boiled samples). Western blots were performed with the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System (Invitrogen) and samples were resolved in 7% Tris-Acetate gels with Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (TAU5), phospho-tau (S396) and CRBN along with GAPDH as a loading control; followed by corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Assay results again confirmed the ability of the exemplary compounds to be effective degraders of pathological forms of tau while having little effect on levels of tau in non-mutant tau neurons (FIG. 5A-C). These results were confirmed by three biological replicates (FIG. 5C).

Example compounds 2, 3, and 5 were evaluated to determine time and dose-dependency effect on the degradation of tau in 6-week differentiated A152T neurons (FIG. 6A-B). For each condition, one well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate, treated or untreated) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and directly lysed in 150 μL of Sample Buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 3× DTT, boiled for 15 min and 10 μL of each lysate was run by SDS-PAGE in a Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE System (Invitrogen) with 7% Tris-Acetate gels and Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (TAUS), and phospho-tau (S396), along with GAPDH as a loading control; followed by HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Upon compound treatment, no toxicity or detachment were detected. The results confirmed the findings of the previous assays described above and showed that compounds 2 and 3 have a dose dependent effect on tau after treatment for 24 hours.

Example compounds 2, 3, and 5 were also evaluated for their ability to rescue stress vulnerability in Al 52T neurons differentiated for 8 weeks. QC-03-075 was employed as negative control. Compound 3 showed that it is effective at rescuing stress vulnerability caused by exposure of neurons to 10 μM β-amyloid (1-42) peptide for 16 h, when these neurons were pre-treated with Compound 3 for 8h prior to stress exposure (FIG. 7). The results also demonstrated that example Compounds 2, 3, and 5 had no effect on neuronal viability (FIG. 7) as for Silva et al. (Stem Cell Reports, 2016, 7(3), 325-40; doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.08.001) reduction of viability due to β-amyloid (1-42) exposure is dependent on tau levels.

### In Vivo Assay

To determine whether the compounds of the present disclosure are capable of crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), a key property for use of these compounds as CNS therapeutics, compound 3 was administered to mice in a pharmacokinetic study of plasma and brain tissue. A stable formulation compatible with chronic administration was prepared prior to administration, and analytical methods for measuring concentration of the compound in plasma and brain tissue were developed. Mice were additionally monitored for tolerability for up to 24 hours.

Animal Husbandry: Male CD-1 mice were group housed during a 2-3 day acclimation prior to the study at an animal room environment with a controlled environment (target conditions: temperature 18-26° C., relative humidity 30-70%, 12 hours artificial light and 12 hours dark). All animals had access to Certified Rodent Diet and water ad libitum.

Formulation & Dosing: Compound 3 (QC-01-175) was formulated at 5.00 mg/mL in 20% PEG400 in water producing a clear, stable solution. For intraperitoneal (IP) dosing, the dose formulation was administered with a dose volume determined by the animals' body weight collected on the morning of dosing day.

Sample Collection & Processing:

Blood Samples: A blood sample (about 0.03 mL per time point) was collected from each mouse into polypropylene tubes at each timepoint. All blood samples were transferred into pre-chilled commercial EDTA-K2 tubes or pre-chilled plastic microcentrifuge tubes containing 2 μL of EDTA-K2 as anti-coagulant and placed on wet ice until centrifugation. Each collected blood sample was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4° C. and 3000 g for plasma collection. Plasma from each mouse was transferred into a pre-labeled polypropylene tube in dry ice at each time point. After terminal collection, all plasmas were stored at approximately −80° C. until bioanalysis.

Brain Samples: Whole brain was dissected at each designated time point and rinsed twice cold in deionized water before processing. They were then blotted on filter paper, weighed and homogenized with 5-fold of cold 15 mM PBS/MeOH (V:V, 2:1) using mechanical method. The samples were kept with ice water when homogenizing, and further stored at −80° C. until bioanalysis.

Bioanalytical Method Development: A LC-MS/MS method was developed and used for the quantitative determination of test compound concentration in blood and brain with a calibration curve applied to determine the limits of quantification.

In Vivo Sample Analysis: Plasma and brain concentration versus time data along with Cmax, Tmax, T1/2, and AUC(0-t) was analyzed by non-compartmental approaches using the Phoenix WinNonlin 6 3 software program.

Results: As summarized in Table 3, Compound 3 was capable of brain penetration when systemically administered to male CD-1 mice via intraperitoneal injection (n=3 per group) at a dose of 30 mg/kg in a vehicle of 20% PEG400/water. Additionally, mice were monitored for up to 24 hours and no adverse effects were observed.

Compound 3 was well tolerated and is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The dose achieved in brain is within the concentration range estimated from the ex vivo cellular studies to allow efficient tau degradation.
