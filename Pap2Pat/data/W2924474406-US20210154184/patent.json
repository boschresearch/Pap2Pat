                        "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of memory and other mental functions. Worldwide, nearly 35 million people suffer from AD. The exact mechanism for AD is not fully understood, but two characteristic protein deposits, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), have been defined as causative events for AD. While senile plaques include extracellular aggregation of amyloid\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2), the NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Since tau accumulation begins before extensive neuronal loss, targeting tau protein has become a strategy for treating AD. Hence, tau is not only a drug target but also a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD by measurement of brain tau loading. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique that provides a non-invasive diagnostic method for the detection of tau aggregation. Thus, several tau radiotracers have been developed and tested in humans.",
                        "Recently, a new therapeutic strategy to reduce and/or eliminate proteins associated with certain pathological states, PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeras; e.g., see U.S. Patent Application, U.S. Ser. No. 14/792,414, filed Jul. 6, 2015), was developed by creating bifunctional compounds that recruit target proteins to E3 ubiquitin ligases, which subsequently induce proteasome-mediated degradation of the target protein. E3 ubiquitin ligases are proteins that, in combination with an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, promote the attachment of ubiquitin to a lysine on a target protein via an isopeptide bond (e.g., an amide bond that is not present on the main chain of a protein). The ubiquitination of the protein commonly results in degradation of the target protein by the proteasome.",
                        "Currently, there are no clinically approved compounds that target tau for the treatment of AD, and overall clinical failure is much higher for AD compared to other diseases. Accordingly, an ongoing need exists to identify drugs that effectively treat neurological disorders, such as AD. In particular, drugs that can take advantage of cellular machinery involved in protein homeostasis (e.g., ubiquitination and proteasome degradation) may find use as therapeutic agents."

The present disclosure describes the conjugation of tau binding moieties with an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety (e.g., lenalidomide, thalidomide) to provide compounds that can induce the ubiquitination of tau protein and promote its degradation in cells. Accordingly, the present disclosure stems from the recognition that the aggregation of tau protein, in particular hyperphosphorylated tau protein, causes certain neurological disorders (e.g., tauopathies such as AD), and that by targeting both tau protein, or any post-translationally modified form of tau, and recruiting an E3 ubiquitin ligase (e.g., Cereblon) to ubiquitinate the tau protein and mark it for proteasome degradation, a single bifunctional compound can promote the degradation of tau protein, thus providing new compounds, compostions, and methods for the treatment of neurological disease (e.g., tauopathies such as AD).

                                "The term \u201cleaving group\u201d is given its ordinary meaning in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and refers to an atom or a group capable of being displaced by a nucleophile. See, for example, Smith, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry 6th ed. (501-502). Examples of suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen (such as F, Cl, Br, or I (iodine)), alkoxycarbonyloxy, aryloxycarbonyloxy, alkanesulfonyloxy, arenesulfonyloxy, alkyl-carbonyloxy (e.g., acetoxy), arylcarbonyloxy, aryloxy, methoxy, N,O-dimethylhydroxylamino, pixyl, and haloformates. In some cases, the leaving group is a sulfonic acid ester, such as toluenesulfonate (tosylate, \u2014OTs), methanesulfonate (mesylate, \u2014OMs),p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy (brosylate, \u2014OBs), \u2014OS(\u2550O)2(CF2)3CF3 (nonaflate, \u2014ONf), or trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate, \u2014OTf). In some cases, the leaving group is a brosylate, such as p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy. In some cases, the leaving group is a nosylate, such as 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy. The leaving group may also be a phosphineoxide (e.g., formed during a Mitsunobu reaction) or an internal leaving group such as an epoxide or cyclic sulfate. Other non-limiting examples of leaving groups are water, ammonia, alcohols, ether moieties, thioether moieties, zinc halides, magnesium moieties, diazonium salts, and copper moieties. Further exemplary leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halo (e.g., chloro, bromo, iodo) and activated substituted hydroxyl groups (e.g., \u2014OC(\u2550O)SRaa, \u2014OC(\u2550O)Raa, \u2014OCO2Raa, \u2014OC(\u2550O)N(Rbb)2, \u2014OC(\u2550NRbb)Raa, \u2014OC(\u2550NRbb)ORaa, \u2014OC(\u2550NRbb)N(Rbb)2, \u2014OS(\u2550O)Raa, \u2014OSOhd 2Raa, \u2014OP(Rcc)2, \u2014OP(Rcc)3, \u2014OP(\u2550O)2Raa, \u2014OP(\u2550O)(Raa)2, \u2014OP(\u2550O)(ORcc)2, \u2014OP(\u2550O)2N(Rbb)2, and \u2014OP(\u2550O)(NRbb)2, wherein Raa, Rbb, and Rcc are as defined herein).",

                                "The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid or with organic acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, or malonic acid or by using other methods known in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.

This physical association may include hydrogen bonding. Conventional solvents include water, methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, DMSO, THF, diethyl ether, and the like. The compounds described herein may be prepared, e.g., in crystalline form, and may be solvated. Suitable solvates include pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and further include both stoichiometric solvates and non-stoichiometric solvates. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example, when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. \u201cSolvate\u201d encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Representative solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, and methanolates.",
                                "The term \u201chydrate\u201d refers to a compound that is associated with water. Typically, the number of the water molecules contained in a hydrate of a compound is in a definite ratio to the number of the compound molecules in the hydrate. Therefore, a hydrate of a compound may be represented, for example, by the general formula R.x H2O, wherein R is the compound, and x is a number greater than 0. A given compound may form more than one type of hydrate, including, e.g., monohydrates (x is 1), lower hydrates (x is a number greater than 0 and smaller than 1, e.g., hemihydrates (R.0.5 H2O)), and polyhydrates (x is a number greater than 1, e.g., dihydrates (R.2 H2O) and hexahydrates (R.6 H2O)).",

The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Tautomerizations (i.e., the reaction providing a tautomeric pair) may catalyzed by acid or base. Exemplary tautomerizations include keto-to-enol, amide-to-imide, lactam-to-lactim, enamine-to-imine, and enamine-to-(a different enamine) tautomerizations.",
                                "It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \u201cisomers\u201d. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \u201cstereoisomers\u201d.",
                                "Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed \u201cdiastereomers\u201d and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed \u201cenantiomers\u201d. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (\u2212)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a \u201cracemic mixture\u201d.",

All polymorphs have the same elemental composition. Different crystalline forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Various polymorphs of a compound can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.",

Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like. Other derivatives of the compounds described herein have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offer advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well known to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides, and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds described herein are particular prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. C1-8 alkyl, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, aryl, C7-12 substituted aryl, and C7-12 arylalkyl esters of the compounds described herein may be preferred.",

In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of a small molecule is not more than about 1,000 g/mol, not more than about 900 g/mol, not more than about 800 g/mol, not more than about 700 g/mol, not more than about 600 g/mol, not more than about 500 g/mol, not more than about 400 g/mol, not more than about 300 g/mol, not more than about 200 g/mol, or not more than about 100 g/mol. In certain embodiments, the molecular weight of a small molecule is at least about 100 g/mol, at least about 200 g/mol, at least about 300 g/mol, at least about 400 g/mol, at least about 500 g/mol, at least about 600 g/mol, at least about 700 g/mol, at least about 800 g/mol, or at least about 900 g/mol, or at least about 1,000 g/mol. Combinations of the above ranges (e.g., at least about 200 g/mol and not more than about 500 g/mol) are also possible. In certain embodiments, the small molecule is a therapeutically active agent such as a drug (e.g., a molecule approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as provided in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)). The small molecule may also be complexed with one or more metal atoms and/or metal ions. In this instance, the small molecule is also referred to as a \u201csmall organometallic molecule.\u201d Preferred small molecules are biologically active in that they produce a biological effect in animals, preferably mammals, more preferably humans. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, radionuclides and imaging agents. In certain embodiments, the small molecule is a drug. Preferably, though not necessarily, the drug is one that has already been deemed safe and effective for use in humans or animals by the appropriate governmental agency or regulatory body. For example, drugs approved for human use are listed by the FDA under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 330.5, 331 through 361, and 440 through 460, incorporated herein by reference; drugs for veterinary use are listed by the FDA under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 500 through 589, incorporated herein by reference. All listed drugs are considered acceptable for use in accordance with the present invention.",

Human CRBN contains the N-terminal part (237-amino acids from 81 to 317) of ATP-dependent Lon protease domain without the conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs, 11 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, 4 protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, 1 N-linked glycosylation site, and 2 myristoylation sites. CRBN is widely expressed in testis, spleen, prostate, liver, pancreas, placenta, kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, ovary, small intestine, peripheral blood leukocyte, colon, brain, and retina.

For each condition, 1 well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bio-Products) with 2% SDS (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini tablets), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), followed by sonication in a water sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonic Baths, Thomas Scientific) for 5 min, and centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, total protein concentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo), and SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with lOug total protein per well (pre-boiled samples). Western blots were performed with the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System (Invitrogen). All samples were resolved in 7% Tris-Acetate gels with Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies against total tau (TAUS) and phosphosrylated tau (Ser396), along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control; followed by corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Whereas the vehicle alone (DMSO) had no effect on tau, varying degrading activity was observed amongst the compounds, however with overall similar relative levels of degrading activity between tau-A152T neurons and tau-P301L neurons. Compounds were added at the doses indicated of either 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 \u03bcM. Lenalidomide (1 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM) was also evaluated as a control in some experiments since it binds CRBN but should not engage tau, as confirmed by having no effect on tau levels.",

Four-week differentiated neurons, both non-mutant (8330-8) and tau-A152T (19-5-RC6) were employed. The neurons were treated with T807 for 24 hours (at 10 \u03bcg/mL=59.4 \u03bcM). One well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate, treated or untreated) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and directly lysed in 200 \u03bcL of Sample Buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 3\u00d7 DTT, boiled for 15 min and 10 \u03bcL of each lysate was run by SDS-PAGE in a 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel, with MOPS running buffer. Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (DA9) and phosphorylated tau (Ser396, PHF1, AT8) along with GAPDH as a loading control. The results of this experiment showed that T807 had no effect on tau levels and did not degrade tau (FIG. 3). Complementarily, FIG. 5 also showed no effect of T807 on tau and phosphorylated tau, when treated concomitantly with other exemplary compounds at the same dose of 1 \u03bcM.",

In FTD neurons (A152T and P301L), tau accumulation leads to disruption of specific proteostasis pathways, which include upregulation of CHIP and VHL. For CHIP, the compounds with highest potency for tau degradation also caused a decrease in CHIP levels. This may be an indication that CRBN is a stable and useful target for degraders of tau protein in human neurons.",
                                "Example compounds 2-5 were again evaluated in tau degradation assays in non-mutant control, A152T and P301L neurons (6-week differentiated). Non-mutant neurons were employed as a negative control since derivatives of T807 should not recognize non-disease states of tau based upon how the series was identified, using selection for binding to pathological forms of tau in post-mortem brain lysates and tissue slices. In addition, T807, lenalidomide, and QC-03-075 were employed as controls along with the vehicle (DMSO). As QC-03-075 does not bind to CRBN it should act as a negative control. For each condition, 1 well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and lysed in RIPA buffer (Boston Bio-Products) with 2% SDS (Sigma), protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini tablets), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), followed by sonication in a water sonicator (Bransonic Ultrasonic Baths, Thomas Scientific) for 5 min, and centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, total protein concentration was quantified with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo), and SDS-PAGE gels were loaded with 10 \u03bcg total protein per well (pre-boiled samples). Western blots were performed with the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gel System (Invitrogen) and samples were resolved in 7% Tris-Acetate gels with Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (TAU5), phospho-tau (S396) and CRBN along with GAPDH as a loading control; followed by corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Assay results again confirmed the ability of the exemplary compounds to be effective degraders of pathological forms of tau while having little effect on levels of tau in non-mutant tau neurons (FIG. 5A-C). These results were confirmed by three biological replicates (FIG. 5C).",
                                "Example compounds 2, 3, and 5 were evaluated to determine time and dose-dependency effect on the degradation of tau in 6-week differentiated A152T neurons (FIG. 6A-B). For each condition, one well of differentiated neuronal cells (6 well-plate, treated or untreated) was washed and collected in PBS, pelleted and directly lysed in 150 \u03bcL of Sample Buffer (New England Biolabs) supplemented with 3\u00d7 DTT, boiled for 15 min and 10 \u03bcL of each lysate was run by SDS-PAGE in a Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE System (Invitrogen) with 7% Tris-Acetate gels and Tris-Acetate running buffer (Invitrogen). Blots were probed with antibodies to total tau (TAUS), and phospho-tau (S396), along with GAPDH as a loading control; followed by HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo) detection. Membranes were exposed to autoradiographic film (LabScientific) and films were scanned using an Epson Perfection V800 Photo Scanner. Protein band intensities (pixel mean intensity) were quantified using Adobe Photoshop CS5 Histogram function. Upon compound treatment, no toxicity or detachment were detected. The results confirmed the findings of the previous assays described above and showed that compounds 2 and 3 have a dose dependent effect on tau after treatment for 24 hours.",
                                "Example compounds 2, 3, and 5 were also evaluated for their ability to rescue stress vulnerability in Al 52T neurons differentiated for 8 weeks. QC-03-075 was employed as negative control. Compound 3 showed that it is effective at rescuing stress vulnerability caused by exposure of neurons to 10 \u03bcM \u03b2-amyloid (1-42) peptide for 16 h, when these neurons were pre-treated with Compound 3 for 8h prior to stress exposure (FIG. 7). The results also demonstrated that example Compounds 2, 3, and 5 had no effect on neuronal viability (FIG. 7) as for Silva et al. (Stem Cell Reports, 2016, 7(3), 325-40; doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2016.08.001) reduction of viability due to \u03b2-amyloid (1-42) exposure is dependent on tau levels."
