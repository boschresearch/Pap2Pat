                        "The textile industry is important in the U.S. and global economy. For example, the U.S. textile industry generated about $54 billion in export shipments in 2012. Cotton is the most important natural fiber in the textile industry with over 25 million tons of cotton produced from 35 million hectares from 50 countries in 2007. The textile industry is ever seeking to improve its quality control of the product.",
                        "To remain competitive in a global market, textile manufactures are always looking for new and unique ways to improve efficiency and lower costs. Historically, this has been achieved by the use of high-speed automated spinning machinery. In 1980, each spindle could transfer around 200 pounds of cotton per day. By 1995, that had increased to 600 pounds of cotton per day. Cotton thread strength increased from 26 grams/tex in 1990 to 29 grams/tex in 1995, which is about a 12% increase (Clapp et al., 2016).",
                        "Premium cotton fiber quality is necessary for high-tech spinning operations. For spinning speeds to increase, an increase in fiber strength is paramount. Methods to improve cotton fiber that spins into consistent, high-strength yarn at high speeds are sought by the industry. The limiting factor in improving cotton spinning quality control and production is cotton strength.",
                        "The use of alkaline solutions in a process called mercerization to improve cotton thread has been long recognized. Mercerization is treatment of cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton threads) with a caustic soda (NaOH) solution to improve their dying properties and thread strength and give them a lustrous appearance. Under the well-known mercerization process, cotton thread is held under specified tension for 10 minutes with an application of between 21%-23% NaOH at room temperature. During this process the chemical structure of the cotton fiber is altered whereby the fiber inter-converts from alpha- and beta-cellulose mixture to thermodynamically favorable cellulose II polymorph. The mercerization process causes the fiber cell walls to swell resulting in an increase in surface area and reflection and provides a softer feel. Optionally, an additional step of holding the thread over an open flame known as \u201csingeing\u201d or \u201cgassing the thread\u201d is often conducted.",
                        "Cotton fiber is composed of greater than 94% cellulose, 1-1.5% protein, and 1-1.5% pectin acid, mineral substances, acids, sugars, pigments and waxes (Textile Technologist, 2012). Cellulose is a particularly recalcitrant polysaccharide that is composed of hundreds to thousands of chains of \u03b2(1\u21924) linked D-glucose units held together by hydrogen bonding (Cai and Zhang, 2005; Heinze and Koschella, 2005; Li et. al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Medronho and Lindman, 2014; 2015; Nechita et al., 2010; Perez-Pimienta et al., 2013; Pinkert et al., 2009; Sarul et al., 2010; Satyanarayana et al., 2009; Sen et al., 2013; Tisserat et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004). Much research interest has been devoted to break down cellulose into carbohydrate components to serve as intermediates for biobased fuels and products. Recently, cold alkaline aqueous solvent treatments (CAT) have been employed to break down the hydrogen bonds (Cai and Zhang, 2005; Cai et al., 2003; 2008; Chen et al., 2006; 2007; Fu et al., 2014; Gan et al., 2015; Keshk, 2015; Kihlman et al., 2012; 2013; Li et. al., 2010; Li et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009; Lue et al., 2011; Mao et al, 2008; Qi et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2013; Ruan et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2002; 2009; Zhao et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2004). Cold sodium hydroxide (7% NaOH) and sodium hydroxide/urea solutions (\u02dc7% NaOH/12% urea solution) at \u221212\u00b0 C. are capable of breaking linkages between cellulose which could be subsequently regenerated to synthesize cellulose derivatives (Li et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2002. It has been noted that cold alkaline treatments (e.g., 5% NaOH solution at \u22125\u00b0 C.) of lignocellulosic fibers causes homogenous swelling but did not result in dissolvement (Li et al., 2010). Cai and Zhang (2005) employed various aqueous alkaline/urea solvents coupled with low temperature regimes to dissolve cellulose and found that LiOH H2O/urea was superior to NaOH/urea or KOH/urea. Associated with these studies was the observation that dissolved cellulose materials could regenerate into novel all-cellulose composites once the alkaline solution was removed (Cai and Zhang, 2005; Cai et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2014). Cotton linter could produce fibers via wet spinning following treatment with aqueous alkaline solutions with low temperatures (7% NaOH/12% urea at \u221210\u00b0 C.) (Cai et al., 2004; Qi et al., 2009). In addition, regenerated fibers could be prepared via wet spinning from cellulose cotton linter using a 8% NaOH/6.5% Thiourea/8% urea solution at \u22128\u00b0 C. (Zhang et al., 2009) or using a 9.5% NaOH/4.5% thiourea solution at \u221210\u00b0 C. (Ruan et al., 2004). These cotton linter studies suggested that cellulose could be completely dissolved and reassembled to produce unique cotton threads.",
                        "What is needed is a method to produce unique cotton yarn that does not completely dissolve the cotton fibers and reassemble them into a cotton yarn, but rather starts with a cotton yarn and merely partially dissolves the cotton yarn to improve the mechanical properties."

                                "Unique and strong cotton yarn were obtained by subjecting cotton yarn to cold alkaline aqueous solvents and cold temperature treatments with and without additional cotton reinforcement. Subjection of commercial threads, used to manufacture textile, to a dilute matrix of a cellulose material or gel (e.g., cotton) that was liquefied using an aqueous alkaline solvent solution (NaOH-urea, LiOH-urea and/or a LiOH/NaOH-urea mixture) under cold temperatures (\u22125\u00b0 C. to \u221215\u00b0 C.) caused the matrix cellulose to readily adhered and/or incorporate/encapsulate the cellulose into the thread. Physical testing of these cold alkaline treated threads showed that treated threads had superior mechanical properties compared to untreated threads. High speed runs of cotton threads using a motorized pull-thru system demonstrated that large scale treatment of cotton thread with cold aqueous alkaline solvent is feasible.",
                                "In the examples that follow, the following materials were used: Commercial cotton thread 30/1 OE cones were provided by Cotton Inc., Cary, N.C., USA. The cotton thread linear density was 20 tex. Commercially available alkaline hydroxides (LiOH.H2O and NaOH) and urea were of analytical grade (Aldrich-Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and used as received without further purification. Rolled cotton (Dukal Corporation, Hauppauge, N.Y.) provided cotton fibers and were used without modification.",
                                "Solvent formulations employed in these examples were comprised of LiOH H2O:Urea:water aqueous solution (weight ratios of 8.1:15:76.9) and LiOH H2O:NaOH:Urea water (weight ratios of 4.8:4.4:15:75.8). Initially, cotton threads were given various solvent treatments pre-cooled to \u221212.5\u00b0 C. for various durations (1 to 5 min) followed by soaking in a water bath for 5 min to determine their effect on cotton thread. Following solvent testing threads were soaked in water for 5 min and dried with a heat gun (model 1875 Watt ionic dryer, Revlon, New York, N.Y., USA). Unless indicated elsewhere the following procedure was employed to modification of cotton yarn. The assembly of the apparatus for mass treatment of thread using a pulling thread through solvents was constructed as shown in FIG. 1. A reel attached to a variable speed motor (1-100 rpm) (Model 7553-71, Cole Parmer Instrument Company, Chicago, Ill.) connected to a speed controller (Model 7567-70, Cole Parmer) pulled cotton thread through the solvent baths. Cotton thread was first given treatments in the following order: solvent only, solvent gel solution, solvent rinse bath, drying and then winding. Solvents were pre-cooled (\u22125 to \u221212.5\u00b0 C.) in 2 stainless steel tray vessels (150 mm width\u00d7170 mm length\u00d790 mm height; 1750 ml cap.). The solvent gel solution comprised a 2.2% solution of rolled cotton fiber immersed in the pre-cooled solvent and stirred intermittently to partially dissolve cellulose in order to obtain a solvent gel solution. The following motor speeds were administered to cotton thread: 42, 118, 186, and 286 in/min.",
                                "The mechanical properties of cotton threads were tested for tenacity at break (TB), tensile modulus (E), tensile strength (\u03c3u), and elongation at break (% El)) using a universal testing machine (Instron Model 1122, Instron Corporation, Norwood, Mass.). Cotton threads were evaluated using ASTM D2256-80 method. The gauge length was 101.6 mm and the tensile speed was 12.5 mm per min. Thirty to fifty specimens of each formulation were tested. The average values and standard errors were reported. Comparisons of the mechanical properties of the treated threads with commercial non-treated thread were conducted through a normalization processes. The untreated and treated thread were examined using a Wild Heerbrugg M5 Stereo dissecting microscope (Leica Microsystems GMbH, Wetzlar, Germany) to evaluate the effect of the cold aqueous alkaline treatments on their morphologies.",
                                "As shown in Table 1 (below), solvent soaking of cotton yarn altered of the mechanical properties. For example, soaking the cotton yarn for 5 min in a solvent solution changed the \u03b1u, E, % EL, and TB values compared to untreated thread by +24%, \u22127%, \u221217%, and +28%. The strength properties of the thread were improved while the stiffness and elongation properties declined (Table 1). Tensile strength and Tenacity at Break properties are considered the more important mechanical properties associated with cotton thread in order to obtain an improved thread that would result in improved textiles. Therefore, it is apparent that a simple cold aqueous alkaline treatment did improve cotton thread. In further studies, soaking thread in solvent/gel solution only for 1 to 5 min also had effects on the mechanical properties (Table 1). For example, soaking thread for 5 min in a solvent solution changed the \u03c3u, E, % EL, and TB values compared to untreated thread by +39%, +9%, \u221220%, and +28%. Likeness, in tests were thread was soaked in solvent 1 min followed by a solvent/gel treatment of 1, 3 or 5 min resulted in similar tensile strength improvements (Table 1). Optical examination of the thread treated with solvent/gel compared to the untreated thread clearly revealed a morphological change in the thread. The untreated thread exhibited the characteristic weave pattern and stray fibers while the treated thread did not. This indicates the cold alkaline treatment causes a fusion of the thread.",
                                "Tests were conducted using the cotton thread pull-thru system shown in FIG. 1. In this system, cotton thread was only given a few seconds of cold aqueous alkaline solvent (about 5 to 10 seconds) and solvent/gel (about 5 to 10 seconds) treatments. A variety of speeds were administered to thread to determine if pseudo-commercial treatment system was feasible. The mechanical properties of the resultant treated cotton threads obtained in these tests are presented in FIG. 4. All threads regardless of the speed run showed improvement in their \u03c3u, E, and F values while the % EL values decreased. For example, treated cotton threads obtained via this system run at 118 in/min showed changes in the \u03c3u, E, % EL, and TB values when compared to untreated thread by +35%, +50%, \u221238%, and +26%. These results suggest that even relatively brief soaking (about 5 to 10 seconds) of cotton threads in cold solvent in sufficient to improve their strength values. The strength improvement of treated threads compared to untreated thread merit their fabrication into textiles for further examination.",
                                "FIG. 5 graphically compares the mechanical properties of various treated threads run at various speeds with untreated control threads normalizing the treated threads to control thread materials. For example, the \u03c3u, E, % ELO, and TB values of the CATs run at 118 in/min were +135, +1354, +56, and +217% of that of untreated control thread, respectively."
