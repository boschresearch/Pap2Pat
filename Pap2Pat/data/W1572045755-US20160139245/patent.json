Tracks are constructed based on source location maps (SLMs) that reveal the locations of the sources over a grid of tentative source locations. The proposed estimator for the SLMs performs coherent processing of broadband acoustic measurements, capitalizes on the sparse structure of the SLMs, and uses the prior SLM estimate as a means to capture temporal information about the locations of the sources.",

An iterative solver based on the proximal gradient (PG) method may be used to construct the SLMs.",
                        "Localization and tracking of acoustic sources, such as in the underwater environment, is an important task for applications such as environmental monitoring and surveillance. Passive sonar enables monitoring and surveillance systems to operate without radiating sound into the water; hence, it is often employed in applications where concealment and low environmental impact are desired.",
                        "Underwater source localization via passive sonar is, nevertheless, difficult due to the complex interactions that sound undertakes as it propagates underwater. In shallow-water propagation environments, multi-path propagation leads to constructive and destructive acoustic interactions at the hydrophones that further exacerbate the localization problem. However, it is the same multi-path propagation that creates enough diversity in the set of received acoustic signals at the hydrophone array to enable localization in range, depth, and azimuth.",
                        "Acoustic data collected over time can be used for sketching source tracks by, for example, plotting source-location estimates over time. Tracking capitalizes on the temporal structure inherent to source tracks, which are always constrained by the kinematic features of the source, to improve source-location estimates. However, using classical tracking methods, such as Kalman filtering, to develop a passive acoustic tracker poses significant computational challenges.",
                        "Matched-field processing (MFP) refers to classical underwater source-localization techniques that rely on an acoustic model for characterizing the acoustic propagation in the environment. It uses the adopted model to predict acoustic pressures, also known as replicas, at the hydrophones for sources located on a grid of tentative source locations. Then, it \u201cmatches\u201d the replicas to the acoustic measurements gathered by the array in order to obtain acoustic-power estimates at all grid locations. The resulting power estimates are subsumed within the so-called ambiguity surface (or ambiguity volume if the sources' azimuths are also unknown). Source localization, thus, becomes a peak-picking problem where source-location estimates are mapped to grid points having high acoustic-power estimates. Despite the merits of MFP, the quality of its location estimates continues to be challenged by the presence of multiple sources and mismatch between the true propagation environment and the acoustic model used. These challenges can cause artifacts on the ambiguity surfaces that conceal the true source locations.",
                        "Tracking of underwater acoustic sources using passive sonar has traditionally been relegated to a post-processing task under the name of matched-field tracking (MFT). MFT algorithms construct a sequence of ambiguity surfaces to enable source localization at each point of the acoustic sources' trajectories.",
                        "Tracks are obtained by knitting peaks of consecutive ambiguity surfaces together. A directed graph constructed by connecting the largest peaks on neighboring ambiguity surfaces is used to construct the family of allowed tracks. The number of tracks grows combinatorially with the number of peaks used, quickly rendering this approach as computationally intractable.",
                        "Assumptions on the kinematics of the acoustic sources, e.g., maximum source velocity, constant source-speed and constant depth-trajectories, are used to reduce the number of tracks to be considered. The surviving tracks are scored based on their average acoustic-power estimates. When tracking a single source, the track with the largest score is chosen to be the true trajectory. This approach has been extended to enable coherent processing of broadband data. Weighted approaches for scoring the tracks obtained from the graph have also been proposed. A limitation common to all these approaches is that they do not use prior information when generating the ambiguity surfaces. Thus, these approaches are not well suited to process data in real time since they are required to construct a batch of ambiguity surfaces for generating tracks.",
                        "More recently, Bayesian approaches for joint tracking and parameter inversion in the context of underwater source localization have been proposed. Due to the nonlinear relationship between source locations and replicas, they use computationally-taxing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating posterior probability distributions and are, thus, prohibited in the context of real-time underwater tracking.",
                        "Sparsity-driven Kalman-filter approaches can be used for tracking acoustic sources over a grid. These approaches use the entire localization grid postulated in MFP to define their state variable. They presume that only those grid entries corresponding to the locations of the sources take non-zero values. Hence, the state variable has a sparse structure. Direct application of these methods for underwater source localization is impractical due to the high dimensionality of the grid, and hence that of the state variable. Bayesian methods for tracking a sparse signal that build on the relevance vector machine have also been proposed. However, their associated computational cost is also high due to the size of their state-space variable and their need to maintain a covariance-matrix estimate for it.",
                        "The embodiments discussed herein relate to a sparsity-driven framework for broadband source localization via passive sonar. Per time instant, SLMs, one per frequency, are constructed. Only those points on the map that correspond to source locations take nonzero values. All other points in the SLMs are set to zero. Motivated by the fact that the source locations are presumed to be independent of frequency, coherence across SLMs is enforced to guarantee that their support coincides. SLMs can be combined to construct a broadband SLM. Different from previous approaches to construct SLMs, the disclosed approach considers a regularizer that forces the SLM estimator to use both the previous SLM obtained and the new measurement available. An iterative solver based on PG may be used for constructing the SLMs.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of the operational concept of a system 10 in accordance with the Sparsity-Driven Passive Tracking of Acoustic Sources. System 10 includes K acoustic sources 20, 30, and 40, each radiating sound underwater. Although the acoustic sources are presumed to be mobile, thus justifying the dependence of their locations {rk (\u03c4)}k=1K, on the time \u03c4\u2208, no assumptions about their kinematics are made. Each rk(\u03c4)\u2208 d is given in cylindrical coordinates comprising the source's range, depth (with respect to the sea surface), and azimuth, with d\u2208{1,2,3}.",
                        "An acoustic sensor array 50 detects acoustic signals 22, 32, and 42 from sources 20, 30, and 40, respectively. As an example, an acoustic sensor array 50 is an array of N hydrophones with known and arbitrary geometry, where N>0. Array 50 is used to collect a time series of acoustic pressure vectors {y(\u03c4) \u2208N:\u03c4\u2208} with entries [y(\u03c4)]n \u2208 denoting the acoustic pressure measured by the n-th hydrophone in the array at time \u03c4. Note that although the framework is agnostic to the specific geometry of the array, its geometry affects the definition of source location. For instance, data gathered with an array that features horizontal aperture but no vertical aperture primarily provides information about the sources' azimuth only (d=1), although source range and depth can be determined depending on the closeness of the source to the end fire direction, the length of the array, and the bandwidth considered. On the other hand, data collected on a vertical array with no horizontal aperture provide information on the source range and depth only (d=2), unless the bathymetry is not flat. Data gathered with an array featuring vertical and horizontal aperture provides information about the sources' range, depth, and azimuth (d=3).",

These hydrophones were 11.25 m apart, having a total aperture of 90 m with the bottom element 6 m above the seafloor (water depth was 198 m).",
                        "A grid with G=20,000 locations spanning radial distances 0-10 km and depths 0-198 m was used, as shown by the top portion of the diagram 1120 ending at a depth of 198 m at line 1130. Depths between 198 m-228 m are represented by portion 1140, depths between 228 m-1028 m are represented by portion 1150, and depths below 1028 m are represented by portion 1160. The grid's radial and vertical spacing were 50 m and 2 m, respectively. All replicas were computed with the KRAKEN normal-mode propagation model using the environmental model as shown in FIG. 12.",
                        "Sample parameter values used in the model are: \u03bd1=1; 520 m/s, \u03bd2=1; 498 m/s, \u03bd3=1; 490 m/s, \u03bd4=1; 490 m/s, \u03bd5=1; 572 m/s, \u03bd6=1; 593 m/s, \u03bd7=1; 881 m/s, \u03bd8=3; 246 m/s, \u03bd9=5; 200 m/s, \u03b1b=0.2 dB/m/kHz, \u03b1b=0.06 dB/m/kHz, \u03b1b=0.02 dB/m/kHz, \u03c1b=1.76 g/cm3, \u03c1b=2.06 g/cm3, and \u03c1b=2.66 g/cm3.",

Note that the model used reflects the initial portion of the bathymetry (up to time 60 min). After time 60 min., there is increasing mismatch between the model used and the true propagation environment whose effect will be seen in the final portions of the tracks to be described next. An embodiment of the methods disclosed herein can alleviate this mismatch by dynamically updating the acoustic propagation model used according to the appropriate bathymetric data along the direction on which the source is located. This embodiment will use source location estimates (Eq. 3) to dynamically modify the model-based predictor based on the current source locations.",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 14 and 16, FIG. 14 shows a diagram 1300 illustrating depth tracks obtained for the source using matched-field tracking and FIG. 16 shows a diagram 1500 illustrating range tracks obtained for the source using matched-field tracking. MFT was used as a baseline for comparison. Despite its high computational complexity, MFT yields accurate track estimates for the single source case. Ambiguity surfaces obtained via Bartlett MFP, were used to construct partial linear trajectories, also known as tracklets. A total of 8 ambiguity surfaces were used to construct each tracklet. Each ambiguity surface accounts for 13.65 seconds of recorded data, and thus each tracklet corresponds to 109 seconds of recorded data. Note that there is a 50% overlap between consecutive tracklets.",
                        "Per time t, the ranges and depths of all peaks are plotted in diagram 1400 shown in FIG. 15 and diagram 1600 shown in FIG. 17. In these particular tests, the trajectory was broken into three different intervals for which different (\u03bb, \u03bc) pairs were chosen. Although the tracks obtained give a coarse approximation to those followed by the source, it was expected that by dynamically adjusting the selection of, e.g., \u03bc, the gaps in the tracks could be removed. Note that these gaps appear because the choice of \u03bc at those particular time instances was too high. Note also that both MFT and the proposed method fail to track the source after t=65 min. due to the severe mismatch between the environment and the model used to generate the replicas.",

As shown, reference 1710 represents the estimated source location, which in this case matches the true source location, while reference 1720 representing an artifact, i.e., non-zero entry in the SLM that does not correspond to a source location. The color bar on the right illustrates the intensity of each point on the map in a decibel (dB) scale. Note that the magnitude of the artifact is more than 10 dB below the magnitude of the point associated to the true source location.",

In practice, only a few iterations of either algorithm were needed to correctly identify the support of the SLMs (up to 40 iterations in this case). The dashed line 1830 illustrates the iteration value at which both algorithms were stopped, and the cost function value achieved by the PG and APG algorithms.",
                        "In order to simulate the presence of two sources using the SWellEX-3 dataset, data corresponding to the portions of the trajectory illustrated in FIG. 13 between 0-25 mins. and 40-65 mins. (first and second colored panels from left to right) were combined after being rescaled to compensate for the signal-to-noise ratio difference between the two portions of the trajectory. In this case, the computational complexity of MFT, and correspondingly its execution time, increased dramatically since the algorithm connected all combinations of pairs of peaks across ambiguity surfaces. MFT was not able to distinguish the two sources possibly due to the width of the peaks on the ambiguity surfaces.",

Similarly to the one source case, \u03bc was adapted via grid search so as to obtain approximately 15 non-zero entries per SLM. The top portion of diagram 1900 in FIG. 20 illustrates the number of nonzero entries S0 obtained per SLM. The bottom portion of diagram 1900 in FIG. 20 illustrates the estimated trajectories for the two sources, which as expected match portions of the one source trajectory shown in FIG. 13.",

Similarly to the one-source case, different (\u03bb, \u03bc) pairs were chosen for different intervals of the trajectory. Although the trajectories of the two sources can be observed in range, it is difficult to separate the two sources in depth. As in the one source case, dynamic adjustment of the parameters is expected to help improve on the quality of the tracks obtained.",

Another possible extension involves using spatially distributed arrays for localization as a way to exploit spatial diversity to counteract multipath affects in the localization performance and to reduce the presence of surveillance gaps.",
