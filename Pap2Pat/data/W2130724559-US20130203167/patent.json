                        "Eukaryotes have evolved a complex system to regulate access to genomic information by packaging DNA into chromatin. Chromatin can adopt various levels of organization that regulate essential cellular activities such as transcription, DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The fundamental repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome in which base pairs of genomic DNA is wrapped around a disc-shaped octamer of histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Nucleosome positioning on DNA is fundamentally involved in controlling gene access and is regulated in part by a diverse array of enzymes that introduce covalent post-translation modifications on histone proteins. An extensive array of histone modifications have been characterized, including lysine methylation. The large number of potential histone modification patterns provide cells with an enormous combinatorial potential for the precise regulation of gene function.",
                        "The combinatorial complexity of histone modifications is further increased by histone lysine residues that can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, each of which are correlated with distinct functional outcomes. One such lysine residue that is involved in gene regulation is the fourth lysine residue (K4) on the histone 3 (H3) protein (H3K4). Several enzymes that regulate H3K4 methylation have been identified, all possessing the evolutionarily conserved SET domain, which is required for lysine methylation. Members of the SET1 family of proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes that regulate mono-, di- and trimethylation. The most studied human SET1 family member is the mixed lineage leukemia protein-1 (MLL1), which is required for the regulation of hox genes in hematopoiesis and development. Others member of the human SET1 family include MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, SET1a and SET1b.",
                        "Recently, it has been shown that the minimal complex required for di- and trimethylation of H3K4 includes MLL1, WDR5, RbBP5 and Ash2L, which together form the MLL1 core complex. The protein WDR5 has been shown to be critical for these interactions, as it bridges the catalytic SET domain of SET1 family proteins and the regulatory components of RbBP5 and Ash2L.",
                        "Overproduction of the MLL1 core complex leads to excessive di- and trimethylation of H3K4 which disrupts gene regulation. This, in turn, alters hematopoiesis and normal development and has been linked to certain types of leukemia, solid tumors, and psychotropic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.",
                        "Therefore, a method for inhibiting the formation of SET1 family core complexes is desired. It is also desired to inhibit the H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) activity of SET1 family core complexes by inhibiting the formation of such complex."

The C-terminus of MLL1 is believed to interact with WDR5 somewhere over a domain encompassing residue numbers 3301-3969, a region which includes the N-SET region and the evolutionarily conserved SET domain. Prior to Applicants' discovery, the WDR5 binding site within this domain was unknown. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, applicants believe that the WDR5 protein binds to MLL1 in the semi-conserved N-SET region surrounding a strictly conserved arginine residue at R3765 in MLL1. Applicants refer to this motif as the WDR5 interaction motif, or \u201cWin\u201d motif. See FIG. 1. This motif has been found to be semi-conserved across multiple human SET1 family members. Examples of SET1 proteins include MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, SETd1a and SETd1b. See FIG. 2 and SEQ ID NOS. 1-6.

Applicants have found that there is a corresponding binding site on WDR5 configured to bind to the Win motif found in the N-SET region of SET1 proteins. Unexpectedly, the binding site on WDR5 is the same site that was previously shown to bind to histone H3. The pre-existing model, shown in FIG. 3A, predicts that it should not be possible to inhibit the formation of the SET1 family core complex by blocking this binding site on WDR5. However, applicants have unexpectedly discovered that this pre-existing model is not correct. Without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, applicants suggest the new model shown in FIG. 3B provides a useful construct to understand their observations. In this new model, the arginine-containing Win motif in the SET1 protein binds to a corresponding region on WDR5. Applicants have discovered that blocking this WDR5 binding site with a competitive inhibitor disrupts the binding of a SET1 family protein to WDR5, thus inhibiting the formation of the SET1 family core complex. For example, the peptide may inhibit the binding of MLL1 to WDR5, thus inhibiting the formation of the MLL1 core complex. Since the formation of the SET1 family core complex is inhibited, the corresponding biological activity\u2014dimethylation\u2014is likewise suppressed.",

Ruthenberg, Nat. Struct. Mole. Biol. 13, 704-712 (2006). This presents a paradox\u2014how does WDR5 simultaneously interact with SET1 proteins and histone H3 if they both bind to the same site on WDR5? Although this presents an interesting dilemma for scientists, such an intellectual challenge does not touch on one's ability to inhibit the formation of SET1 family core complexes in accordance with the present teachings."

                                "Evidence that supports the new model has been gathered by various methods. Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the following experimental observations may prove useful in designing SET1 family core complex inhibitors that fall under the scope of this invention.",
                                "To demonstrate that the binding site on WDR5 had been properly identified WDR5 was co-crystallized with a Win peptide consisting of amino acid residues 3762-3773 of MLL1 (GSARAEVHLRKS, SEQ ID NO. 24). The x-ray structure of the complex was determined at 1.72-\u212b resolution. The overall structure of WDR5 is highly similar to that of previously reported structures of WDR5 bound to histone H3. Like previously reported structures of WDR5, the present structure is formed by seven WD40 repeats or \u03b2-propeller blades that are organized around a central cavity. A water-filled tunnel connects the two openings of the cavity at the top and bottom of the structure with the top opening having a smaller diameter. Previous structures of WDR5 bound to H3 histones show that the N terminus of histone H3 forms a partial 310-helix when bound to the smaller opening at the top of WDR5, which is anchored by the insertion of H3R2 into the central tunnel. In the present structure, the initial difference electron density map clearly identifies the location of the Win peptide SEQ ID NO. 24 which, consistent with our prediction, is located in the same position as suggested previously for histone H3 binding. Nine residues from the N terminus could be modeled into the density, with the last three residues of the C terminus being disordered. Consistent with the tight binding observed in ITC experiments, the electron density from simulated annealing F0-Fc omit maps covers most of the modeled peptides, even when contoured at 3\u03c3. Additional information concerning this crystal structure is available in J. Bio. Chem.; v. 283, no. 47, pp. 32158-32161, Nov. 21, 2008.",
                                "The N terminus of the Win peptide SEQ ID NO. 24, like histone H3 bound to WDR5, forms a 310-helix that fits snuggly into the outer opening of the central cavity, like a cork in a bottle. Conserved SET1 residues GSARAE (SEQ ID NO. 25) all participate in the formation of the 310-helix, which is stabilized by intramolecular i\u2192i+3 main-chain hydrogen bonds between Ser-2 and Ala-5 and between Ala-3 and Glu-6. This configuration is further stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carboxylate side chain of Glu-6 and the amide nitrogen of Gly-1. This intramolecular hydrogen bond gives the sequence a cyclical conformation that allows the 310-helix to fit precisely into the outer opening of the central cavity. Point mutation studies, discussed below, provide guidance concerning acceptable variations of this peptide sequence.",
                                "An extensive network of direct and water-mediated intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions stabilizes the binding of the 310-helix to the opening of the central cavity. In previous structures of WDR5 bound to histone H3, Asp-107 of WDR5 forms a salt bridge with the N terminus of histone H3 and coordinates a network of water molecules that fill part of the central cavity. In the present structure, these water molecules are displaced by Gly-1 and Ser-2 of the Win peptide SEQ ID NO. 7, which participate in multiple hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions with Ala-47, Ala-65, Gly-89, Ile-90, and Asp-107. It is likely that these interactions account, in part, for the high affinity of WDR5 for the Win peptide. Indeed, the high quality of density at the N-terminal end of the peptide suggests that additional residues at the N terminus could show additional interactions. However, ITC binding experiments with a peptide containing six additional residues on the N terminus shows identical affinity with that of the shorter peptide used for crystallization, suggesting that the peptide used in this investigation includes many of the important interactions. It should therefore be understood that peptides such as SEQ ID NO. 24 and SEQ ID NO.25 may have additional residues incorporated on one or both termini so long as such residues do not impact the peptide's ability to inhibit the formation of the SET1 family core complex.",
                                "Ala-3 and Arg-4 of the Win peptide (SEQ ID NO. 24) occupy similar positions as Ala-1 and Arg-2 of the H3 histone in the previously reported H3-WDR5 complexes. The side chain of Arg-4 of the Win peptide inserts into the central tunnel of WDR5 and is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bond, \u03c0-\u03c0 and cation-\u03c0, and hydrophobic interactions with WDR5 residues: Ser-91, Phe-133, Ser-175, Ser-218, Cys-261, Phe-263, and Ile-305. As noted for Arg-2 of histone H3, it is likely that the sum of these interactions accounts for the majority of the binding energy between the Win peptide and WDR5, which explains why mutation of Arg-3765 in MLL1 is sufficient to abolish the assembly and dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro. This suggests a reason for the conservation of Arg-3765 in MLL1 orthologs and other SET1 family members. In addition, the guanidinium moiety of Arg-4 is sandwiched between the conserved aromatic side chains of Phe-133 and Phe-263 of WDR5, which are important for the interaction. This probably explains why the replacement of Phe-133 of MLL1 with alanine significantly diminishes the interaction between MLL1 and the WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L sub-complex in vitro and in vivo.",
                                "Amino acids on the C-terminal side of Arg-4 in SEQ ID NO. 24 also participate in a number of intermolecular interactions with WDR5. Ala-5 of SEQ ID NO. 24 interacts with Ala-47 and Tyr-260 of WDR5. The aromatic ring of Tyr-260 lines the outer edge of the central cavity and makes van der Waals contacts with Ala-5, Glu-6, and Val-7 of the Win peptide. Glu-6 of the Win peptide occupies a similar position as Lys-4 of the histone H3 in previous structures with WDR5. However, in contrast to previous structures in which the side chain of H3K4 was poorly ordered, the side chain of Glu-6 is well ordered in the present structure. This is due to direct and water-mediated intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving the side chain carboxylate of Glu-6 and the main chain amides of Gly-1 and Val-7. This may explain the high sequence conservation of Glu-6 in SET1 family members. In addition, the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-6 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side-chain of Tyr-191.",
                                "The last two residues of the Win peptide SEQ ID NO. 24 that could be modeled into the density include His-8 and Leu-9, the latter of which was less ordered. The main chain of His-8 participates in water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Lys-259, whereas the side chain of His-8 forms hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and T-stacking interactions with WDR5 residues: Phe-149, Asp-172, Pro-173, and Tyr-191. This results in the imidazole of His-8 being well ordered, even when contoured at 3-\u03c3. Leu-9 is less ordered than previous residues and does not appear to make any interactions with WDR5. It is likely that these newly observed interactions account in part for the greater affinity of the Win peptide when compared with previously published values for histone H3 binding to free WDR5. ITC measurements show that the Win peptide binds to WDR5 with an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of 1.7\u00b10.1 \u03bcM, which is between 3- and 45-fold lower than that previously reported for the binding of dimethylated histone H3K4 peptides to WDR5 using a similar technique. However, the affinity observed in ITC experiments does not appear to completely recapitulate the full interaction surface between MLL1 and WDR5, which interact with a Kd of \u02dc0.12 \u03bcM in solution when measured by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation. Nevertheless, the same Win peptide specifically inhibits the dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex by dissociating the catalytic SET domain of MLL1 from the regulatory WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L subcomplex. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the recognition of the arginine residue in the N-SET region by WDR5 is crucial for the interaction between WDR5 and MLL1. This interaction is essential for the assembly and activity of the SET1 family core complex.",
                                "One polypeptide construct consisting of residues 3745-3969 of human MLL1 (henceforth MLL3745, SEQ ID NO. 26) was made. This construct includes 66 amino acid residues of the N-set region followed by the conserved SET and post-SET domains. We believed this to be the minimal MLL SET domain construct required for the assembly of the full MLL1 core complex in vitro. A second polypeptide construct consisted of residues 3811-3969 (henceforth MLL3811) and encompassed only the conserved SET and post-SET domains. Both constructs are catalytically active in methylransferase assays with histone H3 peptides compassing residues 1-20. Sedimentation velocity analyses were performed with each of the proteins individually and were fitted to a distribution of Lamm equation solutions to determine the diffusion-free sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)). The resulting data is depicted in FIG. 4A, FIG. 4B and FIG. 4C. MLL3745, MLL3811 and WDR5 showed sedimentation values of approximately 1.68, 1.31 and 2.28, respectively, corresponding to the values for the un-complexed species.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 5A, when MLL3745 was mixed with WDR5 at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio a complex is formed with an s* value of 2.87. This is within the expected range for a complex that would be formed when MLL3745 and WDR5 bind.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 5B, when MLL3811 was mixed with WDR5 at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio no complex was formed. These two results indicate that the 66 residue N-SET region of MLL1, which was not present in MLL3811, contains the sequences that are required for the interaction of WDR5 with MLL1.",
                                "A sequence alignment study was performed to identify the key sequences in the N-SET region of various human SET1 family members that are important for binding. The results are presented in FIG. 1. Although the N-SET region is less conserved that the catalytic SET region, an 8 residue sequence was successfully identified with a higher degree of conservation in the first 6 residues. To determine which of these residues are important for the interaction of WDR5 and MLL1, select residues were individually replaced. Referring to SEQ ID NO. 26 (MLL3745) the following residues were individually replaced with alanine and the resulting polypeptides were examined for their ability to bind to WDR5: S-19, R-21, E-23 (corresponding to S-3762, R-3765, E-3767 on MLL1). The results, shown in FIG. 6A-C, show that the serine and glutamine residues could successfully be replaced by alanine with only a modest effect on the binding with WDR5. However, replacement of the arginine residue showed that the polypeptide no longer bound to WDR5. No interaction was found with the MLL3745(R3765A) polypeptide even at 1:5 stoichiometric ratio.",
                                "Subsequent far-UV CD spectra suggested that the MLL3745(R3765A) polypeptide had a secondary structure that was substantially identical to that of MLL3745. Additionally, the frictional coefficients derived from sedimentation velocity experiments are essentially unchanged relative to MLL3745. These results suggest that it is the arginine residue itself that is important for binding, rather than a structural change that is induced by changing the residue.",
                                "To determine whether the peptide disclosed herein can inhibit the assembly and activity of the MLL 1 core complex in vitro, we compared sedimentation velocity profiles and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex in the presence and absence of increasing amounts of the MLL1 Win peptide. See FIG. 8. We used the arginine-containing tumor suppressor p53 (365HSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKK382, SEQ ID NO. 27) as a control. The addition of a 20-, 30-, and 60-fold stoichiometric excess of the MLL1 Win peptide (SEQ ID NO. 24) caused the 5 s* sedimentation peak of the MLL1 core complex to increasingly broaden and shift to lower sedimentation values. For example, at a 60-fold excess of the MLL 1 Win peptide, the sedimentation profile of the complex was significantly broadened with a peak at 4.6 s*, similar to that observed with complexes assembled with the F133A WDR5 protein. This is consistent with a model in which the MLL1 Win peptide competes with MLL1 for binding to the WDR5 component of the WDR5-RbBP5-Ash2L subcomplex, producing a broad c(s) peak intermediate between the 4 s* subcomplex and the 5 s* holocomplex that is not resolvable within the signal-to-noise ratio of the data.",
                                "X-ray structural studies of WDR5 bound to histone H3 peptides revealed that arginine-2 of histone H3 is critical for the interaction with WDR5. The side chain of H3R2 inserts into a central cavity of WDR5 and is stabilized by hydrogen bond, hydrophobic, and cation-\u03c0 interactions. Since the sequence surrounding Arg-3765 of MLL1 is similar to that surrounding Arg-2 of H3, we hypothesized that WDR5 interacts with MLL1 by a similar mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we constructed point mutations in WDR5 and analyzed the mutant proteins for their ability to interact with wild-type MLL3745 in sedimentation velocity experiments. It was previously reported that the S91K and F133A WDR5 mutations prevent histone H3 binding to free WDR5. Both Ser-91 and Phe-133 line the surface of the central arginine binding cavity, and the replacement of Ser-91 with lysine is expected to sterically interfere with the insertion of the arginine side chain into the cavity. Phe-133 makes extensive hydrophobic and cation-\u03c0 interactions with the guanidinium of arginine and was previously shown to be critical for the interaction of histone H3 with WDR5. We observed that both the S91K and the F133A WDR5 proteins are incapable of interacting with MLL3745 in sedimentation velocity experiments (FIGS. 7A and 7B). This occurs without significant changes in the frictional coefficient or CD spectra of either mutant protein, suggesting that the overall conformation of the S91K and F133A mutant proteins is similar to that of wild-type WDR5. These results suggest that the central arginine binding cavity of WDR5 is important for the interaction with SET1 proteins.",
                                "Consistent with these observations, we have seen a loss of H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex when Arg-3765 of the MLL1 component is replaced by an alanine. See FIG. 9. Instead of dimethylation activity, only monomethylation activity is seen, which is the normal activity of MLL1 when it is not part of a core complex. Sedimentation analysis of the MLL1(R3765A) variant, when combined with WDR5, RbBP5 and Ash2L, showed the complex was not formed. The MLL1 Win motif peptide inhibits the H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. FIGS. 9a-e, show data for the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of enzymatic activity catalyzed by the wild-type MLL1 core complex in the absence (9a) or presence (9b-d) of an excess of the peptide. FIG. 9B shows a 20-fold excess. FIG. 9C shows a 30-fold excess. FIG. 9D shows a 60-fold stoichiometric excess of MLL1 Win peptide. Mono, monomethylation; Di, dimethylation; Tri, trimethylation is illustrated in FIG. 9E. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of enzymatic assay catalyzed by wild-type MLL1 core complex in the presence of a 60-fold molar excess of the p53 peptide is shown in FIG. 9F.",

Western blots were quantified based on band intensity using image analysis software and normalized as a function of total histone H3. Tubulin was used as a loading control and its level remained constant between the two samples. The results showed a lowering of the ratio of H3K4 to H3K27 in the presence of the inhibitor peptide. Since the ratio of H3K4 to H3K27 determines gene expression levels, a lower ratio leads to downregulated gene expression in the presence of an inhibitor peptide."
