    "abstract": "Fas-mediated apoptosis has been suggested to contribute to tubular cell death after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here we investigate whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting Fas protect mice from acute renal failure after clamping of the renal artery. Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by clamping the renal vein and artery for 15 or 35 min. Mice were treated before or after ischemia with siRNA targeting Fas or a control gene, administered by hydrodynamic injection, low-volume renal vein injection, or both. Treated mice were evaluated for renal Fas protein and mRNA expression, tissue histopathology, and apoptosis by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Blood urea nitrogen and survival were monitored in mice in which the contralateral kidney had been removed. A single hydrodynamic injection of Fas siRNA reduced Fas mRNA and protein expression in the kidney 4-fold. Kidneys from mice that received Fas siRNA two days earlier had substantially less renal tubular apoptosis by TUNEL staining and less tubular atrophy and hyaline damage. Whereas 90% of mice pretreated with saline or GFP siRNA died, only 20% of Fas -siRNA-pretreated animals died. The same survival advantage was provided by a single low-volume Fas siRNA injection into the renal vein. Moreover, postischemic injection through the renal vein protected 38% of mice from death. This study confirms the importance of Fas-mediated apoptosis in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Silencing Fas by systemic or local catheterization holds therapeutic promise to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

For hydrodynamic injection, synthetic siRNAs (50 g in 1 ml of PBS) or 1 ml of PBS was rapidly injected (within 10 sec) into one of the tail side veins or the penis vein. To dilate tail veins, the tail was immersed in warm water (50-55\u00b0C), under ether narcosis for 5 \u03ee 1 sec. For renal vein injection, from a median laparotomy the left renal pedicle was visualized and the retroperitoneum was left intact to serve as tamponade after removal of the injection needle. Minimal preparation above the renal vessels was performed on the left side of the aorta to insert an occlusion clip (BH31, Aesculap, Center Valley, PA). The aorta and the vena cava were clipped, and the renal vein was punctured with a 26-gauge needle, to inject 0.1 ml of PBS containing siRNA or PBS alone. The needle was kept in place for 5 sec and than removed slowly, while applying compression to the renal vein for 30 sec with a piece of Gelaspon (Chauvin Ankerpharm, Rudolstadt, Germany) held with forceps. The Gelaspon was left in place thereafter. The aorta and vena cava clamp was removed immediately after the injection, having been maintained for a total of at most 10 sec for each injection.",

                "We first delivered synthetic siRNA duplexes (50 g, 2.0-2.5 mg\u035ekg) by a single hydrodynamic injection into the tail vein, using a Fas sequence that silenced effectively and specifically in the liver (8,12). Twenty-four hours later, Fas mRNA in the kidney was reduced by 74 \u03ee 8% as determined by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR of whole kidney homogenates (Fig. 1a).",
                "Reduction in Fas mRNA was comparable to Fas silencing in the liver after three 50-g hydrodynamic injections of the same siRNA (86% by RNase protection assay) (8).",
                "We next determined whether Fas siRNA injection could silence up-regulated Fas expression after ischemic damage. In pilot experiments in which the contralateral kidney was removed or clamped, 15 min of ischemia led to fatality in 16% (1 of 6) of mice and 30 min of ischemia killed 40-60% of mice, whereas 35-45 min of ischemia killed 80-100% of mice. The solitary fatal event after 15 min of ischemia may have been due to a cause other than acute tubular necrosis, because the typical increase in BUN after 15 min of ischemia was small and transient (see below and Fig. 2a). These survival data suggest that the strain of mice used in these experiments is more sensitive to ischemic renal injury than are some inbred laboratory strains. In subsequent experiments we clamped the renal pedicle for either 15 or 35 min. Two days after a single hydrodynamic injection of 50 g of Fas or GFP siRNA or saline, the left renal pedicle (artery and vein) was clamped for 35 min (leaving the right kidney intact), and mice were killed 1 day later for analysis of renal Fas expression and apoptosis. Fas silencing was also effective in the setting of ischemia. The ratio of Fas to GAPDH mRNA assayed by real-time PCR was 4 and 5 times lower in mice that received Fas siRNA compared with mice that received GFP siRNA (P \u03fd 0.001) or hydrodynamic injection of saline (P \u03fd 0.01), respectively (data not shown). The reduction in Fas mRNA upregulation after ischemia in mice that received Fas siRNA was similar to the mRNA reduction in the nonischemic setting (Fig. 1a). Histological sections prepared from both kidneys were stained for Fas protein expression and for TUNEL to detect apoptotic cells and were evaluated in a blinded manner for histological evidence of kidney damage (Fig. 1 b-e). In the absence of ischemia after hydrodynamic injection of GFP siRNA, 10 \u03ee 1% of tubule epithelial cells stained for Fas. In clamped kidneys from GFP-siRNA-or saline-treated control mice, almost half of the tubule epithelial cells (45 \u03ee 3% and 44 \u03ee 1%, respectively) had detectable Fas protein. However, in Fas-siRNA-treated mice, only 13 \u03ee 2% of tubule cells stained for Fas. This percentage was statistically indistinguishable from Fas staining in control mice in which the renal pedicle was not clamped (P \u03ed 0.13). The clamped kidneys from Fas-siRNAtreated mice also had significantly fewer apoptotic tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 1 d ande). Whereas 9 \u03ee 2% of renal tubule epithelial cells from Fas-siRNA-treated mice were TUNEL \u03e9 , 17 \u03ee 1% of cells from mice that received GFP siRNA (P \u03fd 0.001) and 14 \u03ee 2% of cells from saline-treated (P \u03fd 0.01) were TUNEL \u03e9 . Fas siRNA also protected the kidneys from ischemic damage, assessed by a blinded histopathology score that emphasized cortical tubular epithelial cell damage (Fig. 1 f andg). All control saline and GFP-siRNA-treated mice had extensive cortical tubular damage with massive tubular atrophy and cell loss with tubulointerstitial inflammatory cell infiltrates. Most surviving tubular epithelial cells had evidence of cytoplasmic swelling, and there was frequent nuclear chromatin condensation, indicative of apoptosis. In the medulla, tubular lumens were filled with hyaline material indicative of intense tubular cell loss in upper segments. In contrast, pretreatment with Fas siRNA prevented tubular epithelial cell loss and lessened inflammatory infiltration. The tubule histology score in the absence of ischemic insult in control siRNA-injected mice was \u03fd1 (on a scale that ranged from 0 to 3); it increased to 2.7 \u03ee 0.3 in the ischemic kidney of saline control mice and to 2.8 \u03ee 0.1 in GFP-siRNAinjected mice, but there was half as much damage (score 1.5 \u03ee 0.4) in Fas-siRNA-treated mouse kidneys (P \u03fd 0.01 vs. saline, P \u03fd 0.003 vs. GFP siRNA).",
                "We next treated mice with a single hydrodynamic injection of Fas siRNA, as above, followed by a low-volume injection (50 g in 0.1 ml) into the left renal vein 2 days later, and we induced subcritical ischemia 2 days after that by clamping the left renal pedicle for 15 min. If the right kidney was removed at the time of the renal injection, transient renal insufficiency developed in control mice (Fig. 2a). The BUN rose to 71 \u03ee 4 mg\u035edl the next day, compared with a normal value of 33 \u03ee 1 mg\u035edl without ischemia. Two days later the BUN had normalized. In mice treated with hydrodynamic and renal vein injections of Fas siRNA, the BUN remained normal (33 \u03ee 4 mg\u035edl 1 day and 36 \u03ee 6 mg\u035edl 2 days after clamping). We next looked at how effectively Fas was silenced in the setting of 15 min of subcritical ischemia. In mice sham-treated with saline injections without clamping the renal pedicle, the Fas\u035eGAPDH mRNA ratio by real-time PCR was 0.03 \u03ee 0.01, which was reduced to 0.015 \u03ee 0.01 in mice that received Fas siRNA (Fig. 2b). After subcritical ischemia, the ratio increased 10-fold to peak 1 day later at 0.30 \u03ee 0.07 and remained elevated at 0.16 \u03ee 0.07 2 days later. However, in the mice that received Fas siRNA, the Fas\u035eGAPDH mRNA ratio in the ischemic kidney hardly rose above that of the control mice not subjected to ischemia. The Fas\u035eGAPDH ratio was 0.032 \u03ee 0.01 and 0.046 \u03ee 0.003 on days 1 and 2 after clamping (P \u03fd 0.001 compared with control on day 1). Moreover, Fas protein expression, assayed by counting the numbers of Fasstaining tubule cells by immunohistochemistry, was also substantially reduced in the challenged kidney (Fig. 2 c andd). In the Fas-siRNA-treated mice, 13 \u03ee 2% of tubule cells in the ischemic kidney became Fas \u03e9 at the peak response on day 1, whereas 49 \u03ee 4% of tubule cells stained for Fas in the ischemic control mouse kidney. Fas staining in the ischemic kidney of mice that received Fas siRNA was not significantly different from Fas staining in the nonischemic right kidney of control mice that received only saline injections. When the numbers of TUNEL \u03e9 apoptotic cells in the ischemic kidney were counted 1 and 2 days after clamping, there were about half as many TUNEL \u03e9 cells in the Fas-siRNA-treated mice as in the controls (Fig. 2e, P \u03fd 0.002 day 1, P \u03fd 0.05 day 2). Renal pathology determined by hematoxylin staining was also significantly reduced in the ischemic kidney with silenced Fas expression (tubule histopathology score, 1.4 \u03ee 0.5 in Fas-siRNA-treated animals vs. 2.2 \u03ee 0.3 in control mice, P \u03fd 0.05).",
                "Because Fas expression in the kidney and tubular apoptosis and ischemic damage were suppressed, we next determined whether Fas siRNA could provide protection from critical ischemia in mice in which the left renal pedicle was clamped for 35 min and the contralateral kidney was removed. The right kidney was removed by median laparotomy 2 days before a single hydrodynamic injection of saline, GFP siRNA, or Fas siRNA. Two days later the renal pedicle of the remaining kidney was clamped for 35 min and the mice were observed (Fig. 3a). Four of five mice that received saline and all five mice that received GFP siRNA by hydrodynamic tail vein injection died of acute renal failure within 2 days. However, 8 of 10 mice injected with Fas siRNA survived (P \u03fd 0.0001 vs. GFP siRNA, P \u03fd 0.005 vs. saline). Kidney function, assessed by following BUN in surviving mice, was less perturbed in mice that received Fas siRNA than in those that received a hydrodynamic injection of saline (Fig. 3b). Whereas the peak BUN in surviving control mice was 646 \u03ee 77 mg\u035edl, it was a third of that (232 \u03ee 33 mg\u035edl, P \u03fd 0.0001) in Fas-siRNA-treated mice, compared with a normal value of 33 \u03ee 1 mg\u035edl.",
                "We also tested whether low-volume injection of siRNAs (100 l) into the left renal vein (performed at the same time the right kidney was removed), which was well tolerated in the previous experiments, could enhance or substitute for hydrodynamic injection. The survival curves of mice treated with just renal vein infusion or with both hydrodynamic and renal vein injection were indistinguishable from those of mice that received a single hydrodynamic injection (Fig. 3a). Renal vein injection provided a significant survival advantage from critical ischemiareperfusion injury (P \u03fd 0.001 vs. GFP siRNA, P \u03fd 0.01 vs. saline). Although hydrodynamic injection is unlikely to be possible in humans, catheterization of the renal vein is a feasible therapeutic option.",
                "Although in some situations, such as preoperatively, it may be possible to anticipate ischemia-reperfusion injury, in most clin-ical situations ischemic damage arises without forewarning. We therefore evaluated survival when Fas siRNA was administered after the ischemic insult. Fas siRNA was injected in 100 l into the renal vein during reperfusion 5 min after releasing the renal vessel clamp, when the kidney had recovered its red color. Postischemic renal vein injection protected three of eight mice from 35-min ischemia, whereas all eight GFP-siRNA-treated control mice and seven of eight saline-treated controls did not survive (P \u03fd 0.01 vs. GFP siRNA, P \u03ed 0.07 vs. saline). (Fig. 3c) In Fig. 3 a andc, all of the GFP-siRNA-treated mice died, whereas in each saline-treated group, one mouse survived. Although the differences between saline and GFP siRNA treatment in the experiments shown in Fig. 3 and elsewhere are not statistically significant, we cannot exclude subtle off-target effects induced by the GFP siRNA."

                "This study confirms the importance of Fas-mediated apoptosis in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, because silencing Fas protected mice from lethal acute ischemic renal failure. The tissues of other organs, such as the heart or brain, might also be protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury by silencing Fas. Protection was provided not only by hydrodynamic injection but also by a single low-volume injection into the renal vein. How hydrodynamic injection works is not well understood. It is hypothesized that parenchymal cells are transduced when they are subjected to increased hydrostatic pressure induced by a sudden increase in intravascular volume. It is unlikely that this approach can be scaled up to human therapy. However, renal vein catheterization is feasible in humans and is likely to target the part of the kidney most vulnerable to ischemic damage, the tubulointerstitium. However, this study did not directly measure which kidney cells take up siRNAs after either hydrodynamic or renal vein injection. Future studies to detect the distribution of fluorescently labeled siRNAs into different renal cells will be useful to guide the development of therapeutic strategies in the kidney. In this study we chose an injection volume that roughly corresponds to the volume of a single mouse kidney (13). These injections may have created a transient localized increase in intravascular pressure within the kidney resulting in retrograde flow with siRNA transduction of tubule cells by a similar mechanism as for hydrodynamic injection, but without the risk of right-sided heart failure. Further studies to measure local and systemic intravascular pressures are necessary.",
                "In a previous study we found that this Fas siRNA sequence specifically silenced Fas, but not other genes in the apoptotic pathway (8). However, recent in vitro studies have suggested that some duplex siRNA sequences have off-target effects and can induce an IFN response, particularly at high concentrations (14)(15)(16). Further studies are required to investigate whether these problems are of concern in vivo and for this sequence. However, preliminary in vitro studies in which cells were transfected with the Fas siRNA used in this study did not indicate any induction of IFN-inducible genes (data not shown). Our data suggest that silencing Fas expression in renal tubular epithelial cells is the mechanism for protection by Fas siRNA injection. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that indirect antiinflammatory effects of silencing Fas expression elsewhere contribute to the protective outcome.",
                "Local injection of Fas siRNAs after ischemia provided some, but less complete, protection. Survival of Fas-siRNA-treated mice was significant when compared with GFP-siRNA-treated mice or with GFP-siRNA-and saline-treated control mice considered together (P \u03fd 0.02), but not when compared with the saline-treated mice, although there was a trend toward protection. If the half-life and delivery efficiency of duplex siRNAs in vivo can be improved by chemical modification (17,18), protection might be more effective. Postischemic protection is possible because Fas is up-regulated after ischemia, allowing a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention."
