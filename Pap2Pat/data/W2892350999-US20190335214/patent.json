    "title": "SYSTEM FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE ON-DEMAND VIDEO TRANSCODING",
    "date": "2019-07-10 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Video streams, either in form of on-demand streaming or live streaming, usually have to be transcoded based on the characteristics of clients' devices. Transcoding is a computationally expensive and time-consuming operation; therefore, streaming service providers currently store numerous transcoded versions of the same video to serve different types of client devices. Due to the expense of maintaining and upgrading storage and computing infrastructures, many streaming service providers recently are becoming reliant on cloud services. However, the challenge in utilizing cloud services for video transcoding is how to deploy cloud resources in a cost-efficient manner without any major impact on the quality of video streams. To address this challenge, in this paper, the Cloud-based Video Streaming Service (CVSS) architecture is disclosed to transcode video streams in an on-demand manner. The architecture provides a platform for streaming service providers to utilize cloud resources in a cost-efficient manner and with respect to the Quality of Service (QoS) demands of video streams. In particular, the architecture includes a QoS-aware scheduling method to efficiently map video streams to cloud resources, and a cost-aware dynamic (i.e., elastic) resource provisioning policy that adapts the resource acquisition with respect to the video streaming QoS demands. Simulation results based on realistic cloud traces and with various workload conditions, demonstrate that the CVSS architecture can satisfy video streaming QoS demands and reduces the incurred cost of stream providers up to 70%.",

Each sequence is divided into multiple Group of Pictures (\u201cGOP\u201d), with the sequence header information at the front. A GOP is essentially a sequence of frames beginning with 1 (intra) frame, followed by a number of P (predicted) frames or B (be-directional predicted) frames. There are two types of GOP: open-GOP and closed-GOP. In close-GOP, there is no inter-relation among GOPs, hence, can be transcoded independently. In contrast, there is an inter-dependency between GOPs in open-GOP. Each frame of the GOP contains several slices that consist of a number of microblocks (MB) which is the basic operation unit for video encoding and decoding.",

Video contents are initially captured with a particular format, spatial resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. Then the video is uploaded to streaming servers. Streaming servers usually adjust the original video based on the client's network bandwidth, device resolution, frame rate, and video codec. All these conversions and adjustments are generally referred to as video transcoding. I. Ahmad, X. Wei, Y. Sun, and Y. Q.

Video stream clients have unique QoS demands. In particular, they need to receive video streams without any delay. Such delay may occur either during streaming, due to an incomplete transcoding task by its presentation time (\u201cmissing presentation deadline\u201d), or it may occur at the beginning of a video stream (\u201cstartup delay\u201d). Previous studies confirm that streaming clients mostly do not watch videos to the end. See X. Cheng, J. Liu, and C.

However, they rank the quality of a stream provider based on the video's startup delay. Therefore, to maximize clients' satisfaction, we consider video streaming QoS demand as: minimizing the startup delay without missing the presentation deadline.",
                        "Streaming service provider's goal is to spend the minimum for cloud resources, while meets the QoS requirements of video streams. Satisfying this goal becomes further complicated when we consider the variations exist in the demand rate of video streams. Thus, to minimize the cost of utilizing cloud resources, our system should adapt its service rate (i.e., transcoding rate) based on the clients' demand rate and with respect to the video streams' QoS requirements. As such, there is a need in the market for: (1) improvement of clients' QoS satisfaction by minimizing video streams startup delay and presentation deadline miss rate; and (2) creation of a dynamic cloud resource provisioning policy to minimize streaming service providers' incurred cost while the clients' QoS demands are respected. To meet these needs, herein disclosed is a Cloud-based Video Streaming Service architecture."

The goal of this work is to decrease the deadline miss rate and startup delay of video streams and minimize the incurred cost of cloud resources. Experiment results show that the proposed scheduling method provides low QoS violation rate, specifically when combined with SDF queuing policy.

In particular, when the video demand rate is not high, it reduces the costs up to 70% in compare with the static policies.

The system shows the sequence of actions taken place when clients request videos from a streaming service provider. The disclosed system includes six main components, namely: video splitter, task (i.e., GOP) scheduler, transcoding virtual machines (VM), elasticity manager, video merger, and caching policy. The cooperation of these components leads to cost-efficient and QoS-aware on-demand video transcoding on the cloud.",
                        "In the video splitter component, each video stream is split into several GOPs that can be transcoded independently. Others have considered several GOPs to construct a transcoding segment. In this case, each transcoding task has to deal with several GOPs. In the preferred embodiment, segments are transcoded with one GOP for more efficient scheduling. As such, in the preferred embodiment, each GOP is treated as a task with an individual deadline. The deadline of a GOP is the presentation time of the first frame in that particular GOP. For video on-demand streaming (e.g., Netflix and YouTube), if a GOP misses its deadline, it still has to complete its transcoding. This disclosure considers the close-GOP type where processing of each GOP can be carried out independently.",

The scheduler's goal is to satisfy the QoS demands of clients in terms of minimum startup delay and minimum deadline miss rate of video streams. The GOPs of different video streams are interleaved in the scheduling queue. In addition, the scheduler has no assumption or prior knowledge about the arrival pattern of the GOPs to the system.",

Each VM has a local queue where the required data for GOPs are preloaded before execution. The scheduler maps GOPs to VMs until the local queue gets full. As all allocated VMs that execute transcoding tasks are homogeneous, size of their local queues is the same across all the allocated VMs. Whenever a free spot appears in the local queue of a VM, the scheduler is notified to map a GOP to the VM. We assume that the GOP tasks in the local queue are scheduled in the FCFS fashion.",
                        "The elasticity manager (EM) is responsible for monitoring the operation of transcoding VMs in the CVSS architecture, and accordingly resizes the VM cluster with the goal of meeting the clients QoS demands and minimizing the incurred cost to the stream provider. For that purpose, EM includes dynamic (i.e., elastic) resource provisioning policies that are in charge of allocating and deallocating VM(s) from the cloud provider based on the clients' demand rate. When video streams' QoS violation rate increases or the scheduling queues size increases, the EM allocates VM(s) and adds them to the VM cluster. Similarly, resource provisioning policies of EM identifies circumstances that VMs are under-utilized and removes them from the VM cluster to minimize the incurred cost to the streaming service provider. EM is executed periodically and also in an event-based fashion to verify if the allocated VMs are sufficient to meet the QoS demands or not. Once the EM updates the set of allocated VMs, it informs the scheduler about the latest configuration of the VM cluster.",
                        "The task of video merger is to place all the transcoded GOPs in the right order to create the resulting (i.e., transcoded) video stream. Video merger sends the transcoded streams back to the video repository to be accessed by clients.",

That is, there are few videos that are accessed very frequently (i.e., trending videos), and many others that are barely streamed by clients. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary transcoding of the trending videos, the CVSS architecture provides a caching policy to decide whether a transcoded video should be cached or not. However, if the video is barely requested by clients, there is no need to store (i.e., cache) the transcoded version of that. Such videos are transcoded in an on-demand manner upon clients' request.",

For scheduling, GOPs of the requested video streams are batched in a queue upon arrival. To minimize the startup delay of video streams, another queue is termed the startup queue. The first few GOPs of each new video stream are placed in the startup queue that has a higher priority in comparison to the batch queue. To avoid any execution delay, each VM is allocated a local queue where required data for GOPs are preloaded, before the GOP transcoding execution started.",

Therefore, to obtain the absolute deadline for Gij (denoted \u0394ij) the relative deadline must be added to the presentation start time of the video stream (denoted \u03c8i).

Therefore, an estimation of the transcoding execution time for each Gij (briefly called transcoding time and denoted \u03c4ij), can be obtained from the historic execution information of Gij. We note that, although we transcode the same GOP of a given video on a cluster of homogeneous VMs, there is some randomness (i.e., uncertainty) in the transcoding execution time. That is, the homogeneous VMs do not necessarily provide identical performance. This is attributed to the fact that the VMs can be potentially allocated on different (i.e., heterogeneous) physical machines on the cloud. The performance variation of a VM can also be attributed to other neighboring VMs that coexist with the VM on the same physical host in the cloud datacenter. For instance, if the neighboring VMs have a lot of memory access, then, there will be a contention to access the memory and the performance of the VM will be different with situation that there is not such neighboring VM.",

At each scheduling event, Gs can be scheduled before Gb only if it does not cause Gb to miss its deadline. For that purpose, we calculate the minimum completion time of Gs across all VMs. Then, we can calculate the minimum completion time of Gb, assuming that Gs has already been mapped to a VM, and finally check if Gb will miss its deadline or not. If not, then Gs can be scheduled before Gb.",

                        "Dynamic Resource Provisioning Policy Overview: EM in the CVSS architecture is in charge of adapting cloud resource acquisition based on the clients demand rate. For that purpose, EM includes resource provisioning policies that dynamically allocates or deallocates VMs from the cloud provider. Then, the policies notify the transcoding scheduler to consider the changes in its task mapping decisions. The goal of the provisioning policies is to minimize the incurred cost to the stream provider while respecting the video streaming QoS demands. More specifically, the stream provider can determine an upper bound threshold (denoted \u03b2) for the percentage of transcoding tasks that can miss their deadlines (termed deadline miss rate and denoted yt in a given time t). Similarly, there is a lower bound threshold (denoted \u03b1) that enables the provisioning policies to reduce the incurred cost of stream providers through terminating VM(s). Therefore, any provisioning policy has to manage VM allocation so that the deadline miss rate remains between \u03b1 and \u03b2. That is, at any given time t we should have \u03b1\u2264yt\u2264\u03b2.",
                        "Resource provisioning policies of the EM follow the \u201cscale up early and scale down slowly\u201d principle. That is, VM(s) are allocated from cloud as soon as a provisioning decision is made. However, as the stream provider has already paid for the current charging cycle of the allocated VMs, the deallocation decisions are not practiced until the end of the current charging cycle.",
                        "Periodic Resource Provisioning Policy: This resource provisioning policy occurs periodically (referred to as \u201cprovisioning events\u201d) to make allocation or deallocation decisions. At each provisioning event, the policy predicts the deadline miss rate that will occur at the next provisioning event (i.e., yt+1) based on the current states of the local queues and the batch queue.",
                        "The following Algorithm 1 provides a pseudo-code for the periodic provisioning policy.",
                        "The policy makes allocation decisions based on the current deadline miss rate (yt in step 1 of the Algorithm 1) and the predicted (i.e., estimated) deadline miss rate in the next provisioning event (yt+1 in steps 2 to 6). To predict yt+1, the policy assumes that there is no limit on the VMs' local queue sizes. Then, it obtains the expected completion time for each task waiting in the batch or startup queue based on Equation 1 and the scheduling method (see Section IV). Once the tasks completion times are calculated, the provisioning policy can determine the deadline miss rate at the next provisioning event (yt+1).",
                        "Decision making on allocating new VMs does not only depend on the predicted deadline miss rate in the next provisioning event (yt+1), but it also depends on the variation of deadline miss rate until the next event. That is, if the predicted deadline miss rate is beyond the upper bound threshold (yt+1>\u03b2) but it is less that the current deadline miss rate (i.e., yt+1\u2212yt<0), then it means that the current allocation is effective and the deadline miss rate is reducing (see step 8). Similar phenomenon can happen for deallocating VMs. Having a predicted deadline miss rate less than \u03b1 is not sufficient to deallocate VMs. In fact, if yt+1>\u03b1 but the deadline miss rate is predicted to increase (i.e., yt+1\u2212yt>0), then we should not deallocate any VM (see step 10).",
                        "The number of VM allocations by the policy depends on how far yt+1 is from \u03b2. That is, the further the predicted deadline miss rate is from \u03b2, more VMs have to be allocated (step 9). Arrival rate of transcoding tasks also impacts the deadline miss rate in the system. Therefore, the periodic resource provisioning policy considers the arrival rate (k in step 9) when decides about allocating new VMs. In the case that the predicted deadline miss rate is between the allowed thresholds (\u03b1\u2264yt\u2264\u03b2), the policy does not to take any action in terms of allocating or deallocating VMs (step 13).",
                        "Remedial Resource Provisioning Policy: The periodic dynamic provision policy introduced in the previous section predicts deadline miss rates accurately. However, in our initial experiments we noticed that obtaining estimated completion time for all tasks is a time consuming process and imposes a significant overhead at each provisioning event. Hence, it is not efficient to perform provisioning events frequently. In addition, the uncertainty exists in the execution time of each transcoding task is compounded as the length of the VM local queues increases. Thus, the accuracy of predictions on task completion times and deadline miss rates decreases. The last but not the least is the fact that we have no assumption or knowledge about the demand rate that will arrive to the system.",

However, such tasks cannot be executed if they cause a deadline miss for the tasks in the batch queue. Thus, when there is a congestion in the startup queue, the tasks deadlines in the batch queue are urgent (i.e., have fast approaching deadlines). Therefore, there is a correlation between the number of tasks waiting in the startup queue and the deadline miss rate in the near future. To avoid such deadline miss rate, our lightweight remedial policy checks the size of the startup queue (denoted Ns).

To show the impact of different workload intensities, the experiment was performed with various number of video stream requests arriving during the same time interval (horizontal axis in FIG. 5). To focus merely on the impact of the scheduling method, in this experiment, static resource provisioning policy with 10 VMs is considered. Also, Shortest Job First (SJF) is used for the queuing policy in the batch queue.",
                        "FIG. 5(a) shows that, when using QoS-aware scheduling, the average startup delay can be kept to less than 1 second. The startup delay remains almost the same as the number of video streams increases. More importantly, the reduced startup delay is obtained without a major impact on the video streams' deadline miss rate. FIG. 5(b) shows that the average deadline miss rate is almost always less than 10%. This experiment demonstrates that it is possible to transcode videos in an on-demand manner. FIG. 5(c) shows that both with and without QoS-aware scheduling, the incurred cost is almost the same. The reason is that in both methods all tasks have to be completed. Thus, the total time cloud VMs are utilized is the same. The users' QoS satisfaction can thus be improved without incurring extra cost to the stream provider.",

As the number of video requests increases, the startup delay and deadline miss rate grow significantly in SDF and FCFS, while remains low and stable with SJF. This is mainly because when there are a massive number of videos being transcoded, the batch queue is congested, and GOPs miss their deadlines. The growth of the deadline miss rate prevents the QoS-based scheduling method to be effective, thus, the startup delay increases too. However, the SJF priorities GOPs with shorter execution times, which significantly reduces congestion. Hence, SJF produces a better startup delay and lower deadline miss rate when combined with the static provisioning policy.",
                        "FIG. 6(c) shows that all three queuing policies cost almost the same. In fact, the total transcoding time of all the videos is the same and stream provider has to pay almost the same amount for any static method with a fixed number of VMs.",
                        "As shown in FIGS. 6(d) and 6(e), SDF produces the lowest deadline miss rate in the dynamic provisioning policy. This is because SDF maps the most urgent GOP tasks first. Therefore, the rest of GOPs will have enough slack time and allow the GOP tasks in the startup queue to execute without missing their own deadlines. The reason that SJF has low startup delay but higher deadline miss rate is that it priorities GOPs the GOPs with short transcoding time from middle or rear part of the video stream. This creates an opportunity for the GOPs in the startup queue, while incurs a large deadline miss rate for long GOPs with short deadlines. In the FCFS policy, GOPs in the batch queue have to wait until all GOPs arrived earlier be transcoded, this leads to a high deadline miss rate.",
                        "As demonstrated in FIG. 6(f), SDF incurs the lowest cost, especially when the video requests arrival is low and the system is not congested.

As SJF and SDF perform the best in static and dynamic provisioning policies, we just compare the results from these two policies. For static policy, we only present the results for fixed number of VMs\u2014from 5 to 10\u2014because the startup delay and deadline miss rate are very high when few VMs are allocated.",
                        "In FIG. 7(a), as the number of video requests increases, the average startup delay in all static policies grows while in the dynamic policy it produces a low and stable startup delay. When the workload is not intensive (i.e., system is lightly loaded), the dynamic policy has a little bit higher startup delay (\u2243 1 second) than the static policy. In fact, to reduce the incurred cost, the dynamic policy usually allocated fewer VMs in compare with the static one. Therefore, new GOP tasks have to wait in the queue to be transcoded. However, the static policy with a large number of VMs can process GOPs in the startup queue quickly that reduces the startup delay.",
                        "FIG. 7(b) illustrates that the dynamic resource provisioning policy leads to low and stable deadline miss rate in compare with the static one. In the static policy with few VMs, as the number of video requests increases, the deadline miss rate grows dramatically. As the dynamic provisioning policy functions based on the deadline miss rate to resize the VM cluster, it keeps the average deadline miss rate low, even when the system is congested.",
                        "With low and stable startup delay and deadline miss rate, FIG. 7(c) shows that the dynamic provisioning policy reduces up to 70% cost when the system is not congested. When the video demand rate is low, VMs are under-utilized in the static policy; however, the stream provider still has to pay for them. In the dynamic provisioning policy, the system deallocates idle VMs when the deadline miss rate is below the lower bound threshold (\u03b1), which reduces the incurred cost significantly. As the video demands rate becomes intensive, more VMs are created; therefore, the cost incurred by the dynamic policy approaches the static one.",

As illustrated in FIG. 8, when the system is not congested, the difference between the two scenarios is negligible. This is because when few videos arrive during the next provisioning event, it does not significantly impact the accuracy of deadline miss rate estimation. In this case, the VMs allocated by periodic resource provisioning policy are capable to keep streaming QoS violation low and stable.",

Under this circumstance, as depicted in FIG. 8, relying only on the periodic provisioning policy leads to a high QoS violation rate. Nonetheless, when the remedial resource provisioning policy is utilized and the system is congested, we notice a remarkable difference in the QoS violation rate. It is shown in the last subfigure of FIG. 8 that injecting remedial resource provisioning policy comes without incurring any extra cost to the stream provider.",

The challenge in dynamic provisioning policy is how to handle the trade-off between the cost and the QoS violation, with different values of the upper bound threshold (i.e., \u03b2).

In the contrary, higher \u03b2 value reduces the expense at the cost of higher QoS violation. However, at some points, we can find some \u03b2 values (e.g., 0.15 to 0.3) that produce good video streams QoS with reasonably low cost. We noticed that the relationship between the cost and QoS violation in our system is not linear.
