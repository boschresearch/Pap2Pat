# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- introduce metabolic syndrome
- discuss hyperlipidemia
- describe PCSK9 inhibitors
- explain PAI-1 role
- summarize PAI-1 correlations

## SUMMARY

- summarize PAI-1 link to metabolic syndrome
- describe PAI-1 inhibition effect
- outline treatment methods
- list potential metabolic disorders

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe PAI-1 as critical mechanistic factor in metabolic syndrome
- associate PAI-1 with hyperlipidemia and PCSK9
- demonstrate inhibition of PAI-1 with TM5614
- show decrease in PCSK9 at transcriptional and protein level
- regulate transcription of lipid biosynthesis factors
- lead to reduction in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C
- recognize PAI-1 as contributor to metabolic syndrome
- describe treatment involving PAI-1 inhibitor
- decrease total plasma cholesterol, LDL, or HDL concentration
- associate inhibition of PCSK9 with decrease in serum cholesterol
- increase expression of FGF21
- reduce cholesterol synthesis and hypercholesterolemia
- orally administer TM5614 to reduce hepatic PCSK9 mRNA
- reduce plasma PCSK9 levels
- reduce plasma HDL-C and LDL-C
- downregulate genes involved in lipid synthesis and metabolism
- describe post-translational effects on PCSK9
- regulate ratio of glycosylated and non-glycosylated PCSK9
- associate genetic deficiency of PAI-1 with reduction of plasma PCSK9 levels
- correlate plasma levels of PAI-1 and PCSK9
- prevent hepatic steatosis and reduce serum cholesterol levels
- provide method of treating metabolic disorder
- administer PAI-1 inhibitor to subject
- result in change of metabolic measurement
- specify PAI-1 inhibitors TM5614, TM5A15, or combination
- administer orally
- treat metabolic disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes, etc.
- decrease plasma cholesterol by 25-40%
- decrease HDL-C by 30%
- decrease LDL-C by 50%
- reduce PAI-1 activity by 50%
- reduce hepatic PCSK9 mRNA expression by 80%
- reduce plasma PCSK9 protein by 25-50%
- reduce plasma non-glycosylated PCSK9 protein
- co-administer statin and PAI-1 inhibitor
- provide method for reducing plasma LDL, HDL, cholesterol
- orally administer PAI-1 inhibitor
- co-administer PCSK9 inhibitor and PAI-1 inhibitor
- define technical and scientific terms
- describe range of values
- define "levels" and "activity"
- define "metabolic disorder", "treat", and "therapeutically effective amount"
- describe pharmaceutical composition and formulation
