                        "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that can cause other health problems such as organ failure if untreated. Hypertension is often undetected in individuals because people may have hypertension for years without exhibiting or noticing any symptoms. Moreover, there exist no reliable accepted means of predicting the future onset of hypertension in individuals. Untreated hypertension may cause damage to blood vessels and the heart. Undetected and untreated hypertension eventually may lead to heart attack and stroke. Hypertension usually develops over years and eventually affects nearly every person over time.",
                        "Monitoring blood pressure and detecting hypertension is typically only performed during a physical examination by a healthcare practitioner, and therefore many people with hypertension go undiagnosed. Wearable devices have the potential to provide continuous monitoring of pressure in a nonintrusive manner. Future healthcare applications making use of data from these devices will require means to assess current and future disease status from the data collected. Therefore, an effective technique for analyzing and assess large amounts of continuous blood pressure data could provide caregivers with a variety of valuable clinical decision-making tools.",
                        "Current applications for continuous blood pressure (BP) and blood pressure waveform measurement and analysis mainly use invasive approaches and confined to stationary complex clinical settings such as the intensive care unit (ICU). Hence, the techniques are not suitable for a wide range of applications, including personal healthcare monitoring at home.",
                        "At present, assessment of hypertensive disease relies on blood pressure measurements to determine and classify disease status. Although continuous data on blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations contain data on dynamic interactions between the autonomic nervous system and the cardiovascular system, analysis of such data is not effectively done in clinical applications. With the development of low-cost wearable monitoring systems, large quantities of dynamic pressure and heart rate data are becoming available. Therefore, a reliable and effective approach for extracting actionable diagnoses or monitoring effectiveness of interventions from these data is needed.",
                        "Non-continuous monitoring systems have been proposed, but these too are problematic. Some of these non-continuous monitoring systems are relatively portable and non-invasive. However, these conventional techniques typically provide limited data from limitations in sensor sensitivity or limitations in data analysis. Moreover, the majority of current noninvasive systems are cumbersome, since inflation of their mechanical cuff (or balloon) obstructs the normal everyday activities of life for the users. Typical blood pressure measurement systems are not continuously wearable; and the information they provide lacks the frequency and granularity required for meaningful signal processing and further, for use in artificial intelligence analysis and machine learning.",
                        "In light of these limitations and needs, and given the increased need for new health care delivery models, there is a need for methods that can provide diagnostic insight from continuous noninvasively obtained data to detect, predict, classify, and manage hypertensive disease."

Time periods where the baroreflex is controlling heart rate are labeled \u201con\u201d states, and time periods where the baroreflex is not controlling heart rate are labeled \u201coff\u201d states. As used herein, \u201cheart rate\u201d and \u201cpulse rate\u201d are interchangeable as the rate of a subject's pulse is the subject's heart rate.",

The apparatus further includes a processor configured to receive blood pressure data from the wearable sensor assembly, and perform time-series analysis on the received blood pressure data. The processor determines baroreflex functionality of the subject from the blood pressure data, and determines an indicator of cardiovascular disease state in the subject from the baroreflex activity.",

The processor may determine an indicator of hypertension with the indicator being one of a likelihood of developing hypertension, a prediction of an onset of hypertension, an identification of etiology of hypertension, a prediction to a responsiveness of a treatment, or an identification of a dysfunction associated with autonomic regulation of heart rate.",

                        "The present techniques provide devices and methods for measuring and monitoring blood flow dependent measurements over a sensing region of a subject, such as over a finger, wrist, or other peripheral arterial region. Example devices include wearable sensor devices having two or more sensors of different types.",
                        "Physiological control of arterial blood pressure (BP) is achieved via the interaction of multiple organs and organ systems. The pressure waveforms in the systemic arteries are governed by the interactions between ventricular pumping and arterial mechanics, the ionotropic and chronotropic state of the heart, and the preloads driving filling of the left and right sides of the heart. These governing processes are, in turn, regulated by the autonomic nervous system and endocrine signals, notably the baroreflex and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Since each one of these systems\u2014mechanical, autonomic, and endocrine\u2014has a direct influence on the functions of the others, no single controller of arterial pressure nor single root cause of primary hypertension has been identified. Rather, just as the physiological control of blood pressure is a multifactorial systems-level phenomenon, it may be that the pathophysiology of hypertension is most generally understood as a multifactorial phenomenon. Moreover, because chronic increases in pressure can, in principle, both cause and be caused by mechanical remodeling and changes to autonomic and renal function, it is possible that many different primary insults affecting different systems could all drive the system toward the same multifactorial pathological phenotype.",
                        "The arterial baroreflex controls heart rate via a negative feedback system, where increases in arterial pressure cause decreases in heart rate and decreases in pressure cause increases in heart rate. Dysfunction of the autonomic systems associated with the baroreflex are associate with numerous diseases and disorders. Disclosed herein are methods for analyzing time-course arterial pressure data to identify and characterize a markedly intermittent functioning of the baroreflex arc. Applying this methodology to data from rats features of the intermittent nature of the baroreflex are identified which are useful in predicting hypertensive disease and in distinguishing different etiologies of disease in different rat models of hypertension. Also, the methods may be successfully applied to analyze arterial pressure time-series data obtained from human subjects, and the features identified in the data from animal models can be identified in the human data. Further, a wearable monitor for measuring physiological data may be used to perform the measurements of the arterial pressure and heart rate.",
                        "The disclosed system and method have the potential to be adopted for numerous health care applications. For example, when a patient is diagnosed with hypertension, physicians typically start treatment by prescribing medicine to determine how the patient reacts to the medicine and specifically if the medicine is effective in treating a patients form of hypertension. A patient may be prescribed a diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker, an alpha blocker, an alpha-beta blocker, a beta blocker, an aldosterone antagonist, a renin inhibitor, a vasodilator, a central-acting agent, or another medication for medicating hypertension. Each medication, or combination of medications, prescribed are target different physiological mechanisms and the medication efficacy depends on the type of hypertension and specific cause of hypertension. Therefore, a number of trials of different medications is typically required before a proper diagnosis and prescription is found for a given hypertensive patient. It is therefore beneficial to know a classification of the hypertension to give insight into which medication is likely to be effective for a given hypertensive patient. The system and methods disclosed may allow for the classification of specific mechanisms of hypertension, and/or the ability to rule out specific types of classifications of hypertension which reduces the number of medication trials for a patient, and the amount of time and money spent for a proper diagnosis and treatment to be found. Further, the disclosed system and methods use non-perturbative techniques to determine indicators of hypertension.",
                        "FIG. 1 is an example schematic block diagram 800 illustrating the various components used in implementing an example embodiment of an autonomic baroreflex monitoring system discussed herein. A signal-processing device 802 (or \u201csignal processor\u201d) may be coupled to a patient 820 via one or more wearable sensors 816 (or a \u201cwearable sensor assembly\u201d) in accordance with executing the functions of the disclosed embodiments. The wearable sensor assembly having wearable sensors 802 may include a wrist band, an armband, a waist band, an ankle band, a head band, a patch that adheres to a patient, a watch, other jewelry with sensors, a garment, or another item that may be operatively coupled to a patient with sensors for measuring biometrics of the patient. The one or more wearable sensors 816 may be coupled to the patient via an elastic band, a Velcro band, an adhesive, a belt, or via a garment such as wearing a shirt or pants, among other means. Further, the wearable sensor assembly may be in physical contact with the patient, or the wearable sensor array may not be in direct physical contact with the patient, for example, by using optical sensors in a set of glasses.",
                        "The signal-processing device 802 may have a controller 804 operatively connected to the database 814 via a link 822 connected to an input/output (I/O) circuit 812. It should be noted that, while not shown, additional databases may be linked to the controller 804 in a known manner. The controller 804 includes a program memory 806, one or more processors 808 (may be called microcontrollers or a microprocessors), a random-access memory (RAM) 810, and the input/output (I/O) circuit 812, all of which are interconnected via an address/data bus 820. It should be appreciated that although only one processor 808 is shown, the controller 804 may include multiple microprocessors 808. Similarly, the memory of the controller 804 may include multiple RAMs 810 and multiple program memories 806. Although the I/O circuit 812 is shown as a single block, it should be appreciated that the I/O circuit 812 may include a number of different types of I/O circuits. The RAM(s) 810 and the program memories 806 may be implemented as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and/or optically readable memories, for example. A link 824, which may include one or more wired and/or wireless (Bluetooth, WLAN, etc.) connections, may operatively connect the controller 804 to a wearable sensor 816 through the I/O circuit 812. The wearable sensor 816 may be operatively connected to the patient 820. The wearable sensor 816 may include an optical heart rate sensor, a physical pressure sensor, an electrocardiography sensor, a photoplethysmography sensor, a sphygmomanometer, an inflatable cuff, a digital blood pressure monitor, or another sensor capable of measuring arterial pressure and/or pulse pressure.",
                        "The program memory 806 and/or the RAM 810 may store various applications (i.e., machine readable instructions) for execution by the processor 808. For example, an operating system 830 may generally control the operation of the signal-processing device 802 and provide a user interface to the signal-processing device 802 to implement the process 100 described herein. The program memory 806 and/or the RAM 810 may also store a variety of subroutines 832 for accessing specific functions of the signal-processing device 802. By way of example, and without limitation, the subroutines 832 may include, among other things: a subroutine for taking measurements with the wearable sensor 816, a subroutine for filtering measurement (or data) from the wearable sensor 816, a subroutine for performing signal decomposition on raw signal data from the wearable sensor 816, and a subroutine for extracting one or more features of a sensing region from the raw signal data from the wearable sensor 816. The subroutines 832 may also include other subroutines, for example, implementing software keyboard functionality, interfacing with other hardware in the signal-processing device 802, etc. The program memory 806 and/or the RAM 810 may further store data related to the configuration and/or operation of the signal-processing device 802, and/or related to the operation of the one or more subroutines 832. For example, the data may be data gathered by the wearable sensor 816, data determined and/or calculated by the processor 808, etc. In addition to the controller 804, the signal-processing device 802 may include other hardware resources. The signal-processing device 802 may also include various types of input/output hardware such as a visual display 826 and input device(s) 828 (e.g., keypad, keyboard, etc.). In an embodiment, the display 826 is touch-sensitive, and may cooperate with a software keyboard routine as one of the software routines 832 to accept user input. It may be advantageous for the signal-processing device 802 to communicate with a broader medical treatment network (not shown) through any of a number of known networking devices and techniques (e.g., through a commuter network such as an hospital or clinic intranet, the Internet, etc.). For example, the testing apparatus may be connected to a medical records database, hospital management processing system, health care professional terminals (e.g., doctor stations, nurse stations), patient monitoring systems, automated drug delivery systems such as smart pumps, smart infusion systems, automated drug delivery systems, etc. Accordingly, the disclosed embodiments may be used as part of an automated closed loop system or as part of a decision assist system.",
                        "Although depicted as separate entities or components in FIG. 1, it is understood that any or the entire signal processing functionality and/or components of the signal-processing device 802 may be combined with a wearable sensor assembly, such as the wearable sensor 816. In this manner, a wearable sensor may both gather data about the patient 820 and process the gathered data to extract one or more waveform features, as discussed further below.",
                        "Also, although depicted as a single component in FIG. 1, the wearable sensor 816 may include multiple of the same type or different types of sensors. For example, the wearable sensor 816 may include both a piezoelectric pressure sensor for measuring raw signal pressure data and a secondary sensor for collecting photoplethysmograph derived blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation data. Generally, the wearable sensor 816 may include one or more piezoelectric sensors or electrodes. In some examples, the wearable sensor 816 may be implemented with one or more of a variety of other (or secondary) sensors, such as temperature sensors, motion sensors, actigraphy sensors, galvanic skin response sensors, impedance sensors, etc.",
                        "In some examples in which the wearable sensor 816 includes a secondary sensor for collecting photoplethysmograph derived blood flow data, the secondary sensor may provide (e.g., to a signal processing computer) a waveform that is flow related. The changes in the waveform may provide information related to the arterial tone at both the site of measure and, in some cases, more centrally (i.e., at a central artery such as the aorta and carotid arteries). When compared with central aortic pressure, peripheral arterial waveforms have higher systolic pressure, lower diastolic pressure, and greater pulse pressure, but despite differences between peripheral and central arterial waveforms, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the aorta is just slightly greater than MAP in the radial artery.",
                        "Changes in the waveform from the secondary sensor along with changes in a waveform from the piezoelectric sensor (amplitude, width, time differences in peaks, delta responses to provocative movements such as breathing, volume infusion, etc.) may provide complementary information about the patient as it relates to circulating vascular volumes and vascular tone. Thus, the ability to look at these two signals together allows for determining which components are responsible for changes and as well as how best to favorably affect changes, such as providing medications to tighten or relax arterial wall tone."

Data from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) were recorded at 7 weeks, 10 weeks, and 15 weeks of age.

The dynamic coupling between MAP and RR is reflected in a close match between the model and the data in the left panel of FIG. 2B.

For example, transient pressure increases are followed by transient increases in heart rate. The lack of physiological coupling of the baroreflex is reflected in the lack of a match between model simulations and data in the right panel of FIG. 2B. An assessment of the relatively bad fits suggests an intermittent engagement and disengagement of the baroreflex-mediated control of heart rate. At times the RR interval tends to be changing in the direction predicted by the model. These time periods are identified as times when the baroreflex arc is operating in an \u201con\u201d state. Time periods when the model cannot be made to coincide with the data are identified as representing baroreflex \u201coff\u201d states.

                        "The described methods and systems have the ability to identify relatively long time periods, lasting on the order of several minutes, during which the baroreflex system is, and is not, operating in a manner in which fluctuations in arterial pressure are coupled to corresponding fluctuations in heart rate. With the techniques herein, the \u201con\u201d fraction metric distinguishes between different etiologies of disease in different rat models of hypertension. The \u201con\u201d fraction metric may therefore be useful in distinguishing between different etiologies of hypertensive disease in humans. Statistical trends in arterial pressure during \u201con\u201d versus \u201coff\u201d states provide additional classifiers of etiology and are shown to be predictive of the development of hypertension of specific etiologies in animal models. The method and associated algorithms may therefore prove useful in predicting future development of hypertensive disease in humans. Further, the \u201con\u201d fraction may predict the responsiveness to carotid baroreceptor stimulation (CBS) therapy in patients with resistant hypertension. Thus, the disclosed methods and systems may be used in early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes, severe preeclampsia, acute stroke, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, familial dysautonomia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).",
                        "Throughout this specification, plural instances may implement components, operations, or structures described as a single instance. Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.",
                        "Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.",
                        "In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.",
                        "Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.",
                        "Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connects the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).",

Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.",
                        "Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but also deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.",
