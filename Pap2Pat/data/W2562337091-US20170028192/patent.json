    "date": "2016-10-11 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A system and method to treat neuromuscular conditions, including spinal cord injury, by what is characterized as dipole (two point) cortico-muscular stimulation. Two-point stimulation, with oppositely charged electrodes, allows pulsed, direct current to pass through the cortico-muscular pathway. The electrodes are placed on nerves, muscles, or a combination of both, that are on opposite sides of the spinal column, forming a current that passes across the spinal column. Further, an active electrode can be placed on the spinal column and a reference electrode can be placed outside the central nervous system. These methods improve functional recovery of the motor pathway.",

                        "The nervous system comprises the central and the peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system consists of all of the other neural elements, namely the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord.",
                        "Damage to the nervous system may result from a traumatic injury, such as penetrating trauma or blunt trauma, or a disease or disorder including, but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diabetic neuropathy, senile dementia, stroke and ischemia.",
                        "After spinal cord injury (SCI), spared regions of the central nervous system are spontaneously capable of repairing the damaged pathway, although the process is very limited. Moreover, despite the many promising treatment strategies to improve connections across the damaged spinal cord, the strength of connectivity and functional recovery of the impaired spinal cord are still unsatisfactory. It is well known that spared axons sprout after SCI. See Murray M., Goldberger M. E., Restitution of function and collateral sprouting in the cat spinal cord: the partially hemisected animal, J. Comp. Neurol., 158(1):19-36 (1974); Bareyre F. M., Kerschensteiner M., Raineteau O., Mettenleiter T. C., Weinmann O., Schwab M. E., The injured spinal cord spontaneously forms a new intraspinal circuit in adult rats, Nat. Neurosci. 7:269-77 (2004); Brus-Ramer M., Carmel J. B., Chakrabarty S., Martin J. H., Electrical stimulation of spared corticospinal axons augments connections with ipsilateral spinal motor circuits after injury, J, Neurosci. 27:13793-13901 (2007). But fine-tuning of the process of sprouting of spared axons after SCI as well as synapse stabilization might be dependent on precise pathway-selective activity.",
                        "Electrical stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems improves neuronal connectivity, and can be employed used to improve functional recovery after neuronal injury. It is an effective method that promotes reactive sprouting through which an increase in the number of functional connections may be possible. Electrical stimulation can also improve functional connections by strengthening the weak existing synapses and/or by promoting synaptogenesis. One of the emerging concepts is that the nervous system contains latent pathways that can be awoken by electrical stimulation or pharmacological manipulation.",
                        "The majority of the methods employing electrical stimulation utilize a one-point experimental paradigm in which unipolar or bipolar stimuli are delivered at one point of the sensorimotor pathway. The effectiveness of this stimulation depends on active propagation of an action potential through spared axons. Practically, one-point stimulation would be only effective if the neuronal connections exist and can support active and successful propagation of generated potentials. Therefore, one-point stimulation would be restricted in its efficacy and inclined toward stronger connections.",
                        "The loss of neuromuscular activity after SCI leads to inevitable abnormalities that limit the effectiveness of one-point stimulation by blocking excitatory responses from traveling across the sensorimotor pathway. Some of these abnormalities are muscle atrophy and peripheral nerve inexcitability. In addition, changes of the sensorimotor pathway below and above the lesion may involve several different mechanisms; some of them may be maladaptative. This maladaptive function will bias stimuli toward connections with better integrity, further limiting the effectiveness of localized stimulation.",
                        "According to the Habbian plasticity principle, physiological processes strengthen synaptic connections when presynaptic activity correlates with postsynaptic firing. See, for example, Hebb D, Organization of Behavior, New York, Wiley (1949). This phenomenon is known as long term potentiation (\u201cLTP\u201d). LTP could be induced by high-frequency presynaptic stimulation or by pairing low-frequency stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization. LTP can also be induced if a pre-synaptic input is activated concurrently with post-synaptic input. In addition, direct current passed through a neuronal pathway can modulate the excitability of that pathway depending on the current polarity and neuronal geometry. In that, anodal stimulation would excite while cathodal stimulation inhibits neuronal activity.",
                        "Thus, there is a great desire to improve the effectiveness of electrical stimulation when treating neuromuscular conditions, such as SCI."

                        "A system and method for treating neuromuscular conditions including spinal cord injury (SCI) are disclosed herein, which employ dipole (two point) cortico-muscular stimulation (\u201cdCMS\u201d). The system and method advantageously employ a discovery that utilizing a two point method of cortico-muscular stimulation dramatically improves the performance of the skeletal muscles after SCI. Two-point stimulation, with oppositely charged electrodes, allows pulsed, direct current to pass through the cortico-muscular pathway regardless of the extent of injury and number of spared neurons. These methods enable permanent functional recovery of the motor pathway.",
                        "The research leading to the present invention has demonstrated that dCMS substantially improved muscle twitch force and spinal cord responses in control and SCI animals, and that passage of pulsed direct current across the cortico-muscular pathway promotes stronger connections between spinal motor circuits and the motor cortex.",
                        "In one exemplary embodiment, the dCMS configuration involves an active electrode at a first point and a reference electrode at a second point, and is situated such that the current passes across the spinal cord. The first and second points may be the motor cortex, muscles, or a combination thereof. In one configuration, the active electrode can be situated at the motor cortex and the reference electrode is at a contralateral muscle (e.g., a partially isolated gastrocnemius muscle). The passage of pulsed direct current across the cortico-muscular pathway overcomes many of the excitability-confounding factors previously described. The advantage of using this method of stimulation is that the passage of such current will not be dependent on factors affected by lesion such as the degree of myelination, density of existing connections, synaptic strength and/or general excitability of the sensorimotor pathway. Instead, the current will passively flow along the core conductors of the target neuronal pathway leading to the activation of the entire pathway regardless of its morphological integrity. Dipolar cortico-muscular stimulation substantially improves muscle twitch force and spinal cord responses.",
                        "In another exemplary embodiment, electrical pulses can be applied to the spinal column employing an active electrode applied thereto. At least one reference electrode is applied to a point outside the central nervous system. The electrical pulses can be employed alone, or in combination with additional electrical pulses applied to the motor cortex and/or at least one muscle to enhance neuromuscular performance. Multiple stimulator units can be used synchronously or asysnchronously to treat various traumas and/or injuries to the nervous system that are present in the brain, spinal column, or in the peripheral nerves.",
                        "The use of dCMS enhances the excitability of the cortico-muscular connections and can be used in human patients suffering from not just spinal cord injury, but also stroke, multiple sclerosis, and the like. Even humans who engage in athletic activity may use dCMS to enhance neuromuscular performance. It can practically be employed to strengthen or awaken any weak or dormant pathway in the nervous system.",

The method includes: placing at least one active electrode at, or in proximity to, or over, a first point, and at least one reference electrode at, or in proximity to, a second point, wherein the first point is located at the central nerve system of a vertebrate being, and the second point is located outside the central nervous system of the vertebrate being, such as at the abdomen; and enhancing a neural connection between the first point and the second point by passing an electrical current between the at least one active electrode and the at least one reference electrode. In one embodiment, the reference electrode is a split electrode.",
                        "Trans-spinal direct current (tsDC) may be used to provide stimulation to the damaged or dysfunctional portions of the central nervous system and/or peripheral nerves. Trans-cranial DC stimulation (tcDC) may be used to modulate the excitability of the motor cortex, ameliorate the perception of pain, modulate cognitive functions, and/or treat depression.

When multiple electrodes are said to be placed in proximity to a point, a predominant portion of electrical current applied to the multiple electrodes flow through the point, and consequently through an element including that point.",
                        "As used herein, a \u201cpoint\u201d refers to a tissue site of an animal or a human.",
                        "As used herein, an element is \u201cconfigured to\u201d perform an act if the element is shaped, and includes all necessarily intrinsic features, to enable performance of the act as a natural consequence of having the shape and the necessary feature.",

Therefore, an active electrode can be a positive electrode or a negative electrode depending on the polarity of the applied electrical pulse.",

A reference electrode may be held at a constant electrostatic potential, or an electrical pulse may be applied to the reference electrode such that the electrical pulse applied to the reference electrode has a polarity that is the opposite of the polarity of the electrical pulse applied to at least one active electrode. If at least one active electrode is at least one positive electrode, a reference electrode is a negative electrode, and vice versa.",

                        "The application of dipole cortico-muscular stimulation (dCMS) results in a remarkable enhancement of the excitability of the motor pathway. This enhancement was observed in both animals and humans. In control animals and in SCI animals, which had severe locomotor impairment associated with signs of spastic syndrome, the effect was observed both in the ipsilateral and contralateral pathways. Maximal threshold of the ipsilateral cortex was reduced. Improvement in muscle strength was accompanied by an increase in spontaneous activity and potentiation of evoked responses of the spinal motoneurons. Spinal motoneuronal responses and muscle twitches evoked by stimulation of the contralateral, non-treated M1 (motor cortex) were significantly enhanced as well. The dCMS-induced effect persisted beyond the phase of stimulation and extended through the entire period of the experiment as explained in detail further below.",
                        "The electrodes may be attached topically on the surface, or underneath the skin, or surgically implanted. In one embodiment, an active electrode is situated on the motor cortex (first point) and a reference electrode is situated on the desired muscle (second point), allowing the current to travel across the spinal cord. In another embodiment, an active electrode is situated on the desired muscle (first point) and a reference electrode is situated on the motor cortex (second point), again allowing the current to travel across the spinal cord. In yet another embodiment, neither the active electrode nor the reference electrode is placed on the motor cortex. Instead, both the active electrode and reference electrode are placed on desired first and second point muscles, which are on opposite sides of the body, allowing the current to travel across the spinal cord.",

FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary connection scheme employing a dipolar cortico-muscular stimulator. A dipolar cortico-muscular stimulator can include a stimulator box with a LCD Display or computer connections to a software control system.

The regulations of both outputs are synchronized to make the absolute value of the difference between these two outputs always the same. Thus, when the positive output increases the negative output should decrease the same amount. For example, when the positive output is increased from +4 V to +5 V, the negative output decreases from \u22121 V to 0 V.",
                        "Digital-to-analog converter (DAC) can be used to provide analog output, i.e., stimulation, through analog outputs of the stimulator box. The DACs can produce constant DC voltage levels or waveforms under software control. The output of the DACs may be fed through a programmable attenuation network to produce different output ranges. The signal may be then split into a positive and negative output through buffer amplifiers.",
                        "Optionally, each of the electrode wires can be split and connected to multiple locations. For example, active electrode can be split into multiple wires each with its own electrode. This is important in human application in case more areas needed to be stimulated. For example, at the cortex, an operator can use only one active electrode for focal stimulation or two active electrodes for more broad but less painful stimulation. Also, at the muscle, the operator can include more parts of the limb in the same session. Individual electrode size should be about 5 cm2.",

Such an electrode can be sized and configured to be placed at, or in proximity to, the motor cortex of a mammal having limbs or the motor cortex of a human. The at least one active electrode and the at least one reference electrode can be placed on the vertebrate being such that the at least one path of the electrical current includes a motor pathway between the motor cortex and a muscle. The first point can be a point at the motor cortex and one of the second point can be a point at a muscle. Alternatively, the second point can be a point at the motor cortex and the first point can be a point at a muscle.",

Thus, all of the at least one active electrode and the at least one reference electrode can be sized and configured to be placed at, or in proximity to, a muscle in a limb of a mammal having limbs or a human limb. The at least one active electrode and the at least one reference electrode can be placed on the vertebrate being such that the first point is a point at a first muscle, and the second point is a point at a second muscle. The at least one path of the electrical current can include at least one first lower motoneuron connected to the first point and at least one second lower motoneuron connected to the second point.",

For example, a plurality of first electrodes can be placed at, or in proximity with, the motor cortex, and a plurality of second electrodes can be placed at, or in proximity with, a muscle. Further, a plurality of first electrodes can be placed at, or in proximity with, a first muscle, and a plurality of second electrodes can be placed at, or in proximity with, a second muscle that is different from the first muscle. In each of the examples above, the at least one active electrode can be the plurality of first electrodes and the at least one reference electrode can be the plurality of second electrodes, or vice versa.",

In this case, the method of the present disclosure can include attaching each of the at least one active electrode and the at least one reference electrode to the motor cortex or a muscle of the vertebrate being topically, underneath a skin, and/or by surgical implantation.",
                        "In still yet another embodiment, the system can include at least one probe for identifying a motoneuron that affects movement of a muscle of the vertebrate being and located in the spinal column by applying electrical voltage thereto. An example of such at least one probe is the pair of pure iridium microelectrodes illustrated in FIG. 1A and labeled as \u201cRec.\u201d If provided, the at least one probe can be employed to identifying a motoneuron that affects movement of a muscle of the vertebrate being in the spinal column. The muscle is subsequently attached to an active electrode or a reference electrode. The at least one probe can be employed to determine a maximal stimulus strength for the motoneuron at which no further increase in muscle contraction of the muscle is observed with an increase in strength of electrical stimulation to the motoneuron. Then, a voltage differential between at least one active electrode and the at least one electrode during the passing of the current can be set in proportion to the determined maximal stimulus strength. For example, the voltage differential can be set at a same voltage as the maximal stimulus strength, or can be a predefined percentage of the maximal stimulus strength (e.g., 25% to 200%).",
                        "In one embodiment, the stimulator can be linked to EMG (electro-myograph, muscle activity monitor) monitor to adjust the level (e.g. 50%) of muscle contraction at which the treatment session will be delivered. Similar monitor for vital signs (heart rate; blood pressure, breathing rate) can be added. Electrode gel can be used to prevent burns due to electrolysis.",
                        "Another method of employing a dipolar cortico-muscular stimulator is illustrated in FIG. 11. The stimulation system includes multiple independent stimulator units that are integrated in a single system, either in one box or in a plurality of boxes with electrical connections therebetween. A first stimulator unit, labeled \u201cpolarizing,\u201d delivers a polarizing current between a point on a spinal column and a point located outside of the central nervous system. Optionally, a second stimulator unit, labeled \u201cbrain,\u201d can deliver current to the motor cortex either synchronously with the polarization current or asynchronously with the polarization current to reinforce the stimulation provided by the first stimulator. Optionally, a third stimulator unit, labeled \u201cmuscle 1,\u201d can deliver current to a muscle area either synchronously with the polarization current or asynchronously with the polarization current to reinforce the stimulation provided by the first stimulator. The third stimulator unit can be used with the second stimulator unit, or without the second stimulator unit. Additional stimulator units, represented by a fourth stimulator unit labeled \u201cmuscle 2,\u201d can be used with the third stimulator unit to deliver monopolar negative current to another muscle area.",
                        "The points at which the polarizing current is applied to a vertebrate being are schematically illustrated in FIG. 12. While a mouse is schematically shown in FIG. 2, this configuration can be employed for any vertebrate being including a human. Specifically, an active electrode, labeled \u201ctsDC,\u201d is placed on a first point located at the spinal column, which can be at any level within the spinal column between, and including, the first spinal cord level and the last spinal cord level. A reference electrode, labeled \u201cRef,\u201d can be placed on a second point located at any area other than the area of the central nervous system, i.e., outside of the brain and the spinal column. Because simulation of an area of the spinal column contacted by the active electrode is preferred than stimulation of the area contacted by the reference electrode, the reference electrode is preferably placed at some distance away from the spinal column. While the reference electrode is shown as a single electrode in FIG. 12, the reference electrode can be replaced with a plurality of reference electrodes as illustrated in FIG. 11. Using a plurality of reference electrodes instead of a single reference electrode enhances the effect of the electrical stimulation provided by the active stimulus because the current density at the plurality of reference electrodes can be maintained low, while the current density at the active electrode can be maintained high.",
                        "Typically, the voltage at the reference electrode(s) is held constant, and the voltage at the active electrode has the form of electrical pulses with a pulse duration 0.5 to 5 ms and a frequency from 0.5 Hz to 5 Hz, although lesser and greater pulse durations and lesser and greater frequencies can also be employed. The polarity of the electrical pulse applied to the active electrode can be either positive or negative depending on applications.",
                        "In case the vertebrate being is a human, a pair of reference electrodes placed on an anterior pelvis can provide effective stimulation to an area of the spinal column. One of the most effective configurations for placement of a pair of reference electrodes employs a point at the anterior superior iliac spine on the right side and a point at the anterior superior iliac spine on the left side. In this case, a second point for placing a reference electrode in an embodiment employing a single reference electrode is replaced by a second point and an additional point on which two reference electrodes are placed. In other words, a reference electrode for spinal polarizing current can be implemented as a pair of reference electrodes that are split and placed over the right and left anterior superior iliac spines. The pair of reference electrodes is held at the same electrostatic potential.",
                        "The location of the first point, i.e., the point at which the active electrode is placed, depends on the nature of the neuromuscular condition for which the treatment is performed. The location of the first point can be selected to maximize the effect of the treatment. For example, if the treatment is intended to improve the neuromuscular condition of a vertebrate being for injuries suffered at a location in the spinal column, the first point can be located in a spinal cord level immediately above, i.e., immediately more proximal to the brain than, the site of the spinal injury. In other words, for treatment of a spinal cord injury, the active electrode of polarizing current can be placed so that the primary current passes through the injury site. An active electrode is placed at the spinal cord level immediately above the injury site, and reference electrodes can be placed as described above. In one embodiment, repetitive stimulations at the brain (pulsed DC current that are applied synchronously with, or asynchronously from, the primary electrical current through the active electrode and the reference electrode(s)) can be paired with the polarizing spinal current.",
                        "If the treatment is intended to improve the neuromuscular condition of a vertebrate being for conditions caused by a trauma or a dysfunction in the brain, the first point can be located at the spinal cord level one, i.e., the part of the spinal column closest to the brain. Conditions caused by a trauma or a dysfunction in the brain include such disabilities as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease), traumatic brain injury, stroke, etc. In other words, for treatment of conditions where the injury is located in the brain, the polarizing electrode can be located on the spinal area innervating the target limb. For treatment of conditions affecting lower extremities, the active polarizing electrode should be situated at vertebral level T10 to L1 above the lumbar enlargement. For treatment of conditions affecting upper extremities, the active polarizing electrode can be placed at the level of T2 and below. In one embodiment, repetitive stimulations at the brain (pulsed DC current that are applied synchronously with, or asynchronously from, the primary electrical current through the active electrode and the reference electrode(s)) can be paired with the polarizing spinal current.",
                        "For treating a condition such as ALS, stimulation intervention can also be applied to target muscles (in the form of localized pulsed DC current) affected by the condition, simultaneously with application of the polarizing current to a spinal cord region innervating the target muscles and application of local stimulation to the motor cortex (in the form of localized pulsed DC current). These treatments should be repeated at different areas according to the condition.",

Conditions caused by an injury or a disability located at a nerve include, for example, peripheral palsy, Erb's palsy, and/or other peripheral nerve injuries due to nerve compression, tension, or torsion (e.g., sciatica). For treating a condition such as Erb's palsy, stimulation intervention can also be applied to target muscles (in the form of localized pulsed DC current) affected by the condition, simultaneously with application of the polarizing current to a spinal cord region innervating the target muscles and application of local stimulation to the motor cortex (in the form of localized pulsed DC current). These treatments should be repeated at different areas according to the condition.",

The local electrical stimulation to the motor cortex can be applied employing a concentric electrode pair as illustrated in FIG. 12, or can be employed by a set of electrodes, e.g., a third electrode and a fourth electrode that are placed at two different points at the motor cortex.

FIG. 12 schematically illustrates an exemplary placement scheme for the additional electrodes in which the additional electrodes are placed on a forelimb of a mouse. In general, at least one pair of additional electrodes can be placed at one or multiple pairs of points on any part of the body excluding the central nervous system, and particularly at any limb.",

Further, the third stimulator unit, labeled \u201cmuscle 1,\u201d can deliver monopolar negative current to a muscle area either synchronously with the polarization current or asynchronously with the polarization current to reinforce the stimulation provided by the first stimulator. Selecting the polarity of the electrical stimulations so that the voltages applied to the motor cortex is in general positive and the voltages applied to the at least one muscle is in general negative can enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, especially when the electrical stimulations are applied synchronously.",

In addition, the number of electrodes per connection (splitting into more than one electrode, e.g. 4) can be as in the previous design as described above. For some applications, a dipolar cortico-muscular stimulator in this configuration is more preferable for human intervention because the stimulator gives more flexibility in designing stimulation patterns, and can be safer and less painful.",

                        "In general, direct current (DC) stimulation is a non-invasive technique used to modulate the excitability of the central nervous system. When DC stimulation is delivered trans-cranially, a positively- or negatively-charged stimulating electrode (anode or cathode, respectively) is positioned at the cortical area to be stimulated, while a reference electrode is usually situated at a distance. Trans-cranial DC stimulation (tcDC) is used to modulate the excitability of the motor cortex, ameliorate the perception of pain, modulate cognitive functions, and/or treat depression. The effect of DC stimulation depends on the topography of neurons relative to the applied field, interactions between functional neuronal circuits, and the polarity of the electrode. For example, while cathodal stimulation depresses neuronal activity, anodal stimulation activates neurons.",
                        "The spinal cord contains various populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that mediate cortical and sub-cortical inputs. By acting on these interneurons, as well as motoneurons and ascending and descending processes, DC stimulation at the spinal level could exert modulatory effects on cortical and sub-cortical inputs to the spinal cord. Although DC stimulation has been found to improve functional recovery after spinal cord injury, only a few studies have investigated the effects of trans-spinal direct current (tsDC) on the excitability of spinal neurons, and its effects on corticomotoneuronal transmission have never been investigated.",
                        "Research leading to the present disclosure show differential modulatory effects of tsDC polarity on spontaneous activity, which are shown below. Cortically-elicited triceps surae (TS) twitches were increased during cathodal trans-spinal direct current (c-tsDC), then depressed after termination, and were decreased during anodal trans-spinal direct current (a-tsDC), then potentiated after termination. While a-tsDC and rCES produced similar effects as a-tsDC alone, c-tsDC and rCES showed the greatest improvement in cortically-elicited TS twitches.",
                        "In one embodiment, DC stimulation can be employed to improve spinal responses to cortical stimulation. In many neurological disorders, connectivity between the cortex and spinal cord is compromised (e.g., spinal cord injury or stroke). Stimulation protocols can be employed to strengthen spinal responses. As illustrated in the studies described below, neuronal activity is important in shaping c-tsDC after-effects. Specifically, c-tsDC can optimize cortico-spinal activity during stimulation, and depress it at other times. The ability of c-tsDC to interact with cortical activity to cause different outcomes is an interesting phenomenon that can support many clinical uses of c-tsDC. Translating this to rehabilitative strategies, either artificial cortical stimulation (when voluntarily muscle activation is impossible) or voluntary training during the application of c-tsDC can be employed to strengthen signal responses. Moreover, the depressive effect of c-tsDC can be used to manage spasticity resulting from many neurologic disorders.",
                        "C-tsDC can cause motoneurons to be more responsive to synaptic activation, but less inclined to generate spontaneous activity. This may explain why cortically-elicited TS twitches were potentiated during c-tsDC application. Moreover, pre-synaptic hyperpolarization has been shown to increase excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs). See Eccles J., Kostyuk, P. G., Schmidt, R. F., The effect of electric polarization of the spinal cord on central afferent fibres and on their excitatory synaptic action, J. Physiol. 162: 138-150 (1962); Hubbard J. I. and Willis W. D., Hyperpolarization of mammalian motor nerve terminals, J. Physiol. 163: 115-137 (1962); Hubbard J. I., and Willis W. D., Mobilization of transmitter by hyperpolarization. Nature 193: 174-175 (1962). Such hyperpolarization is expected to occur in cortico-spinal tract terminals and in spinal interneurons between the cortico-spinal tract and spinal motoneurons. Thus, nerve terminal hyperpolarization and dendrite depolarization induced by c-tsDC would cause potentiation of cortically-elicited TS twitches.",
                        "In a study leading to the present disclosure presented below, cortically-elicited TS twitches were depressed following c-tsDC and potentiated following a-tsDC. DC stimulation of the brain has similar results, as anodal stimulation increases while cathodal stimulation decreases the excitability of the motor cortex in humans and in mice. Anodal-induced excitability appears to depend on membrane depolarization, while cathodal-induced depression depends on membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, after-effects of both anodal and cathodal stimulation involve the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor.",
                        "Pairing ICES with c-tsDC can not only prevent depression of cortically-elicited TS twitches after c-tsDC termination, but remarkably improve twitches. C-tsDC seems to induce a polarizing pattern as shown in FIG. 19, including pre-synaptic hyperpolarization and post-synaptic depolarization within the corticomotoneuronal pathway.",
                        "In theory, neuronal compartments in close proximity to the negative electrode should depolarize, and distant compartments should hyperpolarize. Therefore, excitability of neurons with dendrites oriented dorsally and axons oriented ventrally should increase, and excitability of neurons oriented in the opposite direction (ventral to dorsal) should decrease. Reversing the direction of the polarizing current should result in opposite changes of membrane potential. The negative (\u2212) and positive (+) signs indicate the status of the trans-membrane potential. CT, corticospinal tract; IN, interneuron; MN, motoneuron.",
                        "This pattern, combined with rCES, would evoke long-term potentiation. Specifically, pre-synaptic hyperpolarization has been shown to increase the size of EPSPs, which would subsequently increase neurotransmitter release and thereby cortical input. Although a low frequency stimulation was applied to the motor cortex in the study described below, the actual frequency of cortical input was probably much higher. In addition, post-synaptic depolarization would activate the NMDA receptor. The association between pre-synaptic increase of neurotransmitter release and steady post-synaptic depolarization would trigger the induction of long-term potentiation. This could serve as the main mechanism for c-tsDC-induced enhancement of cortically-elicited TS twitches. Furthermore, reduction of inhibitory inputs to spinal circuits could also mediate the after-effects of paired ICES and c-tsDC."

APS was developed to quantify the number of muscle tone abnormalities demonstrated by animals after SCI in two situations: on ground and off ground. The following rating scale was used: 0, no abnormalities; 1, for each of the following abnormalities: limb crossing of midline, abduction, and extension or flexion of the hip joint, paws curling or fanning, knee flexion or extension, ankle dorsi or planter flexion. The total score was the sum of abnormalities from both hindlimbs. The maximal score in APS was 12. Abnormal patterns were usually accompanied by spasmodic movements of the hindlimbs.",

Animals were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine (90/10 mg/kg i.p.), which was found to reserve corticospinal evoked potential. Electrophysiological procedures started \u02dc45 min after the first injection of anesthesia to perform the experiments at intermediate to light levels of anesthesia, as recommended by Zandieh and colleagues. See Zandieh S., Hopf R., Redl H., Schlag M. G., The effect of ketamine/xylazine anesthesia on sensory and motor evoked potentials in the rat. Spinal Cord, 41:16-22 (2003). This was determined by the presence of front or hind limb withdrawal reflex. As needed, anesthesia was kept at this level using supplemental dosages (\u02dc5% of the original dose).",
                                "The entire dorsal side of each animal was shaved. The skin covering the two hindlimbs, lumbar spine, and the skull was removed. The two gastrocnemii muscles (right and left) were carefully separated from the surrounded tissue preserving blood supply and nerves. The tendon of each of the muscles was threaded with a hook shaped 0-3 surgical silk, which was connected to the force transducers. Next, a laminectomy was performed in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lumbar vertebrae (below the lesion in animals with SCI); the 13th rib was used as a bone land mark to identify the level of spinal column. Since spinal cord levels are \u02dc3 levels displaced upward relative to vertebral levels, the recording was assumed to be performed at spinal cord levels: 5th and 6th lumbar and 1st sacral. A craniotomy was made to expose the primary motor cortex (M1) (usually the right M1) of the hindlimb muscles located between 0 to \u22121 mm from the Bregma and 0 to 1 mm from midline. The dura was left intact. The exposed motor cortical area was explored with a stimulating electrode to locate the motor point from which the strongest contraction of the contralateral gastrocnemius muscle was obtained using the weakest stimuli. In experiments aimed to test the effect of dCMS on nonstimulated motor pathway, two craniotomies were made over the right and left hind limb areas of M1.",
                                "Both hind and fore limbs and the proximal end of the tail were rigidly fixed to the base. Both knees were also fixed into the base to prevent transmitting any movement from stimulated muscles to the body and vice versa. Muscles were attached to force displacement transducers and the muscle length was adjusted to obtain the strongest twitch force (optimal length). The head was fixed in a custom made clamping system. The whole setup was placed on an anti-vibration table. Animals were kept warm during the experiment with radiant heat.",

Paired stainless steel stimulating electrode (\u02dc15 mm spacing; 550 \u03bcm diameter) was placed on the belly of the gastrocnemius muscle. The same electrode was alternated between left and right muscles according to experimental procedure. Electrodes were then connected to stimulator outputs. Extracellular recordings were made with pure iridium microelectrodes (0.180 shaft diameter; 1-2 \u03bcm tip; 5.0 M\u03a9). Two microelectrodes were inserted through two small openings that were carefully made into the spinal dura matter on each half (right and left) of the spinal cord. The insertion was made at approximately the same segmental level of the spinal cord. Reference electrodes were placed in the tissue slightly rostral to the recording sites. The ground electrodes were connected to the flap of skin near the abdomen. Motorized micromanipulators were used to advance the microelectrodes into the ventral horns. Extracellular activity was passed through a standard head stage, amplified, filtered (bandpass, 100 Hz to 5 KHz), digitized at 4 KHz, and stored in the computer for further processing. A power lab data acquisition system and LabChart 7 software by ADInstruments, Inc, CO, USA were used to acquire and analyze the data.",

As described by Porter, the presence of antidromically-evoked response with a short latency (3.45 ms) indicated that the recording electrode was placed in the vicinity of the neuron innervating stimulated muscle. See Porter R., Early facilitation at corticomotoneuronal neuronal synapses, J. Physiol. 207:733-745 (19700. These recordings were also used to calculate the latency of ipsilateral and contralateral spinal responses to muscle stimulation. A cortical pre-test stimulation of 10 pulses (anodal monopolar) at maximal stimulus strength (usually +8 to +10V) was applied to the primary motor cortex (M1). Maximal stimulus strength was defined as the strength of stimulation when no further increase in muscle contraction was observed. This was also used to calculate the maximal threshold of M1 stimulation.",

The positive and negative voltage outputs were connected to electrodes situated on the primary motor cortex (M1), and on the contralateral gastrocnemius muscle, respectively. Each of the two gastrocnemii muscles was attached to a force transducer (not shown). Recording from single motoneuron (Rec) was performed simultaneously on each side of the spinal cord below the lesion. In FIG. 1A, IGM represents the ipsilateral gastrocnemius muscle, and CGM represents the contralateral gastrocnemius muscle.",
                                "Specifically, the negative output was connected to an electrode situated on the gastrocnemius muscle and the positive electrode was at M1. The voltage strength and polarity were computer-controlled. The strength of dCMS stimulation was adjusted so that contraction of the ipsilateral muscle (to M1) was at maximal strength which was reached just before the appearance of tail contraction (visually observed). This level of response was achieved by simultaneously applying a negative output (range, \u22122.8 to \u22121.8 V) to the muscle and positive output (range, +2.2 to +3.2 V) to M1. At this maximal strength, dCMS was delivered (100 pulses, 1 ms pulse duration, 1 Hz frequency), 15 to 20 seconds after the stimulating paradigm was ended, a post-test (with identical parameters as pre-test) stimuli were delivered to M1.",

The experimental procedure included three phases designed to stimulate the preparation and to evaluate its reactions to dCMS. The force of muscle contraction and cortically-evoked spinal responses were evaluated before and after the application of dCMS in Pre-test and Post-test phases by application of ten monopolar pulses. The type of stimulation and location of the stimulation and recording electrodes was the same in these two phases. During dCMS phase the preparation was stimulated by application of the positive and negative pulses to the motor cortex (M1) and contralateral gastrocnemius muscle (CGM) respectively. While the number of pulses delivered during Pre- and Post-test phases was the same (10), the number of pulses delivered during dCMS was 100. The duration (1 ms) and the frequency of stimulation (1 Hz) were the same in all three phases of the experiment. The shape of the stimulating current at each phase is shown. There was a continuous recording of ipsilateral and contralateral muscle twitches and evoked and spontaneous spinal activity during the entire experiment.",

In a subgroup of animals, the maximal threshold of M1 was re-tested. In addition, in this subgroup, in order to determine the long lasting effect of dCMS, the magnitude of cortically-evoked muscle twitches and spinal responses were retested every 20 min for 60 min after dCMS.",

Spike Histogram software was used to discriminate and analyze extracellular motoneuronal activity. All data were reported as group means\u00b1standard deviation (SD). Paired student's t-test was performed for before-after comparison or two sample student's t-test to compare two groups; statistical significance at the 95% confidence level (p<0.05). To compare responses from both sides of spinal cords recorded from control animals and from animals with SCI, one way ANOVA was performed followed with Solm-Sidak post hoc analysis.

The motoneuronal spike was also accompanied by a distinctive and crisp sound recorded with a loud speaker. Second criterion used to identify spinal motoneurons was their response to the stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle. Stimulating the gastrocnemius muscle produced a short latency antidromically-generated response that was recorded from motor neurons in the ipsilateral spinal cord. Simultaneously, the microelectrode on the contralateral side of the spinal cord recorded a response that had relatively longer latency than the one picked up from the ipsilateral side. In FIG. 3A, three representative conditions were seen during the identification of motoneurons. The two panels, far left and middle, show simultaneous motoneuronal responses to stimulated gastrocnemius muscle. The far left panel shows the response of the motoneuron in the ipsilateral side. The middle panel shows the response of the motoneuron in the contralateral side. The far right panel shows a situation when the motoneuron was not responding to the antidromic stimulation of the homonymous gastrocnemius muscle. This confirmed that the unit was not innervating the stimulated gastrocnemius muscle. Third, as depicted in FIG. 3 B the muscle twitches (lower panel) were correlated with motoneuron activity (upper panel). This association between spontaneous spikes and muscle twitches was used to confirm the connection. FIG. 3B shows typical spike generated by motoneuron. Finally, it was histologically confirmed that recording electrodes were localized in the ventral horn of the spinal cord.",

Lower fidelity index value indicates better association between spinal responses and their corresponding muscle twitches. In other words, it means better ability of a spinal response to induce muscle contraction. Therefore, changes in this index may indicate changes in relation between spinal and peripheral excitability.",

                                "As expected, muscle stimulation resulted in significant reduction in muscle twitch force (\u221220.28\u00b17.02%, p<0.001, t-test) (n=5, 3 SCI and 2 control).

                                "In general, the results show remarkable enhancement of the excitability of the motor pathway induced by unilateral application of dCMS. This enhancement was observed in control animals and in SCI animals that had severe locomotor impairment associated with signs of spastic syndrome. The effect was observed both in the ipsilateral and contralateral pathways. Maximal threshold of the ipsilateral cortex has been reduced. Improvement in muscle strength was accompanied by an increase in spontaneous activity and potentiation of evoked responses of the spinal motoneurons. Spinal motoneuronal responses and muscle twitches evoked by stimulation of the contralateral, non-treated M1 were significantly enhanced as well. The dCMS-induced effect persisted beyond the phase of stimulation and extended through the entire period of the experiment (60 min).",
                                "Bilateral responses to cortical stimulation have been routinely observed. They can be mediated by interhemispheric connections, ipsilateral cortico-spinal connections (5-6% of the contralateral projections), or commissural spinal neurons. As seen in FIGS. 17F and 18B, ipsilateral responses to unilateral stimulation of motor cortex evoked larger responses in SCI animals compared to controls. These results further support the idea that ipsilateral corticospinal projections are more efficient in evoking muscle contraction after SCI.",
                                "The mechanism of dCMS-induced increase in the efficiency of the motor pathway is not clear and one can only speculate what processes have been modulated. It is obvious that the potentiation in muscle force during dCMS is not like the potentiation seen after neuromuscular stimulation. See Luke R, Harris W. Bobet J, Sanelli L, Bennett D J, Tail Muscles Become Slow but Fatigable in Chronic Sacral Spinal Rats With Spasticity. J. Neurophysiol. 95:1124-1133 (2006). While neuromuscular stimulation leads to a brief potentiation of muscle force followed by a steep reduction in force, dCMS leads to a gradually proceeding increase in the amplitude of cortically-elicited muscle contraction. Since the enhancement occurred at contra- and ipsilateral sides, the locus of potentiation is most likely either spinal or supraspinal. The enhancement of cortically-elicited muscle contraction was accompanied by a reduction in maximal threshold to cortical stimulation, an increase in spinal motoneuronal responses, and an increase in cortically-elicited spinal motoneuronal responses. Therefore, one can assume that improvements occurred simultaneously at several functional levels of the corticomotoneuronal pathway.",
                                "In view of the fact that the current employed in the stimulation paradigm was always positive at one end and negative at the other, the stimulation can be considered in part polarizing. In the past, the paradigm of polarizing current was used to study excitability of different parts of the nervous system. See Landau W. M., Bishop G. H., Clare M. H., Analysis of the form and distribution of cortical potentials under the influence of polarizing currents, J. Neurophysiol. 27:788-813 (1964); Gorman A. L. F., Differential patterns of activation of the pyramidal system elicited by surface anodal and cathodal cortical stimulation, J. NeuroPhysiol. 29:547-64 (1965); Terzoulo C. A., Bullock T. H., Measurement of imposed voltage gradient adequate to modulate neuronal firing, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 42:687-694 (1956); Bindman L. J., Lippold O. C. J., Redfearn J. W. T., Long-lasting changes in the level of the electrical activity of the motor cortex produced by polarizing currents, Nature 196:584-585 (1962). In these studies, polarizing current produced potential membrane changes in which hyperpolarization occurs at cellular parts near the positive electrode and depolarization occurs near the negative electrode. Complying with this rule, for example, the situation of two polarizing electrodes on the spinal cord (one on the ventral side and the other on the dorsal side) produced changes in membrane and spike potentials of primary fibres from muscles. See Landau et al. supra.",
                                "The results of the above study suggest that the current is polarizing during the brief, steady moment of pulse duration (1 ms). Given the electrodes placement, in which negative at the muscle and positive at the cortex, the cell body of corticospinal neurons is expected to hyperpolarize and their nerve terminals depolarize. Moreover, spinal motoneurons expected to hyperpolarize at the cell body and dendrites, and depolarize at the neuromuscular junction.",
                                "According to cell topography relative to the applied electrical field, membrane potential changes are also expected to occur at intervening interneurons. These membrane changes that occur briefly during each pulse of dCMS, seem to prime corticomotoneuronal pathway for potentiation. In addition, the stimulating pulse has two more periods: rising (0.250 ms) and falling (0.250 ms). These changing periods caused a flow of current that exited from one end and entered at the other end of the corticomotoneuronal pathway. This idea is supported by the observation of stimulus artifact picked up by electrodes in the spinal cord. The current flowed throughout the entire pathway independent from the factors confounding active excitability (see introduction). This might cause activation of the corticomotoneuronal pathway at any possible excitable site/s. This will ensure eliciting spike-timing-dependent plasticity that might be one of the mechanisms that mediates the effect of the dCMS. See Dan Y, Poo M, Spiking Timing-dependent plasticity: From synapse to perception, Physiol. Rev., 86:1033-1048 (2006) for spike-timing-dependent plasticity.",
                                "In addition, the high frequency multiple spinal responses, evoked during dCMS, can, in principle, induce long-term potentiation. Because dCMS can engage a variety of neuronal mechanisms as well as non-neuronal activity, its effect might be a combination of many changes along the corticomotoneuronal pathway.",
                                "The dCMS-induced enhancement of muscle force has been observed both in control and injured animals. The mechanisms responsible for this amplification in these two groups of animals may overlap, but they do not have to be identical. Although, as discussed above the potentiating effect of dCMS could be mediated by strengthening synaptic responses, the nature and source of these changes may differ substantially in the motor pathway of control and injured animals. Axonal sprouting is probably the primary source of synaptic connections in the damaged spinal cord. See Murray et al. supra; Bareyre et al., supra; and Brus-Ramer et al. supra. However, axonal sprouting does not grant the formation of functional connections. Therefore, one of the probable mechanisms that may mediate the potentiating effect of dCMS is the refining and strengthening of the weak synaptic connections that have resulted from sprouting. Moreover, dormant connections that exist throughout the sensorimotor system may be activated and become functional after dCMS. See Brus-Ramer M., Carmel J. B., Martin J. H., Motor cortex bilateral motor representation depends on subcortical and interhemispheric interactions, J. Neurosci. 29:6196-206 (2009). Potentiating the spared normal connections could also happen after dCMS. While in control animals, potentiating of normal connections and facilitating dormant connections might be the only processes that mediate the effect of dCMS. The results show that dCMS stimulation was almost twice as effective in injured animals comparing with controls. This indicates that injured spinal cord is more prone for dCMS stimulation and posses extra mechanisms mediating the dCMS effect.",
                                "In SCI animals, even before the application of dCMS, the spinal motoneurons were responding more aggressively to cortical stimulation than controls. Nevertheless, very weak or no muscle contraction was seen (FIG. 6). This might be due to one of two mechanisms. One would be located in the spinal cord caudal to the lesion and/or the other being, the inexcitable peripheral nerves and/or the irresponsiveness of the muscle. Caudal to the lesion, the activity of the spinal motoneuron pool was probably desynchronized as a result of reorganization. Supporting this idea are the findings by Brus-Ramer and colleagues. See Brus-Ramer et al. supra. Bruce-Ramer et al. reported that chronic stimulation of corticospinal tracts resulted in preferential axonal outgrowth toward the ventral horn. This indicates that inter motoneuronal connections are dynamic processes, which may change by decentralization. Inexcitable peripheral axons were found in patients with SCI. See Lin C. S., Macefield V. G., Elam M., Wallin B. G., Engel S., Kiernan M. C., Axonal changes in spinal cord injured patients distal to the site of injury. Brain, 130:985-994 (2007). Assuming that the axons in SCI animals are in similar conditions, they could experience an action potential failure resulting in reduced muscle contraction. Muscle atrophy is always seen in animals with SCI and humans. See, for example, Ahmed Z., Wieraszko A., Combined effects of acrobatic exercise and magnetic stimulation on the functional recovery after spinal cord lesions, J. Neurotrauma, 25:1257-1269 (2008); Liu M., Bose P., Walter G. A., Thompson F. J., Vandenborne K., A longitudinal study of skeletal muscle following spinal cord injury and locomotor training, Spinal Cord, 46:488-93 (2008); Shah P. K., Stevens J. E., Gregory C. M., Pathare N. C., Jayaraman A., Bickel S. C., Bowden M., Behrman A. L., Walter G. A., Dudley G. A., Vandenborne K., Lowerextremity muscle cross-sectional area after incomplete spinal cord injury, Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 87:772-778 (2006); Gordon T., Mao J., Muscle atrophy and procedures for training after spinal cord injury, Phys. Ther. 74:50-60 (1994). This might also be one of the reasons why spinal motoneurons responses were not translated adequately into muscle contraction.",
                                "The adequacy of motoneuronal responses was quantified by calculating the fidelity index, which is the ratio of spinal response to muscle twitch force. The dCMS-induced changes in fidelity index were opposite in control and injured animals. While this index has been reduced in injured animals, indicating improvement in the effectiveness of the motor pathway, it had increased in control animals suggesting lowering of the pathway effectiveness probably due to fatigue interference. Therefore, one can imply that injury to the spinal cord initiates processes which favor regeneration of the function. The dCMS procedure likely synchronizes and facilitates these processes, promoting recovery.",
                                "Before the dCMS application, the spontaneous activity of motoneurons in animals with SCI was higher than that of control animals. This and the exaggerated evoked spinal responses in animals with SCI, is consistent with the behavioral measurements that show spastic syndrome-like characteristics. The exaggerated spontaneous firing rate of spinal motoneurons is also consistent with data from motor unit firing in humans and animals after SCI and with results from intracellular recordings from sacrocaudal motoneurons that show sustained and exaggerated firing rate in animals with SCI. See, for example, Gorassini M., Bennett D. J., Kiehn O., Eken T., Hultborn H., Activation patterns of hindlimb motor units in the awake rate and their relation to motoneuron intrinsic properties, J. NeuroPhysiol. 82:709-717 (1999); Thomas C. K., Ross B. H., Distinct patterns of motor unit behavior during muscle spasms in spinal cord injured subjects, J. NeuroPhysiol. 77:2847-2850 (1997); Harvey J. P., Gorassini M., Bennett D. J., The spastic rat with sacral spinal cord injury in Animal model of movement disorders, edited by Mark LeDoux, El Sevier Academic Press, 691-697 (2005). Minutes after dCMS, motoneuronal spontaneous activity was still substantially increased. Some of these activities were coordinated, as shown in FIG. 3B, although most of the spontaneous activity was in un-modulated pattern of firing as shown in FIG. 9A. Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) that strengthen synaptic inputs in normal behavior depend on descending brain-stem-released serotonin (5-HT) or noradrenaline. Here the increase in the spontaneous firing rate and the appearance of modulated activity in some animals after dCMS may indicate better connections with brain-stem centers."

                                "The application of dCMS on humans yielded similar results. A fourteen year old male with history of erb's palsy (right upper limb) had very weak external rotator muscles of the shoulder. The patient had no voluntary control over these muscles and could not rotate the shoulder outward. In addition, the shoulder external rotators were apparently moderately atrophied, which was determined by clinical observation. The dCMS was applied by situating the first point negative electrode on the muscles belly (the right supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles) and the second point positive electrode on the contralateral muscles (same group). The current passed in between the two locations on opposite sides of the body, forcing the current to cross the spinal cord. It is assumed that the current follows the least resistant pathway which most likely involved right muscles (supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles), the nerves innervating these muscles (the right suprascapular nerve from C5, C6), the motor center in the spinal cord, the nerve innervating contralateral muscles (the left suprascapular nerve from C5, C6) and finally the contralateral muscles (the left supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles), themselves. After only 15 pulses the patient was able to rotate, with ease, the right shoulder externally, and the patient had sensation in the arm during movement. The patient's movement, which was gained during this treatment, persisted for at least four weeks.",
                                "A 14 year old female with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy was also treated with dCMS. She had significant muscle weakness throughout the four extremities and trunk. She also had spasticity and rigidity of most of her joints, especially the distal ones. She had extreme difficulty walking, especially climbing up and down stairs. A similar application of dCMS was performed on this patient. The locations of the electrodes were varied: 1) a positive electrode was situated on the right fibular nerve and a negative electrode on the left fibular nerve. 2) a positive electrode on the right fibular nerve and a negative electrode on the left median nerve. 3) a positive electrode on the left fibular nerve and a negative electrode on the right median nerve. 4) a positive electrode on the right median nerve and a negative electrode on the left median nerve. These configurations all allowed the current to travel across the spinal cord. After 6 sessions of the dipolar stimulation spread into two weeks (30 minutes/session), the patient could climb 17 steps independently.",
                                "The above results clearly show that dCMS is an effective method that enhances the excitability of the cortico-muscular connections in both animals and humans. Thus, the method of the present disclosure can be used in humans suffering after spinal cord injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and others. For example, the method of the present disclosure can be employed to strengthen or awaken any weak or dormant pathway in the nervous system as demonstrated in clinical trials."

A pre-test of cortical stimulation consisting of 10 pulses delivered at 1 Hz (intensity, 5.5 mA; pulse duration, 1 ms) was used to elicit TS muscle twitches. The intensity of anodal tsDC was increased in 30-s steps (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 mA) over a total duration of 3 min. Thus, the maximal current density was 3.75 A/m2 (0.003 A/0.008 m2). To avoid a stimulation break effect, the current intensity was ramped for 10 s. During each tsDC step, a test (identical to the pre-test) was conducted; this test was repeated immediately (about 10 s) after termination of tsDC, and then again 5 and 20 min later. To avoid complications by excitability changes resulting from current applications, each a-tsDC and c-tsDC protocol was tested in different group of animals (n=5/group).",

Repeated measures ANOVA, combined with post hoc tests, showed that a-tsDC affects the ability of the motor cortex to elicit TS twitches (p<0.001). Examples are shown in FIG. 16A.

As shown in FIG. 16D, the average baseline TS twitch peak force was 0.53\u00b10.04, which was enhanced to 1.23\u00b10.08 g, 1.98\u00b10.13 g, 2.88\u00b10.13 g, 4.35\u00b10.14 g, and 5.28\u00b10.17 g at \u22121 mA, \u22121.5 mA, \u22122 mA, \u22122.5 mA, and \u22123 mA, respectively.

Taken together with the a-tsDC results, these data indicate that trans-spinal application of direct current can modulate the ability of the motor cortex to elicit activity at the level of the lumbar spine.

However, the mean latency was calculated based on measurements at all time points following tsDC. For a-tsDC, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (baseline, during, and after stimulation), as shown in FIG. 17A. Post hoc tests revealed that the latency of cortically-elicited tibial nerve potentials was significantly longer during +2 mA stimulation (21.5\u00b10.34 ms) and shorter after termination (17.92\u00b10.21 ms) relative to baseline (19.82\u00b10.17 ms).

                        "Histological analysis demonstrated no harmful morphological effects of the tsDC parameters used in the present study. The maximal current density used was 3.75 A/m2 for a duration of 3 min, which is much lower than the range typically used in rats and mice as known in the art. In this study, spinal cord stimulation differed from cranial stimulation in three respects: (1) the distance from the electrode surface to the ventral aspect of the spinal cord was \u02dc7 mm, as opposed to the distance to the cranium of \u22120.3 mm; (2) bone, muscle and fat tissue was present between the electrode and spinal cord, while only bone was present at the cranium; and (3) the volume of the conductor surrounding the target tissue was much larger in the spinal cord than in the brain, potentially deforming the current and reducing its density.",
                        "Both a- and c-tsDC markedly increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous tibial nerve activity in an intensity-dependent fashion. Interestingly, a-tsDC was more effective than c-tsDC in increasing firing frequency and recruiting units with larger amplitude. These results are in agreement with data from a-tsDC stimulation of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal slices, and cerebellum. The effects of c-tsDC on neuronal discharges were more complex in three respects. First, c-tsDC only caused significant changes at higher intensities (\u22122 and \u22123 mA). Second, c-tsDC did not cause firing of neurons with large spikes, but was observed in some experiments to inhibit firing of large spikes (1 mV), while increasing firing of smaller spikes. Third, as seen in FIG. 14B, c-tsDC evoked rhythmic firing. The c-tsDC-induced increase in firing rate supports previous observations in which negative currents occasionally increased firing rate. See Bindman L. J., Lippold O. C., and Redfearn J. W., The action of brief polarizing currents on the cerebral cortex of the rat (1) during current flow and (2) in the production of long-lasting after-effects, J. Physiol. 172: 369-382 (1964).",
                        "During stimulation, a-tsDC depressed cortically-elicited TS twitches, while c-tsDC markedly potentiated twitches. From immediately after termination of tsDC until at least 20 min later, cortically-elicited TS twitches were markedly potentiated after a-tsDC and depressed after c-tsDC. Moreover, while a-tsDC increased the latency of cortically-elicited tibial nerve potentials, c-tsDC decreased this latency. After a-tsDC or c-tsDC stimulation was terminated, the effect on latency was reversed.",
                        "Changes in latency were observed despite a steady intensity of cortical stimulation, suggesting that factors underlying these changes are not likely to include the switch from a cortical site of activation to a deeper location (Rothwell et al. 1994). Instead, these factors may include: (1) axonal hyperpolarization (Moore and Westerfield 1983) by c-tsDC or (2) activating preferential spinal circuits that mediate corticomotoneuronal transmission. In rodents, the corticomotoneuronal pathway has two indirect routes, a faster route mediated via reticulospinal neurons and a slower route mediated via segmental interneurons. The present findings suggest that c-tsDC may shift the pattern of excitability at the spinal cord toward the faster reticulospinal route. Interestingly, pairing a-tsDC with rCES (1 Hz) potentiated cortically-elicited TS twitches, but was not different from a-tsDC alone. Conversely, pairing c-tsDC with rCES potentiated cortically-elicited TS twitches and had the greatest effects of any stimulation condition.",
                        "The differences in the effects of a-tsDC and c-tsDC on neuronal activity suggest that the two conditions affect distinctive neuronal types through different mechanisms. The topography of spinal neurons relative to the direction of current determines the current locus and type of effect (i.e., increase or decrease in excitability). As illustrated in FIG. 19, a dorsal cathodal current should depolarize neuronal compartments closer to the electrode and hyperpolarize compartments farther from the electrode. Thus, an interneuron with its dendrites and soma at the ventral aspect of the spinal cord and its axon at the dorsal aspect would have a hyperpolarized dendritic tree and soma and a depolarized axon and nerve terminal. Such a neuron would be less responsive to synaptic activation, but would have a lower threshold to spontaneously fire an axonally-generated action potential. A spinal neuron oriented in the opposite direction would show an opposite response to cathodal stimulation. This argument is supported by the finding that motoneuron responses to dorsolateral and medial funiculus stimulation were facilitated by depolarizing currents in the dendrites and soma, but were not affected by hyperpolarizing currents, which have also been shown to occur in the hippocampus (Bikson 2004). See Delgado-Lezama R., Perrier J. F., and Hounsgaard J., Local facilitation of plateau potentials in dendrites of turtle motoneurones by synaptic activation of metabotropic receptors, J. Physiol. 515 (Pt 1): 203-207 (1999) and Bikson M., Effects of uniform extracellular DC electric fields on excitability in rat hippocampal slices in vitro, J. Physiol. 557: 175-190 (2004).",
                        "Presynaptic depolarization has been shown to decrease presynaptic nerve action potentials and EPSPs. See Hubbard J. I. and Willis W. D., The effects of depolarization of motor nerve terminals upon the release of transmitter by nerve impulses, J. Physiol. 194: 381-405 (1968); Hubbard J. I. and Willis W. D., Reduction of transmitter output by depolarization, Nature 193: 1294-1295 (1962). The decrease in the presynaptic nerve action potentials and EPSPs may play a role in depressing cortically-elicited TS twitches during a-tsDC. In addition, hyperpolarization of the soma and dendrites could depress motoneuron responses to cortical stimulation during a-tsDC. Alternative explanations could include: (1) increased numbers of refractory motor neurons due to increased spontaneous firing, or (2) preferential activation of the spinal or supraspinal inhibitory pathway.",
                        "Rhythmic activity was observed during c-tsDC but not a-tsDC, indicating that c-tsDC may have a depressive effect on spinal inhibitory interneurons. Such interneurons might be inhibited because of their topography relative to the applied electrical field. C-tsDC might hyperpolarize both excitatory and inhibitory spinal interneurons. If it is assumed that inhibitory and excitatory spinal interneurons contain different membrane channels (e.g., fewer low-voltage-activated T-type calcium channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation channels in inhibitory interneurons), then hyperpolarization would silence inhibitory interneurons, hence disinhibiting the excitatory interneurons. In contrast, in spinal rhythmogenic neurons, hyperpolarizing tsDC might activate the hyperpolarization-activated, nonselective cation current (Ih). In combination with T-type Ca channels, Ih should gradually depolarize the cell membrane to reach the threshold for an action potential, which could be another mechanism mediating c-tsDC-induced potentiation of cortically-elicited TS twitches.",
                        "Moreover, cathodal stimulation has been shown to increase the excitability of axons aligned perpendicular to the direction of current. See Ardolino G., Bossi B., Barbieri S., and Priori A., Non-synaptic mechanisms underlie the after-effects of cathodal transcutaneous direct current stimulation of the human brain, J. Physiol. 568: 653-663 (2005). Therefore, in the present study, the corticospinal tract, which passes below the cathodal electrode, would be expected to increase axonal excitability and hence spinal output. Conversely, the dendrites and soma of motoneurons would be hyperpolarized and axons would be depolarized in response to a-tsDC stimulation. Axonal depolarization at locations that affect voltage-sensitive membrane conductances could increase the firing rate and amplitude of spontaneous activity during a-tsDC.",
                        "In the spinal cord, L-type Ca+2 channels present in motoneuron dendrites mediate the facilitatory action of depolarizing currents. However, the exact cellular mechanisms mediating DC stimulation after-effects are not clear. Notably, mechanisms mediating the depressive after-effects of cathodal DC stimulation are completely unknown. We suggest that the pattern of c-tsDC-induced polarization (e.g., pre-synaptic hyperpolarization and post-synaptic depolarization) might activate depression-mediating mechanisms, such as retrograde signaling by endocannabinoids that selectively depresses inhibitory pre-synaptic terminals",
