# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present application belongs to the field of immunology and relates to a chimeric antigen receptor for recognizing an Fc fragment and an application thereof, in particular, to a chimeric antigen receptor for recognizing an Fc fragment, a T cell expressing the chimeric antigen receptor, a preparation method therefor and an application thereof in the preparation of a tumor therapeutic drug.

## BACKGROUND

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, referred to as CAR-T, refer to the technology that the variable region of an immunoglobulin and the constant region of a T-cell receptor (TCR) are fused by genetic engineering and expressed on T cells so that T cells can recognize specific antigens and be activated. Up to now, the CAR-T technology can be roughly divided into three generations. In the first-generation CAR-T technology, a single-chain antibody is linked with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM, which is an important component responsible for intracellular signal transduction) of a CD3ζ chain through a transmembrane region. In the second-generation CAR-T technology, on the basis of the first-generation CAR-T, the intracellular domain of a co-stimulatory molecule such as CD28 or 4-1BB is introduced into the ITAM. In the third-generation CAR-T technology, intracellular domains of several co-stimulatory molecules are introduced into the ITAM. The above modifications in CAR molecules mainly focus on the signal transduction region of the intracellular domain.

In recent years, a new design scheme for CAR-T cells has emerged. For example, there are SUPRA-CAR-T cells designed by Wilson W. Wong et al., in which the extracellular domain of a conventional CAR molecule is split into two Zip fragments that can combine with each other, one Zip fragment is fixed on T cells, and the other Zip fragment is free outside T cells, so that the same CAR-T cells can recognize different antigens by changing the free Zip fragment, the activation intensity of T cells can be regulated by changing the type and combination of the free Zip fragment, and there are selection functions of “AND”, “OR” and “NOT” for the recognition of various antigens. However, the structure of such CAR-T cells is very complex, the antibody matching these CAR-T cells is still not available on the market and is still in the clinical trial stage, and its safety needs to be evaluated. The extracellular domain of the conventional CAR molecule is mostly derived from the scFv segment of a xenogeneic antibody, has certain immunogenicity and can be cleared by immune cells, which is not conducive to the long-term survival of CAR-T cells in vivo.

It has been found that immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment can function by mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in many links of monoclonal antibody killing tumor cells. The ADCC refers to the mechanism that natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and neutrophils expressing IgG Fc receptors kill target cells by binding to the Fc segment of the IgG antibody that has already bound to the surface of the target cells such as virus-infected cells or tumor cells, among which the NK cells are the main cells that achieve the ADCC effect. In the process of antibody-mediated ADCC, antibodies only specifically bind to the corresponding epitopes on target cells, and the NK cells and other effector cells can kill any target cells that bind to antibodies. The ADCC has been proved to be an important mechanism and means of monoclonal antibodies in clinical treatment of tumors, and the monoclonal antibodies that have been put into clinical application are: rituximab monoclonal antibody and novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab monoclonal antibody, cetuximab monoclonal antibody, edrecolomab monoclonal antibody, nimotuzumab monoclonal antibody and gemtuzumab ozogamicin monoclonal antibody, all of which have the ADCC anti-tumor effect.

Therefore, in order to further improve the killing effect of CAR-T cells on the tumor, reduce the immunogenicity of CAR molecules and prolong the circulation time of CAR-T cells in vivo, it is necessary to further modify CAR molecules.

  filter to obtain the recombinant lentivirus.

### Example 3 Preparation of CAR-T Cells

- (1) After Pan T cells were isolated from cord blood, the cells were
  counted, and the concentration was adjusted to × 10⁶ cells/mL. Then 10
  µL of TransAct T cell reagent from Miltenyi was added to each
  milliliter of cell suspension, and after 48 hours of activation, the
  medium was changed to a fresh medium (IMDM medium+5% FBS (fetal bovine
  serum) +1% double antibody (100×penicillin-streptomycin mixed
  solution)+IL-2).
- (2) 3 × 10⁷ activated T cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes
  and suspended in 3 mL of medium (IMDM medium+5% FBS (fetal bovine
  serum)+1% double antibody (100×penicillin-streptomycin mixed
  solution)).
- (3) mL of T cell suspension was inoculated in a 6-well plate, 1 mL per
  well.
- (4) The packed recombinant lentivirus was added to the 6-well plate, 9
  mL per well.
- (5) 10 µL of polybrene was added to each well.
- (6) After 8 hours of culture, the medium was changed to 1 mL of fresh
  medium (IMDM medium+10% FBS (fetal bovine serum)+1% double antibody
  (100×penicillin-streptomycin mixed solution)), and 9 mL of recombinant
  lentivirus was added.
- (7) 10 µL of polybrene was added to each well.
- (8) After 5 hours, the virus was removed, and the medium was changed
  to 4 mL of fresh medium (IMDM medium+10% FBS (fetal bovine serum)+1%
  double antibody (100×penicillin-streptomycin mixed solution)).
- (9) After 48 hours, 200 µL of cell suspension was taken for flow
  cytometry to confirm the transduction efficiency.

Results are shown in FIG. 2 which is the flow cytometry result diagram of wild-type T cells (NC-T), CD64-Linker region-free CAR-T cells and CD64-Linker region-based CAR-T cells, which shows that the CAR molecules were highly expressed on the surface of T cells.

### Example 4 Antitumor Effect of CAR-T Cells in vitro

- (1) The wild-type T cells (NC-T), CD64-Linker region-free CAR-T cells,
  CD64-Linker region-based CAR-T cells and SKBR3 cells (breast cancer
  cell line) expressing luciferase were counted, respectively.
- (2) The required number of T cells was calculated according to the
  transduction efficiency, and the ratio was adjusted with wild-type T
  cells (NC-T).
- (3) 100 µL of medium was added to a 96-well plate, then 100 µL of T
  cell suspension was added to the 96-well plate, with replicates per
  group, and then gradient dilution was performed (the ratio of initial
  T cells to tumor cells (E:T) was 2:1).
- (4) 50 µL of tumor cells with a density of 1 × 10⁴ cells/µL was added
  to each well.
- (5) A certain amount of trastuzumab was added to each well.
- (6) After 24 hours, the luciferase was diluted to the working
  concentration and added to the 96-well plate according to the amount
  of 100 µL/well.
- (7) Reading was performed with a microplate reader.

As shown in FIG. 3A, the killing effect of wild-type T cells (NC-T) and CAR-T cells on SKBR3 cells was not significant under the condition of not cooperating with trastuzumab. As shown in FIG. 3B, when CAR-T cells cooperated with trastuzumab, Linker region-based CAR-T cells had high tumor-killing activity while the killing effect of Linker region-free CAT-T cells is not significant, and the reason is that the existence of the Linker region ensured that the Fcγ receptor extracellular domain which was used the antigen binding domain could be fully exposed to the surface of T cell membrane and improved the binding ability of the CAR-T cells to the antibody Fc segment so that the CAR-T cells could achieve an ADCC effect similar to that of natural immune cells such as NK cells and achieve an efficient killing effect on tumor cells.

### Example 5 Antitumor Effect of CAR-T Cells in vivo

- (1) SKOV3 cells were counted, the cell density was adjusted to 1×10⁷
  /mL with normal saline, and 100 µL of SKOV3 cell suspension was
  injected into the right groin of an immunodeficient mouse via
  subcutaneous injection. After 30 days of culture, SKOV3 tumor-bearing
  mouse model was obtained.
- (2) T cells (MOCK-T) in a negative control group, T cells in a
  positive control group and CD64 CAR-T cells were counted,
  respectively.
- (3) The required number of T cells was calculated according to the
  transduction efficiency, and the CAR-T cell ratio was adjusted to
  30%-40% with T cells (MOCK-T) in the negative control group.
- (4) The cell concentration of each group was adjusted to 1 × 10⁸ /mL
  with normal saline.
- (5) 1 × 10⁷ cells were injected into the tail vein of each mouse.
- (6) The tumor size of mice was recorded every 3 days, and the mice
  were sacrificed on Day 22. The tumor was dissected and retrieved, and
  the tumor weight was weighed.

As shown in FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C, CD64 CAR-T cells had no significant killing effect on tumors formed by SKOV3 under the condition of not cooperating with trastuzumab while CD64 CAR-T cells had a good clearance effect on tumors formed by SKOV3 under the condition of cooperating.

To sum up, in the present application, the Fcγ receptor extracellular domain is used as the antigen binding domain of the chimeric antigen receptor so that the prepared CAR-T cell can recognize the Fc fragment of an antibody, achieve, when used in combination with a tumor therapeutic antibody, an ADCC effect similar to that of natural immune cells such as NK cells, and achieve an efficient killing effect on the tumor cells. The antigen binding domain of the chimeric antigen receptor is a human Fcγ receptor extracellular domain that basically has no immunogenicity so that the CAR-T cell has high safety and long circulation time in vivo. A Linker region is added between the antigen binding domain and the transmembrane domain of the chimeric antigen receptor, improving the binding ability of CAR-T cells to the antibody Fc segment. The chimeric antigen receptor of the present application has the advantages of simple design and simple structure and has no restriction on the types of antibodies used in combination, which is beneficial to achieving industrial application. with trastuzumab.
