    "abstract": "A chimeric antigen receptor for recognizing an Fc fragment and an application thereof. The chimeric antigen receptor comprises an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular costimulatory signal transduction domain. The antigen binding domain comprises an Fc\u03b3 receptor extracellular domain. According to the present invention, the Fc\u03b3 receptor extracellular domain is used as the antigen binding domain of the chimeric antigen receptor, so that the prepared CAR-T cell can recognize the Fc fragment of an antibody, and achieve, when used in combination with a tumor therapeutic antibody containing an IgG1 or IgG3 Fc fragment, an ADCC effect similar to that of natural immune cells such as NK cells; even in the case that antigen loss occurs in tumor cells, the CAR-T can also be used in combination with an antibody for recognizing another target to achieve an efficient killing effect on the tumor cells.",

                        "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, referred to as CAR-T, refer to the technology that the variable region of an immunoglobulin and the constant region of a T-cell receptor (TCR) are fused by genetic engineering and expressed on T cells so that T cells can recognize specific antigens and be activated. Up to now, the CAR-T technology can be roughly divided into three generations. In the first-generation CAR-T technology, a single-chain antibody is linked with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM, which is an important component responsible for intracellular signal transduction) of a CD3\u03b6 chain through a transmembrane region. In the second-generation CAR-T technology, on the basis of the first-generation CAR-T, the intracellular domain of a co-stimulatory molecule such as CD28 or 4-1BB is introduced into the ITAM. In the third-generation CAR-T technology, intracellular domains of several co-stimulatory molecules are introduced into the ITAM. The above modifications in CAR molecules mainly focus on the signal transduction region of the intracellular domain.",
                        "In recent years, a new design scheme for CAR-T cells has emerged. For example, there are SUPRA-CAR-T cells designed by Wilson W. Wong et al., in which the extracellular domain of a conventional CAR molecule is split into two Zip fragments that can combine with each other, one Zip fragment is fixed on T cells, and the other Zip fragment is free outside T cells, so that the same CAR-T cells can recognize different antigens by changing the free Zip fragment, the activation intensity of T cells can be regulated by changing the type and combination of the free Zip fragment, and there are selection functions of \u201cAND\u201d, \u201cOR\u201d and \u201cNOT\u201d for the recognition of various antigens. However, the structure of such CAR-T cells is very complex, the antibody matching these CAR-T cells is still not available on the market and is still in the clinical trial stage, and its safety needs to be evaluated. The extracellular domain of the conventional CAR molecule is mostly derived from the scFv segment of a xenogeneic antibody, has certain immunogenicity and can be cleared by immune cells, which is not conducive to the long-term survival of CAR-T cells in vivo.",
                        "It has been found that immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment can function by mediating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in many links of monoclonal antibody killing tumor cells. The ADCC refers to the mechanism that natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and neutrophils expressing IgG Fc receptors kill target cells by binding to the Fc segment of the IgG antibody that has already bound to the surface of the target cells such as virus-infected cells or tumor cells, among which the NK cells are the main cells that achieve the ADCC effect. In the process of antibody-mediated ADCC, antibodies only specifically bind to the corresponding epitopes on target cells, and the NK cells and other effector cells can kill any target cells that bind to antibodies. The ADCC has been proved to be an important mechanism and means of monoclonal antibodies in clinical treatment of tumors, and the monoclonal antibodies that have been put into clinical application are: rituximab monoclonal antibody and novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab monoclonal antibody, cetuximab monoclonal antibody, edrecolomab monoclonal antibody, nimotuzumab monoclonal antibody and gemtuzumab ozogamicin monoclonal antibody, all of which have the ADCC anti-tumor effect.",
                        "Therefore, in order to further improve the killing effect of CAR-T cells on the tumor, reduce the immunogenicity of CAR molecules and prolong the circulation time of CAR-T cells in vivo, it is necessary to further modify CAR molecules."
