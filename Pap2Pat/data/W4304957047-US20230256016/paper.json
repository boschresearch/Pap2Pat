    "abstract": "Co-expression of chimeric switch receptors (CSRs) specific for PD-L1 improves the antitumor effects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. However, the effects of trans-recognition between CSRs and PD-L1 expressed by activated CAR T cells remain unclear. Here, we design a CSR specific for PD-L1 (CARP), containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD28 but not the CD3 \u03b6 chain. We show that CARP T cells enhance the antitumor activity of anti-mesothelin CAR (CARMz) T cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, confocal microscopy indicates that PD-L1 molecules on CARMz T cells accumulate at cell-cell contacts with CARP T cells. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, we reveal that CARP T cells promote CARMz T cells differentiation into central memory-like T cells, upregulate genes related to Th1 cells, and downregulate Th2-associated cytokines through the CD70-CD27 axis. Moreover, these effects are not restricted to PD-L1, as CAR19 T cells expressing anti-CD19 CSR exhibit similar effects on anti-PSCA CAR T cells with truncated CD19 expression. These findings suggest that target trans-recognition by CSRs on CAR T cells may improve the efficacy and persistence of CAR T cells via the CD70-CD27 axis.",

                "The programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis is considered one of the most important immunosuppressive signaling pathways for tumor evasion1. The PD-1 receptor is expressed at very low levels in resting T cells, but its expression can be induced following T cell activation and is also observed on activated B cells and myeloid cells2. Currently, two PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) have been identified. PD-L1 upregulation is detected in multiple solid tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated that PD-L1 expression on cancer cells mediates an immunosuppressive function through its interaction with PD-1 on T cells, ultimately resulting in T cell exhaustion, whereas PD-L2 expression is restricted mainly to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages3\u20135. To date, various types of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been approved for the treatment of several tumors, and durable tumor control and acceptable safety profiles have been achieved6,7.",
                "CD70 is transiently upregulated on activated T cells, while its receptor, CD27, is physiologically expressed on T cells8. CD27/CD70 costimulation enhances T cell proliferation and survival and promotes na\u00efve T cell differentiation into antigen-specific cytotoxic and memory T cells9\u201311. The CD70-CD27 axis also promotes Th1 cell differentiation12. Th1 cells produce abundant proinflammatory cytokines, including IL2, IF\u039d-\u03b3, and TNF. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL5, IL10, and IL13, are secreted by Th2 cells13,14. Varlilumab, a CD27 agonistic antibody, shows promising efficacy in multiple cancer types15.",
                "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promising efficacy in the clinical management of B cell-derived malignancies, but not in solid tumors16. One of challenges of CAR T cell therapy against solid tumor is its poor persistence17. PD-L1 expression on solid tumors may be responsible for the poor efficacy of CAR T cells. To convert the inhibitory signaling initiated by PD-L1 into a stimulatory one, several groups co-expressed chimeric switch receptors (CSRs) targeting PD-L1 in CAR T cells and found that these CSRs augment the antitumor effects of CAR T cells18,19. Notably, PD-L1 is also expressed in activated T cells20\u201322. However, the effect of trans-recognition between CSRs and PD-L1 in activated CAR T cells on antitumor activity of CAR T cells remain to be investigated.",
                "Here, to examine the effects of the trans-recognition between CSRs and PD-L1 on CAR T cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, we design a CSR targeting PD-L1 containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD28, without the CD3\u03b6 chain (CARP). T cells overexpressing CARP improve the antitumor activity of anti-mesothelin (MSLN) CAR (CARMz) T cells in vitro and in vivo and promote them differentiation into central memory-like T cells. In addition, these effects are not restricted to any specific antigens that the CSR recognize but depend on the ligation between CD27 on CARMz T cells and CD70 on CARP T cells. These findings suggest that the trans-recognition between CSR and target antigen on CAR T cells may enhance the antitumor activity and promote central memory-like CAR T cells formation via the CD70-CD27 axis."

                        "A previous study demonstrated that coexpression of a CSR targeting PD-L1 (PD1CD28) augment the antitumor effects of CAR T cells18,19. As CAR T cells upregulate PD-L1 expression upon CAR activation20,22, it remains unclear whether PD1CD28-expressing T cells can interact with antigen-stimulated CAR T cells and regulate the antitumor effects of the CAR T cells. To answer this question, we designed a CAR vector targeting PD-L1, referred to as CARP, consisting of a scFv against human PD-L1 (3208)23, an intracellular domain that contained only the CD28 costimulatory domain without the CD3\u03b6 chain, and a truncated CD19 (tCD19) tag, and a CAR vector targeting MSLN, named CARMz, containing a scFv against human MSLN (SS1)24, the CD28 costimulatory domain, the CD3\u03b6 chain, and a GFP tag. CAR19z, which contains a FMC63 scFv25, the CD28 costimulatory domain and the CD3\u03b6 chain, served as a negative control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). We transduced these CAR vectors individually into T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). CARP T cells were cocultured with K562-PDL1-GL cells, a leukemia cell line that was negative for MHC-I molecules and engineered to express PDL1-GL, a vector containing PD-L1, GFP and luciferase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a, b)26. We found that the percentage of CD25+CD69+ cells in CARP T cells and the amount of IL2 and IFN-\u03b3 produced by CARP T cells were increased in the co-culture, compared with those of CAR19z T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, d). However, CARP T cells did not lyse K562-PDL1-GL cells as it is also observed with the control CAR19z cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e). These results show that CARP T cells could be activated by tumor target cells expressing PD-L1 but did not lyse them in vitro. In contrast, CARMz T cells efficiently lysed HeLa-GL cells, a cervical cancer cell line that spontaneously expresses MSLN but not PD-L1, and was engineered to express GFP and luciferase (GL) (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02a, 3a\u2013c). In line with previous studies20, CARMz T cells exhibited upregulated PD-L1 at 16\u2009h post-coculture with HeLa-GL cells but its expression attenuated at 48\u2009h post-coculture (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d, e).",
                        "To study the interaction between CARP T and CARMz T cells, we then mixed them at a ratio of 1:1 and cocultured them with HeLa-GL cells. We found that the mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells lysed HeLa-GL cells more efficiently than CARMz T cells alone, while CARP T cells alone were unable to lyse these target cells (Fig.\u00a01a). In addition, the mixed CAR T cells secreted significantly more antitumor cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3, than CARMz T cells alone, while CARP T cells alone had only a modest production IFN-\u03b3 (Fig.\u00a01b). Similarly, the mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells lysed H460-MSLN-GL cells, a lung cancer cell line that highly expresses both MSLN and PD-L1 (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02a, 4a), more efficiently and secreted more IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 than separated cultures of CARMz T cells, while CARP T cells only had mild killing activity to target cells and produced very minimal amounts of cytokines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b, c). Interestingly, CARP T cells enhanced the killing capacity of CARMz T cells not through secreting IL-2 or IFN-\u03b3, as the mixed CAR T cells still exhibited augmented cytotoxicity in the presence of anti-IL2 or anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibodies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d).Fig. 1CARP T cells enhance the antitumor efficacy of CARMz T cells.a CARP T, CARMz T, a mixture of CARMz T and CARP T and control CAR19z T cells cytotoxicity against HeLa-GL cells were measured at various E:T ratios.

                        "We next compared the antitumor effects of a combination of CARMz T and CARP T to CARMz T cells alone in vivo. In mice bearing HeLa-GL xenografts, both the tumor volumes and weights of the combination group were lower than those of the CARMz T cell group (Fig.\u00a01c, d). Of interest, we found that CARMz T cells in the tumors from the combination group exhibited phenotypes of central memory T cells (Tcm, CD45RO+, CCR7+) and stem cell memory T cells (Tscm, CD45RO\u2212, CCR7+), while CARMz T cells in the tumors from the separated CARMz T cell group were mainly effector T cells (CD45RO\u2212, CCR7\u2212) and effector memory T cells (CD45RO+, CCR7\u2212) (Fig.\u00a01e, f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a). Similar results were obtained when we increased the doses of CAR T cells from 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 per mouse to 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 per mouse (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b). We also assessed the antitumor activity of the combination of CARMz T and CARP T cells in a PD-L1+MSLN+ NSCLC PDX mouse model (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). In line with the results in HeLa-GL xenografts, the tumors in the combination group were significantly smaller and lighter than those in the CARMz T cell and CARP T cell groups (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d, e). Altogether, these results show that the combination of CARP T and CARMz T cells was more efficient in repressing tumor growth than CARMz T cells alone. In addition, CARP T cells might promote memory T cell formation in CARMz T cells, as tumor-infiltrated CARMz T cells from the combination group contained central memory-like T cells."

We cocultured CARMz T cells with HeLa-GL cells with or without AZ and found that AZ did not enhance the killing capacity of CARMz T cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Similarly, anti-PD-1 mAb, pembrolizumab, did not elevate the lysing capacity of CARMz T cells against HeLa-GL cells (Fig.\u00a02b).

Interestingly, treatment of CARMz T cells with AZ did reduce the tumor-lysing capacity of the mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells (Fig.\u00a02c), suggesting that CARP T cells augmented cytotoxicity of CARMz T cells possibly through physical interactions between PD-L1 on CARMz T cells and CSR on CARP T cells (Fig.\u00a02d).Fig. 2Formation of cell\u2013cell connections between CARMz T and CARP T cells.a CARMz T and CAR19z T cells with or without an anti-PD-L1 mAb (AZ, 20\u2009\u03bcg/ml) against HeLa-GL cells were measured at various E:T ratios. p Values (CAR19z T vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20097.499E\u221210, CARMz T\u2009+\u2009AZ vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20090.164). b CARMz T and CAR19z T cells with or without an anti-PD-1 mAb (P, 20\u2009\u03bcg/ml) against HeLa-GL cells were measured at various E:T ratios. p Values (CAR19z T vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20095E\u221214, CARMz T\u2009+\u2009P vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20090.084). c CARMz T, CARP T, a mixture of CARMz T and CARP T, a mixture of CARMz T and CARP T treated with anti-PD-L1 mAb (AZ, 20\u2009\u03bcg/ml) and control CAR19z T cells against HeLa-GL cells were measured at various E:T ratios. p Values (CAR19z T vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20093.309E\u221207, CARMz T\u2009+\u2009CARP T vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20090.001, CARMz T\u2009+\u2009CARP T\u2009+\u2009AZ vs. CARMz T\u2009=\u20090.939).

In particular, PD-L1 molecules on CARMz T cells that expressed GFP concentrated at the junctions between CARMz T and CARP T cells (Fig.\u00a02e).

There were 374 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 276 downregulated DEGs in mCARMz T cells compared to sCARMz T cells (Fig.\u00a03b), suggesting that the transcriptomic profiles of CARMz T cells changed dramatically after coculture with CARP T cells. Conversely, there were only 1 upregulated DEGs and 11 downregulated DEGs in CARMz T cells upon AZ treatment (Fig.\u00a03b). Further analysis with a heatmap shows that mCARMz T cells specifically upregulated genes related to stem cell maintenance (RIF1, IGF1, and KLF4)28\u201330, long-lasting T cell maintenance (IL6ST)31, WNT pathway (WNT10A, WNT10B, WNT16, GIPR, MST1, IRS2, and TCF7L2) and antiapoptotic processes (BCL6, NRN1, and NOL3)32\u201337 compared with sCARMz T cells and AZ-treated CARMz T cells (Fig.\u00a03c).

Cells from the cluster 1 (C1) did not express genes related to T cell activation, proliferation, cytotoxicity, or memory formation, suggesting that they were non-activated T cells (Tua) (Fig.\u00a04d, e). Cells from C2 were CD8+ effector cells (Tef8), as they expressed genes related to effector T cell functions (CCL5, GZMA, PRF1, GNLY, and IFNG)40\u201342 and the AP1 family (JUN) (Fig.\u00a04d, e)43. Cells from C6 highly expressed T cells activation and costimulation associated genes (CD28 and TNFRSF4) and JUN, thus were considered as Tef4 (Fig.\u00a04d, e)43\u201345. Since the cells in C3 and C7 exhibited moderate expression of genes associated with naive T cells (LEF1 and CD27) and effector T cells (GZMA) (Fig.\u00a04d, e)46\u201348, they might represent T cells at an intermediate transition state between the naive and effector states. We defined C3 and C7 as CD8+ and CD4+ partially differentiated effector T cells (Tie8 and Tie4), respectively. Cells from C4, C5, and C8 highly expressed CCR7, CD27, and LEF149\u201351. In addition, cells from C5 also expressed higher levels of CD28 and JUN, compared to cells from C4 (Fig.\u00a04d, e)43,44. Therefore, we named C4 and C8 as CD8+ and CD4+ central memory-like T cells (Tcm8 and Tcm4)52\u201354, respectively, and C5 as CD8+ activated central memory-like T cells (acTcm8).Fig. 4scRNA-seq analysis of individual CARMz T (sCARMz T) and CARMz T from a mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells (mCARMz T) after coculture with HeLa-GL cells.a\u2013h Single cell RNA-seq strategy: Individual CARMz T (sCARMz T) and CARMz T from a combination of CARMz T and CARP T cells (mCARMz T) were separated by flow cytometry sorting based on their GFP tag post-coculture with HeLa-GL cells, and then processed for scRNA-seq. b The UMAP projection of single CARMz T from sCARMz T and mCARMz T cells.

                        "GSEA analysis also indicated that genes that are highly expressed in CD8+ stem cell memory T cells but not in CD8+ naive T cells were enriched in cells from the cluster Tcm8 (Fig.\u00a04f). In addition, genes that are upregulated in CD4+ effector memory T cells, compared to CD4+ central memory T cells were negatively enriched in cells from the cluster Tcm4 (Fig.\u00a04g). Most importantly, the numbers of mCARMz T cells were higher than those of sCARMz T cells in Tcm4 (235 mCARMz T cells vs. 83 sCARMz T cells) and Tcm8 (478 mCARMz T cells vs. 287 sCARMz T cells) (Fig.\u00a04h), suggesting that mCARMz T cells contained more central memory-like T cells than sCARMz T cells. Consistent to scRNA-seq analysis (Fig.\u00a04h), the percentages of CD8+ and CD4+ central memory T cells in mCARMz T cells were higher than those in sCARMz T cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a04i, j and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09c). Taken together, the scRNA-seq results indicate that CARP T cells promoted CARMz T cells to differentiate to central memory-like T cells and Th1 cells."

                        "To study the effects of CARMz T cells on CARP T cells, we sorted CARP T cells (mCARP T cells) from a mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells by flow cytometry based on their tCD19 expression and compared their transcription profiles to separated CARP T cells (sCARP T) using bulk RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). The RNA-seq analysis shows that mCARP T cells slightly upregulated genes related to T cell activation (IL2RA and CD69)55,56, cytotoxicity (TNF, GZMB, and IL2) migration (CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL4)57 and genes in the AP-1 family (FOS and JUN) compared with sCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07b). In line with the RNA-seq results, mCARP T cells exhibited a higher percentage of surface markers associated with T cell activation, such as 4-1BB and CD28, than sCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07c). Thus, these results demonstrated that the activation status of CARP T cells was enhanced once they encountered activated CARMz T cells.",
                        "We also used scRNA-seq to determine the single-cell transcriptional profiles of mCARP T cells and sCARP T cells post-coculture with HeLa-GL cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a). scRNA-seq results were obtained for a total of 3924 individual single cells: 1196 sCARP T cells and 2728 mCARP T cells. We detected a median of 1369 genes and a minimum of at least 229 genes in each cell. Details on scRNA-seq data processing are provided in the methods section. A total of seven distinct clusters (C1\u20137) were identified in UMAP diagram (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07d), with completely different distribution characteristics for sCARP and mCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07e). We also analyzed scRNA-seq data abased on tSNE dimension reduction method and obtained similar cell clustering (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07f, g). Notably, clusters C1, C4, and C7 were mainly composed of sCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07h). In particular, 90% of the cells in C4, 89% of the cells in C1 and 92% of the cells in C7 were sCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07h). In contrast, the majorities of the other clusters (97% of the cells in C5, 98% of the cells in C2, 91% of the cells in C6, 98% of the cells in C3) were mCARP T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07h). Moreover, the cells from clusters C4\u2013C7 were mainly CD4+ T cells, and the cells from C1-C3 were mainly CD8+ (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i). The T cells from clusters C4 and C1 highly expressed TCF7 but expressed IL2RA, TNFRSF4, and CD70 at low levels8, suggesting that they were non-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Tua4 and Tua8), respectively (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i, j). The T cells from clusters C5 and C2 were considered as CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells (Tef4 and Tef8), respectively, as they highly expressed genes related to T cell activation (IL2RA, CD70, TNFRSF4, and JUN) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i, j). In addition, the T cells from C2 highly expressed effector T cell-related genes (GZMA, GZMB, IFNG, and CCL5) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i, j)58. T cells in cluster C7 were classified as CD4+ Th17 T cells (T17), as they highly upregulated the expression of CASP1 and IL26, which are key markers of Th17 T cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i, j)59,60. Since the cells in C6 and C3 exhibited moderate expression of genes associated with naive T cells (TCF7) and effector T cells (FOS, JUN, GZMA, and GZMB)61, they might represent T cells at an intermediate transition state from the naive to effector state (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07i, j). We thus defined C6 and C3 as partially differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells (Tie4 and Tie8), respectively. Taken together, these scRNA-seq analysis results show that mCARP T cells contained higher percentages of effector T cells and partially differentiated effector T cells than sCARP T cells, suggesting that CARMz T cells augmented the activation of CARP T cells."

                        "To dissect how CARP T cells promote CARMz T cells to differentiate to memory T cells, we quantitatively analyzed intercellular communication networks based on scRNA-seq data of CARMz T and CARP T cells by CellChat tool62. As there were more CD4+ and CD8+ central memory-like CARMz T cells (M-Tcm4 and M-Tcm8, respectively) in co-culture with CARP T cells, compared to the culture without CARP T cells (Fig.\u00a04h), we first analyzed potential interactions between the M-Tcm4 cluster with other subsets of CARMz T and CARP T cells, and found that the interaction strengths of the M-Tcm4 cluster with CD8+ effector CARP T cells (the P-Tef8 cluster) and CD8+ non-activated CARP T cells (the P-Tua8 cluster) were stronger than those with other clusters (Fig.\u00a05a and Supplementary Table\u00a01)62. Similarly, the M-Tcm8 cluster interacted strongly with these two clusters from CARP T cells (P-Tef8 and P-Tua8) (Fig.\u00a05b and Supplementary Table\u00a01). To uncover how the P-Tef8 and P-Tua8 clusters affect the M-Tcm4 and M-Tcm8 clusters, we analyzed the outgoing signaling pathways of P-Tef8 and P-Tua8 and the incoming signaling pathways of M-Tcm4 and M-Tcm8. The outgoing patterns revealed how the cells as signal sources coordinated with each other, as well as how they coordinated with certain signaling pathways to drive communication. Incoming patterns showed how the cells as signal receivers coordinated with each other, as well as how they coordinated with certain signaling pathways to respond to incoming signals62. In total, 18 outgoing or incoming signaling pathways were identified, including four incoming signaling pathways that were expressed in M-Tcm4 and M-Tcm8 clusters simultaneously (LT, CD70, ALCAM, and JAM) (Fig.\u00a05c). Within these four incoming signaling pathways, CD27, the corresponding ligand of CD70, was expressed in M-Tcm4 and M-Tcm8 clusters, while only CD70 was expressed in the P-Tef8 cluster (Fig.\u00a05c, d). T cells in the P-Tua8 cluster did not express any corresponding outgoing signaling pathways of LT, CD70, ALCAM, or JAM pathways (Fig.\u00a05c, d). These results indicated that CARP T cells from the P-Tef8 clusters promoted CARMz T cells to differentiate to memory-like T cells through the CD70-CD27 axis.Fig. 5Quantitative analysis of intercellular communication between CARMz T and CARP T cells.a, b The inferred interaction strength of CD4+ central memory CARMz T cells (M-Tcm4) and CD8+ central memory CARMz T cells (M-Tcm8) with other cell clusters from CARMz T and CARP T cells.

To validate whether CARP T cells promote CARMz T cells to differentiate into memory-like T cells through the CD70-CD27 axis, we blocked this axis with anti-CD70 mAb (\u03b1CD70) and found that \u03b1CD70 treatment reduced the percentages of central memory T cells defined as CD45RO+CCR7+ in mCARMz T cells (Fig.\u00a06e, f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a09c). In addition, the tumor lysing capacity of CARMz T cells in the mixture of CARMz T and CARP T cells was compromised upon \u03b1CD70 treatment in vitro (Fig.\u00a06g), suggesting that CARP T cells augmented the cytotoxicity of CARMz T cells through the interaction between CD70 and CD27.

We thus modified the CARP vector by replacing the scFv of 3208 with a scFv of FMC63 targeting CD19 instead of PD-L1. Similar to the CARP vector, the new CSR vector, named as CAR19, contained a CD28 costimulatory domain but not CD3\u03b6 chain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a, c).

In addition, similar phenotypes were also observed when we replaced the anti-PD-L1 CSR with an anti-CD19 CSR that recognized tCD19 on anti-PSCA CAR (CARPAz) T cells. These results suggest that the effects of CSR-T cells on CAR T cells depend on the binding between CSR molecules on CSR-T cells and their antigens on CAR T cells but are not restricted to any specific antigens. Indeed, we observed a direct intercellular contact between CARP T and CARMz T cells. Of note, PD-L1 was polarized in the cell-cell connection, suggesting that this connection is initiated by the recognition between CSR and antigens on CAR T cells. What is the function of the cell-cell contact between CARP T and CARMz T cells? Are there any signaling communications between CSR-T and CAR T cells through the cell-cell connection? Further investigations on the structure and its function are warranted. A recent study shows that homophilic interaction of CD56 on CAR T cells enhances antitumor activity63.

In addition, we found that the CD70-CD27 axis is essential for CARP T cells to promote CARMz T cells to differentiate to central memory-like CARMz T cells. Our results suggest that agonistic CD27 antibodies like varlilumab may improve efficacy of CAR T cells15,50. Further studies are also warranted to identify any additional ligand-receptor interactions that contribute the effects of CARP T cells on CARMz T cells between these two types of cells.",
                "In conclusion, our findings show that CARP T cells bound to CARMz T cells through cell-cell contacts, promoted CARMz T cells to differentiate to central memory-like T cells, and elevated their antitumor activity via the CD70\u2013CD27 axis, indicating an important role of the trans-recognition between CSR and its antigen on CAR T cells in regulating the efficacy and persistence of CAR T cells (Fig.\u00a07f)."
