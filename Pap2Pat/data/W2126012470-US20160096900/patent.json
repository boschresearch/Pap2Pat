Such inhibitors can include, but are not limited to small molecules, antibodies, and aptamers that inhibit activity of QSOX1 protein, and antisense, siRNA, shRNA, etc. that inhibit expression of QSOX1 mRNA and/or protein. Inhibitors of QSOX1 expression may be identified through any suitable means, including but not limited to the methods described below.

In one preferred embodiment, the methods are used to treat any tumor type that over-expresses QSOX1. Expression of QSOX1 can be assessed by any suitable method, including but not limited to immunohistochemistry of suitable tissue sample, polymerase chain reaction, or detection of QSOX1 peptides in suitable tissue, as disclosed, for example, in WO 2010/071788; WO 2010/01787; and WO 2010/077921, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In various non-limiting embodiments, techniques that can be used in the analysis include mass spectrometry (MS), two dimensional gel electrophoresis, western blotting, immunofluorescence, ELISAs, antigen capture assays (including dipstick antigen capture assays) and mass spec immunoassay (MSIA). In one preferred embodiment, ligands for the one or more peptides are used to \u201ccapture\u201d antigens out of the tissue sample. Such ligands may include, but are not limited to, antibodies, antibody fragments and aptamers. In one embodiment, the ligand(s) are immobilized on a surface and the sample is passed over the surface under conditions suitable for binding of any peptides in the sample to the ligand(s) immobilized on the surface. Such antigen capture assays permit determining a concentration of the peptides in the tissue sample, as the concentration likely correlates with extent of disease.",
                        "The tissue sample may be any suitable sample from which tumor-derived peptides may be obtained. In various preferred embodiments, the tissue sample is selected from the group consisting of plasma, serum, urine, saliva, and relevant tumor tissue. In various preferred embodiments for detecting QSOX1 peptides in tissue (preferably plasma or serum), the peptide to be detected is selected from the group consisting of",
                        "As used herein, the phrase \u201can amount effective\u201d refers to the amount of inhibitor that provides a suitable treatment effect.",
                        "Any suitable control can be used to compare with QSOX1 expression and/or activity in the subject's tissue. In one embodiment, the control comprises an amount of one or more peptides of interest from a tissue sample from a normal subject or population (i.e. known not to be suffering from a tumor), or from a subject or population of subjects suffering from a tumor, using the same detection assay. The control tissue sample will be of the same tissue sample type as that assessed from the test subject. In one preferred embodiment, a standard concentration curve of one or more peptides of interest in the control tissue sample is determined, and the amount of the one or more peptides of interest in the test subject's tissue sample is compared based on the standard curve. In another preferred embodiment for use in monitoring progress of tumor therapy, samples are obtained from patients over time, during or after their therapy, to monitor levels of one or more peptides in plasma as an indication about tumor burden in patients. The control may comprise a time course of concentration of the one or more peptides of interest in a given tissue type of the test subject, to monitor the effect of treatment on the concentration; this embodiment is preferred, for example, when assessing efficacy of tumor treatments. Those of skill in the art will recognize that similar controls can be used for immunohistochemical-based analysis. Based on the teachings herein and the knowledge in the art, those of skill in the art can design a variety of other appropriate controls in assessing QSOX1 expression and/or activity in identifying subjects most likely to respond to the treatment methods of the invention, as well as to assess efficacy of the treatment over time.",
                        "Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the method comprises identifying subjects with tumors that over-express QSOX1, and treating such patients according to the methods of the invention. In one preferred embodiment, the method comprises measuring QSOX1 expression in blood plasma to identify tumors that over-express QSOX1. Methods for preparing blood plasma are well known in the art. In one embodiment, plasma is prepared by centrifuging a blood sample under conditions suitable for pelleting of the cellular component of the blood.",
                        "Non-limiting tumor types that can be treated using the methods of the invention include pancreatic, lung, colon, breast, and prostate tumors. In one embodiment, the tumor is a pancreatic tumor, such as a pancreatic adenocarcinoma or a neuroendocrine tumor. In a further embodiment, the tumor comprises a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",
                        "In a further embodiment, the tumor is a breast tumor. In one such embodiment, the breast tumor is an estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor. In another embodiment, the breast tumor is a Luminal B tumor. For example, the Luminal B tumor is ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive (PR+). In another example, the Luminal B tumor is highly positive for Ki67 and/or HER2-positive. In another example, the Luminal B tumor is ER+, PR\u2212, and HER2-positive. In another example, the Luminal B tumor is ER+, PR+, and HER2-positive. In these embodiments, the methods may further comprise treating the patient with one or more of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and treatments targeted to HER2 (including but not limited to pertuzumab, lapatinib, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)).",
                        "As used herein, \u201ctreating tumors\u201d means accomplishing one or more of the following: (a) reducing tumor mass; (b) slowing the increase in tumor mass; (c) reducing size of tumor metastases and/or budding off of metastases; (d) slowing the incidence of tumor metastases; (e) limiting or preventing development of symptoms characteristic of cancer; (f) inhibiting worsening of symptoms characteristic of cancer; (g) limiting or preventing recurrence of symptoms of cancer in subjects that were previously symptomatic; (i) increasing subject survival time; and (j) limiting or reducing morbidity of therapy by enhancing current therapies and/or permitting decreased dose of current standard of care therapies.",
                        "For example, symptoms of pancreatic cancer include, but are not limited to, pain in the upper abdomen, significant weight loss, loss of appetite and/or nausea and vomiting, jaundice, and Trousseau sign. Symptoms of breast cancer include, but are not limited to, a breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue, bloody discharge from the nipple, change in the size or shape of a breast, changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling, inverted nipple, peeling, scaling or flaking of the nipple or breast skin; and redness or pitting of the skin over the breast.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the methods limit tumor metastasis, such as limiting pancreatic or breast tumor metastasis. As shown in the examples that follow, the inventors have shown that knockdown of QSOX1 expression in tumor cells leads to a dramatic decrease in tumor cell invasive/migratory phenotype, thus making the methods of the invention particularly useful for limiting tumor metastasis. Silencing of QSOX1 protein expression with shRNA was shown to inhibit breast tumor growth in vitro, and to suppress breast tumor cell invasion through Matrigel\u2122 (which can be rescued by addition of exogenous recombinant QSOX1).",
                        "While not being limited by any particular mechanism of action, the inventors believe that this inhibition of metastasis may result from a decrease in the proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9), as discussed in more detail in the examples that follow.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment of all of the above embodiments, the inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of antibodies, antisense RNA, siRNA, miRNA, and shRNA. In a further preferred embodiment, the inhibitor comprises or consists of antisense, siRNA, miRNA, and/or shRNA molecules having a nucleic acid sequence perfectly complementary to least 10 contiguous nucleotides of QSOX1 as shown in SEQ ID NO:1 and SEQ ID NO:2 or RNA equivalents thereof; and/or fragments of the nucleic acid molecule. In various preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule is perfectly complementary to at least 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or more contiguous nucleotides of QSOX1, or an RNA equivalent thereof.",
                        "In another preferred embodiment, the inhibitor comprises or consists of a nucleic acid selected from the group consisting of",
                        "wherein residues noted as \u201c(T/U)\u201d can be either \u201cT\u201d or \u201cU\u2019. In further preferred embodiments, the inhibitor comprises or consists of",
                        "In a further preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids of SEQ ID NO:11-22 are part of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA). In this embodiment, such an shRNA comprises flanking regions, loops, and antisense and spacer sequences flanking a recited SEQ ID NO: sequence responsible for the specificity of shRNA. There are no specific sequence requirements for these various other shRNA regions so long as a loop structure can be formed. Exemplary constructs are shown in the examples below. ShRNA are thought to assume a stem-loop structure with a 2 nucleotide 3\u2032 overhang that is recognized by Dicer and processed in to small interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNA are then recognized by RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which removes the sense strand from the stem structure and leaves the guide strand to associate with target mRNA, QSOX1 mRNA in this case, and cleave it. Full length protein cannot be translated after cleavage.",

                        "The inhibitors for use in the present invention can be administered via any suitable technique or formulation, including but not limited to lipid, virus, polymer, or any other physical, chemical or biological agent, but are generally administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. Such compositions are substantially free of non-pharmaceutically acceptable components, i.e., contain amounts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable components lower than permitted by US regulatory requirements at the time of filing this application. In some embodiments of this aspect, if the compound is dissolved or suspended in water, the composition further optionally comprises an additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein are solid pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., tablet, capsules, etc.). The isolated nucleic acids or shRNAs can be present in a vector, such as a viral vector (ex: retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, etc.), for delivery via any suitable technique.",

It is often detected in stage III resulting in an unresectable tumor at the time of diagnosis. However, even if pancreatic cancer is surgically resected in stage I or II, it may recur at a metastatic site (1, 2). Currently, patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have less than a 5% chance of surviving past five years (3). Through proteomic analysis of pancreatic cancer patient plasma, we discovered a peptide from QSOX1 that maps back to the C-terminus of the long isoform of QSOX1 (QSOX1-L) (4). Subsequently, we found that QSOX1 is over-expressed in tumor tissue from pancreatic cancer patients, but not adjacent normal tissue (FIGS. 1B & C). These findings led us to hypothesize that over-expression of QSOX1 might be functionally important for tumor cells, prompting further exploration of the role that QSOX1 might play in pancreatic cancer.",
                                "QSOX1 belongs to the family of FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases that are expressed in all eukaryotes sequenced to date. As eloquently shown by the Thorpe and Fass laboratories, the primary enzymatic function of QSOX1 is oxidation of sulfhydryl groups during protein folding to generate disulfide bonds in proteins, ultimately reducing oxygen to hydrogen peroxide (5-7). QSOX1 has been reported to be localized to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in human embryonic fibroblasts where it works with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) to help fold nascent proteins in the cell (8, 9).",
                                "In the human genome, QSOX1 is located on chromosome 1q24 and alternative splicing in exon 12 generates a long (QSOX1-L) and short (QSOX1-S) transcript (FIG. 1A) (10). Both, QSOX1-S and -L have identical functional domain organization from the amino terminus as follows: two thioredoxin-like domains (Trx1 &2), a helix rich region (HRR) and an Erv/ALR FAD-binding domain (5, 11). QSOX1-L contains a predicted transmembrane domain that is not present in QSOX1-S due to alternative splicing (FIG. 1A) (12). QSOX1 was originally discovered in quiescent human lung fibroblasts and was hypothesized to aid in the transition from G0 to S phase of the cell cycle (13, 14). Thorpe et al. revealed the ability of QSOX1 to efficiently generate disulfide bonds into proteins during folding at rate of 1000 per minute with a KM of 150 uM per thiol (7). QSOX1 appears to play a significant role in redox regulation within the cell, although the in vivo biological substrates are undefined as well as the functional significance associated with each splice variant.",

We knocked down QSOX1-S and -L protein expression using short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) in an attempt to reveal how pancreatic cancer cells might be affected. We assessed cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase activity. QSOX1 knock-downs affected tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. We observed a dramatic decrease in tumor cell invasion when QSOX1 expression was suppressed. Further investigation into the mechanism of invasion revealed that QSOX1 is at least partially responsible for MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity.

To determine which splice variant was more prevalent in our IHC images we analyzed tumor as well as adjacent normal tissue from 2 patients by western blot (FIG. 1C). Our results revealed that QSOX1-S is the dominant splice variant expressed also corroborating our IHC results that revealed an increase in QSOX1 expression in tumor samples. While our adjacent normal samples indicate a high level of QSOX1 expression, it is hard to determine if there was any tumor tissue contaminating our normal sample, which would account the increase in QSOX1 expression. Western blotting analysis shows that 4 pancreatic tumor cell lines, BxPC3, Panc-1, Capan1 and CFPac1 strongly express QSOX1-S and weakly express the longer splice variant, QSOX1-L. HPDE6, an immortal, non-tumorigenic pancreas epithelial cell line, shows weak expression of QSOX1-S and no expression of QSOX1-L (FIG. 1D).",

Second, QSOX1 protein expression in adjacent normal 1016, 1010, and HPDE6, a non-tumorigenic pancreatic duct cell line, is much weaker than it is in the patient tumor samples and four malignant pancreatic tumor cell lines.

Lentiviruses containing each shRNA were generated as described in \u201cMethods.\u201d BxPC3 and Panc-1 cells were transduced with each sh-lentivirus (shQSOX1) to evaluate the effects of QSOX1 knockdown on tumor cell growth. To demonstrate that the shQSOX1 are active in both cell lines, FIG. 2A-B shows reduced protein expression of both isoforms of QSOX1 in BxPC3 and Panc-1 tumor cell lines compared to scrambled shRNA in western blot analysis. This experiment demonstrates that sh742, sh528 and sh616 knock down of QSOX1-S expression in BxPC3 cells was 56%, 40% and 28%, respectively; for Panc-1 cells the knock down was 64%, 46% and 18%, respectively (FIG. 2A-B).",

To address this hypothesis, propidium iodide (PI) was used in flow cytometry to evaluate the effects of shQSOX1 on cell cycle. Our results indicate that suppression of QSOX1 expression did modulate cell cycle in both BxPC3 and Panc-1 compared to our untreated and scrambled control (data not shown). The results show that the reduced expression of QSOX1 on cell cycle could be cell dependent. BxPC3 showed an increase in G1 and a significant decrease in S, while Panc-1 cells showed a significant decrease in G1 but no changes in S.",

Compared to untreated and shScramble a consistent increase of 2-8% in early and late apoptosis (Annexin-V single and double positive) was observed for each of the shQSOX1 constructs in BxPC3 and Panc-1 cells.

To evaluate whether over-expression of QSOX1 in BxPC3 and/or Panc-1 cells plays a role in metastasis we performed invasion assays over an 18-hour period. Untreated, shScramble, sh742, sh528 and sh616-transduced cells were plated in serum-free medium on Matrigel\u2122-coated, 8 um pore inserts. Inserts were placed into wells containing 10% FBS in DMEM. After 18 hours of incubation, tumor cells that had degraded Matrigel\u2122 and migrated through 8 um pores onto the underside of the insert were counted (FIG. 4A-B).

                                "Since knock-down of QSOX1 protein expression in pancreatic tumor cells lines decreases invasion through Matrigel\u2122, it was important to determine the mechanism of inhibition of the invasive process. MMP-2 and -9 are key contributors of invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer (2). Both, pro-MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein levels are elevated in pancreatic tumors, and activated MMP-2 (a-MMP2) appears to be key contributors of metastasis in PDA (2, 22). Because QSOX1 has been suggested to be secreted into the extracellular matrix where MMPs are thought to be activated, we hypothesized that QSOX1 might help activate MMP-2 and -9 proteins. Untreated BxPC3 and Panc-1 cells, as well as transduced shScramble, sh742, sh528 and sh616 were incubated for 18-24 hours in serum free media after which supernatants were collected and subjected to gelatin-SDS-PAGE. Gelatin zymography was performed to determine if QSOX1 plays a role in secretion and/or activation of MMPs.",
                                "Our first observation from this experiment is that BxPC3 and Panc-1 have very different zymographic profiles. BxPC3 supernatants contain MMP-9 homodimer (130 kDa), a large amount of proteolytically active pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) with lesser concentrations of pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa) and a-MMP-2 (66 kDa). Panc-1 supernatants contain less prominent MMP-9 homodimer, pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) and a large amount of proteolytically active pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa), unlike BxPC3 cells.",
                                "Supernatants from BxPC3 cells transduced with sh742, sh528 and sh616 showed a 65%, 47% and 10% decrease, respectfully, in pro-MMP9 compared to shScramble (FIG. 5A). Supernatants from Panc-1 cells transduced with sh742, sh528 and sh616 showed a 70%, 56% and 15% decrease, respectfully, in pro-MMP-2. Thus, decreases in the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 and -9, using gelatin as a substrate, provide a mechanism for the shQSOX1-mediated suppression of invasion through Matrigel\u2122.",
                                "To confirm our gelatin zymography results we used western blot analysis of BxPC3 and Panc-1 serum free conditioned media to probe for MMP-2 and -9 (FIG. 5C). While our results indicate a slight decrease in MMP-2 and -9 (between 1 and 10% decrease using densitometry analysis) in BxPC3 and Panc-1 shQSOX1 treated cells it is nowhere near the level shown using gelatin zymography. This could be explained as a difference between a functional assay, gelatin zymography, and a purely quantitative assay such as western blot.",
                                "To extend our hypothesis that QSOX1 is influencing MMPs post-translationally, we performed quantitative real time PCR (QRTPCR) on MMP-2 and MMP-9 comparing the transcripts from shQSOX1 transduced cell lines with shScrambled. FIG. 5 demonstrates that MMP-2 and -9 RNA increased in the shQSOX1 transduced cells compared to control cells. This result adds confidence to our hypothesis that QSOX1 does not transcriptionally suppress MMP production, rather it post-translationally suppresses MMP activity. It also diminishes the possibility that shQSOX1 RNAs are suppressing MMP transcription due to off-target effects.",
                                "**Discussion for Example 1**",
                                "The mortality rate for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer has remained stagnant for the last five decades despite advanced surgical procedures and improvements in chemotherapeutics (23). Because most patients present with advanced metastatic disease, it is critical to understand the properties of invasive pancreatic tumors. Discovery and subsequent study of factors that contribute to tumor cell invasion provide an opportunity to develop therapeutics that could be used alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic agents. Prior to our report (4), it was not previously known that QSOX1 was over-expressed in pancreatic tumors. The results presented in FIG. 1 suggest that QSOX1 is a commonly over-expressed protein in PDA, making it a potential target. To extend those initial findings we began to investigate why pancreatic tumors over-express QSOX1, and mechanistically, what advantage it affords tumors.",
                                "Tumor cells in which QSOX1 protein expression was suppressed by shQSOX1 grew more slowly than the shScrambled and untreated controls as measured by an MTT assay, while the results with our strongest shQSOX1, sh742, show a greater that 50% decrease in cell growth in both BxPC3 and Panc-1 cells (FIG. 2C). Our attempt to try and explain the decrease in proliferation as a result of abnormal cell cycle regulation or an increase in apoptosis do not show a similar level of change that can solely explain our MTT results (FIG. 3, S2). Contrary to previous statements implicating QSOX1 as a cell cycle regulator (24), our results suggest that while the loss of QSOX1 in Panc-1 cells shows a consistent decrease in G1, there is no where near that effect when we analyzed BxPC3 cells suggesting that the role of QSOX1 could be cell type and tumor stage dependent, as a result of the different substrates available (S2). Our results likely conflict because we assessed the effect of QSOX1 on pancreatic tumor cell growth, not fibroblasts where QSOX1 was initially described (5, 24).",
                                "The same statement can be made in regards to the loss of QSOX1 directly affecting apoptosis. While our strongest knock-down, sh742, does show at its greatest an 8% increase in annexin V/propidium iodide double positive cells it is not enough to explain the dramatic decrease in cellular proliferation (FIG. 3). There are numerous proteins within the cell that assist in disulfide bond formation that may compensate for the loss of QSOX1 such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), thioredoxin, glutathione and members of the Erv family of sulfhydryl oxidases (25). There are no known preferred substrates of QSOX1 although speculation based on the function of QSOX1 as well as the known substrates that correspond to QSOX1 functional domains, leads us to believe that there are a broad spectrum of possible substrates and therefore the role that QSOX1 plays in tumor cell progression would most likely be influenced by the substrates with the greatest affinity for QSOX1. Compensation by these other oxidases could help explain why the loss of QSOX1 does not lead to significant alterations in the cell cycle and apoptosis. It is also possible that suppression of QSOX1 activity does not induce apoptosis, but results in other phenomena such as anoikis or autophagy (26). We may investigate these possibilities in future studies.",
                                "Another hallmark of cancer is invasion. Since suppression of QSOX1 did not appear to play a major role in tumor cell growth, we hypothesized that the over-expression of QSOX1 in pancreatic tumor cells may contribute to their ability to degrade basement membranes, leading to an invasive and metastatic phenotype. We discovered that suppression of QSOX1 protein resulted in a dramatic reduction in the ability of both BxPC3 and Panc-1 pancreatic tumor cells to invade through Matrigel\u2122 in vitro (FIG. 4). It is clear through these results that there are clear differences between BxPC3 and Panc-1 ability to degrade basement membrane components and invade. This could be due to a myriad of factors such as the proteases secreted, the stage of the tumor and genetic differences between the two cells lines (27). To determine if this reasoning was correct, we performed gelatin zymography as a way to analyze the matrix metalloproteinase activity.",
                                "As a sulfhydryl oxidase, it is unlikely that QSOX1 would directly degrade basement membrane components. Therefore, we hypothesized that MMPs serve as a substrate of QSOX1 while the MMPs are folding and undergoing activation as they are secreted from tumor cells. If true, suppression of QSOX1 would lead to a decrease in MMP functional activity, though not necessarily the amount of MMPs produced or secreted. Although the MMP profiles of BxPC3 and Panc-1 cells differ as seen in FIGS. 5A and B, we found that suppression of QSOX1 leads to a decrease in pro-MMP-2 and -9 activity. MMPs are zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes that degrade ECM components (22). There are 23 known human MMPs as well as 4 known tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP) that aid in regulating the expression and activation of these proteolytic enzymes (22). The expression patterns of MMPs are variable depending on tumor type, and even individual cell line.",
                                "In pancreatic cancer the majority of MMPs are secreted in their inactive form and activated extracellularly (28). Activation of MMPs occurs either through the release of a covalent Cys73-Zn2+  bond (\u201cCysteine Switch\u201d) or through cleavage and activation by plasmin, serine proteases, and other MMPs or TIMPs (21, 28). MMP-2 and -9 have been found to play an important role in pancreatic cancer progression with 93% of tumors expressing MMP-2 compared to normal tissue (28). While reports implicating MMP-9 in the progression of pancreatic cancer are limited, Tian reported the proteomic identification of MMP-9 in pancreatic juice from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (29). Pryczynicz et al. also found a relationship between MMP-9 expression and lymph node metastases (30). Numerous reports implicate MMP-2 as a prominent protease responsible for pancreatic tumor metastasis (2, 22, 28).",
                                "One of the benefits of gelatin zymography is that it a.) provides a functional measure of the activities of MMPs able to degrade gelatin and b.) differentiates each precursor and active MMP by molecular weight (21, 31). A limitation of the zymography shown here is that it is limited to MMPs whose substrate is gelatin. It is possible that QSOX1 is involved in activation of other MMPs with different substrates. This will be investigated in future work.",
                                "Following up on our initial hypothesis regarding MMP activation by QSOX1 we performed a western blot analysis on the same serum free conditioned media that was used to perform gelatin zymography. Our result revealed that the overall levels of secreted MMP-2 and -9 are nearly equal among the untreated, shScramble and shQSOX1 treated samples leading us to further hypothesize that QSOX1 is involved in the proper folding of MMPs before they are secreted and that the loss of QSOX1 leads to proteolytically inactive MMPs as shown in FIGS. 5A, B and C. To further confirm that what we are observing is a post-translational event we performed qPCR on BxPC3 and Panc-1 shQSOX1 treated cells (FIG. 5D-E). Our observation was surprising in that we are able to show that there is an overall increase in the transcription of MMP-2 and -9. This result led us to hypothesize that the cell is transcriptionally attempting to compensate for the proteolytically inactive MMPs through an as yet undetermined mechanism.",
                                "QSOX1 was previously reported by our group to be over-expressed in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (4), and that a peptide from the QSOX1 parent protein is present in plasma from patients with PDA. In the present study we demonstrated for the first time that expression of QSOX1 in pancreatic tumor cells directly contributes to an invasive and potentially metastatic phenotype through the activation of MMP-2 and -9 through an as yet undetermined mechanism. It is not known if QSOX1 is solely responsible for the proper folding of MMPs intracellularly, or if it cooperates with protein disulfide isomerase while MMPs are folding in the ER and golgi. Since MMPs are secreted extracellularly where they may undergo autoactivation or cleavage with proteases such as plasmin, it is possible that QSOX1-S activates them in the extracellular environment.",
                                "At this point, the post-translational mechanism by which QSOX1 activates MMPs is not clear. Our results indicate that MMP-2 and -9 RNA increased in shQSOX1 transduced cells. We expected no difference in MMP levels, but an increase might suggest that the cells are attempting to compensate for the lack of MMP activity through a feedback loop (32, 33). Although we hypothesize that QSOX1 may activate MMPs directly by involvement in the cysteine switch activation mechanism (21, 28), ROS produced by QSOX1 may be indirectly activating MMPs, as MMP activation has been reported to depend on an oxidative environment (32, 33).",
                                "Our results underscore the need to further understand the role that QSOX1 plays in tumor and normal cells, and how at the molecular level, it activates MMPs. This information will be useful during development of inhibitors of QSOX1 that may work upstream of individual MMPs.",

GOBO is a web based analysis tool that utilizes Affymetrics gene expression data curated from 1,881 breast cancer patients with associated stage, grade, nodal status and intrinsic molecular classification based on the paradigm first reported by the Perou Laboratory [18]. Expression of QSOX1 was significantly higher in ER+ tumors compared to ER\u2212 (P<0.00001), with the highest expression observed in Luminal A, Luminal B and Normal-like subtypes (FIG. 12a, b). The lowest QSOX1 transcript expression was observed in HER2-enriched and basal tumors. Using the GOBO tool, we performed a series of Kaplan Meier analyses to determine whether QSOX1 expression is associated with relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) (FIG. 12c, d). While elevated QSOX1 expression is not associated with survival when considering all breast tumor subtypes together, it is highly associated with poor RFS (P=0.00062) and OS (P=0.00031) in Luminal B tumors (FIG. 12c, d). The expression of QSOX1 correlates with increasing tumor grade as well as poor overall survival in patients diagnosed with grade 2 (P=0.04242) and grade 3 (P=0.07095) breast tumors. Elevated QSOX1 was also associated with reduced OS in Luminal A tumors and is a predictor of poor OS for patients who did not receive systemic treatment (data not shown).",

Statistical evaluation of QSOX1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated an association with ER+ tumors, and a strong association with high Ki-67 expression in patients with a high QSOX1 IHC score (FIG. 13a, Table 1). There was no relationship observed for QSOX1 expression in HER2+ tumors or cytokeratin markers (CK 5/6) positive tumors. These data are consistent with the correlation observed in the GOBO data. Interestingly, higher grade tumors were associated with a higher QSOX1 IHC score (FIG. 13a, Table 1). Conversely, lower QSOX1 protein expression is significantly associated with lower grade tumors. This is consistent with an association between QSOX1 expression and more aggressive ER+ tumors.",

To address this, propidium iodide (PI) was used in flow cytometry to evaluate the effects of shQSOX1 on cell cycle. In MCF7 cells, both shQSOX1 RNAs showed a slight decrease in G1 and an increase (11-12%) in S phase, while in BT474 cells both shQSOX1 RNAs showed a slight 12% increase in G1 and a 26% decrease in S phase but neither shQSOX1 RNA sequence had any effect in BT549 cells compared to untreated and shScramble controls (data not shown).",

We subsequently probed MCF7 and BT549 transduced cells for LC3, a protein that is necessary for auotphagosome formation [19]. If the expression of QSOX1 prevented cellular apoptosis or autophagy we would expect to see an increase in expression of Annexin V and LC3 in shQSOX1 transduced cells, but we did not observe any statistically significant increases in Annexin V positive cells (data not shown). This correlates with our previous results in pancreas cancer that the suppression of QSOX1 does not lead to cell death or autophagy.",

We performed a modified Boyden chamber assay using Matrigel\u2122-coated inserts in which tumor cells must degrade the Matrigel\u2122 and migrate through a membrane with 8 um pores to gain access to nutrient rich media. Sh742 and sh528-transduced MCF-7, BT549 and BT474 tumor cells were added to Matrigel\u2122-coated, 8 um pore inserts in serum-free medium. After 72 (MCF7) and 48 (BT549 and BT474) hours of incubation, tumor cells that were able to degrade Matrigel\u2122 and migrate through 8 um pores onto the underside of the insert were counted (FIGS. 10a, b and c). Our results demonstrate that knockdown of QSOX1 expression in MCF7 leads to a 65% and 71% reduction in invasion of sh742 and sh528 transduced tumor cells, respectively. For BT549 sh742- and sh528-transduced tumor cells, 60% and 40% decreases in invasion through Matrigel\u2122 were observed. Suppression of QSOX1 expression in BT474 cells leads to an 85% reduction in invasion of both sh742- and sh528-transduced tumor cells.

Addition of enzymatically active rhQSOX1 rescued the invasive phenotype of the shQSOX1-transduced tumor cells (FIG. 10d-f), while the addition of the rhQSOX1(AA) did not rescue invasion of the shQSOX1-transduced tumor cells.",

                                "Since knockdown of QSOX1 resulted in decreased breast tumor cell invasion, it was important to determine a mechanism for how QSOX1 might facilitate invasion. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been shown to play key roles in breast tumor invasion and metastasis [21]. Both MMP-2 and -9 mRNA and protein levels have been shown to contribute to breast tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis [22]. Since previous work demonstrated that QSOX1-S is secreted into the extracellular matrix where MMPs are activated, we hypothesized that QSOX1 might help activate MMP-2 and -9 proteins. MCF7 and BT549 cells transduced with shScramble, sh742 and sh528 were plated at equal densities and allowed to incubate in serum free media for 48 hours, after which the supernatants were collected and analyzed by gelatin zymography to determine if the loss of QSOX1 leads to a decrease in the functional activity of MMP-2 and -9.",
                                "Initial analysis of the results indicates that MCF7 and BT549 possess similar MMP profiles even though it is known that BT549 cells are more invasive. Luminal B-like breast tumor cell lines BT474 and ZR75 express do not secrete detectable levels of MMPs [23-25]. However, both MCF7 and BT549 supernatants contain MMP-9 homodimer (130 kDa), a large amount of proteolytically active pro-MMP-9 (92 kDa) with lesser concentrations of proteolytically active pro-MMP-2 (72 kDa).",
                                "We found that supernatants from MCF7 cells transduced with sh742 and sh528 showed a 70% and 77% decrease, respectively, in pro-MMP9 activity compared to shScramble (FIG. 11a). MCF7 supernatants from cells transduced with sh742 and sh528 also showed a 50% and 60% decrease in active MMP-9 (a-MMP-9) as well (FIG. 11a). Supernatants from BT549 cells transduced with sh742 and sh528 showed a 34% and 88% decrease, respectively, in MMP-9 (FIG. 11b).

Our results indicate that the intracellular amount of MMP-2 and -9 protein is similar between the untreated, shScramble, sh742 and sh528 samples in MCF7 and BT549 cells (FIG. 11c). FIG. 11d demonstrates that the loss of QSOX1 also has no significant effect on the transcriptional activity of MMP-2 and -9.

                                "To determine if QSOX1 was over-expressed in breast cancer, a GOBO analysis was performed using data from over 1,800 breast cancer cases. A prominent finding in this analysis is that the highest levels of QSOX1 expression in Luminal B breast cancer correlate with very poor RFS and OS (FIG. 12c, d). The median survival in patients with Luminal B breast cancer who over-express QSOX1 is approximately four years. The prognostic power of QSOX1 expression for RFS and OS increases when Luminal B breast cancer cases are divided into quintiles using the GOBO analysis tool for which patients with the highest fifth expression of QSOX1 have RFS of less than two years and OS of less than three years. In support of our GOBO analysis, showing that expression of QSOX1 is an indicator of poor OS and RFS in Luminal B breast cancer patients, we performed IHC on breast TMA samples. We were able to confirm that expression of QSOX1 significantly correlates with ER+ breast tumor (P=0.0013) cells as well as correlating with high Ki-67 expression (P=0.0011), further supporting a role for QSOX1 in cellular proliferation (FIG. 13a). Additionally, over-expression of QSOX1 mRNA in the GOBO analysis and high levels of protein in IHC correlate with increasing tumor grade in our breast tumor TMA analyses (FIG. 13; Table 1). Expression of QSOX1 did not correlate with survival in HER2 enriched tumors, ER\u2212 tumors or in tumors subtyped as basal-like. Importantly, in patients who did not receive systemic therapy (presumably due to diagnosis of very early stage disease), QSOX1 appears to be a predictor of poor OS. However, this association was not strong until more than five years post diagnosis.",
                                "Tumor cells in which QSOX1 expression was suppressed using shRNAs grew at less than half the rate of shScramble and untreated controls in MCF7, BT549 and BT474 cells (FIG. 14e-j). The results of the MTT and Trypan Blue assays confirm our breast TMA findings showing that high expression of QSOX1 correlates with high Ki-67 expression. Our attempt to explain the decrease in cell growth by abnormal cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and autophagy suggests that QSOX1 is not involved in apoptosis, or autophagy, but may marginally affect cell cycle, as we observed a stall in G1 and an increase in S phase in MCF7 cells (luminal-like) and an insignificant increase in G1 and a decrease in S phase in BT474 (luminal-like) cells compared to shScramble controls. However, there were no observable changes in BT549 cells (basal-like). These results, combined with our findings in PDA suggest that QSOX1 is unlikely to play a significant role in cell cycle. Our analysis of apoptosis and autophagy as a second possible mechanism contributing to the observed decrease in cell growth did not reveal significant increases in Annexin V/PI or LC3 expression (autophagy) in our shRNA treated cells. We also did not observe any increases in Trypan Blue positive cells during our cell growth assays compared to our shScramble control (data not shown).",
                                "The ability of a tumor cell to invade is one of several hallmarks of cancer [27]. Based on our results showing that QSOX1 over-expression in pancreas tumor cells contributes to invasion, we hypothesized that the over-expression of QSOX1 in breast adenocarcinoma would elicit a similar phenotype. MCF7, BT549 and BT474 cells transduced with QSOX1 shRNAs exhibited significant decreases in their ability to degrade basement membrane components and invade through Matrigel\u2122 (FIG. 10a-c). MCF7 cells are a poorly invasive, Luminal A-like breast cancer cell line, while BT549 (basal-like) and BT474 (Luminal B-like) cells are highly invasive [28, 29]. Although the invasive capabilities are dramatically different between these cell lines, QSOX1 knock-down suppressed growth and invasion in all cell lines irrespective of the level of QSOX1 expression (FIG. 13a) and molecular tumor subtype. Addition of exogenous recombinant QSOX1 protein to shQSOX1 transduced tumor cells rescued their invasive properties (FIG. 10d-f), confirming data indicating that QSOX1 is secreted into the extracellular matrix.",
                                "These findings indicate the advantage that QSOX1 provides to breast and pancreas tumors may be highly conserved and universal among other tumor types. What we can conclude from our human TMA analysis of QSOX1 protein expression is that QSOX1 is a very specific marker of tumor cells and that the expression of QSOX1 correlates with increased proliferation (high Ki-67) and an increase in tumor grade consistent with the characteristics of highly invasive tumors.",
                                "MMPs are a family of proteases that are involved in the degradation of basement membrane components contributing to tumor cell invasion and proliferation [34]. In breast tumors, gelatinases, MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been shown to play a significant role in growth and metastasis, as their expression is correlated with aggressive forms of breast cancer [25, 34, 35]. Gelatinases are secreted into the extracellular matrix in their inactive, pro-form where they can be activated through either a cysteine switch or shift in the prodomain mediated by integrins and laminin in basement membranes and structural proteins, such as vimentin [25]. Thiol binding proteins, such as glutathione, have also been shown to help fold and activate MMPs [35]. Our data indicate that MMPs could be one substrate of QSOX1. To address this we performed gelatin zymography to assess functional activity MMPs. Our data reveal that knockdown of QSOX1 protein expression in both MCF7 and BT549 cells leads to a decrease in MMP-9 functional activity compared to shScramble control (FIG. 11a, b). While the functional activity of MMP-2 and -9 was suppressed, mRNA encoding MMP-2 and -9 remained relatively constant in MCF-7 cells and increased in BT549 cells (FIG. 11c, d). BT474 cells unfortunately do not express or secrete levels of MMP-2 and -9 detectable by gelatin zymography [25, 36]. Interestingly, when we knock down QSOX1 in BT474 cells we observe the same phenotypic effects indicating that there are multiple substrates of QSOX1 contributing to our observed decrease in cellular proliferation and invasion. Taken together, the data suggest that QSOX1 may post-translationally activate MMPs.",
                                "QSOX1 is expressed during embryonic development in mouse and rat during key migratory stages [37]. This developmental data combined with our results indicating that QSOX1 expression facilitates degradation of basement membranes suggests that tumor cells over-express QSOX1 to allow them to break down basement membranes and invade into adjacent tissues or into circulation. QSOX1 expression in Luminal B subtype can help further stratify which tumors are likely to be more aggressive, leading to poor overall survival. Notably from these data we can project that targeting QSOX1 irrespective of tumor subtype could help to slow tumor cell proliferation as well as tumor cell invasion. This finding provides another tool for physicians and their patients to decide whether to more aggressively treat patients with Luminal B breast cancer whose tumors express high levels of QSOX1.",
