    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers are able to increase transcription from heterologous promoters when placed upstream, downstream and in either orientation, relative to the promoter. Transcriptional enhancers have been used to enhance expression of specific promoters in transgenic plants and in activation tagging studies to help elucidate gene function. A transcriptional enhancer from the Sugarcane Bacilliform Virus - Ireng Maleng isolate (SCBV-IM) that can cause increased transcription when integrated into the the genome near maize genes has been identified. In transgenic maize, the SCBV-IM promoter was shown to be comparable in strength to the maize ubiquitin 1 promoter in young leaf and root tissues. The promoter was dissected to identify sequences that confer high activity in transient assays. Enhancer sequences were identified and shown to increase the activity of a heterologous truncated promoter. These enhancer sequences were shown to be more active when arrayed in 4 copy arrays than in 1 or 2 copy arrays. When the enhancer array was transformed into maize plants it caused an increase in accumulation of transcripts of genes near the site of integration in the genome. The SCBV-IM enhancer can activate transcription upstream or downstream of genes and in either orientation. It may be a useful tool to activate enhance from specific promoters or in activation tagging.",

                "Enhancers are DNA elements that are able to increase transcription from other promoters whether they are placed upstream or downstream of transcription start sites and their promoter enhancing activity is independent of orientation relative to the transcription start site [1,2]. Enhancers that are effective in plants have been isolated from genes of plants as well as from genes of viruses and bacteria that infect plants. These include enhancers from the tobacco tCUP [3,4], the pea plastocyanin [5], the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) [6,7], the Figwort mosaic virus [8] and the Agrobacterium tumefacians 780 [9,10] and ocs promoters [11].",
                "Plant virus-derived promoters have been shown to be a rich source of strong constitutive promoters for use in plant biology and several have been shown to contain enhancer sequences [6,8]. The CaMV 35S promoter has been used extensively in driving transgenes in transgenic plants. Many other viral promoters have also been shown to effectively drive expression of transgenes; CaMV 19S, Rice tungro bacilform virus (RTBV) [12], Soybean chlorotic mottle virus [13], Mirabilis mosaic virus [14,15], Figwort mosaic virus (FMV) [16,17], Peanut streak chlorotic virus [18], Banana streak badnavirus [19], Cestrum yellow leaf curling virus (CmYLCV) [20] and Sugarcane bacilliform badnavirus (SCBV) [19,21,22]. Among these, the CaMV 35S and the FMV promoters have been demonstrated to have enhancer sequences within the promoter [6,8].",
                "The CaMV 35S enhancer [7] is the most common enhancer used in plant biology. Several studies have shown that the CaMV 35S promoter is not as active as other strong constitutive promoters in monocots [23-26], raising the question whether the CaMV 35S enhancer sequences are as effective in monocots as they are in dicots. However, 2x and 4x arrays of the CaMV 35S enhancer have been shown to enhance transcription of heterologous promoters in stable transformants of rice as well as to cause increased transcript accumulation of endogenous genes [27-30].",
                "The Sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV), like the Cauliflower mosaic virus, is in the Caulimoviridae family of viruses. While the Cauliflower mosaic virus is in the Caulimovirus genus and mostly infects dicots, SCBV is in the Badnavirus genus along with Commelina yellow mottle virus (CoMV) and RTBV and infects monocots [21]. Badnaviruses have circular genomes that produce a terminally redundant transcript [31,32]. Like CoMV, SCBV has three large open reading frames on its plus strand [33]. Promoters from several Badnaviruses have been shown to drive expression of heterologous genes in transgenic plants [16,19,22,34,35]. Because these viruses infect monocots, they may be useful sources of strong promoters for monocots. SCBV promoters from several isolates of the virus have been tested in transgenic plants and shown to be highly expressed in most tissues tested [21,22,36].",
                "We present a characterization of an 839\u00a0bp fragment of the Sugarcane Bacilliform Virus - Ireng Maleng isolate (SCBV-IM) promoter and demonstrate that it is comparable in strength to the strong maize ubiquitin 1 (ZmUBI1) promoter in transgenic maize. This work also presents a dissection of the SCBV-IM promoter and the identification of sequences that can enhance transcription when placed upstream of a truncated maize alcohol dehydrogenase (ZmADH1) promoter. Similar to what was seen with the CaMV 35S enhancer [8,37-39], multiple tandem copies of the SCBV-IM enhancer are more effective in increasing transcription than a single copy. An activation tagging element containing four tandem copies of the enhancer element has been introduced into maize. Examination of events containing the activation tagging element indicates that the 4x SCBV-IM enhancer is capable of causing an increase in accumulation of transcripts of native maize genes near the site of insertion of the SCBV-IM enhancer."

                        "To compare the strength of the SCBV-IM promoter relative to a known strong promoter, transgenic plants containing SCBV-IM::AAD1 and ZmUBI1::AAD1 transgenes were generated. AAD1 encodes an enzyme that degrades 2,4-D and aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides and plants expressing this gene are tolerant of these herbicides [40]. Transcript accumulation was measured in samples from various tissues of T1 plants by RT-qPCR. Tissue samples were taken from the youngest fully expanded leaf at the V3, and V8 stages, from the leaf below the developing ear at the R1 stage, from a 1\u00a0cm section from the tip of a root at V3 and V10 stages and from the tassels at R1 stage. Figure\u00a01 shows AAD1 transcript accumulation in 3 events containing each transgene. In the leaf samples collected at V3 stage, plants containing the SCBV-IM::AAD1 transgene accumulate more transcript than plants containing ZmUBI1::AAD1 (Figure\u00a01A), at the V8 stage, leaves accumulate similar amounts of AAD1 transcripts (Figure\u00a01B) while in the leaf samples of R1 plants lower levels of AAD1 transcript accumulate in the SCBV-IM::AAD1 transgenic plants (Figure\u00a01C). In the roots of V3 and V10 plants, SCBV-IM::AAD1 transgenic plants accumulate more of the AAD1 transcripts than ZmUBI1::AAD1 transgenic plants (Figure\u00a01D and E). In tassel tissues, ZmUBI1::AAD1 transgenic plants accumulate more AAD1 transcript. These results demonstrate that the SCBV-IM promoter is stronger or comprable in strength to the strong, constitutively expressed maize ubiquitin 1 promoter [26] in young leaf and root tissues, but is weaker in the leaf below the devloping ear and in tassel tissues at R1.Figure 1 Comparison of the SCBV-IM and ZmUBI1 promoters in transgenic maize tissues. Transgenic, single copy maize events containing SCBV-IM::AAD1 and ZmUBI1::AAD1 constructs were analyzed for AAD1 transcript accumulation in the youngest fully expanded leaf of V3 (A) and V8 (B) stage plants, the leaf just below the ear of R1 plants (C), a 1\u00a0cm section from the tip of the root in V3 (D) and V10 (E) stage plants, and in the tassels of R1 stage plants (F). Three events for each of the two constructs were compared by RT-qPCR using primers specific to the AAD1 transcript and normalized to an endogenous transcript, TIP (for leaf and tassel tissues) or MAZ95 (for root tissues). The error bars represent the standard deviation of three measurements. Analysis of Variance (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05) indicate that more AAD1 transcript accumulate in the SCBV-IM::AAD1 events than in ZmUBI1::AAD1 events in leaves of V3 stage plants, the roots of V3 and V8 stage plants, while similar levels of AAD1 transcript accumulate in leaves of V8 stage plants. ZmUBI1::AAD1 transgenic plants accumulate more AAD1 transcript than SCBV-IM::AAD1 transgenic plants in leaf and tassel tissues at R1."

Two days after the bombardment, total protein was isolated from transfected cells and LUC and GUS enzymatic activities were determined. Activity was expressed as the ratio of LUC to GUS activity. The results show that the promoter fragment SCBV576 had 60% of the activity of the SCBV839 promoter fragment (Figure\u00a03) and the SCBV333 promoter fragment had only 10% of the activity of the SCBV839 fragment. These data indicate that sequences necessary for most of the SCBV-IM promoter activity reside upstream of the 333\u00a0bp fragment.Figure 3 Promoter analysis of the SCBV-IM promoter. Three fragments of the SCBV-IM promoter fused with the luciferase reporter gene and tested for activity in transient assays and compared with a luciferase construct without a promoter.

Overall, these promoters gave much lower activity than the intact SCBV promoter (Figure\u00a04). This may be because the ZmADH1 chimeric promoters are inherently weaker than the intact SCBV-IM promoter or because a promoter fragment of the SCBV-IM promoter necessary for high activity was not included in the chimeric constructs.Figure 4 Enhancer analysis of the SCBV-IM promoter. Two fragments of the SCBV-IM promoter were fused with the truncated ZmADH1 promoter and the luciferase reporter gene.

These results indicate that these fragments of the SCBV-IM promoter cause an increase in activity of the reporter gene driven by a truncated heterologous promoter, and that most of this enhancing activity lies within the \u2212434\u00a0bp to \u2212153\u00a0bp region.",

Constructs containing 1, 2 and 4 tandem copies of the SCBV-IM enhancer had 5 times, 6 times and 10 times more activity, respectively, than did cells bombarded with the ZmADH1::LUC construct without any SCBV-IM sequences (Figure\u00a05). It should be noted that in the experiment shown in Figure\u00a05, the activity of SCBV282::ZmADH1::LUC and ZmADH1::LUC was substantially greater than in the experiment shown in Figure\u00a04. However, similar variation in promoter activity between independent experiments conducted with different cell preparations has previously been reported [42].Figure 5 Analysis of SCBV-IM enhancer arrays.

Determination of the site of integration of the construct was attempted for 223 events by a transgene border sequence identification method [45] and 107 of these events were mapped to locations in the maize B73 reference genome. To determine whether the enhancers within the T-DNA sequence are able to cause an increase in transcript accumulation of endogenous genes, these transformants were examined to identify T-DNA insertion sites within ~5.5 Kb of a gene. The CaMV 35S enhancer has been demonstrated to up-regulate genes within ~8 Kb of the enhancer sequences [29,46].",
                        "Eleven events were examined to determine whether transcripts of genes adjacent to the activation tagging element were more abundant in the transgenic events than non-transgenic control plants. For five of these genes (GRMZM2G078472, GRMZM2G142119, GRMZM2G071986, GRMZM2G444075 and AC183888.4_FG008), no transcripts were detected in either the transgenic or non-transgenic lines. For the six other genes, transcripts were detected from genes adjacent to the activation tagging element. In these events, two genes (GRMZM2G456132 and GRMZM2G065718) showed a similar level of these transcripts in transgenic and non-transgenic plants (Figure\u00a07). However, in 4 other events the transcripts of genes adjacent to the activation tagging element were more abundant in the transgenic plant than the non-transgenic plant. For two genes (GRMZM2G140537 and GRMZM2G104760), the transgenic plant showed more transcript than did the non-transgenic plant; this increase in abundance was 2.5 and 3.2 fold, respectively. For the other two genes (GRMZM2G010372 and GRMZM2G054713), no transcript was detectable in the non-transgenic plant but transcript was clearly detectable in the transgenic plant. These results demonstrate the 4x tandem array of the SCBV-IM enhancer can increase transcript abundance in a stable transformed maize plant and in some cases may cause ectopic expression of genes that are not expressed, or expressed at very low levels. It also indicates that the 4x tandem array of the SCBV-IM enhancer meets the traditional definition of an enhancer [47,48] because it can function upstream or downstream of the transcription unit and in either orientation.Figure 7 Analysis of enhancer activity in transgenic maize plants. The relative locations of the activation tagging element and the gene examined are shown. The activation tagging element is represented by four yellow boxes representing the 4\u00d7 SCBV enhancer tandem array and the blue arrow representing the AAD1 selectable marker cassette. Maize genes are represented by the green box with the transcription start site and direction represented by the arrow. Distance to promoter reflects the estimated distance from the enhancers to the translational start site of the gene. The relative transcript abundance is the amount of transcript of the gene in transgenic plants compared with the level of the transcript in non-transgenic plants. An asterix indicates that the values were significantly different as determined by a t-test (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05)."

                "The promoter sequences that we define include significant portions of the SCBV ORF III gene. The SCBV839 sequence, which has the greatest activity in transient assays, overlaps with 525 protein coding nucleotides. The sequences overlapping the ORF III gene contain most of the promoter activity as demonstrated by the SCBV333 fragment containing only 20\u00a0bp of the ORF III gene and having just 10% of the promoter activity of the SCBV839 sequence (Figure\u00a03). The SCBV282 enhancer fragment contains 189\u00a0bp of ORF III coding sequence. A similar situation is found in Arabidopsis where regulatory elements for the promoter of ZWICHEL (ZWI) gene are found in exon and intron sequences of the adjacent HYDROXYISOBUTYRL-CoA HYDROLASE 1 (CHY1) gene [49].",
                "The enhancer sequences in the SCBV-IM promoter were able to increase the activity of the truncated ZmADH1 promoter (Figure\u00a04), but these chimeric promoters were much weaker than the intact SCBV-IM promoter in the transient assays (Figure\u00a03). This difference is so great it is unlikely to be the result of different cell preparations and may be the result of the SCBV-IM upstream activating sequences interacting differently with the heterologous core ZmADH1 promoter and the native SCBV-IM promoter. Similar results were seen when the CaMV 35S enhancer was placed upstream of the CaMV 19S core promoter [38].",
                "Deletion analysis of the SCBV-IM promoter showed that removing sequences from \u2212770 to \u2212507 caused a 30% decline in promoter activity, while removing sequences from \u2212770 to \u2212264 caused a 90% decline in activity (Figure\u00a03). It was, therefore, somewhat surprising to observe that the chimeric promoter SCBV537::ZmADH1 (containing SCBV-IM sequences \u2212689 to \u2212153) had less activity than the chimeric promoter SCBV282::ZmADH1 (containing SCBV-IM sequences \u2212434 to \u2212153) since the longer fragment in the promoter deletion analysis had the most activity. Surprising results are often obtained when portions of promoters are added or deleted and even small portions of promoters can have dramatic effects. For example, Dey and Matti [15] showed that removing 50\u00a0bp of the MMV promoter increased activity 10 fold and Simon et al. [50] showed that deleting 54\u00a0bp of the Inner No Outer promoter of Arabidopsis could reverse a silenced promoter.",
                "Multiple copies of the SCBV-IM enhancer cause an increase in activity of the chimeric promoters in transient assays (Figure\u00a05). This is consistent with what has been observed with the CaMV 35S and FMV ehancers [8,37-39] and may be due to multiple copies of the enhancer being more efficent in recruiting transcription factors to the promoter.",
                "The SCBV282 fragment is capable of acting as a transcriptional enhancer when present in the maize genome in a 4x tandem array. In events containing the 4x SCBV-IM enhancer upstream and downstream of genes, and in either orientation with respect to these genes, increased transcript accumulation was observed (Figure\u00a07). Furthermore, the element appeared to cause accumulation of transcripts that are not present, or present in very low levels, in non-transgenic lines. This demonstrates that the SCBV-IM enhancer may be used for activation tagging in maize. The SCBV-IM enhancers increased expression of 2 out of 8 genes that showed non-detectable expression in non-transgenic control plants. This is similar some studies that have reported ectopic expression of genes when the CaMV 35S enhancers integrate nearby [51,52]."

The CaMV 35S enhancer has been used to develop activation tagging systems for Arabidopsis, rice and barley. Using these activation tagging systems, researchers have identified a number of genes with novel functions [28,53-57]. To date, no activation tagging system has been developed for maize. As a first step in developing an activation tagging system for maize, we have identified a transcriptional enhancer from SCBV-IM and have shown it to be able to activate transcription from a truncated ZmADH1 promoter in transient assays and from endogenous promoters in transformed maize plants."
