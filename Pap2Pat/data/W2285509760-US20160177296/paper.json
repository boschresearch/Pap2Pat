    "title": "Inhibiting avian influenza virus shedding using a novel RNAi antiviral vector technology: proof of concept in an avian cell model",
    "date": "2016-02-24",
    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses pose significant health and economic threats to humans and animals. Outbreaks of avian influenza virus (AIV) are a liability to the poultry industry and increase the risk for transmission to humans. There are limitations to using the AIV vaccine in poultry, creating barriers to controlling outbreaks and a need for alternative effective control measures. Application of RNA interference (RNAi) techniques hold potential; however, the delivery of RNAi-mediating agents is a well-known obstacle to harnessing its clinical application. We introduce a novel antiviral approach using bacterial vectors that target avian mucosal epithelial cells and deliver (small interfering RNA) siRNAs against two AIV genes, nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase acidic protein (PA). Using a red fluorescent reporter, we first demonstrated vector delivery and intracellular expression in avian epithelial cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated significant reductions in AIV shedding when applying these anti-AIV vectors prophylactically. These antiviral vectors provided up to a 10,000-fold reduction in viral titers shed, demonstrating in vitro proof-of-concept for using these novel anti-AIV vectors to inhibit AIV shedding. Our results indicate this siRNA vector technology could represent a scalable and clinically applicable antiviral technology for avian and human influenza and a prototype for RNAi-based vectors against other viruses.",

                "Avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks in poultry have led to the global culling of millions of birds and the net loss of billions of dollars. These outbreaks are of concern, not only because of the degree of virulence observed in poultry resulting in severe economic consequences, but also due to the potential transmission to mammalian species, including humans.",
                "Effective prevention measures must be available to prepare for potential outbreaks, however, current vaccination strategies for birds are limited. The most efficacious vaccines must be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly (Halvorson 2008; Rudolf et al. 2010; Swayne 2012), an impediment to successfully immunizing large numbers of poultry in a short period. In the na\u00efve bird, protective antibody production takes two to 3\u00a0weeks to acquire following vaccination (Kim et al. 2009). Frequently, improper storage and handling leads to vaccine failure (Swayne and Kapczynski 2008). To elicit efficient protection, the vaccine must be HA-subtype specific to the outbreak virus (Arzt et al. 2010; Bennink and Palmore 2004; Escorcia et al. 2008; Swayne 2012; Zhou et al. 2008). Over time, stockpiles of vaccines become obsolete and new vaccines must be generated. These limitations convey a genuine need to develop a prophylactic that would offer universal protection against any subtype or strain of AIV and would provide rapid protection in the face of an outbreak.",
                "Using RNAi to develop antivirals has created a wealth of research focused on controlling diseases using siRNAs (Barik and Lu 2015; Chen et al. 2009; DeVincenzo 2012; Long et al. 2010; Lyall et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2012). Others have previously demonstrated that siRNA mediated knockdown targeting both the viral NP and PA genes significantly inhibits influenza replication (Ge et al. 2004; Khantasup et al. 2014; Stoppani et al. 2015; Tompkins et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2007, 2008). However, the challenge of intracellular delivery of these RNAi-mediating agents has historically been an obstacle to harnessing their capabilities and clinical application (Li and Shen 2009). SiRNAs require a delivery vehicle, and two examples are genetically engineered viruses and synthetic carriers (Aigner 2009; DeVincenzo 2012; Ge et al. 2004; Li et al. 2006). However, these viral delivery vectors can pose significant concerns for clinical efficacy, including associated hepatotoxicity and tumorigenesis (Beer et al. 2010; Davidson and McCray 2011; Ge et al. 2004; Grimm et al. 2006; Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2008). Past reports warn of off-target effects from short hairpin RNA (shRNA) viral vectors resulting in cell death and organ problems in transgenic animals (Grimm et al. 2006). Finally, synthetic siRNA carriers have low delivery efficiencies and require higher doses, which is not only cost prohibitive, but often toxic (DeVincenzo 2012; Ge et al. 2004).",
                "The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition of AIV shedding in avian epithelial cells using the RNAi delivery platform, transkingdom RNAi (tkRNAi). TkRNAi uses nonpathogenic E. coli engineered to transcribe shRNA from a plasmid (pmbv43) that also encodes two factors allowing shRNA delivery to mucosal epithelial cells; the invasin gene (Inv) and the listeriolysin O gene (hylA). The Inv gene is necessary for expression of invasin protein on the E. coli surface (Xiang et al. 2006), which interacts with \u03b2(1) integrin receptors present on mucosal epithelial cells resulting in receptor mediated endocytosis (Conte et al. 1994; Isberg and Barnes 2001; Isberg and Leong 1990). The hlyA gene encodes a pore-forming toxin that facilitates the rupture of the endosomal membrane and the subsequent release of shRNA into the cell\u2019s cytoplasm (Grillot-Courvalin et al. 1998; Mathew et al. 2003; Nguyen and Fruehauf 2009; Radford et al. 2002; Xiang et al. 2006). The tkRNAi vector is a diaminopimelic acid (Dap) auxotrophic mutant and is kanamycin resistant.",
                "Figure\u00a01 provides a diagrammatic picture of the anti-AIV vector\u2019s mechanism of action in an avian epithelial cell and its ability to inhibit infectious AIV shedding. We designed tkRNAi vectors (anti-AIV vectors) that constitutively generate shRNAs targeting conserved sequences within the NP and PA viral genes, with the purpose to demonstrate in vitro proof-of-concept for using these anti-AIV vectors to inhibit AIV shedding in an avian cell model. These anti-AIV vectors would offer several advantages over conventional AIV vaccines and improve upon existing RNAi antiviral approaches for several reasons. These vectors are engineered to target mucosal epithelium, so are ideal for targeted delivery aimed at preventing respiratory diseases. As non-conjugative vectors, they will not integrate into the host genome, eliminating the risk for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the tkRNAi platform has a confirmed safety record for clinical purposes (Nguyen and Fruehauf 2009; Xiang et al. 2006, 2009), and as non-conjugative, non-pathogenic and non-colonizing bacteria, do not pose any known risk to the host. Although these vectors target viral sequences that have high levels of conservation observed over time and geographic location to limit the risk for viral escape, they can be quickly adapted to respond to viral mutation. Unlike conventional vaccines, this antiviral vector would reduce trade barriers associated with reactivity of vaccinated animals because animals would not test positive for AIV antibodies. These vectors could be administered intranasally, orally, or as an aerosol suitable for inhalation. Finally, these anti-AIV vectors could be generated in a scalable process for low-cost production, stockpiled for long-term use, and applied rapidly via mass aerosolization.Fig.\u00a01Diagrammatic representation of the anti-AIV vector\u2019s mechanism of action against AIV in an avian epithelial cell"

To decrease the possibility of off-target silencing, both 19 nt siRNA sequences were analyzed by BLAST search to ensure a lack of significant sequence complementarity to any known chicken gene sequence.

The wide range of genetic variation among different strains and subtypes of AIV makes it difficult to design siRNAs that can remain effective as antivirals. Therefore, it is important to design siRNAs targeting highly conserved sequences observed across many different strains, including HPAI viruses. Both siRNA sequences had 100\u00a0% alignment against\u00a0>10,000 type A influenza viruses, including those isolated from swine, avian, equine, canine, and humans.

The potency of these two unique siRNA sequences has been extensively evaluated in previous work using traditional transfection techniques (Abrahamyan et al. 2009; Ge et al. 2003, 2004; Khantasup et al. 2014; Li et al. 2005; Sui et al. 2009; Tompkins et al. 2004)."

                        "The use of chicken primary hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial cells was not intended to represent a model for epithelial cells of the avian respiratory system. The tkRNAi system is not specific for respiratory mucosal epithelia; it broadly targets all mucosal epithelia. While tkRNAi delivery has been well documented in mammalian mucosal epithelial cells, this study reports the first time tkRNAi has been evaluated in avian cells. LMH cells were chosen to broadly represent an avian tissue model to verify that chicken \u03b2(1) integrin recognizes and interacts with invasion, the antigen expressed by the tkRNAi delivery vector and required for intracellular uptake. Moreover, LMH cells were utilized for this initial in vitro proof of concept work because they represent a commercially available chicken cell line with good reproducibility, they are specifically intended for transfection studies, they represent an appropriate avian tissue cell for AIV infection (Shinya et al. 1995;\u00a0Swayne and Pantin-Jackwood 2006), and as epithelial hepatocytes, they represent appropriate mucosal epithelial cells to test tkRNAi vector uptake. Therefore, the expression of \u03b2(1) integrin in LMH cells when uninfected and post AIV infection was validated (Fig.\u00a02). The maximum anti-AIV/scramble concentration allowable, without inducing CPE indicative of cytotoxicity, was 7.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0CFU/mL. Therefore, all subsequent experiments adopted this vector concentration. Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated intracellular expression of the RFP-vector in LMH cells at two and 24\u00a0h post invasion (Fig.\u00a03). Flow cytometry further verified intracellular RFP-vector expression at\u00a020 and 36\u00a0h post invasion with 7.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 CFU/mL. The tkRNAi invasion efficiencies in LMH cells were calculated to be 74.1 and 75.7\u00a0%, respectively (Fig.\u00a04). Together, these results indicated the tkRNAi delivery platform was appropriate for avian cells.Fig.\u00a02mRNA expression of \u03b2-actin and \u03b2(1)\u00a0integrin in LMH cells cultured in normal growth medium (GM), inoculation medium without virus (IM), or infection medium six or 24 hpi with H8N4 virusFig.\u00a03Vector uptake by chicken LMH cells assessed at two and 24\u00a0h post invasion with the anti-AIV/scramble vector tagged with RFP.

                        "Previous work has demonstrated inhibition of viral NP and PA mRNA transcripts using RT-qPCR following transfection with the same 19nt NP and PA siRNA constructs utilized in this work (Abrahamyan et al. 2009; Ge et al. 2003; Khantasup et al. 2014; Li et al. 2005; Sui et al. 2009). The objective of this current work was to show inhibition of infectious viral particle shedding. RT-qPCR does not differentiate between infectious and non-infectious virus, however, the TCID50 assay allows for the quantification of infectious viral particles. Therefore, given how extensively the potency of these siRNAs have been validated using RT-qPCR in avian and mammalian models against AIV and to aid in demonstrating the efficacy for inhibiting infectious virus, LMH cell culture supernatants containing shed virus were quantitated by TCID50 on MDCK cells and infectious titer was expressed as the TCID50/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in adjusted mean viral titers between PC and mock-invasion samples (data not shown); therefore, PC samples were used to make statistical comparisons to the vector treated samples. The 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean viral titers were calculated and represent the magnitude of variability between viral titers on different experimental days and across replicates (Table\u00a03). The adjusted mean viral titers between anti-AIV vector treated and untreated PC samples were compared across all experimental days (Table\u00a03). These results indicated the level of antiviral activity was more pronounced against the H8N4 virus. However, in all experimental sets and for both H8N4 and H6N2, the cocktail vector resulted in significantly lower viral titers compared to the corresponding PC titers, with log10 reductions ranging from 1.9\u20134.0.Table\u00a03Anti-AIV vector protection in chicken LMH cells as measured by log10 and fold-reductions in viral shedding titers compared to untreated controlsSample n Adjusted meana (treated)95\u00a0% CI (treated)Adjusted mean (PC)95\u00a0% CI (PC) P valueb Log10 reductionc Fold reductiond H8N4 virus MOI 0.01\u00a0Anti-AIV/NP91.1(0.0, 2.6)4.9(3.7, 6.2)<0.0013.86310\u00a0Anti-AIV/PA93.0(2.1, 3.8)5.5(4.6, 6.4)<0.0012.5316\u00a0Anti-AIV/cocktail90.9(0.0, 2.1)4.9(3.9, 6.0)<0.0014.010,000\u00a0Anti-AIV/scramble102.8(2.0, 3.5)4.9(4.1, 5.8)<0.0012.1126H6N2 virus MOI 0.01\u00a0Anti-AIV/NP94.7(3.1, 6.2)6.3(4.8, 8.0)0.0431.639.8\u00a0Anti-AIV/PA94.9(3.6, 6.2)6.3(4.8, 7.9)0.0311.425.1\u00a0Anti-AIV/cocktail94.4(3.0, 5.9)6.3(4.9, 7.8)0.0131.979.4\u00a0Anti-AIV/scramble95.5(4.6, 6.3)6.3(5.3, 7.4)0.0530.86.3Mean viral titers were adjusted by day, using experimental day as a fixed effect aExpressed as mean log10 TCID50/mL adjusted by day bComparing adjusted mean log10 TCID50/mL from treated to untreated PC samples (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) cLog10 reduction in mean infectious titer compared to untreated control dFold reduction in infectious titer (geometric mean) compared to untreated control"

                "RNAi approaches have been used to demonstrate the antiviral activity of siRNAs against influenza viruses and report various degrees of viral inhibition in multiple subtypes tested (Ge et al. 2003, 2004; Jiao et al. 2013; Khantasup et al. 2014; Li et al. 2005; Stoppani et al. 2015; Tompkins et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2007, 2008). In one study, siRNAs targeting NP and PA inhibited the lab-adapted PR8 virus (Ge et al. 2003). In mice experiments, NP and PA siRNAs/shRNAs have inhibited multiple type A influenza subtypes, including H5N1 and mouse-adapted H1N1, H7N7 and H9N2 (Ge et al. 2004; Tompkins et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2008). A recent siRNA study, targeting NP, reports inhibition against AIV (H7N1) and swine influenza (H1N2, H3N2, and H1N1 strains) (Stoppani et al. 2015). Critically, in all of these studies, viral reductions represent those associated with siRNA/shRNA silencing using traditional RNAi delivery approaches. Our work represents the first time tkRNAi has been assessed both as an shRNA delivery vehicle to avian cells and as an antiviral for influenza virus. If the in vitro success of this antiviral validated in this current work can be demonstrated with future in vivo studies, this antiviral technique has the potential to attain clinical relevance by providing a safe and efficacious method of delivering siRNAs to target tissues, including avian epithelium, without inducing cytotoxicity. Nonrelated work has successfully used this RNAi delivery approach to target cancer genes (Buttaro and Fruehauf 2010; Kruhn et al. 2009; Xiang et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2005). Cequent Pharmaceuticals (now Marina Biotech, Bothell, WA, USA) recently developed a therapeutic based on the tkRNAi platform (CEQ508), which is currently in clinical testing for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis in humans.",
                "As was demonstrated in our work and in previous studies, there were variations in the level of viral inhibition observed when the same siRNA construct was used against different AIVs. This can be explained in several ways. It is possible that in different AIVs these target mRNA sequences correspond with slightly different functions and might interact differently with host factors or interact with entirely separate host factors, all resulting in slightly altered siRNA potency. Directly measuring anti-AIV vector knockdown of NP and PA could help explain the observed variation in antiviral activity between viruses. However, our outcome of interest was the ability of these anti-AIV vectors to inhibit infectious viral shedding. As such, quantitating infectious viral titers using the TCID50 assay was an appropriate end-point analysis for this work. Additionally, including the anti-AIV/scramble vector served as a method of differentiating NP and PA shRNA antiviral activity associated with targeting the NP and PA viral genes from any non-specific viral inhibition caused by the bacterial vector itself. In all experiments, and for both viruses tested, antiviral activity associated with the NP and PA specific anti-AIV vectors was more potent compared to the scramble vector alone.",
                "The scramble vector had less profound antiviral activity, but it did reduce infectious AIV titers. There is a possible explanation for this observation. The innate immune response is part of the host\u2019s early defense mechanism. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the innate response by recognizing and binding bacterial components, including endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which act as immune enhancers (Bessler et al. 1990). Nonpathogenic E. coli bacteria deliver these anti-AIV vectors; therefore, it is not surprising that the extracellular presence of bacterial endotoxins would be detected, likely via TLR-4 recognition (Schoen et al. 2004). In this case, LPS could act like a vaccine adjuvant, thereby stimulating the innate response prior to AIV infection and mounting an additional level of viral protection.",
                "This work was necessary and provided in vitro proof-of-concept demonstrating both successful delivery and the antiviral potential of these novel anti-AIV vectors against AIV in an avian cell model. Further work is needed to determine if these antiviral vectors would reduce AIV shedding in poultry. As such, findings from this work have been translated into ongoing efforts aimed at assessing efficacy in experimentally challenged chickens. This novel antiviral could represent a more effective and universal control method for AIV in poultry. These vectors were engineered for targeted siRNA delivery to mucosal epithelium, including respiratory tissues, and could be applied to large populations of birds using a spray or nebulization technique. Therefore, this antiviral approach could represent a scalable and clinically applicable technology for avian and human influenza and a prototype for RNAi-based antivirals against other viruses that infect mucosal tissues."
