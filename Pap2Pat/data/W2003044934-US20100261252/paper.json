    "abstract": "Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases from Haemophilus influenzae are extracellular proteases that specifically cleave the hinge region of human IgA1, the predominant class of immunoglobulin present on mucosal membranes. The IgA1 proteases may have the potential to cleave IgA1 complexes in the kidney and be a therapeutic agent for IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN), a disease characterized by deposition of the IgA1 antibody in the glomerulus. We have screened for the expression of recombinant H. influenzae IgA1 protease by combining various expression plasmids, IgA1 protease constructs, and E. coli strains under multiple conditions. Using the method we have developed, approximately 20-40 mg/L of soluble and active H. influenzae IgA1 protease can be produced from E. coli strain C41(DE3), a significant increase in yield compared to the yield upon expression in H. influenzae or other related bacteria.",

                "Immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) proteases from bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella melaninogenica, and other bacterial strains are a group of proteases that specifically cleave the IgA1 hinge region of human IgA1 and some great apes. IgA1 proteases neither cleave human IgA2, IgG, and IgM nor do they cleave IgA from mice, rat, or even monkey [1][2][3]. The C. ramosum IgA protease, in addition, cleaves human IgA2m(1) allotype [4]. In addition to the IgA1 hinge length and composition [5][6][7], structures in the Fc region [8] and different sites in the CH3 domain [9] of IgA1 are required for cleavage.",
                "IgA1 proteases are comprised of at least three families having different structural forms including serine-, metallo-, and cysteine-type proteases. The serine type IgA1 proteases are expressed as a precursor protein comprising a signal peptide, an IgA1 protease domain, and a C-terminal \u03b1 protein and \u03b2-core domain. The C-terminal \u03b2-core domain targets the protein to the cell membrane and facilitates secretion of a \u03b1 protein-protease domain polypeptide. The \u03b2 domain and \u03b1 protein are cleaved from the precursor polypeptide leaving the protease domain as the mature protease. The metallo-type IgA1 proteases comprise a signal sequence and propeptide which aids in anchoring the peptide to the cell membrane and contains several sites for metal ion (e.g., zinc) binding in the protease domain. The structure for the cysteine-type IgA1 protease has yet to be determined. The IgA1 proteases of H. influenzae and Neisseria species are of the serine type. For serine type IgA1 proteases, cleavage between proline and serine is designated as type 1 whereas cleavage between proline and threonine is designated as type 2. Those IgA1 proteases produced by streptococcal species are of the metallo type; the C. ramosum IgA protease has a unique sequence and is a different type of metalloproteinase. The cysteine types of IgA1 proteases are produced by Prevotella species [4,[10][11][12][13][14][15].",
                "IgA nephropathy (IgAN), a disease characterized by deposition of the IgA1 antibody in the glomerulus, can lead to kidney dysfunction and, in certain cases, kidney failure [16]. Exogenous proteolytic enzymes have been tested as therapy to treat IgA1 deposition in animal models in an attempt to remove IgA1 deposits in the kidneys. The administered proteases, chymopapain and subtilisin, act by proteolytic cleavage of IgA1 deposits in the kidney but are not specific for IgA1 molecules and digest a variety of other proteins [17,18]. The IgA1-specific IgA1 protease from H. influenzae has been used to treat IgAN in animal models. The H. influenzae IgA1 protease reduced the deposition of glomerular IgA1 immune complexes in a passive mouse model [19]. IgA1 protease may have potential as a therapeutic agent for IgAN. Production of IgA1 protease in amounts sufficient for therapeutic use has not been achieved due to the low natural production of the protein in naturally producing cells such as H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis. Moreover, H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitidis are pathogenic bacterial species, and H. influenzae requires hemin for growth which makes it impractical for production of IgA1 proteases at a large scale. The soluble and active IgA1 proteases from S. pneumoniae, S. suis, and C. ramosum have been expressed in E. coli at a low yield [4,20,21]. We report here a method of expressing only the protease domain (without \u03b1 protein and \u03b2-core domain) of H. influenzae IgA1 protease in E. coli, wherein the yield and total recovery of soluble and active recombinant IgA1 protease are significantly increased compared to previous methods."

                        "Proteases in E. coli. The serine-type IgA1 protease is initially translated as a precursor composed of four functional domains: (i) an amino terminal signal peptide to target it through the inner membrane to the periplasm; (ii) the mature protease domain; (iii) the \u03b1protein domain, and (iv) the \u03b2-core domain for transport across the outer membrane. The \u03b2-core domain integrates into the outer membrane and forms a pore structure that the mature protease domain and the \u03b1-protein domain are translocated through the \u03b2-core domain channel into the extracellular space. The mature IgA1 protease is released by self-cleavage at three cleavage sites: a, b, and c (Figure 1) [10,22,23]. In here, only the mature protease domain with or without signal peptide was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The C-terminal His-tagged IgA1 protease domain with the signal peptide (S) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET21a expression vector (using T7 promoter) and pCold IV expression vector (using cold shock promoter, expression occurs at low temperature) (pET-S-IGAN and pCold-S-IGAN) for periplasmic expression. The C-terminal His-tagged IgA1 protease domain only was also amplified by PCR and cloned into pET21a and pCold IV vectors (pET-IGAN and pCold-IGAN) for cytoplasmic expression (Figure 1 and Table 1). pET-S-IGAN and pET-IGAN were first expressed in BL21(DE3) cells induced with 1 mM IPTG at 30 \u2022 C for 3 hours.

                "The serine-type IgA1 protease precursor is composed of four domains: signal peptide, protease domain, \u03b1-protein domain, and \u03b2-core domain. The previous attempts to    produce natural IgA1 proteases from H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitides resulted in a very low titer of total IgA1 proteases. Moreover, the yield of purified IgA1 proteases directly from the cell culture media was low (0.03 and <0.007 mg/L) [23,24]. It has been reported that IgA1 proteases are capable of being expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies or being secreted to the media with reduced activity, or no activity, or in low yield of recovered recombinant IgA1 proteases [25][26][27]. Unlike previous attempts to express recombinant, full-length IgA1 protease precursor in E. coli, our approach was to screen four IgA1 protease constructs (pET-S-IGAN, pET-IGAN, pCold-S-IGAN, and pCold-IGAN) encoding polypeptides comprising the protease domain only (and lacking the \u03b1 protein and \u03b2core domains) in various E. coli strains. Various conditions for the expression of soluble and active IgA1 proteases were used. Our results demonstrated that all four IgA1 protease constructs were able to produce soluble and active IgA1 proteases in several E. coli strains when induced at low temperature and low concentration of IPTG. ELISA as well as activity assay showed that soluble, active IgA1 proteases were expressed in several E. coli strains over a range of culture temperatures and IPTG culture concentration. C41 (DE3) cells transformed with the pET-IGAN construct had the highest titer (approximately 100 mg/L) when induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at 20 \u2022 C. The titer is much higher than the previous report in which it has up to around 2 mg/L [23]. It is possible that the present methods can produce significant amounts of soluble and active IgA1 proteases because the host cells (e.g., E. coli) express only the protease domain and not the full-length precursor protein. Thus, the expressed polypeptide does not need to be cleaved into the mature protease, unlike previous recombinant expressions in H. influenzae and other bacteria. Because the IgA1 protease was expressed as a C-terminal his-tagged form, it was easily purified with much higher yield (20-40 mg/L), which is more than 1000-folds than the highest yield from previous report (0.03 mg/L) [23].",
                "We report, for the first time, the expression of only the IgA1 protease proteolytic domain without the \u03b1 protein domain or the \u03b2-core domain, for recombinant production of soluble and active IgA1 proteases. The protease domain alone was confirmed to have full protease activity. Under optimized conditions, it was also expressed as soluble and active form in E. coli. This method uses E. coli instead of pathogenic bacteria such as H. influenzae, N gonorrhoeae, and N. meningitides. In addition, the significantly increased yield of the IgA1 proteases using the current method allows for production of the IgA1 proteases in amounts useful for administration to treat IgA nephropathy and other IgA1 deposition diseases."
