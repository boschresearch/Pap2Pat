    "abstract": "\u201cVital\u201d dyes such as fluorescein and rose bengal are used clinically to evaluate ocular surface health; however, staining mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that sublethal cell damage stimulates fluorescein dye uptake. Since damage can also stimulate reparative plasma membrane remodeling, we hypothesized that dye uptake occurs via endocytic vesicles. Using an oxidative stress model, we show that damage to relatively undifferentiated monolayer cultures of human corneal epithelial cells stimulates uptake of fluorescein and rose bengal dyes and also stimulates endocytosis. Importantly, dye uptake was blocked by co-treatment with three different endocytosis inhibitors. Damage to stratified and differentiated corneal epithelial cell cultures, which are a better model of the ocular surface, also stimulated dye uptake; however, endocytosis was not stimulated in this case, and two of the inhibitors did not block dye uptake. The exception was the inhibitor Dynasore and its more potent analogue Dyngo-4a, small molecules that target dynamin family GTPases, but also have off-target effects on the plasma membrane. Significantly, while Dynasore blocked stress-stimulated dye uptake at the ocular surface of ex vivo mouse eyes when treatment was performed at the same time as eyes were stressed, it had no effect when used after stress was applied and the ocular surface was already damaged. Thus, Dynasore could not be working by inhibiting endocytosis. Employing cytotoxicity and western blotting assays, we demonstrate an alternative mechanism, showing that Dynasore is remarkably protective of cells and their surface glycocalyx, preventing damage due to oxidative stress, and thus precluding dye entry. These unexpected and novel findings provide greater insight into mechanisms of vital dye uptake and emphasize the importance of using a differentiated cell culture model for such studies. They also suggest that Dynasore and analogues might be used therapeutically to protect the ocular surface and to treat ocular surface disease.",

                "The wet ocular surface comprises the stratified squamous mucosal epithelia of the cornea/conjunctiva and the overlying tear film [1]. These cells are continually renewed in a process whereby daughter cells generated by division of basal cells at the basement membrane are displaced upward in the cell layers, at the same time undergoing terminal differentiation. Cells in the apical cell layer are morphologically and biochemically very different, from cells in the basal layer. As they approach the surface, cells increasingly flatten and begin to express mucosal markers in a polarized manner, including membrane-associated mucins such as MUC16, that emanate from specialized membrane folds on the apical cell layer called microplicae. MUC16 binds multiple oligomers of the galectin LGALS3 to form a highly organized glycocalyx [2]. The glycocalyx, along with the plasma membranes themselves, creates a transcellular barrier to prevent intracellular penetration [2, 3]. Tight junctions seal the space between adjacent cells to create a paracellular barrier, preventing penetration into deeper cell layers [4]. As the apical cells mature further, their surface areas increase, their microplicae flatten, and MUC16 is lost from their surfaces [5]. In addition, the cells become less active metabolically, ultimately being shed in a form of cell death called desquamation [6]. In humans, complete turnover of the ocular surface epithelia occurs in 5\u20137 days [7, 8].",
                "Directly exposed to the external environment, the ocular surface epithelia are subject to damaging agents and physical insults such as ultraviolet light, microorganisms and allergens, that cause ocular surface damage, barrier disruption and increased desquamation [1]. Ocular surface damage is characteristic of dry eye disease (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), a desiccating condition of the ocular surface affecting 20% or more of the population in North America, Europe, and Asia [9]. The most commonly used method for tracking ocular surface damage due to such challenges is staining with water soluble \u201cvital\u201d dyes [10]. Fluorescein was first used clinically in 1882 for evaluation of corneal epithelial defects [11]. Rose bengal use was popularized in the 1930s for dry eye diagnosis because of the distinctive \u201cpunctate\u201d staining pattern observed at the ocular surface of patients [12]. Fluorescein is now used for this purpose as well [13]. Exposure to multipurpose contact lens cleaning solutions (MPS) also causes staining with vital dyes, a recently recognized phenomenon called solution-induced corneal staining (SICS) [14].",
                "Considering the widespread use of vital dyes, it is surprising that the mechanism of staining is still not well understood [13]. Studies published in the early 1990s reported that healthy cells in monolayer culture take up rose bengal [15] and that tear components such as mucins block uptake. Later it was shown that corneal epithelial cells in culture exclude rose bengal autonomously if induced to differentiate and elaborate a mucosal glycocalyx [1]. This suggested that punctate staining with rose bengal in dry eye may represent damage to the glycocalyx barrier of individual cells, allowing dye to penetrate. It also was the first indication that relatively undifferentiated monolayer cell cultures cannot provide a complete model of the ocular surface.",
                "The hydroxyxanthine, fluorescein, is the parent compound from which rose bengal was derived, thus, the two dyes are structurally related [16]. Nevertheless, they differ in cell uptake properties. Living corneal epithelial cells in monolayer culture take up fluorescein in the same way as rose bengal, but at a lower level requiring visualization under epifluorescent illumination [17]. Fluorescein uptake by individual corneal epithelial cells was also observed at the rabbit ocular surface in situ under epifluorescent illumination [18]. In later studies, individual cells in the superficial epithelial layers of the human ocular surface damaged by dry eye were observed to take up fluorescein, described as \u201chyperstaining\u201d [19]. Unlike rose bengal, fluorescein uptake by cells is not blocked by mucins [17], excluding glycocalyx damage as the cause of hyperstaining. This means that the plasma membrane must be the primary barrier to dye penetrance.",
                "Two recent studies used cells in monolayer culture to investigate basic mechanisms of fluorescein uptake [20, 21]. While all cells took up fluorescein at a low level as previously reported [17], a small percentage were observed to concentrate dye, thus standing out as hyperfluorescent. Fluorescein concentration was observed to be an active process, inhibited by reducing the temperature or by killing the cells [21]. Application of a damaging stress [20], or treatment with an MPS [21], greatly increased the number of hyperfluorescent cells. Stressed cells exhibiting high fluorescence intensity also showed characteristics of early apoptosis, whether in monolayer culture, or in the apical epithelial layer of ex vivo rabbit eyes [20]. These findings suggest that fluorescein hyperstaining is an active process of dye concentration in cells that may be compromised, but which are still living.",
                "When the cell surface is compromised, it may respond by activating remodeling processes to repair plasma membrane damage and maintain proteostasis [22\u201325]. We hypothesized that fluorescein dye might be taken up into endocytic vesicles of individual cells undergoing such repair. Here we report our investigation of this idea using undifferentiated human corneal epithelial cells in monolayer culture, stratified and differentiated cultures, and mouse corneas ex vivo, in order to observe the full range of factors that might affect fluorescein uptake, and we include a comparison to rose bengal dye, which enables assessment of cell differentiation."

We hypothesized that stimulation of plasma membrane remodeling by sublethal cell damage would result in vital dye uptake into endocytic repair vesicles. Oxidative stress has been implicated in ocular surface damage due to dry eye [26] and many other ocular surface disorders [27, 28], thus we chose this as the damaging stress for our study. An aqueous stock solution of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) was diluted into the medium of human cell cultures or mouse eye organ cultures as we have previously described [29]. The final dilution of tBHP used for cell culture experiments was 3 mM or 10 mM (as indicated in the individual experimental details). A final dilution of 10 mM tBHP was used for mouse eye organ culture experiments. These optimal concentrations were determined empirically in dose-response assessments as causing a high level of vital dye staining without killing cells. As soon as tBHP was added, all cultures were returned to the cell culture incubator under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stressed cultures were compared to unstressed controls incubated similarly for the same time period. Cells were incubated for 2 to 3 hours and mouse eyes were incubated for 2.5 hours before endpoint determination.",
                        "To learn whether endocytosis was involved in dye uptake, the process was blocked by treating cells or eyes with endocytic inhibitors. Chlorpromazine hydrochloride (MP Biologicals, Solon, OH), an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis [30], was used at a final dilution of 8 ug/mL. Genistein (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), an inhibitor of caveolin-mediated endocytosis [30], was used at 200 uM final dilution. Dynasore hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a GTPase inhibitor that rapidly and reversibly inhibits the activity of dynamin family members involved in both clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis [31], was diluted to a final concentration of 40 uM or 80 uM (as indicated in the individual experimental details). The Dynasore derivative Dyngo-4a (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), a more potent dynamin inhibitor [32], was used at 15 uM final dilution. All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, which served as the treatment vehicle. The same volume of DMSO was added to matching untreated cultures as a vehicle control.",

The cell line was derived from normal tissue and expresses the same mucin gene and keratin repertoire as native epithelia when stimulated to differentiate [33]. For an experiment, cells were plated in 96-well plates and used at 90% confluence as monolayers, or transferred to differentiation medium containing high calcium ion and bovine serum and left for 7 days to stratify and differentiate, as described [33]. Stratification was routinely evaluated using phase contrast microscopy; differentiation leading to glycocalyx barrier function was evaluated using the rose bengal penetration assay.

Rose-bengal dye uptake was essentially the same as fluorescein, with similar numbers of cells showing dye concentration under both unstressed and stressed conditions, as judged by visual inspection (Fig 1A). In agreement with the report of Bakkar and colleagues [20], fluorescein dye uptake (as quantified by plate reader) stimulated by oxidative stress was inhibited to 35% when the culture temperature was reduced to ambient, and to 10% when reduced to 4\u00b0C (data not shown).

The percentage of cells that bound ANXA5 was substantially increased by oxidative stress, as judged by visual inspection (Fig 1B). This agrees with the findings of one of the reference studies [20]. In contrast, only a small number of cells appeared to be in late stage apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay performed at the same time point, and there was little if any difference between unstressed and stressed cells (Fig 1B).

At the end of this time period, eyes were removed from the culture medium and the vital dye staining assay was performed immediately. Application of stress stimulated a significant increase in dye uptake at the ocular surface (Fig 4A). Staining was fairly uniform, unlike dry eye, which manifests as punctate staining of individual cells. However, this type of uniform staining is characteristic of photokeratitis [45]. When eyes were treated with Dynasore at the same time as stress was applied, dye uptake was prevented. These results are consistent with the findings made using cells in culture.",

Nevertheless, we used both a 15-minute and a 30-minute post-treatment period, to ensure that Dynasore had time to work (Fig 4B shows the 30-minute time point).

Applying the trypan blue exclusion assay for plasma membrane damage, we found that staining was greatly increased by application of oxidative stress, again indicative of cell damage. Treatment with Dynasore at the same time as stress was applied was remarkably protective, essentially eliminating trypan blue staining (Fig 5B).",

Jacalin is a lectin that binds to O-linked glycans found on membrane-associated mucins of the ocular surface [42, 43]. Jacalin bound strongly to the ocular surface of unstressed cells, indicative of mucosal differentiation. However, no staining differences were observed between unstressed and stressed cells, and treatment with Dynasore also had no effect (Fig 6A). Thus, if oxidative stress damages the mucin-type glycoconjugates of the glycocalyx, the damage must be subtle and below the level of detectability by this method.",

Levels of genomic DNA in the culture medium remained unaffected, consistent with an increase in LGALS3 shedding from the glycocalyx itself, rather than greater shedding of cells containing LGALS3 on their cell surface.",

                "Vital dyes are commonly used clinically to evaluate health of the ocular surface; however, staining mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that sublethal damage stimulates vital dye uptake by individual living cells. Since cell damage can also stimulate reparative plasma membrane remodeling, we hypothesized that dye uptake occurs via endocytic vesicles. In support of this idea, we show here that application of oxidative stress to relatively undifferentiated monolayer cultures of human corneal epithelial cells stimulates both dye uptake and endocytosis, and that dye uptake is blocked by co-treatment with three different endocytosis inhibitors. Stressing of stratified and differentiated corneal epithelial cell cultures, which are a better model of the ocular surface, also stimulated dye uptake; however, endocytosis was not stimulated, and two of the endocytosis inhibitors did not block dye uptake. The exception was Dynasore and its more potent analogue Dyngo-4a. Significantly, while Dynasore blocked oxidative stress-stimulated dye uptake at the ocular surface of ex vivo mouse eyes when treatment was performed at the same time as eyes were stressed, it had no effect when used after stress was applied and the ocular surface was already damaged. Thus, Dynasore could not be working by inhibiting endocytosis. Employing cytotoxicity and western blotting assays, we went on to demonstrate an alternative mechanism. We found that Dynasore is remarkably protective of cells and their surface glycocalyx, preventing damage due to stress, and thus precluding barrier disruption and dye entry.",
                "Our results emphasize the importance of using stratified and differentiated cell cultures when modelling events at the ocular surface. Human corneal epithelial cells in monolayer culture are relatively undifferentiated, resembling basal cells of the corneal epithelium. However, when these cells are transferred to differentiation medium containing high calcium and left for 7 days, they develop stratified cell mounds that express markers of the mucosal glycocalyx, with the upper cell layer exhibiting a flattened morphology similar to the apical layer of the corneal epithelium [33]. In the current study, we observed differences in the appearance of oxidative stress-stimulated vital dye uptake in monolayer and stratified cells, with no cytoplasmic concentration in the latter. Our finding that oxidative stress does not stimulate endocytosis in stratified and differentiated cell cultures are consistent with the concept that stratified mucosal epithelia such as those of the ocular surface limit endocytosis as part of the barrier function to prevent passage of microbes and foreign antigens [47].",
                "If endocytosis is not the mechanism for oxidative stress-stimulated vital dye uptake by cells at the ocular surface, then what is? A clue is provided by the our results using the trypan blue exclusion assay, which is based on the principle that live cells possess intact cell membranes that exclude certain dyes such as trypan blue, eosin, or propidium, whereas dead cells do not [41]. Recently it was shown that trypan blue staining does not necessarily indicate cell lysis, but may rather indicate pore formation in the cell membranes and more generally increased membrane permeability [48]. Trypan blue has also been shown recently to be a vital dye similar to fluorescein and rose bengal, with potential clinical applications [49]. Oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation of the plasma membrane. Eventually, pore formation can occur [50], creating passages that are not large enough to kill cells, but that allow fluorescein to penetrate. Rose bengal should be excluded by the glycocalyx, but we report evidence here that glycocalyx barrier function is also altered by oxidative stress. This change also appears to be subtle, as it could not be detected by the lectin binding assay, however we did observe an increase in LGALS3 released into the cell culture medium. Dynamins are known to be involved in the conventional secretory pathway [51], however, LGALS3, like other members of the galectin family, lacks both a membrane-anchoring domain and a signal sequence. Instead of being transferred into the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments for classical secretion, LGALS3 is synthesized on clusters of free ribosomes in the cytoplasm of the cell as an non-glycosylated protein before secretion [52, 53]. Thus, it seems unlikely that Dynasore is acting to inhibit LGALS3 secretion. Taken together, the results suggest that no specific mechanism is needed for vital dye uptake; dye may simply enter the oxidative stress-damaged cell more easily because of small breeches in the plasma membrane and glycocalyx barriers. We suggest that the requirement for the cell to be alive for hyperfluorescence may be that active mechanisms are needed to concentrate the dye, and keep it from leaving the cell once it has entered.",
                "A caveat to keep in mind is that we did not test multiple forms of stress in this study, therefore we cannot be entirely certain that findings using the oxidative stress model translate to other forms of stress. However, we note that results of our initial experiments to characterize the oxidative stress model were entirely consistent with those of the Bandamwar reference study that did test multiple forms of stress [20]. Whether SICS involves cell damage is still under debate. MPS characteristically contain a surfactant cleaner such as Tetronic 1107 [54], a biocide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide (which may also have surfactant properties [55]), and a buffering agent. Surfactants dissolve plasma membrane lipids while this may not cause significant toxicity we suggest that barrier function of the plasma membrane may be disrupted sufficiently to allow fluorescein to enter cells more freely. In addition, our group has shown that treatment of stratified and differentiated HCLE cell cultures with different MPS causes an increase in rose bengal staining similar to what we show here for oxidative stress, and we provided evidence for the associated shedding of MUC16 ectodomains [44].",
                "How Dynasore and its analogue Dyngo-4a are so effective in protecting the ocular surface epithelial cells against oxidative stress remains an open and very intriguing question. These compounds were developed to specifically target dynamin family GTPases as an aid for the study of endocytosis [32]; however, other dynamin-dependent effects have been demonstrated. For example, targeting by Dynasore of dynamin family members DNM2 or DRP1 protects cardiomyocyte against entering apoptosis following oxidative stress, by alleviating mitochondrial fragmentation [56\u201358] and blocking inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine expression [59]. Dynasore also has dynamin-independent \u201coff-target\u201d effects on plasma membrane cholesterol, lipid rafts, and actin dynamics [60]. Both of these mechanisms might explain the protective effects of Dynasore on plasma membrane permeabilization and shedding of cell surface glycoproteins due to damaging oxidative stress, and will be important to investigate in future studies. To determine whether dynamin-dependent or -independent mechanisms are involved would require knockdown of individual dynamins, as was done in the cardiomyocyte studies [56\u201359].",
                "After we submitted this manuscript for review, we became aware of a new publication by the same team that conducted one of the studies that served as a reference here [21]. Again, a model of monolayer cells in culture was used to investigate the mechanisms of fluorescein dye uptake in SICS [61]. It was found that MPS-stimulated fluorescein uptake was not associated with apoptosis, unlike the findings of our second reference study that examined damaging stress-stimulated fluorescein uptake [20], confirmed here for oxidative stress. Moreover, fluorescein uptake in cells treated with MPS was not associated with metabolic compromise, as we show here for oxidative stress. The surfactant Tectronic 1107 alone caused the same effects as the effective MPS. Nevertheless, Dynasore inhibited uptake of fluorescein in MPS-treated cells, similar to our findings in the current study using oxidative stress. The authors proposed that dynamin is directly involved in entry of fluorescein into MPS-treated monolayer cells in a mechanism that may involve encapsulation by polymeric micelles and endocytosis. It will be interesting to learn whether this conclusion holds in the stratified and differentiated cell cultures that more closely model the ocular surface.",
                "Dynasore has been proposed as a candidate therapeutic to treat diseases involving abnormal mitochondrial dynamics [62, 63], and our results presented here suggest that it might also be valuable to prevent ocular surface disease. Moreover, while we observed that Dynasore and Dyngo-4a had no effect on vital dye uptake once the damage was done, they would still have value for treatment for ongoing disease. As discussed in the Introduction to this article, the ocular surface epithelia are constantly and rapidly turning over, with new cells rising up in the layers as the apical cells are desquamated. If Dynasore or Dyngo-4a are applied topically over a period of time, the new cells that rise to the surface would be protected. Thus, we predict that chronic ocular surface disease could gradually be resolved by such treatment."
