- prepare OSM alginate beads for in vitro experiments

### In Vivo Variable Inhaled Gas Experiment

- implant OSM-containing beads subcutaneously in rat
- anesthetize rat with isoflurane and oxygen
- measure pO2 and SpO2 during anesthesia
- change inhaled gas from 100% oxygen to room air
- measure pO2 and SpO2 during room air breathing
- switch back to 100% oxygen and measure pO2 and SpO2
- analyze data for oxygen dynamics and transport

### Method of Manufacturing OSMs

- grind up oxygen-sensitive dye into small particles
- mix particles with liquid synthetic or natural material
- polymerize or harden material into gel or solid
- incorporate dye into device through manufacturing methods
- form thin sheet of dye/polystyrene mixture
- break up sheet into fine particles and add to HEMA/PEG mixture
