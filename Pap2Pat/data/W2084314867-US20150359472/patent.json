                        "Disclosed herein are embodiments of microparticles and dyes for continuously measuring oxygen concentrations inside an implant, such as an implantable device, as well as methods of forming the implant having the oxygen sensitive microparticles and/or dyes incorporated within. Thus, the particular oxygen content can be measured within the implant itself, a significant improvement over the current state of oxygen measurement systems. Specifically, to make inner implant oxygen measurements, disclosed herein are embodiments of methods to incorporate oxygen sensitive dyes into the implant material so that the oxygen level can be measured from outside the body with light. While oxygen concentrations are specifically discussed, it will be noted that other environmental conditions, such as pH, CO2 levels, and temperature can also be measured.",
                        "One of the great challenges for creating a successful non-autologous cellular therapy is to provide the new cells in the body with sufficient oxygen and nutrient transfer to survive while protecting them from the immune system. An array of techniques for encapsulating islet cells in alginate have been studied and tested extensively, but ultimately fail within weeks due to, in part, hypoxic conditions.",
                        "Cellular therapies and certain tissue transplants hold promise to replace the implantation of whole organs in the treatment of disease. For most cell types, in vivo viability depends on oxygen delivery to avoid toxic effects of hypoxia. A promising approach is the in situ vascularization of implantable devices which can mediate hypoxia and improve both the lifetime and utility of implanted cells and tissues. While mathematical models and bulk measurements of oxygenation in surrounding tissue have been used to estimate oxygenation within devices, such estimates are insufficient in determining if supplied oxygen is sufficient for the entire thickness of the implanted cells and tissues.",
                        "Previously, tissue pO2 measurements have been taken at the implant site at different time points after the device has been implanted to see whether the oxygen level around the implant is increasing or decreasing. These measurements around the area of the implant may be useful for determining the amount of vascularization around the device, but these measurements may not tell us what the oxygen level is inside the implant. It can be advantageous to know the oxygen level inside the implant because eventually there will be cells loaded inside the implant that will need a certain amount of oxygen to survive. Knowing the amount of oxygen in the implant at different time points may help determine whether or not the implant itself, or the way it is implanted, is providing sufficient oxygen for cell survival. Thus, embodiments of the disclosure allow a user to determine the oxygen levels within an implant.",
                        "There are devices for measuring pO2 levels around the implant but no systems would be able to measure the level of oxygen inside embodiments of the disclosed implant. For example, optical oxygen sensing using luminescent dyes has gained popularity and is used in some commercial fiber-based optical oxygen probes, such as the Ocean Optics NeoFox system, and the PreSens Oxygen Probes (which can be used in biological applications). These devices show that the luminescence-based sensing of oxygen is reliable, but they fall short of being able to measure within implanted materials on small scales and would require a tethered component crossing the skin surface.",
                        "Other technologies exist to measure oxygen levels proximal to an implant non-invasively, but these technologies do not measure oxygen within the device and thus cannot report on the microenvironment of encapsulated tissues. Such technologies include oxygen electrodes either implanted or in contact with skin, or scattered light methods such as diffuse optical spectroscopy (SpO2 measurement) and NIR spectroscopy."

Further, the techniques can be used to measure oxygen concentrations in animal tissue, plants, and microbe cultures.",
                                "Specifically, disclosed herein are embodiments for the direct measurement of oxygen partial pressures within such implanted devices. The disclosed sensors can comprise oxygen-sensitive microparticles (OSMs) and an electro-optical probe to noninvasively, or invasively, excite OSMs and record emitted light from which pO2 can be determined. In some embodiments, the probe can be placed near a patient's skin to irradiate the OSMs and receive their emitted light. In some embodiments, the probe can be placed on a patient's skin to irradiate the OSMs and receive their emitted light. Additionally, disclosed herein is a protocol to measure both the steady state pO2 within devices as well as transport dynamics between the device and the local vasculature.",
                                "Embodiments of the disclosed sensor can have oxygen-sensitive microparticles (OSMs) incorporated into the volume of subcutaneously implantable devices, such as those mentioned above. Oxygen partial pressure within these devices can be measured directly in vivo by an optical probe placed on the skin surface so that light, or radiation, from the optical probe is emitted towards the OSMs.",
                                "In some embodiments, OSMs can be made from an oxygen-sensitive dye embedded within a polystyrene matrix. However, other polymer matrices can be used as well, and the particular matrix is not limiting.",
                                "As validation, OSMs have been incorporated into alginate beads, commonly used as immunoisolation devices to encapsulate pancreatic islet cells. Alginate beads were implanted into the subcutaneous space of Sprague-Dawley rats. Oxygen transport through beads was characterized from dynamic OSM signals in response to changes in inhaled oxygen. Changes in oxygen dynamics over days demonstrate the utility of our technology. A further discussion of this can be found below.",
                                "In some embodiments, the OSMs contain a reporting agent that is a light-sensitive reagent and can include, for example, porphyrin dyes (i.e. platinum tetrabenzo porphyrin), and this porphyrin dye may be used on the sensor. Light, or other radiation, can be emitted from a diode, or other radiation source such as a laser or heater, and then absorbed by a light sensitive dye. The light-sensitive dye is excited by the light source and the light-sensitive dye emits its own radiation, such as fluorescence.",
                                "In some embodiments, the dye can emit a fluorescent signal which can be detected by a sensor. The fluorescent lifetime of the dye can be quenched (e.g. lowered) where more oxygen is present, which can allow for determining the level of perfusion of the device. As the patient can inhale gas with different oxygen compositions (e.g., 100% O2, 80% O2, 60% O2), the rate at which the dye reacts to changes in inhaled gas can correlate with the amount the device is perfused. The quicker the reaction of the dye to changes in inhaled gas indicates a well perfused device, as vasculature carries the gas inhaled, and the more vasculature running through the implant, the quicker the inhaled gas is carried to the implant.",
                                "As mentioned, oxygen may interact with, for example bind with, the light-sensitive dye, thereby quenching fluorescence emissions, thus reducing the intensity and/or decay time of the light. Further, the oxygen can cause, and thus be correlated with, other time-sensitive metrics as well. The fluorescence emitted by the excited porphyrin dye can be collected on a photodetector, potentially through the optical probe, and the intensity and/or decay time of the emitted light can be measured and can be related to the oxygen concentration through a known calibration. For example, the optical data can be sent through a computer, processor, tablet, smartphone, or other device that can translate the optical data to readable data for a user.",
                                "In some embodiments, the probe can be used to continuously read the concentration of oxygen over time. In some embodiments, the probe can be used to make intermittent measurements as desired by a user, such as every minute, hour, or day, though the particular interval is not limiting.",
                                "In some embodiments, the calculated concentration of oxygen from the probe can be sent to a display where the user can interface with the device. The display can be, for example, a video screen, computer screen, mobile device, or tablet, but the particular display is not limiting. In some embodiments, the display can provide for real-time data.",
                                "Following is a list of dyes that could be used for embodiments of the disclosed sensor: metalloporphyrins such as PtOEP, PdOEP, PtTFPP, PdTFPP, PtOEPK, PdOEPK, PtTFPPL, PdTFPPL, PtTPTBP, PdTPTBP, PtTPTBPF, PdTPTBPF, Pt1NF, Pd1NF, Pt2NF, Pd2NF, Pt3NF, Pd3NF, PtTPTNP, PdTPTNP, PtTBP(CO2Bu)8, PdTBP(CO2Bu)8, PtNTBP, PdNTBP, Oxyphor R2, Oxyphor G2, PtTCPP. Additional dyes include but are not limited to cyclometallated complexes such as Ir(III) or Pt(II): Ir(ppy)3, Ir(ppy-NPh2)3, Ir(btpy)3. Additionally, transition metals polypyridyl complexes such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+, [Ru(dpp)3]2+ may also be used as dyes to measure oxygen concentration.",
                                "Following is a list of dyes that allow for the lifetime measurement of temperature which could be used be embodiments of the disclosed sensor, the dyes include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n- - ruthenium tris-1,10-phenanthroline in a poly(acrylo-nitrile) matrix\n  - Ruthenium(II)-tris-(1,10-phenanthroline)-hexafluorophosphate in a\n    poly(acrylo-nitrile) matrix",
                                "Following is a list of dyes that allow for the measurement of CO2 which could be used in embodiments of the disclosed sensor and include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n- - Ruthenium(II)-tris-(4,4 9-diphenyl-2,2\n    9-bipyridyl)-trimethylsilylpropansulfonate.+m-cresolpurple (donor\n    and acceptor dye) in an ethyl cellulose matrix\n  - 1-hydroxypyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonate\n  - 8-hydroxy-pyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate and tetraoctylammonium cation\n    (HPTS(TOA)3) with TOAOH in an ethyl cellulose matrix",
                                "Following is a list of dyes that allow for the measurement of pH which could be used in embodiments of the disclosed sensor and include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\n- - Ruthenium(II)-tris-(4,4 9-diphenyl-2,2\n    9-bipyridyl)-trimethylsilylpropansulfonate+bromthymolblue (donor and\n    acceptor dye) in a polyurethane matrix",
                                "Thus, as shown above, different physiological measurements other than oxygen can be taken inside of an implant, and the particular measurement is not limiting.",
                                "There can be numerous methods for incorporating the OSMs into the implant, and no particular methodology is limiting. For example, in some embodiments the dye can be mixed with alginate or other permeable materials such as Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), polylactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), fibrin, collagen, Hyaluronan (HA), or Hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), etc) which can form into beads which contain the dye. These beads can be incorporated into a permeable implant, for example during the manufacturing process, and thus the implant will be imbedded with a number of OSMs.",
                                "Another way to incorporate the oxygen-sensitive dye into an implant is to load the oxygen sensitive particles into fluidic channels formed in certain implants configured to support vascularization of cells transplanted into fluidic channels within the implants; see e.g., Int'l. Pat. App. No. WO 2014/197798, incorporated herein in its entirety. The channels of the implant will eventually be loaded with cells such as islets, so measuring the oxygen levels within the channels will provide an even more accurate measurement of the oxygen level that the cells will experience. This can be done during the manufacturing of the implant, or after the implant is fully finished. For example, in some embodiments the dye can be added with the cells into the fluidic channel of the device. Upon determination of the perfusion of the implant, it can be determined when the channels are an ideal environment for cells to be housed, and thus cells can be introduced.",
                                "In some embodiments, the oxygen-sensitive dyes can be incorporated by integrating them within materials comprising the device, and not designated channels within. This can be done, for example, during the manufacturing of the implant. For example, as described in below, the dye can be integrated into HEMA, which can be cast or printed into 2D or 3D devices in which the dye is contained within the walls of the device. The dyes can also be incorporated into a thin layer coating surfaces of the device, for example the outer surface or inner features. Therefore, in some embodiments the OSMs may not be used and the dye can be directly incorporated into the implant.",
                                "Experiments, discussed below, were performed on an alginate bead, and its operation was verified in vivo in rats by measuring its response to changing inhaled oxygen concentrations and comparing that response at two time points within the first week of implantation, during which wound healing is most active. The results showed that embodiments of the disclosed techniques track changes in oxygen in implanted alginate beads and that the rate of oxygen transfer to the implanted beads increased during the wound healing process. This link between wound healing and oxygen transport dynamics within the implanted microbeads could have implications for identifying designs that lead to either cell survival or cell death. By knowing the amount of oxygen inside the implants one may be able to correlate that level with critical points in the wound healing process, such as new vessel formation or the identification of areas that have become \u2018walled-off\u2019 from the body.",
                                "Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure have been demonstrated to continuously measure pO2 within implanted alginate microbeads, as a representative example of an implant though other implants could be used as well and optically interrogated using inexpensive optical components coupled to a data acquisition device, such as those used in the art. Microbead pO2 values measured subcutaneously in embodiments of the disclosure (\u02dc45-120 mmHg) were higher than those reported by Veriter and colleagues (\u02dc5-40 mmHg) where larger alginate devices were implanted in a similar manner. This difference can be attributed to differential tissue responses or the accuracy of the sensor. Likely it is due to differential tissue response because it is known that alginate microbeads elicit a moderate tissue response as compared to a slab.",
                                "Embodiments of the disclosure calibrated against known gases had a regression coefficient of R2>0.99 indicating the accuracy of our system.",
                                "In some embodiments, there may be no delay in determining oxygen levels from the implant. In some embodiments, there may be a partially delay in determining oxygen levels in the implant. For example, there are four time scales: (1) the decay time of the dyes in microseconds, (2) the time is takes to compute the oxygen pressure (3) the period between measurements, dictated by the user, (4) the oxygen dynamics between changes in blood and tissue oxygen when inhaled gas is exchanged from one oxygen pressure to another. Time scale 3 is determined by the user while 1 and 4 are not. Time scale 2 is a function of how quickly the light emitted from the dye is analyzed. The decay can be fit to an exponential that is computationally quick. In some embodiments, light intensity can be used, which is faster to compute, but may have some disadvantages as changes in intensity are very sensitive to factors other than oxygen, for example movement. Further, an autocorrelation function can be calculated, which is computationally expensive. However all of these computation times are very fast compared to the time scales of physiology. [0049] Further, in some embodiments, encapsulated islet cells can be added to implants having the disclosed sensor, such as those described in Int'l. Pat. App. No. WO 2014/197798, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and measured oxygen levels can be correlated with implant functionality and cell survival.

                                "Non-autologous tissue transplantation is a promising approach to overcome the scarcity of human pancreas donor tissue in treatment of type 1 diabetes. To this end, a scalable Islet of Langerhans (islet) isolation method has been developed wherein partially digested piglet pancreatic tissue is matured in vitro over 8-days by incubation in a novel cell culture media. During this period exocrine tissue dies and isolated islets remain, which have shown to be responsive to glucose challenges. Isolated islets can be encapsulated within permeable hydrogels, such as alginate, to provide an immuno-protective barrier that may preclude pharmacological immunosuppression. Piglet islets may be isolated and encapsulated within permeable hydrogels such as alginate to provide an immuno-protective barrier that may preclude pharmacological immunosuppression. However, encapsulation devices introduce a transport barrier between the host and graft tissues and inherently limits oxygen supply, compromising graft function and cell viability, problems that scales with device wall thickness.",
                                "Typically grafts are implanted in subcutaneous or intraperitoneal sites where partial pressures of oxygen (pO2) are approximately 60 mmHg and 40 mmHg respectively, which is lower than arterial blood (>80 mmHg). It is commonly asserted that low cell viability within devices results from low tissue oxygen taken together with device diffusional barriers to create hypoxic and anoxic conditions, where these conditions are known to promote cell death through necrosis and apoptosis. However, direct measurement of oxygen levels within micro-encapsulated devices in vivo has not been previously reported, where such measurements are ultimately required to assay the efficacy of implant technologies that claim to promote oxygen delivery. In a study of relatively large alginate disc implants (1-1.5 cm2 surface area at 3-6 mm thick), oxygen within implanted devices was directly measured through the use of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry in rats. However, current research shows that such thick devices cannot retain islet function, likely due to diffusional limitations, thus promoting microencapsulation technologies such as thin sheets or microbeads of permeable materials."

Such an assay can be advantageous since it captures effects of both increase/decrease of local vasculature resulting from the implantation wound and subsequent healing as well as the deposition of new collagenous tissue, which forms an additional diffusional barrier. Inhaled gas is rapidly changed as pO2 and SpO2 are monitored. Oxygen dynamics after each gas change are governed by tissue architecture, with rise/fall times increasing or decreasing as the local tissue rejects or perfuses the implant respectively.",
                                "For these tests using embodiments of the disclosed sensor, the 100% oxygen+isoflurane inhaled gas was transiently exchanged with room air (21% oxygen)+isoflurane and then returned to 100% oxygen+isoflurane. OSMs were probed every 10 seconds. Measurements were recorded on days five and nine post implantation.",
                                "FIG. 6 shows a typical variable inhaled gas experiment at day 5. pO2 and SpO2 exhibited dynamics in the early stages of anesthesia (first 30 minutes) and eventually reached a steady when breathing the 100% gas mixture. This phenomena was common to most experiments and is likely due to the physiological effects of isoflurane. The gas was changed to the room air mixture for \u02dc10 minutes and then returned to the 100% O2 mixture for \u02dc25 min. pO2 within beads did not reach steady state within the 10 minutes of room air, but did within the 25 min of 100% O2. Similar results were observed for the second room air challenge beginning at \u02dc72 minutes.",
                                "On day 5, SpO2 and pO2 within capsules consistently exhibit dynamics after the initiation of anesthesia, stabilizing after approximately 30 minutes. At 37 minutes the percent oxygen mixed with isoflurane was changed from 100% to 21% for 11 minutes and then switched back. The same exchange in inhaled gas is repeated 26 minutes later.",
                                "The variable inhaled gas experiment was repeated for the same rate on day 9 (FIG. 7). Here pO2 reaches steady state within the \u02dc10 minutes of room air gas indicating rapid O2 exchange between the beads and tissue as compared to day 5, an effect most likely mediated by tissue remodeling around the implant. As shown in FIG. 7, on day 9 pO2 within capsules more rapidly moves towards a steady state (as compared to day 5) following the gas exchange.",

The oxygen measured by the beads correlates with oxygen reported by a pulse-oximeter SpO2 (dashed lines) when the rat breaths either 100% oxygen or 21% oxygen (room air). There is a delay due to physiologic differences in oxygen transport between arterial blood (pulse-ox SpO2) and oxygen in the interstitial space where the sensor beads are implanted (bead pO2).",

Accordingly, the only way for oxygen to enter the channels was through diffusion. Oxygen within the outside solution passes through the hydrogel via diffusion, entering the channels within the device, where the dye within the channels detect oxygen and have their fluorescent lifetime quenched.",

There is no oxygen-sensitive response as expected because the dye has not been incorporated.",

First, room are was added into the PBS solution, followed by about 5 minutes of Argon gas, followed by about 10.5 minutes of room air. As shown, the lifetime fluorescence of the oxygen dye fluctuated based on the oxygen that entered into the system. The changes in oxygen were quickly detected, as the moment the gases were switched, the sensor detected the change in fluorescence lifetime.",

The injected dye was mixed with 1\u00d7PBS into the channels of the device, and the channels were sealed. A small incision was made on the dorsal skin of the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rate, where the device was implanted in the subcutaneous region adjacent the rodent's spine. Once implanted, the incision was stapled or sutured shut.",

The rodent was breathing 100% oxygen initially, but changed to 60% oxygen at about 5 minutes, then back to 100% oxygen at about 12.5 minutes. As shown in FIG. 10, there are no dye dynamics detected. The vessels are still far from the implant, and there isn't enough vasculature invading the slit at this point because the wound is still healing. So applying changes to the amount of oxygen that the rodent is inhaling will not be detected by the dye because there is not enough vasculature in the slits of the device to carry oxygen that the dye will detect.",
                                "On the other hand FIG. 11 illustrates a day 10 post implant, with the sensor placed in the same position as in day 3. The rodent was initially breathing 100% oxygen, was changed to 60% oxygen at minute 3.5, and back to 100% oxygen at minute 9. As shown in FIG. 11, a dye dynamic correlating with the time at which a change in oxygen concentration that the rodent was inhaling occurred is detected. This indicates that the slits are vascularized and that the oxygen from this vasculature is diffusing through the walls of our device, into the channels of our device, where they are being detected by the dye housed within those same channels. A small change in lifetime may indicate arterial blood is near-by.",

As above, the polymerized dye mixture was crushed into small particles, then the particles were mixed with a liquid HEMA/PEG mixture and the mixture was shaken with a vortex to disperse the particles throughout. Next, the dye/HEMA mixture was deposited onto a glass slide and polymerized. Measurements of pO2 were then obtained by probing the particles that now lie in the Polymerized HEMA gel.",

By exciting the dye particles with light and measuring their emitted light's lifetime decay as different concentrations of oxygen in calibrated gas mixtures was flowed over the cured HEMA/dye mixture, a calibration of dye lifetime values to oxygen concentrations could be made, as shown in FIG. 12.",
