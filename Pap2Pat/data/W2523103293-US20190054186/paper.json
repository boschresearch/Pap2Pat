    "title": "Remote Actuation of Magnetic Nanoparticles For Cancer Cell Selective Treatment Through Cytoskeletal Disruption",
    "date": "2016-09-20",
    "abstract": "Motion of micron and sub-micron size magnetic particles in alternating magnetic fields can activate mechanosensitive cellular functions or physically destruct cancer cells. However, such effects are usually observed with relatively large magnetic particles (>250 nm) that would be difficult if at all possible to deliver to remote sites in the body to treat disease. Here we show a completely new mechanism of selective toxicity of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNP) of 7 to 8 nm in diameter to cancer cells. These particles are coated by block copolymers, which facilitates their entry into the cells and clustering in the lysosomes, where they are then magneto-mechanically actuated by remotely applied alternating current (AC) magnetic fields of very low frequency (50 Hz). Such fields and treatments are safe for surrounding tissues but produce cytoskeletal disruption and subsequent death of cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.",

                        "A series of block copolymers with a polyanion block and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was synthesized to evaluate the effect of polymer coating composition on the polymer-SMNP complexes\u2019 uptake in cancer cells. The polyanion block was either polyacrylic acid (PAA) or polymethacrylic acid (PMA), which differ in their hydrophobicity. The more hydrophobic PMA was expected to interact better with the hydrophobic cell membrane and improve particle uptake. Another strategy to improve the internalization of polymer coated SMNPs was incorporation of Pluronic P85 (P85) into the polymer coating. P85 effectively accumulated in the cells across all the cell lines tested as was analyzed by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S2) and confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3). Representative confocal microscopy images of BT474 and MDA-MB-231 indicate that in both cell lines P85 preferentially accumulates in lysosomes (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Due to this favorable uptake pattern, P85 was incorporated in the polymer coatings of several of our tested SMNP-complexes by complexation of SMNPs with a PAA-b-P85-b-PAA pentablock copolymer. The physicochemical characteristics of the formed polymer-SMNP complexes are summarized in Table S1. The intensity average hydrodynamic diameters (Di) of the polymer-SMNP complexes were in the range of 30\u201370\u2009nm with \u03b6-potential values of \u221235 to \u221250\u2009mV. The polymer content in all the complexes was around 60\u2009wt% as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and this was in excellent agreement with the iron concentration measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). All the polymer-SMNP complexes were small clusters with several SMNP cores incorporated together as observed by TEM (Supplementary Fig. S4).",
                        "All the polymer-SMNP complexes were stable in aqueous dispersion for over 48\u2009hours under different ionic environments (deionized (DI) water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and complete media) (Supplementary Fig. 5S). The saturation magnetization values of all the clusters were in the 60\u201370\u2009A m2/kg Fe3O4 range (Supplementary Fig. S6). Preliminary cytotoxicity studies showed that all tested polymer-SMNP complexes were minimally toxic in MDA-MB-231, BT474 and MCF10A cells at all tested concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S7).",
                        "Internalization of the polymer-SMNP complexes was evaluated following 1\u2009h and 24\u2009h of incubation and was determined by the amount of Fe/mg protein in the cells (Fig. 1a). All polymer-SMNP complexes showed time and concentration dependent uptake in all experimental cell lines. PMA-PEG-SMNP showed slightly enhanced uptake compared to PAA-PEG-SMNP, especially in BT474 cells but these differences were not statistically significant. Incorporation of P85, with its relatively hydrophobic central block, into the polymer chain effectively promoted internalization of the PAA-P85-SMNPs. Interestingly, this effect of PAA-P85 was lost when PAA-P85 was mixed with PAA-PEG in the PAA-PEG/PAA-P85 blend coated SMNP. Comparable accumulation of PAA-P85-SMNP was observed in BT474 and MCF10A cells after 24\u2009h while uptake in MDA-MB-231 was lower (Fig. 1b). Due to significantly higher uptake the following studies focused exclusively on the PAA-P85-SMNP complexes."

                        "Intracellular distributions of the PAA-P85-SMNP complexes were studied by confocal microscopy in MDA-MB-231, BT474 and MCF10A cells. For this experiment, the nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue), lysosomes were labeled with Lysotracker Green and the PAA-P85-SMNPs were labeled with Alexa Fluor\u00ae647 (red). The overlap of the Lysotracker and SMNP labels indicates colocalization. Our preliminary studies suggested that the intracellular localization of the PAA-P85-SMNPs varied at different dose concentrations. Therefore, this study dosed with both a low (0.05\u2009mg/mL or 0.1\u2009mg/mL) and high (0.5\u2009mg/mL) concentration. Figure 2(a\u2013c) shows representative confocal images of intracellular distributions of Alexa Fluor\u00ae647-PAA-P85-SMNP complexes following incubation for 24\u2009h. As can be seen at the low concentration of 0.05\u2009mg/mL, PAA-P85-SMNP complexes are accumulated in lysosomes, while at the high concentration of 0.5\u2009mg/mL the PAA-P85-SMNPs also spread throughout the cytoplasm. These observations are further confirmed by the colocalization quantitative data shown in Fig. 2d. This data shows that in all three cell lines colocalization of the polymer-SMNP complexes with lysosomes remains quite high (80%) at low exposure concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1\u2009mg/mL, but drops off significantly to about 30% at the high exposure concentration of 0.5\u2009mg/mL. Figure 2e shows TEM data of PAA-P85-SMNPs in cells to further confirm high amounts of lysosomal accumulation."

                        "A remarkable difference in the response of cancerous (MDA-MB-231 and BT474) versus non-cancerous (MCF10A) cells was observed. There was a significant reduction in cell viability at as low as 0.05\u2009mg/mL of PAA-P85-SMNPs in both MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3a) and BT474 cells (Fig. 3b) regardless of the field exposure regime utilized. However, as seen in Fig. 3c, despite similar internalization rates and SMNP concentration inside the MCF10A cells there was no noticeable decrease in cell viability after AC magnetic field exposure (all tested regimes). For the cancerous MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells, the effect on cell viability did not occur in a dose dependent manner and was not enhanced with increased field strength. Interestingly, in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, field exposure using the continuous field regime caused little toxicity up to 0.25\u2009mg/mL PAA-P85-SMNP complexes while in the BT474 cells, this same exposure regime caused a 50% decrease in cell viability following incubation with only 0.05\u2009mg/mL PAA-P85-SMNP complexes. However, in both cell lines, the pulsed field regime was significantly more effective compared to the continuous field regime (50% for pulsed versus 100% cell viability for continuous field in MDA-MB-231 and 25% for pulsed versus 50% cell viability for continuous field in BT474). Exposure of the cells in the absence of PAA-P85-SMNPs to either a continuous or pulsed field regime remained minimally toxic for both cell lines. Cell viability after exposure to 0.5\u2009mg/mL SMNPs was assessed but did not yield any higher efficacy in any of the cell lines. Due to these results, further experiments were done using a 50\u2009kA/m field strength and the pulsed field regime.",
                        "These results show that the BT474 cells are more sensitive to the treatment than the MDA-MB-231 cells, and the healthy MCF10A cells do not seem to be affected at all. To further determine a mechanistic understanding of this observation, we first needed to determine if lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) or cellular heating was responsible for the observed cell death. It has been determined, based upon our previous experimental results as well as theoretical calculations, that the observed effects cannot be explained by bulk or surface heat16. Previously we have clearly shown that exposure of PAA-P85-SMNP dispersions to super low frequency AC magnetic fields does not result in a temperature increase of the surrounding medium, and that changes in the physical structure of a conjugated enzyme were significantly different from a temperature-induced structural deformation16. Thus, we can conclude that the cell death observations are not due to heating effects.",
                        "Previous studies have indicated that exposure of cells to alternating current magnetic fields can result in mechanical disruption of the lysosomes resulting in LMP and subsequent death through these lysosomal pathways121314. To evaluate if a similar phenomenon was occurring in our system, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-PAA-P85-SMNP and Lysotracker Green and exposed to the 50\u2009kA/m, 50\u2009Hz field using the pulsed field regime. Disruption of lysosomes would result in leakage of the acidic content as well as of Lysotracker Green resulting in loss of punctate fluorescence. Confocal images showed no evidence of lysosomal disruption (Supplementary Fig. S8) in any of the cell lines. Lysotracker Green remained colocalized with Alexa Fluor\u00ae647-PAA-P85-SMNPs without a noticeable decrease in Lysotracker Green fluorescence in all cell lines.",
                        "An acridine orange assay, a more robust method to detect LMP, was also conducted. Acridine orange is a lysosomotropic stain that can be used to measure the lysosome membrane functionality. The stain is excited by UV light and emits red/orange fluorescence when in lysosomes and green fluorescence when present in the nucleus or cytosol. Cells with intact lysosomes display punctate red/orange fluorescence but this red/orange fluorescence reduces significantly after LMP181920. Hydrogen peroxide was used as a positive control because it is known to induce LMP21. Figure 4 shows that SMNP incubation along with pulsed field exposure does not cause loss of lysosomal fluorescence as observed in the positive hydrogen peroxide control. The lysosomes retain the punctate red/orange fluorescence before and after field exposure in all three cell lines, which indicates a lack of LMP.",
                        "Once heating and LMP were eliminated as potential explanations for our observations, we looked to the differing cytoskeletal architectures of the cell lines for a mechanism. Cytoskeletal damage as a cause of cell death has been well reported in the literature. Actin filaments are one of the main components involved in maintaining cell structure as well as assisting with transport of organelles and vesicles throughout the cell. Previous research has shown that interference with cytoskeletal components can cause cessation of the cell cycle and lead to apoptosis2223. Lysosomes are anchored to microtubule highways and highly associated with actin filaments. The hypothesis for this system is that the PAA-P85-SMNPs accumulate in lysosomes and upon remote actuation by the AC magnetic field can rotate inside of the lysosome, thus inducing torques and shear stresses on the underlying cytoskeleton, all without causing lysosomal leakage. A schematic of this event progression is depicted in Fig. 5. The cytoskeleton in cancerous cells is more sensitive to mechano-transduction leading to subsequent damage and cell death. Thus, it is suggested that while the generated forces are insufficient to cause damage to the underlying cytoskeleton of the stiffer, benign cells, less mechanical force is required to cause cytoskeletal deformation to the cytoskeleton of cancerous cells242526.",
                        "The theory of actin damage as the cause of cell death was studied by first determining the effect of the AC magnetic field on actin structure using confocal microscopy (Fig. 6). MDA-MB-231 and BT474 control cells show an actin filament structure very typical of cancer cells while the nontumorigenic MCF10A cells show actin structures very typical of healthy epithelial cells. Following exposure to 0.1\u2009mg/mL of Alexa Fluor647\u00ae labeled PAA-P85-SMNPs and a pulsed 50\u2009Hz, 50\u2009kA/m AC magnetic field, the confocal images revealed significant disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in the cancerous MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells but not in the nontumorigenic MCF10A cells (Fig. 6 left panel). This is in excellent agreement with the previously discussed cytotoxicity data (Fig. 3). To further test the correlation between the mechanical properties of the cells and treatment effects, the cells were incubated with Cytochalasin D (CD). CD disrupts actin polymerization and in sub-lethal doses decreases the mechanical stiffness of cells (as measured by Atomic Force Microscopy). Therefore, exposure of non-cancerous cells to CD reduces their stiffness to the levels comparable to cancer cells25. Notably after exposure to CD and SMNPs the pulsed AC magnetic field regime enacts significant cytoskeletal damage in MCF10A cells as can be seen in the insert of Fig. 6c. The damage is comparable to the damage observed in the cancerous cells following exposure to the SMNPs and pulsed AC magnetic field (Fig. 6a,b). No significant differences in the cytoskeleton structure were observed in cancerous cells incubated with CD alone following exposure to a pulsed AC magnetic field.",
                        "Cell viability data confirmed these observations. Addition of CD to SMNP exposed MCF10A cells sensitizes them to both the continuous and pulsed AC magnetic field regimes (Fig. 6 right panel). The MCF10A cell viability decreased to 25% following exposure to the 50\u2009Hz, 50\u2009kA/m AC field. It was also interesting to see that CD appeared to sensitize the cancer cells to forces created by the SMNP in the continuous field regime.",
                        "The proposed mechanism of mechanical disruption of the cytoskeleton is in very good agreement with the differences in cytotoxicity observed for MDA-MB-231 cells versus BT474 cells. BT474 cells grow in multilayer colonies and their complex cytoskeletal structure is very important to their growth. Interestingly, we have observed colocalization of PAA-P85-SMNPs with the basal cells rather than in the top layer (Supplementary Figs S9 and S10). It may be that when the cytoskeletons of the basal cells in the colony are compromised, this causes a subsequent loss to the apical cells in the colony as well which results in the lower cell viability we observed in Fig. 3."

                "We observed a new mechanism of toxicity of SMNPs in non-heating super low frequency AC magnetic fields to cancerous cells that involves cytoskeletal disruption, and it can be selectively enacted upon cancerous cells while leaving healthy cells intact. The selective cytotoxic effect was dependent on the cell mechanical properties rather than on intracellular uptake disparities between cancerous and healthy cells reported elsewhere141527. Notably, cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines differ in mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. Cancerous cells are mechanically softer than their benign counterparts due to their need to remodel during transformation and metastasis24. For example, the Young\u2019s moduli of malignant MDA-MB-231 cells are less than half those of non-malignant MCF10A cells28. It has previously been shown that SMNPs conjugated to signaling proteins can control the assembly of cytoskeletal components such as microtubules in an applied magnetic field2930. It was also shown that SMNPs under AC magnetic fields can form linear aggregates831. In addition, the theory suggests that in high frequency gradient magnetic fields, SMNPs can also oscillate mechanically and produce ultrasound waves32. According to this theory forces generated by an assembly of SMNPs, such as those observed here in lysosomes, are sufficient to induce cellular responses32. However, our experiments were carried out in the absence of the magnetic field gradient, using at least 1/10 of the field amplitude and nearly 104 lower field frequencies than those predicted to generate the ultrasound waves32. Therefore, we believe that we may observe a different effect.",
                "We have previously reported that exposure to an AC field can cause mechanical movement of SMNPs, which generates stress forces and deformation of the surrounding polymer coating and attached biological molecules33. In one study, the aggregates of PAA-PEG coated SMNPs with enzymes conjugated to the PAA chains were reported to denature the enzyme in the AC field without heating16. The estimates of the forces for the AC fields used herein (50\u2009Hz, 50 to 100\u2009kA/m) suggest that the movement of individual magnetite particles of ~7\u20138\u2009nm in diameter is unlikely to induce forces high enough to generate biological responses (see force estimates in the Supplementary information). However, these fields can produce forces ranging from several dozen to ~300\u2009pN, if single particles form aggregates with a greater net magnetic moment. Such forces may exceed the strength of the filaments in the cells and result in their damage34. The literature states that actin-actin bonds will break at 600\u2009pN under straight pulling and at 320\u2009pN under twisting forces35. Notably, these estimates of strength were obtained with a monotonously increasing load applied to the filaments as a whole. The aggregates of the SMNPs accumulated in lysosomes can actually affect filaments locally and multiple times (~3\u00b7104 loading cycles during 10\u2009min at 50\u2009Hz AC field). It is well known that due to fatigue dynamic strength of the materials is 3\u20134 times lower than their static strength.",
                "Interestingly we did not observe permeabilization of lysosomes in contrast to Zhang et al. who described the use of a rotating magnetic field to rotate particles, mostly within lysosomes (and attached to the lysosome membranes)9. Therefore, we believe that there are major differences in both mechanism and result from the work of Zhang et al. The present work does not invoke rotating fields and importantly the particle size ~7\u20138\u2009nm is at least an order of magnitude less than that of Zhang et al. (they used particles of 100\u2009nm and more). Such small particles aggregate within the lysosomes upon internalization in the cells. Each lysosome may contain from several hundred to several thousands of particles, which is not surprising since we estimate that each cell takes up from ~105 to ~106 particles (see Supplementary information). The pentablock copolymer coating of the particles may be very important since upon the accumulation of the particles in the lysosomes their hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) chains of P85 may interact with each other (alike formation of Pluronic micelles). This should lead to a formation of a dense physical nanogel SMNP-polymer network. Moreover, poly(propylene oxide) chains may also form multiple \u201canchors\u201d to the lysosome membrane (see ref. 36 for review of Pluronic interactions with cell membranes). As a result the giant SMNPs aggregates and the surrounding lysosomes would move as a whole with much of the load affecting their points of attachment to the actin filaments and only relatively little stress produced upon the lysosomal membranes (Fig. 7).",
                "Notably, effects of the continuous AC magnetic field depend more specifically on the SMNP concentration inside the cells and lysosomes while exposure to the pulsed AC magnetic field generates more cell damage at each tested concentration. The exposure to CD sensitizes the cancerous cells to a continuous AC magnetic field, suggesting that less force is generated by continuous exposure. This difference between exposure to continuous and pulsed AC magnetic fields might be due to the fact that following the application of force, stress-relaxation processes can occur in the cells. Connord et al. reported that during the AC field application (300\u2009kHz, 53\u2009mT) lysosomes containing magnetite nanoparticles of nearly same size as in the present work can align within cells in needle-like structures along the direction of the field13. Once the field is switched off the lysosomes disassemble. Assembling and disassembling occurs during minutes, i.e. same time scale as the on/off field exposures in the present work. So it is likely that similar assembling/disassembling can also proceed in the conditions of our experiment. At lower frequencies, such 50\u2009Hz AC field the alignment of magnetite-loaded lysosome is even more likely. In this case the rupture of the cytoskeleton may take place in the areas of greatest stress due to a combination of strain and torque. (The torque produced by AC field appears to be essential, since no toxicity was observed upon repeated exposure of cancer cells to DC field.) Once the lysosomes disassemble the strain is released, but when the field is applied again the assembly of the lysosomes may cause stress in the new areas of the cytoskeleton."
