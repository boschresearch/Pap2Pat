                        "The ongoing second quantum revolution calls for exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics in transformative new technologies for computation and quantum information science (QIS) applications (1). Spin-qubits based on solid-state defects have emerged as promising candidates because these qubits can be initialized, selectively controlled, and readout with high fidelity at ambient temperatures (2)(3). Solid-state defects offer advantages of scalability and ease of device fabrication. Point defects as spin qubits have been demonstrated in traditional semiconductor systems (4), including the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) center in diamond and the spin-1/2 defect in doped silicon (3)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10), among other possibilities (4)(11)(12)(13). In particular, Si-vacancy complex in diamond (14), vacancy defects in SiC (15)(16), and vacancy complexes in AIN (12) have been predicted as qubits. A neutral divacancy (Vc-Vsi)0 in SiC has been identified as a qubit with millisecond coherence time (17), where an improvement in dephasing time by over four orders of magnitude can be achieved by embedding the qubit in a decoherence-protected subspace through microwave dressing (18).",
                        "A key challenge in the development of controllable multiple-qubit systems is how to effectively couple spin defects and achieve high fidelity and long coherence times. The planar structures of atomically-thin 2D materials present a superior platform for realizing controlled creation and manipulation of defect qubits with better potential for scalability than the bulk materials. In 2D materials, defects can be generated by a number of existing approaches (19), and characterized and manipulated using atomic-level scanning probe techniques (20). The carbon-vacancy complex (CB-VN) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as the first such qubit (21), (22). Nitrogen vacancy complex defect (NB-VN) and the negatively charged boron vacancy defect (VB) have also been proposed as qubit candidates in h-BN (23) (24) (25), and a number of point defects in h-BN show promise as ultra-bright single-photon emitters at room temperature (26) (27).",
                        "TMDs are a major class of 2D graphene cognates that are attracting intense current interest because of their sizable band gaps and high absorption coefficients, among other unique physical and chemical properties. Atomic defects in as-grown TMD samples, such as the anion vacancies (28), are well known to play an essential role in their electronic behavior (29). Compared to 3D wide-band-gap materials, the spin coherence time in MoS2 has been estimated to be extremely long, on the order of 30 ms, suggesting the potential of TMDs as good host materials for multiple-qubit operation (30).",
                        "There is, therefore, a need for the discovery and rational design of novel defect qubits in 2D materials and their implementation in single- and multi-qubit platforms for QIS applications."

Here we show that the antisite defect in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can provide a controllable solid-state spin qubit system. Using high-throughput atomistic simulations, we identify several neutral antisite defects in TMDs that lie deep in the bulk bandgap and host a paramagnetic triplet ground state. Our in-depth analysis reveals the presence of optical transitions and triplet-singlet intersystem crossing processes for fingerprinting these defect qubits. As an illustrative example, we discuss the initialization and readout principles of an antisite qubit in WS2, which is expected to be stable against interlayer interactions in a bilayer structure for qubit isolation and protection in future qubit based devices. Our study opens a new pathway for creating scalable, room-temperature spin qubits in 2D TMDs.",

Our first-principles defect computations, see the Methods section below for details, demonstrate that the proposed antisites in these TMDs host paramagnetic triplet ground states with flexible level splittings controlled by site symmetries and both the in-plane and out-of-plane d orbital interactions. Taking Ws antisite in WS2 as an especially viable case, we demonstrate a viable transition loop between the triplet and singlet defect states, including optical excitations/relaxations and nonradiative decay paths for the Ws antisite as a qubit.

(a) A paramagnetic, long-lived triplet ground state with multiple in-gap defect levels. (b) An optical transition path between the ground and excited triplet states as well as a spin-selective (nonradiative) decay path between the different spin-multiplet states for qubit initialization. And, (c) distinguishable luminescence signatures for the two spin sublevels for qubit readout (4).",
                                "Before we turn to discuss how the interplay of the host electronic structure and local site symmetry yields an anion antisite in the TMDs as a viable defect qubit, we note that wide bandgap compounds, such as SiC, AlN, and h-BN, are mostly characterized by occupied anion states as valence bands and unoccupied cation states as conduction bands. As a result, cation (anion) vacancy defect levels originate from anion (cation) dangling-bond states that are usually located in the valence (conduction) band. Therefore, it becomes necessary to introduce impurities next to the vacancies (4) or apply strain perturbations (12) in the wide-band-gap systems to create additional energy splittings to push the defect levels into the gap. Monolayer group-VI TMDs possess fundamentally different electronic structures that are characterized by dominant d-state contributions to both the conduction and valence band edges, so that point defects created by the cations such as the anion antisites and anion vacancies/complexes are more likely to host deep in-gap defect levels. Notably, intrinsic defects including vacancies and anion antisites have been observed experimentally in the TMDs (31).",
                                "It is useful to recall here that a triplet ground state is preferred (Hund's rule) when the exchange energy involving the interaction of two parallel spins is favorable compared to the energy required to lift one of the electrons to a higher level. In other words, a small energy splitting between the two highest occupied levels is a prerequisite for stabilizing the triplet ground state. An energetically favorable scenario is that the local site-symmetry of the point defect belongs to a point group with at least one 2-dimensional (2D) irreducible representation (IRREP). The 2D IRREP may generate doubly degenerate defect levels and hence a strong tendency to create a triplet ground state when these two levels are the highest occupied levels as is the case for the NV center in diamond. d states of transition metal cations in TMDs tend to have relatively large exchange energies, which favors a triplet ground state in keeping with the Hund's rule."

                                "Based on the preceding discussion of our hypothesis, we performed a symmetry-based data-mining search to identify nonmagnetic and relatively stable MX2 TMD compounds from the 2D materials database C2DB (32) with computed band gaps larger than 1.4 eV and energies above the convex hull less than 0.1 eV/atom. 27 TMD compounds are identified and assigned to three different phases, 2H, 1T, and 1T\u2019 and the corresponding point groups, D3h, D3d, and C2h, respectively. 1T\u2019 phase is ruled out since the C2h point group does not have a 2D IRREP. For group-VI TMDs, the 2H phase is more stable than the 1T phase under equilibrium conditions (33). Therefore, we focus on six nonmagnetic group-VI 2H TMDs MX2 (M: Mo, W; X: S, Se, Te). We performed high-throughput defect computations and the results and found that no anion vacancy in group-VI TMDs hosts a triplet ground state, which is partly due to the fact that cation dangling bond states are high in the conduction band. We thus ruled out isolated anion vacancies and focused on anion antisite defects in the 2H TMDs.",
                                "FIG. 1A presents an example of an anion antisite in TMDs where a cation is located on an anion site in the crystal lattice. The location and occupation of defect levels created by the antisite are controlled by its interaction with the three cation atoms in the central atomic layer as well as the defect charge state (see Methods). Defect levels of six anion antisites MX0 in the band gaps of 2H-MX 2 (M: Mo, W; X: S, Se, Te) were computed and those of the neutral antisites are shown in FIG. 1B. It is remarkable that all the six 2H TMDs host neutral antisites in a triplet ground state. Note that it has been predicted that anion antisite in WS2 (34) and MoS2 (35) favors a triplet state. In spite of the universal presence of triplet ground state in six antisite systems, we emphasize that the level splittings for the three defect levels in the spin-up channel are not universal (FIG. 1B). Constructed mainly from dx-y, dxy, and dzorbitals of the cation atoms located at the antisites, the three defect levels of the six 2H TMDs fall into two level-splitting patterns characterized by the position of the dzlevel relative to the dx-yand dxy levels. For the neutral antisites in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, the two highest occupied levels in the gap are doubly degenerate, while those in MoTe2 and WTe2 generate three discrete defect levels in the band gaps of the host material.",

The bars represent the valence 110 and conduction 115 bands of the host materials. Note that MS/Se0 has doubly degenerate highest-occupied defect levels, whereas in the case of MTe0 there is a splitting between the occupied defect levels. FIG. 1C is a schematic diagram illustrating correlation between the defect-level splittings and the z-positions of the antisites relative to those of the neighboring cations. Lines 120 mark the equilibrium z positions of antisite defects, while the lines 125 indicate the critical z positions where a transition from the 2-1 type splitting (bars 130) to the 1-2 type splitting (bars 135) takes place. FIG. 1D is a schematic diagram illustrating thermodynamical transition levels for the six antisite defects in 2H-TMDs. \u03f5(+/0) and \u03f5(0/\u2212) denote the transition level from the charge state +1 to 0, and from 0 to \u22121, respectively. Neutral charge states are thermodynamically stable when the Fermi level is close to the mid-gap.",
                                "In order to gain insight into the differences in defect level-splittings in various 2H TMDs, we adopt a local-symmetry analysis. The local symmetry for the unperturbed environment of an antisite is C3v which is a subgroup of the crystal point group D3h of pristine 2H-MX2 systems. In 2H-MX2 compounds, the d orbitals hybridize and transform into 2D IRREP E and 1D IRREP A1. Within this local symmetry, dx-yand dxy orbitals at the antisites belong to the 2D IRREP E while the dzorbital belongs to the 1D IRREP A1. The doubly degenerate dx-yand dxi orbitals at the antisites interact with the three neighboring cations mainly in the x-y plane. Their energy levels are therefore affected by the M-M distances or the lattice constants. On the other hand, the interaction between the Dzorbitals of the antisites and the three cations is determined by the location of the antisite defect along the z-direction relative to the cation layer.",
                                "Our analysis indicates that, due to differences in orbital interactions, the Dzdefect level shifts up in energy relative to the dx-yand dxy levels as the antisite moves away from the cation layer along the z-direction. This relative shift in energies eventually reaches a critical point where the level switching takes place. However, as shown in FIG. 1C, position of the antisite along the z-direction in equilibrium structure (lines 120) is negatively correlated with the lattice constant. Due to differences in the critical z-positions (lines 125), where the levels undergo switching, two level-splitting patterns emerge depending on the lattice constants of the host materials. Since the lattice constants of the six 2H TMDs are mainly determined by anion species, we see a clear correlation between the level-splitting pattern and anion species. For antisites in MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, the dx-yand dxy levels are located below the dzlevel (2/1 splitting), while opposite is the case for MoTe2 and WTe2 (1/2 splitting).",
                                "Determined by the charge balance, nM\u2212nX=4\u22122=2, where nM and nX denote the number of valence electrons on the M and X sites, respectively, the neutral antisite has two extra electrons after bonding which can occupy two defect levels in the gap, creating two occupied levels and one unoccupied level in the up-spin channel in the triplet state. In the case of 2/1 splitting, the lowest two levels dx-yand dxy are occupied and remain doubly degenerate. In the case of 1/2 splitting (MoTe2 and WTe2), in contrast, a single electron occupying dx6-yand dxy levels introduces a sizable spontaneous Jahn-Teller distortion which reduces the site-symmetry C3v approximately to the point-group symmetry Ch and pushes the occupied dx-ylevel down and closer to the dzlevel. We emphasize that different level-splitting patterns of neutral antisites in the 2H TMD family originate from the unique anisotropic orbital interactions in 2D materials.",
                                "In order to evaluate the stabilities of neutral antisite defects in the six 2H TMDs, we calculate the thermodynamic charge transition levels shown in FIG. 1D. Charge state corrections for the charged antisite systems are adopted by utilizing an extrapolation method (see Methods section below) (36), (37). Energy windows for the Fermi level in the gap where the neutral charge state is most stable are 1.43 eV, 0.88 eV, 0.48 eV, 1.01 eV, 1.24 eV, 0.19 eV for WS0, WSe0, WTe0, Mos0, MoSe0, and MoTe0, respectively. Note that our thermodynamic transition levels, obtained via the hybrid functional calculations, are expected only to capture the trends in defect stabilities. However, it is reasonable to expect that neutral antisite defects will be stable in these 2H-TMDs when the Fermi level is close to the mid-gap.",
                                "For a viable defect qubit, the defect levels related to qubit operation must be deep in the gap to minimize effects of disruptive interactions with the bulk bands. The highest occupied defect levels of MoS0, MoSe0,MoTe0, and WTe0 lie close (within 0.3 eV) to the valence band maximum (VBM) of the host materials. In contrast, the defect levels in WS0 and WSe0 are sufficiently deep (about 0.6 eV above the VBM) for qubit operation (38).

                                "We now discuss WS0 in WS2 as a benchmark system to demonstrate the operation principle of our antisite defect qubits, with reference to FIGS. 2A-2D. FIGS. 2A-2D are schematic diagrams illustrating the electronic and geometric structure of the neutral antisite defect WS0 in WS2, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram showing optimized structure of the antisite defect WS0 in WS2, showing its C3v local symmetry. FIG. 2B is a schematic energy diagram showing the defect levels in the triplet ground state 3A2. The defect levels e and a1 are mainly composed of the {dx-y, Dxy} and dz2 orbitals of the defect. Schematics of the wavefunctions involved are shown. FIG. 2C is a schematic diagram showing configuration coordinate diagram of WS0 in WS2 for the triplet ground state 3A2 and the triplet excited state 3E. FIG. 2D is a schematic diagram showing sublevels for the triplet ground state 3A2, the triplet excited state 3E, and the singlet states 1E and 1A1, labeled by the IRREPS of C3v. Spin-conserving optical transitions are shown by the four solid arrows on the left of FIG. 2D. Symmetry-allowed intersystem-crossing paths are noted by dashed arrows. The labels {\u03930\u22a5, \u03931\u22a5} and \u03932\u22a5 indicate the allowed intersystem-crossing paths via the nonaxial spin-orbit coupling and the axial spin-orbit coupling, respectively.",
                                "A pristine monolayer of WS2 in the H-phase is composed of three hexagonal layers that form a sandwich-like structure (S-W-S). We define the direction of the c lattice vector as the z-axis. The sulfur atoms occupy the upper and lower hexagonal sublattice sheets with a symmetrical W plane lying between these sheets. The optimized structure indicates that the W-S and S-S distances are 2.391 \u212b and 3.107 \u212b, respectively (33) (39). Hybrid functional calculations predict a band gap of 2.40 eV which is close to the experimental value of about 2.41 eV (40). The optimized structure of the anion antisite Whd S0 is shown in FIG. 2A. The local environment of WS0 without perturbation has C3v symmetry with the rotation axis lying along the z-direction. Note that if the antisite in WS2 is initially perturbed by a random displacement, the symmetry of the resulting structure can be lowered from Civ to Ch with a lower energy by \u02dc30 meV per unit cell compared to the metastable structure with C3v symmetry.",
                                "The calculated electronic structure of WS0 hosts a triplet ground state. The in-gap defect levels can be labeled by IRREPS of the point-group C3v as shown in FIG. 2B. The ground and excited states of WS0 are described by single Slater determinants as e2 and a11e1, respectively. Note that one can equivalently express a many-body state by either electron occupation or hole occupation of the single-particle orbitals (41). From this point of view, the defect levels of NV\u2212center in diamond (hole occupation) is identical to the defect levels of WS0 (electron occupation) in terms of single Slater determinants (41) (42) (43). Therefore, we will adopt the state symbols for e2 and a11e1 as {3A2, 1E, 1A1}, and 3E, respectively.",
                                "To get access to the transition processes involving the triplet ground state 3A2 and the triplet excited state 3E, we perform constrained DFT (CDFT) calculations (44) (45) (46) (47) where occupations of the Kohn-Sham orbitals are constrained to desirable configurations. As shown in the configuration coordinate diagram (FIG. 2C), the zero-phonon line (ZPL) for the internal transition between the triplet ground and triplet excited states is 0.695 eV, which is in the near infrared (IR) range. The Franck-Condon relaxation energies are 0.009 eV and 0.003 eV for the excited and ground states, respectively. These extremely small vibrational couplings in the internal transitions imply that antisite defects in TMDs may be suitable for other QIS applications such as single-photon emitters, quantum sensors, and quantum registers.",
                                "Positions of singlet states are significant for nonradiative decay paths that connect triplet and singlet states. We estimate positions of singlet states 1E and 1A1 by considering the Coulomb interaction (42) (48). (Note that since the singlet state 1A1 is strongly correlated, it cannot be described accurately as a single-particle Kohn-Sham state). Since we have the same local symmetry, we can adopt the results for the NV\u2212 center (42) in which the ratio of energy shifts for 1E and 1A1 relative to 3A2 is 1:2. The energy difference obtained by first-principles calculations between 1E and 3A2 is 0.275 eV, from which the energy difference between 1A1 and 3A2 can be estimated to be 0.55 eV. Considering that the ZPL of the triplet states is 0.695 eV, it indicates that singlet states 1E and 1A1 are located between the triplet excited state 3E and the triplet ground state 3A2 (FIG. 2D). The energy difference between 1E and 1A1 is estimated to be 0.275 eV, which is associated with the ZPL between 1E and 1A1 estimated by the Coulomb interaction.",
                                "In order to operate as a qubit, a defect center must have distinct signatures of optical transitions involving various sublevels and support nonradiative decay paths (15) (49). The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects and the associated sublevels are important for ascertaining allowed intersystem crossings (ISCs) between different spin configurations (50). The spin-orbit operator Hso with C3v symmetry can be defined as Hso=\u03a3k\u03bbxy(lkxskx+lkysky)+\u03bbzlkzskz, (42) where lki and ski are angular momentum operator and spin operator projected to the ith component for the kth electron. The nonaxial strength and axial strength of spin-orbit coupling are represented by \u03bbxy and \u03bbz. One can rewrite Hso in terms of raising and lowering operators of angular momenta in the form Hso=\u03a3k\u03bbxy(lk+sk\u2212+lk\u2212sk+)+\u03bbzlkzskz, where lk\u00b1 and Sk\u00b1 are raising and lowering operators for angular momentum operator and spin operator, respectively. Note that the nonaxial components contain l\u00b1 and s\u00b1 which mix states with different single Slater determinants and spin projections. On the other hand, the axial component contains lz and sz, which can only mix the same single Slater determinants and spin projections (42). Note that in NV\u2212 center the nonaxial spin-orbit interaction is much weaker than the axial one (51).",
                                "Determined by matrix element of the spin-orbit operator Hso, intersystem crossing is allowed if <\u03a8i|Hso|\u03a8f> is nonzero. Since Hso is a scalar operator which belongs to IRREP A1, its matrix element will be non-zero only if the IRREPs involved satisfy the condition: rep(\u03a8i) \u2297 rep(Hso) \u2297 rep(\u03a8f) \u2283 A1. (52) Because Hso belongs to the totally symmetric IRREP A1, nonzero matrix element exists only if \u03a8i and \u03a8f have same IRREPS. In the triplet ground state, the spatial wavefunction \u03c8spatial belongs to A2 and the three spin projectors {Sx, Sy} and Sz belong to E and A2, respectively. Dimension of the sublevel space is three, given by the product of the dimensions of \u03c8spatial (1D) and the spin projectors (3D). The corresponding sublevels are labeled by the IRREPS of C3v which are E and A1. Note that the IRREPS of E and A1 have spin components {Sx, Sy} and Sz, respectively. The triplet excited state 3E has a six-dimensional sublevel-space which belongs to IRREPS {E12, Exy, A1, A2}. The IRREPS {E12, A1, A2} and the IRREP Exy have spin components {Sx, Sy} and Sz, respectively. The singlet states 1E and 1A1 form sublevels labeled by E and A1 which share the common spin-zero component (S0). Based on the symmetry analysis of these sublevels, the allowed intersystem crossing paths \u03930195 , \u03931\u22a5, and \u03932z are identified. The allowed spin-conserving optical transitions and intersystem crossing are shown in FIG. 2D. Note that \u03930\u22a5, \u03931\u22a5 involve the nonaxial components of Hso while \u03932z involves its axial component."

Initialization is shown in the left panel of FIG. 3: the defect center is pumped optically (solid line 340) from the sublevel E in the triplet ground state 3A2 to the sublevel A1 in the triplet excited state 3E, and then the defect center relaxes back to the sublevel A1 in the triplet ground state via intersystem-crossing paths \u03930\u22a5 and \u03932\u22a5 (dashed lines).

We choose the sublevel A1 and one of sublevels in E in the triplet ground state 3A2 as a two-level qubit system. Initialization of the qubit could then be achieved by optically pumping the defect center from the sublevel E in the triplet ground state 3A2 to the sublevel A1 in triplet excited state 3E. The sublevel A1 in the triplet excited state has an allowed intersystem crossing to the sublevel A1 in the singlet state 1A1 via path \u03930\u22a5, and then the system can relax back to the sublevel A1 in the triplet ground state via path \u03932\u22a5.

Note that the luminescence from sublevels E is expected to be weaker than that from the sublevel A1 due to the existence of an intersystem crossing path \u03930\u22a5.

FIG. 4B is a schematic diagram of the optimized heterojunction in a 2\u00d72 supercell with h-BN as the top and bottom layers and WS2 with antisites WS0 as the middle layer.

To overcome this problem, we have investigated a qubit protection scheme (FIG. 4B) in which the MX2 monolayer is capped on both sides with a layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a protective cover. Based on first-principles computations using the hybrid functional with the standard mixing parameter and the inclusion of van der Waals corrections (optPBE-vdW) for structural relaxation (55) (56), we find that the triplet ground state is preserved for the antisite qubit in the h-BN/WS2/h-BN heterojunction (FIG. 4B). Energy separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied defect level in the spin-up channel (related to the ZPL energy) is around 1.1 eV, which is close to that in the monolayer system. A small level splitting of 0.045 eV is observed between the two occupied defect levels which is associated with the slight symmetry breaking induced by the neighboring h-BN layer.",

As shown in FIG. 4C, the projected density of states (PDOS) on h-BN layers is located deep in the conduction and valence bands of the heterojunction due to the large bandgap of h-BN (\u02dc6 eV) and the type-I band alignment between h-BN and WS2 (57). We thus expect that the key optical transitions related to the qubit operation will not be significantly affected by the h-BN isolation/protection layers. The protected antisite qubits in 2D heterostructures thus offer a novel and robust platform for quantum information technologies.",

Taking MoS2 as an example, previous work (30) has shown that the decoherence of the electron spin originates mainly from the presence of 95Mo and 97Mo cation nuclear spins, and that it can be greatly diminished by utilizing nuclear-spin-free isotope 95Mo with which an exceptionally long spin coherence time (more than 30 ms) is predicted due to the small gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) of 95Mo. Since the ratio \u03b3(183W)/\u03b3(95Mo) is 0.64, we expect that even longer spin coherence time should be possible to achieve in WS2 and WSe2 based defect qubits for realizing controllable multi-qubit operations in solid-state 2D systems."

The system includes a solid-state two-dimensional material 550 comprising a neutral anion antisite defect. The neutral anion antisite defect is configured to be optically excited from a paramagnetic triplet ground state to an excited triplet state, and is configured to undergo nonradiative intersystem crossing processes between different spin-multiplet states, and is configured to provide two distinguishable luminescence signatures for two spin sublevels for quantum bit readout. For example, the system can include a monolayer of the solid-state two-dimensional material 550, which can include a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), such as a material of the formula MX2, where M comprises a material from the group consisting of molybdenum and tungsten, and X comprises a material from the group consisting of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium; in particular, for example, WS2 or WSe2. In addition, the system can include a first protective layer 552 of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on one side of the monolayer 550, and a second protective layer 554 of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) on another side of the monolayer, such as the opposite side of the monolayer. A substrate 555 can also be included. The system can further include an optical excitation source 556 configured to excite the neutral anion antisite defect from the paramagnetic triplet ground state to the excited triplet state. For example, the optical excitation source 556 can perform optical pumping of the defect center. A manipulation system 558 can be configured to manipulate sublevels of the neutral anion antisite defect in the triplet ground state. For example, the manipulation system 558 can perform an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique; and can use manipulation via microwave pulse. In addition, manipulation can be performed using an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique if a high spin-polarization exists. A readout system 560 can be configured to detect a difference in intensity of luminescence of different qubit states of the neutral anion antisite defect. For example, the readout system 560 can perform a process in which the defect center is optically pumped again, and the intensities of luminescence involving different initial states are detected."

The optical signatures of these qubits, including the ZPL for optical transitions, are evaluated using an in-depth analysis of the electronic configurations and the corresponding symmetry representations of the defect states in the antisites. Intersystem crossing channels for qubit initialization and operation are identified. A scheme for isolating and protecting the antisite qubits is proposed based on a h-BN/TMD/h-BN heterojunction structure.

To calculate the spin density near the nuclei, the projector augmented wave method (PAW) (61) (62) and plane-wave basis set were applied together. Recent advances using hybrid functionals have led to accurate descriptions of defect states by overcoming the well-known band-gap problem of traditional DFT. Our calculations were performed using the screened hybrid functional of Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) (63) (64) with default mixing parameter and the standard range-separation parameter (0.2 \u212b\u22121) to reproduce the experimental quasiparticle gap of pristine WS2 (40). The plane-wave basis set energy cutoff was set to 320 eV. For defect supercell calculations, we adopt a special k-point at (0.25, 0.25, 0) in the first Brillouin zone. A vacuum space of 20 \u212b is added along the direction perpendicular to the monolayer in order to avoid interactions between adjacent images. Structural relaxations are performed for all the systems which converge until the force acting on each ion is less than 0.01 eV/\u212b. The convergence criteria for total energies of structural relaxations and self-consistent calculations are 10\u22124 eV and 10\u22125 eV, respectively. The constrained DFT (CDFT) methodology (44) (45) (46) (47) is adopted for calculations of excitation energies as the total-energy difference between two calculations where the occupations were constrained and the structures are fully relaxed.",

                                "Relative stability of point defects depends on the charge state of the defects. We analyze this issue for antisite defects in TMDs by calculating the defect formation energies (Ef) with charge state q, which is defined as Ef(\u03f5F)=Etotq\u2212Ebulk+\u03bcX +\u03bcM +q(\u03f5F+EV)+\u0394E, where Etotq is the total energy of the charged defect system with the charge q, Ebulk is the total energy of the perfect MX2 system, \u03bcM is the chemical potential of metal atom M, \u03bcX is the chemical potential of anion atom X, \u03f5F is the position of the Fermi-level with respect to the valence band maximum EV, and \u0394E is the charge correction energy. Transition levels are defined as \u03f5(q\u2032/q)=(Efq\u2032\u2212Efq)(q\u2032\u2212q), where Efq is the formation energy for charged state q. One can interpret the transition levels as the Fermi level positions at which the formation energies of the defect in two distinct charge states are equal. The ionized energy of donor/acceptor is defined as the energy difference of transition level \u03f5(+/0)/\u03f5(0/\u2212) and CBM/VBM. In low dimensional system, due to anisotropic screening, ionization energy (IE) diverges with respect to the vacuum. We adopted the charge correction method (36) (37). We assume that the chemical potential of M and X are in thermal equilibrium with MX2, \u03bcMX2=\u03bcM+2\u03bcX, where \u03bcMX2 is the energy of perfect MX2 system. The accessible range of \u03bcM and \u03bcX can be further limited by the lowest energy phases of these elements depending on growth conditions.
