                        "As the current digital electronic computing technologies approach the physical limit, such advantages of optics motivate the recent development in building optical accelerators that can sustain the ever-growing data demand at the hardware level. Integrated photonics provides a powerful optical computing platform that benefits from scalable fabrications and integration compatibility with electronic circuits, affording architectures with rapid programmability. Considerable progress has been made in building integrated photonic neural networks with high data throughput by incorporating time and/or wavelength division multiplexing. However, realizing large-scale, fully connected networks on photonic chips can be very challenging. Most N\u00d7N optical computing layers based on spatial encoding require O(N2) scaling of photonic components (quadratic scaling with respect to N), occupying huge device footprints compared to the electronic counterparts. Such footprint-inefficient scaling represents one of the roadblocks for integrated photonic computing.",
                        "The emerging notion of synthetic frequency dimension provides a promising strategy to drastically scale up the optical computing systems in both classical and quantum regimes. Encoding information as coherent optical fields on a synthetic frequency lattice increases the fan-in/fan-out of a single photonic logic unit, thus improving the scalability of data processing by orders of magnitude. The implementation of frequency-domain N\u00d7N optical networks depends in part on efficient modulators that link N discrete nodes via coherent frequency conversions. While the electro-optic modulators provide broadband modulation, integrated acousto-optic modulators can provide improved modulation efficiency and large modulation depth with significant reduction in device footprint by exploiting the strong optomechanical interaction between co-localized optical and acoustic modes. Recent thin-film lithium niobate modulators have reached modulation depth that can couple a few sidebands, but a single device that can compose a fully connected computing layer on a sizable synthetic frequency lattice remains unrealized.",
                        "On-chip acousto-optic modulation includes balancing optomechanical coupling with piezoelectric transduction on a monolithic material platform to determine an optimum configuration. To that end, heterogeneous integration of silicon on insulator (SOI) with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible piezoelectric materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) are described for high-performance large-scale integrated modulators, representing integral building blocks for data-intensive frequency-domain optical computing systems.",

The large dynamic modulation depth arising from the engineered strong electro-optomechanical coupling enables the coherent frequency conversions among multiple sidebands spanning a synthetic frequency lattice. In this way, a single such modulator performs as a large-scale, fully connected computing layer that performs linear transformations on the complex-valued vector inputs encoded as spectrally coherent optical fields as illustrated in FIG. 1A. Advantageously, embodiments of the present disclosure exhibit persistent long-range spectral phase coherence of the MVM operations and represent a component for highly scalable and hardware-efficient integrated photonic computing architecture based on cascaded layers of modulators.",

The output on the synthetic frequency lattice is thereby a result of the weighted complex-number summation of the corresponding columns in G, representing the complex-valued MVM operation.",
                                "Referring to FIGS. 3A-3H, large-scale coherent matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) in the synthetic frequency dimension are shown. cj represents the j-th column of G, and xk denotes the input at the k-th lattice site. Error bars are calculated from 5 measurements. In an embodiment, the large matrix G is configured by driving our acousto-optic modulator at 803 MHz with \u221213 dBm power (\u03b2=11.3). In an embodiment, the vector input x of three coherent frequency components is synthesized and controlled by an intensity modulator MI. In an exemplary embodiment representing an experimental MVM operation, the laser frequency was set at the center optical resonance (\u0394=0), and the carrier transmission was removed, thus providing an input vector x=( . . . , 0, x\u22121, 0, x1, 0, . . . )T where x\u22121=\u2212x1 (FIG. 3A). These two input components couple to the 25 sites on the synthetic lattice through the non-local frequency conversions, which add up to a symmetric amplitude distribution at the output (FIG. 3B). The difference between the experimental results and the theory can be understood to be due at least in part to background transmission of the optical cavity (not included in the theoretical model), which becomes pronounced at high cavity modulation depth as the input optical field is scattered to many sidebands.",
                                "The DC bias can be modulated to generate an input x=( . . . , 0, x\u22121, x0, x1, 0, . . . )T where |x0|=|x1| and arg(x0)=\u2212arcsin(x1/ain) (FIG. 3C). The additional component x0 is also coherently scattered to the entire frequency lattice and induces the interference with the pattern formed by x\u00b11, leading to an asymmetry in FIG. 3D. To demonstrate the coherence of the full range \u201cedge-to-edge\u201d connections, the laser frequency was aligned to the 9th site (\u0394=90), and MI was set to produce an input x=( . . . , 0, x8, x9, x10, 0, . . . )T with |x8|=|x9|=|x10|. The DC bias on MI was switched between the phase relation of either arg(x9)=arcsin(x10/ain) (FIG. 3E) or arg(x9)=\u2212arcsin(x10/ain) (FIG. 3G). From the measured output amplitude patterns, observed properties include suppression (FIG. 3F) and revival (FIG. 3H) of the negative-order sites near the opposite edge by only phase-flipping of the carrier transmission, indicating built-in long-range phase coherence with the frequency-domain MVM operations.",
                                "Referring to FIGS. 4A-4C, in one or more embodiments, concatenated phase modulator networks are shown. In FIGS. 4A-4B, top, middle, and bottom lines emitted from the AOM represent the \u22121st, 0th (carrier) and 1st harmonic signals generated by the AOM, solid, dotted and dashed lines represent the carrier and \u00b11st sideband signals by the EOM. Yk denotes the output of the k-th synthetic lattice sites. In an embodiment, PS: RF power splitter; +20 dB: RF amplifier with 20 dB gain; and \u03d5: RF phase shifter. Practical optical computations using integrated photonics require programmability with a high degree of freedom to allow on-chip optimization processes such as backpropagation training in a neural network. For the frequency-domain computing architecture, a straightforward approach to increase independently tunable parameters is to concatenate multiple modulators controlled by separate electronics. To this end, general phase modulations in the full parametric space are effected, including broadband elements, constituting a non-abelian (noncommutative) group <G,\u22c5>, where the concatenation of modulators defines the binary operation \u201c\u22c5\u201d with matrix-matrix multiplication. The noncommutativity can manifest as nonreciprocal frequency conversions resulted from the coupling phase anisotropy and the non-unitarity (see Example 11). To demonstrate the feasibility of the concatenation architecture, two elements of the group G,M\u2208<G,\u22c5> are implemented with devices of the present disclosure and a broadband electro-optic modulator (EOM), driven by the same microwave tone.",
                                "Cascaded devices were prepared in both G\u00b7M (FIG. 4A) and M\u00b7G (FIG. 4B) orders and the responses were probed with a laser frequency \u0394=0. Since broadband EOMs typically have a low modulation efficiency with V at a few volts, RF drive at 2.903 GHz was chosen and a 20-dB amplifier added to the driving arm of the EOM to reach comparable modulation indices. In this scheme, the RF driving phases at both G and M count as independently programmable parameters in addition to the modulation depth. To reflect this increased programmability, a tunable RF phase shifter was used to control the temporal delay between the two modulations. FIG. 4C compares the measured output amplitudes for both the concatenation orders with varying modulation phase delay. Error bars are plotted from 5 measurements. The error bars at the 0th synthetic lattice site are slightly longer than the other sites due to a weak time-varying beating signal in the local oscillator in our heterodyne measurement. Nevertheless, the contrast of the results clearly shows the driving phase control of the noncommutative frequency conversions, featuring non-abelian algebraic structure."

To understand the relation between the acousto-optic modulations and these mechanical modes, numerical simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics 5.5) were performed to model the displacement fields in the suspended AlN/Si layer, corresponding to the resonances measured by the IDT S11 response. The mechanical modes that are of the interest are the fundamental Lamb mode (large out-of-plane displacement) at \u02dc800 MHz and the fundamental compressional mode (large in-plane displacement) at \u02dc2.9 GHz. Because of the long wavelengths, these two modes strongly couple to the 70-nm Si membrane and the optical nanobeam cavity therefore can induce strong phase modulations. The acousto-optic modulations are characterized by measuring the microwave-to-optical transduction signal Sim and can be used as modes for the frequency-domain matrix-vector multiplications.",

These higher-order modes are associated with significantly reduced wavelengths which increase the mechanical power dissipation and decrease the modal overlap between the mechanical modes and the optical cavity field (so weaker optomechanical coupling). Consequently, the higher-order mechanical modes have negligible acousto-optic phase modulation efficiencies (compared to the fundamental orders) and dominantly contribute to thermo-optic tuning of the optical cavity resonance. In addition, excitations of a symmetric breathing mode (VI) were observed. Although this breathing mode shows a larger piezoelectric transduction efficiency, it does not couple to the acoustic wave in the silicon membrane (in Lamb mode) due to the mismatch of the modal symmetry, therefore has no phase modulation effect.",

Meanwhile, with finite \u03b2, the value of Jv(\u03b2) is only non-trivial for the first several orders, that is, the terms in the summation that contribute to the frequency conversion have upper bounds for both k (n) and m\u2212n+k. Hence, the frequency conversions only happen for optical frequencies at a finite number of sidebands (n) near the cavity resonance, and the range of the frequency coupling (m\u2212n) is restricted by the modulation index. These two factors lead to the truncation of the effective vector length in MVM operations. For the same reasons, in a cascaded network of single-resonance modulators, the size of the vector space is also naturally bounded, and is determined by the frequency span (modulation index) at the last modulator of the cascaded chain. Therefore, by controlling the driving power applied to the modulators such that the modulation indices increase along the cascading order, the size of the effective vector space for performing MVM operations can be regulated with a finite basis, while reducing and/or minimizing the optical energy loss to irrelevant sidebands.",

The optical input was realized by coupling a continuous-wave (CW) laser to the on-chip grating coupler through a polarization-maintained fiber, and the output was collected from the output grating coupler by another aligned fiber. Spectra of the direct-current (DC) transmitted optical power (FIG. 1C, FIG. 2B and FIG. 2C) were measured by switching the optical output from our device to a low-speed photodetector (LPD) while sweeping the laser frequency.

In most of previous works where the modulation index is small (only a0, a1 and a\u22121 are relevant), SOE can be simplified to SOE\u221da0a\u22121*+a1a0*, which is widely used as the metric to the modulation depth and bandwidth when the laser frequency is tuned at the red sideband (\u0394=\u2212\u03a9, SOE\u221da1) or the blue sideband (\u0394=\u03a9, SOE\u221da\u22121*) for sideband-resolved acousto-optic systems. Another functionality of our homodyne measurements is to identify the center optical resonance frequency \u03c90 because SOE equals zero at exactly zero detuning \u0394=0 and has a large gradient in the vicinity. Traces of the |S21| center local minimum can be used to characterize the thermo-optic shift induced by the acoustic wave.

Example 6 describes the spectrum of the measured microwave-to-optical transduction signal at the mechanical resonances, including the prominent fundamental Lamb mode and compressional mode. The acoustic resonator formed by the free-edge reflector gives rise to a series of resonances in the IDT bandwidth. By mapping out the RF spectrum of SOE, on-resonance microwave tones were identified that can induce efficient modulation for each mechanical mode. The laser frequency was swept around the intrinsic nanophotonic cavity resonance to probe SOE at all sidebands.",

In particular, the 803 MHz drive with an RF bandwidth of 1.3 MHz induces a significantly increased number of sidebands, consistent with the most pronounced electromechanical conversion efficiency measured from Su. This RF tone thus facilitates the resonantly enhanced acousto-optic modulation, demonstrating scalable MVM at a large-scale synthetic frequency lattice. The minimum at zero laser frequency detuning indicates a constant optical center resonance frequency (no pronounced thermo-optic shift) at the \u221216 dBm RF power. For the fundamental compressional mode excitation at \u02dc2.9 GHz, the highest modulation efficiency is achieved at 2.903 GHz, where the optical mode overlaps with the anti-node of the acoustic resonator. The 2.935 GHz resonance has a weaker modulation because the optical mode primarily overlaps with the node of the mechanical standing wave. The acoustic resonances in this frequency range are subject to more mechanical power dissipation, evidenced by the increased linewidth of 7.5 MHz. As a result, a substantial red shift of the optical center resonance frequency can be observed at the RF power of \u22126 dBm. As mentioned in Example 2, other higher-order mechanical modes have much reduced modulation efficiency. As an example, a spectrum of SOE for the 5th-order compressional mode is described, which is barely measurable even at the RF power of 0 dBm. Excitations of higher-order mechanical modes, while contributing negligibly to the dynamic phase modulation, can function as thermo-optic resonance tuning, beneficial for aligning the operation frequencies in concatenated modulator networks.",

To this end, many technical advances have been made to successfully generate multi-harmonic acoustic waves and synthesize arbitrary acoustic waveform by designs of the electromechanical transducer. For example, systems using frequency-chirped interdigital transducers (IDT) to generate up to N=5 harmonic tones of acoustic modes can be applied on the heterogeneous integrated platforms of the present disclosure to enable the conversions of the RF drive into acoustic tones.

Benefiting from the synthetic frequency dimension (sideband space), nanophotonic cavity acousto-optic modulators fulfilled large-scale linear complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) in a hardware-efficient way, thus representing an advance of optical computing systems such as optical neural networks. To demonstrate such a prospect, a design and simulation of a multilayer perceptron neural network for image recognition and classification were completed, where the computationally intensive linear MVM operations were performed in the synthetic frequency dimension using devices of the present disclosure.",

                                "In simulations, the network was trained and deployed for recognition of handwritten digits using the standard MNIST database. The 28\u00d728, 8-bit grayscale images of handwritten digits were encoded in 28 vectors of size 28\u00d71 and fed into the input layer column by column. To prove the concept, the MVM layer was designed with three copies of our acousto-optic modulators in parallel (p=1, q=1,2,3) and each input vector was split into three paths with the weights w1, w2, w3. The modulation index for each modulator was set around 10 to realize the 28\u00d728 fully connected layer. The results of the MVM were read out, applied to a nonlinear activation function (sigmoid) and to the pooling layers. The output vectors of the network were compared with the prediction which defines the loss function. During the training process, the beam-splitting weights (w1, w2, w3), modulation indices and phases of the three parallel modulators and the pooling layers were optimized, such that the loss function was minimized. Example 11 describes the decrease of the loss function as the training process evolves with epochs. Iteration of the process for all digits from \u201c0\u201d to \u201c9\u201d reached an accuracy over 90% in simulation (Example 11). It is noted that the 28\u00d728 matrix operator has enough trainability to carry out image recognitions in simulations is realized by three copies of the simulated device, demonstrating the improvement of performance in devices of the present disclosure as compared to optical computation techniques.",
