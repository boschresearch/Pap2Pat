Therefore, precise measurement of the time-frequency pulse to be measured is realized.",

                                "Due to rapid development of integrated circuits, an electronic counting method is widely used for its high measurement speed and automatic measurement process. The commonly used frequency measurement methods used at present are direct counting methods, including an M method, a T method, and an M/T method. However, these three methods all have the problem of a counting error of \u00b11 word. In order to overcome the counting error of \u00b11 word, other methods, such as a vernier method, a phase coincidence detection method, an analog interpolation method have appeared. The vernier method has the disadvantage that it is difficult to design and the high precision can only be maintained in a short time. The phase coincidence detection method can realize high-precision measurement, but the time for measuring a gate cannot be too short because a phase coincidence point between a measured signal and a reference signal needs to be captured. The analog interpolation method greatly improves the measurement resolution, but it has the disadvantages of long conversion time, poor linearity, and the like. Although these methods above improve the precision of frequency measurement to some extent, they have some limitations in practical use, such as poor measurement stability, gate time uncertainty, and the like."
