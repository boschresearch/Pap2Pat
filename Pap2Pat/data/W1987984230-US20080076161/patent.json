                        "One of the primary goals of biotechnology is to provide large amounts of a desired protein by expressing a foreign gene in a host cell, for example E. coli. Significant advances have been made in pursuit of this goal, but the expression of some foreign genes in host cells remains problematic. Numerous factors are involved in determining the ultimate level and biological activity of a protein produced from expressing a foreign gene in a host cell. Among them are toxicity of the gene product and consequent instability of the foreign DNA sequence, level of RNA produced, improper or inefficient translation of the RNA, improper folding or insolubility of the translated protein and difficulties in isolating the protein from the cell.",
                        "Various nucleotide sequences affect the expression levels of protein encoded by a foreign DNA sequence introduced into a cell. These include the promoter sequence, the structural coding sequence that encodes the desired foreign protein, 3\u2032 untranslated sequences, and polyadenylation sites. Because the structural coding region introduced into the cell is often the only \u201cnon-host\u201d sequence introduced, it has been suggested that it could be a significant factor affecting the level of expression of the protein. This problem is created by the degeneracy of the genetic code and the fact that the various tRNA isoacceptors are not all used at the same frequencies by a single organism and the usage pattern varies from species to species as shown in Table 1. As illustrated in this table, the frequency with which synonymous codons (those specifying the same amino acid) are used in an organism is not simply an arithmetic average (e.g., 25% in the case where four codons specify an amino acid such as valine). Rather, there are clear biases in the codon usage frequency in a given organism, and these biases can vary dramatically between different organisms. Although the fundamental code for protein translation remains the same, it appears as though significant divergence has occurred in how synonymous codons are used, analogous to a language having evolved distinct dialects.",
                        "E. coli expression of some Plasmodium falciparum protein antigens has been difficult owing to the strong bias toward A/T synonymous codon usage by this parasite (see Table 1). Problems that have been encountered include poor protein expression, expression of insoluble protein, and plasmid instability. A/T rich codons are used infrequently in E. coli, which is thought to contribute to problems with heterologous expression of P. falciparum genes in this host. In the past, researchers have attempted to improve heterologous protein expression for many species by applying the principle of \u201ccodon optimization\u201d, which is to substitute frequently used E. coli codons, synonymously, for the infrequently used codons specified by the foreign gene. In this approach, the same E. coli codon is used every time a given amino acid is specified (e.g., CGG for every arginine)",
                        "However, more likely, expression problems occur because expression and formation of secondary structure of nascent protein occur co-translationally and depend on the rate of ribosome progression through different regions of the mRNA. This rate of ribosome progression is thought to depend upon the codon frequency, which may be related directly to t-RNA isoacceptors abundance (Ikemura, T., 1981, J. Mol. Biol. 151, 389-409). Thus, frequently used codons are translated quickly and infrequently used codons are translated slowly. Regions of coding sequence with slower translation rates may contain clusters of infrequently used codons and appear to be associated with unstructured intradomain segments in the protein that separate defined domain structures such as alpha helices and beta-pleated sheets. Temporary ribosomal \u201cpausing\u201d on the intradomain segment is thought to allow the preceding nascent protein domain to complete folding prior to continuing synthesis of the next domain (Thanaraj, T A & Argos, P., 1996, Protein Sci. 5:1594-1612). The selection of codons at each position in an amino acid sequence may indeed reflect a purposeful evolutionary adaptation that defines temporal requirements for proper protein folding. Thus, incorrect protein folding is likely to occur when a heterologous gene is characterized by codon usage patterns that are disharmonious with the t-RNA abundances of the expression host. A strategy to overcome this problem is to make synthetic genes having codon usage patterns that are \u201charmonized\u201d to those of the expression host. The goal of codon harmonization, then, is to deduce the relative rate of translation at each position in the foreign protein's sequence, based on the frequency with which its codon is used by that organism, and then match that rate to the rate anticipated for a synonymous codon in the host (E. coli) that has a corresponding frequency of usage. This concept is very different from that of codon optimization, wherein the rate of codon translation at each amino acid is designed to be high (optimized) and thus cannot be altered through selective recruitment of less frequently used t-RNA populations.",
                        "One can also expect that this approach would be useful for insuring optimal E. coli expression of proteins from species other than Plasmodia, as well as for insuring the optimal expression of foreign genes in species other than E. coli."

                        "Surprisingly, it has been found that, by using the concept of codon harmonization, partially modified as well as completely synthetic P. falciparum antigen genes give dramatic improvements in the yield of soluble, and likely correctly folded, protein. The method of the present invention is valuable for producing large amounts of a protein, e.g. a vaccine candidate that heretofore may have been unavailable for testing because of low expression, for producing pharmaceutically valuable recombinant proteins such as growth factors, or other medically useful proteins, and for producing reagents that may enable dramatic advances in drug discovery research and basic proteomic research.",

This can be done by substituting codons in the foreign coding sequence with codons of similar frequency from the host DNA/RNA which code for the same amino acid. Therefore, the result would be the same amino acid sequence of the foreign gene encoded by host cell codons chosen on the basis of codon frequency.",

Additional bioinformatic information such as protein sequence homology, motif homologies and secondary and/or tertiary structure homologies may be \u201coverlaid\u201d to refine the anticipated need for inclusion or exclusion of such codons. Furthermore, bioinformatic evaluation and design of nucleic acid sequence may be carried out to minimize formation of self-annealing hybrid (\u201cstem-loop\u201d) structures in the resulting mRNA transcript that could affect translational rate, independent of frequency of codon usage.",

                        "Therefore, the present invention provides a method for modifying a nucleic acid sequence encoding a polypeptide to enhance expression and accumulation of the polypeptide in the host cell. In another aspect, the present invention provides novel synthetic nucleic acid sequences, encoding a polypeptide or protein that is foreign to a host cell, that is expressed at greater levels and with greater biological activity than in the host cell as compared to the wild-type sequence if expressed in the same host cell.",
                        "The invention will primarily be described with respect to the preparation of synthetic DNA sequences (also referred to as nucleotide sequences, structural coding sequences or genes) which encode the P. falciparum genes, but it should be understood that the method of the present invention is applicable to any coding sequence encoding a protein foreign to a host cell in which the protein is expressed.",
                        "DNA sequences modified by the method of the present invention are effectively expressed at a greater level in host cells than the corresponding non-modified DNA sequence. In accordance with the present invention, DNA sequences are modified to harmonize codon usage in the foreign gene with codon usage in the host cell by substituting synonymous codons from the host cell for foreign gene codons of similar usage frequency, where necessary. In the first analysis, codons that will be changed are those that are used more frequently in the host cell than in the foreign gene. Those foreign gene codons will be replaced with synonymous host cell codons that are used at the same frequency or less frequently. In the second analysis, after overlaying bioinformatics approaches, the decision to actually change a codon will depend on the location of the amino acid in the polypeptide. For example, all codons that are associated with intradomain segments will be replaced according to the paradigm described above. For codons associated with domains, it is probably sufficient to replace the codon only if the codon usage frequencies vary by +/\u221250%. Depending on the degree of similarity of codon usage preferences in the foreign gene and the host cell, this could produce various results, ranging from no or little modification of the DNA sequence to many modifications. The former outcome would be expected for situations where the foreign gene and the expression host have relatively similar codon usage preferences or where bioinformatics focuses attention onto the coding sequences of the intradomain segments. The latter outcome would be expected for situations where the foreign gene and the expression hosts have extremely different codon usage preferences. In either case it would be expected that the minimum number of changes required would be those that harmonize codon usage within the intradomain segments and especially those intradomain segments associated with the initiation complex. It should be understood that heterologous expression of proteins may involve additional unknown complexities, in addition to a need for harmonized sequence. It would be anticipated that iterative, empirical tests of harmonized sequence may be needed to obtain optimal expression.",
                        "The following description presents one process by which codon usage frequencies between genes can be compared. The present process was designed using a commercially available Excel program. Any program which supports a relational database which supports a set of operations defined by relational algebra can be used or designed. It generally includes tables composed of columns and rows for the data contained in the database. Each table has a primary key, being any column or set of columns the values of which uniquely identify the rows in the table. The relational database is subject to a set of operations (select, project, product, join, and divide) which form the basis of the relational algebra governing relations within the database. Relational databases are well known and documented (see, e.g., Nath, A. The Guide To SQL Server, 2nd ed. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1995 (which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). The amino acid sequence of the protein can be analyzed using commercially available computer software such as the \u201cBackTranslate\u201d program of the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, DNA Star, Vector NTI, or a simple \u201clookup table\u201d written in Excel, or a modification of a commercial package. A computer program product including a computer-usable medium having computer-readable program code embodied thereon relating to comparing codon frequencies and translation rate is envisioned. The computer program product includes computer-readable program code for providing, within a computing system, an interface for receiving a selection of one or more target gene sequence, determining codon frequencies of said target gene and comparing to frequencies of selected host gene sequence, determining whether or not a codon should be modified to match a host codon, and displaying the results of the determination.",

Thus far, the classes of genes are only categorized for E. coli and are based on their role in cell metabolism (class I) their propensity to be highly and continuously expressed (class II) or their apparent origin arising via lateral gene transfer (class III). The codon frequency tables for species other than E. coli use an aggregate of all protein coding regions to determine codon usage frequencies, yet it is clear that in E. coli, the codon usage differs greatly between these classes. In fact, the aggregate may not be the best criterion to generate the rules by which codons are harmonized. Such criteria, which probably can be established by protein sequence homology families, may be important. Those proteins which belong to different classes in other organisms/viruses may have preferred codon usages that are not simply those assumed from the aggregate sum of all codon usage in a particular organism. This type of bioinformatic information may add additional value by generating certain \u201crules\u201d by which proteins have evolved and/or optimized their relative expression levels in specific biological contexts.

The primers were designed to introduce the desired codon changes into the starting DNA sequence. The preferred size for the primers is around 40-70 bases, but larger and smaller primers have been utilized. In most situations, a minimum of 5 to 8 base pairs of homology to the template DNA are maintained to insure proper hybridization of the primer to the template. Multiple rounds of mutagenesis were sometimes required to introduce all of the desired changes and to correct any unintended sequence changes as commonly occurs in mutagenesis. Also, in the Examples that follow, a totally synthetic DNA encoding the target protein sequence was synthesized by using long oligonucleotides of 55-65 nt, each with overlapping complementary ends, that were extended and amplified using PCR to generate modules of the gene. These modules were assembled by using ligation of appropriate restriction nuclease sites that are present in the designed sequence to yield the final synthetic gene product.

The vector for expression of wild type sequence MSP1-42 (FVO), pET(AT)FVO, was prepared by digesting pET(AT)PfMSP-142 (3D7) (Angov et. al. (2003) Molec. Biochem.

                                "The initial approach to improve soluble protein expression was to apply the harmonization approach in a highly restricted way, which was to identify areas of the protein that were likely to represent intradomain segments owing to the presence of clusters of infrequently used codons in the wild type gene. This restricted approach was taken in order to minimize the cost of producing synthetic DNA. The analysis revealed a single codon within an intradomain segment near the N-terminus of the protein that might benefit from harmonization. To prepare the expression vector, pET(AT)FVO.A, two overlapping oligonucleotides from within the wild type MSP-142 (FVO) gene sequence were designed to introduce a single synonymous codon substitution at codon #158 (codon ATC was changed to ATA) by using PCR primer-directed mutagenesis.  \n\n\n The base pair changes away from wild-type sequence are underscored. In the first amplification, the 5\u2032 end of the wild type MSP142 (FVO) template was amplified by PCR with the sense external primer FVO-PCR1 and the anti-sense internal primer EA5. In the second amplification, the 3\u2032 end of the wild type MSP142 (FVO) template was amplified by PCR with the sense internal primer EA3 and the anti-sense external primer, FVO-PCR2. The two PCR products were purified by gel extraction using QIAEX II, mixed (1:1) and were used as the template for a final amplification to produce full gene MSP-142 using flanking primers FVO-PCR1 and FVO-PCR2. The final clone was prepared by digesting the vector DNA, pET(AT)PfMSP-142 (3D7), and insert DNA, with NcoI and NotI, and ligating together.

To construct the \u201cinitiation complex\u201d harmonized MSP1-42 (FVO), these two oligonucleotides pairs were synthesized, the sense strand,  \n\n\n The oligonucleotides were designed, as reverse complimentary strands with overhanging restriction sites at each end such that direct ligation into vector, pET(AT)FVO.A, would replace the existing 5\u2032-nucleotide sequence between the KpnI and BspMI sites. The oligonucleotides were annealed by adding 100 nmole/ml of each oligonucleotide, in a buffer containing 0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.001M EDTA. The mixture was heated to greater than 95\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes and then removed from the heat source and allowed to cool to room temperature. To prepare the vector DNA, pET(AT)FVO.A, the vector was first restriction digested with BspMI such that the DNA was only restricted at the BspMI site located within the MSP1-42(FVO) DNA and not at the second BspMI site, located in the vector DNA sequence. Linearized DNA, 7.8 kb, was separated by electrophoreses on agarose gels and then gel purified using QIAEX II. Extracted, purified linear BspMI pET(AT)FVO.A DNA was then digested with KpnI to release the \u201cforeign\u201d sequence initiation complex, \u02dc100 bp. The vector DNA, containing KpnI and BspMI restricted ends was gel purified and then ligated with the KpnI and BspMI annealed oligonucleotides. The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli host, BL21 DE3 and plated onto ampicillin plates. Colonies were screened for the correct insert by restriction digestion with NcoI. Restriction positive clones were tested for expression using the laboratory's standard bacterial culture and expression methods. The novel MSP1-42 (FVO) \u201cinitiation complex\u201d harmonized clone, expressed from plasmid pET(AT)FVO.B, demonstrated a 10-15 fold increase in levels of soluble protein as compared to the MSP1-42 (FVO) single pause site mutant, clone pET(AT)FVO.A. To generate the final expression vector, the MSP1-42 (FVO) \u201cinitiation complex\u201d harmonized insert DNA from plasmid DNA, pET(AT)FVO.B, was subcloned into the newly constructed antibiotic resistance-gene modified pET vector, pET (K), by restriction digestion with BamHI and NotI.

Because the large size of the synthetic gene, four separate segments were created by using sequential PCR of the overlapping oligonucleotide pairs. The oligo pairs for PCR were selected so that the four segments could be joined by using three unique restriction enzyme sites (Hinc II, Bsrg I, Bst BI) present in the nucleotide sequence.

The LSA-NRC protein contains the highly conserved N- and C-terminal regions and two 17 amino acid repeat units of the 3D7 sequence of the P. falciparum LSA-1 protein. Two distinct approaches were undertaken to improve the protein yield by genetically re-engineering the gene sequence from the original P. falciparum sequence. In the first approach the gene construct was designed using the highest frequency codons in E. coli, ie the gene was \u201coptimized\u201d. In the second approach, the gene construct was designed by \u201charmonizing\u201d translation rates, as predicted by codon frequency tables, between P. falciparum and E. coli, to more closely match the translation rate in P. falciparum. An example of each approach is shown in the Table 2.",

                                "We found that the levels of soluble MSP1-42 (FVO) protein obtained following induction of BL21 DE3 cells expressing the wild type gene sequence, pET(AT)FVO was negligible and insufficient to advance for further process development. Rather than simply changing to a new expression system, such a Pichia, or baculovirus, we chose to try to fix this problem owing to the advantages that E. coli offers, especially with respect to expression of non-glycosylated protein. Our initial thinking was that it might be important to preserve ribosomal pausing at certain times during translation to allow for protein folding. We thought that we might achieve this by analyzing the target gene to reveal clusters of low abundance codons and changing those codons if necessary (harmonizing) so that they would be low abundance in the expression host (in this case E. coli). For the first approach for codon harmonization, we used, as reference materials, codon frequency tables for P. falciparum (Saul A & Battistutta D. Codon usage in Plasmodium falciparum. Mol Biochem Parasitol 1988; 27:35-42.) and E. coli (Data Reference Set, Volume 3: Data Files, Genetics Computer Group, Sequence Analysis Software Package). We evaluated consecutive codons as rolling triplets along the range of amino acids of interest, paying special attention to the patterns associated with domain segments, which separate minimal domain structures, i.e. alpha helices, beta pleated sheets. Within interdomain segments, the amino acid content is restricted to about half of the common amino acids and their corresponding codons tend to be used infrequently, indicating that translation proceeds slowly in these regions. This slowdown in translation within interdomain segments may allow nascent protein to complete the folding of one domain prior to initiating synthesis of the next.",
                                "Using this method we predicted putative translation pause sites (low frequency used codons in P. falciparum) and we identified a single amino acid substitution within the translated sequence, #158, which required harmonization for low frequency expression in E. coli. The Coomassie Blue stained gels shown in FIG. 3 compares partially purified wild type vs. single pause site mutant MSP1-42 (FVO), FMP003. The relative increase in soluble MSP1-42 expression is approximately 10 fold above wild type. At that time we recognized that \u201cfully harmonizing\u201d a gene might be the best strategy; we took this initial \u201climited\u201d approach owing to the expense associated with making synthetic genes."

Therefore, for the second approach, E. coli codons were harmonized to P. falciparum codons with the objective of preserving high and low usage rates in the region of the initiation complex. A hypothesis is that stabilizing the interaction of the ribosome on the initiation complex might lead to increased levels of translation, or that translation from a properly harmonized initiation complex might allow for the initiation of proper protein folding. Again, using existing codon frequency tables referred to above, we applied the same process more broadly to reveal all codons in the \u201cinitiation complex\u201d region that were mismatched for codon usage frequency between the target gene and the expression host. Five synonymous codon replacements were made and resulted in an additional 10-15 fold increase in soluble product when compared to FMP003. The estimated product yield for FMP007 is 15 mg/L based on small-scale chromatography. The levels of final product produced are substantially above the wild type MSP1-42 and the FMP003 product (FIG. 4). Given the improvement in yield of FMP007 compared with FMP003, we decided to try a fully harmonized gene. This decision was supported by our results from the full gene harmonization for the malaria antigen, LSA-NRC, which lead to bacterial expression levels in the range of 30-50% of the total protein from a cell lysate, all of which was soluble in the host cell cytoplasm."
