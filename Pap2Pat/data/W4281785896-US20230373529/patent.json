                        "Generally, a vehicle moves along a trajectory. When obstacles, such as other vehicles, are detected along the trajectory, systems can be used to evaluate a number of trajectories and select an optimal trajectory for the vehicle. Consideration of an extremely large number of possible trajectories is computationally expensive, inefficient, and slow, particularly in a complex environment. Further, in some instances, the selected optimal trajectory can still be considered to be unsafe."

The safety filter can identify generated trajectories that are considered to be unsafe. For example, the safety filter can filter out, from a plurality of generated trajectories, trajectories that are considered to be unsafe, such as when those trajectories fail a safety check. The safety check can involve applying a set of world assumptions used to predict the behavior of vehicles other than the monitored vehicle, a set of trajectory modifiers which are applied to the current trajectory of the monitored vehicle, and/or a set of safety checks which the modified vehicle trajectory passes.",
                                "By virtue of the implementation of systems, methods, and computer program products described herein, techniques for implementing a safety filter, such as for machine learning planners, improves the safety of optimal trajectories determined by the machine learning planners (or other model) by, for example, filtering out unsafe candidate trajectories for consideration by the machine learning planner. For example, the safety filter can filter out unsafe trajectories from the plurality of generated trajectories, rather than projecting the output trajectory to an ad-hoc trajectory set, which can be complicated and computationally expensive. Thus, the computational resources consumed by an autonomous system of an autonomous vehicle when planning operation of the autonomous vehicle through an environment can be reduced, by, for example, reducing the set of generated trajectories from which the machine learning planner selects an optimal trajectory for the vehicle. The safety filter can additionally and/or alternatively be lightweight, further reducing the computational resources required to select a safe and optimal trajectory for a vehicle. The safety filter can additionally and/or alternatively use a trajectory modifier to effectively implement a recursive safety analysis with minimal assumptions and checks, and/or without compromising comfort. This can result in improved safety in the optimal trajectory determined by the machine learning planner or other model.",
                                "Further, in some instances, machine learning planners often lack sufficient training data and training time, and/or have limited capacity that prevents such planners from always accurately selecting a safe trajectory for a vehicle. The safety filter can reduce the likelihood that an unsafe trajectory is ultimately selected for the vehicle, by, for example, filtering a set of generated trajectories to remove unsafe trajectories prior to the planner selecting an optimal trajectory. In some embodiments, the safety filter described herein can also incorporate expert knowledge about driving rules that the planner should always follow, further reducing the likelihood that an unsafe trajectory will be selected by the planner.",

If the trajectory is determined to be safe, the trajectory would be provided to the vehicle controller 610. If the trajectory is determined to be unsafe, the trajectory would be ignored or otherwise removed from the plurality of scored trajectories, and the trajectory with a next best score would be recursively evaluated by the safety filter 504 until a trajectory is found to be safe.",
                                "Referring again to FIG. 6, ML planner 506 receives the remaining (e.g., filtered) trajectories 614 from the plurality of trajectories 612. As noted, ML planner 506 can implement a machine learning model trained to generate a score used for selection of a selected trajectory 620 for the ego vehicle. ML planner 506 may additionally and/or alternatively select selected trajectory 620. For example, at 608, ML planner 506 (e.g., using the machine learning model) extracts at least one feature 616 from the remaining trajectories 614 and based at least on scene context 602 and remaining trajectories 614. Extracted features 616 can be encodings of data associated with the ego vehicle, the route of the ego vehicle, the map, the environment 10, and/or the like. Extracted features 616 can additionally and/or alternatively include a time-to-collision for the ego vehicle, adaptive cruise control information (e.g., a distance to track ahead, a speed of the ego vehicle, and the relative speed between the ego vehicle and the track ahead), a maximum jerk of the ego vehicle (e.g., taking into account the acceleration of the ego vehicle at a past, current, and planned trajectory), a maximum lateral acceleration along the trajectory, a concatenation of the particular trajectory and another (e.g., past trajectory), a speed limit, and/or the like.",
                                "At 608, ML planner 506 (e.g., using the trained machine learning model) generates a score 618 (e.g., a numeric score or other metric) for the plurality of remaining trajectories 614. ML planner 506 can generate score 618 for the plurality of remaining trajectories 614 based at least on extracted features 616. A value of the generated score 618 indicates whether or not the corresponding trajectory of the plurality of remaining trajectories 614 is an optimal trajectory. In some embodiments, a higher score indicates the trajectory is an optimal (e.g., more efficient) trajectory, while a lower score indicates the trajectory is a less optimal (e.g., less efficient) trajectory. In other embodiments, a lower score indicates the trajectory is an optimal (e.g., more efficient, safe, etc.) trajectory, while a higher score indicates the trajectory is a less optimal (e.g., less efficient, safe, etc.) trajectory.",
                                "At 610, ML planner 506 selects a selected trajectory 620 from the plurality of remaining trajectories 614. ML planner 506 selects selected trajectory 620 based at least on the generated score 618 for the plurality of remaining trajectories 614. In some examples, ML planner 506 ranks the plurality of remaining trajectories 614 based on the score. For example, ML planner 506 can rank the plurality of remaining trajectories 614 in ascending or descending order. ML planner 506 selects the selected trajectory 620 from the ranked plurality of remaining trajectories 614 based at least on the selected trajectory 620 having the highest score or lowest score, depending on the score that indicates the selected trajectory 620 as being the most optimal for the ego vehicle.",
                                "At 612, ML planner 506 provides (e.g., transmits) selected trajectory 620 to vehicle controller 610 of the ego vehicle. Vehicle controller 610 can include or be the same as control system 408. Vehicle controller 610 can control operation of the ego vehicle such that the ego vehicle operates according to the selected trajectory 620. For example, controller 610 can generate and/or transmit control signals to cause a powertrain control system (e.g., DBW system 202h, powertrain control system 204, and/or the like), a steering control system (e.g., steering control system 206), and/or a brake system (e.g., brake system 208) of the ego vehicle to operate according to selected trajectory 620. Accordingly, the ego vehicle can operate according to the selected trajectory 620, which is likely to be safe due at least in part to the safety filter 504.",
