                        "Certain diseases are characterized by the accumulation of amyloids. For example, amyloid deposits of PrPSc, A\u03b2, huntingtin, or alpha-synuclein are respectively associated with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), Alzheimer's (AD), Huntington's (HD), and Parkinson's Diseases. Although these proteins differ in primary sequence the amyloid fibrils they form have a similar \u201ccross \u03b2\u201d structure. While all proteins can form amyloids because specific side chain reactions are not required, it appears that the ability of the amino acid sequences of most proteins to fold into other stable structure inhibits them from forming amyloids.",
                        "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by an extracellular deposition of amyloid plaques, and an intraneuronal accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of affected individuals. A 42 amino acid long A\u03b242 peptide generated by proteolytic processing of the APP protein is a major component of the amyloid plaques, in which it is mainly represented in the form of detergent-insoluble amyloid fibers (reviewed in reference 1). Historically, the A\u03b242 fibers have been considered to be the major pathogenic agents of AD. Recently, this hypothesis has been challenged by findings suggesting that fibrillar aggregates may represent inert dead-end products of the A\u03b242 aggregation pathway. Considerable evidence now suggests that the primary neurotoxic effects are associated with soluble SDS-stable assemblies of A\u03b242, such as 56 kDa A\u03b242 dodecamers, or even smaller, low-n (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) oligomers of A\u03b242, which seem to appear during the early stages of A\u03b242 assembly (reviewed in [1, 3-5]), and could give rise to larger oligomers. Thus, the focus of putative therapeutic interventions has shifted towards unraveling compounds that inhibit the earliest stages of A\u03b242 oligomerization. A number of chemical screens have uncovered molecules that inhibit fibrillization of the A\u03b242 peptide (reviewed in [6,7]; also see reference 8). These studies, however, did not directly address the issue of inhibiting the earliest stages of A\u03b242 assembly, i.e. formation of the SDS-stable soluble low-n oligomers. This aspect is important, as inhibition of the wrong step may lead to accumulation of toxic A\u03b242 intermediates.",
                        "Fibrils form when denatured or misfolded proteins adapt a \u03b2 structure which oligomerizes to form SDS stable soluble intermediates culminating in fibril formation. It has been hypothesized that certain normally monomeric proteins tend, upon accumulation, to misfold and form oligomers which exert toxic effects on the neuron. Such proteins evade normal cellular controls of chaperone proteins that help fold proteins properly and selective degradation machinery that rid the cell of misfolded proteins (e.g. the proteasome or lysosome). However, inhibition of fibrillization may lead to the accumulation of toxic oligomers of A\u03b242. The formation of oligomers precedes the appearance of fibrils and oligomers are often undetectable once fibrils appear. The model described here can be used to search for and test proteinacious or chemical compounds for their ability to interfere with the initial steps of A\u03b242 oligomerization.",
                        "Thus, there is a need for a system where one can identify therapeutic agents for diseases associated with protein oligomerization which may have their therapeutic effect due to being either regulators of protein folding, and/or inhibitors of protein aggregation, and/or preventors and/or inhibitors of the process of fibrillogenesis, or those that can have an entirely different and possibly unknown mechanism of action. Furthermore, there is need for a system that will provide a rapid and cost-effective screening method for the identification of agents useful in the treatment, prevention and cure of diseases associated with protein misfolding and/or oligomerization.",
                        "Yeast S. cerevisiae is a simple and readily manipulable organism that has been successfully used as a model for various medicinal studies (reviewed in [9,10]), including neurodegenerative disorders, associated with the deposition of amyloid aggregates (see references 11-18). One of the most valuable contributions of yeast biology to the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders in animals was made by studying yeast prions (reviewed in references 19-21). The yeast translational termination factor Sup35p can form self-propagating infectious amyloid aggregates that arise spontaneously in the cell and manifest a prion phenotype referred to as [PSI+]. The essential Sup35p protein is composed of three domains. The 124 amino acid long N-terminal domain (N) is glutamine and aparagine rich, dispensable for viability, and required and sufficient for the prion properties of Sup35p. While the function of the highly charged middle (M) domain remains unclear, the C-terminal RF (release factor) domain of Sup35p performs termination of protein translation and is essential for viability.",
                        "Prion aggregates of Sup35p are transmitted to daughter cells along with the cytoplasm from the mother cell during cell division [22]. The yeast chaperone Hsp104, a member of the AAA+ protein family [23, 24] is required for the successful maintenance of the [PSI+] prion [25]. Hsp104 shears the SDS-stable Sup35p prion amyloid aggregates into smaller structures in an ATP-dependent manner [26, 27] and therefore maintains them in numbers sufficient for the successful transmission to the daughter cell [28, 29]. The ATPase activity of Hsp104 is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of guanidine [30], which is therefore employed as a yeast prion-curing agent [31].",
                        "Previous models of Alzheimer's disease have focused on unraveling compounds that inhibit fibrillization of A\u03b242, i.e. that last step of A\u03b2 assembly. Fibrils form when denatured or misfolded proteins adapt a \u03b2 structure which oligomerizes to form SDS stable soluble intermediates culminating in fibril formation. It has been hypothesized that certain normally monomeric proteins tend, upon accumulation, to misfold and form oligomers which exert toxic effects on the neuron. Such proteins evade normal cellular controls of chaperone proteins that help fold proteins properly and selective degradation machinery that rid the cell of misfolded proteins (e.g. the proteasome or lysosome). However, inhibition of fibrillization may lead to the accumulation of toxic oligomers of A\u03b242. The formation of oligomers precedes the appearance of fibrils and oligomers are often undetectable once fibrils appear. The model described here can be used to search for and test proteinacious or chemical compounds for their ability to interfere with the initial steps of A\u03b242 oligomerization.",
                        "A yeast model of the initial steps of A\u03b242 oligomerization is described herein. In this model, oligomerization of the A\u03b242 peptide was monitored through the activity of the MRF domain of Sup35p, to which the peptide was fused. The model shows that the easily scored activity of Sup35p's MRF domain is impaired in A\u03b2MRF fusions because the A\u03b242 causes the fusion to form SDS-stable low-n oligomers.",
                        "Importantly, only low-n oligomeric species of A\u03b2MRF were present in this model, which is in striking contrast to other cell-based models in which such oligomers were never produced. In this model, inhibition of A\u03b2MRF oligomerization by specific mutations in the A\u03b2 region restored activity to the fusion. Thus, the system allows the researcher to distinguish between the oligomeric and monomeric forms of A\u03b2MRF using a simple test. Using this method, it has been elucidated that guanidine treatment increases, while gene disruption of Hsp104 decreases, oligomerization of the fusion protein. It has been shown that Hsp104 interacts with A\u03b2MRF and possibly protects the fusion from degradation and/or disaggregation. The model system allows the researcher to assay oligomerization of A\u03b2MRF in the presence as well as in the absence of Hsp104. The latter scenario may be preferred as no mammalian homologue of Hsp104 has been reported. This model system represents a convenient tool to perform chemical and genetic screens for agents that interfere with the earliest steps of A\u03b242 oligomerization."

                        "The present invention is based upon the observation that certain neurodegenerative disorders, associated with the aggregation of amyloid aggregates in parts of the nervous system, are derived in part from the oligomerization of certain peptides and proteins. The herein described screens use the viability of yeast cells, which express peptides or proteins that oligomerize thereby contributing to the formation of toxic intermediates. These peptides and proteins when expressed in yeast serve as the basis for screening for therapeutic agents that interfere with their oligomerization, and thus may be further employed as potential therapeutics against disorders or diseases caused by these oligomers. In addition, proteinacious compounds identified in such screens as regulators of oligomerization of the aformentioned peptides may serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, SDS-stable oligomers of a 42 amino acid long A\u03b242 peptide are the major contributors to the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The present invention includes methods for screening for therapeutic agents (for example, proteinacious or chemical) that affect A\u03b242 oligomerization. The herein described screens use the viability of yeast cells, which express peptides or proteins that oligomerize thereby contributing to the formation of plaques.",
                        "In one embodiment, the present invention is a yeast model system focused on the initial stages of A\u03b242 oligomerization. This system represents a convenient tool to test or perform chemical and genetic screens for agents that interfere with, for example, the earliest steps of A\u03b242 oligomerization. The system centers on a protein fusion between the A\u03b242 peptide and the MRF domain of the yeast translation termination factor, Sup35p, and monitoring its activity by the growth of yeast on different media. The presence of the A\u03b242 causes the A\u03b2MRF fusion protein to form SDS-stable low-n oligomers, which mimics the ability of the natural A\u03b242 peptide to form low-n oligomers. The oligomerization of A\u03b2MRF compromises its translational termination activity causing a more frequent readthrough of the ade1-14's premature stop codon, or other markers (e.g. ura3-14), which is easily scored by yeast growth (See FIG. 1). Any number of point mutations may be made in any part of the fusion protein. For example, as shown in the below-identified examples, point mutations previously shown to inhibit A\u03b242 aggregation in vitro, were made in the A\u03b242 portion of the fusion protein. These mutations both inhibited oligomerization and restored activity to the fusion protein.",
                        "The herein described system provides a user-friendly assay to determine the degree of A\u03b2MRF oligomerization by examining the growth of yeast on complex or selective media. For example, in the below-identified examples, this system has enabled users to demonstrate that Hsp104 regulates the total level of A\u03b2MRF and the relative abundance of A\u03b2MRF oligomers. It is also shown that the yeast prion curing agent guanidine enhances the level of SDS-stable A\u03b2MRF oligomers, presumably by inactivating factors that degrade and/or disaggregate them. This effect was not caused by inactivation of the yeast chaperone Hsp104, which appears to protect A\u03b2MRF from the effects of such factors.",
                        "The invention also contemplates methods of screening for therapeutic agents for diseases associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins, for example Alzheimer's disease. These methods may screen for agents that can breakup A\u03b242 oligomers, or inhibit their formation. Such methods comprise, for example: (a) contacting one or more yeast cells with a candidate compound, wherein the yeast cells express a fusion protein comprising an amyloid protein or peptide (for example, A\u03b242) and one or more domains of Sup35p necessary for translation termination (e.g. MRF) and wherein the yeast cells express one or more marker proteins from alleles having one or more premature stop codons or termination signals (e.g. ade1-14, ura3-14) under conditions that allow for aggregation of the fusion protein, wherein fusion protein aggregation is either essential for yeast cell viability on media lacking the essential nutrient of the molecular pathway in which the marker protein is involved or where fusion protein aggregation causes growth inhibition on media containing an inhibitor of growth (e.g. 5-FOA, if the ura3-14 allele is used) in the presence of the marker protein; (b) measuring the viability of the yeast cell on media lacking the essential nutrient against the viability of the yeast cell on the same media supplemented with the nutrient, or measuring the viability of the yeast cells on media supplemented with growth inhibitor against the viability on media not supplemented with growth inhibitor; (c) comparing the level of viability with the level of viability of a yeast cell not contacted with the candidate compound. There may be a further step if the ade1-14 allele is used: (d) wherein the color of the yeast colonies contacted with the candidate compound on complex medium is assayed and compared with the color of yeast colonies not contacted with the candidate compound.",
                        "The present invention further encompasses alternative methods of screening for a therapeutic agent for a protein aggregation disease. These methods may screen for agents which can inhibit the formation of protein aggregates or oligomers, for example A\u03b242 oligomers. Such methods comprise, for example: (a) contacting one or more yeast cells with a candidate compound while incubating the yeast cells that express a fusion protein comprising an amyloidogenic protein or peptide (such as A\u03b242) and one or more domains of Sup35p necessary for translation termination (e.g. MRF) and wherein the yeast cells express one or more marker proteins from alleles having one or more premature stop codons or termination signals (e.g. ade1-14, ura3-14) under conditions that allow for aggregation of the fusion protein, wherein fusion protein aggregation is either essential for yeast cell viability on media lacking the essential nutrient of the molecular pathway in which the marker protein is involved (e.g. adenine, if ade1-14 is used) or where fusion protein aggregation causes growth inhibition on media containing an inhibitor of growth (e.g. 5-FOA, if the ura3-14 allele is used) in the presence of the marker protein; (b) measuring the viability of the yeast cells on media lacking the essential nutrient against the viability of the yeast cell on the same media supplemented with the nutrient, or measuring the viability of the yeast cells on media supplemented with growth inhibitor against the viability on media not supplemented with growth inhibitor; (c) comparing the level of viability with the level of viability of yeast cells not contacted with the candidate compound.

The aggregated or oligomerized peptides result in, or co-segregate with, these diseases. It is specifically contemplated that the protein aggregation disease is Alzheimer's disease. In other embodiments the aggregated disease protein is A\u03b242, huntingtin, PrP, alpha synuclein, synphilin, transthyretin, tau, ataxin 1, ataxin 3, atrophin, or androgen receptor.",

In further embodiments, the candidate compound is determined to be a candidate therapeutic agent based on its performance in screening assays. If cells incubated with the candidate compound cannot grow, or growth is reduced, on medium lacking a nutrient or supplement that is ordinarily derived from the in vivo expression of a gene under the control of the oligomerized or aggregated protein fusion, as compared to cells not incubated with the candidate compound, in some embodiments of the invention the candidate compound is a candidate therapeutic agent. In other embodiments, the candidate compound is a candidate therapeutic agent if cells incubated with the candidate compound grow, or growth is enhanced, on media supplemented with a growth inhibitor; susceptibility to which is ordinarily derived from the in vivo expression of a gene under the control of the oligomerized or aggregated protein fusion, as compared to cells not incubated with the candidate compound.

Such methods comprise, for example, (a) contacting one or more yeast cells with a candidate compound, wherein the yeast cells express a fusion protein comprising A\u03b242 and one or more domains of Sup35p necessary for translation termination and wherein the yeast cells express one or more marker proteins from alleles having one or more premature termination signals, under conditions that allow for aggregation of the fusion protein, wherein fusion protein aggregation is essential for yeast cell viability on media lacking the essential nutrient of the molecular pathway in which the marker protein is involved; (b) measuring the viability of the yeast cell on media lacking the essential nutrient against the viability of the yeast cell on the same media supplemented with the nutrient; (c) comparing the level of viability with the level of viability of a yeast cell not contacted with the candidate compound. This method may further comprise a step (d) wherein the color of the yeast colonies contacted with the candidate compound on complex medium is assayed and compared with the color of yeast colonies not contacted with the candidate compound. This step (d) is particularly useful when the marker protein is Ade1p expressed from an ade1-14 allele.",
                        "In another embodiment, alternative methods of screening for compounds that decrease aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins are described. These methods comprise, for example, (a) contacting a yeast cell with a candidate compound wherein the yeast cell expresses a fusion protein comprising an amyloidogenic peptide or protein (such as A\u03b242) and one or more domains of Sup35p necessary for translation termination and wherein the yeast cell expresses one or more marker proteins having one or more premature termination signals, under conditions that allow for aggregation of the fusion protein, wherein fusion protein aggregation causes growth inhibition on media containing an inhibitor of growth in the presence of the marker protein; (b) measuring the viability of the yeast cell on media not supplemented with growth inhibitor; (c) comparing the level of viability with the level of viability of a yeast cell not contacted with the candidate compound. An example of a growth inhibitor is 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). An example of a marker protein that can be used in the foregoing method is Ura3p expressed from a ura3-14 allele.",
                        "As described herein, the screening methods of the invention use yeast cells that are engineered to express one or more marker genes having one or more nonsense mutations. Marker genes and proteins are well known in the art. The marker genes may be, for example, selected from ADE1, LYS2, LYS5, CAN1, MET2, MET15, GAL1 and URA3. In addition, the yeast cells contain one or more mutations in their genomic SUP35 gene (encoding a yeast translation termination factor) such that the expressed protein is non-functional. Alternatively, the yeast strain may harbor a genomic deletion of the SUP35 gene; for example, a sup354::LEU2 disruption. In another embodiment, the yeast cells may contain a double knockout, or deletion, of SUP35 and HSP104 (for example, sup35\u0394::LEU2 and hsp\u0394::URA3). The herein described screens identify candidate compounds that decrease translational readthrough at the one or more nonsense mutation(s) introduced into the one or more marker genes. Yeast marker genes are well known in the art. Two such genes are ADE1 and URA3. Translational readthrough of the ade1-14 nonsense mutation causes ade1-14 cells, which are red on complex medium and unable to grow on \u2212Ade medium, to become lighter in color on complex medium and to grow on \u2212Ade medium. The herein described screens identify candidate compounds that decrease translational readthrough caused by A\u03b242-M-RF oligomerization (wherein the M and RF domains of the A\u03b242-M-RF fusion correspond to the middle and release factor domains of Sup35p).",
                        "The activity of the essential translational termination factor Sup35p (NMRF) is conveniently assayed in vivo by examining the efficiency with which protein synthesis terminates at a premature stop codon (a nonsense-suppression assay, for review see [2, 33]; FIG. 1). The assay may use the ade1-14 nonsense allele. Strains carrying this mutation and bearing fully active NMRF produce only a truncated (inactive) version of Ade1p, and as a result cannot grow on synthetic medium lacking adenine (\u2212Ade), while they grow normally on synthetic medium supplemented with adenine (+Ade). In addition, these cells accumulate a red intermediate of the adenine synthesis pathway when grown on complex medium. However, if the efficiency of translational termination at the premature stop codon of the ade1-14 allele is compromised, the cells gain the ability to grow on \u2212Ade (i.e. they become Ade+) and do not accumulate red pigment. For example, cells expressing the complete Sup35p containing the N (prion), M (middle), and RF (release factor) domain, are white and Ade+ when NMRF is in the aggregated [PSI+] prion form (FIG. 1a). Cells expressing an aggregation-deficient and therefore fully functional form of Sup35p lacking the non-essential N-terminal domain (MRF) are red and Ade\u2212 (FIG. 1b). Thus, this well established system reliably distinguishes between fully active monomer, and malfunctioning aggregated forms of NMRF [19, 25, 34].",
                        "The ura3-14 allele of the URA3 gene is another useful marker that can be used in the presently described methods. The ura3-14 allele has a premature stop codon and is useful because one can positively select for inactivation of Ura3. Cell producing Ura3p cannot, while cells lacking Ura3p can, grow on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (+5-FOA). Without the translational readthrough ura3-14 cells do not produce Ura3p and therefore grow on medium containing 5-FOA. With the translational readthrough ura3-14 cells produce Ura3p and therefore cannot grow on medium containing 5-FOA. Using this allele, one can select for drugs that reduce translational readthrough caused by the A\u03b242-M-RF oligomerization by selecting for increased growth on +FOA medium. See FIG. 8, for example.",
                        "Any yeast strain may be used in context of the present invention. Some examples of yeast cell strains that can be used in the present method include Saccharomyces uvae, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces uvarum, Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, Pichia kluyveri, Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida sp., Candida utilis, Candida cacaoi, Geotrichum sp. and Geotrichum fermentans. The preferred yeast strain is Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",
                        "As the invention concerns screening methods of a wide-variety of pharmaceutical, chemical and genetic agents, one concern is that some of the candidate substances may not be either permeable into yeast cells, or may not be taken up by yeast cells, or may be rapidly metabolized once they enter into the yeast cell, or may be pumped out of the yeast cell. The present inventors contemplate using suitable mutations of yeast strains designed to eliminate these problems. In one example, a yeast strain bearing mutations in 3 genes, the ERG6, PDR1, and PDR3, which affect membrane efflux pumps and increasing permeability for drugs are contemplated of use. This particular strain has been used successfully in cancer research to identify growth regulators.",
                        "Methods of using the herein described yeast strains and kits having one or more of these strains as components thereof are also contemplated by the present invention. The strains of the present invention may also be included as one of many components in a kit. For example, a kit may include a yeast strain containing a genomic deletion of SUP35 (sup35\u0394::LEU2), or a double deletion of SUP35 and HSP104 (hsp104\u0394::URA3), either of which harboring, for example, an A\u03b2MRF fusion under the control of an inducible promoter. The fusion protein may alternatively comprise any amyloidogenic protein and one or more domains of Sup35p. The strain may have a genomic background such as: MATa ade1-14 ura3-52 leu2-3,112 trp1-289 his3-200, wherein the ade1-14 allele represents a marker for which A\u03b2MRF aggregation can be easily measured.

Various types of candidate compounds may be screened by the methods of the present invention. Genetic agents can be screened by contacting the yeast cell with a nucleic acid construct encoding a gene which encodes a protein that can be expressed in the yeast cell. For example, one may screen cDNA libraries expressing a variety of proteins to identify therapeutic genes or proteins for the diseases described herein. In other examples, one may contact the yeast cell with other proteins or polypeptides which may confer the therapeutic effect.",
                        "Thus, candidate substances that may be screened according to the methods of the invention include those encoding chaperone molecules, heat shock proteins, receptors, enzymes, ligands, regulatory factors, and structural proteins. Candidate substances also include nuclear proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, mitochondrial proteins, secreted proteins, plasmalemma-associated proteins, serum proteins, viral antigens, bacterial antigens, protozoal antigens and parasitic antigens. Candidate substances additionally comprise proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, phosphoproteins and nucleic acids (for example, RNAs such as ribozymes or antisense nucleic acids). Proteins or polypeptides which can be screened using the methods of the present invention include chaperone proteins, hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, enzymes, clotting factors, apolipoproteins, receptors, drugs, oncogenes, tumor antigens, tumor suppressors, structural proteins, viral antigens, parasitic antigens and bacterial antigens. In addition, numerous methods are currently used for random and/or directed synthesis of peptide, and nucleic acid based compounds. The nucleic acid or protein sequences include the delivery of DNA expression constructs that encode them.",
                        "In addition, candidate substances can be screened from large libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. One example, is a FDA approved library of compounds that can be used by humans. In addition, synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from a number of companies including Maybridge Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK), Comgenex (Princeton, N.J.), Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.), and Microsource (New Milford, Conn.) and a rare chemical library is available from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.). Combinatorial libraries are available and can be prepared. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are also available, for example, Pan Laboratories (Bothell, Wash.) or MycoSearch (N.C.), or can be readily prepared by methods well known in the art. It is proposed that compounds isolated from natural sources, such as animals, bacteria, fungi, plant sources, including leaves and bark, and marine samples may be assayed as candidates for the presence of potentially useful pharmaceutical agents. It will be understood that the pharmaceutical agents to be screened could also be derived or synthesized from chemical compositions or man-made compounds.",
                        "Other suitable modulators include antisense molecules, ribozymes, and antibodies (including single chain antibodies), each of which would be specific for the target molecule. Such compounds are described in greater detail elsewhere in this document. For example, an antisense molecule that bound to a translational or transcriptional start site, or splice junctions, would be ideal candidate inhibitors. Additionally, natural and synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical, and biochemical means.",
                        "Screening of such libraries, including combinatorially generated libraries (e.g., peptide libraries), is a rapid and efficient way to screen large number of related (and unrelated) compounds for activity. Combinatorial approaches also lend themselves to rapid evolution of potential drugs by the creation of second, third and fourth generation compounds modeled of active, but otherwise undesirable compounds.",
                        "Useful compounds may be found within numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic compounds, including small organic compounds. Small organic compounds have a molecular weight of more than 50 yet less than about 2,500 daltons, preferably less than about 750, more preferably less than about 350 daltons. Exemplary classes include heterocycles, peptides, saccharides, steroids, triterpenoid compounds, and the like. Structural identification of an agent may be used to identify, generate, or screen additional agents. For example, where peptide agents are identified, they may be modified in a variety of ways to enhance their stability, such as using an unnatural amino acid, such as a D-amino acid, particularly D-alanine, by functionalizing the amino or carboxylic terminus, e.g. for the amino group, acylation or alkylation, and for the carboxyl group, esterification or amidification, or the like."

The resulting protein, A\u03b2MRF (see upper panel of FIG. 1 for constructs used in this study) was mutagenized in its A\u03b242 portion according to a recent model of A\u03b242 oligomerization [35]. The model suggests that binding of one A\u03b242 molecule to another occurs through four regions: amino acids 15-21, 24-32, 35-37, and 40-42 of one molecule bind to the corresponding regions in another molecule. Substitutions of Phe19, Phe20, and Ile31 were previously shown to inhibit aggregation of A\u03b242 in vitro and prevent its neurotoxic effects [35-37]. To obtain an oligomerization-deficient control for the A\u03b2MRF fusion protein, we disrupted the first and the second aggregation-important regions of A\u03b242 by making double A\u03b2F19,20TMRF (A\u03b2m1MRF) or triple A\u03b2F19,20T/I31PMRF (A\u03b2m2MRF) substitutions in the A\u03b242 portion of A\u03b2MRF. These constructs were expressed in a 74D-694 (ade1-14) sup35\u0394 strain, and therefore were the only sources of the essential Sup35p's RF domain.",

In contrast, yeast expressing A\u03b2m1MRF or A\u03b2m2MRF were dark pink on complex medium and Ade\u2212, suggesting that the efficiency of translation termination was almost completely restored by the mutations in the A\u03b242 portion of the fusion protein. No growth difference was detected in the control experiment on +Ade medium. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of A\u03b242 in the fusion protein caused it to aggregate into SDS-stable oligomers, thereby affecting its translation termination activity."

As shown elsewhere [26], prionized NMRF ([PSI+]) migrates in the form of SDS-stable aggregates, while MRF, which is unable to prionize, is monomeric (FIG. 2). The pool of A\u03b2MRF contained both monomers and SDS-stable complexes migrating at the predicted positions for A\u03b2MRF low-n oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) (FIG. 2). In agarose gels, the A\u03b2MRF monomers (calculated molecular weight \u02dc73.7 kDa) migrated at \u02dc65 kDa (FIG. 2A), rather than at \u02dc77 kDa as they did in the acrylamide gels (FIG. 2C). Nevertheless, the positions of the SDS-stable complexes increased with monomer size increments in both gel systems. The SDS-stable oligomers of A\u03b2MRF were able to withstand treatment with 2% SDS at room temperature and disaggregated into monomers only after boiling (not shown). We hypothesize that the presence of A\u03b242 confers A\u03b2MRF with the ability to form low-n oligomers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) similar to the oligomerization of the A\u03b242 peptide in vitro and in the human brain [38-41].",

Nevertheless, oligomers of A\u03b2MRF were stably detected by these antibodies (FIG. 3, left panel). We observed a similar phenomenon when we detected SDS-stable amyloid oligomers of NMRF, which represent structures interacting through the \u02dc14 kDa N-terminal domains, while the \u02dc70 kDa MRF domains on their C termini are exposed to the solvent. The efficiency with which these oligomers are detected with anti-N terminal antibodies is lower that with antibodies against the C-terminal RF domain [42, 43]. Apparently, even after SDS electrophoresis the physical access of the antibodies to the target epitopes remains impeded due to the assembly state of the target protein. These observations further corroborate our hypothesis that A\u03b2MRF molecules are oligomerized through their A\u03b242 portions."

We expected that mutations in the aggregation-important regions of A\u03b242 would inhibit oligomerization of the fusion protein. Consistent with our expectations, disruption of a single aggregation-important region of A\u03b242 (A\u03b2m1MRF) reduced its ability to form low-n oligomers (FIG. 2). Disruption of a second aggregation-important region (A\u03b2m2MRF) further inhibited oligomerization of the protein. However, small amounts of A\u03b2 m2MRF were found in the form of dimers. This is probably due to the fact that this construct still retained two out of four aggregation-important regions intact. The presence of A\u03b2m2MRF dimers explains our observation that these cells were dark pink on complex medium, and were not entirely as red as when a non-tagged MRF protein was expressed (FIG. 2). In addition, the mere presence of A\u03b242 on the N-terminus of MRF might slightly inhibit the translation termination activity of the fusion protein. Nevertheless, the fact that point mutations in the aggregation-important regions of A\u03b242 impeded oligomerization of A\u03b2MRF and restored its activity, illustrates the ability of the system to clearly distinguish between different levels of A\u03b2MRF oligomerization.",

These antibodies appear not to recognize oligomers of A\u03b242 smaller than octamers [44], and the oligomers of A\u03b2MRF did not reach this size. Nor could we detect A\u03b2MRF-containing structures that correspond to fibres of A\u03b2MRF, although we successfully used SDS-electrophoresis in agarose previously to analyze different amyloid fibres [43]. In FIG. 2B we show that amyloid fibres made of recombinant A\u03b242 peptide are detected in the upper part of the agarose gel, while A\u03b2MRF never formed structures of this size (FIG. 2A). It is possible that the absence of large A\u03b2MRF assemblies can be attributed to disaggregating activity of unknown cellular factors, or that the presence of a large MRF domain impedes the ability of A\u03b2MRF to assemble into structures larger than the low-n oligomers."

Thus we grew sup35\u0394 cells expressing A\u03b2MRF, A\u03b2m1MRF, or A\u03b2m2MRF in the presence of 6.3 mM guanidine. Strikingly, guanidine dramatically increased the amount of A\u03b2MRF and A\u03b2m1MRF oligomers, while depleting the monomeric pool of the proteins (FIG. 3). No such effect was detected with the control A\u03b2m2MRF protein. As guanidine enhances the Sup35p [PSI+] aggregate size by inhibiting the ATPase activity of Hsp104, we wondered if guanidine's effect on the accumulation of A\u03b2MRF oligomers was likewise due to Hsp104 inhibition. Contrary to this hypothesis, deletion of HSP104 decreased the proportion of A\u03b2MRF oligomers in three independent hsp104\u0394 clones (FIG. 4). In addition, hsp104\u0394 led to a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2MRF in the cells by \u02dc40%, while having no effect on the level of A\u03b2m2MRF protein (FIG. 4). As might be expected, such a decrease in the total amount of A\u03b2MRF in hsp104\u0394 cells resulted in more frequent readthrough of the premature stop codon of the ade1-14 allele: hsp104\u0394 caused A\u03b2MRF-expressing sup35\u0394 cells to grow slightly better on \u2212Ade, while having no effect on A\u03b2m2MRF-expressing sup35\u0394 cells (FIG. 5).",

                                "To test if Hsp104 interacts with A\u03b2MRF, we used HA-tagged A\u03b2MRF and HA-tagged MRF to co-immunoprecipitate Hsp104. Indeed, Hsp104 co-immunoprecipitated with A\u03b2MRF, but not with MRF (FIG. 7). This is consistent with observations made elsewhere [45] suggesting that Hsp104 interacts with A\u03b242 in vitro. We hypothesize that in our system oligomers of A\u03b2MRF undergo continuous disaggregation, and at the same time oligomers and monomers of A\u03b2MRF undergo degradation, as a result of interaction between an unknown cellular factor(s) and the A\u03b242 portion of A\u03b2MRF. We show that Hsp104 binds to the A\u03b242 portion of A\u03b2MRF and may therefore physically impede interaction between A\u03b242 and the factors that trigger degradation and disaggregation of the fusion protein. Consistent with this, deletion of HSP104 led to a \u02dc40% decrease in the total amount of the A\u03b2MRF protein (FIG. 4), possibly as a result of increased susceptibility of A\u03b2MRF to degradation-triggering factors. At the same time, deletion of HSP104 shifted the equilibrium between oligomers and monomers such that the monomer's share in the overall pool of A\u03b2MRF increased from 34 to 47%, possibly as a result of A\u03b2MRF disaggregation. As disaggregation of protein aggregates in yeast usually requires energy from ATP [46-48], it is tempting to speculate that guanidine may specifically inhibit the ATPase activity of the unknown disaggregating factors, as guanidine is able to inhibit the ATPase activity of Hsp104 [30].",
                                "Recent evidence suggests that chaperones play critical roles in protecting neuronal cells from the deleterious effects of amyloid aggregates and their precursors (reviewed in [49]). Such a protective mechanism may involve degradation and/or disaggregation of toxic intermediates. In yeast, disaggregation of aggregated protein is carried out by the chaperone machinery, which includes Hsp104, Hsp70/Hsp40, and small heat shock proteins (sHsp) Hsp42, and Hsp26 [23, 46, 50, 51]. All of these chaperones except for Hsp104 have homologs in mammals. It was shown that Hsp26 facilitates disaggregation and refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase [47] and citrate synthase [48] by Hsp104 and Hsp70/Hsp40. The disaggregating activity of the yeast chaperone machinery is not limited to amorphous protein aggregates. Overexpression of Hsp104 together with Hsp26 and Hsp42 [47], or Hsp70 together with Hsp40 [52], or Hsp70 alone [18] increased the solubility of polyglutamine aggregates in yeast models of Huntington's disease, while deletion of HSP104 led to solubulization of polyglutamine aggregates [53]. The direct implication of chaperone machinery to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is still obscure. The yeast system described in this study provides an opportunity to examine the ability of different compounds (proteinacious or chemical) to interfere with the process of A\u03b2MRF oligomerization. Abrogation of oligomerization of the A\u03b2MRF will lead in our system to the accumulation of A\u03b2MRF monomers, causing inhibition of growth in the absence of adenine, and a redder color on complex medium, thus providing a simple functional readout."
