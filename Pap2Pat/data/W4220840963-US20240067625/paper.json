    "title": "Oleic acid is an endogenous ligand of TLX/NR2E1 that triggers hippocampal neurogenesis",
    "date": "2022-03-25",
    "abstract": "Neural stem cells, the source of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus, are intimately involved in learning and memory, mood, and stress response. Despite considerable progress in understanding the biology of neural stem cells and neurogenesis, regulating the neural stem cell population precisely has remained elusive because we have lacked the specific targets to stimulate their proliferation and neurogenesis. The orphan nuclear receptor TLX/NR2E1 governs neural stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and proliferation, but the precise mechanism by which it accomplishes this is not well understood because its endogenous ligand is not known. Here, we identify oleic acid (18:1\u03c99 monounsaturated fatty acid) as such a ligand. We first show that oleic acid is critical for neural stem cell survival. Next, we demonstrate that it binds to TLX to convert it from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator of cell-cycle and neurogenesis genes, which in turn increases neural stem cell mitotic activity and drives hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. Interestingly, oleic acid-activated TLX strongly up-regulates cell cycle genes while only modestly up-regulating neurogenic genes. We propose a model in which sufficient quantities of this endogenous ligand must bind to TLX to trigger the switch to proliferation and drive the progeny toward neuronal lineage. Oleic acid thus serves as a metabolic regulator of TLX activity that can be used to selectively target neural stem cells, paving the way for future therapeutic manipulations to counteract pathogenic impairments of neurogenesis.",

                        "While MUFAs are abundant in mouse neural stem and progenitor cells (26), we do not know whether human stem and progenitor cells have similar fatty acid content. To examine this, we performed NMR spectroscopy on purified human neuroprogenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (SI Appendix). Two-dimensional 1H\u20131H total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), which identifies coupled hydrogen (1H) spins, revealed the monounsaturated bond of MUFAs in these cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). Next, we found several saturated fatty acid precursors and MUFAs in human neuroprogenitors using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, with oleic acid (18:1\u03c99) being the most abundant MUFA in these cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). Like their murine counterparts (26), human neuroprogenitors require fatty acid synthase to survive: Cerulenin, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase, decreased their viability in a dose-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). Treating the cells with CAY10566 (SCDi), an inhibitor of the stearoyl-CoA desaturases that catalyze the conversion of saturated fatty acids into MUFAs, resulted in a dose- and time-dependent decrease in survival in\u00a0vitro (Fig. 1A, Left). Strikingly, this impairment could be rescued by exogenous 18:1 MUFA but not 18:0 saturated fatty acids (Fig. 1A, Right and SI Appendix, Fig. S2B), suggesting that 18:1 MUFA are critical for the human neuroprogenitor survival.",
                        "If MUFA synthesis is required for survival of these cells, then MUFAs should be abundant in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis occurs. Using imaging mass spectrometry to map lipids in the mouse brain, we detected both 18:0 saturated fatty acids (m/z = 283.24) and 18:1 MUFA (m/z = 281.24) in the dentate gyrus, the latter producing the most abundant signal (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). To estimate more precisely the 18:1 MUFA concentration in the dentate, we spiked 0.5 mM 18:1 control onto the thalamic region devoid of the signal (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). The 18:1 MUFA ion in the dentate gyrus had relative signal intensity similar to the spiked control, indicating high concentration of this fatty acid in the dentate gyrus in\u00a0vivo (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). In addition, oral administration of CAY10566 in mice significantly reduced dentate neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation in\u00a0vivo (P = 0.0019 and 0.0357, respectively; Fig. 1C), consistent with our observations in\u00a0vitro. In sum, human and mouse neural stem and progenitor cells are abundant in 18:1 MUFA and require de novo MUFA synthesis for both survival and proliferation. We therefore considered the possibility that the MUFAs are not only being used for fundamental processes such as energy metabolism and lipid membrane formation but they could also serve as signaling molecules in these cells to regulate neurogenesis."

                        "Given that neural stem and progenitor cells required de novo MUFAs for survival and proliferation, we next investigated their ability to directly bind TLX. Because there is no crystal structure of TLX bound to ligands, we searched for a nuclear receptor with a known structure that binds fatty acids. Initial structural studies revealed HNF4\u03b1 bound to fatty acids (29, 30) and functional studies indicated that HNF4\u03b1 is selectively activated by exogenous linoleic acid (18:2\u03c96) in mammalian cells and in the liver of fed mice (31). We therefore built a homology model of the human TLX ligand-binding domain and performed molecular docking based on the X-ray crystal structure of fatty acid-bound HNF4\u03b1 ligand-binding domain (Protein Data Bank ID code 1M7W) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). These docking studies suggested that fatty acids could indeed fit into the binding pocket and potentially function as cognate ligands of TLX (SI Appendix, Fig. S4E).",
                        "To determine whether fatty acids actually bind to the purified TLX ligand-binding domain (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A), we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) (32), a biophysical method that has been previously implemented to examine the binding of synthetic small molecules to other nuclear receptors and recently also to the TLX ligand-binding domain (17). We compared the binding responses of different fatty acids with an 18-carbon chain length to the TLX ligand-binding domain (Fig. 2A). Stearic acid (18:0 saturated fatty acid) had no observable binding, while \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3\u03c93 polyunsaturated fatty acid) failed to reach equilibrium or saturate over the concentrations tested, suggesting a nonspecific binding interaction. Oleic acid (18:1\u03c99 MUFA), however, displayed a saturable binding response with a dissociation constant (KD) of 7.3 \u00b5M, which would not be expected if nonspecific binding interactions were occurring. Interestingly, the synthetic 18:1\u03c95 MUFA had a similar saturable binding response with a KD\u00a0of 6.5 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). These experiments show that MUFAs, such as 18:1\u03c99, can bind to the TLX ligand-binding domain."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "To understand the functional effects of MUFA binding to TLX, we considered that in its basal nonligand bound state TLX recruits corepressor proteins such as atrophins (ATN 1 and 2) (33), lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) (34), and histone deacetylases (HDAC 1, 3, and 5) to potently repress transcription (35). We first confirmed the direct interaction between TLX and the atrophin corepressor peptide using BLI and found that the atrophin peptide binds TLX with a KD\u00a0of 14.2 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). We next used the amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (ALPHA), a proximity assay that measures the interaction of the donor and acceptor beads using luminescence. With atrophin peptide and TLX ligand-binding domain on the donor and acceptor beads, respectively, competition with untagged atrophin peptide attenuated the ALPHA signal with an EC50 (effective concentration, 50%) of 1.3 \u00b5M, demonstrating that the assay can detect both TLX\u2013corepressor binding and its disruption (SI Appendix, Fig. S6B). To then determine whether fatty acids could disrupt the TLX\u2013atrophin peptide interaction, we examined a panel of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated) (Fig. 2B). The saturated fatty acids (14:0, 16:0, and 18:0) had no effect on the ALPHA signal, indicating that they do not interfere with the interaction of atrophin with the TLX ligand-binding domain. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2\u03c96 and 20:4\u03c96) were, at best, only modestly active as they minimally diminished the ALPHA signal, indicating that they prevented some interaction of atrophin with the TLX ligand-binding domain. Among the MUFAs, both the short- and long-chain fatty acids (e.g., 14:1\u03c95 and 24:1\u03c99) were inactive. The medium-chain MUFAs, however\u201418:1\u03c99 (oleic acid), 18:1\u03c912, and 20:1\u03c99\u2014clearly disrupted the interaction of TLX with the corepressor. Out of the entire panel of fatty acids examined, cis 18:1\u03c99 (oleic acid) reduced the interaction of atrophin with the TLX ligand-binding domain the most. Given that this was also the most abundant MUFA in human neural stem and progenitor cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B) and in the dentate gyrus in\u00a0vivo (Fig. 1B, SI Appendix, Fig. S3), and the most potent fatty acid in the panel at a single dose, we next performed dose\u2013response experiments. These confirmed that 18:1\u03c99, but not the unnatural trans isomer, disrupts the interaction of the TLX ligand-binding domain with the atrophin peptide in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 = 19.3 \u00b5M (Fig. 2C). We thus conclude that the TLX ligand-binding domain stereospecifically recognizes certain fatty acids and that occupancy of the TLX ligand-binding pocket by specific MUFAs, especially oleic acid, elicits conformational changes that disengage the atrophin corepressor.",
                        "We next wondered whether fatty acid ligands could induce TLX to switch from corepressor to coactivator binding. TLX interacts with nuclear receptor coactivators such as NCOA1, NCOA2, and NCOA3 (SRC1\u20133) (36). To examine whether oleic acid-bound TLX could recruit NCOA1, we again used the ALPHA screen, placing a tagged NCOA1-II coactivator peptide containing the canonical LXXLL nuclear receptor interaction motif and the TLX ligand-binding domain on donor and acceptor beads, respectively. In the absence of fatty acids or in the presence of only saturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids, there was no interaction between the NCOA1-II peptide and the TLX ligand-binding domain, but 18:1\u03c99 markedly increased the ALPHA signal (Fig. 2D), indicating that the NCOA1-II peptide interacted with the TLX ligand-binding domain. As with disruption of the TLX\u2013corepressor interaction, dose-dependent enhancement of the TLX\u2013coactivator interaction was specific to 18:1\u03c99 and not trans18:1\u03c99 (Fig. 2E), confirming stereospecificity of fatty acid binding and coactivator recruitment, although saturable coactivator peptide binding was not observed under these conditions (Fig. 2E). To then determine the affinity of coactivator binding, we performed competition experiments and found that, in the presence of saturating 18:1\u03c99, TLX recruited both the NCOA1-II peptide and a receptor-interaction domain from NCOA3, with EC50 values of 5.6 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C) and 3.3 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Fig. S6D), respectively. A TLX-based homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay independently verified ligand-dependent coactivator recruitment and the specificity of cis/trans 18:1\u03c99 recognition (Fig. 2F). These data strongly indicate that oleic acid binding to TLX ligand-binding domain determines whether TLX functions as a transcriptional repressor or an activator.",
                        "To examine the effect of 18:1\u03c99 on TLX-mediated transcription, we built a dual luciferase transcriptional reporter system with a previously reported TLX-binding response element (37). We cotransfected a TLX expression vector or empty vector control with the reporter plasmids in HeLa cells grown in media with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. This delipidated serum is expected to minimize exogenous fatty acids and other nonpolar molecules but not endogenous fatty acids produced by lipogenesis. Luciferase expression was modestly reduced in TLX-expressing cells compared to cotransfection with the empty TLX expression vector (Fig. 3A), confirming the repressive function of TLX at baseline. We also confirmed the predicted 18:1\u03c99 agonist activity by the expected dose-dependent increase in luciferase expression (Fig. 3B, Left). This effect was not seen with trans18:1\u03c99 (Fig. 3B, Right; SI Appendix, Fig. S6E). These responses were modest, perhaps due to the presence of endogenous 18:1\u03c99, but verify that the stereospecific recognition of the cis form of 18:1\u03c99 is retained in living cells and that 18:1\u03c99 binding promotes TLX-mediated transcriptional activation of TLX-dependent genes."

We stereotactically delivered either sham, 18:1\u03c99, or 18:3\u03c93 (fatty acid control) to the dentate gyrus of young (Fig. 3 C\u2013E) or old (Fig. 3F) mice, treated them with BrdU analogs to label newborn cells, and killed them at different time points postinjection. Compared to controls, the number of proliferating EdU+ neural stem cells and their progeny, transiently amplifying progenitors, in young mice was elevated 24 h postinjection at the site of 18:1\u03c99 injection only (Fig. 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Table S1A). The stimulatory effect of 18:1\u03c99 is thus specific and local. The number of immature (DCX+, CldU+) and mature (NeuN+, CldU+) newborn neurons rose 30 d following 18:1\u03c99 injection (Fig. 3E, Left and SI Appendix, Table S1B), confirming neurogenesis had been stimulated. The number of proliferating (IdU+) neural stem cells at this time point did not significantly differ from controls (even though there was an upward trend), indicating that the stimulatory effect of exogenous 18:1\u03c99 on these cells in young mice is short-lived (Fig. 3E, Right and SI Appendix, Table S1B). In aged mice, 18:1\u03c99 also led to substantial proliferation of neural stem cells and transiently amplifying progenitors (Fig. 3F and SI Appendix, Table S1C). While the total number of GFAP+, Sox2+ neural stem cells did not change, the number of those dividing (GFAP+, Sox2+, EdU+) significantly increased. This was accompanied by an increased total number of transiently amplifying progenitors (GFAP\u2212, Sox2+) and those that proliferated (GFAP\u2212, Sox2+, EdU+), further corroborating 18:1\u03c99 effects observed in the young mice (Fig. 3D).",
                        "We then sought to determine whether 18:1\u03c99-activated neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis correlates with the cell cycle and neurogenic gene expression in\u00a0vivo. We injected either sham, 18:1\u03c99, or 18:3\u03c93 (fatty acid control) into both dentate gyri of Lfng-eGFP mice and performed RT-PCR on sorted neural stem cells 24 h later to measure expression of a panel of cell cycle and neurogenesis genes (Fig. 4A). In total, we analyzed 74 cell cycle genes and 67 neurogenesis genes (Fig. 4B). We then imposed stringent criteria to qualify a gene as being activated in an 18:1\u03c99-dependent manner: It should be up-regulated fourfold or more by 18:1\u03c99 and not affected by 18:3\u03c93. Sixty-three genes involved in the cell cycle and 48 in neurogenesis satisfied the first criterion (Fig. 4B). Of those, 8 cell cycle and 11 neurogenesis genes were not only up-regulated by 18:1\u03c99 but also by 18:3\u03c93 (which did not affect any of the panel genes on its own) (Fig. 4C). We thus excluded these genes from further analyses as those may be nonspecific fatty acid responders."

                        "To determine whether 18:1\u03c99 requires TLX to affect neural stem cell function, we used Lfng-CreERT2;RCL-tdT mice (38) and crossed them with the Tlxloxp/loxp mice (13) to achieve homozygous deletion of Tlx in Cre-induced neural stem cells following tamoxifen administration (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). In the resulting iTlxfl/fl mice, wild-type neural stem cells (no Cre activation) have two copies of Tlx (Tlx+/+) while mutant neural stem cells (Cre-induced) lack both copies of Tlx (Tlxfl/fl) and are labeled red (tdTomato, tdT). Thus, in iTlxfl/fl brains we can examine 18:1\u03c99-dependent cell-autonomous effects in both wild-type and mutant neural stem cells from the same dentate gyrus. The total number of proliferating EdU+ neural stem cells in sham-treated iTlxfl/fl mice was lower compared to Tlx+/+ mice, confirming the expected phenotype of iTlxfl/fl mice (Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Table S1D). Following 18:1\u03c99 injection into the dentate gyrus (the same stereotactic coordinates as in Figs. 3 and 4A), the number of proliferating EdU+ neural stem cells correlated with Tlx gene dosage: It was much higher when two copies of Tlx were present (Tlx+/+) than when only one copy was present (iTlxfl/+), and 18:1\u03c99 exerted no proliferative effect when both copies of Tlx were absent (iTlxfl/fl; Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Table S1D). Thus, independent of any purely metabolic role for MUFA, the stimulatory effects of exogenous 18:1\u03c99 on adult hippocampal neural stem cells and neurogenesis are mediated through TLX.",
                        "To then determine which of the 18:1\u03c99-dependent genes are also TLX-dependent, we crossed the iTlxfl/fl mice with the Lfng-eGFP mice (iTlxfl/fl; Lfng-eGFP), in which wild-type Tlx+/+ neural stem cells are labeled green (eGFP) while mutant Tlxfl/fl neural stem cells are labeled both red (tdT) and green (eGFP). This mouse model thus allows us to sort both wild-type and mutant neural stem cells from the same dentate gyrus (Fig. 5B). We injected either sham or 18:1\u03c99 into both dentate gyri 48 h after tamoxifen treatment of iTlxfl/fl mice and performed RT-PCR on sorted neural stem cells 24 h later using the same gene panels as before (Fig. 5B). Compared to wild-type neural stem cells (Tlx+/+ eGFP+, tdT\u2212) from sham-treated iTlxfl/fl; Lfng-eGFP mice, neural stem cells lacking Tlx (Tlxfl/fl eGFP+, tdT+) had 56 cell cycle and 63 neurogenesis genes up-regulated fourfold or more (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). These genes are thus considered to be suppressed by TLX. Among these, 45 cell cycle and 35 neurogenesis genes overlapped with those up-regulated by 18:1\u03c99 (Fig. 4B). Of those, however, 13 cell cycle and 3 neurogenesis genes were up-regulated by 18:1\u03c99 in the absence of Tlx (18:1\u03c99 vs. sham-treated Tlxfl/fl eGFP+ tdT+ neural stem cells; Fig. 5D and SI Appendix, Fig. S9), and we excluded them from further analyses as these may not be exclusively TLX-dependent. The remaining 32 cell cycle and 32 neurogenesis genes were up-regulated by 18:1\u03c99 in wild-type mice (Fig. 4B) but not in the absence of TLX (Fig. 5D), rendering them exclusively 18:1\u03c99-activated TLX-dependent genes (Fig. 5C).",
                        "The 18:1\u03c99-activated TLX-dependent genes included previously reported TLX targets such as Ascl1 (13), Trp53 (39), Mcm2, and Ccnd2 (40) but also revealed new targets such as Olig2, Shh, Fgf2, Dvl3, Hey1, Pax6, Nf1, Dll1, Nr2e3, E2f2, E2f3, Cdk1, and Cdk2. It is worth noting that TLX does not simply act as a binary on\u2013off switch: 18:1\u03c99-bound TLX activates cell cycle genes more strongly than neurogenesis genes, while lack of TLX derepresses neurogenesis genes more strongly (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). This is consistent with previous reports that a gradual increase\u2014and not a steady, high expression\u2014of neurogenic genes, such as Ascl1, is necessary for neuroprogenitors to slowly enter the cell cycle to avoid premature differentiation (41\u201343)."

                "In this study we identified oleic acid as a previously unreported endogenous agonist ligand of TLX, whose binding causes TLX to release its corepressor, recruit a coactivator, activate transcription, and through the action of downstream genes increase neural stem and progenitor proliferation and neurogenesis in both young and old mice. These results support a model in which 18:1\u03c99, oleic acid, acts as a critical signaling metabolite in neural stem cells (Fig. 5E). In its ligand-free state, TLX favors corepressor binding and repression of its target genes, causing neural stem cells to remain quiescent. Upon activation of fatty acid synthesis, oleic acid starts to be synthesized and accumulates until it reaches a threshold required as a metabolic prerequisite for the cell cycle entry. At that time, oleic acid binds to TLX, disengaging corepressors and recruiting transcriptional coactivators, which then triggers neural stem cell proliferation. In response to acutely increased oleic acid levels, robust up-regulation of cell cycle genes would prompt neural stem cells to generate progeny while preventing their direct differentiation. Temporally cued derepression of neurogenesis genes could then ensure that the progeny properly proceed into the neurogenic and not astrocytic lineage. We thus propose that neural stem cells use TLX to control the switch between repression and activation in response to neurogenic signals, at the same time tightly balancing the expression of functionally distinct cell cycle and neurogenesis genes. Because TLX activation requires relatively high levels of oleic acid, neural stem cells are not perpetually dividing and quickly depleting in number. Therefore, oleic acid might not only be essential for neural stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus but also for the preservation of neural stem cell population over time. Testing aspects of this model will be of intense interest to many fields of biology.",
                "Our findings shed light on the importance of fatty acid metabolism and MUFAs as signaling molecules in neural stem and progenitor cells. As previously reported, fatty acid oxidation is high in quiescent stem cells but down-regulated in proliferating cells. Several reports suggest that adult neural stem cells shift their metabolism to activate de novo lipogenesis in order to proliferate. For example, in one study Knobloch et\u00a0al. reported that quiescent neural stem cells depend on fatty acid oxidation as they specifically express carnitine palmitoyl transferase (Cpt1aA) (44), a key enzyme required for the transfer of carnitine to mitochondria and thus fatty acid oxidation. In another study, Knobloch et\u00a0al. reported that neural stem cells require fatty acid synthase-dependent buildup of lipids in order to proliferate (21). Further, malonyl-coenzyme A plays an important role in this process as a rate-limiting substrate for the de novo fatty acid synthesis and an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation via Cpt1a (45). Interestingly, hematopoetic stem/progenitor cells (46) and adult hippocampal neural stem cells (44) treated with malonyl-Coenzyme A proliferate more than control, suggesting the critical importance of this metabolic shift from fatty acid oxidation to de novo fatty acid synthesis for stem cell proliferation. Thus, detection of the increased intracellular levels of de novo fatty acid synthesis products such as C16 palmitate and other middle- and high-chain fatty acids, such as oleic acid, by the cell and specifically TLX to trigger the cell cycle may play a critical regulatory role in the checkpoint mechanisms that allow further progression of the cell cycle program.",
                "In sum, we report an endogenous ligand of TLX whose production is regulated within the neural stem cells where TLX resides. Other exogenous natural and synthetic TLX ligands that must be obtained through the diet (such as retinoid from vitamin A) have been reported (16), but their impact on neurogenesis or other physiologic processes in\u00a0vivo remains to be determined. The observation that exogenous oleic acid treatment is sufficient to stimulate TLX-dependent neurogenesis in\u00a0vivo lays a foundation for future efforts to preserve neural stem cells during aging and in disease. Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases, and the ability to stimulate neurogenesis directly could lead to novel and better-tolerated treatments for these diseases. The discovery of a functional endogenous TLX ligand motivates efforts to identify either brain-penetrant small molecules that can modulate TLX function or strategies to increase endogenous oleic acid and promote cell-based repair and neural regeneration."

Human neural stem and progenitor cells were generated from WA09 (H9) human embryonic stem cells maintained on Matrigel-coated plates in Essential 8 Medium (47), using a variation of the dual SMAD inhibition protocol (48\u201350). HeLa cells were obtained from the tissue culture core at Baylor College of Medicine. Lfng-eGFP mice (RRID:MMRRC_015881-UCD) were obtained from GENSAT (51) and received as FVB/N-C57BL/6 hybrids. They were crossed to C57BL/6J mice for at least 10 generations and fully characterized prior to use (38). Tlxloxp/loxp mice were a gift from Ronald Evans, Salk Institute for Biological Sciences, San Diego, CA (13). C57BL/6J mice and the AI14 (RCL-tdT) reporter line were from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX 000664; RRID:IMSR_ JAX:000664 and JAX 007908; RRID:IMSR_JAX:007908, respectively) (52). Lfng-CreERT2 mice were generated in the M.M.-S. laboratory (38). All mouse experiments were done according to the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol (AN-5004)."

We used BLI, an optical label-free technology, to examine interactions between the TLX LBD and different fatty acids. BLI binding measurements were performed with 6xHis-TLX LBD using the Octet Red 96 instrument (Ni-NTA Biosensors; catalog no. 18-5103, Fort\u00e9Bio Inc./Molecular Devices LLC). Alpha screen assays were performed following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (AlphaScreen Histidine (Nickel Chelate) and AlphaScreen GST Detection Kit, catalog nos. 6760619C and 6760603C; PerkinElmer) with some modifications. The homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay was carried out in low-volume 384-well plates at room temperature using Anti-His-Terbium (Tb) antibody and streptavidin-d2 (CisBio/PerkinElmer)."

Control mice were injected with ethanol:corn oil mixture only. Stereotactic injections were done to anesthetized mice as per approved protocol (AN-5004). We delivered fatty acids into the right dentate gyrus at three sites relative to Bregma: anteroposterior (AP) \u22121.5 mm, \u22121.7 mm, or \u22121.9 mm; lateral\u2013lateral (LL) \u22121.6 mm; and dorsoventral (DV) \u22121.9 mm, using nanoinjector (Nanoject II; Drummond Scientific). Each site received 305.4 nL of pure fatty acids in six pulses (50.9 nL per pulse). Injection was done in a slow delivery mode over 2 s per pulse. Each pulse was separated by 15 s. A glass capillary was gradually moved in and retracted from the tissue, over 3 min. Following killing at a given time point, mice were either immunostained according to the published protocol (38) or dentate gyri were isolated (55) and cells sorted using BD FACS Aria II. Each sample was generated from two dentate gyri. RNA was isolated from sorted cells using RNeasyplus Micro kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using RT2 profiler PCR array Mouse Neurogenesis (catalog no. PAMM-404Z; Qiagen), Mouse Cell Cycle (catalog no. PAMM-020Z; Qiagen), Mouse Notch Signaling Pathway (catalog no. PAMM-059Z; Qiagen), and RT2 SYBR Green qPCR master mix (catalog no. 330513; Qiagen). Expressions were normalized to \u03b2-2 macroglobulin (B2m) gene. We calculated fold changes compared to control group using the \u0394\u0394Ct method."
