## DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

- introduce electronic nose (eNose) tuned to human odor pleasantness estimates
- describe prediction of pleasantness ratings with Ëœ80% similarity to human ratings
- motivate link between stimulus structure and pleasantness in olfaction
- define perceptual axes, including odorant pleasantness
- describe compactness as an axis of the physicochemical odor world
- explain correlation of descriptors with molecular features
- introduce apparatus and method for assessing odors
- describe neural network-based mapping of odor information to pleasantness axis
- outline experiments for predicting odor pleasantness using eNose
- discuss results of experiments, including correlation values and classification success rates
- analyze implications for biology, biotechnology, and digital transmission of smell
- conclude with potential applications and future directions
