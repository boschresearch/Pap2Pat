                        "With the advent of gene editing technology, effective gene editing and transformation of different cells have been enabled. Site-specific recognition of nucleases can lead to DNA double-strand breaks at specific locations in the genome and trigger endogenous DNA repair mechanisms. Using the method of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair DNA double-strand breaks would lead to the insertion or deletion of small fragments, which can be used to generate knockout mutants. Homologous directed repair (HDR) can be used to construct knock-in mutants or reporter cell lines. However, even with the assistance of these site-specific nucleases, precise genome editing through homology-directed repair is still very challenging.",
                        "With the discovery of nucleases such as Cas9, some gene editing technologies based on CRISPR technology have been developed, such as CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing. CRISPR/Cas9 is an adaptive immune defense formed during the long-term evolution of bacteria and archaea, which can be used to combat invading viruses and foreign DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 system integrates fragments of invading phage and plasmid DNA into CRISPR, and uses corresponding CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the degradation of homologous sequences, thereby providing immunity.",
                        "CRISPR-Cas9 technology is the fourth method that can be used for site-specific construction of gene knockout cells and animals following zinc finger Nuclease (ZFN), homing endonuclease and TALEN technologies, which is of high efficiency and knockout speed as well as strong germline transfer ability and convenience. CRISPR would have a very broad application prospect in fields such as cell model construction, animal model construction, drug target identification, disease treatment, etc. Compared with ZFN/TALEN, CRISPR/Cas is easier to operate, more efficient, and easier to obtain homozygous mutants, and being able to introduce multiple mutations at different sites at the same time.",
