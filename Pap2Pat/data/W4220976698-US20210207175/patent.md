# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to the field of biology, and more specifically, relates to compound for regulating gene editing efficiency and applications thereof.

## BACKGROUD

With the advent of gene editing technology, effective gene editing and transformation of different cells have been enabled. Site-specific recognition of nucleases can lead to DNA double-strand breaks at specific locations in the genome and trigger endogenous DNA repair mechanisms. Using the method of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair DNA double-strand breaks would lead to the insertion or deletion of small fragments, which can be used to generate knockout mutants. Homologous directed repair (HDR) can be used to construct knock-in mutants or reporter cell lines. However, even with the assistance of these site-specific nucleases, precise genome editing through homology-directed repair is still very challenging.

With the discovery of nucleases such as Cas9, some gene editing technologies based on CRISPR technology have been developed, such as CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing. CRISPR/Cas9 is an adaptive immune defense formed during the long-term evolution of bacteria and archaea, which can be used to combat invading viruses and foreign DNA. The CRISPR/Cas9 system integrates fragments of invading phage and plasmid DNA into CRISPR, and uses corresponding CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the degradation of homologous sequences, thereby providing immunity.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology is the fourth method that can be used for site-specific construction of gene knockout cells and animals following zinc finger Nuclease (ZFN), homing endonuclease and TALEN technologies, which is of high efficiency and knockout speed as well as strong germline transfer ability and convenience. CRISPR would have a very broad application prospect in fields such as cell model construction, animal model construction, drug target identification, disease treatment, etc. Compared with ZFN/TALEN, CRISPR/Cas is easier to operate, more efficient, and easier to obtain homozygous mutants, and being able to introduce multiple mutations at different sites at the same time.

However, the accuracy of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is still not satisfying.

Therefore, there is an urgent need in this field to develop new compound that can regulate the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, especially to improve its specificity.

The experimental methods without specific conditions in the following examples usually follow conventional conditions, such as Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989), or according to the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Unless indicated otherwise, parts and percentage are calculated by weight.

### Example 1. Small Molecule Inhibitor Screening Based on EGFP Reporter

The EGFP reporter cell line was constructed as shown in FIG. 1. The CRISPR/Cas9 recognition site was inserted into the EGFP coding sequence so that the downstream sequence of the CRISPR/Cas9 recognition site was inside the box. The EGFP sequence was cleaved by Cas9 to produce double-strand breaks (DSBs), which would repair one of the two DNA repair mechanisms in the cell: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous directed repair (HDR). The insertion or deletion introduced by NHEJ would restore the open reading frame of EGFP, thus activating EGFP fluorescence (FIG. 1).

Without inhibitors, treatment of the EGFP reporter with CRISPR/Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) usually results in 11% of fluorescent cells. With the presence of small molecule inhibitors, the percentage of fluorescent cells activated by SpyCas9 would decrease. The 50% inhibitory concentration of each compound (IC50) can be determined by this assay.

The results are shown in Table 1.

### Example 2. The Activity of Compounds in Inhibiting the Cas9 on Endogenous Genes

2.1 Method

HEK293 cells (105 cells/well) were seeded on a 24-well plate. 24 hours after inoculation, cells were transfected with 200 ng AAVS1-AS2 and 200 ng pST-Cas9 plasmid or 200 ng EMX1 and 200 ng pST-Cas9 plasmid in Opti-MEM medium. 6 hours after transfection, DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 μM drug (Compound 49) was used to replace Opti-MEM. The positive control for Cas9 activity was 200 ng AAVS1-AS2 and 200 ng pST-Cas9 plasmid or 200 ng EMX1 and 200 ng pST-Cas9 plasmid without drug. After the gene editing was completed, the cell genomic DNA was extracted, and the gene editing efficiency was tested by the T7E1 method (see Guschin, D. Y. et al. Methods Mol. Biol. 649, 247-256 (2010))).

2.2 Result

The result is shown in FIG. 2. In the experiment of transfecting cells with AAVS1-AS2 and pST-Cas9 plasmids, compared with the mock (blank control) group, the gene modification rate of the no-drug group was 22.4% and 35.1%, while the gene modification rate of the group with Compounds 115 and 48 was 0%, and the gene modification rate of the group with Compound 49 was <1%.

In the experiment of transfecting cells with EMX1 and pST-Cas9 plasmids, compared with the mock group, the gene modification rate of the no-drug group was 26.5% and 27.9%, while the gene modification rate of the group with Compound 48 was 0%, the gene modification rate of the group with Compound 115 was ≤1.5%, and the gene modification rate of the group with Compound 49 was 5.6% and 3.8%.

Therefore, Compounds 49, 115 and 48 can inhibit the gene editing activity of SpyCas9 expressed by the plasmid on multiple genes.

### Example 3. Compound 49 Enhances the Specificity of SpyCas9-Based Gene Editing

3.1 Method SpyCas9 was lipid transfected into HEK293 cells or nuclear transfected into K562 cells to determine the effect of compound 49 on the specificity of SpyCas9 in multiple cell lines on different genes. The inhibitor was added to the culture 6 hours after transfection. The detection method is the same as in Example 2.

3.2 Result

As shown in FIG. 3, in HEK293 cells, when no compound was added, the ratio of the number of scheduled gene editing at specific sites to the number of scheduled gene editing at non-specific sites was 2.4, while after Compound 49 was added, the ratio of the number of scheduled gene editing at specific sites to the number of scheduled gene editing at non-specific sites was 7, which was raised by 2.9-fold, which shows that Compound 49 improved the specificity of SpyCas9.

### Example 4. Inhibitory Activity of Compound 49 to Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9)

4.1 Method

The method of this example was similar to 2.1, except that pST-Cas9 was replaced with a plasmid containing SaCas9. The detection method was the same as in Example 2.

4.2 Result

As shown in FIG. 4, when compared with the mock group, the gene modification rate of the group without drug was 14%, while the gene modification rate of the group added with Compound 49 was <0.5%, which indicates that Compound 49 can also inhibit the activity of SaCas9 expressed by plasmids in cell culture experiment.

### Example 5. The Inhibitory Activity of Compounds Modified on the Basis of Compound 49 on Gene Editing

5.1 Method

In order to further prove the malleability of the compound, the inventors tested the analogs of Compound 49 (901-905) to determine their effects on gene editing. The method of this example was the same as in Example 2.

5.2 Result

The result was shown in FIG. 5. Compared with the no-drug group (editing efficiency was 4.8%), Compounds 901-905 and Compound 49 can significantly reduce gene editing efficiency. This indicates that these test compounds would inhibit the gene editing activity of SpyCas9.

### Example 6. Compound 49 Regulates the Base Editing System

6.1 Method

HEK293T cells (105 cells/well) were seeded on a 24-well plate. 24 hours after inoculation, cells were transfected with 250 ng sgRNA expression plasmid and 500 ng dCas9-DNMT3a-DNMT31 plasmid system in Opti-MEM medium. 6 hours after transfection, DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 500 nM drug (Compound 49) was used to replace Opti-MEM. The positive control was DMEM containing 10% FBS with an equal volume of DMSO solvent control instead of Opti-MEM. 48 h after transfection, cell genomic DNA was extracted, and deep sequencing was performed after PCR amplification of the sgRNA targeting sequence.

6.2 Result

The result was shown in FIG. 6. Through deep sequencing results, it was found that KPT drug (Compound 49) can effectively reduce the on-target cleavage of different sgRNAs, and can be used as an “off-switch” to regulate the base editing system.

Specifically, for the C on 5th site, when sg47 was used, the C→T conversion frequency was reduced from 18% to 9%, of which the decrease rate was 50%.

### Example 7. Improvement of Base Editing Specificity by Compound 49

7.1 Method

The method of this example was the same as in Example 6.1.

7.2 Result

The result was shown in FIG. 7. Through the deep sequencing results, it was found that the KPT drug (Compound 49) has a higher inhibition ability to out-of-window activity, thus improving the specificity of base editing.

Specifically, when sgMSSK1-5 was used, the C→T conversion inhibition efficiency was 30% for the C on 5th site in the window; for the C on 11th site out-of-window, the C→T conversion inhibition efficiency was 50%. The inhibition rate on 11th site was greater than on 5th site.

### Example 8. Base Indel Editing of Compound 49

8.1 Method

The method of this example was the same as in Example 6.1.

8.2 Result

The result was shown in FIG. 8. Through the results of deep sequencing, it was found that the KPT drug (Compound 49) inhibited the indel of base editing, i.e. improving the specificity of base editing.

Specifically, when sg48 was used, the indel frequency was reduced overall without changing the sg48 targeted 20 bp mutation pattern.
