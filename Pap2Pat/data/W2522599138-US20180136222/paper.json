    "abstract": "Glucose-regulated protein94 (Grp94), the most represented endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident heat shock protein (HSP), is a tumor antigen shared by different types of solid and hematological tumors. The tumor-specific feature of Grp94 is its translocation from the ER to the cell surface where it displays pro-oncogenic functions. This un-physiological location has important implications for both the tumor pathology and anti-tumor therapy. We wanted to address the question of whether Grp94 could be measured as liquid marker in cancer patients in order to make predictions of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance for the tumor. To this aim, we performed an in-depth investigation on patients with primary tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, using different methodological approaches to detect Grp94 in tumor tissues, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results indicate that Grp94 is not only the antigen highly expressed in any tumor tissue and in cells of tumor infiltrates, mostly B lymphocytes, but it is also found in the circulation. However, the only form in which Grp94 was detected in the plasma of any patients and in B lymphocytes induced to proliferate, was that of stable complexes with Immunoglobulin (Ig)G. Using a specific immune-enzyme assay to measure plasma Grp94-IgG complexes, we showed that Grp94-IgG complexes were significantly increased in cancer patients compared to healthy control subjects, serving as diagnostic tumor biomarker. Results also demonstrate that the stimulation of patient PBMCs with Grp94-IgG complexes led to an increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines that might drive a potentially beneficial anti-tumor effect.",

                "A lot of experimental evidence has so far been accumulated to show that Grp94, the most abundant ER-resident HSP, plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of different types of tumors, both solid and hematological [1\u20137]. The ER stress and the increased metabolic demand associated with the intense, uncontrolled cell proliferation are a potent stimulus for inducing the expression of HSPs, mostly those residing in the ER, deputed to maintain the cellular homeostasis [8]. As a molecular chaperone, Grp94 is involved in the process of protein quality control of a specific and limited set of proteins [9], including the maturation and the correct assembly of IgG [10]. However, besides chaperoning cellular proteins, a property also shared with other HSPs, Grp94 has a peculiar, important role in modulating the activity of the immune system since it assists the MHC class I molecules in the antigen presentation, thus inducing the maturation and activation of various cells involved in both the innate and adaptive immune response [11]. In performing this specific function, Grp94 loses its ER-retention sequence and trans-locates to the cell membrane where it assumes different functions [12\u201314]; in particular, it behaves as a potent cytokine and controls, among others, the maturation of proteins involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation, modulating the activity of specific cellular signaling pathways [8].",
                "Cell-surface Grp94 has been taken as specific indicator of tumor malignancy, more reliable than other ER Grps and HSP90 in predicting the aggressiveness and invasiveness of the tumor itself [15, 16]. Correlation between over-expression of Grp94 and clinic-pathology of the tumor has been described especially in tumors of the GI tract [4, 14, 17\u201319], but also in non-small-cell lung carcinoma [15] and in hematological tumors [6]. Since Grp94 is crucially involved in the regulation of multiple steps of tumorigenesis and is often induced in tumors that have developed resistance to the conventional chemotherapy [8, 20], it has become an attractive target for both drugs and vaccine development to combat tumor growth and recurrence [12, 21, 22]. The fact that the expression on cell surface and even the secretion of Grp94 can only occur in malignant but not normal cells, offers the unique opportunity to specifically target the protein to halt the tumor progression in a much safer manner compared to the conventional anti-cancer therapy. At the same time, identification of Grp94 as tumor antigen renders Grp94 a protein suitable for developing specific anti-cancer therapeutic vaccines [20, 23, 24]. However, in order to progress in any of the Grp94-specific anti-tumor therapies it is mandatory to obtain preliminary information about the level of the Grp94 expression that only can help predict the therapeutic success [25]. Although an increasing number of scientific papers points to Grp94 as the most diffuse tumor biomarker and reliable index of the malignancy and negative prognosis of the tumor, no one has so far addressed the question of how to measure the protein in plasma or other biological fluids, the condition that could confer on Grp94 the validity of a tumor biomarker of clinical utility. The difficulty in performing such measurements depends on the particular structural and functional properties displayed by Grp94 when exposed in the extra-cellular environment, especially in plasma where it is found only in stable complexes with IgG [26\u201328]. Indeed, it has been observed that when exposed outside the cell, Grp94 rapidly binds to IgG through non-immune, stable binding at specific binding sites [29, 30]. Complexes that thus form acquire a long life span and display important immune-inflammatory properties [26, 29].",
                "We wanted to handle the issue of how Grp94 can spread from cancer cells, where it is expressed as tumor antigen, into the circulation, becoming a measurable diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarker whose expression might also be exploited to predict an immune-modulating activity of therapeutic utility. To this aim, we performed a thorough investigation on patients with different tumors of the GI tract, to detect and measure Grp94 expression in both tumor specimens and blood, also testing the response that immune circulating cells of patients might have under the challenge with Grp94. Our results indicate that Grp94 is liberated from cancer cells into plasma where it can be measured in form of complexes with IgG whose expression is significantly increased in cancer patients with respect to the normal counterpart. Results also reveal that Grp94 in complex with IgG can drive an inflammatory response in circulating immune cells consistent with a potentially beneficial anti-tumor effect."

                        "The characteristics of patients and tumors are listed in Table 1. No significant differences were found between males and females for age, stage and grade of tumors (Table 1). The majority of patients (70%), irrespective of gender, had adenocarcinomas of the large bowel, characterized by a prevalent mucinous component and a variable extension to pericolic fat. Gastric tumors were both tubular-type adenocarcinomas and signet ring cell carcinomas, whereas tumors of oesophagus and of the gastro-oesophageal junction were a squamous cell carcinoma and an adenocarcinoma, respectively. To see whether Grp94 was the tumor antigen shared by any patient irrespective of the anatomical site and stage of the tumor, we performed histo-immunochemistry (IHC) analysis on any sample of tumor tissue (and its normal counterpart), and measured Grp94 in patients\u2019 plasma. IHC revealed an intense positivity for Grp94 in the tumor tissue of any patient (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1) with the exception of one single patient (female, with G2 adenocarcinoma of rectum) whose tumor infiltrate however stained positively for Grp94 (Supplementary Figure S1). Apparently, Grp94 staining did not show any significant association with both tumor stage (p = 0.39) and grading (p = 0.45), although tumors at later stages (p = 0.0074), but not of higher grade (p = 0.34) showed a stronger expression of Grp94 (Table 2). At variance with what observed in the normal counterpart of any tissue sample, in which the expression of constitutive Grp94 was inconstantly and weakly evidenced in the cell, in tumor tissue Grp94 was also localized on the apical part of the cell (Supplementary Figure S1) and was also found in the extracellular secretion. This was in keeping with previous results showing that under inflammatory stimuli, including the neoplastic transformation, Grp94 trans-locates from ER to the cell membrane acquiring the function to sustain the growth and the diffusion of tumor [12, 14]. Interestingly also, in any tumor tissue, irrespective of the histological type and anatomical site, a diffuse cellular infiltrate was apparent that intensely stained for Grp94 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting the involvement of the lymphocyte population in taking up and spreading the antigen protein. To investigate this aspect further, we found that cells of tumor infiltrates were for the most part represented by B lymphocytes, as evidenced by staining with anti-CD20+ Abs (Figure 1B), and that in a double immune-staining for both Grp94 and CD20+, the cells positive for Grp94 were mostly plasma cells, easily identified for their typical morphological aspect (Figure 1B, arrows in right panels of higher enlargement)."

                        "Since the marked positivity for Grp94 in cells of tumor infiltrates, especially B cells, supported the possibility that Grp94 could also be disseminated into the circulation, our next step was to measure Grp94 in patients\u2019 plasma to see whether such measurement could be index of the tumor burden and diffusion, thus representing a useful biomarker. Previous works had stably demonstrated that when liberated in the extracellular milieu - as it also occurs in autoimmune diseases [27, 31] - Grp94 is never detected as a single protein, but is always found linked in big, stable complexes with IgG [26, 28]. To explore the possibility that Grp94-IgG complexes could also circulate in cancer patients, we first tested any single plasma sample with anti-Grp94 Abs in Western blotting (WB) (Figure 2A). While no immune reaction for Grp94 was detected in healthy control subjects (Supplementary Figure S2A), as also verified previously [28], Grp94 was instead present in the plasma of any patient with a variable degree of intensity, some patients showing an elevated burden of the protein (Figure 2A). Grp94 was always detected at molecular masses (> 200 kDa) consistent with the formation of big complexes, and in co-immunostaining with anti-human IgG Abs we verified that Grp94 was actually linked in complexes with IgG (Figure 2A).",
                        "Since WB does not permit to make any inference about the concentration of the protein detected, nor can it be used for diagnostic screening, we developed a sandwich ELISA to obtain a reliable measurement of Grp94 in plasma. The assay was based on the principle that after binding to circulating IgG to form stable non-immune complexes, Grp94 can still bind immune (anti-Grp94) IgG Abs. Indeed, it has been ascertained that binding of Grp94 to non-immune IgG occurs at sites other than the antigen-binding sites, involving a specific portion of the Grp94 molecule [30]. In our ELISA, anti-Grp94 (capture) Abs were used to detect antigenic sites of Grp94 bound to IgG, while anti-IgG (detection) Abs could reveal IgG linked to Grp94 in the complex. Positivity of the reaction could thus occur if Grp94 was present in the complex with IgG. By measuring the optical density of the immune reaction for circulating Grp94-IgG complexes, a highly significant increase was noted in plasma of patients with respect to healthy control subjects (Figure 2B). Of note is the finding that the highest values of optical density for Grp94-IgG complexes were found in patients whose plasma also showed the most intense immune reaction for Grp94 in WB, a result that supported the reliability of measurements made with the immunoassay. Apparently, among patients tested, there was no significant difference in the Grp94-IgG complex concentration as far as the site of tumor is concerned (Figure 2B, lower panel), but the highest values of optical density belonged to patients with tumors at the more advanced stages with the involvement of lymph nodes."

                        "To further investigate the issue of the involvement of B lymphocytes as cells of tumor infiltrates mostly responsible for taking up Grp94 and presenting it in association with IgG, we set up experiments in which PBMCs of patients were cultured with the Pokeweed mitogen (PWM). PWM is used as specific stimulatory agent of B cell proliferation and Ig secretion, being able to induce the transformation of CD20+ cells into CD20\u2212 Ab-secreting cells [32]. Thus, if B cells of patients actually encountered and captured Grp94 as tumor antigen, then, activation by PWM would also cause an increased expression of Grp94. After challenging PBMCs with PWM for ten days, cells were lysed and Grp94 detected in WB. To exclude that stimulation with the mitogen could induce an increase in the expression of other HSPs also identified as tumor antigens [15, 33] we measured the expression of both HSP90 and Grp78 in cell lysates. As shown in Figure 2 (panel C), incubation with PWM led to a marked rise in the Grp94 expression that, at variance with what occurred in the corresponding un-stimulated control in which Grp94 appeared at its expected molecular mass (100 kDa for the monomer, and 200 kDa for the dimer in non-reducing conditions), was found at higher molecular masses testifying the formation of big complexes (Figure 2C). That Grp94 was also linked to IgG in PWM-stimulated PBMCs was confirmed by WB for IgG in which bands positive for Grp94 also stained for IgG (Supplementary Figure S2B). No positivity was instead detected for either HSP90 or Grp78 in PBMCs stimulated with PWM (Supplementary Figure S2C), a result that confirmed the specificity of Grp94 as tumor antigen also present in B cells of cancer patients."

                        "If the soluble form of the tumor antigen was Grp94 in complexes with IgG, then, it would be expected that by challenging patients\u2019 PBMCs with the antigen at proper concentrations could induce the activation of immune cells followed by an inflammatory response possibly directed against the cells presenting the antigen. To verify that Grp94 added to the culture medium of PBMCs was not present as free protein but only in complexes with IgG contained in FBS of the medium (see Methods), we set up preliminary experiments in which Grp94 at the highest concentration (100 ng/ml) was incubated with the culture medium in presence of 10% FBS, and positivity for Grp94 then tested in WB (Figure 2D). As expected, in absence of serum and without incubation, control Grp94 focused at its molecular mass of about 100 kDa, whereas after incubation with FBS, Grp94 was visible only at molecular weight that confirmed its stable binding with IgG (Figure 2D). It is also known that in absence of serum even a short incubation at 37\u00b0C causes the complete degradation of Grp94, a reason for which binding to IgG stabilizes and prolongs the activity of Grp94 in solution [30]. Thus, having proved that Grp94 in culture medium of PBMCs was present in complexes with IgG, we incubated PBMCs with Grp94 at the final concentrations of both 10 and 100 ng/ml, and analyzed the morphological characteristics of cells at the optical microscope. The entity of the inflammatory response was also evaluated by measuring the concentrations of a set of cytokines in the PBMC supernatant. After ten days incubation with Grp94, PBMCs showed peculiar morphological characteristics markedly different from the basal morphology of untreated PBMCs (Figure 3). Despite the expected inter-individual variability, mostly pertaining to quantitative aspects of the morphological changes, the common denominator of every picture in any patient was the appearance of numerous big cells with expanded cytoplasm and of heterogeneous shape, often clustered in agglomerates, suggestive of an accelerated rate of monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, mostly evident at 100 ng/ml of Grp94. The quantitative analysis of the morphological transformation induced by Grp94 on PBMCs was evaluated by counting the number of big cells per field following the treatment compared to those in the corresponding, untreated control (Table 3). Although such a measurement was possible only in seventeen patients - the remaining ten patients shared a pattern of Grp94-induced big agglomerates of indistinct cells \u2013 a significantly higher number of transformed cells was found in Grp94-treated PBMCs, regardless of the gender of patients (Table 3)."

                        "It has been reported that when human monocytes are co-cultured with tumor cells from colorectal cancer patients they differentiate into macrophages that display an inflammatory, anti-tumor phenotype [34]. To test whether the appearance of numerous macrophages in the PBMC population following the challenge with Grp94 was consistent with the activation of an inflammatory response, we measured cytokines in cell media after two days incubation with Grp94. This end-point was useful to detect almost all the cytokines under investigation with the exception of IL-4 the concentration of which fell below the limit of detection in almost all patients, a fact that led to the exclusion of this cytokine in the following analyses. As shown in Figure 4 (left panels), in which effects on cytokine secretion by 100 ng/ml of Grp94 are graphed in box-plots, and in Supplementary Table S1, reporting the original data with both 10 and 100 ng/ml of Grp94, there was a concentration-dependent stimulatory effect of Grp94 on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines with the exception of IFN\u03b3. Although IFN\u03b3 apparently did not change when all patients were analyzed together, in the sub-group of females there was a marked stimulation of IFN\u03b3 whose concentration rose from a median basal value of 1.39 pg/ml to 7.46 at 100 ng/ml Grp94 (Supplementary Table S1). IL-6 was the cytokine maximally stimulated by Grp94 especially 100 ng/ml, whereas increases in the concentration of other cytokines, though relevant, were not significantly different from basal values due to the large dispersion of values and the limited number of patients analyzed in each subgroup (Figure 4, left panels). However, it has to be noted that the increase in the cytokine secretion observed in all patients was almost exclusively sustained by female patients in whom the dose-dependent effect of Grp94 was more evident (Supplementary Table S1), a result that suggested a sex-dependent reactivity of PBMCs to the stimulation of Grp94.",
                        "When patients were grouped by tumor stage, the most evident result was the significant reduction of the basal secretion of any cytokine in patients with tumors at more advanced stages (III/IV) with respect to those with tumors at stage I/II (Figure 4, panels on right and Supplementary Table S2), to suggest that a defective immune response might occur as the disease progresses. Analyzing the Grp94 effect on cytokine secretion in these subgroups of patients, IL-6 turned out to be still the cytokine that underwent marked increases, though not statistically significant (Figure 4, panels on right, Supplementary Table S2)."

                        "It has been reported that a significant infiltration of B lymphocyte-derived Ig commonly occurs in pre-malignant and malignant stroma of several solid human cancers [35] and that cancer, but not normal cells express high levels of IgG that promote the proliferation and the diffusion of the tumor [36]. Both tumor and circulating complexes of Ig are associated with an increased tumor burden and poor prognosis [37], a reason for which targeting B cells for reducing the aberrant Ig production has been proposed as a useful therapeutic approach in different human tumors [35\u201337]. In the light of these observations and of the significant infiltration of B cells and Grp94-positive plasma cells found in tumor stroma of our patients, we wanted to explore the effect of Grp94 on IgG production by PBMCs. A concentration-dependent, statistically significant reduction of the IgG concentration in cell media was observed with Grp94 in all patients and also in males and females considered separately (Figure 4, panels on left and Supplementary Table S1). In particular, in male patients, Grp94 caused similar median reductions of 26% and 25% at 10 and 100 ng/ml, respectively, whereas in females a clearer concentration-dependent effect of Grp94 was apparent, with median reductions of 27% and 38% at 10 and 100 ng/ml of Grp94, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Similar, concentration-dependent and significant reductions in IgG were observed with Grp94 when data were analyzed in patients grouped for stage of the tumor (Figure 4, panels on right and Supplementary Table S2).",

Considering the relatively small sample size and the fact that variables were expressed on different scales with several outlier values, we focused on values of partial correlations computed on the original data, fixing a reasonably high correlation value, equal or greater than 0.70. By applying this robust method, it turned out that both in the whole group of patients and even more in the subgroups of males and females there was not any significant correlation among the variables considered. Apparently thus, the effect of Grp94 to inhibit the IgG secretion was independent of the stimulatory effect on the cytokines."

                "In this work we wanted to address some specific, still unmet questions of clinical relevance, related to the role of Grp94 as tumor antigen. Besides confirming that Grp94 is the tumor antigen shared by different histological types of tumors of the GI tract, we proved that it can be measured in plasma of cancer patients in complexes with IgG, serving as diagnostic tumor biomarker with the additional property to modulate the inflammatory response in circulating immune cells. Results of IHC analysis demonstrated that Grp94 was intensely expressed in any tumor tissue irrespective of the anatomical site of the tumor that included oesophagus, the gastro-oesophageal junction and the large bowel (colon, sigma and rectum) (Figure 1 and Table 2). Although the immune reaction for Grp94 did not show any significant association with both tumor stage and grading, a more intense Grp94 expression was associated with most advanced tumor stages (Table 2). These results were in keeping with several others observations pointing to Grp94 as the most common antigen protein in a large number of both solid and hematological tumors [4\u20137, 15, 39]. Among the proteins identified as reliable markers of cancer, including other HSPs such as Grp78 and HSP90 [15, 33], Grp94 appears to be the most reliable for predicting cancer invasiveness, recurrence and metastasis, being thus linked to a negative prognosis of the tumor [15, 17, 18, 40]. The role of Grp94 as pro-oncogenic chaperone has been demonstrated in both animal and human cancer cells [12, 14, 41] where translocation of Grp94 from the ER to cell membrane has been demonstrated to be a tumor-specific feature with implications for the regulation of tumor proteins involved in the transmission of oncogenic signal [12]. The cell surface appearance of Grp94 has important clinical consequences since Grp94 might thus become an easily accessible therapeutic target [8, 12]. Besides adding further evidence to these observations, with the demonstration that Grp94 often appeared in the apical portion of cancer cells, our results also revealed that Grp94 markedly stained cells of tumor infiltrates (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1) strongly suggesting that the protein could be disseminated into the circulation. This finding was closely related to the question of whether and how Grp94 could be detected and measured as soluble tumor antigen, the only condition that permits to establish the validity of a protein as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.",
                "We were able to demonstrate that Grp94 actually circulates in the plasma of cancer patients in complexes with IgG, the exclusive form in which Grp94 has been found in circulation when it is liberated outside the cell in pathological conditions [26\u201328]. Western blot analysis showed that Grp94 was present in the plasma of any patient, with inter-individual variability in the expression to indicate that some patients had a higher level of the protein with respect to others (Figure 2A). However, the immune reaction for Grp94 always appeared at molecular masses consistent with the formation of big, SDS-resistant complexes that the specific immune reaction confirmed to be formed with IgG (Figure 2A), as also previously reported [26\u201328]. That Grp94 in complexes with IgG was the soluble tumor antigen in cancer patients was further confirmed by an enzyme-linked immune assay specifically developed to address the need to measure Grp94-IgG complexes in human plasma as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. The measurements with this ELISA actually proved that Grp94-IgG complexes were statistically more elevated in cancer patients with respect to healthy control subjects (Figure 2B), showing in addition that the site of tumor did not influence significantly the value of Grp94-IgG complexes. Of particular interest was the observation that the highest value of Grp94-IgG complexes (largely exceeding the median value) was measured in a patient who died after only two months from the analysis, strongly suggesting that the massive burden of the protein present in the plasma of this patient was expression of the higher rate of proliferation and metastatic diffusion of cancer cells.",
                "The analysis on cells of tumor infiltrates allowed us to shed further light on the mechanisms contributing to the diffusion of the tumor antigen into the circulation. We verified that the most part of cells infiltrating any tumor specimen were B cells (Figure 1B), a result in keeping with similar recent observations made by others in different types of solid tumors [37]. Recruitment of B cells in the tumor environment is consistent with the role of antigen-presenting cells played by B lymphocytes [42] that, by taking up and presenting tumor antigen(s) on the surface, actively contribute to spread the tumor [35, 37]. Moreover, B lymphocytes present at the site of tumor are responsible for the production of Abs developed against the antigen(s) exposed on the surface or liberated from cancer cells [43]. We showed that Grp94-positive cells in tumor infiltrates were mostly plasma cells (Figure 1B), to suggest that following the capture of Grp94, B cells were induced to differentiate into Ab-secreting cells, a condition that thus rendered possible the detection of the antigen in the IHC analysis. That Grp94 was expressed at higher level in Ig-secreting B cells was confirmed by the experiments in which we exposed patients\u2019 PBMCs to the challenge with PWM used to specifically induce a proliferative response in B lymphocytes [32]. In this condition, commonly used as positive control for testing the IgG production in the PBMC population [44], the Grp94 expression not only rose significantly in PBMCs but was always found at elevated molecular masses (Figure 2C) also justified by the association of Grp94 with IgG (Supplementary Figure S2B). It is tempting to speculate that IgG Abs developed in Grp94-positive plasma cells might be either immune, i.e., directed against Grp94 itself, or non-immune, as those that were shown to form stable complexes with Grp94 at site other than the antigen-binding site [30]. The latter possibility seems more probable since immune complexes are reversible in nature and under denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE they dissociate, whereas in PBMCs we never found Grp94 at the expected molecular mass of the protein.",
                "It has been observed that IgG Abs that are often found increased in tumor compared to corresponding normal tissues instead of driving an anti-tumor effect turn out to be pathogenic, since they promote tumor growth and invasiveness, and are thus correlated with a poor tumor prognosis [35\u201337, 45, 46]. The experimental evidence accumulated so far indicates that B cells infiltrating tumors have a pro-tumorigenic role sustained by complexes that the pathogenic IgG can exert distally, a reason for which targeting B cells for reducing the IgG production has been considered a useful therapeutic target to halt tumor progression [35, 43]. Our finding showing that circulating Grp94-IgG complexes were markedly increased in cancer patients would thus be in accord with the proposed pathogenic role of these complexes as they not only are responsible for the antigen spreading, but per se also drive inflammatory angiogenic potential, as previously demonstrated on vascular cells [27].",
                "The identification of a specific tumor antigen is the prerequisite for developing a vaccine to use against that tumor, and a great deal of effort has been made to develop therapeutic vaccines, including those based on Grp94 as either subsidiary or alternative therapeutic option to the chemotherapeutic agents for the cure of different tumors [8, 20, 23, 24]. Based on this principle, and considering that our results indicated that Grp94 in complexes with IgG was the soluble form of the tumor antigen, we wanted to test the immune response in PBMCs of cancer patients challenged with Grp94, at both 10 and 100 ng/ml. Previous results indicated that irrespective of the nature of IgG, Grp94 can rapidly bind to, and form stable complexes with IgG, and we actually proved that this occurred with IgG of FBS of the culture medium (Figure 2D), so that effects measured on PBMCs after the addition of Grp94 could only be attributable to the complexes that it forms with IgG. Under this experimental condition, PBMCs underwent a series of morphological and functional modifications that in some aspects appeared to be also dependent on the gender of patients. Thus, whereas PBMCs of both male and female patients showed similar qualitative changes, characterized by the appearance of macrophages of different dimensions and shape often assembled in clusters (Figure 3), the response was markedly different as far as the cytokine secretion was concerned (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S1). Only female patients were responsible for the rise in the concentration of the cytokines observed in all patients in the presence of Grp94, whereas in the group of males the value of any cytokine, with the only exception of IL-6, did not change with respect to the basal value (Figure 4). Apparently, thus, PBMCs of females displayed a particular sensitivity to the same Grp94 concentrations that in males instead caused little or no effects at all, and the cytokines that in female PBMCs underwent the highest stimulation were, in decreasing order of intensity, IL-6, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 (Supplementary Table S1). Since it is known that IL-10 exerts an inhibitory effect on the secretion of both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 from human monocytes [47, 48], the increase of IL-10 can only be interpreted as the response to the secretion of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 developed in order to counterbalance the inflammatory effect of these two cytokines. Macrophages are critical source of TNF\u03b1 [49, 50] and, in particular, macrophages that infiltrate the tumor and circulate in colorectal cancer patients are identified as pro-inflammatory, being able to mediate tumor cell killing by the antigen-driven secretion of both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 [34, 49, 51]. Furthermore, the expression of immune cell-derived TNF\u03b1 has recently been recognized as the most important predictor of the positive anti-tumor response attributed to TNF\u03b1 in colorectal cancer [52]. Our results would thus be consistent with an antigen-driven activation of circulating macrophages that are induced to secrete inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, potentially associated with an anti-tumor effect. In line with this possibility is the potent inhibitory effect exerted by Grp94-IgG complexes on the IgG secretion (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S1). This effect was stably significant regardless of whether the analysis was made on all patients or in patients grouped by sex or stage of tumor (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S2). Although we cannot exclude that Grp94-IgG complexes might have a direct effect on B cells, other observations would rather favor the alternative possibility of an indirect, mostly TNF\u03b1-mediated mechanism. First, in a previous work we reported that Grp94, added to PBMCs in the same experimental conditions as the present ones, could significantly reduce the IgG secretion in human PBMCs only when Grp94 was the antigen expressed by immune cells, and this effect did not involve B lymphocytes directly [53]. Second, TNF\u03b1 produced by macrophages is known to suppress the development of human B cells into Ig-producing cells with the consequent inhibition of Ig secretion [54]. In response to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, a subset of B cells arises to produce IL-10 in order to counteract inflammation and keep the immune system in check [55]. Thus, the mechanism by which Grp94-IgG complexes might activate the inflammatory, anti-tumor response in PBMCs of cancer patients would predict that activated macrophages secrete both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 that, besides mutually reinforcing their own secretion [50], affect B lymphocytes, causing both the inhibition of the IgG production and the reactive anti-inflammatory secretion of IL-10 (Figure 5).",
                "In conclusion, our results besides adding further evidence in support of Grp94 as the shared tumor antigen in tumors of the GI tract, prove that it can be measured in plasma as valuable diagnostic marker of disease in the form of complexes with IgG that also exert immune-modulating activities on circulating immune cells. Although further studies are necessary to corroborate our results, extending the investigation to other types of tumors and involving a larger number of patients, our study nevertheless clearly indicates that Grp94 in complexes with IgG can both stimulate the secretion of specific inflammatory cytokines and mostly inhibit the production of IgG in PBMCs of cancer patients, both these effects having predictable positive implications for halting the tumor growth in vivo."
