                        "In the strenuous, continuous effort to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of tumors and to find the most effective anti-tumor therapies, a particular attention has recently been focused on a group of intra-cellular proteins, \u201cGlucose-regulated proteins\u201d (Grps) belonging to the family of the \u201cHeat Shock Proteins\u201d (HSPs). As suggested by the name, the expression of these proteins is induced by diverse stress stimuli, both intra- and extra-cellular, such as hypoglycemia, hypoxia, viral infections, cell proliferation, and the genetic defects that lead to accumulation of structurally altered proteins (Lee A. S., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2014; 14: 263-276). At variance with other HSPs that are prevalently confined to the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus, Grps are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site specifically deputed to defend the cell against stress stimuli. The most important Grp, not only for being the most abundant in the ER, is Grp94 that, similarly to other Grps, is constitutively expressed in any cell but is actively transcribed under stress conditions (Eletto D., et al., Sem. Cell & Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 479-485). Besides displaying the activity shared by other HSPs, i.e., to confer on nascent proteins the correct conformation and to favor degradation of altered proteins, Grp94 also possesses the unique property to modulate the immune system (Randow F. and Seed B., Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 891-896; Wu S., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 6735-6742). This specific function is due to the capacity of Grp94 to load cellular antigenic peptides that are to be exposed to the cell surface and presented to immune-competent cells in order to induce an antigen-specific immune response (Chhanda B., et al., Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 1147-57).",
                        "A lot of papers have so far been published that also stress the role of Grp94 in the pathogenesis of tumors, both solid and hematological (Feldweg A. M. and Srivastava P., Int. J. Cancer 1995; 63: 310-314; Boelens J., et al., Leukemia Res. 2013; 37: 3-8). The intense proliferation characterizing the tumor cells not only induces the over-expression of Grp94 but also causes the translocation of Grp94 from the ER to the cell surface. Indeed, by binding antigenic peptides Grp94 loses a particular C-terminal amino acidic sequence that is responsible for the retention of the protein in the ER (Capitani M., Sallese M., FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3863-3871). With the loss of the physiological intra-cellular location and the appearance on the cell surface (and also in the extra-cellular space), Grp94 acquires new, different functions. It behaves as a potent cytokine with inflammatory and immune effects that influence the cell growth and invasiveness, and modulate the cell signaling systems (Lee A. S., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2014; 14: 263-276; Tramentozzi E., et al., Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3639-3648). The role of Grp94 in the development and progression of tumors has been demonstrated in a large number of investigations (Zheng H-C., et al., Human Pathol. 2008; 39:1042-1049; Takahashi H., et al., Histol. Histopathol. 2011; 26: 663-671; Dejeans N., et al., Free Rad. Biol. & Med. 2012; 52: 993-1002). The fact that Grp94 is recognized as one of the most diffuse antigens expressed in tumors of various types and at different stages of evolution, makes this HSP be not only a useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease but also a potential therapeutic target (Sch\u00f6ntal A. H., et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 85: 653-666; Slotta-Huspenina J., et al., PloSone 2012; doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0041420). Indeed, the exposure of Grp94 on the surface of cancer but not of healthy cells, offers the opportunity to achieve a cancer-specific therapy without damaging healthy tissues/organs. In this respect, several research groups have realized various strategic approaches to target the protein with molecules that, despite their distinct chemical properties, could all block the Grp94 function to sustain the growth and spreading of the tumor (Patel P. D., et al., Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 677-682; Lee A. S., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2014; 14: 263-276; Rachidi S., et al., J. Hepatol. 2014; 62: 879-888). A different therapeutic approach predicts that Grp94 can instead be employed as a tool to cure tumors and, following this indication, numerous Grp94-based vaccines have been developed that exploit the capacity of Grp94 to activate the immune function (Lee K. P., et al., Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 2006; 20: 637-659; Schreiber T. M., et al., Cancer Res. 2009; 69:2026-2033; Wang X-Y., et al., J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 6309-6319; Wang S., et al., Vaccine 2011; 29: 6342-6351). The aim of the vaccine-based therapeutic approach is therefore to induce in the patient an effective immune response against the tumor by directing cytotoxic lymphocytes against the cells presenting the antigen (Grp94) on their surface.",
                        "From this premise it follows that in either one of the two therapeutic approaches, the pharmacological one, with molecules blocking the tumor-supporting functions of Grp94, or the immune stimulant approach, with a Grp94-based vaccine, the fundamental prerequisite is that Grp94 is easily detected as tumor antigen. Thus, it is rather strange that no diagnostic tool has so far been developed to measure Grp94 in blood and other biological fluids. Indeed, the numerous ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent assay) kits presently available on the market for the measurement of Grp94 are conceived and delivered for the research purpose only. However, in order to consider Grp94 a tumor biomarker of diagnostic value and also of utility for predicting the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy, it is necessary that Grp94 can be measured as a circulating antigen."

                        "The experiments that allowed us to conceive and set up an immune-detection method useful for measuring Grp94 in biological fluids to diagnostic purpose, originated from previous works performed on plasma of type 1 diabetic subjects, with the demonstration that Grp94 was present in plasma in high concentrations and always in complexes with IgG (Pagetta A., et al., Diabetologia 2003; 46: 996-1006; Pagetta A., et al. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2870-2883). The presence of Grp94 in the blood of diabetic subjects had a clear pathological meaning, being the proof of ongoing cell damage induced by the autoimmune process responsible for the onset of type 1 diabetes (Pagetta A., et al. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2870-2883). The finding that Grp94 was present in complexes with IgG was attributed to the property of extra-cellular Grp94 to behave as potent immunogen, with the capacity to stimulate the production of specific antibodies, a reason for which the complexes were initially identified as immune in nature (Tramentozzi E., et al., J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 1336-47). However, in following in vitro experiments it was ascertained that Grp94 was also able to bind IgG through a non-immune binding, that turned out to be particularly stable and resistant to several denaturing conditions (Tramentozzi E., et al., Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3639-3648; Pagetta A., et al., PloSone 2014; doi: 10.1371/journal.pone. 0086198). It was thus hypothesized that the same non-immune binding observed in vitro could also take place between Grp94 and IgG in vivo whenever Grp94 was liberated outside the cell, and that circulating complexes could therefore be prevalently non-immune in nature. A proteomic investigation conducted on the blood of diabetic subjects actually confirmed this hypothesis, showing that Grp94 present in the circulation was only that irreversibly linked to IgG through a non-immune linkage (Roveri A., et al., J. Diabetes Res. 2015; Article ID 815839). It is well known that in an immune complex the antigen-antibody linkage is reversible; thus, although it is reasonable to suppose that Grp94 can form immune complexes with IgG from which it can easily detach, the accumulated experimental evidence indicates that Grp94 cannot remain free for long, being rapidly and stably involved in a non-immune binding with IgG. These premises help understand why it was so difficult to measure circulating Grp94 using the ELISA method that is based on the principle to detect and measure a biological target through the antigenic recognition by specific antibodies. Indeed, the ELISA kits presently available on the market can detect and measure only the single protein (FIG. 1, A) like that obtained after purification from different biological sources, but they cannot give a reliable measurement of Grp94 as it actually is in vivo, i.e., in complexes with IgG. In our previous patent (Finotti P., Brevetto Nazionale 2007, N\u00b0PD2007A000252) dealing with the method followed to obtain in vitro the complexes of Grp94 with IgG, we claimed the potential therapeutic use of the complexes formed in vitro and the possible exploitation of these complexes to measure circulating antibodies against the complexes. In that patent, however, the in vitro formed complexes were predicted to be used exclusively as the capture agent in the ELISA method, but in no part of the patent the possibility was ever claimed to measure endogenous complexes as a marker of tumor and index of the extent of extra-cellular liberation of Grp94.",
                        "In a following document (www.bolsatecnologia.pt; TOIT20140423001), the use was claimed of an ELISA kit to measure endogenous Grp94-IgG complexes and antibodies against these complexes. However, the method ELISA described in that document implied the use of the Grp94-IgG complexes formed in vitro (matter of the National Patent 2007) and thus exploited a product and used a procedure of measurement different from those proposed in the present patent. When put to the test, the method described in the above document did not turn out to give satisfactory results, thus a new series of experiments was undertaken that led to the development of the method matter of the present patent. This new method does not employ any more the in vitro formed Grp94-IgG complexes to measure the immune reaction, and has allowed us to obtain a reliable quantitative measurement of the protein under exam."

The said secondary antibody is preferentially, but not exclusively, conjugated with an enzyme that makes the immune reaction be visible through the conversion of a specific substrate into a colored product detected by reading the absorbance at a specific wavelength.

Criteria for the enrollment of patients were that patients did not receive any prior anti-tumor treatment and that tumor was diagnosed for the first time. The study protocol was submitted to patients for their informed written approval. The protocol also included the drawing of a blood sample (15 ml) the day before the surgical intervention. A similar blood sample was also obtained from a sample of healthy control subjects recruited among those attending the Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences of the University of Padua (students and regular workers) after the subjects gave their informed written consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Regione Veneto.",
                        "The aim of the study was to see whether in the blood of patients Grp94 was detected in the form of complexes with IgG, thus validating the assumption that Grp94-IgG complexes could be a marker of tumor irrespective of the tumor type.",
                        "Plasma was obtained by centrifuging blood for 10 min at 3,500 rpm and after the protein concentration was determined on each plasma sample, plasma was stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. in aliquots ready to use. On each plasma sample, Western blot analysis was preliminarily performed to test the presence of Grp94; the analysis also served as reference for comparisons to be made with the measurements of Grp94 with the ELISA method. Although Western blotting is a sensitive and reliable method to detect a protein, it nevertheless gives only a qualitative measurement of the protein and cannot be used for screenings on a large scale given the laborious and expensive procedure, a reason for which its application is limited to the laboratory research only.",
                        "Preparation of the Biological Sample",
                        "The ELISA method used for the quantitative measurement of Grp94-IgG complexes was tested on plasma samples of both cancer patients and healthy control subjects. Each plasma sample was previously submitted to Western blot analysis to verify the presence of Grp94. Preliminary experiments were set up in which the plasma of some patients and of healthy control subjects was analyzed at scalar dilutions, in duplicate for each dilution, following the procedure described above (steps in \u201cDetailed Description of the Invention\u201d). Experiments were finalized to assess the pattern with which the immune reaction increased in intensity as a function of the plasma concentration and to establish the dilutions with which the reaction was linear. To this aim, a patient of reference was first chosen who developed a particularly intense reaction for Grp94 in the Western blot analysis, thus serving as positive control (FIG. 2, patient #11). The plasma of this patient was tested in parallel with that of a healthy control subject at scalar dilutions (from 1:516 to 1:16) (FIG. 3). It can be observed that only in the patient the absorbance (index of the intensity of the immune reaction for Grp94-IgG complexes) rose progressively and significantly by increasing the plasma concentration (expressed as decreasing values of dilution) up to reach the plateau at the lowest dilution of 1:16.",
                        "After this preliminary experiment, the analysis was performed on additional 5 patients whose plasma was used at the dilutions of 1:128, 1:32 and 1:16 corresponding to those that in the absorbance curve obtained with the plasma of the reference patient yielded a linear increase of the reaction. It was thus observed that in any patient, despite inter-individual variability, the intensity of the immune reaction increased linearly with the increase of the plasma concentration (FIG. 4). We then extended the analysis to other patients and control subjects to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the biological marker. To this aim, the ELISA test was conducted on plasma at the single dilution of 1:128 considered the most appropriate to include both highest and lowest measurements of the immune response expected to occur in the group of patients. The statistical analysis of data showed that the mean (\u00b1SEM) value of absorbance (in arbitrary units) in healthy control subjects was 0.34 (\u00b10.013) (range: 0.27-0.45) and in patients 0.796 (\u00b10.081) (range: 0.51-2.31); the difference between the means was statistically highly significant (p<0.0001) (FIG. 5). An elevated dispersion of values was observed in patients due to expected different concentrations of complexes in plasma, whereas control subjects had particularly low and homogeneous values of absorbance (FIG. 5). These results allowed us to fix the upper limit of absorbance (cut-off) in healthy control subjects to 0.45 units, a value that sharply separated healthy from diseased subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay calculated in our sample was thus 100%: all patients had values of absorbance higher than 0.5 units (no false negative) and no one of healthy control subjects had values higher than 0.45 (no false positive).",
                        "Since our patients had primary solid tumors originating from different anatomical sites in the gastro-enteric tract, and were thus non homogeneous for the type of tumor, it was of interest to analyze the measurements made with the ELISA test after patients were grouped for site of tumor (FIG. 6). The dispersion of values of the tumor marker noted when patients were analyzed together (FIG. 5) might have been attributable to differences in the tumor type. It was observed that there was not any significant difference among the means (and SEM) of values of patients grouped by tumor type (FIG. 6). Of note was the finding that the patient with the highest value of absorbance (i.e., the highest concentration of complexes in plasma) also had an exceptionally elevated value of circulating endothelial cancer cells (data not shown), to testify the extensive metastatic diffusion of the tumor. The same patient died two months after he underwent tumor excision and blood examination.",
                        "On the whole, results proved that the marker was a valuable diagnostic tool for tumors of the gastro-enteric tract irrespective of the tumor type. The marker can therefore be profitably employed to diagnostic and prognostic purposes of solid tumors of different histological type and anatomical site. As stated in the introductory part, the necessary condition that makes Grp94-IgG complexes fulfill the requisite of a tumor marker is that Grp94-IgG complexes can be detected as circulating antigen; such a condition is expected to be even better satisfied for hematological tumors, a reason for which Grp94-IgG complexes might assume the role of general tumor biomarker.",
                        "That the new ELISA method for measuring Grp94-IgG complexes in plasma satisfies the criteria of reliability and effectiveness is proved by the fact that measurements obtained with the new ELISA method fit results of Western blotting made on the same plasma samples (FIG. 2). Although the two methods cannot be compared since the Western blot analysis does not permit to make any quantitative inference about the entity of the immune reaction, it is nevertheless worth noting that patients with the highest values of absorbance were also those who in Western blot analysis displayed a more intense immune reaction for Grp94 (for example, patient #11).",
                        "In our investigation conducted on a relatively small number of patients, measurements of Grp94-IgG complexes are expressed as arbitrary units of absorbance, taken as index of the intensity of the immune reaction. However, the conversion into concentration units (ng/ml) of the complex can be easily obtained by reading the absorbance units of unknown plasma samples on the calibration curve constructed una tantum with known concentrations of the Grp94-IgG complex formed in vitro. The concentration read from the standard curve must then be corrected for the dilution factor."

Electrophoresis has been performed in denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) by loading on to an 8.5% polyacrylamide gel 10 \u03bcg proteins of each plasma sample in non-reducing conditions. Before loading, the protein concentration was determined on dialyzed plasma using a spectrophotometric method. Proteins were then blotted on to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bellerica, Mass., USA). After blocking the membrane with 10% milk, the membrane was treated with anti-Grp94 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Enzo Life Sciences) and then, after stripping of the membrane, with anti-human IgG sheep polyclonal antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, Tex., USA).
