                        "In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like quadrotors have drawn significant attention for several applications including search and rescue, transportation, and inspection due to their simplicity in design, agility, low cost, and ability to hover in place and move in 3D (Emran, et al., Annual Reviews in Control, 2018). Nevertheless, these robots are constrained by limited battery endurance which restrains their applicability in persistent, long-distance missions.",
                        "The ideal solution for the autonomous charging problem for quadrotors requires a system that is efficient to reduce power waste and heat generation, portable, so that it may be transported and used in different tasks, universal, so that it is able to charge quadrotors of different frame shapes, sizes, and battery capacities, and robust, such that it guarantees persistent docking performance by accommodating large control and localization errors of the quadrotor.",
                        "Various solutions have been proposed for extending the flight time of quadrotors. One such solution is battery expansion and battery replacement (see De Silva, et al., Drones, 2022; Williams, et al., International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics, 2018; Liu, et al., IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 2017; Ure, et al., IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 2015; Lee, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), 2015; and Michini, et al., Proceedings of the Infotech Aerospace, 2011). Others include wireless charging (see Jawad, et al., Energies, 2022; Junaid, et al., Aerospace Science and Technology, 2016; Choi, et al., International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, 2016; and Chae, et al., 2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM), 2015); contact charging (see Jain, et al., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020; Cocchioni, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 2014; Mulgaonkar, et al., 2014; and Song, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 2014); and tethered charging (see Gu, et al., Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 2016; Kiribayashi, et al., IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics, 2015; and Wang, et al., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2021).",
                        "However, these approaches do not meet all the requirements of the ideal autonomous charging system for quadrotors, but trade-off efficiency, portability, universality, and robustness. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a universal, efficient, autonomous charging solution for UAVs."

One embodiment of the disclosed system, shown in FIG. 2, comprises a compact ground station 202, and a flexible charging tether 203, to connect the ground station 202 to the UAV 201.",
                        "The charging is performed through a pair of connectors 204, which may in some embodiments be circular magnetic connectors that establish a precise, orientation-agnostic connection between the tether 203 and the station 202. By leveraging direct contact charging, the disclosed system ensures a low impedance electrical connection, and thus high electrical efficiency, while charging.",
                        "The ground station may in some embodiments comprise a magnet, which may in some embodiments be a switchable magnet, for example an electromagnet (EM), to strengthen the magnetic field generated by one or more magnets positioned within or on the connectors. Where an EM is used, the EM may be configured such that it is only active during docking and disabled during charging and un-docking. Such a configuration increases the probability of a correct contact when approaching the ground station, but also an easy and smooth detachment when the charging operation is completed.",
                        "Consequently, by leveraging the circular magnetic connectors and the EM, the disclosed system is robust to control and localization errors (see Saviolo, et al., IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2022; Saviolo, et al., arXiv, 2022). The charging tether may be configured as an add-on to an existing onboard battery, thus requiring minimal modifications for the UAV, and enabling the disclosed system to charge quadrotors of different frame shapes and sizes.",

                        "The disclosed system does not require any reserved area for the quadrotor's body to dock on, as illustrated in FIG. 3A\u2014FIG. 3I. As a consequence, the ground station's dimensions are agnostic to the UAV's size and the station can be much smaller than the UAV, making the disclosed system highly portable. As discussed further below, the present disclosure provides a simple and precise description of the manufacturing process used to develop the disclosed ground station and charging tether. Some components are simple to manufacture from a low-cost (\u02dc$300) 3D printer or milling machine, while others can be directly purchased off the shelf. Existing commercial solutions are remarkably expensive, reaching prices up to $30,000, while the disclosed system can be produced for less than $50."

                                "Battery expansion represents the simplest option available to increase a UAV's mission time. However, increasing the battery size does not linearly increment the flight time, as demonstrated Bauersfeld, et al., IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2022. One of the core reasons is that expanding the battery capacity and size also inevitably increases the weight. Consequently, the motors need to provide more power for lifting and controlling the UAV, resulting in more energy being consumed.",
                                "Battery replacement represents an efficient solution because it provides the shortest recovery time for a UAV to return to flight and can be fully automated through external robotic systems. However, battery replacement solutions generally include highly-engineered bulky systems that are specifically designed for particular robot structures (see e.g. De Silva, et al., Drones, 2022; Williams, et al., International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics, 2018; and Ure, et al., IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, 2015). Moreover, these systems require periodical calibration or feedback control to ensure they remain in phase, hence they are especially prone to jamming.",
                                "For example, Michini, et al., Proceedings of the Infotech Aerospace, 2011 proposes a dual-drum structure that holds several batteries and automatically swaps the onboard battery with a charged one. Despite being an efficient solution for extending the flight time of quadrotors, the entire system structure is bulky and composed of a tremendous number of components, from microcontrollers and control motors to locking arms and rotational encoders. Therefore, the system is not portable and each of these several components introduce failure points that may damage the UAV and critically interrupt the performed mission.",
                                "Lee, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS), 2015 attempts to simplify the system structure by using fundamental design principles but still does not resolve the problem of failure points during the battery replacement operation. Contrarily, the disclosed system is compact, lightweight, and configured to autonomously charge quadrotors that differ in size and battery capacity. Another major issue for battery replacement strategies is the need to precisely land on the docking station (see Liu, et al., IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics, 2017). While additional mechanical components can be designed to minimize this problem, this would introduce more complexity and failure points. In contrast, the disclosed system fully leverages electromagnetic induction to enable precise docking and un-docking, resulting in minimal moving components and thus guaranteeing high robustness to mechanical failures.",
                                "Finally, battery replacement methods require power cycling the UAV, which may have undesirable consequences for performance. The software stack may need to completely reset, and this may cause localization and control degradation once the robot is powered back on. Advantageously over battery replacement, autonomous charging allows the UAV to continuously sense the environment which may in some embodiments be key for mission success. In conclusion, battery replacement solutions are not universal, robust, or portable.",
                                "Wireless charging provides a straightforward charging operation that typically only requires the inclusion of a receiver coil on the UAV frame and supplying a corresponding wireless charging station with a transmitter coil. When the coils are close to one another, the onboard battery begins to charge. For example, Junaid, et al., Aerospace Science and Technology, 2016 presents a charging station using wireless inductive charging, the same technology used for charging smartphones and other electronic devices. However, the power transfer efficiency of wireless charging is only about 75% when the receiver and transmitter coils are precisely aligned and it significantly degrades as alignment decreases. Achieving precise alignment also requires a very precise landing or a very large receiver coil on the vehicle.",
                                "Several works have sought to address the issues of alignment and poor power transfer efficiency, for example, Chae, et al., 2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM), 2015.",
                                "In another example, the authors in Choi, et al., International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences, 2016 designed a wireless charging station that uses ultrasonic sensors for identifying the UAV's position after landing. Stepper motors were configured to move the transmitter coil under the quadrotor. As with battery replacement systems, this solution employs multiple mechanical components to coordinate and precisely move, resulting in additional failure points. Additionally, despite advances in state estimation and mechanical systems for the alignment of the coils, even when such coils are accurately aligned, wireless charging efficiency remains 25-30% lower compared to tethered charging solutions, including the systems disclosed herein. As a result, wireless charging solutions are neither robust, nor efficient.",
                                "Contact charging provides high-efficiency charging by modifying a component of a UAV, for example the landing gear, to accommodate connectors that establish electrical contact between the vehicle and the charging station after docking (see e.g. Mulgaonkar, et al., 2014). For example, Song, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 2014 proposes new landing gears to host the wires to charge the system as well as a charging station that consists of four metal plates. After landing, the quadrotor is switched off by a weight sensor on the station and the battery gets charged.",
                                "Cocchioni, et al., International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 2014 presents similar landing gears with electrical connections from the battery to their lower ends and a passive centering system made of four upside-down hollow cones for correcting the landing positional error. Jain, et al., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020 shows a mid-air docking and in-flight battery charging approach. A small quadrotor carrying a fully charged battery docks on a bigger quadrotor in mid-air and charges the battery of the latter by using electrical connectors threaded in its landing gear.",
                                "Despite the appealing results, contact charging solutions require modification of specific quadrotor components for connecting the battery to the external power source, and are not easily generalizable to different robot structures. Moreover, these solutions require the quadrotor to land precisely in order to align the electrical connectors, thus creating control challenges, such as stochastic ground effects or disturbances during docking (see Saviolo, et al., arXiv, 2022; Mao, et al., IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2023). Consequently, contact charging solutions are not universal, robust, or portable.",
                                "Tethered charging enables unlimited flight time by directly and physically connecting the quadrotor to a charging station. Hence, this strategy does not need precise physical landing and positioning on a charging station and avoids repeated recharging. Gu, et al., Nuclear Engineering and Technology, 2016, for example, employs tethered charging with a quadrotor for a mission in a nuclear power plant. The major drawback of tethered charging is the flight area that the quadrotor can cover. The charging tether used cannot be too long due to the internal resistance and weight of the cable itself which would reduce power efficiency and maneuverability respectively.",
                                "Several works have been proposed to overcome this limitation by enabling the ground station to move with the quadrotor. For example, Kiribayashi, et al., IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics, 2015 uses an unmanned ground vehicle to carry the ground station that is directly connected to the quadrotor. The vehicle follows the quadrotor and extends the flight area. However, by combining aerial and ground vehicles, the quadrotor's maneuverability becomes limited by the ground conditions below it. As a result, tethered charging solutions are not portable.",
                                "The authors in Wang, et al., IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2021 propose a charging system that uses onboard sensing to attach a tether with a pair of loose hooks mid-flight. However, this method is not orientation-agnostic because the pair of hooks must match the charging station's polarity, requires precise control to localize and grasp the tether, and the loose tether attachment limits the quadrotor's ability to roll and pitch to avoid detachment.",
                                "The disclosed charging system is easy to assemble even by non-experts. For the sake of clarity and to simplify the design, components of the disclosed system were manufactured for charging up to 4-cell Lithium Polymer (LiPo) batteries. However, the same manufacturing process can be extended to LiPo batteries of larger capacities by including more copper rings in the connectors.",
                                "The disclosed device's operating principle is illustrated in FIG. 3A through FIG. 3I. When an onboard battery is running low, the quadrotor 301 approaches the charging station 302 and the natural magnetic force generated by the EM precisely auto-aligns the connector 303 with a mating connector on the charging station 302. Once the electrical connection is established, the EM is deactivated, the charging operation begins, and the quadrotor 301 lands (see FIG. 3E). During charging, the quadrotor's software stack remains active and no power cycling occurs. This guarantees that while refueling the quadrotor can perform multiple secondary mission tasks (see Mao, et al., IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2023; Morando, et al., Drones, 2022; Morando, et al., IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, 2020). When the charging operation is completed, the quadrotor 301 smoothly un-docks from the ground station 302 and continues the mission (see FIG. 3H).",
                                "The ground station 302 (see FIG. 4) is designed to enable efficient charging once the electrical connection with the charging tether is established. The station may be mounted to the ground and is attached to an external power source. Components of the station are an electrical circuit (described in further detail below) an EM 401, a female circular magnetic connector (not shown), and an enclosure 402, which may in some embodiments comprise a polymer, for example poly-lactic acid (PLA). The ground station 302 further includes power conversion circuitry 403, for example comprising a balance charger; a switching device 405, which may for example comprise a relay. The ground station 302 may further comprise a microcontroller 404 or other computing device, for example configured to control the EM 401, the power conversion circuitry 403, and/or the relay 405. In some embodiments, the ground station 302 may comprise one or more indicator devices, for example a speaker for providing audio indications, one or more LEDs or controllable displays for providing visual information about the status of the ground station 302.",
                                "The EM 401 may be configured to selectively generate a powerful magnetic field that attracts the magnetic head of the charging tether when the quadrotor is approaching the station. The magnetic force may then be switched off, for example by the computing device 404, during charging and un-docking. This design ensures a fast, robust docking procedure along with smooth un-docking. The ground station may in some embodiments be designed to be flexible and adapt to different flight operations, leading to trade-offs between portability and robustness.",
                                "For example, if a mission is carried out in an outdoor environment characterized by stochastic wind effects that degrade the control and localization performance, then it may be advantageous to strengthen the magnetic field generated by the EM 401. Contrarily, if the flight mission is performed indoor with relatively accurate state estimation and control algorithms, then portability can be maximized by employing a smaller-scale EM 401. In some embodiments, the strength of the magnetic field generated by the EM 401 may be modulated, for example by computing device 404. In one embodiment, the strength of the magnetic field may be modulated by providing different power output to the EM 401 in different conditions.",
                                "The female circular magnetic connector (see FIG. 5 and FIG. 6A) may be manufactured via any suitable method, including but not limited to using a mm-level precision printed circuit board (PCB) mill. An exemplary schematic diagram of male and female connectors is shown in FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C. One or more holes may be added to the female connector to allow electric connection from the back. The ground station enclosure 402 and fasteners, which are used for aligning and holding the female connector and other electronic components, may be produced via additive manufacturing or any other suitable means. The components may be connected to one another to form the ground station shown in FIG. 4. In some embodiments, the ground station 400 weighs 0.56 kg. and has the dimensions 15\u00d710\u00d76 cm3.",
                                "The charging tether 203 (see FIG. 7) is a custom cable that is connected to the battery 702, which in some embodiments (as seen in FIG. 2) dangles from the aircraft frame during flight operation. The tether may in some embodiments comprise low-resistance 20 gauge multi-core wire that connects a connector 701 to a circular magnetic connector 204. In some embodiments, the connector 701 may be a male or female connector configured to mate with a corresponding connector on battery 702. In some embodiments, the connector 701 may comprise a Japan Solderless Terminal (JST) connector.",
                                "The male circular magnetic connector 204 may comprise a line of contacts, for example pogo pins, which may in some embodiments be magnetic, and which matches the female circular connector 601 on the ground station (see for example FIG. 6A). The male connector 204 may in some embodiments be slightly concave or slightly convex, for example in order to ensures that while docking the electrical connection is established only when the male and female circuits perfectly mate, thus avoiding potential dangerous shorting issues.",
                                "The charging tether's length is arbitrary and should be chosen based on the carried flight task. If during charging the aircraft is passively waiting for the operation to be completed, then the tether's length may be short to minimize the effect on the dynamics of the system and minimize efficiency loss from increased resistance from a longer tether. Contrarily, if the aircraft is required to perform active tasks during charging, such as inspection or surveillance, then the tether's length can be relatively long.",
                                "Additional information on tethered flight and the tradeoffs related to a the tether's length and how the cable's resistance affects the charging efficiency may be found in Kiribayashi, et al., IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics, 2015; Vishnevsky, et al., International Conference on Distributed Computer and Communication Networks, 2019; and Jain, et al., arXiv, 2022, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The charging tether's weight is mainly determined by the weight of the magnetic connector. The magnetic strength of this connector can be fully customized for the considered application. Hence, trading-off portability and robustness is analogous to the EM design choice. This trade-off is explored in more detail in the experimental examples below.",

The battery connector may comprise any suitable connector, and in some embodiments is a JST connector electrically connected to one end of the wires, for example via soldering. The tether is in some embodiments connected at the other end to the male circular magnetic connector that establishes the electrical connection with the ground station, as discussed above. Although the disclosed device comprises a male connector on the tether and a female connector on the ground station, it is understood that in some embodiments the female connector may be positioned on the tether and the male connector may be positioned on the ground station.",

The balance charger 801 is directly connected to the female magnetic circular connector 803 which mates with the battery 804. The depicted system automatically detects and supplies power to one or more battery cells, hence providing a universal, efficient, and balanced charging operation for any suitable battery. Although the disclosed example was implemented with four cells, it is understood that the number of cells can be scaled up arbitrarily.",

A relay 806 is arranged to allow the microcontroller 807 to turn power to the EM on or off. Some embodiments may further comprise a switch 805 allowing for manual control of the EM 805. In some embodiments, in idle conditions, for example while the aircraft is not attached, the relay 806 closes and the current flows allowing the EM 805 to pull the tether into position when it comes within range of the EM's magnetic field.",

The aircraft may in some embodiments be configured to measure its internal battery voltage to estimate its current capacity and take off autonomously once a sufficient amount of charge has been accumulated. After the aircraft takes off, no current flows through the connector 803 or the current sensor 802, and the relay 806 then closes after a short delay allowing another charging iteration to occur.",

                                "Different magnetic connectors were investigated for their effects on the docking success, power consumption, and control degradation of the SD2S aircraft. First, the docking success was evaluated in terms of the maximum distance from which the ground station is able to pull the male magnetic connector into a correct position using the EM. Also, the power consumed and the control degradation resulting from different tether configurations was evaluated during an effort to continuously track a circular trajectory of radius 1 m at 2 m/s until the battery voltage reached 6.6 V. A graph of the results of the docking success experiment is shown in graph 901 of FIG. 9.",
                                "The control degradation was evaluated based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the quadrotor position and reference trajectory at every control iteration, and the power consumption was measured in terms of battery voltage over time. The experiments were repeated 5 times to estimate the mean and standard deviation of both metrics. For each experiment, the aircraft's mass was scaled appropriately for the controller, and the ground station's EM and magnetic attractiveness remained constant. A graph of the results of the control degradation experiment is shown in graph 903 of FIG. 9.",
                                "The additional weight increased the amount of thrust that the motors needed to provide for lifting and controlling the aircraft. Consequently, the flight time for heavier magnetic connectors was inferior to smaller ones, resulting in a flight time degradation of up to 15%. (see graph 902 of FIG. 9). Moreover, the results show that altering the aircraft's system with the lighter charging tether does not significantly affect the tracking performance. Therefore, this demonstrates that the proposed charging solution does not significantly alter the aircraft's system dynamics. Importantly, the results show that employing larger and stronger magnets directly impacts the docking success, by improving the pull distance by a factor of five. This boosted docking performance may be critical for applications where localization and control errors are unavoidable (e.g., outdoor environments affected by stochastic wind gusts), enabling the aircraft to reliably perform precise docking operations. When the male circular magnetic connector is within the bounds of the docking success area, the attachment operation had a 100% success rate in all the performed experiments. The performance was further validated by controlling an aircraft to continuously attach and detach from the ground station over 100 iterations."

Moreover, the results showed no noticeable battery degradation over the entire flight, hence validating the disclosed system for safe and efficient charging for quadrotors. Toward the end of the 10 hour flight, the charger's temperature protection was triggered causing it to throttle the charging current until the ideal operating temperature range was reached.
