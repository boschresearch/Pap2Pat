    "title": "Aerobic biogenesis of selenium nanoparticles by Enterobacter cloacae Z0206 as a consequence of fumarate reductase mediated selenite reduction",
    "date": "2017-06-12",
    "abstract": "In the present study, we examined the ability of Enterobacter cloacae Z0206 to reduce toxic sodium selenite and mechanism of this process. E. cloacae Z0206 was found to completely reduce up to 10 mM selenite to elemental selenium (Se\u00b0) and form selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) under aerobic conditions. The selenite reducing effector of E. cloacae Z0206 cell was to be a membrane-localized enzyme. iTRAQ proteomic analysis revealed that selenite induced a significant increase in the expression of fumarate reductase. Furthermore, the addition of fumarate to the broth and knockout of fumarate reductase (frd) both significantly decreased the selenite reduction rate, which revealed a previously unrecognized role of E. cloacae Z0206 fumarate reductase in selenite reduction. In contrast, glutathione-mediated Painter-type reactions were not the main pathway of selenite reducing. In conclusion, E. cloacae Z0206 effectively reduced selenite to Se\u00b0 using fumarate reductase and formed SeNPs; this capability may be employed to develop a bioreactor for treating Se pollution and for the biosynthesis of SeNPs in the future.",

                "Selenium (Se) is an important element for life and exhibits redox activity in the environment1. The Se cycle (see Figure\u00a0S1, in Supplementary Information) is complex because the element can exist in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from \u2212II to\u2009+\u2009VI2, 3. Se is released into the environment either from the weathering of Se-rich rocks2, 4 (e.g., black shales, carbonaceous, limestones, carbonaceous cherts, mudstones, and seleniferous coal) or from anthropogenic sources from industrial and agricultural activities5. Se can exist in the environment in multiple forms, including ionic selenate or selenite, solid-state Se(0), and selenocysteine/selenoproteins6. The toxicity rank of these forms is selenite\u2009>\u2009selenocysteine\u2009>\u2009selenate\u2009\u2248\u2009selenomethionine\u2009>\u2009elemental Se7\u201310. Apart from natural Se originating from weathering of seleniferous soils and rocks, anthropogenic activities, e.g. mining, metal refining and coal fire-based power production, lead to Se contamination in the environment11. Thus, remediation measures are required to treat Se contamination, because it has become an important public health concern12. At present, physicochemical methods, e.g. nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, ferrihydrite and zero valent iron, are usually used for Se removal from waste water. However, such physicochemical methods are commonly high-cost or inefficient for selenium removal13.",
                "The lifetime of selenite in soils is closely associated with microbial activity11. Certain strains that are resistant to selenite and reduce selenite to the Se\u00b0 or to methylated Se forms14\u201318, may potentially be used for the bioremediation of contaminated soils, sediments, industrial effluents, and agricultural drainage waters. The ABMet\u00ae Technology developed by GE Water & Process Technologies efficiently removes selenate and selenite from waste water via bacteria reduction, and the elemental Se could be separated from the biofilter tank through a backwash process11. It is worth noting that most bacterially assembled Se\u00b0 particles are selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), which are deposited inside a cell (cytoplasmic), within the periplasm or extracellularly12, 19\u201321. These particulate SeNPs display special physical characteristics, such as photoelectric, semiconducting and X-ray sensing properties11, 22. They also possess an adsorptive ability, antioxidant functions, and due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio, marked biological reactivity23\u201326. However, there is now growing concern about the environmental impact of nanoparticle synthesis based on physico-chemical methods that require high pressures and temperatures, are energy consuming, use toxic chemicals, and generate hazardous byproducts27. Consequently, applications using biological systems such as microbial cultures for the production of metal nanoparticles, including SeNPs, are becoming an increasingly realistic alternative27, 28.",
                "Reduction of selenite to Se\u00b0 has been shown to be mediated by thiols (Painter-type reactions) in the cytoplasm as part of a microbial detoxification strategy29. Selenite reacts with GSH and forms selenodiglutathione (GS-Se-SG), which is further reduced to glutathione selenopersulfide (GS-Se\u2212) by NADPH-glutathione reductase. GS-Se\u2212 is an unstable intermediate and undergoes a hydrolysis reaction to form Se\u00b0 and reduced GSH. In addition to Painter-type reactions, a number of terminal reductases for anaerobic respiration, two nitrite reductases, an inducible sulfite reductase and a fumarate reductase, have also been reported to be able to carry out selenite reduction in cells30\u201333.",
                "Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1, a selenate-respiring facultative anaerobe, has been demonstrated to catalyze the reduction of both selenate and selenite to Se\u00b012, 34, 35, but the selenite or selenate concentrations adopted in these studies were extremely low (less than 1.5\u2009mM). The reduction of selenate was shown to be mediated by a membrane-bound molybdoenzyme36, 37, but the mechanism of selenite reduction in this strain has not been elucidated. Moreover, all of the selenite-reducing assays involving E. cloacae in these studies were performed in an anaerobic environment, and the selenite-reducing ability of E. cloacae has not previously been investigated under aerobic conditions. E. cloacae Z0206, a strain that we isolated from Reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) \u201cmeat\u201d38, was found to possess excellent selenite resistance, tolerating more than 100\u2009mM selenite. In the present investigation, we studied (i) the selenite-reducing ability of E. cloacae Z0206 under aerobic conditions, (ii) the characteristics and location of the produced SeNPs, and (iii) the mechanism of selenite reduction in the Z0206 strain."

                        "To determine the toxicity of selenite to the microorganism, the growth profile of E. cloacae Z0206 was studied under various concentrations of selenite (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15\u2009mM). According to the apparent changes in the spent broth shown in Fig.\u00a01A, we found that the strain formed a reddish cell suspension, which indicated its ability to reduce the toxic, colorless, soluble selenite ions to the non-toxic, red, insoluble elemental form of Se (Se\u00b0). It is worth noting that the red color of the broth darkened, and viscosity increased with the increase of the selenite concentration. The results regarding the growth profile (Fig.\u00a01B) showed that the addition of selenite strikingly inhibited the growth rate of E. cloacae Z0206, and the inhibitory effect strengthened with the increase of the selenite concentration during the log phase. However, the final cell density in the presence of selenite (0.5\u2009mM\u201315\u2009mM) was comparable to that of the control without selenite addition, as verified by the result of a bacteria counting assay performed at 96\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01C). Evaluation of the selenite-reducing ability of the bacterium (Fig.\u00a01D) showed that selenite was rapidly reduced by this strain, with 10\u2009mM selenite being completely reduced in 144\u2009h. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the rates of selenite reduction were modeled using the Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation (see section 1.1, in Supplementary Information). A nonlinear least-square analysis of the data yield a K m value of 4.37\u2009mM and a V max of 59.32\u2009\u03bcmol/h/g. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the morphology of the bacterium and reduced selenite (Fig.\u00a01F) revealed that as the selenite concentration increased, the rod-shaped cells tended to become shorter. Selenite at concentrations greater than or equal to 1\u2009mM significantly stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances. SeNPs ranging from 100\u2013300\u2009nm were observed scattered around the cells and occurred as aggregates attached to the bacterial biomass in the presence of selenite, and the particle density grew with the increase of the selenite concentration. These results indicated that selenite merely reduced the growth rate of E. cloacae Z0206 rather than decreasing the final amount of bacteria. Additionally, the bacterium detoxified selenite by rapidly reducing it to Se\u00b0 and formed SeNPs, highlighting the species as a promising exploitable option for setting up of low-cost biological treatment units for the bioremediation of Se-laden effluents.Figure 1Growth and selenite reduction of E. cloacae Z0206 in the presence of various concentrations of selenite.

                        "Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDX) flat scanning of the area in Fig.\u00a02A revealed a strong Se atom signal, accounting for 2.69% of the total component elements (Fig.\u00a02B). EDX elemental mapping was used to detect the Se distribution. Four elemental maps of Se, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen were obtained and are shown in different colors based on the scanning area encompassing both the contents of E. cloacae Z0206 and the surrounding area (Fig.\u00a02C). The map of elemental oxygen and nitrogen showed the cell shape and distribution of biomass. In contrast, element carbon was distributed both within and outside of cells because the cells were embedded by carbon-containing Epon plastic. However, the Se strong signals, shown in green, perfectly matched the profile of the extracellular nanoparticles, verifying that these particles were SeNPs. Moreover, Se, oxygen and nitrogen overlapped in the SeNPs distribution area, implying that these SeNPs may be coated with biomass. In addition, there was a weak Se signal inside the bacteria, suggesting that SeNPs may also exist inside the cells. However, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed the presence of electron-dense nanoparticles both within and outside of the cells (Fig.\u00a02D), which was not found in cell cultures without selenite (see Figure\u00a0S2, in Supplementary Information). The EDX spectra of these nanospheres clearly indicated the presence of Se, as specific absorption peaks at 1.37 and 11.22\u2009keV were recorded (Fig.\u00a02E). The lack of peaks corresponding to other metals indicated that Se occurred in its elemental state (Se\u00b0) rather than as a metal selenide. This was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, which shows clearly the 3D spectral peak of Se\u00b0 (Fig.\u00a02F). These results suggested that E. cloacae Z0206 reduces Se(IV) to Se(0) and assembles it into nanoparticles.Figure 2Characterization and localization of E. cloacae Z0206 synthesized SeNPs.

                        "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the reduction of selenite to Se\u00b0 in microorganisms, including (i) Painter-type reactions29, (ii) the thioredoxin reductase system39, (iii) siderophore-mediated reduction40, (iv) sulfide-mediated reduction6 and (v) dissimilatory reduction30\u201332. Among these potential mechanisms, i, ii and v occur inside the cell, while the other reactions occur extracellularly. To help determine how selenite was reduced by E. cloacae Z0206, subcellular fractions, including cytoplasm, membrane proteins and the supernatant from liquid cultures, were isolated after 12\u2009h of growth without selenite, and the selenite-reducing ability of each fraction was evaluated. As shown in Fig.\u00a03, selenite was reduced to orange-colored Se by only the membrane-associated proteins after the addition of NADH, whereas little orange-colored Se occurred without NADH. However, boiling the membrane fraction samples resulted in a complete loss of reduction activity (data not shown). These results indicated that the reduction process mediated by membrane-associated proteins was an enzymatic reaction and was NADH dependent. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic fraction and supernatant failed to change the color to orange, suggesting that these two fractions possess no selenite-reducing ability.Figure 3Selenite-reducing ability of different fractions of E. cloacae Z0206. The selenite-reducing ability of the bacterium was estimated using the following reaction mixture: 100\u2009\u00b5g protein, 10\u2009mM selenite and 10\u2009mM NADH in 200\u2009\u00b5l Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 8\u2009h. The reaction mixture with the total cell fraction and without selenite served as positive and negative controls, respectively."

Although E. cloacae Z0206 is a \u03b3 proteobacterium, the above results indicated that it may reduce selenite through a membrane-bound enzyme rather than through a thiol-related reaction. To identify the probable mechanism involved, we undertook a large-scale proteomic analysis (iTRAQ) to examine the modification of protein expression in response to selenite (complete data on protein quantification are shown in Table\u00a0S1, in Supplementary Information). The analysis focused on the proteins whose expression varied by more than a factor of 1.2. According to this criterion, 172 proteins were induced after selenite treatment, and 212 proteins were significantly repressed. All of the significantly differentially regulated proteins identified were subjected to gene ontology analysis. Among the 287 proteins involved in biological processes, 274 proteins and 175 proteins were dedicated to metabolic processes and cellular processes, respectively. For each of the three ontologies, the annotated data revealed that the proteins were mainly distributed among two or three of the general term categories. In the biological process category, the three most abundant categories included proteins that are involved in metabolic processes (244), cellular processes (230), and single-organism processes (198). In the molecular process category, the two main categories involved in catalytic activity (207) and binding (172). In the cellular component category, the three largest categories were cell (153), macromolecular complex (63), and membrane (61) (see Figure\u00a0S3, in Supplementary Information).",

Li, et al.33 demonstrated that the reduction of selenite in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is mediated by fumarate reductase, indicating that fumarate reductase may play a role in the selenite-reducing process in E. cloacae Z0206. However, the most expected antioxidant proteins, such as glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-disulfide reductase, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase, showed no significant change in response to selenite treatment (see Table\u00a0S2, Support Information).Table 1Identification of proteins induced by selenite (>2.0-fold).DescriptionFoldSignificanceTagatose-bisphosphate aldolase3.787.20E-50Cytochrome D ubiquinol oxidase subunit I2.927.16E-33DNA polymerase V subunit UmuC2.869.93E-32Damage-inducible protein I2.811.16E-30DNA repair protein RecN2.801.53E-30Virulence protein MsgA (Fragment)2.684.44E-28Damage-inducible protein YebG2.542.93E-25Integrase2.533.23E-2560\u2009kDa heat shock protein (Fragment)2.517.83E-25Fumarate reductase subunit C2.426.52E-23Na\u2009+\u2009dependent nucleoside transporter domain protein2.351.41E-21Small heat shock protein IbpA2.191.86E-18Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase2.092.02E-16"

As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, BSO doses of 1.5\u2009mM, 3.0\u2009mM and 5.0\u2009mM slightly decreased the growth rate during the exponential phase. In the stationary phase, the cell densities of all BSO-treated groups were slightly lower than that of the control group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Therefore, doses of 1.5\u2009mM and 3.0\u2009mM were chosen to study the effect of GSH on selenite reduction.

First, the impact of fumarate on the growth of this strain was studied. As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, different concentrations of fumarate did not affect the growth rate during the exponential phase, whereas a dose of 50\u2009mM led to an evident increase in cell density during the stationary phase. Thus, a dose of 20\u2009mM fumarate was selected to ensure that the cell density was similar to that of control cells without fumarate treatment. Based on the results shown in Fig.\u00a06B, a dose of 20\u2009mM fumarate significantly decreased the reduction rate. After 72\u2009h, 41% and 72% remaining selenite was detected in the cultures without and with fumarate, respectively. These results indicated that competition existed between selenite and fumarate for fumarate reductase33, and fumarate reductase may present the main pathway of selenite reduction in E. cloacae Z0206.Figure 6Effect of fumarate reductase on selenite reduction in E. cloacae Z0206.

                        "We constructed the fumarate reductase-mutated strain \u0394frd to confirm that enzyme\u2019s role in selenite reduction in E. cloacae Z0206. As shown in Fig.\u00a06C, mutation of fumarate reductase did not significantly influence the growth of the cell. However, the mutant strain \u0394frd exhibited a markedly repressed selenite-reducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain. After 72\u2009h of reduction, 68.25% of the original selenite remained in cultures of the \u0394frd strain, while only 42.58% of selenite could be detected in cultures of the wild-type strain (Fig.\u00a06D). Therefore, E. cloacae Z0206 reduces selenite mainly through fumarate reductase.",
                        "In conclusion, many bacterial strains have been demonstrated to reduce selenite to Se0 and form SeNPs under anaerobic conditions, whereas bacteria grown in aerobic conditions possess the ability to rapidly generate more bacterial cells within a short time period and under less stringent culture conditions. In the present study, E. cloacae Z0206 was found to effectively reduce selenite to Se0 under aerobic conditions, and form monodispersed nanosized (approximately 100\u2013300\u2009nm in diameter) particles, which were observed both within and outside of the cells. Moreover, the selenite-reducing factor of E. cloacae Z0206 was demonstrated to be a membrane-localized fumarate reductase rather than a GSH-mediated Painter-type reaction. Biosynthesis of SeNPs under aerobic conditions presents advantages over the chemical process, in which SeNPs are produced under environmentally harmful conditions. Thus, E. cloacae Z0206 may be used to develop a bioreactor for the treatment of Se pollution and biosynthesis of SeNPs. Further studies may focus on the properties of biogenic SeNPs, compared with chemically synthesized SeNPs and the potential applications in the fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology."
