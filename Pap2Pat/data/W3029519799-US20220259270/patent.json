                        "Cellulases or hemicellulases are enzymes that constitute a complex capable of acting on cellulosic materials, promoting their hydrolysis. Such enzymes are highly specific biocatalysts that act in the release of sugars, of which glucose is the one that raises the greatest industrial interest, due to the possibility of its conversion into ethanol. The efficient production of cellulases is important for the definition of a biorefinery, which uses renewable lignocellulosic materials to produce fuel and chemicals with high added value.",
                        "Due to its industrial importance, in the recent decades several studies have been published about the factors that affect the production of these enzymes and their ideal culture medium. That is because in the context of ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials, cellulases are inputs that impact the process and can represent a significant operating cost for a plant.",
                        "In order to increase the levels of enzyme production, different techniques can be used, among which the most common concerning cellulases are the selection of fungi, either by classical (random) mutation or by gene expression. The classic mutation has been applied for decades to fungal strains such as Trichoderma.",
                        "In this sense, Trichoderma reesei (Martinez D. et al. (2008) Genome sequencing and analysis of the biomass-degrading fungus Trichoderma reesei. Nat Biotechnol. 26, 553-560), a mesophilic and filamentous fungus, anamorph from the fungus Hypocrea jecorina, has been being generated several strains with particular properties, among which the most reported is the Rut C30 strain (Koike H. et al. (2013) Comparative genomics analysis of Trichoderma reesei strains. Ind. Biotech. 9(6):352-367). This strain had its cellulolytic potential increased due to the mutation of the cre1 gene (causing lesser effect of catabolic repression of glucose by the cells, during the expression of enzymes) and to the increase in the amount of endoplasmic reticulum (promoting an increase in the rates of O-glycosylation of proteins).",
                        "It has been shown that the Trichoderma is useful as a host cell for the recombinant production of polypeptides having biological activity. Several publications teach genetic modifications with the disruption or overexpression of one or more specific genes, seeking to improve their activity (international publications WO9823642, WO17177289, WO11075677, WO10022518, among others).",
                        "However, the performance in the activity of the enzyme cocktail produced by such fungi remains a challenge, so that new strains incorporating the selection of gene modifications for improved production of enzyme cocktails are highly desired."

                        "New Trichoderma strains can be engineered by gene deletion techniques to eliminate or reduce gene expression. Gene deletion techniques allow for partial or complete removal of the gene thereby eliminating its expression. In such methods, gene deletion is performed by homologous recombination by using a plasmid that has been engineered to contiguously contain the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions flanking the gene.",
                        "These new Trichoderma mutants can also be engineered by introduction, substitution, overexpression, and/or removal of one or more (several) nucleotides in the gene or a control sequence required for its transcription or translation. For example, nucleotides can be inserted or removed for the introduction of a stop codon, the removal of the initiation codon, or a displacement from the open reading matrix.",
                        "Gene disruption techniques are also available. New Trichoderma strains can also be engineered by inserting into the gene a disruptive nucleic acid construct comprising a nucleic acid fragment homologous to the gene which will produce a duplication of the homology region and incorporate DNA construct between the duplicated regions.",
                        "All these modifications can be performed by classical mutagenesis techniques (Botstein and Shortle, Strategies and applications of in vitro mutagenesis. Science. 1985 Sep. 20; 229(4719):1193-201., among others).",
                        "Aiming to provide strains that show improved performance in the production of enzyme cocktails, a new strains of Trichoderma was developed that comprises specific genetic modifications: overexpression of transcription factor Xyr1, as defined in SEQ ID No. 1; disruption of the ACE1 gene according to SEQ ID No. 2; disruption of the SLP1 gene according to SEQ ID No. 3; and expression of the Cel3a gene from Rasamsonia emersoni as per SEQ ID No. 4.",
                        "The Trichoderma strain according to the present invention may be any Trichoderma strain, such as a wild-type Trichoderma strain or a mutant thereof.",
                        "The new strain according to the present invention can be produced, without any limitation, by classical mutagenesis techniques, well known by the person skilled in the art.",
                        "In particular embodiment, the strain is Trichoderma reesei modified to include at least the four specific gene modifications according to the present invention.",
                        "In an even more particular embodiment, the strain is Trichoderma reesei RutC30 (Koike H. et al. 2013. Comparative genomics analysis of Trichoderma reesei strains. Ind. Biotech. 9(6):352-367). This strain has its cellulolytic potential increased due to the mutation of the cre1 gene (causing lesser effect of the catabolite repression of glucose by the cells, during the expression of enzymes) and to the increase in the amount of endoplasmic reticulum (promoting an increase in the rates of O-glycosylation of proteins).",
                        "Trichoderma reesei Xyr1 transcription factor is required for the expression and secretion of lignocellulolytic enzymes (cellulases and hemicellulases), more specifically of xylanases, and the constitutive expression of this gene increases the enzymatic activity of the cocktail secreted by the fungus. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the xyr1 gene was placed under expression control of the pdc1 gene in the RUT-C30 strain.",
                        "The ace1 gene has been identified as a transcription factor that represses the production of (hemi)cellulases in Trichoderma reesei. Deletion of this gene increases enzymatic production.",
                        "On the other hand, the absence of proteases is a determining factor for the stability of enzyme preparations. For this reason, the removal of proteases coding genes from genomes of (hemi)cellulase-producing fungi has been studied. The slp1 gene from Trichoderma reesei is a protease coding and presents gains in the global production of enzymes. The individual effect of the slp1 gene deletion on fungal productivity has not been reported in the state of the art.",
                        "In turn, the expression of the cel3a gene (beta-glucosidase) from Rasamsonia emersonii represents a significant impact on the activity of the beta-glucosidase enzyme, which is essential for the efficient degradation of lignocellulosic materials. The low beta-glucosidase activity in the enzyme cocktail secreted by Trichoderma reesei has been frequently reported in the prior art and remains a technical challenge to be overcome.",
                        "Surprisingly, the present invention provides a new strain of Trichoderma, in which the selection of specific gene modifications, allows to considerably improve the beta-glucosidase activity.",
                        "In another embodiment, the present invention additionally contemplates one or more of the following gene modifications: disruption of the PEP1 gene as per SEQ ID No. 5; expression of the SucA gene from Aspergillus niger according to SEQ ID No. 6.",
                        "The disruption of the PEP1 gene, which encodes an aspartic protease and its inactivation, is related to an increase in the secretion of lignocellulolytic enzymes and heterologous enzymes in Trichoderma reesei.",
                        "Regarding the expression of the SucA gene of Aspergillus niger, this gene encodes an invertase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into fructose plus glucose, allowing the use of sugarcane molasses as a carbon source for the production of enzymes.",
                        "Within the scope of the present invention, the term \u201cmodified\u201d means introduction, substitution, or removal of one or more (several) nucleotides in a gene or a control sequence required for its transcription or translation, or gene disruption, gene deletion, gene overexpression in a selected Trichoderma strain, by any techniques known to the skilled person.",
                        "Trichoderma strains according to the present invention can be cultivated in a nutrient medium for the production of the polypeptide of interest by using methods known in the art. For example, in a particular embodiment, without any limitation, the culture medium may consist of yeast, e.g. not autolyzed whole yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), at least one carbon source such as sugarcane molasses and ammonium sulfate.",
