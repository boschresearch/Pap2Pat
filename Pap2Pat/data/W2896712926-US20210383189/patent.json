                        "The direct application of classical machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, is challenging to implement for intrinsically quantum problems, which can take quantum states or processes as inputs, or can take advantage of quantum mechanical interactions to produce a solution. In some examples, the extremely large many-body Hilbert space hinders the efficient translation of such problems into a classical framework without performing exponentially difficult quantum state or process tomography.",
                        "Aspects of the present disclosure relate to a machine learning-inspired quantum circuit model, such as a quantum convolutional neural network (\u201cQCNN\u201d) circuit model. A QCNN circuit can be trained on sets of training data, such as qudits in a particular state, and then applied to new data, such as qudits in a different state. In some embodiments, QCNN can involve receiving an input of qudits and performing multiple layers of processing across the qudits. For example, each layer can involve convolving subsets of the qudits and pooling the qudits to reduce the number of qudits considered, and the final layer can be fully connected. After the final layer, the final state of the remaining qudits can be measured. In some embodiments, convolving subsets of the qudits, pooling the qudits, and the fully connected layer can involve application of quantum channels with tunable parameters. The parameters used in these quantum channels can be tuned based on a training set of qudits. A quantum channel can refer to a generic quantum operation, which can be a reversible or irreversible quantum operation, in contrast to quantum gates and unitaries which must be reversible. The inputs and outputs of quantum channels can be classical or quantum mixtures of quantum states. After training, QCNN can be applied with these tuned parameters on a new set of qudits to find a solution based on the trained QCNN circuit.",
                        "In some embodiments, QCNN can solve intrinsically quantum many-body problems. One exemplary problem solvable using embodiments of the disclosed QCNN technique is quantum phase recognition (\u201cQPR\u201d). QPR problems ask whether a given input quantum state \u03c1in belongs to a particular quantum phase of matter. In contrast to many existing solution techniques, such as those based on tensor network descriptions, the QCNN technique is applicable to QPR problems even where \u03c1in is prepared in a physical system without direct knowledge as to its classical description. Another exemplary problem solvable using embodiments of the disclosed QCNN technique is quantum error correction (\u201cQEC\u201d) optimization. Such problems seek to identify an optimal QEC code for a given, a priori unknown error model such as, but not limited to dephasing or potentially correlated depolarization in realistic physical systems. Aspects of the present disclosure describe non-limiting theoretical frameworks and numerical demonstrations for the successful application of QCNN techniques to exemplary non-limiting problems.",
                        "Classical convolutional neural network (\u201cCNN\u201d) provides a machine learning architecture for classification tasks such as image recognition. A CNN can consist of a sequence of different (interleaved) layers of image processing; in each layer, an intermediate two-dimensional array of pixels, which can be referred to as a feature map, is produced from the previous one. As discussed above, CNN layers connect \u2018volumes\u2019 of multiple feature maps to subsequent volumes. Without being bound by theory, the case of a single feature map per volume is discussed below. The convolution layers compute new pixel values from a linear combination of nearby ones in the preceding map, where the new pixel values can be expressed as:",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{{x_{i,j}^{(\\ell)} = {\\sum\\limits_{a,{b = 1}}^{w}\\;{w_{a,b}x_{{i + a},{j + b}}^{({\\ell - 1})}}}},} & {{Equation}\\mspace{14mu} 1}\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "where  is the layer, and j denote the position of the pixel, the weights wa,b form a w\u00d7w matrix, and a, b denote indices into the weight matrix. Pooling layers reduce the feature map size, for example by taking the maximum value from a few contiguous pixels, and can be followed by the application of a nonlinear (activation) function, which can capture and amplify nonlinear correlations of the input. Activation functions introduce nonlinearity into classical and quantum neural networks, and the nonlinearity can increase the performance of the neural networks. Once the feature map size becomes sufficiently small, the final output is computed from a function that depends on all remaining pixels, which can be referred to as the fully connected layer. The weights and fully connected function can be optimized by training on large datasets, where the characteristic to be distinguished is known. In contrast, variables such as the number of convolution and pooling layers and the size w of the weight matrices (which can be referred to as hyperparameters) can be fixed for a specific CNN. In some embodiments, multiple combinations of hyperparameters are tested to determine which set of hyperparameters is most effective and/or efficient. However, a person of skill in the art would understand based on the present disclosure that such testing would add additional training time to determine the set of effective hyperparameters. One key property of a CNN can be the translational invariance of convolution and pooling layers, which allows each of these layers to be characterized by a constant number of parameters (which can be independent of system size) and sequential data size reduction (e.g., a hierarchical structure).",
                        "FIG. 1A is a simplified diagram of a classical CNN technique. As shown in FIG. 1A, the classical CNN begins with an input image 110, which in this case is a cat. A sequence of image-processing layers 120 and 130, and 122 and 132 transforms an input image into a series of feature maps (white rectangles) and finally into an output probability distribution 150.",
                        "More specifically, a convolution layer can involve at least one convolution step 120 on the input image followed by a pooling step 130. Convolution 120 takes subsets of pixels in the input image 110 for the first convolution step, or in the previous feature map for subsequent convolution steps, and combines them using a mathematical operation. The convolution step 120 can be performed on multiple subsets of pixels such that the entire image (or feature map) is covered. Multiple convolutions across the entire image (or feature map) can be performed in the convolution step 120. Each of these convolutions can vary based on what basic function is applied, what pixels are convolved, what parameters are used during convolving, and the like. After the one or more convolution steps 120, the pixels are pooled in step 130 using a pooling function. A pooling function can take as an input the state of two or more pixels and output a smaller number of pixels with a state or characteristic that is dependent on the input pixels. In this way, the size of the image or feature map can be reduced by any fraction. These convolving and pooling steps can be repeated in other layers (e.g., convolution(s) 122 and pooling(s) 132) to obtain a final feature map 140. Subsequently, a fully connected layer, such as a function that combines the state of all remaining pixels, can be performed on the final feature map 140 in order to obtain an output probability distribution 150. The output probability distribution 150 can be indicative of some property of the input image 110, such as whether the input image 110 contains a cat or a dog, with high probability.",
                        "By convolving and pooling the pixels in the input image 110, it is possible to reorganize and reduce the information contained in the input image 110 in a way that ultimately produces an output that classifies the input image 110 (e.g., determines some characteristic about the input image 110). As discussed above, the parameters used throughout the CNN can be trained to better distinguish this characteristic of the image. Each convolution step 120 and 122, and each pooling step 130 and 132 can be varied, for example by tuning the weights wa,b in equation (1). In some examples, training a CNN involves determining parameters for each convolution step and pooling step such that application of the CNN produces a reliable output probability distribution 150. For example, multiple input images with cats and dogs can be used as training data, and the parameters of the CNN can be varied and applied to these images to identify a parameter set that is able to distinguish between images with cats and images with dogs.",
                        "FIG. 1B is a diagram showing an example QCNN circuit, according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the circuit's input is a classical or quantum state pin 111, which can include a plurality of qudits. While most examples and descriptions considered herein will use qubits, a person of skill in the art would understand from the present disclosure that the technique in general applies to qudits with Hilbert space of arbitrary fixed dimension d. During training, the output classification or probability distribution corresponding to the input quantum state \u03c1in 111 may be known so as to tune the QCNN parameters. When applying a trained QCNN, the output probability distribution of the quantum state \u03c1in 111 may be unknown. Like the CNN, the QCNN proceeds with one or more convolving layers 121, 123, 125, 127, which may also be referred to as convolution layers, interleaved with one or more pooling layers 131, 135. The circuit concludes with a fully connected layer 142 followed by measurement of the resulting quantum state 162. Although the example QCNN circuit shown in FIG. 1B includes two convolution layers 121, 123 and 125, 127 between each pooling layer 131, 135, and only two sets of convolution and pooling layers 121, 123, 131 and 125, 127, 135 (e.g., a QCNN depth of two), a person of skill in the art would understand from the present disclosure that these numbers are merely examples, and the numbers of convolution and pooling layers can be varied depending on each implementation. Depending on the particular choice of hardware on which to implement the QCNN technique and the problem to be solved, the gate depth of each layer may vary, where, in this context, the gate depth can refer to the maximal number of gates applied to any fixed, given qubit. In some embodiments, simpler problems with fewer numbers of input qubits may implement fewer numbers of convolution and pooling layers and smaller gate depths within each layer, while more complicated problems may involve larger numbers of layers with larger gate depths within each layer.",
                        "In light of the freedom in choosing the gate depth within each layer and the number of layers in a QCNN circuit, various restrictions can be imposed on a QCNN circuit to increase efficiency and performance, according to some embodiments. For example, when the QCNN technique is applied to solving a problem instance in a class of problems whose inputs comprise a larger and larger number N of qubits, but whose statements are otherwise the same, the total number of convolution and pooling layers applied should not grow asymptotically faster than the logarithm of N multiplied by a constant independent of N. In this context, a constant can be considered independent of the number N of input qubits if the constant does not increase when Nis increased. Furthermore, the maximal gate depth within any layer should not increase beyond a fixed constant independent of N. Moreover, when convolving subgroups and pooling subgroups are chosen within each convolving or pooling layer, respectively, the maximal size of any such subgroup in the entire QCNN circuit should not be larger than a fixed constant independent of N. In addition, if two qubits x, y within a plurality P of qubits are required to be proximal to one another, the ratio of the distance between the two qubits x and y to the minimum distance between any two qubits in P (which have not yet been measured or disregarded in a preceding pooling layer, as described below) should not be larger than a constant independent of N. If all qubits acted on by a single unitary operation U are proximal to one another, the operation U may be called quasilocal.",
                        "One example subclass of QCNN convolving or pooling layers comprises convolving or pooling layers for which the input qubits to the layers are arranged to cover the points of a (finite) lattice. In this context, a lattice can refer to a set of points such that for some lattice direction \u03b4 and lattice distance \u0394, for any point x in the lattice (except possibly a small number of points which are said to belong to the boundary of the lattice), there is another pointy in the lattice located a distance \u0394 away from x in the direction \u03b4. Furthermore, as the number of points Min the lattice is increased, the ratio of the number of points in the boundary of the lattice to M should approach zero. When the input qubits to a QCNN layer are arranged to cover the points of a lattice \u03bb, the QCNN layer can be said to be translationally invariant if for some lattice direction \u03b4 and lattice distance \u0394 of \u03bb, for any input qubit x (except possibly a small number of input qubits in the boundary of the lattice), the operations applied to x are precisely the same as the operations applied to the qubit located at a distance \u0394 away from x in the direction \u03b4. Furthermore, as the number of qubits Min the lattice is increased, the ratio of the distance \u0394 to the minimum distance between any two points in the lattice should be a constant independent of M.",
                        "In some embodiments, each convolution layer 121, 123, 125, 127 applies a single quasilocal unitary (Ui) in a translationally invariant manner for finite depth independent of the number N of input qudits to convolving subgroups of the qubits. For example, as shown in FIG. 1B, each quasilocal unitary Ui is applied to subsets of two qubits. In a non-limiting example physical implementation with qubits implemented as neutral atoms coupled to Rydberg states, a quasilocal unitary could comprise of, for example, a sequence of laser pulses which entangles two nearby atoms.",
                        "In some embodiments, pooling layers 131, 135 measure a fraction of qubits. In some embodiments, the pooling layers 131, 135 are translationally invariant as discussed above. A pooling layer can comprise dividing the qubits into pooling subgroups. The size of each pooling subgroup should be independent of the total number of input qubits, and the qubits in each pooling subgroup should be in proximity to each other. Within each pooling subgroup, a subset of qubits can be measured. The outcome of these measurements can be used to determine the unitary rotations (Vj) applied to nearby qubits. Thus, without being bound by theory, nonlinearities in QCNNs can arise from reducing the number of degrees of freedom (e.g., the number of qubits in each subsequent layer). Convolution and pooling layers can be interleaved (repeated) until the system size is sufficiently small (e.g., when there are a small enough number of qubits). These repeated convolution and pooling layers can be applied to pluralities of input qubits which have not yet taken part in any pooling layer measurement. In some embodiments, in this repeating of convolution and pooling layers, one or more of the convolving subgroups or one or more of the unitaries in any of the subsequent convolution layers 125, 127 can be different from those in the initial convolution layer 121, 123. Similarly, in some embodiments, in this repeating of convolution and pooling layers, one or more of the pooling subgroups or one or more of the unitaries in any of the subsequent pooling layers 135 can be different from those in the initial pooling layer 131. In some embodiments, in one or more of the convolution layers, the unitaries applied to convolving subgroups of qubits can be the identity map. In some embodiments, in any pooling layer other than the first pooling layer, the fraction of measured qubits can be zero, and the resulting unitary rotations of qubits can be identity maps. Subsequently, a fully connected layer 142 is applied as a unitary F on the remaining qubits. In some embodiments, the unitary F can be a multi-qubit unitary gate such as a Toffoli gate that is applied simultaneously on more than two qubits. In another example, the unitary F can be the identity map. Finally, the outcome of the circuit is obtained by measuring a fixed number of output qubits in the step 162. In some embodiments, QCNN hyperparameters such as the number of convolution and pooling layers can be fixed, and the unitaries themselves can be learned based on training sets.",
                        "While all example QCNNs presented thus far in the present disclosure apply unitary quantum gates in the convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, a person of skill in the art would understand from the present disclosure that the technique can be extended to cases where such operations are quantum channels which describe maps from generic mixed classical or quantum states to other mixed states. Similarly, while the present disclosure describes embodiments where convolution layers are applied before pooling layers, the application of pooling layers before the first set of convolution layers is also contemplated. Furthermore, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the measurement operations collapse the wavefunctions of groups of qubits onto individual basis vectors of the Hilbert space of the groups of qubits, with the probability for each basis vector determined by the state of the qubits before measurement. As a non-limiting example, in some physical implementations, each basis vector can be a product state of single-qubit states in a computational basis of the qubits (e.g., the simultaneous eigenstates of all single-qubit Pauli-Z operators). However, a person in the skill of art would understand from the present disclosure that the QCNN technique can be generalized to cases where measurements are replaced with projection operations which project the states of groups of qubits into one of a complete, orthogonal set of subspaces (of dimension possibly higher than 1) of the Hilbert space of the groups of qubits. The outcome of such a projection of the state of one or more qubits can comprise the subspace into which the state is projected. As one non-limiting example, in a physical implementation where a qudit is encoded in the d hyperfine ground state levels of a neutral atom, one such projection operation could comprise coupling one of the d levels to a cycling transition and detecting fluorescence. In this non-limiting example, the complete, orthogonal set of subspaces would contain one subspace of dimension 1, spanned by the single level coupled to the cycling transition, and one subspace of dimension d\u22121, spanned by the remaining levels. More broadly, the projections can be replaced by generalized measurements or Positive Operator-Valued Measures, in which the subspaces are not orthogonal, and the outcome of a generalized measurement of the state of one or more qubits can comprise the subspace into which the state is projected. The extensions listed above can also be made for QCNNs discussed in the remainder of this present disclosure.",

This can correspond to a double exponential reduction compared with a generic quantum circuit-based classifier and can allow for efficient learning and implementation. In some embodiments, generic quantum circuit-based classifiers could apply an arbitrary N-qubit unitary gate to the input state of N qubits before measuring the output qubit(s) and can thus be characterized by a number of parameters which grows exponentially with N.

                        "Without being bound by theory, the QCNN circuit described above can be related to two concepts in quantum information theory\u2014the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (\u201cMERA\u201d) and QEC. QEC can refer to a mechanism to detect and correct local quantum errors without collapsing the wavefunction. The MERA framework provides an efficient tensor network representation of many classes of many-body wavefunctions. The structural relationships between QCNN and MERA then suggest the applicability of the QCNN technique to problems where the wavefunctions of input quantum states can be described using MERA tensor networks, which can represent a broad class of quantum states.",
                        "Without being bound by theory, a MERA can be understood as a scheme to generate a quantum state by applying a sequence of unitary and isometry layers to an input state (for example |00), and the resulting state can be said to be represented by such a MERA scheme. While both types of layers in MERA apply quasilocal unitary gates, each isometry layer first introduces a set of new qubits in a predetermined state, such as |0. This exponentially growing, hierarchical structure allows for the long-range correlations associated with critical systems. In some aspects, the QCNN circuit operates similarly in the reverse direction. In some embodiments, for any given state |\u03c8 with a MERA representation, a QCNN can be designed to recognize |\u03c8 with deterministic outcomes at each measurement operation. For example, for each measurement performed during QCNN, the same outcome (e.g. |0>) occurs for each run of the experiment. One such QCNN comprises the inverse of the MERA circuit for |\u03c8.",
                        "In some embodiments, for input states other than |\u03c8, such a QCNN may not generally produce deterministic measurement outcomes, which means that there is more than one possibility for the measurement outcomes, and each possible outcome has a probability prescribed by the quantum state before the measurement. These additional degrees of freedom can distinguish a QCNN from a MERA. For example, the measurements can be identified as syndrome measurements in QEC. Such syndrome qubit measurements can help detect and correct errors on the quantum states. In many traditional QEC settings, syndrome measurements resulting in all |0 states denote that no error has occurred on the input state, whereas syndrome measurements resulting in the |1 state would signify error. The particular locations of the |1 states can determine the precise error that occurred or the error correction unitaries Vj to apply to the remaining qubit(s). Thus, without being bound by theory, in some embodiments a QCNN circuit with multiple pooling layers can be analogized to a combination of a MERA (a variational ansatz for many-body wavefunctions) and nested QEC. For example, without being bound by theory, FIG. 1C is a diagram showing the structural similarity of some QCNN circuits with MERA circuits. As shown in FIG. 1C, both circuits contain interleaved convolution layers 161, 163, 165 and pooling layers 171, 173, 175. In some embodiments, a QCNN circuit begins with an input set of qubits 151 in state |\u03c8, and interleaves convolution layers 161, 163, 165 (white boxes) with pooling layers 171, 173, 175 (black boxes), before applying a fully connected layer 181 (vertical striped box) to arrive at a final quantum state. As shown in exemplary pooling step 170B for QCNN, in some embodiments, a quasilocal unitary 172B (horizontally striped box) is applied to two input qubits. One of the input qubits is then measured in step 176B, while a QEC unitary rotation 174B is applied to the other input qubit. By contrast, the analogous MERA circuit would operate in the reverse direction as QCNN, beginning with a quantum state, applying the inverse unitary of the fully connected layer 181, and interleaving isometry (i.e. inverse-pooling) steps 171, 173, 175 with inverse-convolution steps 161, 163, 165. As shown in exemplary inverse-pooling step 170A for MERA, an input qubit is combined with another qubit in state |0. The unitary operation 172A, which is the inverse of the quasilocal unitary 172B, is applied to this combination of two qubits to produce the resultant two-qubit output. A pooling layer for QCNN can thus differ substantially from the corresponding inverse-pooling layer, due to the presence of the QEC unitary rotation 174B.",
                        "Without being bound by theory, an interpretation of QCNNs in terms of MERA and QEC can be applied to recognizing more generic quantum phases. In some embodiments, for any quantum phase  whose renormalization-group fixed-point wavefunction |\u03c80( has a tensor network representation in isometric or G-isometric form shown in FIG. 7A, a corresponding QCNN circuit can be systematically constructed. This family of quantum phases includes all 1D SPT and 2D string-net phases. In these cases, a commuting parent Hamiltonian H can be explicitly constructed which has |\u03c80() as a ground state. This gives rise to a MERA structure in which |\u03c80() is a fixed-point wavefunction. More specifically, in some embodiments, a matrix product state (MPS) representation of |\u03c80() in isometric or G-isometric form can be constructed from H, and this representation can be characterized by matrices at each qubit or qudit site (black boxes in 702, 704, 706 in FIG. 7A). For 1D SPT and 2D string-net phases, these all can correspond to the same matrix. A MERA representation of the state can then be constructed from this matrix, for example by placing it at locations 712, 714, 716, 718 as shown in FIG. 7A. Such a MERA has |\u03c80() as a fixed-point wavefunction: after each isometry layer, the intermediate state is in the state |\u03c80() with a different number of qubits, and the number of qubits in that state grows with each isometry layer applied. FIG. 7B is an example diagrammatic proof of this fixed-point property. In addition, any \u2018local error\u2019 perturbing an input state away from |\u03c80() can be identified by measuring a fraction of terms in the parent Hamiltonian, similar to syndrome measurements in stabilizer-based QEC. Then, a QCNN for  can comprise the MERA for |\u03c80() and a nested QEC scheme in which an input state with error density below the QEC threshold \u2018flows\u2019 to the RG fixed point. Such a QCNN can be optimized via embodiments of the disclosed learning procedure. A schematic diagram illustrating this \u2018flow\u2019 under the QCNN's nested QEC protocol is shown in FIG. 7C, where the fixed-point state is labeled by an \u2018x\u2019 790, the generic input state is labeled by a dot 780, and the action of the QCNN is labeled by a black arrow 710.",
                        "While embodiments of the disclosed learning protocol can begin with completely random unitaries, as in the classical case, such an initialization may not be the most efficient for gradient descent. In some embodiments, an initial parameterization can comprise a MERA representation of |\u03c80() and one choice of nested QEC. This is illustrated in an example in FIG. 7C where |\u03c80() is denoted by an \u2018x\u2019 790, the nested QEC action of QCNN is depicted as a black arrow 710, and the threshold of this nested QEC scheme is depicted as a dotted black circle 770. With such an initialization, the learning procedure (white-filled arrows) serves to optimize the QEC scheme, expanding its threshold 770 to the target phase boundary 760.",
                        "In some embodiments, QCNNs can be used as an architecture for classifying input quantum states. In some of these embodiments, QCNN is performed on an input set of qubits in an unknown quantum state, with the goal of determining a property or pattern of this quantum state such as a quantum phase of matter to which the state belongs. QCNN then proceeds as discussed above and measures a fraction of the final number of qubits after the last fully connected layer. The result of this measurement is indicative of the quantum phase of matter. Such processes can also be referred to as quantum phase recognition (\u201cQPR\u201d), which seeks to identify a quantum phase of matter from an initial many-body quantum state.",
                        "In some embodiments, for QPR, QCNN can provide a MERA realization of a representative state |\u03c80 in a target phase of matter. A target phase may refer to a quantum phase of matter that the QCNN circuit seeks to identify for a QPR problem, such as the phase  in the QPR problem \u201cDoes |\u03c8 belong to ?\u201d. Without being bound by theory, other input states within the same phase can be viewed as |\u03c80 with local errors, which are repeatedly corrected by the QCNN circuit in multiple layers. In other words, though the initial state may differ slightly from another state |\u03c80 in the target phase, QCNN can correct these differences like errors in QEC to ultimately produce an output that is the same or similar to the output that would be achieved by applying QCNN to the state |\u03c80. Without being bound by theory, the QCNN circuit can therefore mimic renormalization-group flow, a methodology that classifies many families of quantum phases.",
                        "For example, QCNN can be implemented for QPR in an example class of 1D many-body systems. One example includes a 2\u00d72 symmetry-protected topological (\u201cSPT\u201d) phase of matter . Without being bound by theory, unlike traditional phases of matter such as solid, liquid, or gas, which are characterized by the set of symmetries of a physical system in that phase, SPT phases can be characterized by how a physical system transforms under a given, fixed set of symmetry operations. Thus, while traditional phases of matter can be identified by performing efficient measurements of local observables, the identification of whether a state belongs to an SPT phase can involve measurement of a nonlocal string order parameter (\u201cSOP\u201d), which is an operator involving a large, extensive number of qubits proportional to the number of input qubits. Such nonlocal SOPs can be very expensive to measure as described in more detail below. In contrast, the QCNN technique can be employed to substantially reduce the overhead of identifying such phases of matter for QPR problems. In one example, the input states to the exemplary QCNN considered will be the ground states {|\u03c8G} of a family of Hamiltonians on a spin\u2212\u00bd chain with open boundary conditions:",

For example, such a gate can be implemented in a physical system with qubits encoded in neutral atoms by applying a sequence of Rydberg laser pulses to the two involved qubits. The three-qubit operations 208 represent three-qubit gates equivalent to the Toffoli gate, upon acting on the control (i.e. left and right) qubits by Hadamard gates before and after the three-qubit gate.

Without being bound by theory, these analytical and non-limiting results are limited only by finite size effects in simulations. For example, compared with SOPs, the QCNN reduces sample complexity by a factor that scales exponentially with the depth of the QCNN in numerically accessible regimes as shown in FIG. 2E, which is a graph showing the ratio of SOP sample complexity to QCNN sample complexity plotted as a function of d on a logarithmic scale for h1/J=0.5, h2/J=0.3918, and N=135 spins. In an example physical implementation, this can directly translate to a reduction in the number of experimental repetitions that need to be performed. In the numerically accessible regime (e.g., where simulations are not limited by effects arising from finite system size), this reduction of sample complexity scales exponentially as 1.73e028d. Such scaling can arise from the iterative QEC performed at each depth. As discussed in more detail below, example QCNN circuits can measure a multiscale string order parameter\u2014a sum of products of exponentially many different SOPs that remains sharp up to the phase boundary, thereby indicating effective discrimination between different phases even close to the phase boundary.",
                        "Without being bound by theory, in some embodiments the performance of the QCNN can be demonstrated by analogy to MERA and QEC. For example, QCNN can be specifically designed to contain the MERA representation of the 1D cluster state (|\u03c80) such that it becomes a stable fixed point. The 1D cluster state is the state generated by applying controlled-phase gates to all pairs of nearest-neighbor qubits starting from a product state of all qubits in an equal symmetric superposition of |0 and |1 states (note that in some embodiments, the 1D cluster state is a ground state of the Hamiltonian of Equation (3) when h1=h2=0). In other words, for a 1D cluster state, the QCNN circuit can be designed to produce another 1D cluster state of reduced size after each convolution-pooling unit. Thus, when |\u03c80 is used as input, each convolution-pooling unit produces the same state |\u03c80 with reduced system size in the unmeasured qubits, while yielding deterministic outcomes (X=1) in the measured qubits. The fully connected layer measures the SOP for |\u03c80. Without being bound by theory, when an input wavefunction is perturbed away from |\u03c80, the QCNN circuit can be analogized to a correction of such \u2018errors\u2019 from the state |\u03c80. For example, as shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B, if a single X error occurs 302, the error can propagate through the first set of convolution layers to a product of Z and X errors 312, 314, 316, if it does not commute with this first set of convolution layers applied. The first pooling layer 310 can identify the location of the original error and propagated errors based on the location of X=\u22121 measurement results 320 in the measured qubits and unitary Z-rotations 313, 318 controlled on these measurement outcomes can correct the error propagated through the circuit. Similarly, if an initial state has multiple, sufficiently separated errors (possibly in coherent superpositions), the error density after several iterations of convolution and pooling layers can be substantially smaller. If the input state converges to the fixed point, the QCNN can classify it into the SPT phase with high fidelity. Accordingly, without being bound by theory, embodiments of this mechanism resemble the classification of quantum phases based on renormalization-group flow.",
                        "In some embodiments, the disclosed QCNN architecture can be implemented on several physical platforms. Such implementations of QCNNs can involve preparation of quantum many-body input states, application of two-qubit gates at various length scales and projective measurements. For physical systems such as certain existing setups with qubits encoded in atomic states where intermediate qubit measurement and feed-forwarding is difficult, such intermediate measurements and feed-forwarding can be replaced. One non-limiting example involves the replacement of the measurement of a first qubit and single-qubit rotation of a second qubit by a unitary V+ if the measurement results in +1, and V\u2212 if the measurement results in \u22121. To replace this, an entangling two-qubit unitary between the first and second qubits can be performed, in which the first qubit acts as a control qubit and determines a rotation operator to apply to the second, target qubit. In the computational basis of the control and target qubits, the matrix corresponding to this entangling two-qubit unitary is a 4\u00d74 block diagonal matrix, with V+ in the upper left block and V\u2212 in the lower right block. The first qubit can then be disregarded in the remainder of the QCNN circuit. For example, the circuit will proceed as if this first qubit does not exist, and this first qubit will not be considered when determining the minimum distance between any two qubits. The first qubit may or may not be measured at the end of the QCNN circuit. While this non-limiting example involves a controlled-unitary operation between one control qubit and one target qubit, a person of skill in the art would understand from the present disclosure that this replacement of intermediate measurements can be generalized to cases of multiple control qubits, multiple target qubits, and/or controlled-quantum-channels instead of controlled-unitaries. These capabilities can be applied to multiple programmable quantum simulators consisting of N\u226550 qubits based on trapped neutral atoms and ions, or superconducting qubits.",

Each measurement can be followed with a unitary Vj 814, 816 applied to the remaining qubit in the contiguous block, depending on the measurement outcome. For example, the QCNN circuit can apply one unitary Vj,+ when the measurement results in +1, and another unitary Vj,\u2212 when the measurement results in \u22121. This set of convolution and pooling layers can be repeated d times, where d is the QCNN depth. Finally, the fully connected layer can consist of an arbitrary unitary F on the remaining N/nd qubits, if N/nd is a constant independent of the number N of input qudits (which is the case when d is approximately the logarithm of N with base 3). The classification output can be given by the measurement output of the middle qubit (or any fixed choice of one qubit).

                        "FIG. 5A shows a non-limiting example of using QCNN techniques to optimize QEC for a particular error model. As shown in FIG. 5A, in some embodiments, the method begins with the inverse QCNN operation 500, which encodes a single logical qubit in state |\u03c8l 502 into nine physical qubits 540 which undergo noise . Such an encoding scheme can begin with a set C of logical qubits to protect against noise, which in this non-limiting example comprises the single logical qubit in state |\u03c8l 502. The encoding scheme can then proceed by enlarging the set C with a set A of additional qubits prepared in a predetermined state, which in this case comprises two additional qubits 504 and 506 prepared in the state |0. The encoding scheme can then apply a fully connected unitary, in this case U2\u22121 510, to the enlarged set C of qubits. Next, an expansion layer EL 529 can be applied to the set C of qubits. In this non-limiting example, EL begins by dividing the set C of qubits into three expansion subgroups, one subgroup for each qubit of C. For each of these expansion subgroups, EL forms a set S comprising the single qubit in that expansion subgroup and two expansion qubits (520 and 521, or 522 and 523, or 524 and 525 respectively for each subgroup), applies a unitary 530 to S, and adds the additional expansion qubits to C. In this non-limiting example, the expansion unitary is the identity map for all expansion subgroups, and the identity maps are not shown in the figure. In some embodiments, expansion layers such as EL can correspond to inverse-pooling layers in an inverse QCNN circuit. Next, a convolving layer CL 539 can be applied to the set C of qubits, by performing convolving unitaries U1\u22121 530 to convolving subgroups of the set C. In some embodiments, convolving layers such as CL can correspond to inverse-convolving layers in an inverse QCNN circuit. Thus, in the non-limiting example, the encoding operation 500 can comprise an enlarging step, a fully connected unitary 510, one expansion layer 529, and one convolving layer 539. After a period of time where the nine qubits 540 undergo noise , QCNN 550 decodes the nine qubits to obtain the logical state \u03c1 592. In this decoding operation, the last applied layer, which in this example is a convolving layer CL 539, is reversed by applying its inverse layer 569. Because CL is a convolving layer, its inverse layer is an inverse convolving layer 569 which can comprise applying the inverse-unitaries U1 560 of the convolving unitaries U1\u22121 530. In some embodiments, inverse convolving layers such as the inverse layer of CL can correspond to convolving layers in a QCNN circuit. The next last applied layer, which in this example is an expansion layer EL 529, is then reversed by applying its inverse layer 579. Because EL is an expansion layer, its inverse layer is an inverse expansion layer 579, which can also be called the pooling layer, which comprises, for each expansion subgroup ES of EL, applying the inverse of the unitary that was applied to the set S comprising the qubits of ES and the expansion qubits corresponding to ES, measuring those additional expansion qubits (570 and 571, 572 and 573, or 574 and 575, depending on the choice of ES), applying a unitary to the qubits of ES based on the outcomes of the measurement, and removing the corresponding expansion qubits from the set C. In this non-limiting example, the unitary applied to the qubits of each expansion subgroup ES is the identity map, which is not shown in the figure. In some embodiments, inverse expansion layers such as the inverse layer of EL can correspond to pooling layers in a QCNN circuit. Next, the inverse unitary U2 580, which is the inverse of the fully connected unitary U2\u22121 510, can be applied to the set C. Finally, the state of the additional qubits of set A is measured 594 and 596, similar to the measurement performed in a QCNN circuit after a fully connected unitary (e.g. the measurement 162 discussed above with reference to FIG. 1B). Thus, in the non-limiting example, the decoding operation 550 can comprise one inverse convolving layer 569, one inverse expansion layer 579, an inverse fully connected unitary 580, and measurements 594 and 596. In some embodiments, the inverse QCNN encoding operation and QCNN decoding operation can be optimized to maximize \u03c8l|\u03c1|\u03c8l, where \u03c1 592 is the state of the one or more qubits that remain after the QCNN procedure.",

The encoding scheme introduces sets of new qubits 504, 506, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525 in a predetermined state, for example |0, and entangles them with existing qubits in fully connected quantum channels, expansion layers, and convolving layers via unitary gates Ui\u22121.

As with that case, in some embodiments, the unitaries in the repeated expansion and convolving layers can be different from the unitaries in the initial expansion and convolving layers. However, a person in the skill of art would also understand from the present disclosure that such an extension can involve a more careful book-keeping of the expansion and convolving layers that have been applied in the encoding procedure, to ensure that the layers are properly reversed in the decoding procedure. In some embodiments, this book-keeping can be done by using a list L containing information about at least one property of the layers which have been applied. The list L can be initialized as an empty list after the application of the fully connected unitary in the encoding procedure, and information about at least one property of each expansion or convolving layer can be appended to the end of L as the layer is applied. In some embodiments, properties of an applied layer can include whether the layer is an expansion layer or a convolving layer, the unitaries applied during the layer, the subgroups or sets of qubits to which each unitary was applied, and the like. During the decoding procedure, layers can be reversed by applying the inverse layers of the expansion and convolving layers applied in the encoding procedure, in the opposite order of which the layers were applied in the encoding procedure, based on the information about the at least one property of each layer in the list L.

                        "To illustrate the potential of embodiments of this procedure, a non-limiting example involving N=9 physical qubits and 126 variational parameters can be considered. The circuit evolution of the 2N\u00d72N density matrix can be simulated exactly. The encoding circuit can comprise a fully connected unitary U1\u22121, an expansion layer which introduces two expansion qubits per expansion subgroup, and a convolving layer U2\u22121, similar to the circuit shown in FIG. 5A. The decoding circuit can comprise inverse convolving and inverse expansion layers, and the inverse unitary of the fully connected unitary. Without loss of generality and without being bound by theory, the optimization over the expansion layers can be ignored by absorbing its effect into the first convolving layer. However, a person of skill in the art would understand based on the present disclosure that separate convolving and expansion layers can be included. Similarly, other sizes of convolving and expansion layers (e.g., introducing other numbers of additional expansion qubits per expansion subgroup) or more layers may be used. In this example, the generic three-qubit unitary operations U1 and U2 can be parametrized using 63 Gell-Mann coefficients each.",

FIG. 9 shows the ratio between the logical error probability (which can refer to the probability of an error getting past the QEC scheme) of the QCNN code and a Shor code plotted as a function of anisotropy, px/ptot. Because this ratio of logical error probabilities can characterize the advantage of using the QCNN code compared to a Shor code, the vertical axis in FIG. 9 is labeled as \u201cimprovement.\u201d In some embodiments, for nearly isotropic models or error model (1), the QCNN can achieve the same logical error rate as the Shor code, while for strongly anisotropic models in error model (2), the QCNN outperforms the Shor code by reducing the error rate by a constant factor up to 50%, depending on the specific input error probability ratios.",

Because of this, the total logical error probability can be computed from f as 1.5(1\u2212f). Optimization can therefore involve maximizing the logical state overlap f defined in equation (16). In some embodiments, if the gradient descent method is applied based on f directly to both U1 and U2, embodiments of the optimization can be trapped in a local optimum. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the two unitaries U1 and U2 can be optimized sequentially, similar to a layer-by-layer optimization in backpropagation for conventional CNN.",

For example, simply maximizing f with an assumption on U2, for example that it equals the identity, may not be ideal, since such a choice does not capture a potential interplay between U1 and U2. In addition, because in some embodiments U1 captures arbitrary single-qubit rotations, it can be helpful to define C1 independent of basis.

In such an example, Ucan be dominated by a \u2018flip\u2019 error along a certain axis with a strongly suppressed \u2018phase\u2019 error. In this regime, the remnant, simpler errors can be corrected by the second layer. For example, Ucan be represented using a map U: rMr+c, where r\u22083 is the Bloch vector for a qubit state \u03c1\u2261\u00bd1+r\u00b7\u03c3, where 1 is the identity operator and \u03c3=(X, Y, Z) is the vector of Pauli matrices. The singular values of the real matrix M would encode the probabilities p1\u2265p2\u2265p3 for three different types of errors. In some embodiments, the cost function for the first layer can be selected to be C1=p12+p2+p3, which can be more sensitive to p2 and p3 than p1 and can ensure that the resultant, optimized channel Uis dominated by one type of error (with probability p1). M can be efficiently evaluated from a quantum device without knowing , by performing quantum process tomography for a single logical qubit, which can characterize a single-qubit quantum channel by applying the quantum channel to various test states multiple times, and making multiple measurements of the resultant states in various bases. Once U1 is optimized, gradient descent can be used to find an optimal U2 to maximize f. As with QPR, gradients can be computed via a finite-difference method, and the learning rate can be determined by the bold driver technique.",

In this embodiment, the input error rate is defined as the sum of all probabilities and p\u03bc and pxx. As shown in FIG. 5B, the performance of the Shor code is worse than performing no error correction at all (identity, solid line), while the optimized QEC code can still substantially improve the logical error rate compared to the input error rate. This non-limiting example demonstrates the power of using QCNNs to obtain and optimize new QEC codes for realistic, a priori unknown error models.",

Similarly, other extensions can be considered in which a convolving layer is applied before the first expansion layer in the encoding procedure. Likewise, as in the case of QCNNs used for classifying and recognizing phases of matter, other contemplated extensions comprise cases where qubits are replaced by qudits, and/or where measurements are replaced by projections onto a subspace in a set of orthogonal subspaces or by generalized measurements.",

Nonlocal order parameters can then be identified with low sample complexity for lesser-understood phases such as quantum spin liquids or anyonic chains. To recognize more exotic phases, the translation-invariance constraints of some embodiments can be relaxed, resulting in O(N log(N)) parameters for system size N, or ancilla qubits could be used to implement parallel feature maps following traditional CNN architecture. Further extensions could incorporate optimizations for fault-tolerant operations on QEC code spaces. In addition, while a finite-difference scheme to compute gradients in learning demonstrations is described above, more efficient schemes such as backpropagation can be used, or other techniques (which need not be based on gradients) may be used to find optimal sets of QCNN parameters.",
