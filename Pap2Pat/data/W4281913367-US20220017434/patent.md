These and other features are disclosed in greater detail in the accompanying figures and the Detailed Description below.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Typically, Benzene, Toluene and Xylene (BTX) products are produced through catalytic reforming of naphtha. This takes higher order hydrocarbons, usually six to twelve carbon hydrocarbons and reforms them from linear type hydrocarbons into ring type hydrocarbons using a catalytic reformer [1]. Naphtha prices are currently marketed at around $500 per ton, which is more expensive than methane (CH4) and slightly cheaper than the BTX products derived from its reforming [2]. Currently this process yields 50-55% toluene. 30-35% xylenes and only about 10-15% benzene [3].

Benzene is the most widely used aromatic petrochemical in the industrial processes. Its price has been increasing over the past five years [4]. Toluene finds the largest industrial use among BTX. Its selling price has been directly linked with the crude oil as the majority of BTX production is via crude oil cracking. Thus, it is predicted that production outages and political tensions are likely to keep the price of toluene volatile in the foreseeable future. p-Xylene is the most valuable product per pound that is created in the production of BTX. The demand in the market for p-xylene is highly correlated with the demand for PET polyesters and their derived products. Tecnon OrbiChem, a UK-based consulting firm, estimates world consumption to increase by 7% per year.

With a market for BTX valued at $80.8 billion in sales per year, the three largest competitors in BTX industry are Exxon Mobil Corporation and The Dow Chemical Company, followed by Anellotech Inc., which is another smaller competitor that aims to produce BTX products from renewable sources.

Exxon Mobil Chemical is the largest North American producer of benzene and toluene and the second-largest producer of mixed xylene—holding an overall market share of 3.0%. Its sales are estimated at $2.45 billion per year and it is expected to grow at an annual rate of 15.8%.

The Dow Chemical Company holds an overall BTX market share of 2.6%. Its sales are estimated at $2.1 billion per year.

Anellotech Inc. has developed a clean technology platform to inexpensively produce BTX from renewable biomass. It is expected that their products will be cheaper when compared to petroleum derived counterparts, while providing identical benefit.

Currently, there are different approaches to produce olefins and aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylene) from different feedstock. However, these approaches suffer from one or more operational and scale up issues and high cost. Accordingly, improved systems and methods are desired for producing olefins and aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylene) with reduced cost.

The present disclosure provides a novel and innovative systems and methods to convert methane (CH4) to value-added products, specifically olefins and aromatics (Benzene, Toluene and Xylene) through low-cost techniques by utilizing a new “non-oxygen type of oxidizers” process; as well as to remove toxic impurities such as sulphur-containing compounds (i.e. H2S) by using the sulphur as a source of radical.

The present inventors have identified several approaches to convert methane to added-valuable products. These approaches are detailed below.

Because of the large amount of CH4 that is available from natural sources, it is strongly desired to develop processes for direct and indirect conversion of this substance into value-added products. Technologies deriving from these processes could represent a huge opportunity for Qatar where natural gas represents the first largest source with proven recoverable resources at 900 Trillion SCF, 2016.

Oxidative Coupling of Methane Method

Among the methods devised for direct conversion of CH4 to value-added chemicals, oxidative coupling of methane (CH4) (OCM) to produce C2 products such as C2H6 and C2H4, with C2H4 representing 50% of the hydrocarbon feedstock for the chemical industry, is the most popular. The OCM catalytic reaction was first reported by Keller and Bhasin in 1982 [5] and has attracted significant attention over the years in order to gain a deeper understanding of its fundamentals with the aim of making the OCM catalytic process commercially viable. Although OCM is not thermodynamically limited because the overall reaction is exothermic and exergonic, it is kinetically hindered and there is still needs for better performing catalysts to make OCM industrially viable [6].

The OCM catalytic reaction faces selectivity issues since the free energy change of the OCM reaction is about −154 kJ/mol at 800° C. while that of complete oxidation of CH4 into CO2 is about −801 kJ/mol [6]. In addition, the OCM catalytic process involves both heterogeneous and homogeneous reaction steps that further complicate its understanding. Fundamentally, the process involves the activation of a C—H bond of CH4 to form gaseous methyl radicals (CH3.) via a heterogeneous catalytic step followed by a gas phase homogeneous recombination step of the CH3. radicals to yield C2H6. The C2H6 can further undergo oxidative dehydrogenation over the same catalyst to form the highly desired C2H4 product. It has been reported that OCM holds the greatest potential as the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly method of converting CH4 to chemicals compared to the energy and capital-intensive indirect routes [6].

Methane Aromatization Method

Another promising gas-to-liquid (GTL) process is based on the aromatization of methane [7]. From the first study of Wang, research has been extensively carried out on this subject [8]. However, achieving a technologically viable process involves improvements in the catalyst, increases in conversions and yields and stability of the process.

New processes have been proposed for methane conversion to BTX by typically employing Metal/zeolite catalysts for benzene selectivity [9a]. Generally, Mo/ZSM-5 catalyst is chosen due to the largest combined selectivity to BTX type products and the lack of methane converted to Coke. Side products of this process include diatomic hydrogen and naphthalene. The biggest obstacle in this process lies in the large recycle stream due to the low conversion of methane by the catalyst (usually below 10%), with the recycle stream accounting for about 90% of the methane being fed into the reactor [9b]. Despite this large recycle, the process seems to be a viable option to create benzene and toluene for profit.

Mercaptans to BTX Method

Usually, the treated gas contains minor amounts of contaminants: >2% CO2, 2-4 ppm H2S and 5-30 ppm total sulfur (mercaptans and carbonyl sulphide). With the increasingly stringent environmental regulations, the technical requirements for further catalytic processes (e.g. syngas fabrication) and the specificities of newly discovered gas deposits with a mercaptan concentration range substantially higher than those hitherto known, the demand for more complete desulfurization is rising. In 2013, the group of Hulea, in collaboration with TOTAL SA, presented a way to catalytically convert CH3SH and CH3SCH3 (DMS), on protonic zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-Y and H-ferrierite and above 700 K, to light alkanes (C1-C3), benzene, toluene and xylene. They found that, at 823 K, the CH3SH conversion is total on H-ZSM-5, and only partial on H-Y and H-ferrierite. These resulted selective to alkanes and produced large quantities of coke. In contrast, much less coke builds up on H-ZSM-5, which was also more selective to aromatics. After calcination, the spent H-ZSM-5 sample recovered the properties of the fresh catalyst [10].

Later, the same group demonstrated the catalytic activity of various H-zeolite/zeotype toward conversion of CH3SH into H2S and hydrocarbons (M2TH process). The catalytic activity varied as follows: H-ZSM-5>H-Y>H-FER>H-BEA>H-MOR>H-SAPO-34. In addition, H-ZSM-5 was the most stable catalyst toward deactivation by coke. The effect of the carrier gas (nitrogen or methane) and the role of water on the catalytic behaviour of zeolites were explored under different conditions. Similar performances were obtained using CH3SH/N2 or CH3SH/CH4 mixtures, but the amount of coke drastically decreased, and the catalyst lifetime increased when 2% of water was added into the reaction [11].

As briefly mentioned above, mercaptans are of great industrial interest and are very widely used nowadays by the chemical industries, particularly as precursors or starting materials for the synthesis of more complex organic molecules. However, natural gas (NG) treatment is not the only way to isolate mercaptans. Methyl mercaptan is nowadays commonly produced industrially on the tonnage scale from methanol, with more than a few drawbacks associated with this method. In 2014, Arkema France patented a valuable alternative for the preparation of methyl mercaptan [12]. The new method comprised the reaction of methane with hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to form carbon disulphide (CH2) and hydrogen (H2), these two products would further react to yield methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and possibly hydrogen (H2). Then the methyl mercaptan can be isolated and the H2S can be recycled to further react with methane. Catalyst materials for methyl mercaptan catalytic production generally comprise molybdenum- and potassium-based active component on hydroxyapatite-based supports [13].

Data Science for Catalysis

Understanding and controlling the catalytic reactions are considered big challenges in chemistry and industry. Catalytic reactions typically involve multiple experimental factors and surface chemistries in a complex manner, making it difficult to represent with a comprehensive model. However, the implementation of data science could potentially shine a light and reveal such complex matter within catalysis, as machine learning (ML) can treat multiple factors in high dimensions [14-15].

With machine learning (ML) techniques, any catalytic process can be considered as a multi-dimensional problem. Thanks to this approach, further sophisticated catalyst design and tailored tuning of reaction conditions can be made achievable in principle. The effect of catalytic reaction conditions is usually expressed by the influence and importance of each reaction parameter on the target products by conducting reactions under various conditions, and then either find the optimal experiment conditions empirically or instinctively when the data dimensions becomes high and complex. If the effects of the reaction conditions can be organized and if accurate models can be constructed using machine learning, then it would be possible to survey the information isolating the effects of each reaction parameter and select the optimum reaction conditions from predicted data, even if the range is not investigated through experiments. Here, machine learning is implemented in order to determine the reaction conditions in heterogeneous catalysis [16].

CH4 Conversion.

Catalysts for OCM reactions have been analysed and predicted by several groups using a database consisting of nearly 2000 data sets on catalyst compositions and their performances collected from diverse published data [17]. Very recently, the group of Shimizu and Takigawa reported a statistical analysis and a proposal of novel heterogeneous catalysts for OCM using ML treatment of literature data [18]. This effort led to the development of a novel ML method considering elemental features as input representations instead of inputting catalyst compositions directly. Effective analysis of literature data by ML methods has the capability to provide valuable information. Nevertheless, utilization of literature data has obstacles such as bias from prior published data, low sample counts for many elements, and lack of composition overlaps.

The newly developed method has the potential to guide catalyst design and discovery, including those that promote reactions where limited catalyst composition overlap exists in the given data. The prediction accuracy of this approach is higher than those of conventional methods using catalyst compositions as input. Among various, state-of-the art ML models developed, gradient boosting regression with XGBoost displayed the highest level of performance to predict catalytic performance. In order to determine quantitatively the most important input variables for prediction of the catalytic performance, a feature importance score was also obtained. Moreover, a catalyst optimization procedure that uses ML as “surrogate” models identified the top 20 promising catalyst candidates. This investigation provided fundamental knowledge about catalytic processes. Moreover, it has the potential of being used to identify truly novel heterogeneous catalysts where the reported data are limited and biased because they are very noisy and inconsistent because of variations arising from the use of different instruments, procedures, and platforms.

Currently, CH4 is industrially converted through auto thermal or catalytic steam reforming to form synthesis gas (a mixture of H2 and CO), which then is used for large-scale manufacture of methanol and higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. Although these processes are already industrially viable, they suffer from harsh reaction conditions. Thus, better catalysts are needed.

The Yildirim group constructed 5508 experimental data points for steam reforming of CH4 (SRM) using 81 publications appearing between 2004 and 2014 [19]. The database was analyzed using decision trees to extract correlations, heuristics, and trends that are not identifiable using only the naked eye. Analysis of the performance variable showed that Ni, Ru, Rh, and Pt are the most frequently used active metals and that they are normally supported on Al2O3, CeO2, or ZrO2 employing impregnation methods. In addition, the analysis determined the ranges of catalyst preparation and operational conditions employed that lead to high CH4 conversion. More recently, the same group extracted knowledge for the dry reforming of CH4 (DRM) reaction from literature experimental data employing data mining tools [20]. A database having 5521 data points was constructed from 101 papers reported between 2005 and 2014.

Recently Nguyen et al developed a high throughput screening instrument for enabling an automatic performance evaluation of 20 catalysts in 216 reaction conditions [21]. This tool is based on an oxidative coupling of methane dataset comprised of 12 708 data points for 59 catalysts in three successive operations. Based on a variety of data visualization analysis, important insights into catalysis and catalyst design were successfully extracted. In particular, the simultaneous optimization of the catalyst and reactor design was found to be essential for improving the C2 yield. The consistent dataset allowed the accurate prediction of the C2 yield with the aid of nonlinear supervised machine learning.

The present disclosure is generally directed to a system, process and method for converting methane to added-valuable products, specifically olefins and aromatics (Benzene, Toluene and Xylene) through low-cost techniques, as well as to remove toxic impurities (H2S). This process involves three reactors with three different catalysts, heat integration system, separation unit (propane cycle), and Acid gas removal unit.

The present disclosure is related to Oil & Gas sector and should be considered as a large-scale technology. The expected profit per unit from this technology is $480/Ton-BTX compared to $50/Ton-methane (pipeline export rate for methane). The methane value could increase by ten times thanks to this technology.

In one aspect, the present disclosure provides an example process flow diagram for low-cost methane upgrading to more valuable products as shown in FIG. 1. The mass balance across all the process units are reported in Table 1, and the chemical reactions, catalysts and reaction conditions are shown in Table 2.

The feedstock for Reactor-A consists of recycled methane and H2S, makeup methane and liquid sulfur (S8). The reactants are mixed together at slightly positive pressure and temperature at 25-50° C. Afterwards, the reactants are first preheated in Economizer 1, followed by a fired heater derived with external fuel to elevate the reactor-A reactants to 900° C. Then, Reactor-A downstream at 711° C., will be exchanged in Economizer 2 to generate steam as waste heat recovery. The main products from Reactor-A are CS2 and H2, which are then directed to Reactor-B, where Hydrogen gas reacts with CS2 yielding CH3SH. As, reactor-B downstream recorded 434° C., it will be exchanged with boiler feed water to generate low-pressure steam as waste heat recovery. At this point, the produced CH3SH is directed to Reactor-C at 300° C. to be converted into BTX, olefins and CH4. Reactor-C downstream products are at 287° C., therefore it will be exchanged in Economizer 4 with boiler feed water to cool down its temperature while generating low-pressure steam as waste heat recovery.

Finally, all the products and by-products are going to be separated in a propane cycle by physical separation, where the bottom products are benzene, toluene, xylene and naphthalene, while the overhead products are CH4 and H2S.

The CH4—H2S is now directed to acid gas removal unit to remove the excess H2S and recycle the unreacted CH4—H2S back to Reactor-A.

Reactor A: Methane Activation

The first reaction to convert methane and hydrogen sulfide to carbon disulfide (CH2) and hydrogen (H2) in Reactor A can achieve up to 100% conversion rate (complete conversion), and the selectivity of the conversion of the methane and hydrogen sulfide is 100% selectivity to CS2 using the present first catalyst Pt/Al2O3. The outlet temperature of the Reactor A is about 711° C. Increasing the liquid sulfur content will decrease the reaction temperature

Reactor B: Methyl Mercaptan Synthesis

The conversion rate of the reaction in Reactor B was recorded 86.94% conversion. Unreacted CS2 will accumulate in the system due to insufficient H2. Adding hydrogen would enhance the synthesis reaction and ensure 100% CS2 conversion to CH3SH. The outlet temperature of Reactor B is about 434° C. as it is an exothermic reaction.

Reactor C: Methyl Mercaptan Conversion

The product distributions of the conversion reactions in the Reactor C are shown in Table. 3. The outlet temperature of Reactor C is about 287° C.

The advantages of the novel and innovative systems and methods of the present disclosure disclosed above are summarized below and for example.

First, the present disclosure provides a low-cost process technology for methane upgrading to olefins and aromatics with only 3.36% methane makeup, while the rest is recycled (See FIG. 1).

Second, the present disclosure introduces a waste-heat-recovery system to reduce the fuel gas required to heat the feedstock up to 900° C. Economizers 1, 2, 3 and 4 were added before and after the reactors A, B and C to allow heat exchanging the process streams with water to generate low-pressure superheated steam and to condition the process streams for the following operations. The superheated steam will be exchanged with the combined feed, recycled stream and liquid-sulfur in a new preheater heat exchanger (Economizer-1). This heat integration saves 61% of the required fuel gas to heat the reactants up to 900° C., which corresponds to a saving of $36/Ton-BTX produced.

Third, using conventional Distillation column for BTX, naphthalene, CH4 and H2S separation is not recommended due to the wide temperature difference (−80° C. to 130° C., See FIG. 2.), which would affect the material mechanical properties and thus its lifetime. The Temperature profile for conventional BTX separation using distillation column is described in FIG. 2. Hence, physical separation is here proposed by using Propane cycle as a refrigerant to condense the BTX as a bottom product and release the non-condensable gases (CH4 and H2S) as a top product.

The typical propane cycle is applied without adding economizer nor 2nd compressor. The propane cycle could achieve high BTX separation recovery as shown in Table 4. Moreover, instead of using cooling tower, Air coolers are proposed as the cheapest cooling method and design outlet temperature is set at 57° C. to match Qatar summer/design conditions.

Fourth, H2S removal is required since the CH4/H2S ratio is 6.8:1 directly after the aromatics separation. Therefore, to recycle unconverted CH4 and H2S at the desired ratios about 1:1 to about 20:1, such as about 10:1 or 20:1. An Acid Gas Removal (AGR) unit was added (see FIGS. 3, 4a and 4b). Accordingly, the low-cost process technology for methane upgrading to olefins and aromatics generate only 3.36% methane makeup, while the rest is recycled (see FIG. 1), excess H2S will be purged from AGR unit.

This step reduces the feedstock cost and unit production cost as well as increasing the unit profit. Using AMP as solvent, H2S Loading records 0.5534 mol-H2S/mol-Amine. In addition, Claus process could be integrated to recover sulfur rather than flaring/incinerating the stripped H2S.

Fifth, using Gibbs/equilibrium reaction hypothesis, thermodynamic study was conducted on the complete process parametrizing different reactant ratios CH4/H2S (about 10:1, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, or 1:30), reactor feed temperature (about 25, 125, 225, 325, 425, 525, 625, 725, 825, 925, 1025, 1125, 1225, 1325, 1425, or 1525 ° C.) and feed pressure (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29 bar).

The findings of the thermodynamic study are listed below. The low-pressure operation is favorable for methane conversion using sulfur as source of radical. Slightly positive pressure (about 1-3) bar is recommended. Reaction-A is endothermic (similar to steam reforming). The higher is the temperature; the better is reaction conversion (see FIG. 5). The H2S conversion in Reactor A is illustrated in FIG. 5. Adding liquid sulfur will ensure complete sulfur conversion and reduce the heating requirements as the sulfur-methane reaction is exothermic. Increasing the methane to H2S ratio (up to 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1) would increase reaction conversion, boost desired products yield, and reduce undesired by-products. Increasing CH3SH synthesis reaction temperature up to 500° C. instead of 250° C. will boost CS2 conversion from 86% to 99%.

Six, Machine Learning (ML) models were developed to derive an analytical approximation of the nonlinear relationship between the complete set of inputs and the observed simulated outputs of the methane-upgrading (MU) process. These functions are used to accurately extrapolate the performance of the MU system for any given combination of the input control parameters at a much lower computational cost compared to process simulation tools. Higher-order Multivariate Polynomial regression models (HMP) are used to fit the variation of each single dependent variable of the system, given the variability of all the independent inputs. The selection of the nth order of the polynomial model for each dependent variable is set though 10-fold cross-validated minimization of the overall Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE) of the regression residuals relative to the average of the observed output. Given ranges of CH4—H2S feed-ratio (FR) between 0.4248 and 21.2203, pressure (P) between 1.0 and 29.0 bar, and temperature (T) between 25.0 and 1530.0° C. as input of the MU system, the below equations are retrieved for each output through least square unbiased estimation of the polynomial regression coefficients (terms with null coefficients are omitted):

The preliminary Techno-economic analysis shows a viable process for BTX production. The preliminary Techno-economics summary is described in FIG. 10.

There are many techniques to produce olefins and aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylene). Most of which have methane as feedstock or through Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The latest technology for methane conversion to olefins and aromatics is called Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM, see FIG. 11). The OCM Schematic block diagram is described in FIG. 11.

The OCM process targets to produce olefins and aromatics by combustion of methane with pure oxygen or air. This process suffers from multiple operational and scale up issues, including: Low reaction conversion (<10%); Low selectivity to desired products and high yield for side and by-products; Highly exothermic reaction; Potential explosion hazards; Formation of Hot spots; Catalyst deactivation; Utilization of pure oxygen, which is expensive and requires an air-separation plant; and Separation techniques are expensive and complicated.

Moreover, Qatar has the opportunity to increase the benefit of its natural gas reserves, in addition to liquefaction and exportation as LNG or burning it for power generation.

On top of that, H2S is always accompanied with raw natural gas extracted from gas/oil wells, which require treatments using acid gas removal plants followed by Claus process for sulfur recovery.

Reserves of natural gas and oil in Qatar are among the largest ones in the world, with the Oil and Gas sector constituting the backbone of the country's economy.

In the field of oil and gas, sulphur represents the Achilles heel for fuel production and plants maintenance. Natural gas and oil contain H2S and a wide variety of organic sulphur-based compounds (Such as Methyl Mercaptan CH3SH). These must be removed before the natural gas can be used as a feedstock for the chemical industry because of their poisonous effect. Equally, they have to be removed if natural gas or oil are to be used as fuels. Otherwise, large amounts of sulphur dioxide, a very dangerous pollutant, will be released into the atmosphere when the fuels are burnt. Additionally, H2S is one of the main causes of costly corrosion in refinery plants. Qatar is also home to one of the world's largest sulphur processing plants, in the Ras Laffan industrial zone, which converts sulphur from the giant North Field gas field into fertilizer and other valuable products.

In this scenario, despite the remarkable number of academic and industrial entities in the country, involved in the field of oil and gas, applied research including sulphur-containing compounds is extremely limited because of the high toxicity of such chemicals. In addressing the challenge, Qatar Foundation would have the opportunity to be the leading edge in this field, and contribute significantly to Qatar's economy, the whole Gulf region, and the world.

The present disclosure focuses on a new “Non-oxygen type of oxidizers” process for methane upgrading to produce products that are more valuable as well as removing the toxic impurity (sulphur compounds) by utilizing the Sulphur as a source of radical. The global aim is to convert the Methyl-Mercaptan to much more valuable aromatics and olefins.

This technology of the present disclosure has multiple benefits including the following. This technology creates values for the country's economy, as the expected unit profit out from this technology is $480/Ton-BTX compared to $50/Ton-methane (pipeline export rate for methane). The methane value could be upgraded ten-folds by using this technology. The removal of H2S and other sulfur poisonous compounds through a low-cost conversion process rather than removing the sulfur and disposing is cost effective. This technology tackles the existing problems in the current OCM technologies. Using the present technology protects the environment from flaring compounds such as SO2.

The present disclosure provides, for example: 1) Completing the process flow diagram for the conversion, integration and separation process (See FIG. 1); 2) Using process simulation tools (Aspen Engineering and ProMax) for simulating this technology to calculate the process streams balance, utility consumption and equipment performance at design conditions; 3) Calculating the system mass and heat balance (See Table. 1); 4) Conducting techno-economic analyses to determine the system overall performance and competitiveness compared to technologies currently available in the market. (See Table 5-7 and FIGS. 6-10); 5) Conducting thermodynamic parametric analysis on different feed ratios, reaction conditions (Pressure & Temperature) to derive the optimum operating conditions. (see FIG. 5); 6) Utilizing machine learning models to reproduce the effect of each control parameter (Feed ratio, Pressure and Temperature) on the main output parameters (H2S conversion, CS2 conversion, BTX production rate, side product CH4 rate and undesired H2S rate), for any combination of inputs; and 7) Using variance-based sensitivity analysis techniques in combination with the learning models to determine the simultaneous multi-input/multi-output relationship between the different parameters of the MU system and assessing how much each single input contributes to each other outputs in terms of their variance (first-order), or how the paired interactions of the inputs influences the different outputs (second-order).

Data

The available data set consists of a total of 384 simulated observations of the 8 outputs under study (H2S Conv. %, CS2 Conv. %, Naphthalene, p-Xylene, Toluene, Benzene, H2S, and Methane) given the variation of 3 input variables (feed-ratio, pressure, and temperature). Table 8 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the inputs and outputs used for this study. The process simulation for methane upgrading technology is described in FIG. 12.

Methodology

A regression fit is first performed to accurately approximate the nonlinear multivariable relationship between the three independent variables (inputs) and each dependent variable (output). Higher-order Multivariate Polynomial regression models (HMP) have been used to minimize the residual sum of squares between the simulated observations and the targets predicted by the learning function (see eq. 1, with n as the power order and i to identify the specific input). The selection of the Nth degree is performed through 10-fold cross-validation minimization of the relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE, see eq. 2) to both reduce the likelihood of overfitting and to maximize the generalization of the final solution.

Following is the mathematical expression of the HMP model that fits the functional relationship between the set of inputs (x1, x2, x3, i.e.: feed-ration, pressure and temperature) and each single output:

\(\begin{matrix}
{{Output} = {{{HMP}_{n}\left( {x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}} \right)} = {\beta_{0} + {\sum\limits_{i_{1},i_{2},{i_{3} < n}}{\beta_{i_{1},i_{2},i_{3}}x_{1}^{i_{1}}x_{2}^{i_{2}}x_{3}^{i_{3}}}} + ɛ}}} & (1)
\end{matrix}\)

With βi1,2,i3 the polynomial regression coefficients and ∈ the residual error.

Below is instead the mathematical expression of the performance measure used to select the nth degree order of the HMPn model for each output, the relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE), where for relative it is considered its normalization to the variable mean value.

\(\begin{matrix}
{{rRMSE} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N}\left( {{output}_{{obs}_{i}} - {output}_{{est}_{i}}} \right)^{2}}{N}}}{{avearge}\left( {output}_{obs} \right)}} & (2)
\end{matrix}\)

With N, as the number of observations, outputobs the observed values of the output and outputest the output result estimated by the model.

If the cross-validated rRMSE results higher than 3% for any of the output function, more advanced machine learning models such as gradient boosted regression trees, are tested as alternative regression model tools to run the consecutive sensitivity analysis.

For the variance-based sensitivity analysis the so-called Sobol indices is used. This technique decomposes the variance of the output of the model under study into fractions, which can be attributed to the different inputs of the system. For each input of the system, this analysis tool gives the measures of sensitivity of the specific input on the final output in terms of changes in variance. The advantage in using variance-based measures of sensitivity is that they measure sensitivity across the whole input space, they can deal with non-linear responses, and they can measure the effect of interactions in non-additive systems.

The sensitivity of each input is here presented in terms of sensitivity indices:


- - First-order indices: measure the contribution to the output variance
    by each single model input alone: how much the output changes due to
    the changes of each specific input.
  - Second-order indices: measure the contribution to the output
    variance caused by the interaction of two model inputs: how much the
    output changes due to the combined-change of each specific couple of
    inputs (e.g. change in y due to x₁-x₂ interaction).
  - Total-order index: measures the contribution to the output variance
    caused by a model input, including both its first-order effects (the
    input varying alone) and all higher-order interactions.

Results

Claim number 6 reports the polynomial equation of each output of the MU system with the respective multivariate and multi-order-effect β coefficients of the trained HMP models. Following are the results of the sensitivity analysis:
