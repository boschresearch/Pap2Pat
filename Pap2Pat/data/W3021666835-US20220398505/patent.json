                    "paragraphs": [
                        "In view of the demand for extended-range prediction and the development of seamless prediction services, traditional numerical weather prediction based on atmospheric models is developing in the direction of coupled models and coupled assimilation technology. Compared with the coupled models, coupled assimilation is in the early stage of development. Assimilation methods face many challenging problems, and also it is a major challenge for assimilation methods to interact with the computer science in the aspect of how to build a general coupled assimilation framework.",
                        "Four-dimensional variational method (4D-Var) based on optimal control and ensemble Kalman filter based on ensemble prediction are widely used advanced assimilation methods in services, and both have advantages and disadvantages. However, a hybrid assimilation method that organically combines ensemble and variation (such as ensemble three-dimensional variational method, ensemble four-dimensional variational method, etc.) can effectively avoid the disadvantages of the both, and it gradually becomes the mainstream of data assimilation technologies in the future numerical prediction. When assimilation algorithms based on the same model ensemble prediction, such as ensemble Kalman filter or hybrid assimilation, are used to construct a coupled assimilation system (referred to as an ensemble coupled assimilation system), it is necessary to realize the interaction between all ensemble members of the corresponding coupled model and the assimilation algorithm.",
                        "The offline interaction based on file reading and writing is the earliest implementation method. Its basic concept is as shown in FIG. 1: continue maintaining the independence of operation between all ensemble members of the model and the assimilation module (i.e., the ensemble members of the model and the assimilation module perform independently), agree on the data file interface (data file format, variable name, etc.), and use the script control to realize the alternate restart, operation and interaction between the ensemble members the model and the assimilation module. Accordingly, this implementation method can keep the codes of the model and assimilation module unchanged as much as possible, so it is easy to be realized. This implementation method are adopted by many ensemble coupled assimilation systems, such as DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) developed by NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) in the United States, CDA (coupled data assimilation) developed by GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) in the United States, GSI_EnKF (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation_Ensemble Kalman Filter) developed by DTC (Developmental Testbed Center) in the United States, etc. Nonetheless, the implementation method suffers from the obvious disadvantage of low computational efficiency due to the high overhead of data file reading and writing operations and software (for the model and the assimilation modules) restarting process, and poor parallel scalability (e.g., FIG. 2). As the model resolution and assimilation frequency increase, the overhead of software restarting and data file reading and writing will continue to increase, while the operating speed of the assimilation system will continuously decrease. As a result, the timeliness of prediction results is limited, and even the prediction in the specified length of time cannot be completed within the wall clock time.",
                        "In order to avoid the above problems of offline interaction, PDAF (Parallel Data Assimilation Framework) that supports online interaction is developed by AWI (Alfred-Wegener-Institut fur Polar- und Meeresforschung) in Germany. Its basic concept is as shown in FIG. 2: realize the parallel operation of all ensemble members of the model in the same MPI (i.e., the Message Passing Interface, configured to program parallel programs, and via MPI, almost all models realize parallel versions) task, realize direct calling of the same assimilation algorithm by all ensemble members of the model, and develop an MPI-based interaction module between the ensemble members of the model and the assimilation algorithm, so as to realize online interaction without file reading and writing and avoid restarting of the model. Although PDAF integrates multiple ensemble assimilation algorithms and has been applied to the development of assimilation systems of multiple models, its online interaction method is difficult to support coupled models. That is, it is difficult for PDAF to support the coupled assimilation, because 1) PDAF requires assimilated component models to use all of the MPI process, while in most coupled models, one component model only uses part of the MPI process of the coupled model; 2) in the coupled assimilation experiment, it may need to use different assimilation algorithms to assimilate multiple component models, but PDAF allows the use of only one assimilation algorithm, which imposes a limit on coupled assimilation. In addition, PDAF requires the assimilation algorithm to only use the MPI process of the first ensemble member of the model, which imposes a limit on the operating speed of the assimilation algorithm.",
                        "To sum up, the current development of ensemble coupled assimilation faces severe technical challenges. There is no ensemble coupled assimilation framework which is realized based on efficient online interaction method all over the world. Only the inefficient offline interaction method based on file reading and writing can be used to develop the ensemble coupled assimilation system."
