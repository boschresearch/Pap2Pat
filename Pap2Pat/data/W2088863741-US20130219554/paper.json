    "title": "Long-Distance Translocation of Protein during Morphogenesis of the Fruiting Body in the Filamentous Fungus, Agaricus bisporus",
    "date": "2011-12-06",
    "abstract": "Commercial cultivation of the mushroom fungus, Agaricus bisporus, utilizes a substrate consisting of a lower layer of compost and upper layer of peat. Typically, the two layers are seeded with individual mycelial inoculants representing a single genotype of A. bisporus. Studies aimed at examining the potential of this fungal species as a heterologous protein expression system have revealed unexpected contributions of the mycelial inoculants in the morphogenesis of the fruiting body. These contributions were elucidated using a dual-inoculant method whereby the two layers were differientially inoculated with transgenic \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) and wild-type (WT) lines. Surprisingly, use of a transgenic GUS line in the lower substrate and a WT line in the upper substrate yielded fruiting bodies expressing GUS activity while lacking the GUS transgene. Results of PCR and RT-PCR analyses for the GUS transgene and RNA transcript, respectively, suggested translocation of the GUS protein from the transgenic mycelium colonizing the lower layer into the fruiting body that developed exclusively from WT mycelium colonizing the upper layer. Effective translocation of the GUS protein depended on the use of a transgenic line in the lower layer in which the GUS gene was controlled by a vegetative mycelium-active promoter (laccase 2 and \u03b2-actin), rather than a fruiting body-active promoter (hydrophobin A). GUS-expressing fruiting bodies lacking the GUS gene had a bonafide WT genotype, confirmed by the absence of stably inherited GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker activities in their derived basidiospores and mycelial tissue cultures. Differientially inoculating the two substrate layers with individual lines carrying the GUS gene controlled by different tissue-preferred promoters resulted in up to a \u223c3.5-fold increase in GUS activity over that obtained with a single inoculant. Our findings support the existence of a previously undescribed phenomenon of long-distance protein translocation in A. bisporus that has potential application in recombinant protein expression and biotechnological approaches for crop improvement.",

                "The mushroom-bearing fungus, Agaricus bisporus, is a common soil inhabitant that thrives through the secondary decomposition of dead and decaying plant material associated with forests and grasslands in North America and Europe [1], [2]. Apart from playing a role as a decomposer of plant litter in its ecological niche, the commercial cultivation of this fungal species, commonly known as white button, portabella, and crimini mushrooms, represents a major agricultural enterprise worldwide [3].",
                "Agaricus bisporus is commercially cultivated in a composted mixture of plant and animal waste products [4]. The prepared compost is seeded with sterilized cereal grain colonized by the vegetative mycelium of A. bisporus. Once colonized by the mushroom fungus, the compost is overlaid with a layer of peat that serves as a water reservoir for the developing fruiting body (mushroom). A common practice is to seed the upper peat layer with a second mycelial inoculant [5], [6]. Cellular fusion of the mycelia occurring at the junction of the upper and lower substrates results in the formation of a singular mycelial network, thereby allowing for the symplastic movement of nutrients from the compost-borne mycelium into the developing fruiting body. Within three weeks of applying the peat layer, fruiting bodies form and continue to develop in a rhythmic fashion at about weekly intervals.",
                "Since the commercial cultivation process provides for the large-scale, rapid, and inexpensive production of biomass, and methods are available for transgenic manipulation, studies were undertaken to examine A. bisporus as an expression system for recombinant proteins, such as biologics and industrial enzymes. Herein, we report on the expression patterns of the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter protein in the fruiting body when transgenic lines carrying different GUS gene promoters were employed as inoculants for the growth substrate. We provide evidence that the genotype of the fruiting body is determined largely by the genotype of the A. bisporus inoculant used in the upper substrate layer and demonstrate the long-distance translocation of GUS protein from the compost-borne mycelium into the developing fruiting body."

                        "Our experimental protocol for producing fruiting bodies of A. bisporus employed the conventional bi-layered substrate consisting of an upper peat layer and a lower compost layer (Fig. 1A). To examine protein expression patterns, we used a dual-inoculant method whereby the two layers were differentially inoculated with a WT line and a transgenic line carrying the GUS gene controlled by a native promoter. Most studies employed line HGS carrying the fruiting body-specific hydrophobin A (HYPHA) promoter [7], line LGS carrying the vegetative mycelium-active laccase 2 (LCC2) promoter [8], [9], and line AGS with the constitutive \u03b2-actin (ACTN) promoter [10], [11]. Details for the various transgenic lines, promoters, and transgenic notations are provided in Table 1. By using two different inoculants, the level of GUS enzyme activity in the fruiting body provided a measure of the individual roles of the vegetative mycelia colonizing the upper and lower substrates. Our notation system for a dual-inoculant treatment was expressed as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator indicated the upper- and lower-layer inoculants, respectively (Fig. 1B).",
                        "Throughout our study, two or three independent transformants for each of the lines HGS, LGS, and AGS were employed for the dual-inoculant method. Independent transformants for a particular GUS line varied in their level of GUS activity, but displayed an identical behavior as an inoculant. In all cases, the use of a GUS line either alone or paired with a WT line as an inoculant treatment resulted in a normal timing of development and morphology of the fruiting body."

                        "Initial experiments compared the level of GUS enzyme activity in fruiting bodies grown using either a transgenic inoculant in the upper layer and a WT inoculant in the lower layer or a transgenic inoculant in both layers. We observed that the promoter used to express the GUS gene had a profound effect on the behavior of the transgenic line when used as an inoculant. For example, when line HGS carrying the GUS gene controlled by the HYPA promoter was used to inoculate the upper layer and with a WT line-inoculated lower layer (HGS/WT), the fruiting bodies expressed 80% of the GUS activity observed for the treatment HGS/HGS where both layers were seeded with the transgenic inoculant (Fig. 1C ; Table 2). In sharp contrast, employing either of two independent transformants (3 and 412) of line LGS that carried the GUS gene driven by the LCC2 promoter resulted in a<5% retention of GUS activity (LGS-3/WT and LGS-412/WT).",
                        "Despite the marked reduction in enzyme activity using line LGS in the upper layer alone, the findings of qPCR analysis revealed a comparable GUS transgene dose in LGS/LGS- and LGS/WT-fruiting bodies with high and low GUS activity, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, the dramatic loss of GUS activity observed with line LGS was not attributed to a diminution of the transgene dose, reflecting a chimeric fruiting body formed by the intermixing of WT and transgenic mycelia. Moreover, these findings were consistent with the mycelium in the upper layer playing a dominant role in formation of the fruiting body, as the presence of WT mycelium in the lower layer did not dilute the transgene dose in the fruiting body.",
                        "To further elucidate the relationship between GUS activity and genotype as a function of the spatial positioning of transgenic lines LGS, HGS, and AGS in the growth substrates, fruiting bodies were subjected to PCR and RT-PCR analyses for the GUS gene and RNA transcript, respectively. Irrespective of the GUS line and promoter used to express the GUS gene, the genotype of the fruiting body was determined by the genotype of the inoculant in the upper layer. Thus, the 163-bp GUS amplicon, which was indicative of the GUS gene and mRNA, was detected in the fruiting body only when a transgenic inoculant was applied to the upper layer (Fig. 2C, D, G, H, K, L). This finding agreed with the results of qPCR analysis (Table 3) revealing that the transgene dose was unaffected by a WT-colonized lower layer. Hence, the upper-layer mycelium appears to play a primary role in the formation of the primordium giving rise to the fruiting body, quite possibly to the near-complete exclusion of the mycelium colonizing the lower layer. However, the PCR and qPCR data could not explain why high-level GUS activity using line LGS was dependent on the use of the transgenic line in the lower layer. This strong reliance of GUS activity in the fruiting body on transgenic mycelium in the lower layer combined with the absence of the GUS gene in the fruiting body tissue suggested a GUS element, either the protein or the RNA transcript, was translocated from the compost-born mycelium into the developing fruiting body."

                        "While the genotype of the inoculant in the upper layer strictly governed the presence or absence of the GUS gene and RNA transcript in the fruiting body, this genotype was not highly predictive of GUS enzyme activity. Most notably, the WT/LGS and WT/AGS combinations produced fruiting bodies showing high GUS activity, but completely lacking the GUS transgene and transcript (Fig. 2E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L). The WT makeup of the GUS-expressing WT/LGS-fruiting body was confirmed by the absence of stably inherited GUS and hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT) selectable marker activities in its derived mycelial tissue cultures (Fig. 3C, D) and basidiospores (Fig. S1). However, these mycelial cultures invariably displayed a passive HPT activity, suggesting translocation of an HPT element as well (Fig. 3D insert 2). Conversely, and as predicted by our hypothesis, stably inherited GUS and HPT activities were observed in mycelial cultures and basidiospores of LGS/LGS- and LGS/WT-fruiting bodies that were PCR-positive for the GUS gene.",
                        "The incongruity between the GUS genotype and phenotype can only be explained if the GUS enzyme was not synthesized in the fruiting body and upper-layer mycelium, but was transported as either protein or mRNA from the lower-layer mycelium. However, RT-PCR analysis showed that fruiting bodies with high-level GUS activity did not contain the GUS transcript; therefore, the translocated element must be the GUS protein. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that organogenesis of the fruiting body in A. bisporus is associated with a process that enabled the movement of the GUS protein from the vegetative mycelium colonizing the lower compost layer into the developing reproductive tissues."

                        "To more fully explore the long-distance movement of GUS protein, GUS expression patterns in the fruiting body were determined using transgenic lines HGS, LGS, and AGS as inoculants. Consistent with the observations from the studies described above supporting the translocation of GUS protein from the lower layer-mycelium to the fruiting body, fruiting bodies for the HGS/WT treatment retained \u223c70% of the activity and those for the LGS/WT treatment<5% of the activity relative to their respective fully transgenic substrate treatment (Fig. 2A, B, E, F). These findings substantiated our hypothesis that the GUS protein passed from the LGS mycelium in the lower layer to the fruiting body. Similar to line HGS, line AGS showed an approximate 50% yield of GUS activity in fruiting bodies in treatment AGS/WT compared to AGS/AGS (Fig. 2I, J).",
                        "Each dual-inoculant treatment was also examined in the inverse conformation, placing the WT inoculant in the upper layer and GUS inoculant in the lower layer. This resulted in a reversal of the GUS expression pattern for the lines HGS and LGS. Fruiting bodies from the WT/HGS now retained<5% of the GUS activity (Fig. 2A, B), suggesting maximal enzyme activity was dependent on the mycelium of this line being directly involved in the formation of the fruiting body from the upper layer. On the other hand, WT/LGS-fruiting bodies yielded 80% of the maximal GUS activity (Fig. 2E, F), which was consistent with the translocation of the GUS protein from the compost-borne LGS mycelium. Line AGS proved largely unaffected by the spatial transposition of the inoculants, as fruiting bodies from AGS/WT and WT/AGS showed similar levels of GUS activity (Fig. 2I, J), which would be expected for a transgenic contributing equally from both layers. While the results of these studies further supported the long-distance movement of GUS protein, they also illustrated how differences in the GUS transgene promoter led to marked differences in the behavior of the transgenic inoculants."

                        "Variation in GUS accumulation in fruiting bodies for different transgenic lines of A. bisporus can be explained by differences in the tissue-specificity of their promoters driving expression of the GUS gene. To help clarify this phenomenon, the tissue-preferred expression of the promoters used in this study was confirmed by a GUS activity assay of the mycelium colonizing the compost (Fig. S2), and was corroborated by a determination of the relative abundance of their cognate RNA transcripts based on a comparative transcriptome analysis (Table 1) and fruiting body cDNA library (Fig. S3). For example, the LCC2 gene is highly expressed in the vegetative mycelium of A. bisporus [8], [9]. Consequently, in the WT/LGS treatment (Fig. 2E, F), line LGS carrying the strong mycelium-active LCC2 promoter supported synthesis of the GUS protein in the lower layer (Fig. S2), which was then translocated to the fruiting body that developed exclusively from the WT mycelium in the upper layer. Inverting the inoculants (LGS/WT) produced fruiting bodies that contained the GUS gene, because the upper inoculant determined the genotype, but showed a markedly diminished GUS activity, because GUS protein was no longer translocated from the WT mycelium in the lower layer (Fig. 2E, F, G, H). The low GUS activity displayed by the latter fruiting bodies reflected a low-level expression in the fruiting body tissue and/or mycelium colonizing the thin upper layer of peat.",
                        "In contrast to the LCC2 promoter, the HYPA promoter is highly active in the fruiting body, rather than the vegetative mycelium (Table 1; Figs. S2 and S3) [7]. As such, appreciable GUS activity only resulted when an HGS line was applied to the upper layer, where the fruiting body formed exclusively from its mycelium (Fig. 2A, B). The low-level GUS activity associated with fruiting bodies grown from WT/HGS inoculant combination reflected the translocation of a low-level of GUS that had been synthesized in the compost-borne mycelium (Fig. S2; Note: trace GUS activity was observed on the filter paper discs, but it is difficult to resolve in the photographic reproduction).",
                        "Finally, the combined data from the transcriptome analysis (Table 1), GUS activity assay of compost-borne mycelium (Fig. S2), and cDNA library (Fig. S3) indicated the constitutive expression of the ACTN gene in both the vegetative mycelium and reproductive fruiting body tissues in A. bisporus, which agrees with its behavior in other fungal species [10], [11]. Hence, constitutive expression explained why the AGS line produced appreciable GUS activity when paired with a WT inoculant positioned in either the upper or lower layer. GUS protein was synthesized and translocated from the lower-layer mycelium as well as synthesized in situ in the fruiting body and in the upper-layer mycelium (Fig. 2I, J)."

To this end, we independently paired an LGS line carrying the mycelium-preferred LCC2 promoter as the lower-layer inoculant with three GUS lines carrying fruiting body-preferred promoters as the upper-layer inoculants. The latter lines were HGS, DGS carrying the fruiting body-specific D (FBSD) promoter, and LnGS carrying the lectin (LCTN) promoter (Table 1). Figure 4 demonstrates increased GUS activity resulted for each inoculant pair relative to the level obtained with the single inoculant. The increase in enzyme activity ranged from 1.5-fold for line DGS to 3.6-fold for line HGS. Thus, an appreciation for the protein translocation phenomenon enables the rationale design of transgene constructs for the purpose of achieving increased recombinant expression in A. bisporus."

                        "To our knowledge, long-distance intercellular translocation of protein has not been described in filamentous fungi. Fungi carry out extracellular digestion of complex polymers in the environmental substrate through the action of an array of secreted hydrolytic enzymes, which is followed by the uptake and intercellular transport of simple molecules and low-molecular weight breakdown products to the actively growing hyphal tips in the mycelial network [12]. However, the recruitment of functional protein from the vegetative mycelial network in the compost substrate might offer the fungus a more favorable conservation of metabolic resources and increased speed of development relative to the complete reliance on the de novo synthesis of protein within the fruiting body. The translocation phenomenon may be analogous in principle to the conservative processes of autophagy [13], [14] and autolysis [15], [16], which are inherent in filamentous fungi and involve the reallocation of nutrients from mature mycelium to support nascent cell growth and development.",
                        "Our ability to so clearly observe intercellular protein translocation in A. bisporus was attributed to the unique bi-layered cultivation substrate and unexpected absence of extensive intermixing of WT and transgenic mycelia following their physical union at the interface of the two substrate layers. Cellular fusion of the two mycelial networks could conceivably signal apical-dominant polarized growth [17], [18] of the actively growing hyphal tips in the upper peat layer, which would account for the dominance of the upper-layer inoculant in determining the genotype of the fruiting body.",
                        "A remaining fundamental question is whether the directed mobilization of protein involves an active or passive source-sink process. For example, proteins might be transported by mass flow from the mycelium along a mannitol concentration gradient, which has been implicated in the osmotic influx of water into the developing fruiting body [19]\u2013[21]. Alternatively, translocation could involve the reiteration of well-characterized intracellular processes for transport via the cytoskeleton [22] and tubular vesicles [23]. An intriguing possibility that warrants investigation is the rapid movement through specialized transport pathways, such as cords and rhizomorphs [20], [24]. Regardless of the precise process, translocation of the GUS protein, presumably in the 275-kDa homotetrameric active form, likely occurs via the dolipore septum, which is a perforation in the cross wall connecting adjacent hyphal cells [25]."
