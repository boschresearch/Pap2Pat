                        "About 40% of the commercially available enzymes are derived from filamentous fungi. Lowe, Handbook of Applied Mycology. Fungal Biotechnology (eds.) Arora, D. K. Elander, R. P. & Mukerji, K. G. 681-708 (Marcel Dekker, New York; 1992). These enzymes are usually produced by species of the genera Aspergillus and Trichoderma. Because they secrete large amounts of protein into the medium, they can be grown in large-scale fermentation, and they are generally accepted as safe for the food industry.",
                        "General problems associated with the commercial cultivation of mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) include diseases caused by pathogens like Verticillium fungicola (dry bubble), Trichoderma aggressivum (green mold), Pseudomonas tolaasii (blotch), and dsRNA viruses (La France disease and patch disease), the major insect pest [sciarid fly (Lycoriella mali)], an extremely short shelf life of the product related to bacterial spoilage and rapid senescence, and browning (bruising) of the fruit body associated with the action of endogenous poly-phenoloxidases (PPO, like tyrosinase). To further improve product quality, conventional breeding programs for A. bisporus have been only moderately successful and may not be sufficient in the long term. This is because conventional breeding techniques for fungi are highly time consuming, and because the genetic variation in commercially available strains is limited, offering little advancement by selection (Horgen et al. \u201cHomology between mitochondrial DNA of A. bisporus and an internal portion of a linear mitochondrial plasmid of Agaricus bitorquis\u201d Curr Genet. 1991. 19:495-502).",
                        "In the case of A. bisporus, the main obstacle to effective breeding strategies is the rather abnormal life cycle involving the unusual simultaneous segregation of either parental nucleus into one basidiospore. After outgrowth of this basidiospore, heterokaryotic mycelium is formed containing nuclei and genetic characteristics that do not differ from those present in the parental mycelium. In addition, only little recombinational activity is observed during meiosis (Summerbell et al. Genetics, October 123(2) 1989 pp. 293-300).",
                        "To overcome the limitations of conventional breeding, investigators all over the world have attempted to develop and improve transformation methods for commercial mushrooms, such as A. bisporus, for the introduction of novel characteristics. For other fungi, as well as plants, animals, and bacteria, the application of gene transfer technology is quite common and has already resulted in commercial application.",
                        "In order to enhance the economies of protein production in microorganisms, such as fungi, there have been substantial efforts to improve the efficiency of transcription and translation, maximize the proportion of total protein directed to production of the desired product, enhance the viability of the modified host, and improve the efficiency with which the modified host may be obtained. The primary promoter used in fungal transformation to date is the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter. Using strong promoters to express heterologous genes in appropriate hosts is a major strategy in biotechnological applications. The gpd promoter is a strong promoter that can be induced by any carbon source and has been widely used in the expression of heterologous proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris and other yeasts.",
                        "The gpd genes have also been cloned from basidiomycetous fungi, including Schizophyllum commune, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Agaricus bisporus (Harmsen et al., 1992), and Lentinula edodes (Hirano et al., 1999). Among these mushrooms, genetic transformation using homologous gpd promoter was reported to be successful only in A. bisporus, Flammulina velutipes and L. edodes (Hirano et al., 2000, Kuo et al., 2004, van de Rhee et al., 1996). Although heterologous promoters have been used for the expression of drug-resistant marker genes, the genetic transformation is not sufficient to express heterologous genes (Ruiz-Diez, 2002). To sufficiently and effectively express a heterologous gene, it is important for a host cell to recognize the promoter sequence by its transcriptional machinery. Chun-Yi Kuo et al. demonstrated that a heterologous gene, hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (hpt), can be expressed in F. velutipes (Kuo et al., 2004). However, it was found that although the gpd genes in basidiomycetous fungi are highly similar, these gene differ significantly in their promoter regions.",
                        "As illustrated by the foregoing, there is a continuing need in the art for development of effective, convenient, and expeditious fungal transformation systems and gene expression components.",
                        "It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a transformation system and in particular a strong regulatory element for fungi that will accomplish the foregoing need.",
                        "A further object of this invention is to provide mechanisms for application of transgenic techniques such as those applied to bacteria, non-filamentous fungi (yeast), plants, and animals to increase yield, disease, and pest resistance, product quality, shelf life, or culinary, nutritional, or medicinal value, to produce heterologous proteins commercially, or other such protocols.",
                        "It is yet another object of the invention to provide regulatory elements capable of driving high level protein accumulation of operably linked sequences in the fruit body of fungi, as well as tissues in plant, or animal cells.",
                        "It is yet another object of the invention to provide regulatory elements polynucleotide constructs, vectors, and transformed cells for use in such transgenic protocols.",

The invention is further to methods of using the sequence in plants, fungi, and bacterial tissues and their cells.",
                        "A method for expressing an isolated nucleotide sequence in a fungus using the regulatory sequences disclosed herein is provided. The method comprises transforming a fungal cell with a transformation vector that comprises an isolated nucleotide sequence operably linked to one or more of the regulatory sequences of the present invention and regenerating a stably transformed fungus from the transformed fungal cell. In this manner, the regulatory sequences are useful for controlling the expression of endogenous as well as exogenous products in a fruiting body tissue.",
                        "Alternatively, it might be desirable to inhibit expression of a native DNA sequence within the tissues of a fungus to achieve a desired phenotype. In this case, such inhibition might be accomplished, for example, with transformation of a fungus to comprise the promoter operably linked to an antisense nucleotide sequence, hairpin, RNA interfering or other nucleic acid molecule, such that expression of the molecule interferes with translation of the mRNA of the native DNA sequence or otherwise inhibits expression of same in a subset of the cells of the fungus.",
                        "Under the regulation of the regulatory element will be a sequence of interest, which will provide for modification of the phenotype of a fungus. Such modification includes modulating the production of an endogenous product, as to amount, relative distribution, or the like, or production of an exogenous expression product to provide for a novel function or product in a fungus. Such a promoter is useful for a variety of applications, such as production of transgenic fungi with desired traits, including, for example, altered content, protein quality, cell growth or nutrient quality or preferably for the production of heterologous proteins.",
                        "By \u201cfruiting body tissue\u201d promoter is intended expression that is capable of transcribing an operatively linked nucleotide sequence efficiently and thereby achieving accumulation of a protein or nucleotide sequence of interest at high levels in the described tissues, here the fruiting body tissue cells. Tissue can refer to a cell of a particular tissue.",
                        "By \u201cregulatory element\u201d is intended sequences responsible for expression of the linked nucleic acid molecule including, but not limited to, promoters, terminators, enhancers, introns, and the like.",
                        "By \u201cpromoter\u201d is intended a regulatory region of DNA capable of regulating the transcription of a sequence linked thereto. It usually comprises a TATA box capable of directing RNA polymerase II to initiate RNA synthesis at the appropriate transcription initiation site for a particular coding sequence.",
                        "A promoter may additionally comprise other recognition sequences generally positioned upstream or 5\u2032 to the TATA box, referred to as upstream promoter elements, which influence the transcription initiation rate and further include elements that impact spatial and temporal expression of the linked nucleotide sequence. It is recognized that having identified the nucleotide sequences for the promoter region disclosed herein, it is within the state of the art to isolate and identify further regulatory elements in the 5\u2032 region upstream from the particular promoter region. Thus the promoter region disclosed here may comprise upstream regulatory elements such as those responsible for tissue and temporal expression of the nucleic acid molecule, and may include enhancers, the DNA response element for a transcriptional regulatory protein, ribosomal binding sites, transcriptional start and stop sequences, translational start and stop sequences, activator sequence and the like.",
                        "In the same manner, the promoter elements that enable such expression can be identified, isolated, and used with other core promoters to confirm expression in fruiting body tissue. By core promoter is meant the minimal sequence required to initiate transcription, such as the sequence called the TATA box, which is common to promoters in genes encoding proteins. Thus the upstream promoter of SB-LEG can optionally be used in conjunction with its own or core promoters from other sources. The promoter may be native or non-native to the cell in which it is found.",
                        "The isolated promoter sequence of the present invention can be modified to provide for a range of expression levels of the isolated nucleotide sequence. Less than the entire promoter region can be utilized and the ability to achieve expression in the fruit body tissue retained. It is recognized that expression levels of mRNA can be modulated with specific deletions of portions of the promoter sequence. Thus, the promoter can be modified to be a weak or strong promoter. Generally, by \u201cweak promoter\u201d is intended a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence at a low level. By \u201clow level\u201d is intended levels of about 1/10,000 transcripts to about 1/100,000 transcripts to about 1/500,000 transcripts. Conversely, a strong promoter drives expression of a coding sequence at a high level, or at about 1/10 transcripts to about 1/100 transcripts to about 1/1,000 transcripts. Generally, at least about 20 nucleotides of an isolated promoter sequence will be used to drive expression of a nucleotide sequence.",
                        "It is recognized that to increase transcription levels enhancers can be utilized in combination with the promoter regions of the invention. Enhancers are nucleotide sequences that act to increase the expression of a promoter region. Enhancers are known in the art and include the SV40 enhancer region, the 35S enhancer element, and the like.",
                        "The promoter of the present invention can be isolated from the 5\u2032 region of its native coding region or 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR). Likewise the terminator can be isolated from the 3\u2032 region flanking its respective stop codon.",

Methods for isolation of promoter regions are well known in the art. One method is the use of primers and genomic DNA used in conjunction with the Genome Walker Kit\u2122 (Clonetech).",

The minimal core promoter is 45 nucleotides in length, with the full-length promoter being approximately 135 to 180 nucleotides in length. 160 is 818 base pair nucleotides in length. The lectin promoter was isolated from the A. bisporus lectin coding region.",
                        "The regulatory regions of the invention may be isolated from any plant animal or fungi, but is preferably filamentous fungi, including, but not limited to the fungi of the genera Flammulina, Agaricus, Lentinula, and Pleurotus. Promoters isolated from one fungal species can be expected to express in another fungal species.",

In these techniques, all or part of the known coding sequence is used as a probe that selectively hybridizes to other sequences present in a population of cloned genomic DNA fragments (i.e. genomic libraries) from a chosen organism. Methods are readily available in the art for the hybridization of nucleic acid sequences. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology-Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2 \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assays\u201d, Elsevier, New York (1993); and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 2, Ausubel et al., Eds., Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York (1995).",

                        "As used herein, a \u201cfunctional fragment\u201d is a regulatory sequence variant formed by one or more deletions from a larger regulatory element. For example, the 5\u2032 portion of a promoter up to the TATA box near the transcription start site can be deleted without abolishing promoter activity, as described by Opsahl-Sorteberg et al., \u201cIdentification of a 49-bp fragment of the HvLTP2 promoter directing aleurone cell specific expression\u201d Gene 341:49-58 (2004). Such fragments should retain promoter activity, particularly the ability to drive expression in the select tissue. Activity can be measured by Northern blot analysis, reporter activity measurements when using transcriptional fusions, and the like. See, for example, Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).",

                        "For example, a routine way to remove part of a DNA sequence is to use an exonuclease in combination with DNA amplification to produce unidirectional nested deletions of double stranded DNA clones. A commercial kit for this purpose is sold under the trade name Exo-Size\u2122 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). Briefly, this procedure entails incubating exonuclease III with DNA to progressively remove nucleotides in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction at 5\u2032 overhangs, blunt ends or nicks in the DNA template. However, exonuclease III is unable to remove nucleotides at 3\u2032, 4-base overhangs. Timed digests of a clone with this enzyme produces unidirectional nested deletions.",
                        "The entire promoter sequence or portions thereof can be used as a probe capable of specifically hybridizing to corresponding promoter sequences. To achieve specific hybridization under a variety of conditions, such probes include sequences that are unique and are preferably at least about 10 nucleotides in length, and most preferably at least about 20 nucleotides in length. Such probes can be used to amplify corresponding promoter sequences from a chosen organism by the well-known process of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This technique can be used to isolate additional promoter sequences from a desired organism or as a diagnostic assay to determine the presence of the promoter sequence in an organism. Examples include hybridization screening of plated DNA libraries (either plaques or colonies; see e.g. Innis et al. (1990) PCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, eds., Academic Press). Primers used in isolating the promoter of the present invention are shown below.",
                        "In referring to a terminator sequence is meant a nucleotide sequence that functions as a polyadenylation signal and signals the end of transcription. Functional fragments that retain such activity are within the scope of the invention.",

The term \u201cnucleotide sequence of interest\u201d refers to a nucleic acid molecule (which may also be referred to as a polynucleotide) which can be an RNA molecule as well as DNA molecule, and can be a molecule that encodes for a desired polypeptide or protein, but also may refer to nucleic acid molecules that do not constitute an entire gene, and which do not necessarily encode a polypeptide or protein. For example, when used in a homologous recombination process, the promoter may be placed in a construct with a sequence that targets an area of the chromosome in the fungi but may not encode a protein. If desired, the nucleotide sequence of interest can be optimized for fungi translation by optimizing the codons used for fungi and the sequence around the translational start site for fungi. Sequences resulting in potential mRNA instability can also be avoided.",
                        "The regulatory elements of the invention can be operably linked in expression cassettes along with isolated nucleotide sequences of interest for expression in the desired fungi or plant or animal. Such an expression cassette is provided with a plurality of restriction sites for insertion of the nucleotide sequence of interest under the transcriptional control of the regulatory elements. Alternatively, a specific result can be achieved by providing for a reduction of expression of one or more endogenous products, particularly enzymes or cofactors in fungi. This down regulation can be achieved through many different approaches known to one skilled in the art, including antisense, co-suppression, use of hairpin formations, or others, and discussed infra. Importation or exportation of a cofactor also allows for control of composition. It is recognized that the regulatory elements may be used with their native or other coding sequences to increase or decrease expression of an operably linked sequence in the transformed fungi, plant, seed or animal cell.",

More specific categories of transgenes include genes encoding important traits for agronomics, insect resistance, disease resistance, herbicide resistance, and other characteristics. Still other categories of transgenes include genes for inducing expression of exogenous products such as enzymes, cofactors, and hormones. Still others include those encoding an antibody, a secondary metabolite, a therapeutic compound, a biological macromolecule, a medical enzyme; or a gene that confers or contributes to a value-added trait. Examples include a secondary metabolite such as lectin, a therapeutic compound such as a vaccine, a biological macromolecule such as an interferon, endostatin or insulin, a medical enzyme such as a thrombolytic or cerebrosidase and a gene that confers resistance to pests, diseases, or herbicides such as a pesticidal compound Bacillus thuringiensis protein (Bt toxin).",

By \u201cantisense DNA nucleotide sequence\u201d is intended a sequence that is in inverse orientation to the 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 normal orientation of that nucleotide sequence. When delivered into a cell, expression of the antisense DNA sequence prevents normal expression of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. The antisense nucleotide sequence encodes an RNA transcript that is complementary to and capable of hybridizing with the endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. In this case, production of the native protein encoded by the targeted gene is inhibited to achieve a desired phenotypic response. Thus the regulatory sequences disclosed herein can be operably linked to antisense DNA sequences to reduce or inhibit expression of a native protein in fungi.",
                        "As noted, other potential approaches to impact expression of proteins in the fungi include traditional co-suppression, that is, inhibition of expression of an endogenous gene through the expression of an identical structural gene or gene fragment introduced through transformation (Goring, D. R., Thomson, L., Rothstein, S. J. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1770-1774 co-suppression; Taylor (1997) Plant Cell 9:1245; Jorgensen (1990) Trends Biotech. 8(12):340-344; Flavell (1994) PNAS USA 91:3490-3496; Finnegan et al. (1994) Bio/Technology 12:883-888; and Neuhuber et al. (1994) Mol. Gen. Genet. 244:230-241)). In one example, co-suppression can be achieved by linking the promoter to a DNA segment such that transcripts of the segment are produced in the sense orientation and where the transcripts have at least 65% sequence identity to transcripts of the endogenous gene of interest, thereby suppressing expression of the endogenous gene in said fungal cell. (See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,283,184). The endogenous gene targeted for co-suppression may be a gene encoding any protein that accumulates in the fungal species of interest.",

The miRNA gene encodes an RNA that forms a hairpin structure containing a 22-nucleotide sequence that is complementary to another endogenous gene (target sequence). miRNA molecules are highly efficient at inhibiting the expression of endogenous genes, and the RNA interference they induce is inherited by subsequent generations of fungi.",

In one embodiment, the fungal selection marker and the gene of interest can be both functionally linked to the same promoter. In another embodiment, the selection marker and the gene of interest can be functionally linked to different promoters. In yet other embodiments, the expression vector can contain two or more genes of interest that can be linked to the same promoter or different promoters. For example, the SB-LEG promoter described here can be used to drive the gene of interest and the selectable marker, or a different promoter used for one or the other. These other promoter elements can be those that are constitutive or sufficient to render promoter-dependent gene expression controllable as being cell-type specific, tissue-specific or time or developmental stage specific, or being inducible by external signals or agents. Such elements may be located in the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 regions of the gene. Although the additional promoter may be the endogenous promoter of a structural gene of interest, the promoter can also be a foreign regulatory sequence.

Reaction mixtures were vortexed and subjected to a second PCR program consisting of one cycle at 94\u00b0 C. for 2 min followed by 1 cycle at 94\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, 25\u00b0 C. for 10 sec, ramp to 65\u00b0 C. at 0.1\u00b0 C./sec, 68\u00b0 C. for 6 min, then 20 cycles of 94\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, 55\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, 68\u00b0 C. for 2 min and 50 sec, and a final cycle at 68\u00b0 C. for 30 min. Following the secondary PCR amplification, 0.5 \u03bcl of the PCR product from A, B, C and D tubes was transferred to tubes labeled A1, B1, C1, and D1, respectively. A 1 \u03bcl aliquot of 10\u00d7DRT primer digestion buffer was added to each tube with 0.5 \u03bcl of digestion enzyme mix, and 8 \u03bcl of water. The digestion mixtures were vortexed and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 min. The enzyme in the digestion mixtures was then heat-inactivated at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min. Following the digestion reactions the 5\u2032 genomic DNA region upstream of the lectin gene was amplified by nested PCR. For nested PCR, 15 \u03bcl of reaction mixture were added to each of four tubes labeled A2, B2, C2, and D2, using 3\u00d7APAgene\u2122 Gold buffer I for tubes A2 and B2, and APAgene\u2122 Gold buffer II for tubes C2 and D2. The 15 \u03bcl of reaction mixture for the nested PCR contained 5 \u03bcl of 3\u00d7APAgene\u2122 Gold buffer (I or II), 0.3 \u03bcl of 50\u00d7PCR annealing enhancer, 0.3 \u03bcl of 40 mM dNTPs, 0.4 \u03bcl of 20 pmol/\u03bcl of lectin-F2 primer, 0.4 \u03bcl of Universal Tagging Primer, 0.5 \u03bcl of digested PCR product from tubes A1, B1, C1, or D1, and 0.3 \u03bcl of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 7.8 \u03bcl of water. The nested PCR program for amplification of the putative lectin genes consisted of one cycle at 94\u00b0 C. for 4 min followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0 C. for 30 sec, 62\u00b0 C. for 10 sec, ramp to 65\u00b0 C. at 0.1\u00b0 C./sec, followed by 68\u00b0 C. for 2 min and 30 sec and a final cycle at 68\u00b0 C. for 10 min. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel in 1\u00d7TBE (1\u00d7TRIS/BORATE/EDTA, 54 g of Tris base, 27.5 g of boric acid, 20 ml of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) in 1000 ml) by gel electrophoresis. The PCR products of reactions A2, C2 and D2 ranged in size from \u02dc400 bp to \u02dc600 bp. Amplicons were recovered from the agarose gel using a Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Invitrogen).",
                                "The PCR amplification products of the putative 5\u2032 genomic DNA regions upstream of the lectin genes were cloned into a pCR2.1 TOPO vector using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 4 \u03bcl of PCR product recovered from the agarose gel was added to 6 \u03bcl of pCR2.1 ligation reaction. After ligation for 5 min at room temperature, 3 \u03bcl of each reaction mixture were used to transform ONE-SHOT DH5\u03b1 chemical competent cells (Invitrogen). The transformed cells were plated and selected on LB (Growcells, Irvine, Calif.) agar plate containing 50 \u03bcg/ml of kanamycin with 40 \u03bcl of 40 mg/ml of X-gal (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio) spread on the surface. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in the dark, white colonies were picked for plasmid DNA preparation. Plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI and separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1\u00d7TBE (described above) to identify clones with the correct insert sizes. The clones containing PCR product from the A2 reaction were designated pAGN-743, those from the C2 reaction as pAGN-744 and those from D2 as pAGN-745.",
                                "The nucleotide sequence of the lectin gene promoter was determined by sequencing the inserts in pAGN-743, pAGN-744 and pAGN745 using an M13R-reverse primer. Alignment among the insert sequences of pAGN-743, pAGN-744 and pAGN-745 clones revealed that the three PCR products overlapped. pAGN745 clones (pAGN-745-1, -2 and -3) contained the longest 5\u2032 genomic DNA region upstream of the lectin gene. The consensus sequence of the 5\u2032 genomic DNA region upstream of the lectin gene was generated using sequence information from pAGN-745 clones. The overlap of the consensus sequence with the 5\u2032 end cDNA sequence of lectin gene confirmed that the DNA fragment generated by genome walking represented the promoter region of the lectin gene. Alignment between the genomic DNA sequence generated by genome walking and the lectin cDNA sequence (U14936, Crenshaw et al. 1996) revealed an intron in the 5\u2032 UTR of lectin mRNA. A nucleotide blast search (blastn) of the consensus sequence of the 5\u2032 genomic DNA region upstream of the lectin gene against \u201call GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB sequences\u201d failed to show identity with any known sequences, indicating that the isolated sequence was a novel promoter.",

                                "Binary vector pAGN-750 (FIG. 2) was constructed to test the ability of the lectin promoter (designated as pLctn) to drive the expression of a \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in A. bisporus. pLctn was amplified from pAGN-745 using primers Lctn-BglII (5\u2032-AGCTTAGATCTGAACACGCG TCGTTTACCTCC-3\u2032) and Lctn-NcoI (5\u2032-GTAAGTCCATGGTCTGCTCAACGTTATGAG TTAGTTG-3\u2032). Restriction enzyme sites, BglII and NcoI, were incorporated into primers to facilitate cloning. The PCR product was digested with BglII/NcoI and the digested product was used to replace the BglII-NcoI fragment in GUS expression vector pAGN-030 to create pAGN-750. The pLctn sequence in pAGN-750 was confirmed by sequencing. pAGN-750 was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and then A. bisporus following the transformation procedure described by Chen et al. (2000). Transgenic events generated from pAGN-750 were analyzed for GUS expression (GUS protocol by Sean R. Gallagher, 1991) in the vegetative mycelium and reproductive fruiting body. For determining GUS expression in the mycelium, mycelium of transgenic events was allowed to colonize filter paper for 10-14 days on SM agar plate containing 30 \u03bcg/ml of hygromycin B. GUS expression in mycelium was evaluated based on the intensity of blue color present in the mycelial colony exposed to staining buffer on filter paper (FIG. 3). The results of this study showed that pLctn drove GUS expression in the vegetative growth stage of A. bisporus. GUS expression in fruit tissue was also evaluated. Mycelia of transgenic events were used to inoculate growth media for mushroom production. Following transformation and selection of transgenic lines on hygromycin, cultures were transferred to liquid media (2% malt extract broth (Difco) and maintained there at room temperature pending inoculation of fruiting media. The liquid media culture was mixed with a sterilized rye/millet grain mixture (50:50) in sterilized 250 ml plastic containers and the transgenic A. bisporus mycelia was allowed to colonize the grain substrate for approximately two weeks at room temperature. The fully colonized grain was overlaid with a three cm depth of peat humus casing mixture and the cultures were transferred to 18\u00b0 C. incubators when mycelium emerged on the top of casing. Cultures were watered frequently to maintain the moist growing environment preferred by the organism. Mature fruit was harvested prior to sporulation and either placed immediately at \u221280\u00b0 C. for storage and future analysis or for gus expressing lines, stored briefly at 4\u00b0 C. prior to analysis by GUS visual staining or the MUG quantitative assay.",
                                "For visualization of gus gene expression, 3-mm thick slice from each fruiting body was submerged in GUS staining buffer. GUS expression in fruiting bodies was recorded according to a visual estimation of the intensity of color development in the tissues (Table 1). The findings of this study (Table 1, FIG. 3) showed that pLctn can direct high-level GUS accumulation in the reproductive fruiting body of A. bisporus. Variation in the levels of staining intensity among different independent transgenic events was observed for the pAGN-750 construct. This variation can be explained by differences in sequence context resulting from integration of the transgene into different chromosomal locations and/or by differences in transgene copy number between events, which is commonly observed for other promoter/transgene combinations transformed into A. bisporus and routinely reported in other plant, animal and fungal systems (Peach C. and Velten J. 1991; Siegal M. L. and Hartl D. L. 1998; Butaye et al. 2005). Fruiting bodies from five events were chosen to quantitatively measure GUS activity using the MUG (4-Methylumbelliferyl glucuronide) assay (Gallagher, S. R. 1991). To extract total soluble protein for the MUG assay, 100 mg of fruiting body tissue were added to a tube containing 300 ul of PBS buffer (1\u00d7PBS: 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.44 g Na2HPO4 and 0.24 g KH2PO4 in 1000 ml, pH 7.4) with 3 glass beads (3.5 mm in diameter) and homogenized at 400 strikes/min for 3 min with Geno/Grinder (SPEX SamplePrep 2000 Geno/Grinder, SPEX SamplePrep LLC, Metuchen, N.J.). Protein concentration in the soluble extract was quantified following the manufacturer's instruction for the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermos Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). Quantification of GUS activity in fruiting body tissue is presented as MUG reading per \u03bcg of total soluble protein extracted from the tissues. The MUG assay data (Table 2) confirmed the results of the qualitative analysis of GUS expression in the fruiting body. The results are shown in FIG. 3.",
