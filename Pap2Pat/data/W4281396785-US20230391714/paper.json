    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a critical public health problem with a lifetime prevalence of nearly 17% in the United States. One potential therapeutic target is the interaction between hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and an auxiliary subunit of the channel named tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b). HCN channels regulate neuronal excitability in the mammalian hippocampus, and recent work has established that antagonizing HCN function rescues cognitive impairment caused by chronic stress. Here, we utilize a high-throughput virtual screen to find small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction. We found that the hit compound NUCC-0200590 disrupts the TRIP8b-HCN interaction in vitro and in vivo. These results provide a compelling strategy for developing new small molecules capable of disrupting the TRIP8b-HCN interaction.",

The curated dataset was then subjected to the LigPrep module of Schr\u00f6dinger in OPLS3 force field at pH 7.4\u00a0\u00b1 1 retaining the specific chirality to produce a low energetic 3D structure for each molecule.",
                        "The protein preparation engine implemented in the Schr\u00f6dinger software suite was utilized to prepare the TRIP8b protein for small molecule\u2013docking simulations. Analysis of the atomic structure of TRIP8b (Protein Data Bank code 4EQF), which is complexed with an HCN2 carboxy-terminus peptide, showed that the critical interactions between the peptide and TRIP8b included the E67, N99, R236, N205, R206, N213, and N240 residues of TRIP8b (24). The Prime protein energy minimization module implemented in the Schr\u00f6dinger suite was used to correct irrelevant side chains, add missing atoms, eliminate partial occupant rotamers, fix the undesired orientation of Asn, Gln, and His residues, and replace the \u201cb\u201d values by the optimized potential for liquid simulation (OPLS3) charges.

We selected the 77 compounds with a Glide docking score\u00a0<\u00a0\u22126.0. We then used an orthogonal docking engine (Surflex) implemented in the Sybyl interface of Tripos (35) to obtain consensus binding poses and to enrich the hit rate using alternative flexible ligand-docking tools (36). We found 52 compounds that showed similar binding poses with comparable binding scores by comparing the binding poses and scores obtained from both docking experiments.

Alkylation of commercially available 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (1) with ethyl bromoacetate (2) afforded acetate 3 in quantitative yield. Reductive amination with N-methyl piperazine afforded four, which was hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid 5 under basic condition. Amide coupling of acid 5 with (4-chlorophenyl)methanamine using hydroxybenzotriazole and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide was not successful, so alternative approaches were explored. Though several early transition-metal complexes, especially from zirconium and titanium, have been used as catalysts in direct coupling of deactivated acids in high yields, the conversion was very low in our case. Conversion of the acid to an acid chloride before amidation was successful albeit with low yield. A larger set of coupling reagents were screened and O-(N-Succinimidyl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate was identified as the best coupling reagent and produced the acetamide 6 in 66% yield. Suzuki coupling with (4-fluorophenyl)boronic acid afforded the final compound NUCC-0200590 in excellent yield. Conversion to the formic acid (FA) salt was achieved by exposure to the FA modifier in prep HPLC purification or to the hydrochloric acid (HCl) salt by treating the free base with 4M HCl in dioxane."

                        "We sought to validate the binding of NUCC-0200590 to TRIP8b using other biophysical assays. The free base of NUCC-0200590 has low solubility in PBS, which limits our ability to evaluate the binding to TRIP8b using other biophysical assays, such as saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR. To improve the aqueous solubility, we synthesized and characterized two salt forms of NUCC-0200590. The FA salt form was recovered after reverse-phase preparative HPLC while using 0.1% FA as a mobile phase modifier. Though the FA salt form had better aqueous solubility than the free base, it still required 15% dimethyl sufoxide (DMSO) in PBS to observe visible proton signals in 1H-NMR. On stirring the free amine in 4M HCl in dioxane, the compound was converted to the HCl salt as a white solid (Scheme S1). Comparison of the thermodynamic solubility of the three forms (free amine, FA salt, and HCl salt) of NUCC-0200590 performed with an in-house protocol (37) showed that the free amine had negligible solubility in PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature (RT) after stirring for 16\u00a0h. The FA salt showed much improved solubility (45\u00a0\u03bcM) in PBS at pH 7.4 and even greater solubility (252\u00a0\u03bcM) was shown for the HCl salt. As a result, the HCl salt of NUCC-0200590 was used for biophysical assays."

                        "To validate and gain structural understanding of the binding mode of NUCC-0200590 to TRIP8b, we performed STD-NMR experiments on the compound in the presence of TRIP8b. STD-NMR is a popular ligand-observed NMR technique used in studying protein\u2013ligand interactions of weak affinity ligands (high nanomolar to low nanomolar) range. It is a robust technique because it relies on the measurement of relatively simple 1H-NMR signals of the ligand instead of the complex protein spectrum. This technique is based on the transfer of saturation from the protein to the bound ligand when the protein is selectively irradiated at a frequency where only resonances from the protein are located. The fast exchange of ligands with the binding sites allows for identification of the epitope of the protein surface close to the bound ligand. The STD-NMR of NUCC-0200590 bound to TRIP8b was initially carried out using a 20-fold ligand excess with respect to the protein at on-resonance frequency of\u00a0\u22121\u00a0ppm and off-resonance frequency of 40\u00a0ppm. To better define the binding epitope, a 100-fold ligand excess was used (20\u00a0\u03bcM protein:2\u00a0mM ligand) in the STD-NMR experiment (Fig.\u00a02). The reference 1H-NMR spectrum of 2\u00a0mM ligand in deuterated PBS at pH 7.4 showed the entire proton signals of the ligand (Fig.\u00a02A). On irradiating a solution of NUCC-0200590 (2\u00a0mM) and TRIP8b (20\u00a0\u03bcM) at the on-resonance and off-resonance frequency, there was unambiguous evidence of saturation transfer to the ligand as shown by the STD-NMR (Fig.\u00a02B). A control STD-NMR experiment of the ligand without the protein showed no ligand signal as there was no saturation transfer occurring due to the absence of TRIP8b (Fig.\u00a02C). This confirmed the ability of NUCC0200590 to bind directly to TRIP8b. To get a structural understanding of the binding mode, the relative degree of saturation of the protons in the ligand was analyzed. Integration of the STD-NMR protons normalized to the protons at 7.65\u00a0ppm shows the aromatic protons with a 1:1 integral ratio in both the reference spectrum and the STD-NMR spectrum, which indicates that these protons are in close proximity to the protein. In comparison, integration of the aliphatic protons displayed integral ratio from 2:1 to 13:1 (reference spectrum: STD-NMR spectrum). This suggests that these protons were further away from the protein surface in comparison to the aromatic protons. Interestingly, the aliphatic protons of the piperazine showed no saturation transfer as they were not visible in the STD-NMR, indicating that they are not close to the binding pocket of TRIP8b, which agrees with the docked pose of NUCC-0200590 that shows this portion oriented toward the solvent. However, the methyl group on the piperazine showed significant evidence of saturation transfer, suggesting that the methyl group is near the protein surface possibly due to its angle of projection from the piperazine (Fig.\u00a02D). Furthermore, the inhibitor was screened for in\u00a0vitro stability toward mouse liver microsomes to evaluate its potential metabolism and suitability for future in\u00a0vivo experiments. The microsomal stability was measured after a 60 min incubation at 37 \u00b0C with mouse liver microsomes. NUCC-0200590 was rapidly metabolized by mouse liver microsomes as only 3.7 % of the parent compound remained after incubation.Figure\u00a02Saturation-transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) spectroscopy of NUCC-0200590 bound to TRIP8b.A, 1H-NMR reference spectrum of NUCC-0200590 in deuterated PBS.

                        "We next turned our attention to testing the ability of NUCC-0200590 to disrupt the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction in cell-based assays (using the free base version of the compound for the remainder of the paper). There are many isoforms of TRIP8b that differ in terms of the N-terminal exons that are included (with each isoform named by which exons are included (30)). As an exemplary TRIP8b isoform, we exclusively used the TRIP8b(1a-4) isoform, which is thought to be the most commonly occurring isoform in the brain (30). Thus, \u201cTRIP8b\u201d specifically refers to \u201cTRIP8b (1a-4).\u201d Similarly, although HCN1 and HCN2 have slightly different electrophysiological properties in\u00a0vitro (9, 38), both are thought to bind to TRIP8b in precisely the same manner (30) and have a similar shift in their V50 when bound by TRIP8b. As such, we alternate between the two HCN isoforms (as outlined in the text) to confirm our results for both subunits in the experiments later. Thus, the phrase \u201cHCN channels\u201d refers to HCN1 and HCN2 channels collectively.",
                        "Having validated NUCC-0200590 as an inhibitor of the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction in biophysical and biochemical assays, we tested its effects in several cellular assays. We first examined potential cytotoxicity by incubating HEK293T cells for 3\u00a0h or 24\u00a0h and analyzing cell viability. No cell death was observed after 3\u00a0h of incubation at all tested concentrations of NUCC-0200590 (data not shown). However, after 24\u00a0h incubation, at 25\u00a0\u03bcM and above, we noted cell death, but at lower concentrations there was no effect observed for NUCC-0200590 on cell viability (Fig.\u00a03A). To study the ability of NUCC-0200590 to disrupt the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction using full-length proteins, we first employed a NanoBiT split luciferase assay using full-length HCN1 and TRIP8b fused to the relevant Nanoluciferase protein fragments (referred to as SmBiT-HCN1 and LgBiT-TRIP8, see Experimental procedures). Briefly, the interaction of SmBiT-HCN1 with LgBiT-TRIP8b in live cells promotes assembly of functional luciferase through the proximity of the SmBiT and LgBiT fusion fragments, leading to the production of a luminescent signal in proportion to the amount of HCN1\u2013TRIP8b binding (Fig.\u00a03B). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with SmBiT-HCN1 and LgBiT-TRIP8b constructs, then pretreated for 30\u00a0min with varying concentrations of NUCC-0200590 before adding substrate and reading the luminescent signal. Increasing concentrations of NUCC-0200590 led to a reduction in HCN1\u2013TRIP8b binding as indicated by normalized luminescence, with an IC50 of 5.62\u00a0\u00b1 0.49\u00a0\u03bcM. To ensure the inhibition was specific, we also examined the interaction of the positive control pair protein kinase A catalytic (PRKACA) with type 2A regulatory subunit (PRKAR2A). In the presence of similar concentrations of NUCC-0200590, no change in the binding of these two proteins was observed (Fig.\u00a03B), consistent with a specific effect of NUCC-0200590 on the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction.Figure\u00a03Cellular toxicity of NUCC-0200590 and NanoBit assay confirming the ability of NUCC-0200590 disrupting the interaction in cells.A, HEK293T cells were incubated with varying concentrations of NUCC-0200590 (0\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h and then the viability assayed with a commercially available assay (see Experimental procedures).

                        "To test whether the inhibition of TRIP8b\u2013HCN binding by NUCC-0200590 influences HCN channel function, we performed whole-cell recordings using HEK293\u00a0cells stably expressing HCN2 (22). In these experiments, we were specifically interested in monitoring the two distinct effects of TRIP8b on HCN channel function as we reasoned that it may provide insight into the effect of NUCC-0200590. First, TRIP8b binding to HCN hyperpolarizes the V50 of Ih by \u223c10\u00a0mV (22, 25, 29), indicating that a more hyperpolarized potential is needed to open the channel. Second, TRIP8b binding to HCN increases the surface expression of the channel so that there are more HCN channels present at the cell surface (greater Ih current density) (22, 25, 29). HEK293 cells stably expressing HCN2 (22) were transfected with either GFP and an empty vector or GFP and TRIP8b (Fig.\u00a04 A-D). Twenty-four\u00a0hours after transfection, the extracellular media was exchanged for media containing between 0\u00a0\u03bcM and 10\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 (well below the toxic levels noted previously). After 24\u00a0h, whole-cell recordings were performed from GFP expressing cells. We first examined the V50 of Ih and observed a hyperpolarization of the V50 when HCN was coexpressed with TRIP8b (identical to prior work (22, 25, 29), Figure\u00a04E). However, in the presence of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM (and higher concentrations) of NUCC-0200590, there was no difference in the V50 between the TRIP8b condition and the control condition (Fig.\u00a04E). Combined, these results indicate that NUCC-0200590 disrupts the hyperpolarizing effect of TRIP8b on the V50 of HCN channels and suggests that NUCC-0200590 causes TRIP8b to dissociate from HCN channels.Figure\u00a04NUCC-0200590 disrupts TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel regulation in HEK cells.A\u2013D, representative whole-cell recordings were made from HEK cells stably expressing HCN2 and transiently transfected with an empty plasmid (A and B) or TRIP8b (C and D). Cells were also incubated for 24\u00a0h with NUCC-0200590 (B and D). E, the V50 of Ih was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of NUCC-0200590 after incubation for 24\u00a0h. Note that the y-axis is negative such that more hyperpolarized values are higher up on the plot compared with less hyperpolarized values. At 0\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590, TRIP8b transfection hyperpolarized the V50 of Ih as has previously been shown. In the presence of NUCC-0200590, there was no effect of TRIP8b on the V50 of Ih. two-way ANOVA of V50 with factors transfection (empty plasmid, TRIP8b) and drug concentration (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) showed no effect of transfection (F(1,147)\u00a0= 1.27, p\u00a0= 0.26) but an effect of drug (F(4,147)\u00a0= 6.78, p\u00a0= 0.0000485) and an interaction between the two conditions (F(4,147)\u00a0= 5.34, p\u00a0= 0.00047). Planned post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (p\u00a0< 0.01 significant) revealed a difference between the two transfection conditions only at 0\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(78)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.9361, p\u00a0= 0.000004) but not at other drug concentrations 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(17)\u00a0= 0.50, p\u00a0= 0.62), 5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(18)\u00a0= 1.31, p\u00a0= 0.20), 7.5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(17)\u00a0= 1.10, p\u00a0= 0.28), or 10\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(17)\u00a0= 0.96, p\u00a0= 0.34).

F, transfection with TRIP8b increased the surface expression of HCN channels and led to a higher density of Ih, consistent with prior reports. However, increasing concentrations of NUCC-0200590 led to less current density of Ih, indicating disruption of the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction. Two-way ANOVA of current density with factors transfection (empty plasmid, TRIP8b(1a-4)) and drug concentration (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) showed an effect of transfection (F(1,148)\u00a0= 90.76, p\u00a0= 4.4712E-17), an effect of drug (F(4,148)\u00a0= 7.74, p\u00a0= 0.00001), and an interaction between the two (F(4,148)\u00a0= 7.06, p\u00a0= 0.00003). Planned post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction (p\u00a0< 0.01 significant) revealed a difference between the two transfection conditions at 0 to 5\u00a0M drug concentrations 0\u00a0\u03bcM (t(78)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221213.41, p= 5.9243E-22), 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM (t(17)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.29, p\u00a0= 0.0004), 5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(18)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.12, p\u00a0= 0.0006), 7.5\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(17)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.541, p\u00a0= 0.021), or 10\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0(t(17)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.56, p\u00a0= 0.019). For the HCN alone condition n\u00a0= 26, 6, 6, 6, and 6\u00a0cells were used for the 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations, respectively, while for the HCN\u00a0+ TRIP8b condition n\u00a0= 54, 13, 14, 13, 14\u00a0cells were used. G, flow cytometry confirms that NUCC-0200590 disrupts TRIP8b-mediated HCN1 surface trafficking. Two-way ANOVA of surface HCN1 expression with factors transfection (empty plasmid, TRIP8b) and drug concentration (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18\u00a0\u03bcM) showed an effect of transfection (F(1,98)\u00a0= 7.73, p\u00a0= 8.1086E-21), an effect of drug (F(5,98)= 64.668, p\u00a0= 1.6692E-29), and an interaction between the two (F(5,98)\u00a0= 36.37, p\u00a0= 6.6418E-21).

H, current density of Ih was investigated in HEK293\u00a0cells stably expressing HCN2 and transiently transfected with TRIP8b. Cells were recorded after varying amounts of time in 5\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590. One-way ANOVA revealed an effect of time (F(3,52)\u00a0= 4.46, p\u00a0= 0.007) and post hoc analysis revealed significant differences only when comparing less than 1\u00a0h with greater than 24\u00a0h in 5\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590. I, using the same cells collected for (H), we also analyzed the half activation potential (V50) of Ih. One-way ANOVA revealed an effect of time (F(3,52)\u00a0= 13.50, p\u00a0= 1.24e-6) and post hoc analysis revealed differences between less than 1\u00a0h and 1 to 4\u00a0h (p\u00a0= 0.013), between less than 1\u00a0h and 8 to 10\u00a0h (p\u00a0= 4.38e-5), and between less than 1\u00a0h and greater than 24\u00a0h (p\u00a0= 2.11e-6). For the <1\u00a0h condition, 16\u00a0cells were used, 1 to 4\u00a0h condition was 12\u00a0cells, 8 to 10\u00a0h condition was 14\u00a0cells, and over 24\u00a0h was 14\u00a0cells.

                        "TRIP8b also upregulates HCN channel current density by increasing HCN channel surface trafficking (15, 23, 25, 39). Thus, we next examined the effect of NUCC-0200590 on HCN current density. As previously described, TRIP8b caused an increase in Ih current density in the absence of NUCC-0200590 (Fig.\u00a04F), but incubation with increasing concentrations of NUCC-0200590 led to a dose-dependent reduction in Ih (Fig.\u00a04F). Combined, these results establish that NUCC-0200590 abolished the known hyperpolarizing effect of TRIP8b on the V50 of HCN channels (suggesting TRIP8b is unbound from HCN) and disrupted TRIP8b-mediated increases in surface HCN channels (indicating fewer surface HCN channels).",
                        "To complement our electrophysiology results, we validated the effect of NUCC-0200590 on the surface trafficking of HCN channels using flow cytometry. In these assays, an HCN1 construct tagged with an extracellular hemagglutinin (HA) tag was used for flow cytometry such that surface expression of the channel can be measured in live cells (40). As has been shown previously, transfection of TRIP8b increased the surface expression of HCN1 (Fig.\u00a04G) (40). Consistent with our electrophysiology results, incubation with NUCC-0200590 led to a dose-dependent reduction in surface expression of HCN1 with an IC50 of 6.81\u00a0\u00b1 1.03\u00a0\u03bcM.",
                        "After noting that NUCC-0200590 disrupts the effect of TRIP8b on both HCN channel opening (V50) and surface trafficking, we next asked if these two effects are further dissociable. Specifically, we reasoned that looking at the time course of the change in V50 (TRIP8b binding to HCN channels) and Ih current density (surface expression of HCN channels) could inform the mechanism of NUCC-0200590\u2019s action. Toward that end, we examined the effect of incubating 5\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 on cells stably expressing HCN2 and transiently transfected with TRIP8b. We examined four time points: <1\u00a0h, 1 to 4\u00a0h, 8 to 10\u00a0h, and >24\u00a0h. Although it took at least 24\u00a0h for the current density (surface HCN channels) to become statistically different from the <1\u00a0h incubation condition, (Fig.\u00a04H), the effect on V50 (indicating TRIP8b dissociation from HCN) was apparent at 1 to 4\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a04I). These results indicate that NUCC-0200590 first disrupts the effect of TRIP8b on the V50 of Ih (within 1\u20134\u00a0h) prior to the loss of HCN channels from the cell surface. The implications of these findings for the mechanism of NUCC-0200590 are discussed later."

We used 15\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 (rather than 5\u00a0\u03bcM as in HEK cells in Fig.\u00a04,H and I), knowing that slices are harder to penetrate and that they cannot be incubated in\u00a0vitro for long as for HEK cells. We prepared slices from WT mice and incubated them for at least 2\u00a0h in 15\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 before whole-cell recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurons. In the WT slices, incubation with NUCC-0200590 led to a reduction in the Ih sag ratio, a current clamp measurement of the activity of HCN channels (Fig.\u00a05A/B). There were no differences noted in membrane resistance, resting membrane potential (Table\u00a0S1), or excitability (Fig.\u00a05E). To confirm that NUCC-0200590 limits the sag ratio by binding TRIP8b, we performed a control experiment using slices from genetic KO mice lacking all TRIP8b isoforms (Trip8b\u2212/\u2212) (15). Unlike the WT mice, there was no difference in sag ratio in the presence or absence of NUCC-0200590 in slices from Trip8b\u2212/\u2212 mice, consistent with a need for NUCC-0200590 to bind to TRIP8b in order to influence Ih (Fig.\u00a05, C, D and F).Figure\u00a05NUCC-0200590 limits the current mediated by HCN channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons.A, whole-cell recordings were performed from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices made from Trip8b+/+ mice. A subset of slices were incubated with 15\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 (in red). Representative current clamp traces are shown in response to a 1s long\u00a0\u2212200pA somatic current injection from a membrane potential of\u00a0\u221270\u00a0mV. Note that traces are scaled so that the maximum deflection is 100% to facilitate comparison of the sag ratio.

D, no differences were noted on two tail t test comparing the sag ratio recorded from Trip8b\u2212/\u2212 cells (0\u00a0\u03bcM/blue: 1.07\u00a0\u00b1 0.007, 15\u00a0\u03bcM/green: 1.05\u00a0\u00b1 0.02, two tail t test yields t\u00a0= 1.21, p\u00a0= 0.25, n\u00a0= 6,4).

                        "With data validating the effects on NUCC-0200590 in mouse brain slices, we next turned our attention to the question of whether NUCC-0200590 would disrupt TRIP8b function in\u00a0vivo. TRIP8b plays an essential role in trafficking HCN channels into the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and loss of TRIP8b\u2032s function leads to fewer HCN channels in the distal stratum lacunosum moleculare (15). To circumvent the rapid metabolism of the compound (aformentioned), we intrahippocampally injected 1\u00a0\u03bcl of 10\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 into the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus. The animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry to quantify HCN1 expression 48\u00a0h after the injection (see Experimental procedures). Compared with the contralateral hemisphere injected with an equivalent volume of vehicle (saline), the hemisphere injected with NUCC-0200590 showed significantly less staining for HCN1 (Fig.\u00a06, A and B).Figure\u00a06Immunohistochemistry reveals that NUCC-0200590 causes a reduction in TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking.A and B, Trip8b+/+ mice were injected unilaterally with 1\u00a0\u03bcl of 10\u00a0\u03bcM NUCC-0200590 and then sacrificed for immunohistochemistry 48\u00a0h later. C and D, identical experiments were carried out in mice lacking TRIP8b (Trip8b\u2212/\u2212) to determine if the change in HCN1 expression could be attributed to NUCC-0200590 binding to TRIP8b. E, for quantification, regions of interest were drawn over the injected side (B) and scaled by the intensity of the staining of the contralateral vehicle-injected hemisphere (A) so that a value of \u20181\u2019 reflects similar staining in the two hemispheres while values lower than 1 indicated less HCN1 expression.

Importantly, although these animals lack TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking, they still express HCN channels in the distal dendrites, and these channels can be further reduced by expressing a TRIP8b mutant after viral manipulation (14). In contrast to the WT mice, Trip8b\u2212/\u2212 mice that were injected with NUCC-0200590 showed no further reduction in hippocampal HCN1 staining when taken for immunohistochemistry 48\u00a0h after injection (Fig.\u00a06, C\u2013E)."

                "In this report, we have identified a new small molecule capable of disrupting the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction. Several groups have suggested that the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of MDD (8, 12, 41) and the development of compounds such as NUCC-0200590 may lead to mechanistically distinct antidepressants. We demonstrated a strategy for the synthesis of this compound and established the efficacy of NUCC-0200590 in disrupting the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Direct binding of the compound to TRIP8b was established using STD-NMR, which also provides epitope mapping to show areas of the molecule that closely bind to the target protein (Fig.\u00a02).",
                "Our cell-based assays demonstrated that NUCC-0200590 effectively disrupts the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction and provides an important mechanistic insight into how the compound limits TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel surface trafficking (Figs.\u00a04 and 7). We observed that NUCC-0200590 limits the effect of TRIP8b on the V50 of HCN channels within 1 to 4\u00a0h, indicating that the drug is acting on TRIP8b\u2013HCN complexes at the surface of the cell and causing a dissociation of TRIP8b from HCN (Fig.\u00a07, C and D). While this result indicates that TRIP8b is likely dissociated from HCN (Fig.\u00a07D), the channel remains present at the cell surface (given that we did not observe a statistically significant change in the surface density of Ih until a later time point, Fig.\u00a04H). TRIP8b(1a-4) binding limits lysosomal degradation of the channel (13, 15, 39), a process potentially responsible for the reduction in HCN channel surface expression after treatment with NUCC-0200590 (Fig.\u00a07E). Alternatively, it may be the case that the presence of NUCC-0200590 in complex with TRIP8b and HCN could promote an aberrant conformation of the TRIP8b\u2013HCN channel complex that leads to degradation. Future efforts to characterize how NUCC-0200590 limits TRIP8b-mediated surface trafficking of HCN channels could yield a temporally precise method for disrupting HCN channel function that genetic knockdown strategies are not able to achieve.Figure\u00a07Schematic highlighting proposed effect of NUCC-0200590 on TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking.A, model showing baseline levels of TRIP8b (green) bound to HCN (blue) with relative hyperpolarization of the V50 because of TRIP8b binding. B, summary of results from our prior report showing that after chronic stress, there is an increase in TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel surface expression in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons (17). The increase in surface expression of HCN channels causes the CA1 pyramidal neurons to be less excitable and ultimately influences cognitive impairment. C\u2013E, interpretation of our results from HEK cell electrophysiology. C, overexpression of TRIP8b leads to high levels of surface HCN channel expression with hyperpolarized V50. D, after a brief incubation with NUCC-0200590 (purple), TRIP8b dissociates from HCN channels such that the V50 of HCN depolarizes. Given the short incubation period, the HCN channels remain at the surface of the cell (high current density) but are unbound by TRIP8b. This period is represented in our data by the 1 to 4\u00a0h incubations in Figure\u00a04,H and I. E, after eight or more hours, the HCN channels at the cell surface that are no longer bound by TRIP8b are internalized and there is a reduction in Ih current density. This time point is represented in our data by the >24\u00a0h incubations in Figure\u00a04,H and I. HCN, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide\u2013gated.",
                "The dorsal CA1 region plays an essential role in spatial memory and other forms of learning (42, 43) and several lines of evidence have shown that depression-like behaviors are associated with less excitable CA1 pyramidal neurons while antidepressant-like behaviors are associated with greater excitability (4, 5, 6, 7). Disrupting either of the two TRIP8b\u2013HCN interacting sites is sufficient to limit TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking in neurons (14). Here, we have shown that NUCC-0200590, which only disrupts one of the two TRIP8b\u2013HCN binding sites, is sufficient to limit TRIP8b-mediated HCN channel trafficking in\u00a0vivo (Fig.\u00a06). We recently demonstrated that chemogenetically limiting the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction rescued the cognitive deficits that occurred in animals subjected to chronic stress (17); hence, we predict that a small molecule developed from NUCC-0200590 might be useful therapeutically to disrupt the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction and treat the cognitive sequelae of chronic stress.",
                "The biochemical observations made here suggest that a compound like NUCC-0200590 could meet an important unmet clinical need by functioning as a symptom-specific therapy for the treatment of MDD. The compound began disrupting the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction in 1 to 4\u00a0h in\u00a0vitro and led to reduced HCN surface trafficking noted afterward, suggesting that the compound could ultimately be used as a rapid acting therapy. This would provide a distinct advantage over existing monoaminergic therapies that typically require weeks to become efficacious. Interestingly, prior work has also shown that knockdown of HCN channel function in the dorsal hippocampus prior to stress limits the onset of behaviors relevant to MDD in an animal model (8). This raises the possibility that a therapy such as NUCC-0200590 could be used prophylactically to prevent the onset of a major depressive episode or to prevent the development of MDD entirely.",
                "A significant limitation of NUCC-0200590 is the compound\u2019s rapid degradation by liver microsomes. This liability will need to be addressed with additional chemical modifications to enable its use in animal models relevant to MDD. To date, most work on the TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction in\u00a0vivo has been carried out using genetic tools, but future efforts may take advantage of NUCC-0200590 or a derivative to better characterize the precise half-life of HCN channels at the neuronal surface in\u00a0vivo and in distinct molecular contexts. The TRIP8b\u2013HCN interaction holds promise as a mechanistically distinct therapeutic target for the treatment of MDD. While more work is needed to create a small molecule candidate for human trials, compounds acting on this interaction may ultimately have use for a variety of additional disorders including chronic pain (44) and anxiety (8, 45)."

The presented fluorescence index was calculated as the integral of the Alexa-647 fluorescence with respect to cell number, which was normalized by enhanced GFP (eGFP)\u2013positive cells in each transfection condition. The fluorescence indices for each condition were normalized to the control transfection condition (HCN1 plus eGFP). Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test."

                        "HEK cells stably expressing HCN2 (described in our previous report (22)) were plated on autoclaved 12\u00a0mm diameter glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (0.1\u00a0mg/ml) and washed with standard Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt medium (without calcium or magnesium). Cells were transiently transfected 24\u00a0h later with EGFP plus a control vector or TRIP8b(1a-4) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Lipofectamine exposure was limited to 60\u00a0min, followed by rinsing and replacing with of preconditioned culture medium. Different doses of NUCC-0200590 were added in the medium following transfection as described in Results. For time course studies, 5\u00a0\u03bcM of NUCC-0200590 was added in the medium. Whole-cell recordings were performed 24 to 48\u00a0h post-transfection with pipettes made from borosilicate glass using a vertical puller (Narishige) with a final resistance of \u223c3\u00a0M\u03a9. Cells were held at\u00a0\u221240\u00a0mV in voltage clamp and stepped from\u00a0\u221240 to\u00a0\u2212120\u00a0mV in 10\u00a0mV increments. Extracellular solution consisted of (in mM): 145 NaCl, 10 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 Hepes, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, buffered to pH 7.4, and an osmolarity of 312 to 315 mOsm. Intracellular pipette solution contained 135 K-gluconate, 10 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 Hepes, and 2 Mg-ATP buffered to pH 7.3 and an osmolarity of 295 to 305 mOsm. Maximal tail current amplitudes were fitted to the Boltzmann equation as described previously (25). Maximal Ih current density was calculated by dividing the maximal tail current by the cell capacitance, as described previously (24). Currents were recorded via WinWCP software (University of Strathclyde), a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices), and a National Instruments USB6221 interface card. Sampling rate was 10\u00a0kHz. Series resistance was monitored throughout each experiment and cells were discarded if the series resistance rose during the experiment. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test."
