                        "The extraction process of bitumen from oils sands produces process-affected water (e.g., oil sands process-affected water (OSPW)) as a by-product. The OSPW is contaminated with toxic organic compounds1-4, and many oil sand companies presently operate on zero-discharge policy for OSPW. As a result, the OSPW is stored on-site in tailing ponds, typically for several decades5. Presently, about 732 billion litres OSPW sit in tailings ponds that span about 77 square kilometers in the Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada6. Consequently, there is an urgent need to treat this contaminated water so that it can eventually be returned to the environment in a re-useable form7-9.",
                        "OSPW contains several major classes of contaminants including, such as for example, naphthenic acids (NAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylenes), phenols, heavy metals and ions10. Classic naphthenic acids (NAs), the primary acute toxic constituent of OSPW2,4,11, have long been defined as alkyl-substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids.",
                        "Current technologies in OSPW remediation include advanced oxidation/biodegradation, biodegradation/adsorption and flocculation/membrane filtration have been developed to achieve more efficient NA removal and sustainable process19. However, due to the high recalcitrancy20,21 of NA compounds to oxidation/biodegradation, incompatibility of physical treatment processes due to tailing ponds conditions19, and high costs associated with these technologies, current strategies do not provide a viable, safe, cost-effective, and sustainable approach to remediation. More specifically, NAs with greater carbon numbers and DBEs have been shown to be more recalcitrant and more toxic, due to their increased hydrophobicity and greater contribution to toxicity by narcosis22.",
                        "Technologies using naturally occurring microorganism for contaminant elimination have been around for some time. Early work by Herman et al.24 first demonstrated the biodegradation of NAs by microorganisms. Further, with developments in recombinant DNA techniques, there have been attempts to apply this technology to the breakdown of recalcitrant pollutants30 but these attempts have been met largely with failure. A lack of understanding and tools to investigate important parameters pertaining to microorganisms and their biodegradation processes has prevented further development of engineered microorganisms for such a purpose.",
                        "Consequently, there remains a need for such understanding and tools to provide for development of water treatment technologies to provide safer, effective, economically viable, and/or sustainable bioremediation strategies."

This is due, in part, to exposure to environmental contaminants, together with their tolerance for all sorts of physicochemical stresses (e. g. contact with oxidative stressors, temperature challenges, and sudden osmotic perturbations) and their ability to compete with predatory microbial species32. However, not all these microbial isolations are cultivable under standard laboratory conditions and therefore inaccessible for research. Further, recalcitrant NA compounds present a further challenge to effective degradation of toxic organic compounds. We hypothesized that microorganisms in OSPW might be able to degrade NAFCs but perhaps slowly and incompletely. FIG. 1C shows the microbial composition of OSPW. Availability of more biodegradable carbon sources compared to NAFCs could decrease the metabolic activities toward NAFCs biodegradation and favor the growth of non-degrading microbes. To ensure biodegradation of all classes of NAFCs, isolation and selection of effective microbes from OSPW is a key step. RNA-seq is a powerful tool to determine the transcriptomic response of bacteria upon exposure to NAFCs and provide insights into active degradation pathways and biodegradation mechanisms.",

Naphthenic acids fraction compounds (NAFCs) are the most toxic contaminants in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). NAFCs are a mixture of several hundred chemical compounds with general formula CcHhNnOoSs, where c is carbon number (7\u2264c\u226426), n, o and s represent the number of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms, respectively. Each NAFCs can be further categorized into Oo, NnOo, OoSs, NnSs, and NnOoSs based on the composition of heteroatoms in its empirical formula. Classic NAs (O2-NAs) have an empirical formula of CcHhO2 and are the most toxic class of NAFCs (FIGS. 1A and 1B). The water treatment technologies of OSPW are assessed based on degradation or removal of NAFCs, and NAs. Classic naphthenic acids (NAs), a subset of NAFCs, are the primary acute toxic constituent of OSPW2,4,11 and have long been defined as alkyl-substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids.

Changes in the chemosphere within OSPW changes were mapped during biodegradation within these strains using HPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens were selected for further NAs biodegradation analysis. For the study, the transcriptomic response of the environmental Pseudomonas strains to extracted NAs using RNA-seq method was investigated. The study also established a novel differentially expression analysis on RNA-seq data that enabled the investigation of the mechanisms by which the strains sense, uptake, and resist NAs, physiological response of Pseudomonas strains to NA exposure, reveal NA biodegradation pathways, and key enzymes. Combination of genetic data with NAs analytical data enabled the elucidation of the NAs degradome, and provided insights into the new chemical structures that have not been detected previously by analytical methods.",

Total peak area ratios for all homologues, based on the sum peak area ratio (peak area of analyte divided by the peak area of the internal standard) for all identified homologues from C7 to C22 and DBE=1 to DBE=10 were fit to a least squares regression.

O2-NAs comprise the majority of the NA species and correlate positively to the toxicity of OSPW. Measuring the concentration of NAFCs is a challenge due to lack of internal standard in HPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. So, NAFCs are analyzed based on their abundance of peaks not exact quantification of their concentration (FIG. 2A).",
                                "General formulae of CnH2n+ZO2 have been assigned to 131 identified NA compounds with the total concentration of 28.2 mg/L ranging from 5\u2264n\u226425 and 1\u2264DBE\u226410 (FIG. 1B). Carbon number of 16 and DBE of 4 groups with 20.08 and 21.33% of total measured concentration showed the most abundant NA compounds. DBE<5 compounds include the aliphatic (DBE=1) and alicyclic (DBE=2, 3 and 4) compounds. Bicyclic and tricyclic NAs were found to be more difficult to degrade than aliphatic or monocyclic NAs using NA surrogates20. DBE\u22655 could be alicyclic or polycyclic aromatic compounds. Aromatic NAs are demonstrated to be more toxic to embryos of zebrafish compared to alicyclic NAs33. Aliphatic and lower DBEs come in longer retention time while aromatic and polycyclic compounds eluted faster from the column. For example, C16H32O2, and C18H36O2 with retention times of 18.3 and 19.78, respectively, are potentially fatty acids with aliphatic structures. To have a more comprehensive insight toward recalcitrant NA compounds, we analyzed the degraded concentration (\u0394C) of each compound with respect to DBE, carbon number, and retention time (FIG. 8A-8D). It can be observed that recalcitrancy is not only dependent on the chemical structure, but also the metabolic capacity of the strains. Pseudomonas putida and stutzeri, for example, have shown higher biodegradation capacity for DBE=8 (C16, C17, and C18). It can also be observed that NA compounds with C14, C15, and C16 at DBE=4 were biodegradable among all isolated strains. Except for C16, all NA compounds at DBE=2 showed low biodegradability that could be related to alicyclic NA compounds such as cyclohexane carboxylic acid (CHCA) and cyclohexane acetic acid (CHAA)34."

The driver samples were identical to tester samples with the exception of NAs supplement that was replaced by additional M9S media.

Moreover, this technique eliminates the limitations of global gene expression analysis as it does not require complete genomic sequence information.

Prior to ORF predictions, the assembled genome database was processed using MetaPathways pipeline to renames input contigs with standardized identifiers and removes and any contigs smaller than 180 base pairs. Subsequently, MetaPathways was used to predict the open reading frames (ORFs). Predicted ORFs less than 180 base pairs or 60 amino acids in length are removed by default from downstream analysis to achieve more reliable alignment and annotation outcomes. MetaPathways76 ensures all annotations meet certain quality thresholds, and has default annotation parameters for FAST/LAST and BLAST that are fairly conservative (Length: 180 bp (60 aa), E-value: 1e-6, bit-score: 20, Bit-score ratio >0.4).

After digital normalization of original reads, three minimum abundance thresholds were used for each sample: 10, 20 and 100. Each of these nine datasets were assembled and the number of transcripts assembled was negatively correlated with the minimum abundance threshold. Only assemblies built with a minimum abundance threshold of 20 were chosen for downstream analysis in MetaPathways. After ORF prediction and QC, 619, 692, 901 translated ORFs were predicted for P. putida, P. fluorescens, and consortia, respectively.

Exposure of Pseudomonas putida to NA compound mixture resulted in expression of several porins including phaK (phenylacetate uptake) (FIG. 3B), oprF (non-specific large substrates), oprE (anaerobically induced porin required for growth on phenyl acetic acid-like molecules), oprQ (unknown substrates), oprL (Peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein), opdP (Glycine-glutamate dipeptide porin), and PP_3656 (specific aromatic porin). P. fluorescens also showed transport across the outer membrane with the aid of porins including oprF (PFS113_RS39290), oprB (PSF113_RS36845), and maltoporin (PSF113_RS35615). OprB is positively regulated by its substrates glucose, fructose, glycerol, and mannitol while maltoporin is indispensable for the uptake of maltodextrins.",
                                "NA compounds can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (supporting information 1) and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (FIGS. 3A and 3B), also called the uniporter-symporter-antiporter family44. Several MFS transporters for which expression can be associated with NA compounds were identified. For example, PP_3658 is benzoate transport protein from Aromatic Acid: H+ symporter (AAHS family); PP_3391 is tartrate MFS transporter from Anion:Cation Symporter (ACS family) in which the identical gene NP_001096662 has been differentially expressed45 in male fathead minnow when exposed to OSPW; yhjE has unknown function from Metabolite H+ symporter (MHS) family and in the phylogenetic tree is far from other compounds of this family; gudP is glucarate transporter from ACS family which can either transport organic or inorganic anions. Among the organic anions transported are glucarate, hexuronates, phthalate, allantoate, and probably tartrate; PP_2837 is uronate (FIG. 3B) transporter probably from ACS family44; PP_3250 is ATP:ADP antiporter (AAA family); PP_4001 is pore ion channel fluoride ion transporter CrcB. Over expression of this gene is related to protection of the chromosome from condensation by camphor46 which resembles the diamond structure of NA compounds including Adamantanecarboxylic acid47 (FIG. 3B) with methyl branches; PSF113_RS53065 has unknown function; PSF113_RS37090 is from AAHS family for aromatic acid transport (FIG. 3B).",
                                "Due to toxicity of some NA compounds to Pseudomonas cells, there are several levels of responses to toxic intracellular compounds that include structural alterations, general stress and metabolic responses, and active extrusion mechanisms48.",
                                "Efflux pumps (FIGS. 3A and 3B) are considered the most efficient mechanism of toxic compounds tolerance in Gram-negative bacteria. This mechanism consists of pumping excess toxic compound present in the cell (membrane, periplasm or cytoplasm) to the outer medium, effectively preventing chemicals from reaching lethal concentrations in the cell. Among the different families of efflux pumps, secondary multidrug transporters with the subdivisions of the MFS, small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, and the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family49, is of great importance in xenobiotic transport. For example, yhhS is carbohydrate efflux transporter; PP_0961 is ABC transporter as efflux pumps that is involved in the inducible resistance to toluene and is present only in strains which carry the tod pathway for toluene degradation48. MexF (MexEF pump) is involved in butanol and formaldehyde efflux; PP_1266 is fusaric acid (FA) (FIG. 3B) resistance protein50.",
                                "Highly FA resistant strains were found only in Gram-negative bacteria, mainly in the genus of Pseudomonas; mdtB and mdtC51 are multidrug efflux system which confer resistance against novobiocin and deoxycholate; Bcr/CflA is drug resistance proteins with the membrane spanning region of Bcr52 (bicyclomycin resistance protein); PP_517353,54 is a multidrug resistance efflux pump, TriABC-TolC which has been shown to be responsible for triclosan resistance of P. aeruginosa; PSF113_RS43745 is acriflavin resistance gene which maintains the concentration of this compound at lower concentration inside the cell. This compound is a basic dye which is sensed by the P. fluorescens strain in OSPW; PSF113_RS5066549 is from the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family which mediates resistance to dyes, hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides; PSF113_RS35960 is AcrB/AcrD/AcrF family protein which has long been known to be involved in resistance to basic dyes, detergents, and antibiotics49. Interference of toxic NA compounds with the electron transport systems causes increased production of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species which can be removed by OxyR or NrdR regulons, superperoxide dismutases, peroxidases, putative catalase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductases, thiol peroxidases, and putative glutathione peroxidases. Surrogate substrate of expressed enzymes in upper pathway analysis revealed some potential chemical structures in OSPW (see FIG. 3C) that have been reported for the first time."

                                "KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (FIGS. 4A-4D) showed that purine metabolism pathway is significantly enriched for all degradation samples. This pathway has been well-documented to play roles in antibiotic55,56, acid and stress tolerance57. It is suggested that modifications of flux through the purine nucleotide pathway and/or increased ppGpp concentrations provide a link between the physiological state of the cell and the level of stress tolerance and establish a role for the stringent response in acid stress response regulation.",

The key genes upregulated for the first path is pncB nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase. It is shown that exogenous niacin, that can be uptaken by aromatic compounds transporters, goes via niacin salvage pathway to generate NAD with the first enzymatic reaction 6.3.4.21 catalyzed by pncB gene product58,59. Then, the highest expressed gene in PS expression browser was nicE, the last step in nicotinate degradation pathway, (maleate isomerase) catalyzed the reaction EC 5.2.1.1.",

Surprisingly, P. putida generated maleate when exposed to OSPW due to biodegradation of nicotinate in OSPW. While it was discovered that the exact mass 123.03 in ESI\u2212 spectroscopy which can be associated to niacin existence in extracted OSPW, most of the nitrogen containing compounds might not be detected in negative ion mass spectroscopy. 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism pathway has been shown for all degradation samples while this pathway is significantly enriched for PC and FS with 9 and 10 gene counts, respectively. On this basis, the carbon metabolism global map of FS and PC were compared in FIGS. 5A-5D. It can be confirmed that only FS has significantly shunted isocitrate to glyoxylate using PSF113_RS41305 (isocitrate lyase), however, the further steps of glyoxylate cycle have not been differentially expressed. Since glyoxylate is toxic to this bacterium, it seems likely that a system is in place to retain it from accumulating.",

However, the first reaction of this alternative route which is catalyzed by L-alanine-\u03b1-keto acid aminotransferases64 (EC 2.6.1.-) has not been reconstructed in the map. Possible explanation for this observation might be the enzymes in transcriptomes of FS that could not be assigned to KO number. In FS degrading sample, the only differentially expressed aminotransferase which has not been assigned to KO number was PFS113_4986 pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase catalyzed the reaction EC 2.6.1.1. General, as compared to PS, FS showed more versatile carbon metabolism routes from different terminal catabolites, significantly enriched pathways in aromatic heterocycles metabolism including purines and pyrimidines, and complete oxidative phosphorylation map (18 genes).",

Literatures mostly proposed \u03b2-oxidation pathways (FIG. 11) for commercial NAs (CcH2c+zO2), however, biodegradation of complex environmental extracts (CcH2c+zNnOoSs) with unknown structures and fractions have not been characterized yet. The presence of a quaternary carbon at the \u03b1- or \u03b2-position or a tertiary carbon at the \u03b2- and \u03b2\u2032-position, prevents \u03b2-oxidation and leads to dead-end compounds in the reaction sequence of this pathway (recalcitrant NAs).",

In general, pathways that metabolize O compounds in NAFCs showed lower activity and variety in PS cultures. Also, the PS cultures uniquely expressed pathways for alginate biosynthesis (bacterial type II), benzoate degradation, trehalose biosynthesis (type IV), and ubiquinol-9 biosynthesis, which suggests that the PS and FS cultures use different mechanisms to degrade NAFCs. The PS cultures also showed unique reactions for degradation of substrates such as dihydroflavonol (1.1.1.219, catalyzed by dihydroflavonol-4-reductase) and branched fatty acids such as pristanate (6.2.1.3, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase). The pathways for L-phenylalanine biosynthesis I and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation were common between PS and FS cultures. However, the number and diversity of enzymes in pathways that metabolize O compounds, including long-chain fatty acid activation, and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation II, is significantly higher in PS cultures. The degradation of N and NO NAFC compounds by the PS cultures principally occurs via 4 pathways, namely uracil degradation I (reductive), L-phenylalanine degradation I (aerobic), folate transformations I, and phosphopantothenate biosynthesis I. There were also 5 genes with the reactions that could be assigned to N and NO substrates without a characterized pathway. These substrates are para nitrobenzoate, paraquat, methyl red, \u03b1-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, nicotinate and L-proline betaine. The PS cultures also express penicillin amidase proteins to metabolize NOS compounds.",

In the biodegradation of 0 compounds in NAFCs, FS culture showed 22 reactions or pathways. Fatty acid fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation III (unsaturated, odd number) showed the highest pathway perturbation score (PPS) 323 that PSF113_RS50625 gene product 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were shown to have substrates potentially related to NAFCs compounds. When fatty acids contain a cis-double bond on odd-numbered carbons, these compounds must be first converted to a (2E)-2-enoyl-CoA before they can be processed further by \u03b2-oxidation I pathway (PPS=264). L-phenylalanine biosynthesis (PPS=231) begins with the conversion of chorismate to prephenate catalyzed by the chorismite mutase the product of pheA. Enrichment of this pathway suggested that some mono cyclic compounds of NAFCs might be used to generate aromatic amino acids in these cultures. Other than \u03b2-oxidation pathways, lipid IVA biosynthesis has been also enriched with the substrate of fatty acids in the form of a (3R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-[acp] that is linked to UDP-N-acetyl-\u03b1-D-glucosamine to form the lipid IVA intermediate in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway. Glyoxylate shunt\u2014or, to be more precise, the step catalyzed by isocitrate lyase\u2014is also upregulated in FS culture suggesting the versatility of catabolic routes for utilizing NAFCs as a source of carbon.",

CFA synthase is a key enzyme in the pathway and methylenates the acyl chains of unsaturated fatty acids to their cyclopropane derivatives. The expression of this enzyme indicates that the degradation products of NAs may be eventually feeding into lipid biosynthesis, which is consistent with the observation lipid metabolism GO term in FS culture. Enrichment of chorismate biosynthesis from 3-dehydroquinate pathway indicates that cyclic structures of NAFCs (structures like 3-dehydroquinate) might be converted to chorismite that is an intermediate in the synthesis of the three aromatic amino acids: L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan. Acyl-CoA thioesterase (tesB gene product) hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoAs to free fatty acids supporting growth on fatty acids or conjugated fatty acid as the sole source of carbon in acyl-CoA hydrolysis pathway (PPS=0.68).",

Protocatechuate degradation II (ortho-cleavage pathway) is a well know pathway in degradation of various aromatic compounds, and part of 3-oxoadipate pathway that are both enriched in FS cultures. Biodegradation of a variety of aromatic compounds could generate protocatechuate, key intermediate metabolites, that is then converted to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA in 3-oxoadipate pathway, to be processed by TCA cycle. As for single reactions that showed matching compounds in the RNA-seq data, the highest RPKM belonged to PSF113_RS41260 gene product catalyzing the generation of menadiol from menadione with EC:1.6.5.11.
