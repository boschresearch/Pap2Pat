    "title": "Transcriptome Analysis of Environmental Pseudomonas Isolates Reveals Mechanisms of Biodegradation of Naphthenic Acid Fraction Compounds (NAFCs) in Oil Sands Tailings",
    "date": "2021-10-09",
    "abstract": "Naphthenic acid fraction compounds (NAFCs) are highly recalcitrant constituents of oil sands tailings. Although some microorganisms in the tailings can individually and synergistically metabolize NAFCs, the biochemical mechanisms that underpin these processes are hitherto unknown. To this end, we isolated two microorganisms, Pseudomonas protegens and Pseudomonas putida, from oils sands tailings and analyzed their transcriptomes to shed light on the metabolic processes employed by them to degrade and detoxify NAFCs. We identified 1048, 521 and 1434 genes that are upregulated in P. protegens, P. putida and a 1:1 co-culture of the strains, respectively. We subsequently enumerated the biochemical activities of enriched genes and gene products to reveal the identities of the enzymes that are associated with NAFC degradation. Separately, we analyzed the NAFCs that are degraded by the two pseudomonads and their 1:1 co-culture and determined the composition of the molecules using mass spectrometry. We then compared these molecular formulas to those of the cognate substrates of the enriched enzymes to chart the metabolic network and understand the mechanisms of degradation that are employed by the microbial cultures. Not only does the consortium behave differently than the pure cultures, but our analysis also revealed the mechanisms responsible for accelerated rate of degradation of NAFCs by the co-culture. Our findings provide new directions for engineering or evolving microorganisms and their consortia for degrading NAFCs more stably and aggressively.",

                "The oil sands in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta is an unconventional and plentiful energy reserve [1]. The mining and extraction of bitumen from these deposits consumes copious quantities of water. Conversely, bitumen extraction also generates a large volume of wastewater called oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) [2]. This waste stream is chronically and acutely toxic to aquatic life [3,4,5,6,7], and the principal toxicants in OSPW are a large group of organic molecules called naphthenic acids fraction compounds (NAFCs). The general formula of NAFCs is CcHhNnOoSs and their carbon content ranges between seven and 26 atoms [8,9,10]. OSPW contains several hundred NAFCs that can be further divided into Oo, NnOo, OoSs, NnSs and NnOoSs compounds [5,11]. Several of these molecules are unsaturated, and the degree of unsaturation of an NAFC can be inferred from its double bound equivalents (DBE) [12,13], which is estimated as c + \u00bd(n \u2212 h) + 1. Most of the debate surrounding the toxicity of OSPW in the popular press, however, has centered on a specific sub-group of NAFCs known as classic naphthenic acids (NAs). These molecules have an empirical formula of CcHhO2 and have been determined by environmental researchers to be the most toxic NAFCs [14,15,16]. Current environmental regulations forbid direct discharge into surrounding bodies of water [17,18], and the OSPW is stored on-site in large tailings ponds while it awaits detoxification. However, NAFCs are notoriously recalcitrant, which makes OSPW very difficult to treat effectively and economically. As a consequence, the volume of untreated OSPW in the tailings ponds is continually rising and the inventory of water now exceeds 700 billion liters. This large volume of toxic water has amplified concerns about seepage into bodies of ground and surface water and contamination of sources of drinking water, not to mention the risks of a catastrophic spill. There is an unmet, urgent need for the development of wastewater treatment technologies that can economically rehabilitate OSPW [19].",
                "The high concentration of NAFCs and other toxic compounds in the OSPW tailings ponds has sustained a unique ecological niche that abounds with microorganisms that have evolved to sense, uptake and metabolize these compounds and survive in this extreme environment [20,21,22]. Proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in the microbiome in OSPW tailings ponds [14,23,24], and, herein, several microbial species of the genus Pseudomonas have been shown to degrade a subset of NAs and detoxify OSPW, albeit at exceedingly slow rates [16,25,26,27,28,29]. Microbial bioremediation clearly is a promising solution for decontamination and detoxification of OSPW. However, the range of structures and the rates at which NAFCs are degraded by these native microorganisms necessitates significant improvements in order for bioremediation to be sustainable and economical at scales required by oil sands operators [30,31,32]. Methodologies such as targeted genome engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution will be central to improving the substrate range and rate of biodegradation of NAFCs but these techniques require sound understanding of the biochemical pathways involved [32]. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of biodegradation of NAFCs are either poorly understood or have been delineated for idealized substrates [29,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41]. In fact, the biodegradation pathways of most NAFCs in OSPW, notably NnOo, OoSs, NnSs, and NnOoSs compounds, are entirely unknown. Elucidation of the genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways responsible for adaptation to and degradation of NAFCs is necessary in order to effectively and economically remediate OSPW.",
                "The first step in investigating the mechanisms of biodegradation of NAFCs is isolating and enriching appropriate microbial chassis that could serve as key constituents of the bioremediation platform. Next, analyzing the transcriptomic responses using RNA-seq of the microorganisms to exposure to NAFCs sheds light on the genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways responsible for adaptation to and degradation of the toxic compounds [42,43]. We previously isolated two pseudomonads, P. protegens and P. putida, that can metabolize NAFCs in OSPW by exploiting their ability to grow on these compounds as the sole source of carbon in plate and liquid cultures [44]. Chemical analyses of the culture medium before and after biological activity revealed that the two microorganisms exhibit unique propensities and rates for degrading NAFCs and that these differences are more pronounced for classic NAs. In the current study, we have employed RNA-seq to elucidate the mechanisms of biodegradation of NAFCs by individual and co-cultures of P. protegens and P. putida. Till date, no studies have been performed on transcriptomic response of microorganisms isolated from OSPW tailings ponds. In addition to deducing the transcriptional responses of P. protegens and P. putida, we also correlated this information to mass spectrometry data to identify NAFCs as substrates of individual enzymes. The substrates were then classified based on their heteroatom compositions and the enzyme-substrate pairs were then used to construct the biodegradation pathways. Finally, we also compared the metabolic networks of the two strains in individual and 1:1 co-culture with an eye on developing consortia for biodegradation."

We stored the samples in sealed polyethylene containers in the dark at 4 \u00b0C. To test the samples, we first removed suspended particulate matter from 1 L batches of OSPW using vacuum filtration through grade-4 glass fiber filters having a nominal particle retention size of 1.2 \u03bcm. The pH of the filtered water was then lowered to pH 2 using H2SO4 and NAFCs were subsequently extracted with 100 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). The OSPW was treated twice with the same batch of DCM to maximize the concentration of the extracted NAFCs. For analytical characterization, the organic fraction was dissolved in a 1:1 solution (by volume) of acetonitrile and deionized water until the nominal concentration of NAFCs in the solution matched that of the original OSPW sample. We analyzed this mixture using HPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Details about the chromatography and mass spectrometry methods have been detailed in the accompanying Electronic Supporting Information (ESI) package."

The two cultures were propagated overnight at 22 \u00b0C under agitation at 200 rpm and were then used to separately inoculate 50 mL of filtered OSPW in 250 mL shaker flasks. In addition to pure cultures of the two strains, we also prepared a 1:1 co-culture. All cultures had a starting optical density (OD600) of 0.1.

The extent of degradation of NAs by the cultures over the 30-day period was then quantified using HPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Additionally, we also resuspended the extracted NAFCs in deionized water to a level that matches their original concentration in OSPW.

                        "We characterized the transcriptional responses of the three cultures by determining the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers of the gene products that were previously identified using RNA-seq (Figure 1, teal boxes). Functional annotation of the genes for each RNA-seq library was performed using GO annotations with Blast2GO, InterProScan [50] and the nr database of the Pseudomonas genus with a BLAST expectation value of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123. The GO terms from Blast2GO and InterProScan were then merged and used for characterization of the transcriptional responses of the Pseudomonas cultures to NAFCs. The statistical over-representation analysis for GO terms was performed using the universal enricher function of the clusterProfiler package from Bioconductor [51]. We focused on the biological processes (BPs) and molecular functions (MFs) clusters owing to the high likelihood of these genes being involved in biodegradation of NAFCs. Similarly, we assessed the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers by cross-referencing the results of Blast2GO\u2019s EC mapping function with EC numbers of the products of E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. genes in the UniProt database that were annotated by Prokka. In order to determine the metabolic network responsible for biodegradation of NAFCs, we developed an entirely novel approach that co-analyses transcript and chemical data. The code for the analysis is included in the two Jupyter notebooks in the ESI package.",
                        "Briefly, the code in the first notebook matches the EC numbers of gene products identified from the RNA-seq libraries with enzymatic reactions in the MetaCyc database, fetches the Pubchem IDs of the substrates for the identified reactions and then retrieves their molecular formulas from the Pubchem database. Next, the algorithm classifies the retrieved molecular formulas into NAFC groups based on their heteroatom composition. These groups include Oo, NnOo, OoSs, Ss, Nn, NnOoSs and CH NAFCs. Differences between the substrates deduced for the pure cultures and co-cultures were assessed statistically with the aid of the Pearson\u2019s Chi square test for count data in R using the function chisq.test. The compounds identified using the aforementioned algorithm were subsequently inputted to the second Jupyter notebook. Due to over-generality of the integrated pathway maps on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, we used more localized and individualized maps on MetaCyc to identify the NAFC degradation pathways. The algorithm finds and matches the chemical IDs (CID) of the substrates to EC numbers of putative enzymes, and later interrogates all combinations of CID-EC combinations in the entire MetaCyc database. This search outputs two data frames for the CID-EC pairs, one with and the other without pathway information. These data frames are re-classified into the dominant NAFC groups (e.g., O, N, NO, NOS, S and SO compounds, among others), which finally allows for the determination of the presence or absence of CID-EC pairs in specific pathways. We also investigated the effect of co-operative metabolism in the co-culture by calculating the fold-change of the TPM values for P. putida and P. putida when the strains are cultured individually or together. Specifically, we identified KEGG pathways in P. putida and P. protegens whose constituent enzymes exhibited fold-changes lower and greater than 1 in the pure cultures or co-culture."

OSPW and all three microbially-treated water samples contain a significantly higher fraction of O2, O3 and O4 NAFCs compared to other oxygenated species. Additionally, with the exceptions of SO2 and SO3 species, the proportion of S- and N-containing NAFCs is also relatively low in all four samples. This chemical distribution is consistent with previous reports. Additionally, O7, O8, N2O2, and S2O3 groups do not occur in OSPW but are generated by microbial metabolism.",
                        "On the other hand, S, N2S3, NOS2 and N2OS2 NAFCs are completely removed from OSPW after biodegradation. We speculate that these compounds are consumed by microorganisms as a source of sulfur. We also quantified the concentration of classic NAs in OSPW and their extent of removal by microbial activity. NAs are the major toxicants in OSPW [5]. We identified as many as 131 unique compounds that had a cumulative concentration of 28.2 mg/L. Their carbon numbers and DBEs ranged between 5\u201325 and 1\u201310, respectively. Of these, species containing 16 carbon atoms comprised 20.1% of the population of classic NAs, whereas compounds with a DBE of 4 accounted for 21.3% of the population. Aliphatic compounds most commonly have a DBE of 1, whereas the DBEs of alicyclic compounds range between 2\u20134. The raw gas chromatograms revealed that aliphatic and alicyclic NAs exhibit longer column retention times compared to aromatic and polycyclic compounds in our experiment. The pure cultures of P. putida, P. protegens and the 1:1 co-culture reduced the concentration of NAs in the culture media by 11%, 12% and 31%, respectively (Figure 2B). These extents of degradation are roughly twice that of values detected by other groups, albeit using different, possibly niche Pseudomonas isolates [28]. We also plotted the difference between the concentrations of an individual NAFCs before (Cio) and after (Ci) microbial treatment as a heat map for each of the three cultures (Figure S1 in the ESI package).",

Additionally, we also observed that the concentrations of some NAFCs increased after microbial treatment, which reveals these species to be products of the degradation of other NAFCs. Finally, while the resuspended solution of extracted NAFCs elicited an average EC50 value of 82%, treatment with pure cultures of P. putida, P. protegens and the 1:1 co-culture reduced the toxicity of the solution to EC50 values of 94%, 92% and 100%, respectively."

The latter is critical for identification of novel genes that are selectively expressed upon exposure to NAFCs. The combination of high levels of enrichment, low background and normalized abundance of cDNA in the subtracted mixtures is ideal for rapid cloning of cDNA of the differentially expressed genes. Exposure to NAFCs elicited the expression of 1048 and 521 genes in pure cultures of P. protegens and P. putida, respectively. A total of 1434 genes were differentially expressed by cells in the 1:1 co-culture, of which 993 genes were expressed by P. protegens.

The results suggest that P. putida leverages consortial metabolism to its advantage. The strain expresses fewer enzymes in the co-culture compared to pure cultures with the sole exception of hydrolases, which are greatly overexpressed in the co-culture. The biological significance of differential expression of hydrolases needs to be probed further. Additionally, in lieu of replication of the transcriptomics experiment, we confirmed phenotypic reproducibility by repeating the experiment to quantify biodegradation of NAFCs well over a dozen times.

Additionally, the 3-oxoadipate degradation pathway is only expressed by P. protegens in pure cultures. This pathway was initially identified in P. putida for its conversion of catechol and protocatechuate [52]. On the other hand, the phenylacetate degradation pathway is only expressed by both strains in the co-culture, whereas the methylsalicylate pathway is expressed by pure cultures of both strains but not in the co-culture. We hypothesize that the strains utilize the methylsalicylate pathway to convert 4-methylsalicylate and 5-methylsalicylate into 4-methylcatechol, which is then degraded via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway [53], but expression of the pathway in only the pure cultures is an intriguing observation. Similarly, the cytosolic NADPH production and D-galacturonate degradation pathways are only detected in P. protegens in the 1:1 co-culture.",
                        "The metabolism of N and NO compounds could involve the participation of as many as 59 pathways in P. protegens in the 1:1 co-culture and as few as 27 pathways in pure cultures of P. putida. Six pathways\u2014L-ornithine biosynthesis, nitrate reduction, purine nucleobases degradation, spermidine biosynthesis, the polyamine biosynthetic superpathway and thiosulfate disproportionation\u2014are uniquely expressed by P. protegens in the co-culture. On the other hand, pure cultures of the same host express six unique pathways for biosynthesis of 2-aminoethylphosphonate, adenosine ribonucleotides, UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-\u03b1-D-mannuronate, glutathione, homoglutathione, ophthalmate and 4-amino-2-methyl-5-diphosphomethylpyrimidine, as well as a unique pathway for deconjugation of bile acids. The only pathway that is uniquely detected in pure cultures of P. putida is the glycine biosynthetic pathway, a single reaction pathway comprising the metabolite 5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroyl mono-L-glutamate. The NOS pathways for oxygen-independent biosynthesis of heme b and the biosynthesis of 3,8-divinyl-chlorophyllide were detected in all four samples. Additionally, P. protegens cells in the consortium express five unique pathways for degradation of NOS compounds, including the methylwyosine, 7-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-wyosine and wybutosine biosynthetic pathways, the superpathway for polyamine biosynthesis and a pathway for 5-oxo-L-proline metabolism.",
                        "Pure cultures of P. protegens also uniquely express the taurine degradation pathway and the biosynthetic pathways for ergothioneine and glutathione, whereas pure cultures of P. putida uniquely express the biosynthetic pathway for deacetylcephalosporin C. Herein, isopenicillin N is isomerized to penicillin N, following which the penam thiazolidine ring is oxidatively opened and expanded to yield a six-membered dihydrothiazine ring. Incidentally, the pure cultures of both strains express methylsalicylate degradation pathway. Lastly, the only unique pathways that play a role in metabolism of S and SO compounds were detected in cultures of P. protegens. Of these, three pathways were uniquely expressed by P. protegens cells in the co-culture, whereas the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway is uniquely detected in the pure culture."

                        "We estimated the ratio between the TPM values of each pseudomonad in the 1:1 co-culture and each pure culture. The use of suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) for generating the RNA-seq libraries ensures that the calculated TPM values for the tester samples adequately measure the up-regulated genes. Genes with a positive log2 fold-change (viz. increased TPM values in the co-culture) are enriched and probably play a greater role in metabolism of NAFC in the co-culture compared to the pure cultures, which provides useful insights on synergistic metabolism by the strains. Similarly, the MA plot for differential expression of the genes reveals that the distribution of expression is more or less symmetrical (Figure 6). We also cross-referenced the genes exhibiting the greatest changes in TPM between the 1:1 co-culture and the pure cultures of both strains in the database of KEGG pathways to shed light on how the metabolic networks of both strains adapt during co-culturing (the top five hits are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, all pathways have been summarized in Table S4 in the ESI). Additionally, we have also compiled the maps of the top five pathways in Figure S2, which has been uploaded to the article\u2019s webpage as a separate file."

                "We investigated the transcriptomic responses of pure and 1:1 co-culture of two pseudomonads, P. protegens and P. putida after exposure to a concentrated mixture of NAFCs extracted from OSPW. Both strains were isolated from OSPW.",
                "Unlike previous studies on microbial degradation of OSPW that solely focused on either quantifying the composition of the microbial consortium before and after degradation of NAFCs or confirming specific metabolic activities in the native microbiome of OSPW or deciphering the mechanisms of biodegradation of individual model NAFCs by varying their structures [37,54,55], our investigation is the first of its kind to co-analyze transcriptomic, metabolite and toxicity data and elucidate the metabolic networks involved in degradation of all heteroatom classes of NAFCs by pure and co-cultures of the two strains. We established an entirely novel bioinformatics workflow to achieve this objective and deduced that the molecular distribution of the substrates that are degraded by both pure cultures and the 1:1 co-culture are significantly different.",
                "We also confirmed that the 1:1 co-culture degrades a higher quantity of NAFCs compared to pure cultures of the two pseudomonads. The co-culture also completely detoxifies OSPW after 30 days of treatment. Additionally, P. protegens showed an over-representation of fatty acids, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways, which can be relevant to the degradation of linear NAs and nitrogen containing NAFCs, respectively. Our analysis also revealed that GO terms such as carbohydrate metabolism, oxidoreductase activity, purine biosynthesis and metabolic pathways involved in processing macromolecules, heterocyclic compounds and organic cyclic compounds are significantly over-represented in the samples. The data also indicate that the strains employ a variety of oxidoreductases, hydrolases and ligases to metabolize the NAFCs. Finally, our experimental observation that the 1:1 co-culture is stable is corroborated by the KEGG pathway analysis, which reveals how the metabolic network for NAFCs is shared between the two strains. Our findings indicate that the potential co-operative interaction between isolated P. protegens and P. putida can be further extended to biodegradation of more NAFCs.",
                "In closing, our work represents a significant advance for the field of microbial bioremediation that opens previously unavailable opportunities to rationally engineer or adaptively evolve more strains with improved phenotypic traits. In particular\u2014and courtesy of the mainstreaming of metagenomic screening\u2014one could replace rate-limiting enzymes in the identified degradation pathways with heterologues that exhibit higher kcat/Km values. Enzyme engineering too can be employed to alter an enzyme\u2019s substrate specificity, cofactor dependency, enhance kcat and/or lower Km. In light of the poor solubility of NAs in water, we believe that achieving lower Km values is arguably more important than achieving higher kcat values since microbial growth in tailings ponds will also be constrained by the availability of iron, phosphate and nitrogen, among other variables. To that end, one could employ adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to selectively improve the phenotype of environmental strains by culturing them in concentrated mixtures of NAs in a chemostat or batch reactor for prolonged durations [56]. ALE traces its roots to the pioneering work by Senior et al., who successfully employed the method to evolve P. putida to express a more active dehalogenase, thereby permitting it to grow on the herbicide Dalapon [57]."
