    "title": "Modular detergents tailor the purification and structural analysis of membrane proteins including G-protein coupled receptors",
    "date": "2020-01-28",
    "abstract": "Detergents enable the purification of membrane proteins and are indispensable reagents in structural biology. Even though a large variety of detergents have been developed in the last century, the challenge remains to identify guidelines that allow fine-tuning of detergents for individual applications in membrane protein research. Addressing this challenge, here we introduce the family of oligoglycerol detergents (OGDs). Native mass spectrometry (MS) reveals that the modular OGD architecture offers the ability to control protein purification and to preserve interactions with native membrane lipids during purification. In addition to a broad range of bacterial membrane proteins, OGDs also enable the purification and analysis of a functional G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). Moreover, given the modular design of these detergents, we anticipate fine-tuning of their properties for specific applications in structural biology. Seen from a broader perspective, this represents a significant advance for the investigation of membrane proteins and their interactions with lipids.",

                "Membrane proteins are targets for more than 50% of current drugs1. Among them, GPCRs are the most intensively studied due to their substantial role in human health and disease2. At the same time, investigating bacterial membrane proteins is key for improvements in the development of antibiotics3. The native host environment of all membrane proteins is, however, highly dynamic and heterogeneous and this constitutes a bottleneck for their direct structural analysis. Consequently, membrane protein complexes are extracted from their native environment with detergents, which are traditionally used to dissolve biological membranes. Detergents disrupt lipid\u2013lipid and protein\u2013lipid interactions in membranes and form soluble proteomicelles by shielding the hydrophobic surfaces of proteins from water4\u20137. Proteomicelles enable the purification of membrane proteins by separation techniques and in this way detergents facilitate the structural elucidation of this unique protein class.",
                "Although the field of synthetic detergent chemistry is well established, with first reports more than 100 years ago8, suitable detergents for membrane protein research are still typically identified by trial and error. The number of detergent families is staggeringly diverse and their chemical variety makes it increasingly difficult to define design guidelines to predict the utility of detergents for purifying membrane proteins. Furthermore, the concentration of detergent used in purification protocols is often adjusted to a multiple of its\u2019 critical aggregation concentration (cac)9. Interestingly, however, detergents with similar cac values can exhibit opposing compatibilities with proteins. For example, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and tetraethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E4) have similar cac values. However, SDS is a strong protein denaturant while C8E4 preserves native structural features of various membrane proteins. This makes it very difficult to predict the utility of detergents for protein purification according to their cac values. Together these attributes contribute to the emergence of the universal dogma that the selection of detergents depends more on empirical factors than on scientific principles10,11.",
                "Here we investigate whether or not the ability of detergents to purify or analyze membrane proteins can be optimized by changing their molecular structure. To address this question, we introduce the family of oligoglycerol detergents (OGDs) for membrane protein research. Research on this family of detergents has primarily been focused on the structure-based understanding of their self-assembly in aqueous solution and the potential of their aggregates to be used as nanocarriers for hydrophobic drugs12\u201315. The modular architecture of OGDs, and underlying synthetic protocols, allow us to readily fine-tune the structure of the head group, linker, and tail for individual research purposes, which is a valuable perquisite for bottom-up investigations (Fig.\u00a01). Here, we explore the utility of OGDs for protein purification and apply native mass spectrometry (MS) to study the structure of purified membrane protein complexes after removing the OGD micelle within a mass spectrometer16. Recent breakthroughs in high resolution MS technology enable not only the analysis of intact oligomers but also their binding to native membrane lipids17,18. Our results provide direct evidence that the modular OGD architecture can be optimized for the isolation of membrane proteins as well as the preservation of protein subunit interactions and binding to native membrane lipids. Our data also show that OGDs enable the purification of a functional neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTSR1)\u2014a member of the GPCR family, which is currently one of the most challenging and interesting protein classes in pharmacology2.Fig. 1Describing the modular architecture of OGDs.a The molecular architecture of OGDs comprises a hydrophilic head, a hydrophobic tail, and a connecting linker. b, c OGD regioisomer mixtures based on first-generation [G1] or second-generation [G2] triglycerol are composed of different head group regioisomers (top), linker, and tail structures (bottom). The modular OGD architecture allows this detergent family to be optimized for protein purification, charge reduction, and lipid co-purification."

                        "The ability to tune a particular detergent for isolating large protein quantities, and at the same time preserving protein interactions to native membrane lipids during isolation, is a major goal in membrane protein research4\u20136. Although proteomicelles provide the water-solubility that is necessary for protein purification, they poorly mimic the heterogeneous structure of lipid membranes19. This causes protein instability and, in the worst case, it reduces the amounts of protein that can be isolated.",
                        "We hypothesized that increased heterogeneity of OGDs might enhance their ability to replicate natural membrane environments. For this purpose, we synthesized detergent regioisomer mixtures based on first [G1] and second [G2] generation dendritic triglycerol (1\u20135, Fig.\u00a01). Previous reports have shown that the size of the detergent head is inversely correlated to the ability of a particular detergent to dissolve lipid membranes4. Specifically, the larger the detergent head, the lower the detergent\u2019s propensity to break up lipid\u2013lipid and protein\u2013lipid interactions in biological membranes. Based on this result, we anticipate that tuning the size of the OGD head, e.g. [G1] or [G2], will have a direct impact on the propensity of OGDs to extract and delipidate membrane proteins. Furthermore, the high water-solubility of the [G2] head also enables the synthesis of water-soluble OGDs using lipid-solubilizing cholesterol or double chain motifs, which closely resemble the structure of biological phospholipids. In addition, we reasoned that changing the basicity of the linker between the OGD head and tail, e.g. ether/carbamate\u2009<\u2009triazole, would allow us to effectively tune charge states of membrane proteins in mass spectra\u2014a feature that is of enormous interest within the emerging native MS community20\u201324. Having synthesized these detergents we now evaluate their ability to extract membrane proteins, retain subunit interactions, and lipid binding properties, as well as to produce favorable characteristics for native mass spectra."

                        "First, we probed the utility of the OGD design for membrane protein isolation. Different constructs of the aquaporin channel (AqpZ), the ammonia channel (AmtB), and the multidrug efflux pump (MATE) were extracted from E. coli membranes using 1\u20135 (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Figs.\u00a01 and 2). Following a previous purification protocol25, cell membranes were solubilized for 16\u2009h and purified via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The relative protein amounts were determined by UV/VIS spectroscopy. Subsequently, the relative protein amounts obtained from 1\u20135 were compared with n-dodecyl-\u00df-d-maltoside (DDM). This detergent enables the purification of high protein yields and is a current standard in structural biology (Fig.\u00a02b)26.Fig. 2OGDs tailor the purification and native MS analysis of membrane proteins.a Three membrane proteins were isolated from cell membranes using OGDs 1\u20135. b Higher relative protein concentrations are obtained from [G1] OGDs. The [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 2 (=2a\u2009+\u20092b) leads to a higher extraction yield than the individual regioisomers 2a and 2b. Relative protein concentrations were plotted with standard deviation (\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.d., n\u2009=\u20093). c Mass spectra obtained from tetrameric AqpZ-GFP after isolation with the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 reveal no protein complexes with native membrane lipids (upper spectrum). Substitution of the head group and hydrophobic tail in the [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4 enabled the detection of protein complexes with native membrane lipids (lower spectrum). Spectra were acquired using similar instrument conditions (HCD energy: 200\u2009V). AqpZ tetramers are indicated by four blue circles, cardiolipins by violet circles, and phospholipids by orange circles. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
                        "In the case of AqpZ, we found that the relative protein concentrations obtained following extraction and purification with 1 and 2 were about two times higher than with DDM (Fig.\u00a02b). This highlights the potential of [G1] OGD regioisomer mixtures for isolating high yields of proteins from cell membranes. Interestingly, protein quantities obtained from 2, which contained two OGD regioisomers, were higher than that of the individual regioisomers 2a and 2b. We found similar trends in the case of AmtB (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). However, differences in extraction efficiency between the regioisomer mixture 2 and the individual isomers 2a and 2b were less pronounced than in the case of AqpZ, but still statistically significant (Supplementary Table\u00a01). To the best of our knowledge, such an increase in solubilized protein quantities arising from a mixture of detergent regioisomers has not been reported previously. In contrast, the relative protein concentrations of AqpZ obtained from [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 3\u20135 were lower than those obtained from [G1] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1\u20132 or DDM. Similar results were obtained for the isolation of AmtB and MATE (Supplementary Figs.\u00a01 and 2).",
                        "To assess the secondary structure of the proteins upon purification we investigated the samples using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. A high alpha-helical content was observed in samples that were isolated by DDM as well as by the [G1] and [G2] regioisomer mixtures 1 and 4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). This observation underlines the utility of OGDs for preserving the native secondary structure of alpha-helical membrane proteins during purification. In addition, we noticed high beta-sheet content in the case of GFP-tagged proteins, such as MATE and AqpZ, which shows that the native secondary structure of the tags was also preserved.",
                        "Apart from isolating alpha-helical membrane proteins from membranes, such as MATE, AqpZ, and AmtB, we also attempted to refold and solubilize the G236K/K237G mutant of the beta-barrel outer membrane protein T (OmpT) with DDM as well as with OGD regioisomer mixtures. First, we solubilized OmpT from inclusion bodies with urea, then diluted the OmpT-urea mixture into detergent-containing refolding buffer, and isolated the protein using IMAC. Again higher relative protein quantities were obtained from DDM and the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1. Analysis of the ratio between folded and unfolded OmpT revealed higher relative proportions of folded OmpT in the case of DDM (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). However, protein quantities obtained from the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 were about three times higher than from DDM, thus leading to a higher yield of refolded OmpT under comparable conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). To investigate if DDM and the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 can be used to successfully refold OmpT into a functionally active conformation, we enriched folded OmpT to equal amounts using a second IMAC purification step. The mixture of folded and unfolded OmpT was bound to an IMAC column and eluted using an intermediate imidazole concentration (40\u2009mM). This led to an enrichment of folded OmpT to ~70% in both detergent environments (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). CD spectroscopy revealed a similar high beta-sheet content in both samples, thus confirming the expected secondary structure of OmpT (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). OmpT is a protease and its proteolytic activity depends on binding to an outer membrane lipid component: smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS)27. Time-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy experiments revealed a similar proteolytic activity of refolded OmpT upon addition of S-LPS and the self-quenching fluorescent peptide Abz-ARRAY-Tyr(NO2)-NH2 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). As expected, the proteolytic activity of OmpT was enhanced in the presence of S-LPS and reduced in the absence of S-LPS, which underlines that the LPS-mediated protease mechanism is acting in both detergent environments. Our data therefore highlight the utility of DDM and the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 to solubilize and refold the beta-barrel OmpT into a functionally active conformation.",
                        "To further emphasize the general utility of OGDs for the purification of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins, we also attempted to extract the beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) from membranes using DDM as well as the [G1] and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1 and 4. The BAM complex is responsible for the folding and insertion of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and consists of five subunits, including BamA, BamB, BamC, BamD, and BamE28. Higher relative protein quantities were obtained upon extraction with DDM and the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Only BamE was overexpressed with a polyhistidine tag. The finding that all five subunits were co-purified during IMAC therefore underlines that DDM and the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 can extract not only large quantities of the BAM complex, but also preserve subunit interactions during purification. This is an important perquisite for structural studies (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05).",
                        "Taken together, OGDs enable the extraction of membrane proteins from cell membranes and also the refolding of membrane proteins. OGD batches containing smaller head groups, such as [G1] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1\u20132, led to higher protein quantities than OGD batches with larger head groups, such as [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 3\u20135. Furthermore, protein quantities obtained among [G2] OGD batches vary with the structure of the hydrophobic tail. Among [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 3\u20135, higher relative protein quantities were obtained when lipid-like tails were used. Our data indicate that the structural impact of OGD head groups and tails on protein purification can be extrapolated to alpha-helical and beta-barrel proteins. This leads us to the conclusion that tuning (i) the heterogeneity of the OGD batches and (ii) the structure of the OGD head and tail; are key parameters for optimizing the observable protein yields upon isolation under the experimental conditions employed."

                        "While establishing the utility of OGDs for protein purification, we found that [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures are less effective in isolating proteins from cell membranes than [G1] OGD regioisomer mixtures. This is in line with our hypothesis that increasing the size of the detergent head group decreases the detergent\u2019s ability to break lipid\u2013lipid and protein\u2013lipid interactions in membranes4. We therefore anticipate that tuning the structure of the OGD head and tail will not only control the obtainable protein yields, but also the ability to preserve protein interactions with native membrane lipids during isolation. These interactions can be probed using native MS since it enables individual protein\u2013lipid binding events to be captured upon removal of detergents from the proteomicelle inside a mass spectrometer25,29,30. However, detergents that promote lipid co-purification, and maintain subunit interactions, are often difficult to remove from proteomicelles and vice versa31. As a consequence, detergents that enable both preservation of subunit interactions and easy detergent removal are not common.",
                        "With the aim of combining these two important features, we analyzed a series of bacterial membrane protein complexes that were extracted with the OGD batches 1\u20135 using a modified Q Exactive MS instrument18. The mass spectra obtained following the isolation of AqpZ with [G1] OGD batches revealed a well-resolved tetrameric complex in its apo form (Fig.\u00a02c). Therefore, we conclude that the oligomeric state of AqpZ was retained during isolation. In the lower mass range of the spectrum AqpZ dimers of lower intensity were observed (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). This suggests that OGDs are also capable of solubilizing partially assembled states of oligomeric AqpZ. Such partial assemblies are commonly removed by using further purification techniques, such as size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)32. Mass spectra obtained from other bacterial membrane proteins, such as AmtB, MATE, OmpT, and OmpF, show exclusively the expected oligomeric states (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02, 7\u201310, 14, and 15). In summary, our MS data highlight the utility of OGDs to preserve native oligomeric states of membrane proteins during purification.",
                        "Interestingly, poorly-resolved and broad charge state distributions were obtained for AqpZ upon extraction with individual [G1] OGD regioisomers 2a and 2b (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). Apparently, the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 2 (=2a\u2009+\u20092b) is more suitable for the extraction and subsequent MS analysis of AqpZ than the individual [G1] OGD regioisomers 2a and 2b. As mentioned before in the case of AmtB, differences in extraction efficiency between 2, 2a, and 2b were less pronounced. For all three OGD batches, mass spectra of comparable quality were obtained for AmtB (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). This demonstrates that the utility of OGDs for protein extraction is not necessarily limited to their regioisomer mixtures. If the targeted protein is sufficiently stable, individual OGD regioisomers can also be used for the purification and native MS analysis of membrane proteins. The ability to optimize the performance of OGDs for protein purification by changing the regioisomer ratios depends on the targeted protein.",
                        "From the [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 3, poor quality spectra and low yields were obtained, implying that the combination of a linear C18 alkyl chain and a [G2] head group is less suitable for protein isolation from cell membranes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). In contrast, the combination of [G2] and lipid-like hydrophobic tails, e.g. 4 and 5, gave rise to mass spectra assigned to lipid-bound states of tetrameric AqpZ complexes (Fig.\u00a02c). The lipid masses agree well with those of cardiolipins (CDL) and phospholipids (PL) (Supplementary Table 2). These lipids were co-purified from cell membranes and are relevant for the structure and function of AqpZ25,30. We found similar trends in lipid preservation for AmtB and MATE. In contrast, MS spectra obtained from proteins that were purified with [G1] OGDs revealed a lower abundance of lipid-bound states (Fig.\u00a02c, Supplementary Figs.\u00a02, 10, 11). We conclude that tuning the structure of the OGD head group and tail enables control over the preservation of protein interactions with endogenous membrane lipids during protein isolation from cell membranes.",
                        "Furthermore, we investigated the stability of MATE-GFP and AqpZ-GFP against precipitation in MS buffer containing DDM, [G1] regioisomer mixture 1, or [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4. The stabilities of both proteins against precipitation in MS buffer were similar in all three detergent environments (Supplementary Fig.\u00a012). Moreover, the isolated proteins were stable in solution and could be analyzed by native MS even after multiple freeze-thaw cycles. This further emphasizes the general utility of OGDs for the structural analysis of membrane proteins."

                        "Having established the utility of OGDs for protein purification and preservation of protein interactions with native membrane lipids during isolation, we evaluated their impact on the properties of native mass spectra. In contrast to the reference detergent DDM, resolved charge states were obtained for every membrane protein tested when OGDs were used during purification. This confirms that harsher activation conditions are needed to remove DDM from proteomicelles and shows that OGDs are removed more readily (Supplementary Fig.\u00a013)31.",
                        "To investigate charge-reducing properties of OGDs, we selected OmpF as model protein. We found that the average charge state (zave) of OmpF obtained upon MS analysis with [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 (19+) is similar to that of n-octyl-\u00df-d-glucoside (19+), a detergent that is not associated with charge reduction (Fig.\u00a03a, Supplementary Figs.\u00a014 and 19)31. Further analysis of a mass spectrum obtained from OmpT upon purification with the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 supported this conclusion. The zave of OmpT obtained after purification with 1 (11+) is similar to the most abundant protein charge state obtained from DDM (10+)33, a detergent that is also not associated with charge reduction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a015)31.Fig. 3OGDs control membrane protein charge reduction.a, b Mass spectra of trimeric OmpF were obtained upon detergent exchange from n-octyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside to [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 and [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 2. A substitution of the ether moiety in 1 by the more basic triazole in 2 leads to a substantial charge reduction of OmpF. Spectra were acquired using comparable instrument conditions (HCD energy: 200\u2009V). Trimeric OmpT is indicated by beige symbols.",
                        "In contrast, a significant reduction in zave of OmpF from 19+ to 15+ is found when the ether linkage of 1 was substituted for a triazole unit in 2 (Fig.\u00a03b). This charge reduction is expected because the ability of the linker to abstract charges (mainly protons) from protein ions is directly related to its basicity23. The zave obtained from the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 2 (15+) was lower than the value obtained from the charge-reducing detergent C8E4 (17.5+, Supplementary Figs.\u00a014 and 16). Further experiments on the individual [G1] OGD regioisomers 2a, 2b, and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 3 confirmed that protein charge reduction depends exclusively on the basicity of the OGD linker (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). Furthermore, the mass spectra obtained from AqpZ and AmtB upon isolation with the [G1] and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1\u20132 and 4\u20135 revealed that the ability to preserve lipid binding and protein charge reduction can be addressed individually, either by tuning the combination of head and tail or the choice of the linker, respectively (Supplementary Figs.\u00a010 and 11).",
                        "In general, low activation MS conditions and reduced protein charge states are favored when performing native MS. Both parameters help to preserve native structural features of membrane protein complexes, because they decrease the effect of Coulomb-driven protein unfolding during detergent removal inside the mass spectrometer20,34. Members of individual detergent families, such as saccharide, polyethylene glycol, or amine N-oxide detergents, are either suitable for protein purification, promote charge reduction, or preserve protein\u2013lipid interactions during protein purification31. Individually, all of these properties are important, but no detergent to date embodies all of these desirable characteristics. We conclude that the OGDs present an example of a detergent family that unites the desirable features of saccharide, polyethylene glycol, and amine N-oxide detergents.",
                        "An important question prompted by this study is related to the increase in relative intensities of protein\u2013lipid complexes detected by MS. Is this increase due to their stabilization in solution or in the gas phase? To answer this question we again focus on protein mass spectra obtained upon purification with [G1] and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1 and 4. The spectra obtained for tetrameric AqpZ, for example, show similar protein charge states (Fig.\u00a02c). Both detergents are not charge-reducing and the ionized protein-complexes experience similar collisional activation during detergent removal inside of the mass spectrometer31. Higher relative intensities of protein\u2013lipid complexes were detected when the [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4 was used. The [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4 exhibits larger head groups than mixture 1, as well as a more lipid-like tail (Fig.\u00a02c). Furthermore, protein mass spectra obtained from [G1] and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 2 and 5 confirm this observation. Both detergent batches reduce the charge of membrane proteins thus leading to lower energy collisional activation conditions within the HCD cell under the experimental conditions employed. However, protein\u2013lipid complexes were again only obtained upon purification with [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 5, which exhibits larger head groups and a more lipid-like tail (Supplementary Fig.\u00a011). This leads us to the conclusion that the increase in relative intensities of protein\u2013lipid complexes depend more on their stabilization by the proteomicelle in solution rather than on charge effects in the gas phase.",
                        "Detergents exhibit individual delipidation properties and protein delipidation can also change with the time that is used to expose membrane protein\u2013lipid complexes to detergents35,36. From our experience, detergents that co-purify substantial amounts of lipids are often not suitable for the straightforward MS analysis of membrane protein complexes. DDM, for example, is known to co-purify substantial amounts of lipids and requires harsh MS activation conditions to achieve sufficient detergent removal35,37, which can hamper the detection of intact membrane protein complexes by MS38. In practice, the investigation of protein\u2013lipid interaction by MS is addressed mainly in two ways: First, membrane proteins are delipidated step-wise with detergents that exhibit weak delipidating properties, such as DDM. To do so, protein\u2013lipid complexes are repetitively purified by SEC, IMAC, or dialysis until mass spectra of sufficient quality are obtained36,39. This allows us to investigate membrane proteins in complex with co-purified membrane lipids40. In the second approach, membrane proteins are purified with detergents that exhibit strong delipidating properties, such as C8E4, OG, or LDAO25,31. If the targeted protein is sufficiently stable after delipidation, individual lipids can be added back to the sample solution25,29. Subsequently, MS analysis, gas-phase unfolding protocols, or functional assays allow us to study how the molecular structure of individual lipids affects the structure and function of membrane proteins25,29,41,42.",
                        "In contrast to the above-mentioned methodologies, OGDs enable the straightforward analysis of interactions between membrane proteins and native membrane lipids directly after protein extraction and IMAC. Moreover, following our purification protocol, relative protein amounts and lipid binding interactions can be controlled practically by tuning the structure of the OGD head and tail (Fig.\u00a02c, Supplementary Figs.\u00a02, 10, and 11). This facilitates experimental access to either membrane proteins in complex with native membrane lipids or delipidated membrane proteins. In addition, OGDs can be readily removed from proteomicelles by collisional activation inside the mass spectrometer, which facilitates the MS analysis of membrane protein\u2013lipid complexes in general. Finally, protein charge reduction can be tuned by varying the basicity of the linker between OGD head and tail. The ability to optimize the structure of OGDs for the purification and native MS analysis of protein\u2013lipid interactions strengthens our anticipation that OGDs will facilitate the investigation of challenging membrane proteins in the future."

                        "Having established the utility of OGDs for membrane protein research and native MS, we focus on one of the most challenging protein families in structural biology: GPCRs. A recent breakthrough came with the demonstration that native MS has the potential to elucidate how post-translational modifications and lipid interactions affect the structure and function of GPCRs42,43. However, research on GPCRs remains generally challenging, partly because of the limited range of detergents that facilitate their purification and analysis44\u201346. Addressing this challenge, we extracted NTSR1 fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and thioredoxin (TrxA) from E. coli membranes. Mammalian membrane proteins, such as GPCRs, are more prone to denaturation in the presence of detergents than bacterial membrane proteins47. During our analysis, DDM was therefore again used as a reference for comparison with our best performing [G1] and [G2] OGD regioisomer mixtures 1 and 4.",
                        "Higher relative protein concentrations were obtained from the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1, which highlights its utility for extracting large GPCR quantities from biological membranes (Fig.\u00a04). Native MS experiments revealed reduced relative intensities of protein\u2013lipid complexes upon purification with the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 (Fig.\u00a04). Enhanced relative intensities of lipid complexes were observed in mass spectra following purification with [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4. Resolved mass spectra could not be obtained, however, following purification with DDM. This is in line with the results presented above for bacterial membrane proteins and underlines the utility of OGDs for tuning membrane protein and lipid co-purification under the experimental conditions employed.Fig. 4OGDs enable the purification of functional GPCRs.a Higher relative concentrations of MBP-NTSR1-TrxA were obtained upon extraction and IMAC with the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1. The Kd value of the complex is in the nanomolar range and similar to data reported from cell-based assays48. The [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 preserves functional characteristics of the receptor during purification. b, c Native MS analysis of MBP-NTSR1-TrxA upon solubilization from cell membranes and IMAC purification with [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 and [G2] regioisomer mixture OGD 4 show that the preservation of lipid binding can be controlled during purification by tuning the structure of the OGD head group and tail. Spectra were acquired using similar instrument conditions (HCD voltage: 200\u2009V). MBP-NTSR1-TrxA is indicated by blue circles and phospholipids are indicated by orange circles. Data are shown with standard deviation (\u00b1s.d., n\u2009=\u20093). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.",
                        "Subsequent proteolytic removal of the MBP and TrxA tags led to extensive precipitation of NTSR1 in case of the [G2] OGD regioisomer mixture 4. Only in the case of the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 and DDM it was possible to retain the solubility of NTSR1. To investigate the activity of NTSR1 in these detergents we used the chromophore-labeled agonist [5,6-FAM-NT(8-13)] and compared the results obtained in DDM and 1. We found that agonist binding to NTSR1 was closely similar in the presence of 1 and DDM under the chosen experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). Further affinity MS experiments revealed that the chromophore-labeled agonist binds strongly to NTSR1, when the protein was purified with the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1. The Kd value obtained from the NTSR1-agonist complex is in the nanomolar range and similar to data reported from cell-based assays (Fig.\u00a04)48. Fluorescence polarization experiments supported this result (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018). This underlines that the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 preserves functional characteristics of the receptor during purification49. Taken together, we conclude that the [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 enables not only the straightforward purification and native MS analysis of NTSR1, but also the investigation of functional GPCRs. In light of these results, we anticipate that this OGD will serve as an enabling step for structural biology research on GPCRs."

                "In summary, we have introduced a library of OGDs to structural biology, which enables the isolation of a broad range of membrane proteins and facilitates their subsequent native MS analysis. Furthermore, these detergents serve not only as an enabling step for the purification and analysis of bacterial membrane proteins but also for the particularly challenging class of GPCRs. None of the OGDs investigated here is universally suitable for all applications in membrane protein research. However, OGDs present an example of a detergent family whose molecular structures can be optimized for individual application in membrane protein research. This fine-tuning enables protein purification from membranes, preservation of lipid interactions during purification, refolding of membrane proteins, the facile MS analysis of membrane proteins and their lipid complexes, and confers protein charge reduction. Taken together, these attributes represent a significant step forward for the investigation of challenging membrane proteins and their interactions with native membrane lipids. Moreover, OGDs enable the purification of functional membrane proteins. In light of these findings, we anticipate that library-oriented detergent discovery of custom-made detergents for individual applications will be widely deployed in membrane protein research."

The derived count rate values obtained from three measurements (per concentration) were averaged and the logarithm of the derived count rate average was plotted against the logarithm of the OGD concentration. The double logarithmic plots showed two characteristic regions: (a) at flat region with low count rates at lower OGD concentrations and (b) a linear growth in the derived count rate at higher OGD concentrations. The individual regions were fitted to linear functions and the cac value was calculated from their intersection. The cac values are summarized in Supplementary Table\u00a03."

Instrumental parameters were as follows: injection flatapole (7.9\u2009V), inter flatapole lens (6.9\u2009V), bent flatapole (5.9\u2009V), transfer multipole (4\u2009V), capillary voltage (1.2\u2009kV), source temperature (100\u2013250\u2009\u00b0C), voltage applied to the C-trap entrance lens (5.8\u2009V), higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell voltage (200\u2009V), HCD cell pressure (9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221210\u2009mBar), noise level parameter (3), microscans (1\u201310), and resolution (17500). UniDec was used for background substraction and smoothing of recorded spectra53. Theoretical and experimental masses of detected species are summarized in Supplementary Table\u00a05. Data analsis was performed with Xcalibur V2.2 and Origin V9.1."

                        "NTSR1 purified in [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1 was buffer exchanged into binding buffer (10\u2009mM Hepes, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 2xcac of [G1] OGD regioisomer mixture 1, pH\u2009=\u20098) and incubated on ice with different concentrations of [5,6-FAM-NT(8-13)] (Caslo ApS, custom synthesis, peptide sequence: (5,6-FAM)-RRPYIL) ranging from 2\u2009nM to 250\u2009nM. The unbound peptide was separated using 75 \u00b5L Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting columns (MWCO = 7 kDa, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the protein bound to the labeled peptide was collected. The amount of peptide was determined using fluorescence polarization and affinity MS. Fluorescence measurements were made using a PHERAstar FSX (BMG Labtech) microplate reader and the data were analyzed using PHERAstar FSX Mars data analysis software. For affinity MS, a system composed of a Vanquish\u2122 Flex Quaternary UHPLC quaternary pump, a Vanquish\u2122 Split Sampler, and a Q Exactive\u2122 Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used. An Accucore\u2122 biphenyl reversed-phase analytical column (2.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009100\u2009mm, 2.6\u2009\u03bcm) was used as stationary phase. The flow rate was set to 200\u2009\u03bcL/min and the column temperature was set to 40\u2009\u00b0C. Buffer A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (methanol with 0.2% acetic acid) were used as mobile phases. The gradient was programmed as follows: 0\u20130.15\u2009min, 10% B; 0.15\u20133.5\u2009min, 10\u201395% B; 3.5\u20134.25\u2009min, 95% B and 4.25\u20134.3\u2009min, 10% B with a final run time of five minutes. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated in positive polarity and the ionization conditions were as follows: capillary temperature (250\u2009\u00b0C), vaporizer temperature (250\u2009\u00b0C), spray voltage (3.5\u2009kV), auxiliary gas pressure (10 arbitrary units) and sheath gas pressure (45 arbitrary units). Peptides were detected using data-dependent acquisition mode in which the five most intense precursor ions from a full MS scan were selected for fragmentation by collision induced dissociation (CID). Full MS scans were performed with a resolution of 70,000 at 200\u2009m/z. The m/z range was set to 400\u20131300. The normalized CID collision energy was 35% for a doubly charged precursor ion. The isolation width was set to 2\u2009m/z and the activation time to 10\u2009ms. MS data were analyzed using TraceFinder\u2122. MS and fluorescence intensities were normalized and plotted against the concentration. The data were fitted to a one-site binding model in order to obtain Kd values (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018)."
