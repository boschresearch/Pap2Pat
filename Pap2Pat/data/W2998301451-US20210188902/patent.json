                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Membrane proteins are responsible for a wide range of biological functions. Some of the most prevalent human diseases, including some cancers, result from their dysfunction. Despite representing around a third of the human genome, membrane proteins represent targets for more than half of all current therapeutic agents.",
                        "Membrane proteins have large hydrophobic surface regions and are known to be difficult to handle in solution upon extraction from the native lipid bilayer environment. Their extraction is usually achieved by amphiphilic molecules such as detergents, which comprise a hydrophilic (water-soluble) and a hydrophobic (water-insoluble) portion. The bipolar character of amphiphiles is responsible for their ability to shield the hydrophobic surfaces of membrane proteins. This enables protein-detergent complexes to be stable in solution upon removal of the membrane environment, which is crucial for the analysis of their structure by biophysical techniques.",
                        "As a significant biological target in disease and cancer, their study by traditional structural biology approaches, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, has been frustrated by limitations relating to their expression and solubility. Furthermore, X-ray analysis, in the majority of cases, has been limited by crystallographic resolution hindering the assignment of bound moieties.",
                        "In contrast to classical structural biology methods, mass spectrometry (MS) of intact complexes, sometimes referred to as \u201cnative MS\u201d, is a rapid and sensitive technique that can provide invaluable information on protein complexes, such as specifically bound small molecules. MS of intact soluble membrane proteins has emerged as a powerful technique to study the stoichiometry, structure-function and dynamics of protein assemblies. The technique has also been used to study membrane protein complexes, where it has already revealed subunit stoichiometries and specific phospholipid interactions.",
                        "Membrane protein MS is normally performed using a detergent micelle in which the protein is contained. The membrane protein may be prepared by buffer exchange of the purified protein into an MS-compatible buffer supplemented with the detergent. The micellar solution is then ionized by means of nanoelectrospray and transmission into the mass spectrometer.",
                        "Detergents that are suitable for native MS ideally maintain the structure of a chosen membrane protein in solution, are tolerated by nESI and provide the ability to obtain a mass spectrum of a membrane protein. Chemical properties of a detergent are important for the gas phase properties of membrane protein ions monitored by MS techniques since they can affect: i) the ease of the detergent removal in the gas phase, ii) average charge state (zave) of the protein in the gas phase upon detergent removal and iii) the ability to detect ligands such as lipids bound to membrane protein complexes.",
                        "Non-ionic detergent families are often used to form micellar solutions for use in MS, as high concentrations of non-ionic detergents can be tolerated more readily during the electrospray process. Saccharide detergents are a family of non-ionic detergents. Glucoside and maltoside detergents, such as octyl \u00df-D-glucopyranosid, n-decyl \u00df-D-maltoside and n-dodecyl \u00df-D-maltoside, are commonly used in structural biology and can maintain folded states of membrane proteins upon extraction in solution, and so they are considered as detergents that provide commonly a \u201csoft\u201d solution environment for membrane proteins. Whilst these detergents are compatible with nESI, the energy required for the removal of saccharide detergents in the gas phase and the zave of the delivered membrane protein ions are comparatively high. This causes commonly unintended unfolding or dissociation of the protein structure. Saccharide detergents are therefore commonly designated as \u201charsh\u201d in terms of the gas-phase conditions applied to achieve the detergent removal.",
                        "Other non-ionic detergents such as polyoxyethylene glycols have also been used in MS techniques, as well as some zwitteronic detergents. Polyethylenglycol and amine oxide detergents, such as tetraethylene glycol monooctyl ether or lauryldimethylamine N-oxide, have charge reducing properties resulting in low zave enabling them to be removed at lower activation energies compared to saccharide detergents. However, the solution environment of these detergents is considered \u201charsh\u201d for proteins. This means that ligands may dissociate from a protein, including lipids which can be crucial from preserving the native protein structure.",
                        "There exists a need for a detergent family which may be used for extracting and stabilising membrane proteins in solution, but which may also be used for carrying out MS methods for detecting proteins, i.e. a detergent family which can provide both a \u201csoft\u201d solution environment and a \u201csoft\u201d gas-phase environment. There is also a need for a detergent family whose properties can be fine-tuned, for instance to enable proteins to be extracted and analysed using MS in an unbound (apo) state or in a ligand-bound state, and/or to enable the gas-phase charge state of the protein to be controlled."

Thus, the branched alkyl group may contain from 1 in 6 to 1 in 2, and more preferably from 1 in 4 to 2 in 5 carbon atoms replaced with an oxygen or nitrogen.

A second generation dendritic detergent may be used in the form of a mixture of dendritic detergents having head groups which represent at least 3 regioisomers of one another.

If desired, these may then be separated by chromatography into individual regioisomers (see FIG. 12). Alternatively, individual acetal-protected regioisomers may be prepared synthetically, e.g. using the scheme depicted in FIG. 13. Subsequent generations of dendritic head group may be prepared by reacting acetal-protected first generation head groups, [pG1]-OH, with a reagent, e.g. methallyl dichloride. Acetal protecting groups may be removed using conventional deprotection methods.

Protoc., 2008, 3, 784-798 describe a GFP fusion construct methodology in which yields in the overexpression and purification of membrane proteins are improved, while Aller et al., Science, 2009, 323, 1718-1722 describe P-glycoprotein expression and purification. Reference may also be made to Zhang et al., Nature, 2015, 520, 317. Proteins may also be commercially available. In order to produce high quality mass spectra, the protein should preferably be relatively pure and homogenous, equivalent to crystallographic-grade material.",

The therapeutic agent may be an active compound which, when administered to an organism (human or non-human animal), induces a desired pharmacologic, immunogenic, and/or physiologic effect by local and/or systemic action. Examples of therapeutic agents include, without limitation, drugs, vaccines and biopharmaceutical agents. Thus, therapeutic agents may include small molecule drugs, therapeutic proteins, peptides and fragments thereof (whether naturally occurring, chemically synthesised or recombinantly produced), and nucleic acid molecules (including both double-and single-stranded molecules, gene constructs, expression vectors, antisense molecules and the like).

Many other therapeutic agents are known in the art and may be utilised in a method of the present invention. A detailed description of various therapeutic agents may be found in e.g. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (21st edition, 2005, Mack Publishing Company).

In particular, a method may be used to screen for the binding of activators and transporter substrates which are difficult to screen using conventional in vivo methodologies. Moreover, unlike X-ray crystallography, the present methods are not complicated by the inherent structural flexibility of protein-therapeutic agent complexes and may allow the dynamical behaviour of proteins and their interaction with therapeutic agents to be studied.",

Alkali metal contaminants are often found in commercial protein batches. This is because they are a common component of salts that are used in protein purification buffers, e.g. sodium chloride, and proteins are often not quantitatively desalted after purification.",

Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the aggregate may shield the protein during the droplet phase of the electrospray ionisation process and, moreover, may afford at least partial shielding from ionisation of the protein during this process. The detergent aggregate may exert a pressure sufficient to maintain the structure of the protein, thereby minimising the deleterious effects associated with vaporisation and substantially retaining interactions between the protein and any ligand as well as interactions within any subunits of the protein.",

Chem. 1996, 68, 1-8; and Wilm et al, Int. J. of Mass Spec. and Ion Proc. 1994, 132, 167-180). The use of nanoelectrospray ionisation allows ions, and in particular highly charged ions, to be generated directly from solution. The formation of highly charged ions may allow the detection of high mass complexes at relatively low mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The use of a nanoelectrospray ionisation is also desirable from the point of view of allowing a protein complex, or subunits of a complex, to remain substantially intact.

                                "This method involves providing a membrane protein in its native membrane. It is well-understood in the art that native membranes are those membranes in an organism in which the membrane protein is present.",
                                "The step of providing a membrane protein in its native environment may comprise expressing the membrane protein in an organism. In embodiments, the method may comprise overexpression a membrane protein in an organism, for instance by introducing gene vectors for overexpression of the membrane protein into the organism. Typically bacteria such as E. coli will be used. Mammalian cell lines (e.g. 293T), insect cells and yeast may also be used. Methods in which membrane proteins are overexpressed are known in the art and are described e.g. in Laganowsky et al., Nat. Protoc. 2013, 8, 639-651 (see also Drew et al., Nat. Protoc. 2008, 3, 784-798).",

The cells may be then lysed, e.g. using a lysis buffer, to provide a lysate. Suitable lysis buffers may comprise tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (\u2018Tris\u2019, e.g. about 20 mM). Other components in the lysis buffer may include NaCl (e.g. about 300 mM). The pH of the lysis buffer may be from about 7 to about 8, e.g. 7.4. In preferred embodiments, then lysate will be homogenised, e.g. by being passed through a microfluidizer, and insoluble material removed by centrifugation.",
                                "The lysed membranes may be suspended in a buffer. Suitable buffers include Tris (e.g. about 20 mM). Other components in the buffer may include NaCl (e.g. about 100 mM) and/or glycerol (e.g. 0.2 v/v). The suspension may be homogenised, e.g. using a pestle and glass tube.",

The dendritic detergent extracts the membrane protein from its native membrane and forms a detergent aggregate in which the membrane protein is contained. The dendritic detergents of the present invention may extract high levels of membrane protein, whilst advantageously maintaining the membrane protein in an intact, folded state.",

In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the detergent to the membrane protein is less than or equal to 100:1.",

In an embodiment, the protein is present in the solution at a concentration of from about 1 nM to about 1 mM, e.g. from about 800 nM to about 900 nM.",

The membrane protein and detergent mixture may be gently agitated during this period. The protein and dendritic detergent may be contacted under cooling conditions, e.g. at a temperature of lower than 15\u00b0 C., preferably lower than 10\u00b0 C., such as at 4\u00b0 C.",

                                "In some embodiments, the method of extracting a membrane protein from its native membrane may further comprise purifying the extracted membrane protein. For instance, the membrane protein may be purified using chromatography methods. Chromatography methods are believed to separate different membrane proteins that may be present in a cell membrane, as well as other components such as lipids. The membrane protein preferably remains contained within the dendritic detergent aggregate during chromatography.",
                                "Immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) is particularly suitable for purifying membrane proteins, though gel-filtration chromatography (also known as size-exclusion chromatography) and amylose affinity chromatography may also be used. Further purification methods include dialysis."

Tandem mass spectrometry focusing on the most abundant protein charge state 8+ was used to study dissociation behaviour of the sodiated BLG PDCs. The width of the isolated m/z channel 25 was varied by using either high resolution or low resolution settings. For reference, the same experiment was carried out in the presence of the detergent n dodecyl \u00df-D-maltoside (DDM) which is commonly used in native mass spectrometry.

The extent of charge reduction upon complex dissociation was proportional to the relative amount of sodium within the PDC. This also suggests that dendritic detergent molecules that do not capture a sodium cation are dissociated from the complex as neutral species. Notably, no charge reduction of BLG is observed where DDM is used. Since DDM and the dendritic detergent in batch 1 exhibit similar alkyl spacers and linker groups, but differ in the structure of their head groups, the triglycerol head groups of the detergents in batch 1 are most likely the major coordination sites for sodium ions.
