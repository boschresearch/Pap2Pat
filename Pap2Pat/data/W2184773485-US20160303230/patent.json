                        "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are artificial molecules that redirect the specificity of T cells to predetermined antigens (Pule et al., 2003). Prototypic single chain CARs were first described in a study by Eshhar and colleagues in 1993, in which specific activation and targeting of T cells was mediated through molecules consisting of a target-antigen-specific antibody domain and the \u03b3- or \u03b6-signaling subunits of the Fc epsilon receptor or T-cell receptor CD3 complex, respectively (Pule et al., 2003; Eshhar et al., 1993). Since then, many groups have devised CAR molecules with single tumor-directed specificities and enhanced signaling endodomains (Ahmed et al., 2007; Brentjens et al., 2003; Pule et al., 2004; Savoldo et al., 2007); CAR T cell-based clinical trials are currently underway, with early results being highly promising (Dotti et al., 2009; Pule et al., 2008; Kalos et al., 2011; Porter et al., 2011; Study of Administration of CMV-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Expressing CAR Targeting HER2 I Patients with GBM, 2011; Her2 and TGFBeta in Treatment of Her2 Positive Lung Malignancy, 2011).",
                        "Rendering an individual T cell bispecific could have substantial functional implications that would likely translate into major therapeutic benefits. Down-regulation or mutation of target antigens is commonly observed in cancer cells, creating antigen loss escape variants; a bispecific T cell could thus offset tumor escape (Dunn et al., 2004). Furthermore, this bi-specificity could enable simultaneous targeting of tumor cells and elements in the tumor microenvironment thereby augmenting T-cell activation and function by increasing avidity and by broadening their therapeutic reach (Weijtens et al., 2000). To accomplish such bispecificity, the inventors constructed a CAR in which two distinct antigen recognition domains are present in tandem on a single transgenic receptor.",
                        "The folding of an amino acid chain into highly organized, biologically functional three-dimensional protein structures, such as a CAR, continues to be a challenge in the design of novel protein molecules (Buchner et al., 2011). In particular, protein misfolding, mispairing and malfunction/dysfunction, have traditionally impeded attempts at production of molecules with multiple specificities (Kuhlman and Baker, 2004). Advances in computational modeling methods, through characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains, have made structure prediction, analysis and design of a novel protein molecule, such as a tandem CAR, more feasible (Park et al., 2004; Perez-Aguilar and Saven, 2012; Samish et al., 2011). Furthermore, docking routines have recently made it possible to predict, with high accuracy, the interface between two candidate molecules in a manner that could help to elucidate their functionality (Wodak, 2007; Kiel et al., 2008).",
                        "The inventors used computational modeling tools to guide the design and construction of a novel single CAR molecule that can mediate bispecific activation and targeting of T cells. This tandem CAR (TanCAR), recognizes each target molecule individually, and facilitates synergistic activation and functionality when both are encountered simultaneously. Thus, the present invention provides important therapeutic advances in the art."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The present invention is directed to methods and compositions related to improved immunogenic therapeutic compositions that comprise chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). The present invention is directed to methods and compositions related to cell therapy. In particular embodiments, the cell therapy is for an individual in need of cell therapy, such as a mammal, including a human. The cell therapy may be suitable for any medical condition, although in specific embodiments the cell therapy is for cancer, including cancer having solid tumors.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the cancer may be of any kind and of any stage. The individual may be of any age or either gender. In specific embodiments, the individual is known to have cancer, is at risk for having cancer, or is suspected of having cancer. The cancer may be a primary or metastatic cancer, and the cancer may be refractory to treatment. In specific embodiments, the cancer is leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, breast, lung, brain, colon, kidney, prostate, pancreatic, thyroid, bone, cervical, spleen, anal, esophageal, head and neck, stomach, gall bladder, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and so forth, for example, such as various types of primary and secondary brain and liver cancers. In particular aspects, the cancer expresses one or more tumor antigens, although upon identification of a type of cancer in an individual, the presence of the particular tumor antigen(s) may or may not be verified.",
                        "In certain embodiments of the invention, the invention concerns methods and compositions related to therapeutic cells, including therapeutic immune system cells such as tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The cells may be NK cells or NKT cells, in some cases, however, other cellular elements with the capability of inducing an effector immune response are encompassed in the invention. The cells express at least one non-endogenous receptor that targets two or more particular tumor antigens, and in at least some cases, the receptor comprises a scFv.",
                        "Embodiments of the invention include a tandem chimeric antigen receptor that mediates bispecific activation and targeting of T cells. Although the present disclosure refers to bispecificity for the CAR, in some cases the CARs are able to target three, four, or more tumor antigens. Given that single agents in cancer therapy fail to cure tumors while multiple agents achieve substantial responses (or cure), targeting multiple antigens using CAR T cells of the present invention results in (1) enhanced T cell activation, (2) effectively offsetting tumor escape by antigen loss, and (3) enhancing tumor control by capturing more tumor bulk and a collective action of the above former two effects.",
                        "In certain aspects to the invention, there are bispecific tandem chimeric antigen receptor (TanCAR) that includes two targeting domains. In certain aspects to the invention, there is multispecific tandem chimeric antigen receptor (TanCAR) that includes three or more targeting domains. TanCARs of the invention augment T-cell activation and function by increasing avidity and by broadening their therapeutic reach. This allows for (1) targeting multiple modestly expressed antigens, (2) targeting various tumors using the same cellular product that has a broad specificity and allows for (3) better toxicity profile because a less intensely signaling CAR could achieve the same results by virtue of multiple specificity.",
                        "The TanCAR of the present invention may target two or more tumor antigens of any kind. Exemplary tumor antigens include one or more of CD19, CD20, CD22, k light chain, CD30, CD33, CD123, CD38, ROR1, ErbB2, ErbB3/4, EGFr vIII, carcinoembryonic antigen, EGP2, EGP40, mesothelin, TAG72, PSMA, NKG2D ligands, B7-H6, IL-13 receptor \u03b1 2, MUC1, MUC16, CA9, GD2, GD3, HMW-MAA, CD171, Lewis Y, G250/CAIX, HLA-AI MAGE A1, HLA-A2 NY-ESO-1, PSC1, folate receptor-\u03b1, CD44v7/8, 8H9, NCAM, VEGF receptors, 5T4, Fetal AchR, NKG2D ligands, CD44v6, TEM1, and/or TEM8.",

                        "In certain embodiments, there is targeting of the tumor complex, wherein multi-specificity enables simultaneous targeting of tumor cells and elements in the tumor microenvironment. In specific aspects such a composition includes a HER2 and VEGF-A specific TanCAR, for example. In some embodiments, Tem8 and/or FAP are targeted in the invention and, therefore have TanCARs with one or both of them.",

Malignancies are complex diseases where multiple elements contribute to the overall pathogenesis through both distinct and redundant mechanisms. Hence, targeting different cancer-specific markers simultaneously could result in better therapeutic efficacy. However, developing two separate cellular products for clinical use as combination therapy is impractical, owing to regulatory hurdles and cost.",
                        "In contrast, rendering an individual T cell bispecific could increase target cell selectivity, improve T-cell activation and offset tumor escape because of antigen loss. Here, the present invention provides a generally applicable approach in which T cells have been modified to express a novel tandem chimeric antigen receptor (TanCAR) that can distinctly recognize two tumor antigens simultaneously.",
                        "In specific embodiments, the design of the TanCAR was guided by systematic computational modeling and incorporates, in tandem, two single chain antibody variable fragments (scFv) tethered to a hinge, and transmembrane and signaling domains. Engagement of TanCAR by cognate ligands induced activation of T cells, which had effector activity against individual target antigens, and synergistic enhancement of functionality upon simultaneous ligation of both components. Antitumoral activity of TanCAR T cells was observed in an animal tumor model, demonstrating their utility for therapeutic application in human disease.",
                        "Thus, embodiments of the invention utilize a TanCAR as an artificial molecule that enables immune cells (T cells) to specifically and distinctly recognize and attack two cancer target molecules simultaneously. The CAR, is an artificial molecule that can be grafted onto T cells using genetic engineering technology to render them specific to a target of interest. The prototype such molecule consisted of two parts: one that projects outside the T cell to engage its target and the other extends inside it and is responsible for activation of the T cell killing machinery upon target engagement. The TanCAR, or Tandem Chimeric Antigen Receptor, has not one but two recognition domains, in tandem, projecting outside the T cells enabling a single T cell to recognize two molecules and attack them simultaneously.",
                        "TanCAR-grafted T cells by virtue of their duality are able to identify a) multiple cells expressing these target molecules and/or b) multiple target molecules on the same cell. This ability has substantial therapeutic implications. Growing evidence indicates that cancer cells can only live and grow if they succeed in creating congenial soil referred to as the tumor microenvironment. Cellular elements of the tumor microenvironment secrete tumor promoting factors that maintain such soil. Embodiments of the invention incude a TanCAR molecule to simultaneously target VEGF-A, a vascular growth factor that is expressed by various cellular components of the tumor microenvironment and the previously validated cancer target HER2. A HER2/VEGF-A TanCAR molecule would have wide applicability, because these targets are expressed on various tumors (HER2 is expressed in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, brain cancer, sarcomas and lung cancer; VEGF-A is targeted in brain, lung and colorectal cancer) and one can generate TanCAR T cells on a platform that, while personalized, is broadly applicable to various patient tissue types. In certain embodiments of the invention, combination therapy is employed with the invention, wherein other cancer treatments are provided to the individuals receiving the TanCAR therapy. For example, one can also target HER2 with trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and VEGF-A targeting agents, namely becizumab (Avastin\u00ae) and other cell therapy products and vaccines. The present invention also provides an advantage for the proposed product over conventional adjuvant agents given that the increasingly aging population has demanded a substantial shift towards low toxicity, targeted, QOL-favorable agents.",

In certain aspects the antibody is directed at multiple target antigens on the cell surface of cancer cells, for example, although in some cases the target antigen is a secreted molecule from a cell and is not membrane-bound. In certain embodiments, a cytoplasmic signaling domain, such as those derived from the T cell receptor \u03b6-chain, is employed as at least part of the chimeric receptor in order to produce stimulatory signals for T lymphocyte proliferation and effector function following engagement of the chimeric receptor with the target antigen.

Expression vectors can contain a variety of \u201ccontrol sequences,\u201d which refer to nucleic acid sequences necessary for the transcription and possibly translation of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host cell.

The phrases \u201coperatively positioned,\u201d \u201coperatively linked,\u201d \u201cunder control,\u201d and \u201cunder transcriptional control\u201d mean that a promoter is in a correct functional location and/or orientation in relation to a nucleic acid sequence to control transcriptional initiation and/or expression of that sequence.",
                                "A promoter generally comprises a sequence that functions to position the start site for RNA synthesis. The best known example of this is the TATA box, but in some promoters lacking a TATA box, such as, for example, the promoter for the mammalian terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene and the promoter for the SV40 late genes, a discrete element overlying the start site itself helps to fix the place of initiation. Additional promoter elements regulate the frequency of transcriptional initiation. Typically, these are located in the region 30 110 bp upstream of the start site, although a number of promoters have been shown to contain functional elements downstream of the start site as well. To bring a coding sequence \u201cunder the control of\u201d a promoter, one positions the 5\u2032 end of the transcription initiation site of the transcriptional reading frame \u201cdownstream\u201d of (i.e., 3\u2032 of) the chosen promoter.

Such a promoter can be referred to as \u201cendogenous.\u201d Similarly, an enhancer may be one naturally associated with a nucleic acid sequence, located either downstream or upstream of that sequence. Alternatively, certain advantages will be gained by positioning the coding nucleic acid segment under the control of a recombinant or heterologous promoter, which refers to a promoter that is not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural environment. A recombinant or heterologous enhancer refers also to an enhancer not normally associated with a nucleic acid sequence in its natural environment.

Adeno associated virus (AAV) is an attractive vector system for use in the cells of the present invention as it has a high frequency of integration and it can infect nondividing cells, thus making it useful for delivery of genes into mammalian cells, for example, in tissue culture (Muzyczka, 1992) or in vivo. AAV has a broad host range for infectivity (Tratschin et al., 1984; Laughlin et al., 1986; Lebkowski et al., 1988; McLaughlin et al., 1988).

In order to produce virions, a packaging cell line containing the gag, pol, and env genes but without the LTR and packaging components is constructed (Mann et al., 1983). When a recombinant plasmid containing a cDNA, together with the retroviral LTR and packaging sequences is introduced into a special cell line (e.g., by calcium phosphate precipitation for example), the packaging sequence allows the RNA transcript of the recombinant plasmid to be packaged into viral particles, which are then secreted into the culture media (Nicolas and Rubenstein, 1988; Temin, 1986; Mann et al., 1983). The media containing the recombinant retroviruses is then collected, optionally concentrated, and used for gene transfer. Retroviral vectors are able to infect a broad variety of cell types. However, integration and stable expression require the division of host cells (Paskind et al., 1975).",

Some examples of lentivirus include the Human Immunodeficiency Viruses: HIV-1, HIV-2 and the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus: SIV. Lentiviral vectors have been generated by multiply attenuating the HIV virulence genes, for example, the genes env, vif, vpr, vpu and nef are deleted making the vector biologically safe.",

No. 5,994,136, incorporated herein by reference. One may target the recombinant virus by linkage of the envelope protein with an antibody or a particular ligand for targeting to a receptor of a particular cell-type.

An \u201canti-cancer\u201d agent is capable of negatively affecting cancer in a subject, for example, by killing cancer cells, inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, reducing the growth rate of cancer cells, reducing the incidence or number of metastases, reducing tumor size, inhibiting tumor growth, reducing the blood supply to a tumor or cancer cells, promoting an immune response against cancer cells or a tumor, preventing or inhibiting the progression of cancer, or increasing the lifespan of a subject with cancer. More generally, these other compositions would be provided in a combined amount effective to kill or inhibit proliferation of the cell. This process may involve contacting the cancer cells with the expression construct and the agent(s) or multiple factor(s) at the same time. This may be achieved by contacting the cell with a single composition or pharmacological formulation that includes both agents, or by contacting the cell with two distinct compositions or formulations, at the same time, wherein one composition includes the expression construct and the other includes the second agent(s).",
                                "Tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy agents represents a major problem in clinical oncology. One goal of current cancer research is to find ways to improve the efficacy of chemo- and radiotherapy by combining it with other therapies. In the context of the present invention, it is contemplated that cell therapy could be used similarly in conjunction with chemotherapeutic, radiotherapeutic, or immunotherapeutic intervention, as well as pro-apoptotic or cell cycle regulating agents.",
                                "Alternatively, the present inventive therapy may precede or follow the other agent treatment by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the other agent and present invention are applied separately to the individual, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the agent and inventive therapy would still be able to exert an advantageously combined effect on the cell. In such instances, it is contemplated that one may contact the cell with both modalities within about 12-24 h of each other and, more preferably, within about 6-12 h of each other. In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, however, where several d (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several wk (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations.",

Other forms of DNA damaging factors are also contemplated such as microwaves and UV-irradiation. It is most likely that all of these factors effect a broad range of damage on DNA, on the precursors of DNA, on the replication and repair of DNA, and on the assembly and maintenance of chromosomes. Dosage ranges for X-rays range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time (3 to 4 wk), to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosage ranges for radioisotopes vary widely, and depend on the half-life of the isotope, the strength and type of radiation emitted, and the uptake by the neoplastic cells.",

To achieve cell killing or stasis, both agents are delivered to a cell in a combined amount effective to kill the cell or prevent it from dividing.",

                                "Immunotherapeutics generally rely on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. The immune effector may be, for example, an antibody specific for some marker on the surface of a tumor cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to actually effect cell killing. The antibody also may be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and serve merely as a targeting agent. Alternatively, the effector may be a lymphocyte carrying a surface molecule that interacts, either directly or indirectly, with a tumor cell target. Various effector cells include cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.",
                                "Immunotherapy other than the inventive therapy described herein could thus be used as part of a combined therapy, in conjunction with the present cell therapy. The general approach for combined therapy is discussed below. Generally, the tumor cell must bear some marker that is amenable to targeting, i.e., is not present on the majority of other cells. Many tumor markers exist and any of these may be suitable for targeting in the context of the present invention. Common tumor markers include carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, urinary tumor associated antigen, fetal antigen, tyrosinase (p97), gp68, TAG-72, HMFG, Sialyl Lewis Antigen, MucA, MucB, PLAP, estrogen receptor, laminin receptor, erb B and p155.",

A variety of expression products are encompassed within the invention, including inducers of cellular proliferation, inhibitors of cellular proliferation, or regulators of programmed cell death.",

Curative surgery is a cancer treatment that may be used in conjunction with other therapies, such as the treatment of the present invention, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy and/or alternative therapies.",
                                "Curative surgery includes resection in which all or part of cancerous tissue is physically removed, excised, and/or destroyed. Tumor resection refers to physical removal of at least part of a tumor. In addition to tumor resection, treatment by surgery includes laser surgery, cryosurgery, electrosurgery, and miscopically controlled surgery (Mohs' surgery). It is further contemplated that the present invention may be used in conjunction with removal of superficial cancers, precancers, or incidental amounts of normal tissue.",
                                "Upon excision of part of all of cancerous cells, tissue, or tumor, a cavity may be formed in the body. Treatment may be accomplished by perfusion, direct injection or local application of the area with an additional anti-cancer therapy. Such treatment may be repeated, for example, every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, or every 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months. These treatments may be of varying dosages as well.",

                                "It is contemplated that other agents may be used in combination with the present invention to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment. These additional agents include immunomodulatory agents, agents that affect the upregulation of cell surface receptors and GAP junctions, cytostatic and differentiation agents, inhibitors of cell adhesion, or agents that increase the sensitivity of the hyperproliferative cells to apoptotic inducers. Immunomodulatory agents include tumor necrosis factor; interferon alpha, beta, and gamma; IL-2 and other cytokines; F42K and other cytokine analogs; or MIP-1, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, RANTES, and other chemokines. It is further contemplated that the upregulation of cell surface receptors or their ligands such as Fas/Fas ligand, DR4 or DR5/TRAIL would potentiate the apoptotic inducing abililties of the present invention by establishment of an autocrine or paracrine effect on hyperproliferative cells. Increases intercellular signaling by elevating the number of GAP junctions would increase the anti-hyperproliferative effects on the neighboring hyperproliferative cell population. In other embodiments, cytostatic or differentiation agents can be used in combination with the present invention to improve the anti-hyerproliferative efficacy of the treatments. Inhibitors of cell adhesion are contemplated to improve the efficacy of the present invention. Examples of cell adhesion inhibitors are focal adhesion kinase (FAKs) inhibitors and Lovastatin. It is further contemplated that other agents that increase the sensitivity of a hyperproliferative cell to apoptosis, such as the antibody c225, could be used in combination with the present invention to improve the treatment efficacy."

                                "Adoptive immunotherapy using activated and/or expanded CMV- or EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been successful in preventing malignant diseases associated with these viruses (Riddell et al., 1992; Walter et al., 1995; Rooney et al., 1998; Heslop et al., 1996). EBV-specific CTLs also had antitumor effects: none of the patient who received CTLs prophylactically developed lymphoma, in contrast to 11.5% of the controls (Rooney et al., 1998). Further, 11 of 13 patients who received CTLs as treatment for overt lymphoma achieved complete remissions (Gottschalk et al., 2005; Pakakasama et al., 2004; Gottschalk et al., 2001). The use of autologous EBV-specific CTLs has also been evaluated for patients with EBV-positive lymphomas and nasopharyngeal cancer with encouraging results (Straathof et al., 2005; Louis et al., 2008; Bollard et a., 2004). Beyond EBV-specific CTLs, autologous ex vivo expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or T-cell clones to melanoma patients have also produced significant antitumor effects (Yee et al., 2002; Dudley et al., 2005; udley et al., 2008; Rosenberg et al., 2008; Hunder et al., 2008). These results indicate the usability of banked off-the-shelf antigen-specific T cells for the treatment of cancer and infectious disease and the feasibility of its commercialization.",
                                "Genetically Engineered T cells: cell therapy by design. The broader use of antigen-specific CTLs for tumor therapy is currently limited by several factors, including 1) the reliable generation of tumor-specific T cells, 2) decreased MHC class I expression on tumor cells or defects in the antigen-processing machinery, 3) the presence of inhibitory T cells such as Th2 cells and/or Treg, at the tumor site, and 4) limited in vivo expansion of adoptively transferred T cells. One strategy to overcome many of these limitations is the genetic modification of T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs; FIG. 10). CARs provide T-cell activation in a non-MHC-restricted manner and therefore circumvent some of the major mechanisms by which tumors avoid MHC-restricted T-cell recognition, such as downregulation of HLA class I molecules and defects in antigen processing. Moreover, expressing CARs with multiple signaling domains in T cells renders them resistant to the inhibitory effects of regulatory Tregs (Loskog et al., 2004). Lastly, CAR expressing T cells can be readily prepared in large quantities ex vivo for clinical applications. Indeed, preclinical data targeting HER2 are currently translated into FDA and IRB approved clinical trials for Glioblastoma (NCT01109095; PI: Ahmed), sarcomas (NCT00902044; PI: Ahmed) and lung cancer (NCT00889954; PI: Gottschalk). The studies so far have shown that systemic infusion of HER-specific CAR T cells is safe. Several other studies (Pule et a., 2008; Savoldo et al., 2011) and from others have indicated that infusion of CAR T cells is safe and is associated with clinical benefits (Pule et al., 2008; Morgan et al., 2006; Till et al., 2008; Park et al., 2007; Porter et al., 2011).",
                                "The Tumor Microenvironment: targeting the tumor complex. It is now becoming evident that cancers are heterogenous cellular complexes whose growth is dependent upon reciprocal interactions between the genetically initiated \u201ccancer cells\u201d and the dynamic microenvironment in which they induce (Tisty and Coussens, 2006). These cellular elements include the tumor endothelium, epithelial cells as well as elements from the immune system (Bissell et al., 2005). This crosstalk between the \u201ccancer\u201d cell and cellular elements of its microenvironment is largely mediated by soluble factors. One such factor is, the proangiogenic polypeptide vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (Esposito et al., 2004; Barbera-Guillem et al., 2002). VEGF-A is highly expressed in developing tumors and is secreted by various cellular elements of the tumor microenvironment, including: the tumor endothelial cells, epithelial cells as well as inflammatory and immune infiltrates (Bergers et al., 1998; Bergers et al., 2000). However, the bioavailability of VEGF-A is limited, as it is tethered to secreting cells via membrane-spanning or anchorage domains until cleaved by extracellular proteinases (mostly MMP-2 and MMP-9) (Bergers et al., 1998; Bergers et a., 2000; Egeblad et al., 2010). Uncleaved VEGF-A thus represents a versatile marker for a wide array of cellular elements in the tumor microenvironment that could effectively opsonize these cells for VEGF-A-specific T cells. Very importantly, apart from wound healing areas, the expression of VEGF-A is negligible in normal tissues (Baillie et al., 2001; Hanrahan et al., 2003).",

                                "Bispecific T lymphocytes expressing this tandem CAR molecule (TanCAR) distinctly and specifically recognized and killed tumor cell targets positive for either molecule. Furthermore, an inducible system is used to study the TanCAR functionality in the presence of single and dual target molecules on tumor cells. TanCAR T cells exerted synergistic functionality upon simultaneous engagement of both target molecules on the same cell. Moreover, they maintained their effector function despite downregulation of one target molecule, a characteristic that would maintain cytotoxicity againsT antigen escape tumor variants.",
                                "Embodiments of the present invention show how to systematically design, build and functionally test a TanCAR molecule that will target HER2, a validated tumor \u201ccell\u201d target, and VEGF-A, a molecule that marks various cellular elements of the tumor \u201cmicroenvironment\u201d (as illustrations of the invention only). When grafted on effector T cells, this bispecific cellular product could broadly target the tumor cell and the supporting cellular elements (FIG. 12).",
                                "By virtue of the metabolic activity of cancer cells that is disproportionate to the vascular supply and venous drainage, tumors often have a hypoxic milieu. During hypoxia, tumor cells secrete VEGF-A (Baillie et al., 2001; Hanrahan et al., 2003; Currie et al., 2004). Bispecific TanCAR T cells could thus engage both HER2 and VEGF-A simultaneously (FIG. 13). This was shown in the exemplary TanCAR described herein to synergistically activate T cells.",
                                "While it is currently evident that there is a dire need for novel biologically-based strategies to achieve control of currently incurable malignancies, in specific embodiments of the invention the need is addressed to adopt broad (even multimodality) approaches that undermine the whole tumor \u201ccomplex\u201d. Two versatile cancer antigens: HER2, a well-established target in multiple carcinomas, sarcomas and tumors of the neuraxis, and VEGF-A, an emerging target for multiple common malignancies, may be employed as examples. This makes the domain of applicability of the cellular product quite broad. In embodiments of the invention, one can generate a master cell bank of closely matched (matching at as low as 1-2 antigens) off-the-shelf product by securing 25 lines (for example) covering the most common HLA type, and this will make this therapeutic option available for >85% of patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds.",

Spontaneous folding of amino acid chains into highly organized, biologically functional three-dimensional protein structures, such as a CAR, can be a challenge to the design of novel protein molecules. In particular; protein misfolding, mispairing and malfunction or dysfunction, have traditionally impeded attempts at production of molecules with multiple specificity. Recent advances in computational platforms, through characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process, made the structure prediction, analysis, and design of a novel protein molecule, such as a tandem CAR, more feasible. Furthermore, docking platforms have recently made it possible to predict, with high-accuracy, the docking between candidate molecules in a manner that could correlate well with their functionality.",
                                "(b) Experimental Design. Computational platforms (ModWeb\u00ae, RosettaDock\u00ae and Firedock\u00ae) are used to study the most favorable models for docking of both scFv's, the order of these scFv's and the length of the linker molecule separating them as well as other permutations that will yield the lowest energy for docking and predict the highest avidity of the TanCAR molecule to both targets simultaneously.",
                                "(i) One can consider the most favorable provisional global TanCAR structure, such as whether or not it is proximal to distal arrangement of scFv's. One can consider the most favorable linker length. Models for the bispecific HER2/VEGF-A TanCAR are constructed using ModWeb\u00ae, an automated web server for protein structure modeling. The full length TanCAR sequence is submitted to the ModWeb server, which will identify the two antibody-like fragment domains. From these templates, a homology model is constructed spanning residues of high potential for binding, but also including various lengths of the 10-20 amino acid long GLY-SER linker separating the two variable antigen recognition domains. The structure for the HER2 target is available (PDB ID: 1N8Z), while a homologous structure for VEGF-A has been identified using the BioInfoBank\u00ae metaserver (DB00112). A model for pertinent residues of VEGF-A is constructed with Modeller\u00ae V9.1 using 3MJG (12.59% sequence identity) as a structural template. Initially, pairwise docking is performed with PatchDock\u00ae using the individual TanCAR domains and the corresponding receptor; residues 39-155 (known from prototype TanCAR work) corresponded to the HER2 binding portion of TanCAR, while residues for VEGF-A binding portion of the TanCAR can be researched.",
                                "(ii) One can consider the most favorable model of docking of HER2 and VEGF-A to their respective scFv's. Fits are evaluated visually and based on their PatchDock\u00ae score. For the CAR-HER2 docking, results are additionally filtered based on previous studies that had suggested binding residues and the prototype TanCAR work. Further refinement of the individual candidate dockings are done using FireDock\u00ae. Candidate dockings from both TanCAR-HER2 and TanCAR-VEGF-A are then combined in UCSF Chimera\u00ae and evaluated for steric clashes.",
                                "(iii) One can consider which assembled TanCAR molecule designs yield the most favorable energy docking to both targets simultaneously. The final model for the HER2-TanCAR-VEGF-A docking is selected based on lowest global energy in each of the pairwise dockings from FireDock\u00ae an steric constraints in the entire assembly, in specific embodiments. One can identify up to 10 molecular designs (for example) with favorable profiles.",
                                "One can anticipate being able to identify 5-10 most favorable structures of the HER2/VEGF-A TanCAR for functional testing, because: a) the FRP5 docking to its HER2 binding domain is already solved; b) similarly, one can construct the 2nd svFv and determine the lowest energy docking to VEGF-A. Because of the respective lengths, FRP5 in the juxta-membrane position may be more relaxed and allow for simultaneous binding because the FRP5 molecules binds to the distal-most 4 loupes of HER2. Lastly, the linker may be 10-20 amino acid residues as established by others. If one cannot identify the favorable docking sites, one can use sites with the least energy. If VEGF-A/HER2 is similar to HER2/VEGF-A, one can test both functionally and use the better construct.",

                                "(ii) Retrovirus production and transduction of T cells. To produce retroviral supernatant, 293T cells are cotransfected with retroviral vector containing plasmid for each candidate TanCAR, Peg-Pam-e plasmid encoding the sequence for MoMLV gag-pol, and plasmid pMEVSVg containing the sequence for VSV-G, using GeneJuice\u00ae 39; 40. Transient supernatants containing the retrovirus are collected 48 and 72 hours later. OKT3 activated T cells are transduced with retroviral vectors as described (Straathof et al., 2005; Dotti et al., 2005). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated by Lymphoprep gradient centrifugation. 5\u00d7105 PBMC per well of a 24-well plate were activated with OKT3 at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. On day 2, IL-2 is added at a final concentration of 50 units/mL, and on day 3 cells are harvested for retroviral transduction. One can precoat non-tissue culture treated 24-well plates with fibronectin. Subsequently, 2.5\u00d7105 T cells per well are transduced with retrovirus in IL-2. After 48-72 hours cells are removed and expanded in IL-2 per mL for 10-15 days after TanCAR surface expression by flowcytometry is verified using a) a FAB specific antibody and b) an FRP5 (HER2 scFv) recognizing strategy using HER2.Fc followed by anti-Fc Ab.",
                                "(iii) Do TanCAR-expressing T cells distinctly recognize HER2 and VEGF-A, individually? We will use the previously described retroviral transduction system to force-express the candidate TanCAR molecules on a number of normal donor T cell blasts (n=3 at least) to produce HER2/VEGF-A Tan CAR T cell lines. IFN\u03b3 release and cytotoxicity assays are used to test the specific recognition and lysis of individual target molecules against cells that individually express HER2 or VEGF-A.",
                                "(iv) Does the simultaneous recognition of VEGF-A (in addition to HER2) on hypoxic tumor cells result in improved antitumor activity of TanCAR T cells? While tumor cells do not secrete VEGF-A under normoxic conditions, VEGF-A secretion is induced by hypoxia in an attempt to induce vasculogenesis and reverse the hypoxia and interstitial acidity, both of which are detrimental to tumor growth. Similar to cells from the tumor microenvironment, secreted VEGF-A remains tethered to the tumor cell membrane until enzymatically cleaved, and is amenable to surface detection. This scenario is favorable for TanCAR T cell activation since co-expression of a second CAR target (as shown by initial studies) results in enhanced T cell activation and target cell killing. One can preincubate tumor cells in hypoxia chambers, verify the induction of VEGF-A on the tumor cell surface and perform a set of co-culture experiments, cytokine analysis and cytotoxicity assays to test for this possibility.",
                                "(v) Which is the most favorable TanCAR molecule design that confers the best functionality on recipient primary T cells? In a separate set of studies, the candidate TanCAR cell lines are tested, in parallel, for their differential effector functionality against U373 and U87 and HBMEC cells as well as on hypoxic tumor cells. Collective data is compiled and tested statistically to determine which TanCAR confers the most favorable profile on T cell activation and functionality in vitro against both individual target molecules and simultaneously against both. From the most favorably functioning TanCAR T cell line, one can produce a master cell bank for further in vivo testing and testing in the animal model from at least three healthy donors.",
                                "Based on studies using the prototype HER2/CD19 TanCAR, one can anticipate that the most TanCAR designs are secreted on the cell surface and distinctly recognize both HER2 and VEGF-A. In the event that there is no TanCAR expression, one can change the leader (secretion) sequence on the construct, for example. In the event that the TanCAR T cells fail to recognize either or both targets, one can synthesize and screen the next set of models and/or change the epitope on HER2 or VEGF-A, for example. One can anticipate that the killing of hypoxic GBM cells is enhanced because of the expression of VEGF-A. In the event that this does not occur, one can introduce a hypoxia-inducible element to enhance TanCAR expression in hypoxic conditions.",
                                "(2) Exemplary Rationale.",
                                "Because the simulation of the steric orientation of the tumor cell to tumor stroma is quite limited in in vitro systems, one can use an animal model to test the functionality of HER2/VEGF-A Tan CAR T cells. The expression has been validated, and preclinical targeting of HER2 in models of GBM and a HER2-targeting adoptive immunotherapy trial is currently ongoing at the CAGT (HERT-GBM; NCT01109095; PI: Ahmed). Similarly, multiple groups have extensively characterized VEGF-A expression both in GBM models and in primary human tumors. Indeed, bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae has become the main salvage line for adult GBM). For these reasons, one can test the in vivo efficacy of HER2/VEGF-A TanCAR T cells in an orthotopic murine model of GBM, a model which combines both targets. One can address considerations pertaining to the advantage of the TanCAR approach over targeting either HER2 or VEGF-A, over combining these products or over bispecific T cell co-expressing both HER2 and VEGF-A CARs.",

VEGF-A is largely conserved in human and mouse and contribution from the tumor bed serves as a target, in specific embodiments. Furthermore, established tumor xenografts can have a hypoxic center serving as an adequate model for target coexperession. Recipient NOD-SCID mice are anesthetized, head shaved, then immobilized in a Cunningham\u2122 stereotactic apparatus. The tip of a 31G \u00bd inch needle is introduced to coordinates corresponding to the right frontal cortex. Firefly-luciferase expressing primary GBM cells and U373 GBM cell line is injected. All animals get progressively growing xenografts as evidenced by bioluminescence imaging. Mice are then randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups. After tumor establishment, effector T cells are injected into the same stereo-coordinates. The mice are bioluminescence imaged thrice weekly to monitor tumor progression. Pathological examination are performed on tumor explants. For in vivo testing, one can utilize imageable eGFP. Firefly luciferase expressing U373 cells, for example.",

Tumors are established in animals as outlined above and animals are randomized to receive HER2.VEGF-A TanCAR T cells, HER2 CAR T cells or VEGF-A CAR T cells. Tumor volumes are assessed using bioluminescence and survival analysis is performed at day 90. Control groups receive PBS or non-transduced T cells from the same donor. Statistical analysis is performed as is a Kaplan-Meier plot to assess survival differences. All tumor explants are assessed pathologically for tumor antigen expression and survival of T cells.",
                                "(iii) Is co-targeting HER2 and VEGF-A using HER2.VEGF-A TanCAR T cells better than a pooled product HER2 CAR or VEGF-A CAR T cells, or Bi-specific T cell products? One can test how a pooled product of two cell lines (HER2 CAR T cells plus VEGF-A CAR T cells) or a product of T cells co-expressing both HER2 CAR and VEGF-A CAR compares to HER2/VEGF-A TanCAR T cells in the ability to induce tumor regression and confer a survival advantage on treated animals.",
                                "By virtue of identifying two target molecules simultaneously, TanCAR T cells achieve better tumor control and confer a better survival advantage over targeting single molecules. Further, by docking to two targets simultaneously, enhanced T cell activation gives them an advantage over a pooled product targeting both antigens individually. This is quite advantageous in such a scenario where antigen expression is modest, as in HER2 on GBM cells. Lastly, while co-grafting multiple CAR molecules on T cells results in enhanced activation; yet by its ability to collapse the tumor complex, TanCAR T cells will achieve better tumor control. The inventors have constructed other clinically relevant TanCAR molecules to combine multiple tumor targets (IL13R\u03b32 or EphA2) that may be utilized, in certain embodiments."

Targeting multiple antigens on tumor cells, simultaneously, is useful to offset this escape mechanism and pssibly allow for simultaneous targeting of the tumor and elements of its microenvironment.",

While CD19 and HER2 are not naturally coexpressed on normal or malignant mammalian cells, using them allowed the inventors to distinctly test the bispecific functionality of this CAR and its ability to activate T cells by binding to either or both target molecules. This exodomain was tethered to a hinge and transmembrane and signaling endodomain of the costimulatory molecule, CD28, and the \u03b6 chain of T cell receptor. This bi-specific molecule was expressed on CD3/CD28 activated T cells by retroviral transduction. The functionality of C-CAR expressing bispecific T cells was tested in cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays.",

The sequence of the C-CAR exodomain was confirmed using restriction enzyme digestion and single nucleotide sequencing. T cells expressed both the CD19 as well as the HER2 scFv as judged by FACS analysis. In cytotoxicity assays, C-CAR transduced T cells recognized and killed both CD19 as well as HER2 positive tumor cell targets. Soluble HER2 protein blocked tumor cell lysis in a HER2 protein-dependent manner. Similarly, CD19-blocking antibodies inhibited the CD19 killing in an antibody concentration dependent manner. C-CAR grafted T cells secreted both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in coculture with CD19 and HER2 positive tumor cells. CD19 negative, HER2 negative target cells were not lysed and induced no cytokine release.",

The inventors developed an exemplary molecule, the TanCAR, to simultaneously target the B-cell antigen CD19 and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu; also known as ErbB-2, CD340 and p185). The inventors considered that while CD19 and HER2 are not naturally co-expressed on normal or malignant cells, using them as targets would allow them to directly test the effects of binding one or both target antigens, and the consequences of such binding on T-cell activation and target cell killing. Furthermore, a crystal structure of HER2 was available. While the structure of CD19 is unknown, several potential structural templates, with relatively high sequence similarity, are available for constructing a homolog model of CD19. Coupled with a model on TanCAR, it is possible to reliably assess the docking potential of the these target molecules.",

Gly-Ser tandem repeats represent a highly flexible non-cleavable structure that would allow for near-free motion of the TanCAR subunits. The intracytoplasmic domain of the exemplary TanCAR molecule consists of a CD28 signaling moiety followed by the T-cell receptor (CD3 complex) \u03b6-chain, as previously described (FIG. 1) (Ahmed et al., 2010; Rainusso et al., 2011; Nakazawa et al., 2011; Ahmed et al., 2009)."

                                "To characterize this exemplary molecular arrangement, the inventors generated a structural model of the TanCAR using the protein structure modeling webserver, ModWeb (Pieper et al., 2011; Eswar et al., 2003). Because of the respective lengths of HER2 (632 amino acids; 125 \u212b) and CD19 (280 amino acids; 65 \u212b) extracellular domains and the knowledge that FRP5 binds to the distal-most 4 loops of HER2 (W. Wels; unpublished data), the inventors placed HER2.scFv (FRP5) in the juxta-membrane position and the CD19.scFv in the distal position to allow for more relaxed and potentially simultaneous binding. Four structural templates with greater than 58% sequence identity were identified using ModWeb, from which a model for residues 39-285 of TanCAR was constructed. This model contained the two single chain antibody variable fragments (scFv) tethered to a hinge, transmembrane and signaling domains separated by a Gly-Ser linker (FIG. 2A).",
                                "Using the TanCAR model, the next step was to assess how it might interact with CD19 and HER2. While the structure of HER2 was known (Cho et al., 2003), no structure of CD19 is currently available. As such, a homology model for CD19 was generated using the 3MJG crystal structure as a structural template for residues 1-272 within the Modeller software (Shim et al., 2010).",
                                "Using a combination of Patchdock and FireDock (Andrusier et al., 2007; Schneidman-Duhovny, et al., 2005), automated tools for docking and refining two structures based on shape complimentarity, the TanCAR model was docked pairwise to the HER2 and CD19 structures (FIG. 2B, 2C). Results from the pairwise dockings were screened based on the overall score and agreement with known interaction sites from peptide spotting experiments in the case of HER2 (FIG. 7) (Gerstmayer et al., 1997).",
                                "The pairwise dockings were then visualized and aligned in UCSF's Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004); the ensemble dockings were evaluated for global energy, agreement with interaction sites and steric clashes. This composite docking algorithm yielded only one docking combination that was sterically possible in which the HER2 and CD19 structures were bound to the TanCAR structure without any clashes (FIG. 2D-F).",
                                "Based on this docking, both the HER2 and CD19 protein structures are arranged such that their N-termini are essentially orientated in the same direction. Because the CD19 structure is approximately 50 percent of the size of HER2, there is a separation of \u02dc93 \u212b between the N-termini of both molecules. Differences in orientation of CD19 and HER2 along the cell membrane, as well as variations in the cell membrane itself, could account for the difference between the size and orientation of the receptors.",
                                "While the interface between TanCAR and HER2 is predominated by hydrophobic residues along beta sheets in both molecules, three potential salt bridges exist between Ser48:Arg135, Ser66:Arg56 and Arg12:Asp89 in TanCAR and HER2, respectively. Similarly, the interface between TanCAR and CD19 is primarily characterized by hydrophobic residues in beta sheets of both structures, though more loops from CD19 appear to be involved. Again, three potential salt bridges stabilizing the scFv\u2014target antigen interaction are possible between Glu221:Arg120, Arg232:Asp109 and Asp238:Arg244 in TanCAR and CD19, respectively. From the in silico docking of these molecules, it would appear that the potential interactions of TanCAR with the target molecules could accommodate the intended bi-specificity, and as such, the inventors used this arrangement as an initial model to explore the ability of TanCAR to interact with the target molecules."

The in silico design of the TanCAR extracellular domain was synthesized as a DNA fragment by custom synthesis and then subcloned in frame into an SFG retroviral vector containing a short hinge, the transmembrane and signaling domain of the co-stimulatory molecule, CD28, and the signaling domain of the T-cell receptor (CD3 complex) \u03b6-chain (FIG. 3A) (Moritz et al., 1994; Rossig et al., 2001; Pule et al., 2005). The resulting TanCAR transgene was then expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells as previously described (Ahmed et al., 2007). By flow cytometric analysis, the inventors determined approximately 89% and 59% of 293T cells as TanCAR positive using anti-Fab antibody and a HER2-Fc protein for detection of CD19.scFv and HER2.scFv, respectively (the labeling strategy is outlined in FIG. 8; results are shown in FIG. 3B). After retroviral transduction of CD3/CD28-activated T cells using the transient retroviral supernatant obtained from the TanCAR-expressing 293T cells the TanCAR molecule was detectable on the surface of >70% of the lymphocytes as indicated by flow cytometric analysis (FIG. 3C). Specific detection of the FRP5 HER2.scFv fragment (juxtamembrane binding domain) confirmed that the TanCAR extracellular domain was expressed in its entirety on the surface of the packaging cells as well as the T cells."

In the presence of Doxycycline (D+), 60-85% of the endogenously HER2 positive Daoy.TET.CD19 cells expressed CD19 and the reporter gene mCherry (FIG. 9). In cytotoxicity assays, there was consistently higher killing after the induction of CD19 at all tumor to T cell ratios tested. The relative difference in lysis in the presence or absence of CD19 followed an exponential trend with a higher order equation, an effect that became more evident at higher tumor to T cell ratios (FIG. 5A), indicating a synergistic contribution of bispecific target cell recognition to effector function. Consistent with these results, there was a four-fold increase (p<0.01) in IFN\u03b3 levels in coculture supernatants of TanCAR T cells and Daoy.TET.CD19 cells upon induction of CD19 by the addition of doxycycline (D+) (FIG. 5B).",

The inventors simulated tumor cell downregulation of a targeted antigen by blocking HER2 in CD19-induced (D+) Daoy.TET.CD19 cells using a soluble HER2 fragment. While the competitor successfully impaired HER2-mediated killing in these cells (up to 90%), bi-specific TanCAR T cells were less affected by soluble HER2 fragment blocking because of maintained recognition of CD19 (FIG. 5C)."

Daoy.TET.CD19 xenografts were inoculated in the flanks of SCID mice. The tumors were allowed to establish for approximately 3 weeks, after which animals with established tumors (mean tumor volume 94 \u03bcL; SD 28 \u03bcL) were randomly assigned into four groups. All four groups of animals had similar tumor volumes after randomization. Two groups received doxycycline by intraperitoneal injection to induce the expression of CD19 (DOX+) while the other two received an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; DOX\u2212). Within D+ and DOX\u2212 groups, 5 animals each received intratumoral injections of 10,000 TanCAR T cells/\u03bcL tumor volume. Administration of PBS or doxycycline alone induced minimal or no alteration of the tumor growth pattern. By contrast, treatment with TanCAR T cells resulted in a significant delay in tumor progression that was further increased by induction of CD19 expression in the DOX+ group (FIG. 6A). Kaplan-Meier survival studies 60 days after the PBS or T cells injection showed PBS injected mice with or without doxycycline had a median survival of 28 and 31 days respectively. In contrast, mice treated with TanCAR T cells had a median survival of 44 days (p<0.01). Further, mice treated with TanCAR T cells and receiving doxycycline had a median survival of >60 days with 50% of the mice surviving >80 days (p<0.001; FIG. 6B).

They demonstrated the feasibility of this generally applicable strategy for a complex bispecific TanCAR molecule by cumulative integration of structure and docking simulation data. The prototype TanCAR induced T cell reactivity against each of two target molecules, and produced synergistic enhancement of effector functions when both antigens were simultaneously encountered. Furthermore, the TanCAR preserved the cytolytic effector functions of T cells upon loss of one of the target molecules, and better controlled established experimental tumors by recognition of both targets in an animal disease model.",
                                "An approach using effector cells with multiple specificities could have a number of benefits as cancer therapy. First, the simultaneous targeting of multiple tumor antigens could overcome antigen escape by providing an alternative killing pathway if there is antigen down-regulation or deletion. Secondly, such effector cells would exhibit a broader spectrum of specificities allowing for targeting of heterogeneous antigens, such as those present on the tumor cells and within the tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing tumor control by damaging the tumor complex. Lastly, the encounter of several antigens simultaneously should enhance T cell activation through an increased avidity, a particular benefit when tumors express only modest levels of each target antigen alone (Weijtens et al., 2000; Ahmed et al., 2009). The potential benefits of bispecific antibodies and related molecules have led to an intensive investigation of different designs and specificities of such reagents (Hagemeyer et al., 2009). Unfortunately, their therapeutic use has been hampered by manufacturing feasibility and poor pharmacokinetics and stability (Hagemeyer et al., 2009). Tandem scFv, diabodies, tandem diabodies, two-in-one antibodies, and dual variable domain antibodies (DVD-Ig) are all designs that overcome some of the above limitations but still suffer from the general shortcomings of antibody-based approaches (Hagemeyer et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007; Gu and Ghayur, 2012; Doppalapudi et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2011). Antibodies\u2014unlike T cells\u2014do not actively migrate through microvascular walls or penetrate the core of solid tumors to exert their antitumor activity and usually have no access to the neuraxis, a common sanctuary for cancer cells. Furthermore, in the context of modest expression of target antigens, antibodies are inefficacious. T cells expressing antibody-derived CARs have been shown to overcome all of these limitations (Weijtens et al., 2000; Ahmed et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2009; Verneris et al., 2005).",
                                "The group previously redirected the specificity of T cells to two distinct entities by grafting a tumor-restricted antigen-specific CAR onto T cells whose native receptor was specific for latent-virus antigens. Thus Epstein Barr Virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (EBV-CTLs) were grafted with a CAR specific for the disialo-ganglioside GD2 to treat Neuroblastoma, while Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CTLs were grafted with a HER2-specific CAR to treat Glioblastoma (Pule et al., 2008; Study of Administration of CMV-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Expressing CAR Targeting HER2 I Patients with GBM, 2011). The intent was to enable CAR expressing CTLs to receive optimal costimulation after native-receptor engagement of viral antigens on professional antigen presenting cells, and thereby enhance their in vivo survival in these first-in-man studies (Pule et al., 2008; Study of Administration of CMV-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Expressing CAR Targeting HER2 I Patients with GBM, 2011). The inventors have now provided bispecificity with a single receptor which should further enhance function and resistance to antigen loss. A combination of these approaches is feasible by grafting a TanCAR to a latent virus specific CTL, thereby providing a trispecific T cell. Such a cell would exhibit dual antitumor activity through its CAR component, and also receive appropriate co-stimulation following native T-cell receptor (\u03b1\u03b2TCR) engagement by viral antigens presented by APCs. The TanCAR could be further modified to incorporate additional co-stimulatory endodomains to enhance the degree of T cell activation and persistence that follows antigen engagement (Savoldo et al., 2011; Porter et al., 2011).",
                                "Though much progress has been made, designing novel protein molecules with correct protein folds is still very challenging (Buchner et a., 2011; Kuhlman and Baker, 2004). However, advances in computational modeling and protein-protein docking have made structure design and analysis of a novel protein, such as the aforementioned tandem CAR, more feasible (Park et al., 2004; Perez-Aguilar and Saven, 2012; Samish et al., 2011). By combining biochemical data and employing computational tools, the inventors were able to generate a structural model for TanCAR, as well as model its interface with two target antigens. This TanCAR was then expressed in T cells and analyzed for its biological activity.",
                                "The invention describes the first artificial molecule to render T cells bi-specific. The inventors used modern computational modeling and docking tools, in a staged methodology, to profile the energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process, making the design of a bi-specific CAR more feasible. The TanCAR model was produced from several closely related structures (>50% sequence identity between the sequences of interest and the template structures), demonstrating that computational modeling is a useful tool in the construction of such complex molecules. However, the Gly-Ser linker has no structural template; therefore, the exact structure of this loop and the orientations of the two TanCAR domains with respect to each other most likely exhibit some degree of variation. It is conceivable that, while unbound, TanCAR remains as a soluble, compact, globular protein. However, when bound to HER2 and CD19, steric forces may cause the two domains to separate, remaining tethered to each other through an extended conformation of the Gly-Ser linker. In an extended conformation, this loop could help resolve some of the differences in \u201cheight\u201d of the two target molecules on the surface of the cell. Regardless of the conformation of the loop, the interface proposed by the docking is compatible with either a compact or extended form of the linker.",
                                "Indeed, when the hypothetical molecule was physically generated and tested, the results corroborated the predictive modeling. The surface expression of the optimized TanCAR exodomain in its entirety was validated by flow cytometry with a detection strategy that was specific to the juxta-membrane portion of the molecule (using HER2-Fc as a HER2.scFv (FRP5)-specific moiety). The proper folding and retention of the VL and VH stereo-orientation for HER2 scFv (FRP5) and CD19 scFv was evident in the specific recognition and distinct lysis by TanCAR T cells of tumor cells expressing these target molecules and the blockade of this lysis with the respective competitors. Failure to block the cytolytic effect against cells expressing both targets using soluble HER2 indicated that the dual functionality of TanCAR T cells allowed for persistence of their effector functions despite antigen loss. This redundancy in function would be favorable in such a scenario. Lastly, the exponential enhancement of cytolysis upon induction of CD19 in HER2 expressing target cells indicated synergistic dynamics that further translated into improved tumor control in an animal model of an established tumor using a relatively small dose of T cells. These findings indicate the utility of TanCAR T cells for therapeutic application in human disease.",
                                "With the enhanced activation of TanCAR T cells comes the risk of adverse events related to recognition of modestly expressed antigens resulting in off-target effects. While it has been recently shown that it is possible to quickly eliminate adoptively transferred T cells in case of adverse events by inducing apoptosis through a suicide gene (Di et al., 2011)\u2014TanCAR molecules may be used to \u201cbar code\u201d target cells\u2014wherein only dual antigen expressers are recognized and killed. Alternatively, TanCAR molecules themselves are engineered to include antibody recognizable moieties that\u2014in the advent of adverse events\u2014would allow for the rapid elimination of TanCAR T cells, in specific embodiments of the invention.",

The full length TanCAR sequence was submitted to the ModWeb server, which identified the two antibody-like fragment domains. 1OP3 (Calarese et al., 2003) was identified as a candidate structural template for residues 40-146 (59.81% sequence identity) and 1F3R (Kleinjung et al., 2000) as a candidate structural template for residues 167-329 (58.90% sequence identity). Additional structural templates, 3ESV (64.76% sequence identity) and 2KH2 (59.51% sequence identity) (Leysath et al., 2009; Wilkinso et al., 2009), were also identified covering residues 38-285. From these templates, a homology model was constructed spanning residues 39-329, including the 20 amino acid long Gly-Ser linker. The model was truncated at residue 285 as residues 286-329 were poorly modeled. The structure for HER2 was available (PDB ID: 1N8Z) (Cho et al., 2003). As a note, the 1N8Z structure contains residues 23-629, resulting in a difference in numbering between it and the HER2 precursor protein sequence (uniprot P04626) (Yamamoto et al., 1986). A homologous structure for CD19 was identified using the BioInfoBank metaserver (Ginalski et al., 2003). A model for residues 1-272 CD19 was constructed with Modeller V9.1 (Eswar et al., 2003) using 3MJG (12.59% sequence identity) as a structural template (Shim et al., 2010).",
                                "Initially, pairwise docking was performed with PatchDock (Schnediman-Duhovny et al., 2005) using the individual TanCAR domains and the corresponding receptor; residues 39-155 corresponded to the HER2 binding portion of TanCAR, while residues 156-285 were assigned to the CD19 binding portion of TanCAR. Fits were evaluated visually and based on their PatchDock score. For the TanCAR-HER2 docking, results were additionally filtered based on peptide spotting experiments that had suggested binding residues (FIG. 7). Further refinement of the individual candidate dockings was done using FireDock (Andrusier et al., 2007). Candidate dockings from both CAR-HER2 and CAR-CD19 were then combined in UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and evaluated for steric clashes. The final model for the CD19-CAR-HER2 docking was selected based on lowest global energy in each of the pairwsie dockings from FireDock and steric constraints in the entire assembly.",

                                "The scFv domain targeting the CD19 antigen was provided by Heddy Zola (Child Health Research Institute, Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia) (Zola et al., 1991). The scFv domain targeting HER2 (FRP5) was previously described by Wels and colleagues (Wels et al., 1992). The modeled bi-specific extracellular domain (excluding the Gly-Ser tandem repeat hinge), composed of the CD19 and HER2 scFv antibody fragments in tandem and separated by a linker, was assembled on Clone Manager\u00ae (Sci-Ed Software Inc, Cary, N.C.). The designed transgene DNA sequence was modified to include restriction enzyme sites at the cloning sites and exclude any inadvertently inserted sites within the translation elements, then optimized using the GeneOptimizer\u00ae software for maximum protein production (Raab et al., 2010). The TanCAR extracellular domain was then synthesized by GeneArt\u00ae Inc. using oligonucleotides, cloned into the Gateway\u00ae entry vector pDONR\u2122221, standard cloning vector, and sequence-verified. This antigen recognition domain was then subcloned in frame into an SFG retroviral vector containing a short hinge, and the transmembrane and signaling domain of the costimulatory molecule, CD28 and the signaling domain of the T-cell receptor \u03b6-chain (FIG. 3A) (Moritz et al., 1994; Rossig et al., 2001; Pule et al., 2005). The structure of the construct was confirmed using restriction digests. The 5\u2032- and 3\u2032 as well as the 3\u2032-5\u2032 sequence of the whole construct was confirmed using single base pair pyro-sequencing (SeqWright DNA Technology Services, Houston, Tex.) with a homology of >97% with the optimized construct map.",

Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Lymphoprep (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, N.C.) gradient centrifugation. 5\u00d7105 PBMC per well in a 24-well plate were activated with OKT3 (OrthoBiotech, Raritan, N J) and CD28 monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif.) at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. On day 2, recombinant human IL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, Calif.) was added at a final concentration of 100 U/mL, and two days later, cells were harvested for retroviral transduction. For transduction, we pre-coated a non-tissue culture treated 24-well plate with a recombinant fibronectin fragment (FN CH-296; Retronectin; Takara Bio USA, Madison, Wis.). Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and incubated twice for 30 minutes with vector particles. Subsequently, 3\u00d7105 T cells per well were transduced with retrovirus in the presence of 100 U/mL IL-2. After 48-72 hours cells were removed and expanded in the presence of 50-100 U/mL IL-2 for 10-15 days prior to use.",

Target cells incubated in complete medium alone or in 1% Triton X-100 were used to determine spontaneous and maximum 51Cr release, respectively. After 4 hours we collected supernatants and measured radioactivity in a gamma counter (Cobra Quantum; PerkinElmer; Wellesley; MA). The mean percentage of specific lysis of triplicate wells was calculated according to the following formula: [test release\u2212spontaneous release]/[maximal release\u2212spontaneous release]\u00d7100.",

The CD19 encoding DNA fragment was subcloned downstream of the inducible promoter PTRE3G using PCR amplification. Daoy cells expressed CD19, but only when cultured in the presence of doxycycline (Dox), a tetracycline analog. When bound by Dox, the Tet-On\u00ae 3G protein undergoes a conformational change that allows it to bind to tet operator (tetO) sequences located in the inducible promoter PTRE3G.

Eight to ten week old male mice were anesthetized with rapid sequence inhalation of isofluorane (Abbot Laboratories) followed by subcutaneous injection of 1\u00d7106 DAOY.TET.CD19 cells (in 100 \u03bcl PBS) per flank per mouse (Day 0). Tumors were then allowed approximately three weeks to fully engraft. Mice with established tumors (mean tumor volume 940: SD 28 \u03bcL) were randomly assigned to four groups (n=5 tumors/group). Tumor volume was calculated from the product of the bi-dimensional area measured with an electronic caliper. All four groups of animals had similar tumor volumes after randomization. To induce the expression of CD19 (D+) two groups received daily for one week, 2400 \u03bcg/kg of doxycycline via intraperitoneal injection (individual dose of 80 \u03bcg/mouse) followed by one daily dose three times a week. The other half received an equal volume of PBS (D\u2212) on the same dosing schedule. On the third day of doxycycline/PBS administration, within the D+ and D\u2212 groups, 5 animals each received intratumoral injections of 10,000 TanCAR T cells per \u03bcL tumor volume.

        "2. The cell of claim 1, wherein the two or more antigens are configured in the CAR in a tandem arrangement.",
        "3. The cell of claim 1, wherein there is a linker region between the two non-identical antigen recognition domains.",
        "4. The cell of claim 3, wherein the linker region is between 5 and 30 amino acids.",
        "5. The cell of claim 3, wherein the linker region is comprised of glycine, serine, or both.",
        "6. The cell of claim 1, wherein the CAR further comprises a signaling endodomain of a costimulatory molecule selected from the group consisting of CD 28, 41BB, OX40 and zeta chain of the T cell receptor.",
        "7. The cell of claim 1, further defined as a T cell, a NK cell, or a NKT cell.",
        "8. An expression vector encoding a CAR comprising two or more non-identical antigen recognition domains.",
        "9. The vector of claim 8, further defined as a lentiviral vector, a retroviral vector, an adenoviral vector, an adeno-associated viral vector, a plasmid, or RNA.",
        "10. A method of producing the cell of claim 1, comprising the step of transducing a T lymphocyte with an expression vector that encodes a CAR comprising two or more non-identical antigen recognition domains.",
        "11. A method of killing a cancer cell in an individual, comprising the step of providing to the individual a therapeutically effective amount of cells of claim 1.",
