                "HER2 and IL13R\u03b12 are currently targeted in Phase I glioblastoma (GBM) trials using CAR T cells. We created a bispecific CAR molecule with a HER2-specific scFv joined in tandem to an IL13R\u03b12-binding moiety in the CAR exodomain (Tandem CAR) and a CD28.\u03b6 signaling endodomain. We used computational modeling to interrogate this design. GBM patients' Tandem CAR T cells showed distinct binding to soluble HER2 and IL13R\u03b12 and killed primary autologous GBM cells. Three-dimensional reconstitution and quantification of confocal images of the Tandem CAR T cell/tumor interface revealed enhanced bifunctional immunological synapses compared to conventional CARs. Further, Tandem CAR T cells exhibited significantly enhanced inexhaustible activation dynamics when compared to conventional HER2 or IL13R\u03b12 CAR T cells and better controlled established GBM in an orthotopic murine model by offsetting both HER2 and IL13R\u03b12 escape."
