# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of producing lipases. More specifically the invention relates to methods for generating preparation of lipases with increased lipolytic activity by employing modified polynucleotides encoding lipase. The modified polynucleotides encode lipases wherein the modification is comprised in the polynucleotide encoding the propeptide.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Lipases are important industrial enzymes which are widely used in many applications. One of the major obstacles for a still wider utilization is the production cost of lipase and several efforts have been made to increase the yield of lipases by optimization of the production steps.

Expression of lipases in cells is dependent on several regulatory sequences which are not part of the mature protein. One such regulator is a propeptide located when present N-terminally just before the sequence of the mature lipase. A few publications have described modifications in the propeptide of Rhizomucor miehei lipase:


- CN102851263 (Fengyi Shanghai Biotech Res & Dev CT Co LTD) describes
  that the L57V (L-14V) mutant, and L57V (L-14V) mutants further
  comprising V67A (V-4A), S65A (S-6A) as well as mutations in the mature
  lipase showed increased activity.
- CN102337253 (Zhejiang University) describes that mutants comprising
  the mutations D48V (D-23V), and/or V67A,D (V-4A,D) together with
  mutations in the mature lipase demonstrated improved activity and
  thermostability. The effect of mutations in the propeptide alone was
  not disclosed.
- Wang, J., et al. 2012 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol vol 96: p 443-50
  describes that mutants with the mutations: L57V, D64A, S65A and V67A
  in the propeptide showed an increase in activity (Kcat(min−1)) over
  the wildtype.
- Lui, Y., et al. 2014 Curr Microbiol vol 68: p 186-91 describes that
  deglycosylation of the propeptide in N8A (N-63A) and N58A (N-13A)
  mutants exhibited a twofold higher activity as compared to the
  wildtype.

The challenge is to produce increased amounts of enzyme protein in an active form which also will function in the various applications such as in detergent compositions.

There is thus still a need for additional means for improving both the quantity as well as the quality lipase.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Lipases have for many years been employed with success in various applications. However the selection of efficient lipases available for use in cleaning compositions is still quite limited. Attempts have been made to modify lipases to obtain variants with altered characteristics such as activity, stability, etc. to provide lipases with better compatibility with cleaning composition components. So far there is still a challenge in providing lipases which are not only able to survive the harsh environment of the cleaning compositions but at the same time show a wash performance.

The present invention relates to methods for generating preparation of lipases with increased lipolytic activity by employing modified polynucleotides encoding lipase. Surprisingly it was found that modified polynucleotides encode lipases wherein the modification is comprised in the polynucleotide encoding the propeptide lead to preparations with an increased yield of active lipase suitable for use in cleaning compositions.

### Conventions for Designation of Variants

For purposes of the present invention, the polypeptide disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 3 is used to determine the corresponding amino acid residue in another lipase. The amino acid sequence of another lipase is aligned with SEQ ID NO: 3, and based on the alignment, the amino acid position number corresponding to any amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO: 3 is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277), preferably version 5.0.0 or later. The parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix.

Identification of the corresponding amino acid residue in another lipase can be determined by an alignment of multiple polypeptide sequences using several computer programs including, but not limited to, MUSCLE (multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation; version 3.5 or later; Edgar, 2004, Nucleic Acids Research 32: 1792-1797), MAFFT (version 6.857 or later; Katoh and Kuma, 2002, Nucleic Acids Research 30: 3059-3066; Katoh et al., 2005, Nucleic Acids Research 33: 511-518; Katoh and Toh, 2007, Bioinformatics 23: 372-374; Katoh et al., 2009, Methods in Molecular Biology 537: 39-64; Katoh and Toh, 2010, Bioinformatics 26: 1899-1900), and EMBOSS EMMA employing ClustalW (1.83 or later; Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Research 22: 4673-4680), using their respective default parameters.

When the other enzyme has diverged from the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 3 such that traditional sequence-based comparison fails to detect their relationship (Lindahl and Elofsson, 2000, J. Mol. Biol. 295: 613-615), other pairwise sequence comparison algorithms can be used. Greater sensitivity in sequence-based searching can be attained using search programs that utilize probabilistic representations of polypeptide families (profiles) to search databases. For example, the PSI-BLAST program generates profiles through an iterative database search process and is capable of detecting remote homologs (Atschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402). Even greater sensitivity can be achieved if the family or superfamily for the polypeptide has one or more representatives in the protein structure databases. Programs such as GenTHREADER (Jones, 1999, J. Mol. Biol. 287: 797-815; McGuffin and Jones, 2003, Bioinformatics 19: 874-881) utilize information from a variety of sources (PSI-BLAST, secondary structure prediction, structural alignment profiles, and solvation potentials) as input to a neural network that predicts the structural fold for a query sequence. Similarly, the method of Gough et al., 2000, J. Mol. Biol. 313: 903-919, can be used to align a sequence of unknown structure with the superfamily models present in the SCOP database. These alignments can in turn be used to generate homology models for the polypeptide, and such models can be assessed for accuracy using a variety of tools developed for that purpose.

For proteins of known structure, several tools and resources are available for retrieving and generating structural alignments. For example the SCOP superfamilies of proteins have been structurally aligned, and those alignments are accessible and downloadable. Two or more protein structures can be aligned using a variety of algorithms such as the distance alignment matrix (Holm and Sander, 1998, Proteins 33: 88-96) or combinatorial extension (Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998, Protein Engineering 11: 739-747), and implementation of these algorithms can additionally be utilized to query structure databases with a structure of interest in order to discover possible structural homologs (e.g., Holm and Park, 2000, Bioinformatics 16: 566-567).

For the purpose of the present invention other lipases should be aligned with the lipases shown in FIG. 1. The multiple alignments shown in FIG. 1 were generated by using the program Muscle v3.8.31 (http://www.drive5.com/muscle, Edgar, R. C. Nucleic Acids Res 32(5), 1792-97) which should also be used for alignment of other lipases.

In describing the variants of the present invention, the nomenclature described below is adapted for ease of reference. The accepted IUPAC single letter or three letter amino acid abbreviations are employed.

Substitutions.

For an amino acid substitution, the following nomenclature is used: Original amino acid, position, substituted amino acid. Accordingly, the substitution of threonine at position 226 with alanine is designated as “Thr226Ala” or “T226A”. Multiple mutations are separated by addition marks (“+”), e.g., “Gly205Arg+Ser411Phe” or “G205R+S411F”, representing substitutions at positions 205 and 411 of glycine (G) with arginine (R) and serine (S) with phenylalanine (F), respectively.

Deletions.

For an amino acid deletion, the following nomenclature is used: Original amino acid, position, *. Accordingly, the deletion of glycine at position 195 is designated as “Gly195*” or “G195*”. Multiple deletions are separated by addition marks (“+”), e.g., “Gly195*+Ser411*” or “G195*+S411*”.

Insertions.

For an amino acid insertion, the following nomenclature is used: Original amino acid, position, original amino acid, inserted amino acid. Accordingly the insertion of lysine after glycine at position 195 is designated “Gly195GlyLys” or “G195GK”. An insertion of multiple amino acids is designated [Original amino acid, position, original amino acid, inserted amino acid #1, inserted amino acid #2; etc.]. For example, the insertion of lysine and alanine after glycine at position 195 is indicated as “Gly195GlyLysAla” or “G195GKA”. In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue(s). In the above example, the sequence would thus be:

Multiple Alterations.

Variants comprising multiple alterations are separated by addition marks (“+”), e.g., “Arg170Tyr+Gly195Glu” or “R170Y+G195E” representing a substitution of arginine and glycine at positions 170 and 195 with tyrosine and glutamic acid, respectively.

Different Alterations.

Where different alterations can be introduced at a position, the different alterations are separated by a comma, e.g., “Arg170Tyr,Glu” represents a substitution of arginine at position 170 with tyrosine or glutamic acid. Thus, “Tyr167Gly,Ala+Arg170Gly,Ala” designates the following variants:

Changes in the polynucleotides encoding these lipase contact zones of the propeptide are considered to have an impact on the interaction between the propeptide and the mature protein of the lipase. The effect of generating propeptide variants does not change the primary structure of the mature protein of the lipase, but may confer a change in the conformation of the lipase.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide encoding a propeptide with an altered association and/or dissociation with the mature protein of the lipase. As a result there may be a change in the amount of lipase associated with a propeptide and the amount of lipase not associated with a propeptide. It is considered that the high molecular weight band observed in the preparations shown in the Native PAGE example infra represents lipase associated with propeptide whereas the low molecular weight band represents lipase not associated with propeptide. Thus in some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide, wherein the alteration results in a change of the amount of HMW band and/or the amount of the LMW band present in the preparation. In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide, wherein the alteration results in a change of the ratio of the LMW band to the HMW band present in the preparation.

Lipase associated with propeptide variants may have a change in thermostability as measured by e.g. Temperature Stability Assay (TSA), Tm (° C.) and/or different thermal denaturation temperature, Td (° C.) as compared to lipase associated with unchanged propeptide i.e. wildtype propeptide, or lipase not associated with propeptide. In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide, wherein the alteration leads to a change in thermostability of the lipase. The change may be either an increase in thermostability or a decrease in thermostability,

To further augment the effect of altering the propeptide of a lipase according to the present invention as described further changes in the mature protein of the lipase may be introduced. It may even be sufficient to make the alteration in the mature protein of the lipase alone. Structural analysis of RmL has indicated the presence of certain propeptide contact zones in the mature protein of the lipase that interact with the lipase contact zones of the propeptide.

The propeptide contact zones in a lipase may be selected from any position corresponding to positions: 89-94; 101-103; 105; 119-120; 123-124; 127; 156; 158-165; 178; 182-183; 186-187; 190; 201-202; 204: 206-213; 216; 223-225; 239-242; and 246-255 in SEQ ID NO: 3.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide encoding a lipase comprising a first polynucleotide encoding the propeptide of the lipase operationally linked to a second polynucleotide encoding the mature protein of the lipase, wherein the encoded propeptide and the encoding the mature protein of the lipase both comprises an alteration at one or more positions where the alteration independently is a substitution, an insertion or a deletion.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide encoding a lipase comprising a first polynucleotide encoding the propeptide of the lipase operationally linked to a second polynucleotide encoding the mature protein of the lipase, wherein the encoded mature protein of the lipase comprises an alteration at one or more positions where the alteration independently is a substitution, an insertion or a deletion.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a polynucleotide, wherein the alteration enhances the production of the encoded mature region of the lipase.

### Nucleic Acid Constructs

The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising a polynucleotide encoding a variant of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences.

The polynucleotide may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of a variant. Manipulation of the polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.

The control sequence may be a promoter, a polynucleotide which is recognized by a host cell for expression of the polynucleotide. The promoter contains transcriptional control sequences that mediate the expression of the variant. The promoter may be any polynucleotide that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell including mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.

Examples of suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a bacterial host cell are the promoters obtained from the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase gene (amyQ), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene (amyL), Bacillus licheniformis penicillinase gene (penP), Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene (amyM), Bacillus subtilis levansucrase gene (sacB), Bacillus subtilis xylA and xylB genes, Bacillus thuringiensis cryllIA gene (Agaisse and Lereclus, 1994, Molecular Microbiology 13: 97-107), E. coli lac operon, E. coli trc promoter (Egon et al., 1988, Gene 69: 301-315), Streptomyces coelicolor agarase gene (dagA), and prokaryotic beta-lactamase gene (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 3727-3731), as well as the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 21-25). Further promoters are described in “Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria” in Gilbert et al., 1980, Scientific American 242: 74-94; and in Sambrook et al., 1989, supra. Examples of tandem promoters are disclosed in WO 99/43835.

Examples of suitable promoters for directing transcription of the nucleic acid constructs of the present invention in a filamentous fungal host cell are promoters obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans acetamidase, Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger acid stable alpha-amylase, Aspergillus niger or Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase (glaA), Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Aspergillus oryzae alkaline protease, Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase, Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease (WO96/00787), Fusarium venenatum amyloglucosidase (WO00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Dania (WO00/56900), Fusarium venenatum Quinn (WO00/56900), Rhizomucor miehei lipase, Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase, Trichoderma reesei beta-glucosidase, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase I, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase III, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase IV, Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase V, Trichoderma reesei xylanase I, Trichoderma reesei xylanase II, Trichoderma reesei beta-xylosidase, as well as the NA2-tpi promoter (a modified promoter from an Aspergillus neutral alpha-amylase gene in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from an Aspergillus triose phosphate isomerase gene; non-limiting examples include modified promoters from an Aspergillus niger neutral alpha-amylase gene in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from an Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae triose phosphate isomerase gene); and mutant, truncated, and hybrid promoters thereof.

In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae galactokinase (GAL1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH1, ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423-488.

The control sequence may also be a transcription terminator, which is recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked to the 3′-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the variant. Any terminator that is functional in the host cell may be used.

Preferred terminators for bacterial host cells are obtained from the genes for Bacillus clausii alkaline protease (aprH), Bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase (amyL), and Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (rrnB).

Preferred terminators for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease.

Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.

The control sequence may also be an mRNA stabilizer region downstream of a promoter and upstream of the coding sequence of a gene which increases expression of the gene.

Examples of suitable mRNA stabilizer regions are obtained from a Bacillus thuringiensis cryllIA gene (WO94/25612) and a Bacillus subtilis SP82 gene (Hue et al., 1995, Journal of Bacteriology 177: 3465-3471).

The control sequence may also be a leader, a nontranslated region of an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably linked to the 5′-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the variant. Any leader that is functional in the host cell may be used.

Preferred leaders for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase and Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase.

Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP).

The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably linked to the 3′-terminus of the variant-encoding sequence and, when transcribed, is recognized by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell may be used.

Preferred polyadenylation sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are obtained from the genes for Aspergillus nidulans anthranilate synthase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus niger alpha-glucosidase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, and Fusarium oxysporum trypsin-like protease.

Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and Sherman, 1995, Mol. Cellular Biol. 15: 5983-5990.

The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a variant and directs the variant into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5′-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the variant. Alternatively, the 5′-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, a foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the variant. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed variant into the secretory pathway of a host cell may be used.

Effective signal peptide coding sequences for bacterial host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Bacillus NCIB 11837 maltogenic amylase, Bacillus licheniformis subtilisin, Bacillus licheniformis beta-lactamase, Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase, Bacillus stearothermophilus neutral proteases (nprT, nprS, nprM), and Bacillus subtilis prsA. Further signal peptides are described by Simonen and Palva, 1993, Microbiological Reviews 57: 109-137.

Effective signal peptide coding sequences for filamentous fungal host cells are the signal peptide coding sequences obtained from the genes for Aspergillus niger neutral amylase, Aspergillus niger glucoamylase, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase, Humicola insolens cellulase, Humicola insolens endoglucanase V, Humicola lanuginosa lipase, and Rhizomucor miehei aspartic proteinase.

Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase. Other useful signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra.

The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a variant. Where both signal peptide and propeptide sequences are present, the propeptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the variant and the signal peptide sequence is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence.

It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that regulate expression of the variant relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase promoter, Aspergillus oryzae TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and Aspergillus oryzae glucoamylase promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the variant would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.

### Expression Vectors

The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide encoding a variant of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleotide and control sequences may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the polynucleotide encoding the variant at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.

The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid.

The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.

The vector preferably contains one or more selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.

Examples of bacterial selectable markers are Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus subtilis dal genes, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to, ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an Aspergillus cell are Aspergillus nidulans or Aspergillus oryzae amdS and pyrG genes and a Streptomyces hygroscopicus bar gene.

The vector preferably contains an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.

For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the variant or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.

For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term “origin of replication” or “plasmid replicator” means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo.

Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in E. coli, and pUB110, pE194, pTA1060, and pAMß1 permitting replication in Bacillus.

Examples of origins of replication for use in a yeast host cell are the 2 micron origin of replication, ARS1, ARS4, the combination of ARS1 and CEN3, and the combination of ARS4 and CEN6.

Examples of origins of replication useful in a filamentous fungal cell are AMA1 and ANSI (Gems et al., 1991, Gene 98: 61-67; Cullen et al., 1987, Nucleic Acids Res. 15: 9163-9175; WO00/24883). Isolation of the AMA1 gene and construction of plasmids or vectors comprising the gene can be accomplished according to the methods disclosed in WO 00/24883.

More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a variant. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.

The procedures used to ligate the elements described above to construct the recombinant expression vectors of the present invention are well known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).

### Host Cells

The present invention also relates to recombinant host cells, comprising a polynucleotide encoding a variant of the present invention operably linked to one or more control sequences that direct the production of a variant of the present invention. A construct or vector comprising a polynucleotide is introduced into a host cell so that the construct or vector is maintained as a chromosomal integrant or as a self-replicating extra-chromosomal vector as described earlier. The term “host cell” encompasses any progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during replication. The choice of a host cell will to a large extent depend upon the gene encoding the variant and its source.

The host cell may be any cell useful in the recombinant production of a variant, e.g., a prokaryote or a eukaryote.

The prokaryotic host cell may be any Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterium. Gram-positive bacteria include, but are not limited to, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Geobacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Oceanobacillus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptomyces. Gram-negative bacteria include, but are not limited to, Campylobacter, E. coli, Flavobacterium, Fusobacterium, Helicobacter, Ilyobacter, Neisseria, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Ureaplasma.

The bacterial host cell may be any Bacillus cell including, but not limited to, Bacillus alkalophilus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus clausii, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus lautus, Bacillus lentus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis cells.

The bacterial host cell may also be any Streptococcus cell including, but not limited to, Streptococcus equisimilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus uberis, and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus cells.

The bacterial host cell may also be any Streptomyces cell, including, but not limited to, Streptomyces achromogenes, Streptomyces avermitilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Streptomyces griseus, and Streptomyces lividans cells.

The introduction of DNA into a Bacillus cell may be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Chang and Cohen, 1979, Mol. Gen. Genet. 168: 111-115), competent cell transformation (see, e.g., Young and Spizizen, 1961, J. Bacteriol. 81: 823-829, or Dubnau and Davidoff-Abelson, 1971, J. Mol. Biol. 56: 209-221), electroporation (see, e.g., Shigekawa and Dower, 1988, Biotechniques 6: 742-751), or conjugation (see, e.g., Koehler and Thorne, 1987, J. Bacteriol. 169: 5271-5278). The introduction of DNA into an E. coli cell may be effected by protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Hanahan, 1983, J. Mol. Biol. 166: 557-580) or electroporation (see, e.g., Dower et al., 1988, Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 6127-6145). The introduction of DNA into a Streptomyces cell may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation (see, e.g., Gong et al., 2004, Folia Microbiol. (Praha) 49: 399-405), conjugation (see, e.g., Mazodier et al., 1989, J. Bacteriol. 171: 3583-3585), or transduction (see, e.g., Burke et al., 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98: 6289-6294). The introduction of DNA into a Pseudomonas cell may be effected by electroporation (see, e.g., Choi et al., 2006, J. Microbiol. Methods 64: 391-397), or conjugation (see, e.g., Pinedo and Smets, 2005, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 71: 51-57). The introduction of DNA into a Streptococcus cell may be effected by natural competence (see, e.g., Perry and Kuramitsu, 1981, Infect. Immun. 32: 1295-1297), protoplast transformation (see, e.g., Catt and Jollick, 1991, Microbios 68: 189-207), electroporation (see, e.g., Buckley et al., 1999, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65: 3800-3804) or conjugation (see, e.g., Clewell, 1981, Microbiol. Rev. 45: 409-436). However, any method known in the art for introducing DNA into a host cell can be used.

The host cell may also be a eukaryote, such as a mammalian, insect, plant, or fungal cell.

The host cell may be a fungal cell. “Fungi” as used herein includes the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota as well as the Oomycota and all mitosporic fungi (as defined by Hawksworth et al., In, Ainsworth and Bisby's Dictionary of The Fungi, 8th edition, 1995, CAB International, University Press, Cambridge, UK).

The fungal host cell may be a yeast cell. “Yeast” as used herein includes ascosporogenous yeast (Endomycetales), basidiosporogenous yeast, and yeast belonging to the Fungi Imperfecti (Blastomycetes). Since the classification of yeast may change in the future, for the purposes of this invention, yeast shall be defined as described in Biology and Activities of Yeast (Skinner, Passmore, and Davenport, editors, Soc. App. Bacteriol. Symposium Series No. 9, 1980).

The yeast host cell may be a Candida, Hansenula, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Saccharomyces, Schizosaccharomyces, or Yarrowia cell such as a Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces diastaticus, Saccharomyces douglasii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces norbensis, Saccharomyces oviformis, or Yarrowia lipolytica cell.

The fungal host cell may be a filamentous fungal cell. “Filamentous fungi” include all filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycota and Oomycota (as defined by Hawksworth et al., 1995, supra). The filamentous fungi are generally characterized by a mycelial wall composed of chitin, cellulose, glucan, chitosan, mannan, and other complex polysaccharides. Vegetative growth is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligately aerobic. In contrast, vegetative growth by yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by budding of a unicellular thallus and carbon catabolism may be fermentative.

The filamentous fungal host cell may be an Acremonium, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Bjerkandera, Ceriporiopsis, Chrysosporium, Coprinus, Coriolus, Cryptococcus, Filibasidium, Fusarium, Humicola, Magnaporthe, Mucor, Myceliophthora, Neocallimastix, Neurospora, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Piromyces, Pleurotus, Schizophyllum, Talaromyces, Thermoascus, Thielavia, Tolypocladium, Trametes, or Trichoderma cell.

Fungal cells may be transformed by a process involving protoplast formation, transformation of the protoplasts, and regeneration of the cell wall in a manner known per se. Suitable procedures for transformation of Aspergillus and Trichoderma host cells are described in EP238023, Yelton et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 1470-1474, and Christensen et al., 1988, Bio/Technology 6: 1419-1422. Suitable methods for transforming Fusarium species are described by Malardier et al., 1989, Gene 78: 147-156, and WO 96/00787. Yeast may be transformed using the procedures described by Becker and Guarente, In Abelson, J. N. and Simon, M. I., editors, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology, Methods in Enzymology, Volume 194, pp 182-187, Academic Press, Inc., New York; Ito et al., 1983, J. Bacteriol. 153: 163; and Hinnen et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75: 1920.

### Methods of Production

The present invention relates to methods of producing a variant, comprising: (a) cultivating a host cell of the present invention under conditions suitable for expression of the variant; and (b) recovering the variant.

The host cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the variant using methods known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, or small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the variant to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the variant is secreted into the nutrient medium, the variant can be recovered directly from the medium. If the variant is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell lysates.

The variant may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the variants. These detection methods include, but are not limited to, use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the variant may be the assay described in the examples below.

The variant may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the variant may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, collection, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.

The variant may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., Protein Purification, Janson and Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure variants.

In an alternative aspect, the variant is not recovered, but rather a host cell of the present invention expressing the variant is used as a source of the variant.

Production of lipases may be optimized to result in high yields of lipase protein for the purpose of cost-benefit. It is however not always that all lipase protein present is active and/or sufficiently stable in compositions to remain active. For some preparation of lipases the yield of active protein is very low and this limits the use of such lipases on an industrial scale. A method has been developed whereby lipase preparations with increased lipolytic activity may be generated by altering one or more nucleotides in the polynucleotide encoding the propeptide. In the preparation at least two forms of lipase could be identified: An active form and an inactive form. Unfortunately the majority of the lipase was in the inactive form. It would therefore be desirable to shift the balance and identify a method whereby the majority of the lipase would be in an active form. The method of the present invention has shown to result in lipase preparations with increased amount of the active form of the lipase.

The present invention relates to a method for generating a preparation of lipase with increased lipolytic activity comprising a step of altering one or more nucleotides in a polynucleotide comprising a first polynucleotide encoding a propeptide operationally linked to a second polynucleotide encoding a lipase, wherein the alteration of one or more nucleotides are made in the first polynucleotide and the alteration independently results in a substitution, an insertion or a deletion in the encoded propeptide amino acid sequence.

As described supra the propeptide may be divided into various lipase contact zones encoded by the corresponding polynucleotide regions.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein the alteration of one or more nucleotides is selected from any of the nucleotides encoding a propeptide amino acid which is comprised in a lipase contact zone.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein the lipase contact zone is any of the major lipase contact zones selected from the amino acids corresponding to residues −57 to −46, −38 to −26, and −22 to −8 of SEQ ID NO: 2, provided that the alteration is not a substitution corresponding to S-24F of SEQ ID NO: 2.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein the lipase contact zone is any of the secondary lipase contact zones selected from the amino acids corresponding to residues −70 to −58, −49 to −39, −27 to −25, and −14 to −1 of SEQ ID NO: 2.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein the sequence identity of one or more of the major lipase contact zones are at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% with SEQ ID NO: 2.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein said preparation has an increased ratio of LMW lipase to HMW lipase as compared to a preparation generated by an identical method not comprising a step of altering one or more nucleotides.

In some aspects the present invention relates to a method, wherein said preparation comprises lipases with lower Tm (° C.) and/or lower Td (° C.) as compared to a preparation generated by an identical method not comprising a step of altering one or more nucleotides.

The lipase prepared by the method of the invention has shown to be active in detergent compositions and wash performance has been demonstrated in the examples. In some aspects the invention relates to a method for preparing a detergent composition comprising lipase preparation obtained according to the method of the invention as described. In some aspects the invention relates to a method for preparing a detergent composition comprising a lipase prepared by a method for generating a preparation of lipase with increased lipolytic activity comprising a step of altering one or more nucleotides in a polynucleotide comprising a first polynucleotide encoding a propeptide operationally linked to a second polynucleotide encoding a lipase, wherein the alteration of one or more nucleotides are made in the first polynucleotide and the alteration independently results in a substitution, an insertion or a deletion in the encoded propeptide amino acid sequence.

Lipase prepared according to the method may be activated or reactivated upon contact with detergent and/or protease. In some aspects the present invention relates to a method for increasing the activity of the lipase prepared according to the method, comprising the step of bringing said lipase into contact with protease and/or detergent.

In some aspects the invention relates to an isolated propeptide variant encoded by the first polynucleotide as describe supra. In some aspects the invention relates to use of the isolated propeptide variant for modifying a lipase. Reference is made to the co-filed patent applications relating to lipase variants (12937) and methods for modifying a lipase (12961) respectively which are hereby incorporated by reference. In some aspects the invention relates to a method for modifying a lipase comprising a step of contacting the lipase with the isolated propeptide variant. The modified lipase may have an altered property such as e.g. increased activity, decreased activity, increased stability, decreased stability as well as other properties described in the paragraph “Improved properties” supra. The lipase may be a lipase variant as disclosed in the patent application 12937.

**Detergents**

Soap—

The compositions herein may contain soap. Without being limited by theory, it may be desirable to include soap as it acts in part as a surfactant and in part as a builder and may be useful for suppression of foam and may furthermore interact favorably with the various cationic compounds of the composition to enhance softness on textile fabrics treaded with the inventive compositions. Any soap known in the art for use in laundry detergents may be utilized. In one embodiment, the compositions contain from 0 wt % to 20 wt %, from 0.5 wt % to 20 wt %, from 4 wt % to 10 wt %, or from 4 wt % to 7 wt % of soap.

Examples of soap useful herein include oleic acid soaps, palmitic acid soaps, palm kernel fatty acid soaps, and mixtures thereof. Typical soaps are in the form of mixtures of fatty acid soaps having different chain lengths and degrees of substitution. One such mixture is topped palm kernel fatty acid.

In one embodiment, the soap is selected from free fatty acid.

Levels of soap and of nonsoap anionic surfactants herein are percentages by weight of the detergent composition, specified on an acid form basis. However, as is commonly understood in the art, anionic surfactants and soaps are in practice neutralized using sodium, potassium or alkanolammonium bases, such as sodium hydroxide or monoethanolamine.

Hydrotropes—

The compositions of the present invention may comprise one or more hydrotropes. A hydrotrope is a compound that solubilises hydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions (or oppositely, polar substances in a non-polar environment). Typically, hydrotropes have both hydrophilic and a hydrophobic character (so-called amphiphilic properties as known from surfactants); however the molecular structure of hydrotropes generally do not favor spontaneous self-aggregation, see e.g. review by Hodgdon and Kaler (2007), Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 12: 121-128. Hydrotropes do not display a critical concentration above which self-aggregation occurs as found for surfactants and lipids forming miceller, lamellar or other well defined meso-phases. Instead, many hydrotropes show a continuous-type aggregation process where the sizes of aggregates grow as concentration increases. However, many hydrotropes alter the phase behavior, stability, and colloidal properties of systems containing substances of polar and non-polar character, including mixtures of water, oil, surfactants, and polymers. Hydrotropes are classically used across industries from pharma, personal care, food, to technical applications. Use of hydrotropes in detergent compositions allow for example more concentrated formulations of surfactants (as in the process of compacting liquid detergents by removing water) without inducing undesired phenomena such as phase separation or high viscosity.

The detergent may contain from 0 to 10 wt %, such as from 0 to 5 wt %, 0.5 to 5 wt %, or from 3% to 5 wt %, of a hydrotrope. Any hydrotrope known in the art for use in detergents may be utilized. Non-limiting examples of hydrotropes include sodium benzenesulfonate, sodium p-toluene sulfonate (STS), sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS), sodium cumene sulfonate (SCS), sodium cymene sulfonate, amine oxides, alcohols and polyglycolethers, sodium hydroxynaphthoate, sodium hydroxynaphthalene sulfonate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, and combinations thereof.

When a builder is used, the cleaning composition will typically comprise from 0 to 65 wt %, at least 1 wt %, from 2 to 60 wt % or from 5 to 10 wt % builder. In a dish wash cleaning composition, the level of builder is typically 40 to 65 wt % or 50 to 65 wt %. The composition may be substantially free of builder; substantially free means “no deliberately added” zeolite and/or phosphate. Typical zeolite builders include zeolite A, zeolite P and zeolite MAP. A typical phosphate builder is sodium tri-polyphosphate.

The builder and/or co-builder may particularly be a chelating agent that forms water-soluble complexes with Ca and Mg.

**Form of the Detergent Composition**

The detergent compositions described herein are advantageously employed for example, in laundry applications for private house hold as well as in industrial and institutional cleaning. The compositions of the invention are in particular solid or liquid cleaning and/or treatment compositions. In one aspect the invention relates to a composition, wherein the form of the composition is selected from the group consisting of a regular, compact or concentrated liquid; a gel; a paste; a soap bar; a regular or a compacted powder; a granulated solid; a homogenous or a multilayer tablet with two or more layers (same or different phases); a pouch having one or more compartments; a single or a multi-compartment unit dose form; or any combination thereof.

The form of the composition may separate the components physically from each other in compartments such as e.g. water dissolvable pouches or in different layers of tablets. Thereby negative storage interaction between components can be avoided. Different dissolution profiles of each of the compartments can also give rise to delayed dissolution of selected components in the wash solution.

Pouches can be configured as single or multicompartments. It can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable for hold the composition, e.g. without allowing the release of the composition to release of the composition from the pouch prior to water contact. The pouch is made from water soluble film which encloses an inner volume. Said inner volume can be divided into compartments of the pouch. Preferred films are polymeric materials preferably polymers which are formed into a film or sheet. Preferred polymers, copolymers or derivates thereof are selected polyacrylates, and water soluble acrylate copolymers, methyl cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, sodium dextrin, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, malto dextrin, poly methacrylates, most preferably polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Preferably the level of polymer in the film for example PVA is at least about 60%. Preferred average molecular weight will typically be about 20,000 to about 150,000. Films can also be of blended compositions comprising hydrolytically degradable and water soluble polymer blends such as polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol (known under the Trade reference M8630 as sold by MonoSol LLC, Indiana, USA) plus plasticisers like glycerol, ethylene glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol and mixtures thereof. The pouches can comprise a solid laundry cleaning composition or part components and/or a liquid cleaning composition or part components separated by the water soluble film. The compartment for liquid components can be different in composition than compartments containing solids (US2009/0011970 A1).

The lipase variants comprised in the water-soluble film of the invention may be present as lipase particles. The lipase particles may even contain one or more Additional Enzymes, as described below.

Lipase particles are any form of lipase variant in a solid particulate form. That can be as lipase crystals, lipase precipitate, spray or freeze-dried lipase or any form of granulated lipase, either as a powder or a suspension in liquid. Typically the particle size, measured as equivalent spherical diameter (volume based average particle size), of the lipase particles is below 2 mm, preferably below 1 mm, below 0.5 mm, below 0.25 mm, or below 0.1 mm; and above 0.05 μm, preferably above 0.1 μm, above 0.5 μm, above 1 μm, above 5 μm or above 10 μm.

In a preferred embodiment, the particle size of the lipase particles is from 0.5 μm to 100 μm.

The lipase particles contain at least 1% w/w lipase protein, preferably at least 5% w/w lipase protein, at least 10% w/w lipase protein, at least 20% w/w lipase protein, at least 30% w/w lipase protein, at least 40% w/w lipase protein, at least 50% w/w lipase protein, at least 60% w/w lipase protein, at least 70% w/w lipase protein, at least 80% w/w lipase protein, or at least 90% w/w lipase protein.

In a preferred embodiment, the lipase particles are lipase crystals, or the lipase protein is on a crystalline form.

Enzyme crystallization may be carried out in a number of ways, as known in the art (e.g., as described in WO91/09943 or WO94/22903).

The lipase may be formulated in the lipase particle as known in the art for solid enzyme formulations, such as formulations for reducing dust, improving stability and/or modifying relase rate of the enzyme. The lipase particle may also be formulated in a matrix or coated with agents suppressing dissolution of the enzyme particle in the PVOH/film solution used for preparing the water-soluble film.

The lipase molecules on the surface of the lipase particles may also be cross-linked, like CLECs (Cross-Linked Enzyme Crystals) or CLEA (Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregate).

**Water-Soluble Film**

Water-soluble films, optional ingredients for use therein, and methods of making the same are well known in the art. In one class of embodiments, the water-soluble film includes PVOH. PVOH is a synthetic resin generally prepared by the alcoholysis, usually termed hydrolysis or saponification, of polyvinyl acetate. Fully hydrolyzed PVOH, wherein virtually all the acetate groups have been converted to alcohol groups, is a strongly hydrogen-bonded, highly crystalline polymer which dissolves only in hot water—greater than about 140° F. (60° C.). If a sufficient number of acetate groups are allowed to remain after the hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate, the PVOH polymer then being known as partially hydrolyzed, it is more weakly hydrogen-bonded and less crystalline and is soluble in cold water—less than about 50° F. (10° C.). An intermediate cold/hot water-soluble film can include, for example, intermediate partially-hydrolyzed PVOH (e.g., with degrees of hydrolysis of about 94% to about 98%), and is readily soluble only in warm water—e.g., rapid dissolution at temperatures of about 40° C. and greater. Both fully and partially hydrolyzed PVOH types are commonly referred to as PVOH homopolymers although the partially hydrolyzed type is technically a vinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate copolymer.

The degree of hydrolysis of the PVOH included in the water-soluble films of the present disclosure can be about 75% to about 99%. As the degree of hydrolysis is reduced, a film made from the resin will have reduced mechanical strength but faster solubility at temperatures below about 20° C. As the degree of hydrolysis increases, a film made from the resin will tend to be mechanically stronger and the thermoformability will tend to decrease. The degree of hydrolysis of the PVOH can be chosen such that the water-solubility of the resin is temperature dependent, and thus the solubility of a film made from the resin, compatibilizing agent, and additional ingredients is also influenced. In one class of embodiments the film is cold water-soluble. A cold water-soluble film, soluble in water at a temperature of less than 10° C., can include PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis in a range of about 75% to about 90%, or in a range of about 80% to about 90%, or in a range of about 85% to about 90%. In another class of embodiments the film is hot water-soluble. A hot water-soluble film, soluble in water at a temperature of at least about 60° C., can include PVOH with a degree of hydrolysis of at least about 98%.

Other film-forming resins for use in addition to or in an alternative to PVOH can include, but are not limited to, modified polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylates, water-soluble acrylate copolymers, polyacrylates, polyacryamides, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, pullulan, water-soluble natural polymers including, but not limited to, guar gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan, and starch, water-soluble polymer derivatives including, but not limited to, ethoxylated starch and hydroxypropylated starch, poly(sodium acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate), polymonomethylmaleate, copolymers thereof, and combinations of any of the foregoing. In one class of embodiments, the film-forming resin is a terpolymer consisting of vinyl alcohol, vinyl acetate, and sodium acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate. Unexpectedly, water-soluble films based on a vinyl alcohol, vinyl acetate, and sodium acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate terpolymer have demonstrated a high percent recovery of enzyme.

The water-soluble resin can be included in the water-soluble film in any suitable amount, for example an amount in a range of about 35 wt % to about 90 wt %. The preferred weight ratio of the amount of the water-soluble resin as compared to the combined amount of all enzymes, enzyme stabilizers, and secondary additives can be any suitable ratio, for example a ratio in a range of about 0.5 to about 5, or about 1 to 3, or about 1 to 2.

Water-soluble resins for use in the films described herein (including, but not limited to PVOH resins) can be characterized by any suitable viscosity for the desired film properties, optionally a viscosity in a range of about 5.0 to about 30.0 cP, or about 10.0 cP to about 25 cP. The viscosity of a PVOH resin is determined by measuring a freshly made solution using a Brookfield LV type viscometer with UL adapter as described in British Standard EN ISO 15023-2:2006 Annex E Brookfield Test method. It is international practice to state the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions at 20° C. All PVOH viscosities specified herein in cP should be understood to refer to the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution at 20° C., unless specified otherwise.

It is well known in the art that the viscosity of a PVOH resin is correlated with the weight average molecular weight (w) of the same PVOH resin, and often the viscosity is used as a proxy for w. Thus, the weight average molecular weight of the water-soluble resin optionally can be in a range of about 35,000 to about 190,000, or about 80,000 to about 160,000. The molecular weight of the resin need only be sufficient to enable it to be molded by suitable techniques to form a thin plastic film.

The water-soluble films according to the present disclosure may include other optional additive ingredients including, but not limited to, plasticizers, surfactants, defoamers, film formers, antiblocking agents, internal release agents, anti-yellowing agents and other functional ingredients, for example in amounts suitable for their intended purpose.

Water is recognized as a very efficient plasticizer for PVOH and other polymers; however, the volatility of water makes its utility limited since polymer films need to have at least some resistance (robustness) to a variety of ambient conditions including low and high relative humidity. Glycerin is much less volatile than water and has been well established as an effective plasticizer for PVOH and other polymers. Glycerin or other such liquid plasticizers by themselves can cause surface “sweating” and greasiness if the level used in the film formulation is too high. This can lead to problems in a film such as unacceptable feel to the hand of the consumer and even blocking of the film on the roll or in stacks of sheets if the sweating is not mitigated in some manner, such as powdering of the surface. This could be characterized as over plasticization. However, if too little plasticizer is added to the film the film may lack sufficient ductility and flexibility for many end uses, for example to be converted into a final use format such as pouches.

Plasticizers for use in water-soluble films of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, sorbitol, glycerol, diglycerol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, diethyleneglycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethyleneglycol, polyethylene glycols up to MW 400, 2 methyl 1, 3 propane diol, lactic acid, monoacetin, triacetin, triethyl citrate, 1,3-butanediol, trimethylolpropane (TMP), polyether triol, and combinations thereof. Polyols, as described above, are generally useful as plasticizers. As less plasticizer is used, the film can become more brittle, whereas as more plasticizer is used the film can lose tensile strength. Plasticizers can be included in the water-soluble films in an amount in a range of about 25 phr to about 50 phr, or from about 30 phr to about 45 phr, or from about 32 phr to about 42 phr, for example.

Surfactants for use in water-soluble films are well known in the art. Optionally, surfactants are included to aid in the dispersion of the resin solution upon casting. Suitable surfactants for water-soluble films of the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, dialkyl sulfosuccinates, lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol, lactylic esters of fatty acids, sodium alkyl sulfates, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 60, polysorbate 65, polysorbate 80, alkyl polyethylene glycol ethers, lecithin, acetylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, acetylated esters of fatty acids, myristyl dimethylamine oxide, trimethyl tallow alkyl ammonium chloride, quaternary ammonium compounds, salts thereof and combinations of any of the forgoing. Thus, surfactants can be included in the water-soluble films in an amount of less than about 2 phr, for example less than about 1 phr, or less than about 0.5 phr, for example.

One type of secondary component contemplated for use is a defoamer. Defoamers can aid in coalescing of foam bubbles. Suitable defoamers for use in water-soluble films according to the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, hydrophobic silicas, for example silicon dioxide or fumed silica in fine particle sizes, including Foam Blast® defoamers available from Emerald Performance Materials, including Foam Blast® 327, Foam Blast® UVD, Foam Blast® 163, Foam Blast® 269, Foam Blast® 338, Foam Blast® 290, Foam Blast® 332, Foam Blast® 349, Foam Blast® 550 and Foam Blast® 339, which are proprietary, non-mineral oil defoamers. In embodiments, defoamers can be used in an amount of 0.5 phr, or less, for example, 0.05 phr, 0.04 phr, 0.03 phr, 0.02 phr, or 0.01 phr. Preferably, significant amounts of silicon dioxide will be avoided, in order to avoid stress whitening.

Processes for making water-soluble articles, including films, include casting, blow-molding, extrusion and blown extrusion, as known in the art. One contemplated class of embodiments is characterized by the water-soluble film described herein being formed by casting, for example, by admixing the ingredients described herein with water to create an aqueous mixture, for example a solution with optionally dispersed solids, applying the mixture to a surface, and drying off water to create a film. Similarly, other compositions can be formed by drying the mixture while it is confined in a desired shape.

In one contemplated class of embodiments, the water-soluble film is formed by casting a water-soluble mixture wherein the water-soluble mixture is prepared according to the steps of:

(a) providing a mixture of water-soluble resin, water, and any optional additives excluding plasticizers;

(b) boiling the mixture for 30 minutes;

(c) degassing the mixture in an oven at a temperature of at least 40° C.; optionally in a range of 40° C. to 70° C., e.g., about 65° C.;

(d) adding one or more enzymes, plasticizer, and additional water to the mixture at a temperature of 65° C. or less; and

(e) stirring the mixture without vortex until the mixture appears substantially uniform in color and consistency; optionally for a time period in a range of 30 minutes to 90 minutes, optionally at least 1 hour; and

(f) casting the mixture promptly after the time period of stirring (e.g., within 4 hours, or 2 hours, or 1 hour).

If the enzyme is added to the mixture too early, e.g., with the secondary additives or resin, the activity of the enzyme may decrease. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that boiling of the mixture with the enzyme leads to the enzyme denaturing and storing in solution for extended periods of time also leads to a reduction in enzyme activity.

In one class of embodiments, high enzyme activity is maintained in the water-soluble films according to the present disclosure by drying the films quickly under moderate to mild conditions. As used herein, drying quickly refers to a drying time of less than 24 hours, optionally less than 12 hours, optionally less than 8 hours, optionally less than 2 hours, optionally less than 1 hour, optionally less than 45 minutes, optionally less than 30 minutes, optionally less than 20 minutes, optionally less than 10 minutes, for example in a range of about 6 minutes to about 10 minutes, or 8 minutes. As used herein, moderate to mild conditions refer to drying temperatures of less than 170° F. (77° C.), optionally in a range of about 150° F. to about 170° F. (about 66° C. to about 77° C.), e.g., 165° F. (74° C.). As the drying temperature increases, the enzymes tend to denature faster, whereas as the drying temperature decreases, the drying time increases, thus exposing the enzymes to solution for an extended period of time.

The film is useful for creating a packet to contain a composition, for example laundry or dishwashing compositions, thereby forming a pouch. The film described herein can also be used to make a packet with two or more compartments made of the same film or in combination with films of other polymeric materials. Additional films can, for example, be obtained by casting, blow-molding, extrusion or blown extrusion of the same or a different polymeric material, as known in the art. In one type of embodiment, the polymers, copolymers or derivatives thereof suitable for use as the additional film are selected from polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides, polyacrylic acid, cellulose, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, cellulose amides, polyvinyl acetates, polycarboxylic acids and salts, polyaminoacids or peptides, polyamides, polyacrylamide, copolymers of maleic/acrylic acids, polysaccharides including starch and gelatin, natural gums such as xanthan, and carrageenans. For example, polymers can be selected from polyacrylates and water-soluble acrylate copolymers, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, dextrin, ethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, and combinations thereof, or selected from polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and combinations thereof.

The pouches and/or packets of the present disclosure comprise at least one sealed compartment. Thus the pouches may comprise a single compartment or multiple compartments. The pouches may have regions with and without enzymes. In embodiments including multiple compartments, each compartment may contain identical and/or different compositions. In turn, the compositions may take any suitable form including, but not limited to liquid, solid and combinations thereof (e.g., a solid suspended in a liquid). In some embodiments, the pouches comprises a first, second and third compartment, each of which respectively contains a different first, second and third composition. In some embodiments, the compositions may be visually distinct as described in EP 2258820.

The compartments of multi-compartment pouches and/or packets may be of the same or different size(s) and/or volume(s). The compartments of the present multi-compartment pouches can be separate or conjoined in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the second and/or third and/or subsequent compartments are superimposed on the first compartment. In one embodiment, the third compartment may be superimposed on the second compartment, which is in turn superimposed on the first compartment in a sandwich configuration. Alternatively the second and third compartments may be superimposed on the first compartment. However it is also equally envisaged that the first, second and optionally third and subsequent compartments may be attached to one another in a side by side relationship. The compartments may be packed in a string, each compartment being individually separable by a perforation line. Hence each compartment may be individually torn-off from the remainder of the string by the end-user.

In some embodiments, multi-compartment pouches and/or packets include three compartments consisting of a large first compartment and two smaller compartments. The second and third smaller compartments are superimposed on the first larger compartment. The size and geometry of the compartments are chosen such that this arrangement is achievable. The geometry of the compartments may be the same or different. In some embodiments the second and optionally third compartment each has a different geometry and shape as compared to the first compartment. In these embodiments, the second and optionally third compartments are arranged in a design on the first compartment. The design may be decorative, educative, or illustrative, for example to illustrate a concept or instruction, and/or used to indicate origin of the product. In some embodiments, the first compartment is the largest compartment having two large faces sealed around the perimeter, and the second compartment is smaller covering less than about 75%, or less than about 50% of the surface area of one face of the first compartment. In embodiments in which there is a third compartment, the aforementioned structure may be the same but the second and third compartments cover less than about 60%, or less than about 50%, or less than about 45% of the surface area of one face of the first compartment.

The pouches and/or packets of the present disclosure may comprise one or more different films. For example, in single compartment embodiments, the packet may be made from one wall that is folded onto itself and sealed at the edges, or alternatively, two walls that are sealed together at the edges. In multiple compartment embodiments, the packet may be made from one or more films such that any given packet compartment may comprise walls made from a single film or multiple films having differing compositions. In one embodiment, a multi-compartment pouch comprises at least three walls: an outer upper wall; an outer lower wall; and a partitioning wall. The outer upper wall and the outer lower wall are generally opposing and form the exterior of the pouch. The partitioning wall is interior to the pouch and is secured to the generally opposing outer walls along a seal line. The partitioning wall separates the interior of the multi-compartment pouch into at least a first compartment and a second compartment. In one class of embodiments, the partitioning wall may be the only enzyme containing film thereby minimizing the exposure of the consumer to the enzymes.

Pouches and packets may be made using any suitable equipment and method. For example, single compartment pouches may be made using vertical form filling, horizontal form filling, or rotary drum filling techniques commonly known in the art. Such processes may be either continuous or intermittent. The film may be dampened, and/or heated to increase the malleability thereof. The method may also involve the use of a vacuum to draw the film into a suitable mold. The vacuum drawing the film into the mold can be applied for about 0.2 to about 5 seconds, or about 0.3 to about 3, or about 0.5 to about 1.5 seconds, once the film is on the horizontal portion of the surface. This vacuum can be such that it provides an under-pressure in a range of 10 mbar to 1000 mbar, or in a range of 100 mbar to 600 mbar, for example.

The molds, in which packets may be made, can have any shape, length, width and depth, depending on the required dimensions of the pouches. The molds may also vary in size and shape from one to another, if desirable. For example, the volume of the final pouches may be about 5 ml to about 300 ml, or about 10 to 150 ml, or about 20 to about 100 ml, and that the mold sizes are adjusted accordingly.

In one embodiment, the packet includes a first and a second sealed compartment. The second compartment is in a generally superposed relationship with the first sealed compartment such that the second sealed compartment and the first sealed compartment share a partitioning wall interior to the pouch.

In one embodiment, the packet including a first and a second compartment further includes a third sealed compartment. The third sealed compartment is in a generally superposed relationship with the first sealed compartment such that the third sealed compartment and the first sealed compartment share a partitioning wall interior to the pouch.

In various embodiments, the first composition and the second composition are selected from one of the following combinations: liquid, liquid; liquid, powder; powder, powder; and powder, liquid.

In various embodiments, the first, second and third compositions are selected from one of the following combinations: solid, liquid, liquid and liquid, liquid, liquid.

In one embodiment, the single compartment or plurality of sealed compartments contains a composition. The plurality of compartments may each contain the same or a different composition. The composition is selected from a liquid, solid or combination thereof.

Heat can be applied to the film in the process commonly known as thermoforming. The heat may be applied using any suitable means. For example, the film may be heated directly by passing it under a heating element or through hot air, prior to feeding it onto a surface or once on a surface. Alternatively, it may be heated indirectly, for example by heating the surface or applying a hot item onto the film. The film can be heated using an infrared light. The film may be heated to a temperature of at least 50° C., for example about 50 to about 150° C., about 50 to about 120° C., about 60 to about 130° C., about 70 to about 120° C., or about 60 to about 90° C.

Alternatively, the film can be wetted by any suitable means, for example directly by spraying a wetting agent (including water, a solution of the film composition, a plasticizer for the film composition, or any combination of the foregoing) onto the film, prior to feeding it onto the surface or once on the surface, or indirectly by wetting the surface or by applying a wet item onto the film.

Once a film has been heated and/or wetted, it may be drawn into an appropriate mold, preferably using a vacuum. The film can be thermoformed with a draw ratio of at least about 1.5, for example, and optionally up to a draw ratio of 2, for example. The filling of the molded film can be accomplished by utilizing any suitable means. In some embodiments, the most preferred method will depend on the product form and required speed of filling. In some embodiments, the molded film is filled by in-line filling techniques. The filled, open packets are then closed forming the pouches, using a second film, by any suitable method. This may be accomplished while in horizontal position and in continuous, constant motion. The closing may be accomplished by continuously feeding a second film, preferably water-soluble film, over and onto the open packets and then preferably sealing the first and second film together, typically in the area between the molds and thus between the packets.

Any suitable method of sealing the packet and/or the individual compartments thereof may be utilized. Non-limiting examples of such means include heat sealing, solvent welding, solvent or wet sealing, and combinations thereof. The water-soluble packet and/or the individual compartments thereof can be heat sealed at a temperature of at least 200° F. (93° C.), for example in a range of about 220° F. (about 105° C.) to about 290° F. (about 145° C.), or about 230° F. (about 110° C.) to about 280° F. (about 140° C.). Typically, only the area which is to form the seal is treated with heat or solvent. The heat or solvent can be applied by any method, typically on the closing material, and typically only on the areas which are to form the seal. If solvent or wet sealing or welding is used, it may be preferred that heat is also applied. Preferred wet or solvent sealing/welding methods include selectively applying solvent onto the area between the molds, or on the closing material, by for example, spraying or printing this onto these areas, and then applying pressure onto these areas, to form the seal. Sealing rolls and belts as described above (optionally also providing heat) can be used, for example.

The formed pouches may then be cut by a cutting device. Cutting can be accomplished using any known method. It may be preferred that the cutting is also done in continuous manner, and preferably with constant speed and preferably while in horizontal position. The cutting device can, for example, be a sharp item, or a hot item, or a laser, whereby in the latter cases, the hot item or laser ‘burns’ through the film/sealing area.

The different compartments of a multi-compartment pouches may be made together in a side-by-side style wherein the resulting, cojoined pouches may or may not be separated by cutting. Alternatively, the compartments can be made separately.

In some embodiments, pouches may be made according to a process including the steps of:

a) forming a first compartment (as described above);

b) forming a recess within some or all of the closed compartment formed in step (a), to generate a second molded compartment superposed above the first compartment;

c) filling and closing the second compartments by means of a third film;

d) sealing the first, second and third films; and

e) cutting the films to produce a multi-compartment pouch.

The recess formed in step (b) may be achieved by applying a vacuum to the compartment prepared in step (a).

In some embodiments, second, and/or third compartment(s) can be made in a separate step and then combined with the first compartment as described in EP 2088187 or WO 2009/152031.

In other embodiments, pouches may be made according to a process including the steps of:

a) forming a first compartment, optionally using heat and/or vacuum, using a first film on a first forming machine;

b) filling the first compartment with a first composition;

c) on a second forming machine, deforming a second film, optionally using heat and vacuum, to make a second and optionally third molded compartment;

d) filling the second and optionally third compartments;

e) sealing the second and optionally third compartment using a third film;

f) placing the sealed second and optionally third compartments onto the first compartment;

g) sealing the first, second and optionally third compartments; and

h) cutting the films to produce a multi-compartment pouch.

The first and second forming machines may be selected based on their suitability to perform the above process. In some embodiments, the first forming machine is preferably a horizontal forming machine, and the second forming machine is preferably a rotary drum forming machine, preferably located above the first forming machine.

It should be understood that by the use of appropriate feed stations, it may be possible to manufacture multi-compartment pouches incorporating a number of different or distinctive compositions and/or different or distinctive liquid, gel or paste compositions.

## EXAMPLES

### Materials

Chemicals used as buffers and substrates were commercial products of at least reagent grade unless otherwise noted.

### Example 1: Variant Generation, Transformation and Expression

The gene of Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RmL) SEQ ID No: 1 was cloned into the expression vector, pENI2516 and transformed in the expression host, Aspergillus oryzae ToC1512.

### Purification of RmL WT Controls: RmL WT and RmL WT Pur

Culture supernatant from Aspergillus oryzae broth was clarified by vacuum filtration using a combination of Seitz filter (Prod. No: K250, PALL India corporation) and WHATMAN glass filter GF/F grade (Prod. No:1825-25, Whatman-GE Healthcare) in a Buchner funnel (Prod. No: PW90, J Brand) followed by a 0.2 u sterile filtration on a TFF system (Prod. No:56-4101-81, GE Healthcare), applying a transmembrane pressure of approximately 15 psi.

A decylamine column was pre-equilibrated with wash buffer 50 mM HEPES, pH7.0+1M NaCl buffer. 1M NaCl was added to the clarified culture supernatant which was applied on a decylamine agarose column (15×200 mm, bed volume 25 mL) at a linear flow rate of 271 cm/hr. Wash buffer was then applied until OD at 280 nm of the flowthrough was below 0.1 Absorbance Unit. Elution was carried out using 50 mM HEPES, pH7. The RmL protein does not bind on decylamine agarose and elutes in the flowthrough fraction.

UNOQ anion exchange column was pre-equilibrated with wash buffer 50 mM HEPES, pH7.0. The flowthrough collected from decylamine agarose column was buffer exchanged against 50 mM HEPES, pH7, and applied onto the UNOQ column (15×200 mm, bed volume 25 mL) at a linear flow rate of 271 cm/hr. The column was washed with wash buffer until the OD at 280 nm of the flowtrough was below 0.1 absorbance Unit. Elution of RmL bound to the column was conducted using 50 mM HEPES, pH 7+1M NaCl.

Analysis on Native PAGE as described in example 2 showed the presence of a dominating High Molecular Weight (HMVV) band and a Low Molecular Weight (LMVV) band. Zymogram Analysis as described in example 3 demonstrated that the hydrolytic activity was localized in the LMW band.

A more active preparation of the RmL control (RmL WT pur) was obtained by purifying the RML WT control on a decylamine agarose column. This preparation which showed the presence of a LMW band had no detectable HMW band.

### Propeptide Variant Generation

The following method was used to generate variants with substitutions, insertions or deletions involving one to four amino acids in the propeptide region in the RmL gene.

A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) was carried out using a single mutagenic primer of 20-30 base pairs with the desired amino acid change (substitution/deletion). The primer used for mutagenesis was designed such that the mutation lies in the middle of the oligonucleotide with sufficient flanking residues (9-15 base pairs). During the PCR reaction, the primers generated mutant single-stranded DNA. The PCR product was then treated with DpnI restriction enzyme for 6 hours in a PCR machine at 37° C. DpnI digested the methylated or the parental template DNA whereas the newly formed mutated DNA strands that were non-methylated remain intact. The intact newly synthesized single-stranded PCR product was then used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells, which synthesizes the complementary strand for the PCR product.

To generate variants with deletions longer than ten or more amino acids, the following method was used.

PCR was carried out with the respective forward and reverse primers to amplify the whole plasmid DNA excluding the deletions. The primers were phosphorylated prior to the PCR reaction to aid in easier ligation of the generated PCR product into a nicked circular plasmid, which was then transformed in E. coli.

Plasmid DNA was isolated from a single isolated transformant and sent for sequence analysis, which confirmed the presence of the desired mutation. The sequence confirmed plasmid DNA was transformed in A. oryzae ToC1512 by protoplast mode of transformation. The transformants were screened for protein expression in small scale by inoculation of spores in 2 mL expression media (M400: 50 g/L Maltodextrin; 2 g/L Magnesium sulfate; 2 g/L Potassium dihydrogen phosphate; 4 g/L Citric acid monohydrous; 8 g/L Yeast Extract; 2 g/L Urea; 0.5 ml/L tracemetal (KU6) solution; and 0.5 g/L Calcium chloride) in 12-well culture plates and grown stationary for 4 days at 34° C., after which protein expression was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and subsequently on Native PAGE and zymogram analysis. The expressing colony was then streaked on COVE-N-agar slants from which shake-flask fermentation was carried out in M400 media in 1 L baffled shake-flasks for 4 days at 34° C., 180 rpm. Protein expression was analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Once expression was confirmed, the fermentation broth was given for protein purification.

The polymerase used for the PCR reaction was Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Cat. No.: F530L. DpnI was from New England Biolabs (Cat. No.: R0176S). The PCR machine was from Applied Biosystems (Model no. GeneAmp9700). Plasmid DNA was isolated using Sigma GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Cat. No.: PLN350-1KT)].

### Example 2: Native PAGE

The native PAGE was casted by first pouring the Resolving gel (4.0 mL 30% Acrylamide (Acrylamide-Bis-acrylamide solution); 2.5 mL 1.5M Tris (pH8.8); 0.1 mL 10% Ammonium per sulphate (APS); 0.004 mL TEMED; 3.3 mL water), followed by overlaying with butanol-water and allowing to polymerize for 30-45 minutes. The butanol-water was washed off and then the stacking gel (1.7 mL 30% Acrylamide (Acrylamide-Bis-acrylamide solution); 1.25 mL 1.5M Tris (pH6.8); 0.1 mL 10% Ammonium per sulphate (APS); 0.01 mL TEMED; 6.8 mL water), was poured over the polymerized resolving gel, immediately followed by insertion of the comb. This was allowed to polymerize for approx. 15 minutes. The protein sample (culture supernatant) was mixed with loading dye (5× composition (2 mL): 0.62 mL 1M Tris pH6.8; 0.1 mL 1% Bromophenol blue; 1.0 mL Glycerol; 0.28 mL Water) and loaded in to the wells of the native PAGE. The gel was run in SDS-free electrophoresis buffer (3.0 g Tris base; 14.4 g Glycine; water up to 1 L) at constant current of 25 mA.

### Example 3: Temperature Stability Assay (TSA)

Thermal shift (Tm) was determined by measuring the protein thermal stability using a fluorescent protein binding dye (SYPRO Orange; SIGMA S5692). SYPRO Orange binds nonspecifically to hydrophobic surfaces, when the protein unfolds the exposed hydrophobic surfaces bind the dye, resulting in an increase in fluorescence. The stability curve and its midpoint value (melting temperature, Tm) are obtained by gradually increasing the temperature to unfold the protein and measuring the fluorescence at each point.

A fluorescence-based thermal shift assay can be performed on instruments that combine sample temperature control and dye fluorescence detection (7500 FAST real time PCR Applied biosystem). The instrument heats the sample from 25° C. to 96° C. in buffer 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.

10 uL of RML sample (equivalent to 5 uM; Conc. 0.2 mg/mL) was mixed with 17.5 uL of buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH7) and 2.5 uL of 2.5×TAMRA dye. Total reaction volume was kept around 30 uL only and is prepared at room temperature. Finally the plate is centrifuged and covered with Applied biosystem micro AMP optical adhesive film (4311971).

Reaction mixtures were prepared in 96-well Applied biosystem micro AMP Fast optical reaction plate (43669320).

Based on the Tm (calculated by Protein Thermal Shift Software; trade mark applied biosystem) from each fluorescence profile (Boltzmann method) and also the Tm of the dFluorescence (derivative method). The derivative Tm values are taken from the top of the peak in the derivative plot, while the Boltzmann Tm values are taken from the inflection point of the fluorescence plot. The variants with higher thermal stability were picked when compared with the wild type Tm. Melting temperatures were determined at an accuracy of approximately +/−0.2° C.

### Example 4: Zymogram Analysis

The Native PAGE is taken out and placed on a suitable plate with substrate; in this case, an olive oil agarose plate with brilliant green was used. The gel should not be stained. To differentiate the proteins, the samples were run in two sets, one set placed on the substrate plate and the other stained and de-stained to check the banding pattern. The plate was incubated for appropriate time (2 h) and at appropriate temperature (25° C.) till zone of color/clearance is observed.

### Example 5: Decylamine Agarose Chromatography

Prior to purification on decylamine agarose clarified culture supernatant was made from the Aspergillus oryzae broth by vacuum filtration using a combination of Seitz filter (prod. No. K250, PALL India corporation) and WHATMAN glass filter GF/F grade (prod. No. 1825-25, WHATMAN-GE Healthcare) in a Buchner funnel (prod. No. PW90, J Brand) followed by a sterile filtration using Supor®-200 0.2 u filter (prod. No. 60301, PALL corporation) on a vacuum filtration unit (prod. No. 50060, TARSONS).

Decylamine agarose column was pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES; pH7; 2M NaCl). The clarified culture supernatant was 1:1 diluted with wash buffer to make a final NaCl concentration 1M. 200 mL of diluted sample was applied on a decylamine agarose column (10×200 mm, bed volume 6 mL) at a linear flow rate of 115 cm/hr. The unbound or weakly bound protein was removed by washing the column with wash buffer until the OD at 280 nm was below 0.1 absorbance units. The first elution was conducted using elution buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES; pH7). The second elution was conducted using elution buffer 2 (50% EtOH; 10 mM HEPES; pH7).

### Example 6: Relative Wash Performance

**Automatic Mechanical Stress Assay (AMSA)**

Washing experiments were performed using Automatic Mechanical Stress Assay (AMSA) in order to assess the wash performance in laundry. The AMSA plate has a number of slots for test solutions and a lid firmly squeezing the laundry sample, the textile to be washed against all the slot openings. During the washing time, the plate, test solutions, textile and lid were vigorously shaken to bring the test solution in contact with the textile and apply mechanical stress in a regular, periodic oscillating manner. For further description see WO02/42740 especially the paragraph “Special method embodiments” at page 23-24.

The laundry experiments were conducted in glycine buffers at different pH and in Model Detergents with different surfactant level. The experimental conditions are specified below:

Detergents/buffers: 50 mM glycine buffer pH8


- - 50 mM glycine buffer pH9
  - 50 mM glycine buffer pH10
  - 3.3 g/L Detergent 0% surfactant, 50 mM glycine buffer pH8
  - 3.3 g/L Detergent 10% surfactant, 50 mM glycine buffer pH8
  - 3.3 g/L Detergent 20% surfactant, 50 mM glycine buffer pH8
  - 3.3 g/L Detergent 60% surfactant, 50 mM glycine buffer pH8
  - 3.3 g/L Detergent 100% surfactant, 50 mM glycine buffer pH8  
    Test solution volume: 160 uL  
    Wash time: 15 minutes

**Temperature: 25° C.**

Water hardness: 15° dH

Lipase dosage: 0 ppm or 1 ppm

Test material: Cream turmeric stain according to WO06/125437

Final adjustments to the specified pH were done with NaOH or citric acid. Water hardness was adjusted to 15° dH by addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Ca2+:Mg2+=4:1) to the test system.

After washing the textiles were flushed in tap water and excess water was removed from the textiles using filter paper and immediately thereafter the textiles were dried at 85° C. for 5 min.

The wash performance was measured as the color change of the washed soiled textile. The soil was cream mixed with turmeric. Turmeric contains the colorant curcumin, which function as a pH indicator by having pH dependent color change. Lipase activity leads to release of free fatty acids from the cream acylglycerides and this leads to pH decrease and thereby color change of the curcumin pH indicator. Lipase wash performance can therefore be expressed as the extent of color change of light reflected-emitted from the washed soiled textile when illuminated with white light.

Color measurements were made with a professional flatbed scanner (EPSON EXPRESSION 10000XL, Atea A/S, Lautrupvang 6, 2750 Ballerup, Denmark), which was used to capture an image of the washed soiled textile. To extract a value for the light intensity from the scanned images, 24-bit pixel values from the image were converted into values for red, green and blue (RGB).

Color change due to lipase activity was measured as the increase in the reflection-emitting of green light (G) relative to the sum of reflected-emitted blue (B) and red (R) light. The wash performance (RP(Wash)) of a lipase relative to a reference lipase (RmL WT) was calculated as: RP(Wash)=(G/(B+R)(tested lipase)−G/(B+R)(no enzyme))/(G/(B+R)(lipase ref.)−G/(B+R)(no enzyme)).
