    "abstract": "Giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors have been shown to be among the most sensitive biosensors reported. While high-density and scalable sensor arrays are desirable for achieving multiplex detection, scalability remains challenging because of long data acquisition time using conventional readout methods. In this paper, we present a scalable magnetoresistive biosensor array with an on-chip magnetic field generator and a high-speed data acquisition method. The on-chip field generators enable magnetic correlated double sampling (MCDS) and global chopper stabilization to suppress 1/ f noise and offset. A measurement with the proposed system takes only 20 ms, approximately 50\u00d7 faster than conventional frequency domain analysis. A corresponding time domain temperature correction technique is also presented and shown to be able to remove temperature dependence from the measured signal without extra measurements or reference sensors. Measurements demonstrate detection of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) at a signal level as low as 6.92 ppm. The small form factor enables the proposed platform to be portable as well as having high sensitivity and rapid readout, desirable features for next generation diagnostic systems, especially in point-of-care (POC) settings.",

                "The advent of biomedical technologies has brought an increased interest in discovering new methods to identify diseases earlier where treatments are often more effective, healthcare costs are lower, and patient outcomes are generally better. Over the past few decades, substantial effort has been made to identify new prognostic biomarkers1\u20133 and improve measurement sensitivity4\u20137. Magnetic biosensors have been studied extensively8\u201312, and giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors in particular, have drawn considerable research interest because of their high transduction efficiency and the simple fact that biological samples are rarely magnetic, thus ensuring a low background signal, resulting in an extremely low, femto-Molar limit of detection13. Furthermore, GMR biosensors are matrix-insensitive13, capable of multiplexing14,15, and can be made temperature-insensitive16. With an increasing amount of research dedicated towards extending such biosensor applications, including the detection of DNA17\u201321, cancer biomarkers13, and cardiovascular biomarkers15, there is also a growing need for scalable, high-density biosensor arrays. Such arrays allow for simultaneous detection of many biomarkers from a single biological sample, enabling personalized healthcare, while saving time and reagent cost. Ideally, these high-density biosensor arrays would have a short readout time to enable kinetic monitoring, high sensitivity, and low power consumption. Yet the desire for large array size and short readout time are often at odds with each other. Most prior work has compromised the short readout time in favor of large array size.",
                "The scalability of current magnetoresistive biosensors is primarily limited by its data acquisition speed. Conventional design methodology utilizes spectral analysis to measure minute signal changes, essentially lock-in detection with a narrow acquisition bandwidth15,22\u201326. This has been shown to accommodate arrays of up to 256 sensors24, but it suffers from long recording time (500\u2009ms per readout channel) and requires even longer processing time. This long data acquisition time results in a significant time penalty for reading out the entire array (usually a few seconds per scan) and hinders the ability to monitor real-time reaction kinetics. Techniques such as multi-carrier excitation have been shown to reduce the readout time but are limited by the increased dynamic range and are sensitive to distortion in the readout electronics27\u201329. A recent study showed that time-domain analysis with magnetic correlated double sampling (MCDS) can be effectively utilized to measure signals from the sensor arrays30. However, the usage of an external Helmholtz coil and power amplifier requires a significant power consumption as well as a large form factor.",
                "In this work, we present a scalable magnetoresistive biosensor array with on-chip pulsed excitation and a readout circuit employing the MCDS technique, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a01. The system consists of a GMR spin-valve (SV) sensor array with field generating strip line inductors embedded on the same chip directly under the sensors, and a custom analog front-end (AFE). The on-chip strip lines eliminate the need for a bulky external coil and its corresponding power amplifier while also making this design much more scalable. The on-chip field generators magnetize the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) tethered to the surface by a sandwich immunoassay (capture antibody, analyte of interest, and detection antibody conjugated to an MNP). The captured MNPs induce a local magnetic field that is sensed by the underlying magnetoresistance (MR) sensor. This MR change is detected using custom designed electronics with the MCDS technique to suppress the flicker (1/f) noise and offset, thus allowing one to extract the minute signal of interest in the time domain and reducing the readout time while preserving the same level of sensitivity. To perform MCDS, an excitation field generated by a strip line inductor implanted under the sensors is pulsed biphasically and the sensor resistance is measured twice within a very short period of time. The first measurement is taken with excitation field on, and the second, off. The first measurement contains the signal of interest (\u0394MR) along with the 1/f noise and offset of the sensor and readout electronics, while the second measurement has only the 1/f noise and offset. By subtracting the second measurement from the first, the correlated noise and offset are eliminated, leaving only the MR change induced by the captured MNPs. In a biological assay, the temperature can change significantly, and usually induces signal artifacts that can be orders of magnitude larger than the signal of interest. A temperature correction technique is proposed to remove this dependence without using extra sensors or redundant measurements. Binding curves obtained from a magnetic assay demonstrate a minimum detectable signal of 6.92\u2009ppm (~3,900 MNPs) and strong linearity in 20\u2009ms.Figure 1Overview of the proposed magnetic correlated double sampling technique with a GMR biosensor. A set of capture antibody, analyte of interest, and detection antibody form a sandwich structure tethering MNPs to the surface. When current is passed through the field wire, an excitation field is generated (left), the output voltage is a superposition of the signal, 1/f noise, and offset. When there is no excitation (middle), the output voltage measures only the 1/f noise and the offset. If the time difference between the two measurements is sufficiently small, 1/f noise and offsets are highly correlated so the subtraction of the two contains only the signal of interest (right)."

The sensor resistance was designed by combining multiple stripes of GMR SV sensors in a parallel and series configuration to yield a moderate ~1.8\u2009k\u2126 resistance with a large surface area (14,800\u2009\u00b5m2) to increase the dynamic range. The measured MR ratio of the film was 7% after deposition but degraded to 5% due to stress induced during patterning and subsequent processing. The sensors had a sensitivity of 4.92\u2009k\u2126/T and most linear in \u00b12.5 mT range.Figure 2(a) Photograph of the fabricated biochip showing the detail of each sensor and image of the chip with a reaction well attached.

                        "To detect superparamagnetic MNPs tethered to the surface of the sensor, a magnetic field is required to magnetize them31. This excitation field can be provided by either an external coil or an on-chip magnetic field generator. While external coils have several advantages, namely homogeneous fields and minimal sample heating, they suffer from a limited operating frequency range due to their large inductance, require substantially higher power, and have much larger size limiting their portability. Recent work has shown that it is able to overcome the switching speed limitation using a modified power amplifier30, but the power consumption and size are still significant. In this work, strip line inductors were fabricated below each of the sensors enabling high frequency operation (which is needed for the proposed MCDS technique) and small form factor with significantly reduced power consumption.",
                        "Several on-chip magnetic field generators have been previously reported32\u201336, but they suffered from poor field uniformity. To overcome this limitation, we propose a design where the sensors are localized within 58% of the strip line width at the center (Fig.\u00a02c). The distance between the sensors and the strip lines was engineered by trading off the effective in-plane magnetic field and dielectric strength against the dielectric breakdown37,38. The resulting field generators produce an in-plane magnetic field of up to 2.3 mT from a 50\u2009mA current, achieving 94% field uniformity across the sensor and a current-to-flux density conversion ratio of 46\u2009\u03bcT/mA. These values are confirmed from both the finite element simulation and measurement data. The magnetic field density is measured at 50\u2009nm above the GMR sensor surface. This vertical distance is chosen to represent the vertical distance of the MNPs in a practical immunoassay. It is noted that magnetic flux density decays reciprocally along the vertical direction. However the distance between the captured MNPs and the sensor surface is usually too small that such variations only cause minimal differences on the magnetic flux density. A finite element simulation showing magnetic flux density around a field wire and sensor strips is shown in Fig.\u00a0S1(a). The calculated magnetic flux density showed only 1.4% change when the vertical height increased from 0\u2009nm to 100\u2009nm (Fig.\u00a0S1(b)). To measure the resistance change due to the excitation field, the in-plane magnetic field was swept from \u221220 mT to 20 mT. The measured resistance curve shows the GMR effect saturates when the in-plane magnetic field is below \u22126 mT or above 8 mT (Fig.\u00a02d). In this work, the \u00b12.5 mT region is utilized where the curve is mostly linear."

                        "Hybridization and binding assays generally take fifteen or more minutes to reach equilibrium14,23,29. As such, this measurement is long enough for 1/f noise (from both the sensors and the readout electronics) to severely distort the measurements. This is particularly true for GMR sensors which are known to have high 1/f noise due to their multi-layer structure with multiple interface layers21,32,39,40. Correlated double sampling (CDS) is a classical circuit technique to suppress 1/f noise41,42. Briefly, two sequential measurements are made where one contains the signal of interest with noise added, and the other, only the noise. By subtracting these two measurements, the correlated noise is removed at the expense of doubling the uncorrelated (white) noise. To apply this technique to magnetic sensors, one can take a measurement with the magnetic field turned on (a sum of the signal, VMR, the non-magnetic portion of the sensor, VBASE, and the noise) and another measurement with the magnetic field off (only VBASE and the noise). Provided that the temporal difference between the two measurements (\u0394t) is sufficiently small, the 1/f noise is highly correlated and thereby eliminated by subtraction. This technique has been referred to as MCDS30.",
                        "Ideally only two samples are required; however, the data is still prone to having residual noise. To achieve the best 1/f noise suppression, conventional CDS circuits are implemented on an integrated circuit, where designers can utilize the symmetry and close proximity in layout between the signal path and the reference path to minimize process variations. However, for a prototype design presented in this work using off-the-shelf components, there are higher residual 1/f noise and offset voltages after MCDS, and the following circuits can contribute additional noise and offsets as well. To overcome this, we have extended the MCDS technique to a four-phase operation with global chopper stabilization where measurements are made with a positive magnetic field (HB\u2009>\u20090), no magnetic field (HB\u2009=\u20090), a negative magnetic field (HB\u2009<\u20090), and again with no magnetic field applied (HB\u2009=\u20090). The measured magnetoresistance components are thus \u2206MR, 0, -\u2206MR, and 0, respectively.",
                        "A prototype readout analog front-end (AFE) was designed using off-the-shelf components and assembled in house on custom printed circuit boards (PCBs). An overview of the signal path is shown in Fig.\u00a03(a) and a detailed schematic of the signal path and associated timing needed to implement the MCDS operation is shown in Fig.\u00a0S2. To measure the 1/f noise and offset-free signal, the magnetic field, HB is pulsed at 2.3 mT for 40\u2009\u00b5s. This excites the magnetoresistance of the sensor, but the bias voltage, VB is kept constant at common-mode voltage (1.65\u2009V). The MCDS operation (t1 and t2 in Fig.\u00a03b) is performed in the analog domain to subtract measurements with HB on and off, thus resulting in a measurement of the magnetoresistance, VMR:\\[V_{MR} = \\left( \\underset{{\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{i}\\mathbf{r}\\mathbf{s}\\mathbf{t}}\\,{\\mathbf{m}\\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{s}}.,\\,\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{B}} > 0}{\\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{V_{CM}}{R_{S} + \\Delta R} + \\frac{- V_{CM}}{R_{C}} \\right)}} - \\underset{\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{o}\\mathbf{n}\\mathbf{d}\\,\\mathbf{m}\\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{s}.,\\,\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathbf{B}} = 0}{\\underbrace{\\left( \\frac{V_{CM}}{R_{S}} + \\frac{- V_{CM}}{R_{C}} \\right)}} \\right)G_{PATH} \\approx - \\frac{\\Delta R}{R_{S}^{2}}G_{PATH}V_{CM}\\] where \u0394R is the change in resistance due to the applied magnetic field, VCM is the common-mode voltage, RS is the sensor resistance without an applied magnetic field (~1.8\u2009k\u2126), RC is the resistance of the bleed resistor (~1.7\u2009k\u2126), and GPATH is the transimpedance gain of the entire signal path (~112.04 dB\u2126). This expression is simplified by taking the Taylor expansion and discarding all the 2nd and higher order terms.Figure 3(a) Simplified schematic of the analog front-end.

The procedure is shown in Fig.\u00a03b and summarized in Table\u00a0S1. The noise is removed by averaging the digitized output voltage at t4 and t8. One data point requires four sets of MCDS operations, each having four phases of 40\u2009\u00b5s. The total time to record one data point is 640\u2009\u00b5s, resulting in a field frequency of 1.5625\u2009kHz.",
                        "The non-magnetoresistive component is coherently cancelled by the baseline suppression circuit to improve the dynamic range of the signal path and is not seen by the CDS circuit. Other circuit non-idealities such as residual 1/f noise and offset from the instrumentation amplifier, offset from the MCDS circuit caused by charge injection, and mismatch in the switches are suppressed by global chopper stabilization. The sample and hold and differencing operations are performed by the MCDS circuit prior to digitization, modulating the signal in the analog domain; while the demodulation from the bipolar magnetic field is done in the digital domain. The low frequency non-idealities are up-modulated to the chopping frequency and thus filtered out digitally. The penalty for the additional white noise is alleviated by low pass filtering and averaging of the incoming data. This MCDS technique with the global chopper stabilization is particularly powerful and only requires that the magnetic field driver can operate in a bipolar fashion.",
                        "Noise data are measured both with and without the proposed MCDS and chopper stabilization. Figure\u00a04 illustrates the power of this technique to suppress 1/f noise. Without these techniques, the sensor and AFE have significant energy at low frequencies that is reciprocally proportional to f\u0263 where \u0263 is 0.91 for the nominal resistance and 0.90 for the magnetoresistance (Fig.\u00a04a,b). The 1/f noise corner frequency (where the flicker noise intercepts the white noise floor), fc, are 82\u2009Hz and 88\u2009Hz for the resistive and magnetoresitive components, respectively. Using the proposed technique, both the sensor resistance (Fig.\u00a04c) and magnetoresistance (Fig.\u00a04d) see significantly lower noise contribution in this frequency range. Applying only the MCDS results in the resistive 1/f noise being entirely removed, but the magnetoresistive component still has residual 1/f noise (\u0263\u2009=\u20090.59 and fc\u2009=\u200939\u2009Hz). This residual 1/f noise comes from the gain of VMR being three decades smaller than that of VBASE. Therefore the 1/f noise of IA, S/D, and ADC are non-negligible in IMR,CDS. This residual 1/f noise is further suppressed by the global chopper stabilization as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04d.Figure 4Effect of magnetic correlated double sampling and global chopper stabilization techniques.

For example, MNPs are conveyed through cold phosphate buffer solution14 or hexane43,44. When the solution containing MNPs is applied to the sensor, it experiences a drastic temperature drop because of the temperature difference between its surface and the solution. The local heat from the on-chip field generators due to the non-zero resistance can also influence on the signal degradation of the MR sensor.

A temperature desensitized result after applying temperature correction (Eq. (8).) to VMR,measured is shown in Fig.\u00a05d in comparison with the uncorrected signal. The signal is translated to \u2206MR in ppm, the ratio of the \u2206R change to R, to normalize out sensor process variation. Compared with the raw \u2206MR before correction, the temperature corrected \u2206MR is stable regardless of temperature fluctuation induced by low temperature isopropanol. The standard deviation of corrected \u2206MR is 3.29\u2009ppm when 64 consecutively measured samples are averaged and plotted as a single data point, or 20\u2009ms per measurement. This translates to a minimum signal level of 6.58\u2009ppm (SNR\u2009>\u20096\u2009dB) or a 2.4\u2009\u03bcT field change.

The noise performance can be improved through further averaging, at the expense of longer readout time. Noise and sampling time data are plotted in Fig.\u00a0S3 to illustrate this tradeoff.

                        "Measured binding curves are shown in Fig.\u00a06e where the MNPs were added 5\u2009minutes after starting the experiment. The sensors with PEI exhibit binding curves that saturate after 27\u2009minutes whereas the three control sensors produce no signal because of the thick passivation. Sensors 1 to 4 had the highest to lowest PEI coverage, respectively (Fig.\u00a06f\u2013i). The MNP coverage percentiles were calculated by analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and are labeled on each image. The \u2206MR signals show strong linear trend with respect to the area coverage, as shown in Fig.\u00a06j. From theoretical calculations29, it can be derived that the average MR change induced by a single MNP at 2.3 mT is 3.2\u2009\u00b5\u2126/MNP. Using this relationship and the geometries of the MNP and sensor, a theoretical linear relationship between the \u2206MR signal versus area coverage is plotted along with the measured data (red dashed line in Fig.\u00a06j). The measurements show strong agreement with the calculations. The standard deviation of the control data (3.46\u2009ppm) determines the minimum detectable signal level is 6.92\u2009ppm with 6\u2009dB SNR, which is equivalent to 0.77% area coverage with 3,849 MNPs captured, or a change of 2.45\u2009\u00b5T in magnetic flux density with a dynamic range of 47.2\u2009dB.",
                        "It is worth noting that the vertical distance of an MNP-detection antibody-target analyte-capture antibody sandwich structure is longer than the MNP-PEI structure. Even though the change in magnetic flux density at these locations are negligible (Fig.\u00a0S1(b)), the magnetic interaction between the nanoparticle and the GMR free layer may cause the signal level to fluctuate. Within the range of 0 to 100\u2009nm, the net effect only causes a slight shift (6%) in the signal level45. Since the height of the captured MNP from a bioassay usually falls in this range, it is reasonable to extend the results from this section to a more generalized immunoassay application. The detection limit of MCDS approach is expected to be similar to that of our prior work29, but MCDS permits us to accommodate many more sensors on a single chip."

                "In summary, the GMR SV sensor array with on-chip field generators and the time-domain analysis method presented demonstrate great improvement in data acquisition speed, over 50\u00d7 times faster than the conventional frequency-domain method. This enables the biosensor array to be highly scalable and extremely multiplexed. As a proof-of-concept for a large-scale biosensor array, a 12-sensor GMR SV biosensor array with integrated field generators was fabricated and characterized. The system has demonstrated a minimum detectable field change of 2.45\u2009\u00b5T with a dynamic range of 42.7\u2009dB. This result elucidates the proposed method can be readily applicable to build a large-scale GMR biosensor array system."

An overview of the signal path is shown in Fig.\u00a02(a). The strip line inductors are driven using a custom designed bipolar power amplifier (Fig.\u00a0S5). The circuit consists of an amplifier (LT6202, Linear Technology) driving a PMOS transistor (IRLML2244, Infineon) connected to the strip line inductors. The strip line current is sensed using a shunt resistor and a differential amplifier (AD8211, Analog Devices), digitized (AD7942, Analog Devices), and then fed back to realize closed-loop control. The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and switching logic is implemented on an FPGA (XC3S250E, Xilinx) and a microprocessor (NUC123, Nuvoton) is used to communicate to an external PC via USB.
