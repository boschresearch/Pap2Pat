The first sample is MR signal+baseline+noise and is sampled when the modulated magnetic field is non-zero. The second sample is baseline+noise only because it is sampled when the modulated magnetic field is zero. The difference between the first and second samples will have significantly reduced low frequency noise and baseline cancellation. Modulation of the electrical bias provided to the MR sensor can be used to provide a baseline signal for temperature compensation.

The presence of an object of interest (e.g., a magnetic particle) can be sensed by the change in resistance of the MR sensor. Biological assays can be constructed by making magnetic particles bind to MR sensors under biologically specific circumstances. For example, if the MR sensors and magnetic particles are coated with an antigen and a corresponding antibody, respectively or vice versa, then binding of antibody to antigen can be detected via the MR effect.",

In such cases, system performance is often limited by electrical noise, and noise mitigation is also of more general interest for all applications of MR sensors. Accordingly, it would be an advance in the art to mitigate noise in MR sensors, especially in connection with arrays of MR sensors."

The second aspect relates to MR sensor arrays having input and output multiplexing and demultiplexing for row and column line selection, in combination with a per-sensor switch to prevent noise accumulation from idle MR sensors.",

The first sample is MR signal+baseline+noise, and the second sample is baseline+noise only. The difference between the first and second signals will have baseline cancellation and significant noise suppression because of the relatively low noise frequencies involved and because both signals are provided by the same circuitry. Further elaborations of this approach (e.g., as described below) can be used to provide low-noise temperature correction for MR sensors, and suitable architectures for low-noise MR sensor arrays.",
                        "More specifically an MR sensor array can include an analog multiplexer (Mux) and demultiplexer (deMux) to provide column line and row line selectors (or vice versa). Introduction of the Mux and the deMux dramatically reduces the number of input/output pads of the microarray chip, which in turn greatly simplifies the interface with sensor readout circuits. Adopting a two dimensional matrix structure allows sensor elements to be individually accessible in time and also improves power efficiency of the array.",

Using such switches, only sensors in selected pixels are accessible at the readout time, while the other sensors are disconnected from the row and/or column lines. This advantageously prevents noise from unselected sensors from being transmitted to the input of readout circuits. Another advantage of this methodology is to preserve the signal bandwidth of the readout channel by disconnecting unread sensors from the channel. Without it, the signal bandwidth is narrowed due to the unread sensors connected to the channel. The switches can be metal-oxide-semiconductor devices or other semiconductor devices such as switching diodes. The number of switching devices per sensor element can be one or more.",
                        "This can provide a broader scalability of magnetoresistive sensor arrays which can accommodate more than 1,000 sensors per array. In medical applications, demand for large-scale sensor arrays accommodating numerous types of analytes such as human proteins is increasing. This work provides architectures for large-scale magnetoresistive sensors array without disadvantages in channel bandwidth and noise performance. Correlated double sampling and temperature correction techniques can be used to build temperature insensitive and high throughput data acquisition systems using magnetoresistive sensors, although the techniques are suitable for arrays with less than 1000 sensors as well.",

Applications include medical, mobile and industrial applications of magnetoresistive sensors. Exemplary medical applications include diagnosis and/or prognosis of a disease and drug discovery targeting a specific disease. For mobile and industrial applications, quantification of a minute change of the magnetic field and/or magnetically actuated reaction can be provided.",

Correlated double sampling and temperature correction methods can provide ultra-high throughput in data acquisition in a large-scale sensor array with large dynamic range and high precision. For example, the readout speed per channel can be 100\u00d7 faster with the CDS approach than with prior approaches (e.g., lock-in double modulation techniques as described below).",

A modulated magnetic field of square, sinusoidal or return-to-zero waveform are suitable for CDS techniques. More generally, any modulation waveform which includes a zero magnetic field portion of the waveform can also be utilized."

                                "Molecular diagnostics is used extensively today by the medical community for disease diagnosis, prognosis, therapy monitoring and drug discovery. As researchers begin to understand the numerous biomarkers associated with complex diseases such as cancers, new sensing technologies emerge to effectively detect and measure the biomarkers of interest in patients' samples. The demand for high sensitivity, broad linear dynamic range, and large multiplexing capability requires high performance sensing technologies. Conventional optical techniques, which rely on a fluorescent tag to label biomarkers of interest, have a limited dynamic range due to the optical background noise and also inherently have relatively low sensitivity. By replacing the fluorescent tag with a magnetic nanoparticle and the bulky optics with a magnetoresistive (MR) sensor, researchers have achieved highly sensitive detection with a broad linear dynamic range.",

FIG. 1B is an image of a 64 element giant magnetoresistive (GMR) spin valve sensor array. FIG. 1C is a magnified view of a single sensor in the array of FIG. 1B. Multiple GMR sensor strips form the GMR sensor. FIG. 1D is an image showing super paramagnetic nanoparticles on the surface of the GMR sensor.",

Multiple narrow and long strips of the thin film stacks form a MR sensor (FIGS. 1B-C). It senses the minute change of the induced magnetic field by the number of magnetic nanoparticles adjacent to it in the circumstance of the external magnetic field (FIG. 1D). The number of magnetic nanoparticles is proportional to the degree of the reaction between the antibodies on the sensor surface and the analytes. If the antibodies are paired with the target analytes, the resistance of the MR sensor changes.",

FIG. 2A is a standard binding curve (Signal vs. concentration of CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen, which is a cancer biomarker)). FIG. 2B shows transient binding curves (Signal vs. time) of three biomarkers. BSA and epoxy is a biological control and a reference, respectively. A minute signal of interest is distinguishable from the control.",
                                "Since the MR sensor has both magnetic and resistive characteristics, it generates noises such as 1/f noise, thermal noise, Barkhausen noise and so on. Barkhausen noise can be eliminated by utilizing shape anisotropy of the film strips and/or applying strong magnetic field to the sensor at the preconditioning step. If Barkhausen noise is excluded, 1/f noise dominates the total noise from the sensor at the low frequency range and thermal noise at the frequency range over the corner frequency of 1/f noise. FIG. 3A shows voltage noise measured from an exemplary MR sensor at fixed current. Input voltage noise of the sensor is 4.76 nVrms/\u221aHz, which is close to the theoretical thermal noise floor 4kBTR. The 1/f noise corner frequency is at 285 Hz.",
                                "The signal of interest is commonly located at low frequency range, so 1/f noise degrades the limit of signal detection. Not only 1/f noise from the sensor, but 1/f noise caused by data acquiring electronics is also problematic. FIG. 3B shows an example of the noise profile of a commercial operational amplifier (OPA656 from Texas Instruments, Inc.), which shows the dominant 1/f noise at lower frequency range. 1/f noise is noise that has a power spectral density proportional to 1/f. The corner is where the 1/f noise intersects the thermal noise.",
                                "In order to avoid the degradation of signal-to-noise ratio by 1/f noise of the data acquisition electronics, the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) has been used to measure the change of MR ratio of the sensors for the biological reactions between analytes and antibodies. However, as the size of the sensor array increases, the non-ideal phenomena in FDM such as harmonic distortion become more prominent. Furthermore, the data acquisition time for an entire sensor array will dramatically increase so that using FDM in a large-scale sensor array is unappealing."

Here the \u2018baseline\u2019 signal is the signal that is provided by a magnetoresistive sensor in the absence of a magnetic field. Note that magnetoresistance is a change in resistance caused by an applied magnetic field. For example, the resistance may change from R to R+\u0394R due to an applied magnetic field, and in this example R is the baseline and \u0394R is the magnetoresistive effect. If a current I flows through the sensor, the baseline voltage signal is IR and the magnetoresistive voltage signal is I \u0394R. In practice, the total signal (e.g., I(R+\u0394R)) is measured and then processed to determine the magnetoresistive part of the total signal.

The basic idea is to first sample and store background noise only in the form of electronic charges by capacitors. Then signal+background is sampled and stored again right after the former capturing event. A difference circuit subtracts one from the other, and thereby only the signal of interest remains. The order of sampling events can be swapped. There are many examples of utilization of the CDS technique. A common application is the integrated image sensors widely used in cameras. Another research group has proposed the CDS technique in connection with a capacitive position sensing system.",
                                "In this work we provide a novel CDS technique to effectively suppress the background noise and offsets of the magnetoresistive sensors (FIG. 4A). It utilizes a modulated magnetic field as a signal excitation source. A modulated magnetic field of square, sinusoidal or return-to-zero waveforms are applicable to our CDS techniques (FIG. 4B). Other types of waveform which passes zero magnetic field point can also be utilized. A conventional MR sensor and the sandwich assay technique can be utilized as a sensor and its biological interface. Since MR sensors respond to the in-plane magnetic fields on their magnetic free layers, the presence of the modulated field changes the magnetoresistance of the sensors. If there is zero magnetic field, a sensor under test produces only baseline signal and noise. On the other hand, it will produce finite magnetoresistive signal as well as baseline signal and noises in the presence of non-zero magnetic field. Provided that temporal difference between two measurements ({circle around (1)} and {circle around (2)}) is sufficiently small, the 1/f noise and offset from sensors and electronics at {circle around (1)} and {circle around (2)} become highly correlated and thereby the subtraction between two measured data will remove a large portion of 1/f noise and offset. Therefore a signal having reduced 1/f noise and reduced offset can be obtained using the present CDS technique.",

Because the MR signal obtained by the present CDS technique is a complex function of TCR and TCMR and it is sensitive to the temperature change, a special temperature correction treatment is required. In this work, we show how to provide temperature correction for the CDS MR sensor technique.",

In order to increase the gain of the signal path without saturation, the baseline suppressor is introduced. The suppressor can be any circuit having the effect of reducing the baseline from the MR sensors. For example, the suppressor can be a current source, current-mode digital to analog converter, or a R\u22122R ladder to increase the tolerance against the process variation of the MR sensor. The output of the baseline suppressor subtracted from the output of MR sensor under no magnetic field is the net baseline signal comparable to the magnitude of the MR signal. The suppressed baseline and MR signal are amplified and provided to the correlated double sampler. The processed signal can be digitized and filtered in the digital domain. Finally, a novel temperature correction algorithm eliminates temperature drift noise from the measured data which can be realized in the software domain.",
                                "The baseline signal is used to extract the degree of the temperature drift at the moment, and the extracted information of temperature drift is utilized to compensate the measured MR signal to make it temperature insensitive. Because the CDS operation for obtaining MR signal (VMR) also removes the baseline signal from measured signal, a unique method to measure only the baseline signal (VBASE) is necessary. In order to improve the performance of the temperature correction, VBASE should be 1/f noise and offset-reduced. It employs an additional CDS phase during the operation.",

If CDS is not performed in the acquisition of VBASE,measured and VMR,measured, these signals will be contaminated with explicit 1/f noise (FIGS. 7A and 7C). The amplitude of the 1/f noise overwhelms the effect of temperature change on the sensors, thereby temperature correction will not properly work. Utilizing the present CDS technique in the measurement can effectively suppress 1/f noise from the measured signals (FIGS. 7B and 7D). The evaluation result of the present TC is shown in FIGS. 8A-D. When the cold hexane solution is applied to the sensor surface at six minutes, the nominal resistance (R0) and MR rapidly changes corresponding to the abrupt temperature change (FIGS. 8A and 8C). As time goes on, surface temperature starts to return to the original temperature and R0 and MR are restored to the initial values. The ratio of two temperature coefficients is constant regardless of the temperature change (FIG. 8B). With the information of temperature drift extracted from the R0 change, the measured MR can be made temperature-insensitive using the present TC technique (FIG. 8D).",

                                "To better appreciate this work, we briefly compare these results to earlier double modulation work. This earlier work utilizes double modulation and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to separate the analyte-related signals from background noise and harmonics. In spite of its high frequency resolution and superior thermal noise profile by frequency binning, FFT requires a large number of samples taken for 500 milliseconds to provide a frequency resolution of 2 Hz. It has an additional timing penalty to complete post-processing using measured samples, which is comparable to or more than sampling time, e.g., in the order of seconds. These considerations lead to a conclusion that the spectral analysis is not favorable to the large-scale magnetoresistive (MR) sensor array system regardless of in-pixel switching. In order to enhance the readout performance, we need to explore a different readout scheme other than spectral analysis.",
                                "Generally, a large-scale sensor array contains a thousand or more sensors. In order to guarantee real time analysis using a magnetoresistive biosensor array, the system needs to measure the entire array within a specified period of time. Despite the conventional spectral analysis having good SNR performance, a long readout time per column (or channel) can be a fatal disadvantage for real time analysis in bioassays. So fast readout performance is crucial to large-scale MR sensor arrays and corresponding measurement systems.",
                                "Correlated double sampling (CDS) as described above can help solve this problem. Basically this technique has been developed in order to mitigate 1/f noise, which is a significant source of noise harming the readout performance of circuits. Theoretically CDS operation just needs two subsequent data acquisitions. If the temporal difference between two acquisitions \u0394t is getting smaller, CDS can produce 1/f noise-reduced output signals at high speed. This exactly meets our needs to build a high speed data acquisition circuits for large-scale MR sensor arrays. In order to lower the thermal noise, multiple samples of CDS measurements can be taken then averaged. The above described experiments for the proof-of-concept demonstrate that the readout throughput of 48.8 samples per second per channel was achieved when the magnetic field was modulated at 3.125 kHz (2 CDS samples were taken during each period of the field modulation, so the CDS sampling rate was 6.25 KHz) and the 64 CDS output samples are averaged in experiments. These results are 24.4 times faster than the throughput of the conventional double modulation technique with assumptions that the FFT processing penalty is neglected and frequency division multiplexing is not utilized. Therefore, the readout time according to this work is shown to be faster than the conventional spectral analysis and is favorable to the large-scale MR sensor array and system."

The conventional way to increase only the number of sensors and wires to more than 256 is hardly achievable because it scales poorly. Connectivity is poor (more pads are required), noise is worse and channel bandwidth is undesirably narrowed.",

The number of rows and columns can be larger than 100 and thereby more than 10,000 MR sensors can be in the array. The number of pins (or pads) is minimized by utilizing an analog multiplexer 1006 and demultiplexer 1004. Each pixel (e.g., 1008) includes one switch S and one magnetoresistive sensor MR. However, there can be variations for the number of switches inside the pixel. An excitation source 1010 can drive either voltage or current to the sensor array, while multiplexer 1006 provides signals to readout circuitry 1012.",
                                "One of the key features of this large-scale MR sensor array is that it has a pair of analog multiplexer (Mux) and demultiplexer (deMux) as column line (heavy dashed lines e.g., 1020) and row line (heavy solid lines e.g., 1018) selectors, respectively. In the example of FIG. 10, 1014 is the row selection input to demultiplexer 1004, and 1016 is the column selection input to multiplexer 1006. Introduction of the Mux and the deMux dramatically reduces the number of input/output pads of the microarray chip, which in turn greatly simplifies the interface with sensor readout circuits. Adopting a two dimensional matrix structure makes the large-scale sensor array to be randomly accessible in time and to be power efficient. However, the fabrication of this array can be complex since both CMOS processes for analog Mux/deMux and non-CMOS post fabrication processes for MR sensors are required, which may increase the total fabrication cost. This cost issue can be resolved by adopting advanced semiconductor fabrication techniques for mass production.",
                                "The other key feature is to introduce a switch S (e.g., a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device) for each pixel as an on/off switch of a sensor. Only sensors in selected pixels are accessible at specific readout time via a turn-on MOS switch and others are disconnected to the column lines to be read by data acquisition circuits. FIG. 11 shows a sensor readout example. Here the pixel at row 1 and column 1 is measured through a turned-on switch, and the state of all switches is shown by \u2018ON\u2019 or \u2018OFF\u2019 on the figure. Noise generated from other sensors on column 1 is rejected by the turned-off switches. Thus other sensors become transparent when a sensor at row 1 and column 1 is read out by the following readout circuitry on column 1, which improves signal to noise ratio of the data acquisition system. Furthermore, disconnecting unused MR sensors from the column lines also prevents the signal bandwidth of a readout channel from being narrowed.",
                                "These benefits are demonstrated by an analog circuit simulation as shown on FIGS. 12A-D. These results are from AC simulation and noise simulation results of a transimpedance amplifier which reads an MR sensor out of at most 128 sensors per column. FIGS. 12A and 12C show magnitude and cumulative output noise, respectively, for a conventional MR sensor array (no per-pixel switches). Note that N indicates additional MR sensors attached to the same channel. As N increases, the channel bandwidth gets narrower and the output noise profile gets worse. Both bandwidth and output noise of the amplifier are heavily dependent on the number of sensors per column.",
