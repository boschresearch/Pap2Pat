                        "The sun is a vast source of clean, renewable energy, which when harnessed, may reduce humanity's reliance on non-renewable and polluting fossil fuels (e.g., crude oil, coal, or natural gas). Solar energy is capable of being transformed into several useful forms including electricity, various chemical fuels, and heat. In particular, heat generated from solar energy has been shown to have several uses including, but not limited to, driving various industrial processes (e.g., cooking, washing, drying), heating residential or commercial spaces, and replacing fossil fuels as a heat source in conventional power plants. In yet another application, sunlight may be absorbed to produce heat that is then used to vaporize (i.e., evaporate and/or boil) a liquid. The resulting vapor (i.e., the gas phase of the liquid) may then be used in various applications including desalination (e.g., water purification), sterilization, or power generation (e.g., in a Rankine cycle). In the foregoing manners, heat derived from solar energy may reduce, or in some instances, replace conventional fossil-fuel based boilers."

                        "The present disclosure is directed to various implementations of a solar vapor generator for the generation and/or superheating of vapor from a liquid, respective components of the solar vapor generator, and methods relating to the same. In one example, the solar vapor generator includes an absorber in thermal communication with an emitter. The absorber absorbs incident sunlight, thus producing heat that is then transferred to the emitter via thermal conduction. The emitter then emits the heat as thermal radiation to radiatively heat and vaporize a liquid, thus producing vapor. In one aspect, since heat is transferred to the liquid via electromagnetic radiation (photons), the emitter may be physically separated from the liquid during operation, thereby substantially reducing fouling of the absorber and/or the emitter.",
                        "Furthermore, the absorber/emitter may be used to superheat the vapor. Thus, in some implementations the temperature of the vapor may be increased above the boiling point of the liquid at ambient pressure and/or without solar concentration. The superheated vapor generated by the concepts disclosed herein may be used in various applications including, but not limited to, sterilization (e.g., a solar vapor generator coupled to an autoclave to enable sterilization of medical equipment in remote locations with little access to electricity), cooking, laundering, absorption/adsorption cooling, and process heating, desalination, and waste water treatment. This process can also be used to heat liquids other than water. It should be appreciated that while the solar vapor generator may generate and superheat vapor at ambient pressure and/or without solar concentration, in some implementations, the solar vapor generator may be designed to be pressurized and/or include a solar concentrator.",
                        "In one exemplary implementation, a solar vapor generator includes an absorber to absorb sunlight, such that the sunlight is converted into heat. The solar vapor generator also includes a housing, where a first side of the absorber is disposed on the housing. The housing is used to transfer heat from the absorber to the emitter. The solar vapor generator also includes an emitter, disposed on a first side of the housing, to receive the heat from the housing and to emit at least a portion of the heat as thermal radiation. The solar vapor generator also includes a basin, mechanically coupled to the housing, to position the emitter such that the emitter is physically separated from a liquid. When the liquid is present, the liquid absorbs at least some of the thermal radiation close to the surface region of the liquid, and is thus vaporized, resulting in the generation of vapor.",
                        "The housing of the solar vapor generator may further include an interior cavity with an opening to admit the generated vapor into the interior cavity of the housing such that the vapor, when present, receives a portion of the heat from the housing as the vapor flows through the interior cavity. The housing may also include an outlet for the vapor to flow out of the solar vapor generator for subsequent consumption and/or use. In some implementations, the interior cavity of the housing may be filled, at least in part, by at least one of a porous material or a finned channel. The housing may further be formed from at least one of aluminum, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, polypropylene, or polyethylene. A radiation shield may also be disposed between the emitter and the liquid to control the temperature of the vapor by reflecting a first portion of the thermal radiation back to the emitter. The radiation shield may include an aperture to transmit a second portion of the thermal radiation towards the liquid.",
                        "The solar vapor generator may further include the liquid, which may be at least one of water, glycol, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, or perfluorocarbons. In some implementations, the basin may be comprised of a plurality of sidewalls that form a cavity with a first end and second end, to contain the liquid when present. The first end of the housing may be substantially open and mechanically coupled to the first side of the emitter, wherein the second end may be substantially closed. In some implementations, a first portion of the liquid may be proximate to the emitter and include a surface of the liquid that substantially absorbs the thermal radiation. In this case, the basin may be comprised of a plurality of sidewalls that form a cavity with a first end and a second end, the first end being substantially open and mechanically coupled to the first side of the emitter and the second end being substantially open and submerged in the liquid. A thermally insulating layer may be disposed within the cavity defined by the plurality of sidewalls and submerged in the liquid to substantially reduce the transport of heat from the first portion of the liquid to the remaining liquid. The thermally insulating layer may include one or more perforations to allow the liquid to flow through the thermally insulating layer. In some implementations, the thermally insulating layer may also provide sufficient buoyancy such that the absorber, the housing, and the emitter can float on the liquid. The solar vapor generator may also include at least one of a buoy or a weight, mechanically coupled to at least one of the housing or the basin, to adjust the position of the thermally insulating layer within the liquid.",
                        "In another exemplary implementation, a solar vapor generator includes an absorber to absorb sunlight, where the sunlight is converted into heat by the absorber. The solar vapor generator may also include a housing disposed on a first side of the absorber to transport the heat from the absorber to an emitter disposed on a first side of the housing. The emitter may receive at least a portion of the heat and emit the portion of the heat as thermal radiation. The solar vapor generator may also include a basin disposed on a first side of the emitter and coupled to the housing, to contain a liquid that, when present, is physically separated from the emitter to absorb at least some of the thermal radiation and thereby undergo vaporization to generate a vapor. The housing may include at least one opening to allow the vapor to flow through the at least one opening into an interior cavity of the housing. The vapor may then receive a portion of the heat from the housing as it flows along a path through the interior cavity where the housing includes an outlet for the vapor to flow out of the solar vapor generator.",
                        "In some implementations, the emitter may emit the thermal radiation at one or more wavelengths corresponding to one or more absorption bands of the liquid, wherein each one of the absorption bands has a penetration depth up to 100 \u03bcm in the liquid, when present. The solar vapor generator may also include a thermally insulating cover, disposed on a second side of the absorber, to thermally insulate the absorber from a surrounding environment. The thermally insulating cover may include a first portion that is substantially transparent to the sunlight where the first portion is aligned to the absorber. In some implementations, the thermally insulating cover is at least one of a polymer glazing with one or more layers, or an aerogel, or an evacuated space. The solar vapor generator may also include a thermally insulating enclosure, substantially surrounding the absorber, the housing, the emitter, and the basin, to substantially inhibit the transfer of heat from the solar vapor generator to a surrounding environment. In some implementations, the solar vapor generator may also include a solar concentrator, in optical communication with the absorber, to increase the intensity of the sunlight from about 1 sun to about 20 suns.",
                        "In yet another exemplary implementation, a method of generating vapor may be comprised of the following steps: (1) absorbing at least a portion of sunlight incident on an absorber, (2) converting, by the absorber, at least a portion of the absorbed sunlight to heat, (3) transferring the heat from the absorber to an emitter, (4) emitting a first portion of the heat as thermal radiation from the emitter to a first liquid disposed proximate to the emitter so as to cause the first liquid to vaporize and produce a vapor, wherein the emitter is physically separated from the first liquid, and (5) heating the vapor using a second portion of the heat from the absorber. The method may also be preceded by the step of varying an intensity of the sunlight from about 0.5 suns to about 20 suns. The method may also include the steps of storing a third portion of the heat from the absorber in a thermal storage media and controllably generating or controllably heating the vapor based at least in part on the stored portion of the heat in the thermal storage media. In some implementations, the method may be followed by the steps of removing heat from the vapor so as to condense the vapor into a second liquid and transporting at least a portion of the heat removed from the vapor back to the emitter to evaporate the first liquid.",

It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in numerous ways. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes so as to enable those skilled in the art to practice the implementations and alternatives apparent to those skilled in the art.",
                        "The figures and example implementations described below are not meant to limit the scope of the present implementations to a single embodiment. Other implementations are possible by way of interchange of some or all of the described or illustrated elements. Moreover, where certain elements of the disclosed example implementations may be partially or fully implemented using known components, in some instances only those portions of such known components that are necessary for an understanding of the present implementations are described, and detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components are omitted so as not to obscure the present implementations.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows an illustration of a solar vapor generator 100 as taught by Ni et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2018, 11, 1510-1519, Ni et al., Nature Energy, 1, 16126, 2016, Ni et at, Nano Energy, 17, 290, 2015, and Ghasemi et al., Nature Communications, 5, 4449, 2014 The solar vapor generator 100 typically includes an absorber 120 to absorb and convert incident sunlight into heat. Various types of monolithic structures and particle suspensions have been used as an absorber in a solar vapor generator including, but not limited to, black paints and fabrics (e.g., as used in conventional solar stills), nanoparticle suspensions, high-porosity membranes, and nano-patterned materials. However, despite the various types of absorbers that have been previously used, the heat generated by the absorber is typically transferred to a liquid via thermal conduction. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the absorber 120 may be placed into physical contact with a liquid 140 so as to directly transfer heat from the absorber 120 to the liquid 140. In other instances, an insulating layer may be placed between the absorber and the liquid where the liquid is fed into a portion of the absorber via wicking and/or gravity.",
                        "The Inventors, however, have recognized and appreciated that the source of liquid used in previous solar vapor generators often contains unwanted materials. For example, the liquid may be seawater, which is an abundant source of potentially potable water. When vaporized, seawater typically leaves behind concentrated salts and other impurities that are prone to contaminating and/or clogging the absorber, an issue that is often conventionally referred to as fouling. Over time, fouling may reduce or even inhibit the generation of steam from a conventional solar vapor generator. Previous approaches towards reducing the severity of fouling have included daily cleaning and rinsing, material recycling, and developing anti-fouling and/or salt-rejecting materials, and structures (e.g., Ni et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2018, 11, 1510-1519). These approaches also typically increase labor and material costs associated with operating a conventional solar vapor generator. The flow of water through previous solar vapor generators is also typically achieved via pumping, which consumes electricity, or via gravity, which requires elevation of parts of, or the entire system.",
                        "Additionally, in the conventional solar vapor generator 100 described above, the temperature of the vapor 160 produced by the solar vapor generator 100 is typically limited to the boiling point of the liquid 140 (also referred to herein as the saturation temperature). For example, the boiling point of water is 100\u00b0 C. at atmospheric pressure. When additional heat is generated by the absorber 120, the additional heat is typically transferred to the liquid 140, causing the liquid 140 to vaporize and produce more vapor 160, rather than raising the temperature of the vapor 160. Thus, the temperature of the vapor 160 remains limited to the boiling point of the liquid 140.",
                        "Furthermore, in some instances, conventional solar vapor generators may operate below the boiling point of the liquid 140, thus evaporation of the liquid 140 is typically governed by mass transfer resulting from a liquid-vapor concentration gradient. The reliance on mass transfer leads to a trade-off between heat and mass transport. For instance, covering the device to reduce convection losses can actually reduce system efficiency due to a concomitant reduction in mass transport.",
                        "Another challenge associated with past solar vapor generators is the condensation of vapor. Typically, a plastic cover, disposed above the absorber is used for condensation. Liquid droplets formed on the plastic cover reduces solar irradiation onto the absorber and reduces the system efficiency, from a high open evaporation efficiency over 80% down to \u02dc30% or below. Furthermore, the condensed liquid might need to be pumped for subsequent use. Pumping typically requires electricity, which may not be readily available for certain applications and/or may complicate the system design.",
                        "In many applications, superheated vapor (e.g., vapor at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature for a given pressure) may increase the efficiency and/or power output of a system (e.g., a Rankine cycle) and/or is necessary to meet specific requirements. For example, in sterilization, health safety standards for medical and food safety sterilization require steam to be at a temperature of 121-135\u00b0 C. to kill pathogenic microorganisms and their spores. Industrial processes often need steams with temperature higher than 100\u00b0 C. However, conventional approaches to surpass 100\u00b0 C. vapor have been based on either pressurizing the liquid to increase the boiling point and/or concentrating sunlight (e.g., in excess of 20 suns, where 1 sun is equal to 1000 Wm\u22122) to heat a floating membrane, which vaporizes liquid and transfers a portion of the heat to the vapor. Both approaches typically increase system complexity, resulting in greater costs.",
                        "The present disclosure is thus directed to an inventive solar vapor generator that includes an emitter in thermal communication with an absorber to radiatively heat and vaporize a liquid and produce a vapor. In contrast to conventional solar vapor generators, transferring heat via thermal radiation does not require physical contact between two media. An exemplary solar vapor generator 1000 is illustrated in FIG. 2 to provide an overview of the concept. As illustrated in FIG. 2 and discussed in greater detail below, an emitter 1300 of a solar vapor generator 1000 is substantially physically decoupled from a liquid 1400, which can substantially reduce fouling of an absorber 1100 and/or the emitter 1300. Furthermore, the vapor 1500 may flow through at least a portion of the absorber 1100 so as to receive additional heat from the absorber 1100 and the emitter 1300, thus superheating the vapor 1500. In this manner, the temperature of the vapor 1500 can increase above the boiling point of the liquid 1400 without pressurization and/or solar concentration."

The spectral absorption coefficient \u03ba\u03bb quantifies the strength of absorption in the liquid 1400 and its reciprocal, 1/\u03ba\u03bb, may be interpreted as the penetration depth of a photon of wavelength \u03bb. Based on Eq. (1), the penetration depth is defined as the distance at which the intensity of incident light decreases to about 1/e of its original value at the surface of a material.",
                                "As an illustrative example, the liquid 1400 may be water according to some implementations of the disclosure. FIG. 3A details the penetration depth of water (bottom panel) as a function wavelength spanning optical and far infrared (IR) regimes. The penetration depth is compared to the spectral radiative flux of the sun as well as blackbody sources at temperatures of 100\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. As shown in FIG. 3A, water is a poor absorber of photons at wavelengths corresponding to the solar spectrum. For instance, the peak spectral radiative flux of the solar spectrum corresponds to a penetration depth in water of about 40 m, which is an impractically large volume of liquid to absorb thermal radiation for the purposes of heating up the liquid to accelerate evaporation. FIG. 3B shows a spectrally averaged penetration depth of water, defined as the penetration depth to absorb 90% of the thermal radiation emitted by a blackbody at varying temperatures. As shown in FIG. 3B, in the case of the sun, which is approximated as blackbody source at 6000 K, the spectrally averaged penetration depth is about 20 m.",

As shown in FIG. 3A, the spectral radiative flux for the blackbody sources at 100\u00b0 C. and 200\u00b0 C. span a wavelength range of about 2.5 \u03bcm to about 25 \u03bcm that substantially overlaps with the vibrational absorption bands of the H2O molecule. At these wavelengths, the penetration depths range from about 1 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm, which is several orders of magnitude smaller compared to solar wavelengths. As shown in FIG. 3A, the spectrally averaged penetration depth for a blackbody source at 500\u00b0 C. or less is about 100 \u03bcm or less, which again is several orders of magnitude smaller than the 20 m for solar radiation.",
                                "To reconcile the different absorptive properties of water at solar and IR wavelengths, the absorber 1100 may be configured to absorb incident sunlight and the emitter 1300 may be configured to emit IR thermal radiation. The combination of the absorber 1100 and the emitter 1300 functions as a thermal downconverter to convert sunlight at short wavelengths to thermal radiation at long wavelengths. Since the spectrally averaged penetration depth of water is typically less than about 100 \u03bcm, water may readily function as its own absorber. In this manner, the absorber 1100 and the emitter 1300 may be physically separated from the liquid 1400 during operation, thereby substantially reducing fouling of the absorber 1100 and/or the emitter 1300 due to contaminants in the liquid 1400. This approach may be generally applied to other types of liquid 1400 that absorbs IR thermal radiation.",
                                "Additionally, while the solar vapor generator 1000 operates at the boiling point of the liquid 1400, the evaporation mechanism is fundamentally different from conventional pool boiling. In pool boiling, the heat source is at a solid-water interface and excess heat (e.g., superheating from the walls) is necessary to nucleate a bubble, which then rises to the cooler liquid-vapor interface. In the case of the solar vapor generator 1000 described herein, the effective heat source may be localized to within the penetration depth of the liquid 1400 (e.g., about 100 \u03bcm or less for water) from the liquid-vapor interface, such that vapor generation occurs by interfacial evaporation and bubble formation is not necessarily required."

Heat from the absorber 1100 and the emitter 1300 may be used to superheat the vapor 1500, such that the vapor 1500 exhibits a temperature higher than the boiling point of the liquid 1400. A 1D analysis of the solar vapor generator 1000 in FIG. 2 may be used to conceptually demonstrate, at least to first order, superheating of the vapor. Again, the liquid 1400 may be assumed to be water in this exemplary analysis. A steady-state energy balance on the absorber 1100/emitter 1300 may define the net heat flux transferred to the liquid 1400 as {dot over (q)}gain=\u03b7opt\u00b7{dot over (q)}solar\u2212{dot over (q)}loss, where \u03b7opt is the optical efficiency (discussed in detail further below), {dot over (q)}solar is the incident solar flux, and {dot over (q)}loss represents all forms of heat loss to the environment. An overall heat transfer coefficient may be defined for the gain and loss terms as: Ugain\u2261{dot over (q)}gain/(Te\u2212Tw) and Uloss\u2261{dot over (q)}loss/(Te\u2212T\u221e), where Te is the temperature of the absorber 1100 and the emitter 1300 (assumed to be equal), Tw is the water temperature, and T\u221e is the temperature of the ambient environment. Using the heat transfer coefficients Ugain and Uloss, Te may be solved as follows,",

However, a simple analytical model may be obtained by assuming that Ugain and Uloss are remain substantially constant over a particular temperature range, which renders Eq. (2) explicit. Uloss may include radiation, conduction and convection heat transfer from the system to environment. For example, the loss may be taken as Uloss=4.6 W m\u22122K\u22121, which is comparable to a laboratory-scale solar vapor generator described below. Ugain encompasses all modes of heat transfer from the emitter 1300 to the liquid 1400, which is dominated by radiation heat transfer. Assuming a simplified case of radiative heat exchange between two blackbodies for a planar emitter 1300 and liquid 1400, Ugain is the radiation heat transfer coefficient \u03c3(Tw2+Te2)(Tw+Te), which may be approximately 13 W m\u22122K\u22121 for Tw=373 K and Te=398 K. Based on these values for Ugain and Uloss, the temperature Te may then be determined. Under the conditions where {dot over (q)}solar=1000 W m\u22122 (equivalent to 1 sun), \u03b7opt=0.76 (a representative value based on the laboratory-scale prototype described below), and T\u221e=25\u00b0 C., Eq. (2) gives an equilibrium absorber 1100/emitter 1300 temperature of Te=124\u00b0 C.",

(i.e., the boiling point of water). As shown in FIG. 2, the vapor 1500 may pass through a portion of the emitter 1300 and/or the absorber 1100, which transfers heat to the vapor 1500 via solid-vapor heat transfer, thereby superheating the vapor 1500. The vapor 1500 may reach a temperature up to Te. For this exemplary analysis, the sensible heat of the vapor 1500 is assumed to be negligible in the energy balance on the absorber 1100/emitter 1300 used to determine Te, as the sensible heat is substantially smaller than {dot over (q)}solar, {dot over (q)}gain and {dot over (q)}loss when the vapor temperatures are less than 160\u00b0 C. However, in instances where the vapor temperatures may be sufficiently high, the sensible heat of the vapor 1500 may be included in the analysis. As will be described further below, this analysis in conjunction with more detailed transient heat transfer models, which also captures nonlinear effects and secondary effects such as the sensible heat associated with superheating, may be used to assess the operation of a solar vapor generator disclosed herein."

                                "An exemplary design for a solar vapor generator 2000 is shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. The solar vapor generator 2000 includes an absorber 2100 to absorb incident sunlight, thereby producing heat. The absorber 2100 may be disposed onto at least a portion of a housing 2200, which mechanically supports the absorber 2100 and functions to transfer heat from the absorber 2100 to an emitter 2300 (e.g., through the walls of the housing 2200 or through the air/vapor 2500 contained within the housing 2200). The emitter 2300 may be disposed onto at least a portion of the housing 2200 to receive heat from the housing 2200 and emit the heat as thermal radiation. A liquid 2400 may be disposed proximate the emitter 2300 so as to receive and absorb the thermal radiation, resulting in heating of the liquid 2400. In some implementations, the liquid 2400 may be stored in a basin 2420, which is mechanically coupled to the housing 2200, to allow the solar vapor generator 2000 to be readily portable and deployable on land. Once the liquid 2400 is heated to its boiling point, the liquid 2400 undergoes a phase change to produce a vapor 2500. The vapor 2500 may be flowed through an interior cavity 2210 of the housing 2200 to receive additional heating from the absorber 2100 and/or the emitter 2300 via the housing 2200, thus superheating the vapor 2500 to temperatures higher than the saturation temperature. The vapor 2500 may then flow out of the solar vapor generator 2000 via an outlet 2260 disposed on at least one side of the housing 2200.",

The absorber 2100 may be shaped to substantially conform to at least one side of the housing 2200 so as to increase thermal conduction from the absorber 2100 to the housing 2200. For example, the absorber 2100 may be substantially flat and disposed on to a corresponding flat side of the housing 2200. In another example, the housing 2200 may have at least one side with a convex or a concave curvature. The absorber 2100 may be shaped so as to conform to the convex or concave shape of the at least one side of the housing 2200. The absorber 2100 may be dimensioned to be substantially similar in size to the at least one side of the housing 2200.",

If heat losses from the absorber 2100 are sufficiently reduced (e.g., by incorporating thermally insulating media as discussed in more detail below), the absorber 2100 may be dimensioned to be larger than the at least one side of the housing 2200. The larger absorber 2100 can absorb more sunlight, thus increasing the total heat input into the solar vapor generator 2000. The substrate of the absorber 2100 may then conduct heat to the side of the housing 2200 having smaller dimensions, effectively concentrating the heat absorbed by the absorber 2100 to a smaller area. In some implementations, the substrate may form at least a portion of the side of the housing 2200.",
                                "The absorber 2100 may be a continuous structure with an absorptive surface that substantially spans the entirety of the absorber 2100. In some implementations, the absorber 2100 may be comprised of a plurality of absorbing elements arranged so as to form an absorptive surface. The plurality of absorbing elements may enable the absorber 2100 to more readily conform to non-planar surfaces without imposing undesirable mechanical stress and/or strain on the absorbing surface. For example, the absorbing elements may be comprised of hard, brittle materials that may fracture if placed onto a non-planar surface and/or have poor thermal contact to the housing 2200. By placing smaller absorbing elements onto a non-planar surface, the mechanical bending forces imposed on each of the absorbing elements may be substantially reduced and the thermal contact substantially increased.",
                                "In some implementations, the absorber 2100 may be configured to substantially absorb incident light corresponding to solar wavelengths. At the solar wavelengths, the absorber 2100 may be polarization insensitive. The absorber 2100 may also be configured to be absorptive over a broad range of incident angles such that the absorber 2100 may remain in a static position while providing sufficient heat input to generate vapor as the sun traverses the sky during the day. In some implementations, a solar tracking system may be coupled to the solar vapor generator 2000, which adjusts the orientation of the absorber 2100 such that incident sunlight is at about normal incidence with respect to the absorber 2100 as the position of the sun changes during the day.",
                                "In order to reduce radiative losses to the ambient environment, the absorber 2100 may be further configured to be non-emissive at IR wavelengths. For example, the absorber 2100 may be a selective surface. In a preferred implementation, the absorber 2100 may exhibit a cut-off wavelength, where shorter wavelengths exhibit an absorptance greater than about 0.9 and longer wavelengths exhibit an emittance less than about 0.1. FIG. 5A shows an exemplary spectral emittance of a selective surface, showing the emittance is greater than about 0.9 at wavelengths ranging between 300 nm to 1050 nm and less than 0.1 at wavelengths between about 5 \u03bcm and 20 \u03bcm. FIG. 5B shows the total emittance, integrated over wavelength and angle, of the selective surface of FIG. 5A as a function of the emitter temperature. As shown, the total emittance of the selective surface remains below 0.1 for temperatures below about 250\u00b0 C. The total emittance also increases as the emitter temperature increases due to the radiative flux of the selective surface shifting to shorter wavelengths, corresponding to a higher spectral emittance. It should be appreciated that the properties of the selective surface in FIGS. 5A and 5B are exemplary, and may vary based on the design of the selective surface.",
                                "The cut-off wavelength of the absorber 2100 may be tuned based on the solar spectrum and the desired operating temperature of the solar vapor generator 2000. For example, the cut-off wavelength may be tuned to correspond to an edge of an atmospheric absorption band (e.g., H2O or CO2) to increase solar absorption while reducing thermal radiation losses. In another example, a higher emitter temperature may be desired. The higher temperature, however, shifts thermal radiation losses from the absorber 2100 to shorter wavelengths (i.e., a higher temperature blackbody). The cut-off wavelength may thus be tuned to shorter wavelengths to reduce the thermal radiation losses from the absorber 2100 to the ambient environment.",

The absorber 2100 may be coupled to the substrate and/or to the housing 2200 using various coupling mechanisms including, but not limited to screw fasteners, bolt fasteners, clips, clamps, brazing, welding, and adhesives (e.g., silicone adhesive). In some implementations, particularly where the absorber substrate of the absorber 2100 is mechanically coupled to a surface of the housing 2200 (e.g., enclosed surface on second end of housing 2200), a thermal interface material may be disposed between the absorber 2100 and the housing 2200 to reduce the thermal interface resistance, thus increasing heat conduction to the housing 2200. The coupling mechanism may also impart a clamping force to press the absorber 2100 onto the housing 2200, further reducing the thermal interface resistance. In some implementations, the absorber 2100 may include a gasket 2120 disposed between the absorber 2100 and the housing 2200 to form a substantially airtight seal between the interior cavity 2210 of the housing 2200 and the ambient environment. The substrate of the absorber 2100 may include a plurality of grooves and/or trenches to facilitate alignment with the gasket 2120 during assembly.",

The absorber substrate may be formed from various metals including, but not limited to, aluminum, copper, carbon steel, and stainless steel. In some implementations, the absorber substrate of the absorber 2100 may be formed from polymers including, but not limited to, polyethylene and polypropylene. In instances where the absorber substrate is a polymer, the absorber substrate may be dimensioned to have a lower thermal resistance (e.g., by reducing the thickness of the absorber substrate). In some implementations, the solar vapor generator 2000 may generate sufficient vapor 2500, which may also be used to transfer heat from the absorber 2100 to the emitter 2300.",

As describe above, the housing 2200 may be a hollow enclosure comprising a plurality of sidewalls coupled together, defining the interior cavity 2210 of the housing 2200. The plurality of sidewalls may further define a first end and a second end, where the first end is substantially enclosed. In some implementations, the second end may also be substantially enclosed prior to assembly with the absorber 2100. As described above, in some implementations, the substrate of the absorber 2100 may couple to the second end of the plurality of sidewalls of the housing 2200 to enclose the interior cavity 2210.",

For example, the absorber 2100 and the emitter 2300 may be disposed on opposing sides of the housing 2200 where the height of the housing 2200 is reduced in order to reduce the thermal resistance between the absorber 2100 and the emitter 2300. This geometry also reduces the portion of the housing 2200 exposed to the ambient environment (e.g., the sides of the housing 2200 that are not coincident with the absorber 2100 and the emitter 2300), thus reducing parasitic heat losses to the ambient environment.",

For example, the vapor holes 2220 may be disposed along the periphery of the portion of the housing 2200 where the emitter 2300 is located, as shown in FIG. 4B. The housing 2200 may also include an opening for the outlet 2260 (as will be described in more detail below). As the vapor 2500 flows through the interior cavity 2210, heat may be transferred from the housing 2200 to the vapor 2500 via thermal conduction and/or convection. The amount of heat received by the vapor 2500 will depend, in part, on the length of the flow path 2240 through the interior cavity 2210. FIG. 4A shows an exemplary flow path 2240 that the vapor 2500 may follow as it flows through the interior cavity 2210 of the housing 2200.",
                                "Generally, a longer flow path 2240 corresponds to greater superheating of the vapor 2500 by increasing the residence time for heat to transfer from the housing 2200 to the vapor 2500. In some implementations, the flow path 2240 may be increased by filling at least a portion of the interior cavity 2210 with a porous medium 2230, which creates a long, tortuous path for the vapor 2500 to flow through. The porous medium 2230 may be heated by the housing 2200 via thermal conduction and/or convection such that during operation, the porous medium 2230 is at a temperature higher than the saturation temperature of the vapor 2500. In this manner, the vapor 2500 may be superheated as the vapor 2500 flows through the porous medium 2230. The porous medium 2230 may be various types of foam having a high specific surface area to increase convective heat transfer including, but not limited to reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam (e.g., ERG Duocell\u00ae 100 PPI), graphitic foam, and metallic foam. In some implementations, the porous medium 2230 may be disposed in the interior cavity of the housing 2200 with the edges simply in physical contact with the housing. The porous medium 2230 may be dimensioned to be larger than the dimensions of the interior cavity 2210 such that the porous medium 2230 is compressed when placed into the interior cavity 2210. The compressive force that arises due to the compression of the porous medium 2230 may increase the thermal contact between the porous medium 2230 and the housing 2200. In some implementations, the thermal contact between the porous medium 2230 and the housing 2200 may be improved by bonding or soldering the porous medium 2230 to the housing 2200. In this manner, more heat may be transferred to the porous medium 2230, thus increasing superheating of the vapor 2500.",

The fins may be oriented such that the flow of vapor 2500 is not substantially impeded by the fins. The fins may be various types of shapes including, but not limited to, a rectangle, a cylinder, a tapered pin, and a tapered rectangular fin.",

Nearly all the thermal radiation may be absorbed within a few integer multiples of the penetration depth (e.g., from about 3 \u03bcm to about 300 \u03bcm). As a result, the thermal radiation and the resultant heating of the liquid 2400 is initially confined near the surface of the liquid 2400.

Therefore, unlike conventional solar vapor generator systems, solar concentration is not necessary for operation of the solar vapor generator 2000, which simplifies and reduces the cost of the solar vapor generator 2000. However, in some applications, higher temperature vapor 2500 and/or higher flow rates of vapor 2500 may be desirable to warrant use of a solar concentrator. For example, the solar vapor generator 2000 may be used in a power cycle where the costs of a solar concentrator are small compared to the potential improvements to the efficiency and/or power output of the power cycle that greater superheating engenders. In another example, a solar concentrator may be used in locations where direct sunlight is less available (e.g., at higher latitudes).",

The solar concentrator may provide solar concentrations ranging from about 1 sun to about 20 suns. A higher solar concentration corresponds to a higher heat input into the solar vapor generator 2000, which allows for superheated vapor 2500 at higher temperatures and a higher vapor generation rate. In some implementations, the solar concentrator may be a stationary non-tracking optical concentrator."

If the solar vapor generator 2000 is substantially sealed, the generation of vapor 2500 may increase the internal pressure of the solar vapor generator 2000, causing the boiling point of the liquid 2400 to increase. Thus, as more heat is added and more vapor 2500 is produced, the temperature and the pressure of the liquid 2400 would continually increase. Once the solar vapor generator 2000 is opened to the ambient environment (e.g., through use of a valve), the pressure difference between the interior of the solar vapor generator 2000 and the ambient environment may cause the vapor 2500 to flow out of the solar vapor generator 2000. Instead, if the solar vapor generator 2000 is substantially open, such that there is no flow restriction, any additional heat added to the liquid 2400 will mostly cause evaporation (i.e., the pressure rise in the solar vapor generator 2000 may be negligibly small).",

In some implementations, the solar vapor generator 2000 may be configured to have a sufficiently low flow resistance such that the vapor pressure generated by vaporizing the liquid 2400 and producing vapor 2500 drives a flow of vapor 2500 through the interior cavity 2210 of the housing 2200 and the outlet 2260.",

For example, the solar vapor generator 2000 may be scaled to a larger size, resulting in a substantially longer flow path 2240, which might result in greater superheating, but a higher flow resistance. In such instances, a pump may be coupled to the solar vapor generator 2000 to help drive the vapor 2500 along the longer flow path 2240. For example, the housing 2200 may include one or more pairs of inlets and outlets to allow a pump to be coupled along a portion of the flow path 2240.",

For example, the absorber 2100 may generate excess heat (e.g., more heat is generated than is necessary to superheat the vapor 2500 to a desired temperature), which may then be controllably released such that the production of superheated vapor 2500 is less sensitive to fluctuations in incident sunlight (e.g., day and night cycles). The thermal storage system may be passively controlled such that the amount of heat transferred from the thermal storage system to the solar vapor generator 2000 is based, in part, on the temperature difference between the thermal storage medium and at least one component of the solar vapor generator 2000 (e.g., the housing 2200, the liquid 2400, the emitter 2300). The thermal storage system may also be actively controlled where a controlling mechanism (e.g., a valve, a switch) may be used to not only maintain a desired output (e.g., a desired vapor generation rate, a desired vapor 2500 temperature), but to also allow changes to the desired output during operation.",

For example, the thermal storage medium may be a phase change material having a phase transition temperature higher than the boiling point of the liquid 2400 such that the emitter 2300 may be maintained at a temperature sufficient to evaporate the liquid 2400 while allowing at least a portion of heat to be stored as latent heat. In another example, the thermal storage medium may be a material having a high heat capacity, but does not change phases within the operating temperature range of the liquid 2400. The thermal storage medium may be various materials including, but not limited to paraffin wax, water, molten salts, concrete, glycol, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, and perfluorocarbons. In some instances, the thermal storage medium may be the same liquid 2400 used for vapor generation, but substantially sealed such that the boiling point is higher than the liquid 2400 that produces vapor 2500.",

For example, the thermal storage system may be comprised of a thermal storage medium, as described above, with a pumping system that flows a working fluid to transfer heat from the thermal storage system to the solar vapor generator 2000 through, for instance, one or more inlets/outlets disposed on the housing 2200. The interior cavity 2210 may include a separate set of channels for the working fluid to transfer heat to the housing 2200 and the vapor 2500 without directly contacting the vapor 2500.",

For example, in desalination applications, the solar vapor generator 2000 may vaporize seawater and the resultant steam may then be condensed into potable water. As the vapor 2500 cools down and condenses into a liquid, heat is released, which is typically lost to the ambient environment. The function of the heat recovering system is to thus utilize at least a portion of the heat for use in various processes. In some implementations, the heat recovering system may utilize heat from the solar vapor generator 2000 for various industrial processes (e.g., cooking, washing, drying), heating residential or commercial spaces, and replacing fossil fuels as a heat source in conventional power plants. In some instances, the heat recovering system may transfer heat back to the solar vapor generator 2000 to evaporate additional liquid 2400. The heat recovering system may be coupled to the outlet 2260 or to a piping system coupled to the outlet 2260 to extract heat from the vapor 2500. The heat recovering system may receive heat via a heat exchanging system, such as a parallel-flow or a counter-flow heat exchanger where a working fluid receives heat from the vapor 2500."

                                "The solar vapor generator 2000 may be designed to operate at a pressure higher than ambient pressure. In some implementations, the solar vapor generator 2000 may be pressurized by restricting the flow of vapor 2500 either by introducing a restriction internally within the solar vapor generator 2000 along the flow path 2240 or by introducing a restriction downstream after vapor 2500 flows out of the solar vapor generator 2000 through the outlet 2420. For example, a valve may be disposed down stream from the solar vapor generator 2000. Once a restriction is introduced, the solar vapor generator 200 will naturally self-pressurize during operation (e.g., when the liquid 2400 is heated). For example, the pressure in the basin 2420 may be from about 1.1 atm to about 3.0 atm. The higher pressure may increase the boiling point of the liquid 2400, which typically increases the saturation temperature at which the vapor 2500 is generated. Additionally, the higher pressure may also provide a driving force to flow the vapor 2500 through the solar vapor generator 2000 and the outlet 2260. In this manner, by pressurizing the solar vapor generator 2000, higher temperature vapor 2500 may be generated and transported to a second system coupled to the solar vapor generator 2000 for subsequent use.",
                                "In some implementations, the second system may contain a second fluid (i.e., a liquid or a gas) that receives a portion of the heat carried by the vapor 2500. The second fluid may be substantially identical to the vapor 2500 and/or the liquid 2400 or may have a different chemical composition and/or contain different amounts of contaminants and/or impurities. In one example, a contact-based heat exchanger may be used where the vapor 2500 may be flowed directly onto or into the second fluid thus transferring heat to the second fluid. For instance, the solar vapor generator 2000 may be used to produce potable water from a contaminated source where the vapor 2500 is mixed with air such that the heat from the vapor 2500 is used to heat the air for subsequent climate control.",
                                "In another example, the heat exchanger (e.g., a shell/tube heat exchanger) may be used where the heat from the vapor 2500 is transferred to the second fluid through a solid material, such as a metal, a ceramic, or a polymer shaped and dimensioned such that the thermal resistance between the vapor 2500 and the second fluid is relatively small. In this manner, the second fluid may be physically isolated from the vapor 2500 in cases where mixing of the vapor 2500 and the second fluid is undesirable. For instance, the second fluid may be chemically incompatible with the liquid 2400. In another instance, it may be desirable to only transfer heat from the vapor 2500, thus preserving the properties of the vapor 2500, such as in desalination where the vapor 2500 may condense into a more purified state of the liquid 2400.",
                                "In some implementations, the second fluid may be sufficiently heated to cause the second fluid to vaporize (e.g., by evaporation and/or boiling). Thus, a portion of the heat carried by the vapor 2500 may be used to produce additional vapor from a different source of liquid. The second system may also be pressurized using similar approaches to the solar vapor generator 2000. The pressure of the second system may be greater than the ambient pressure, but lower than the pressure of the solar vapor generator 2000. In one aspect, the pressure of the second system may be tailored to allow vapor 2500 to flow from the solar vapor generator 2000 into the second system. In another aspect, the second system may also produce vapor at elevated temperatures and pressures greater than ambient conditions, to then be used in subsequent systems operating at a lower pressure, such as in a multi-stage system.",
                                "The second system may also receive additional heat from other sources, such as the sun, a power plant, or a nuclear reactor. In one example, the second system may be another solar vapor generator 2000 that operates at a lower pressure compared to the first solar vapor generator 2000. Sunlight may be absorbed by the second system to generate heat, which may be used to vaporize the second fluid and/or further superheat the vapor 2500 from the first solar vapor generator 2000 to higher temperatures. In some implementations, the second system may also operate in the dark where no additional heat other than from the vapor 2500 is provided. Under these conditions, the second system may still be pressurized.",
                                "FIG. 21A details an exemplary two-stage system 4000 where the first stage 4100a is a solar vapor generator 2000. Vapor 2500 may flow out of the first stage 4100a via piping 4200 and into a second stage 4100b. The piping 4200 may extend through the second stage 4100b. In some implementations, the second stage 4100b, as illustrated in FIG. 21A, may also be a contactless system that utilizes an emitter, physically separated from a liquid, to radiatively heat a liquid and produce a vapor. The second stage 4100b may receive heat directly from the vapor 2500 (e.g., latent heat released when the vapor 2500 condenses into a liquid) rather than from direct sunlight. For example, in the case where the liquid in both the first stage 4100a and the second stage 4100b is water, it may be preferable in some applications for the first stage 4100a to be pressurized such that the boiling point of the liquid 2400 is at least about 135\u00b0 C., corresponding to a pressure of about 3 atm. A valve 4210 may also be disposed at the outlet 4220a to facilitate pressurization of the first stage 4100a. In this manner, distilled water may be produced at the outlet 4220a and the vapor produced by the second stage 4100b may flow out of the outlet 4220b for direct consumption, into a condenser, or into yet another stage coupled to the two-stage system 4000. In this manner, a plurality of stages may be sequentially arranged to recover a significant portion of the latent heat of vaporization of the first stage. For the second stage 4100b, and subsequent stages, the separation between the basin and the emitter may also substantially reduce fouling of any pipes and/or tubes used for heat exchange and for flowing the vapor generated by the second stage 4100b.",
                                "FIG. 21B shows another exemplary two-stage system 4000 where the first stage 4100a and the second stage 4100b are both a solar vapor generator 2000. In this case, the first stage 4100a may flow vapor 2500 through piping 4200, which is guided through the liquid of the second stage 4100b. In some implementations, as the vapor 2500 flows through the second stage 4100b, latent heat may be released by the vapor 2500 as the vapor 2500 condenses into a liquid. The vapor 2500 and/or liquid may then flow out through the outlet 4220a. A valve 4210 may be included to pressurize the liquid in the first stage 4100a such that the pressure of the first stage 4100a is higher than the pressure of the second stage 4100b such that the boiling point of the liquid 2400 is also higher. In this way the vapor 2500 from the first stage will condense at a higher temperature than the liquid of the second stage will evaporate, such that the heat released when the vapor 2500 from first stage condenses is transferred to the evaporating water in the second stage. The second stage 4100b may also absorb sunlight, which provides an additional heat source to facilitate vaporization of the liquid and superheating of the vapor in the second stage 4100b. Since the second stage 4100b will receive heat from both sunlight and the vapor 2500, the second stage 4100b may be larger in area than the first stage 4100a, or may have a higher vapor productivity. In some implementations, subsequent stages may be coupled in a serial manner to the second stage 4100b (e.g., the second stage 4100b is connected to a third stage, the third stage is connected to a fourth stage, etc.). Each subsequent stage may be operated at a pressure lower than the preceding stage. In this manner, a plurality of stages may be sequentially arranged to recover a significant portion of the latent heat of vaporization of the first stage. This may be controlled, in part, by utilizing a pressure regulation valve on each stage to control the pressure.",

In this manner, a plurality of stages may be sequentially arranged to recover a significant portion of the latent heat of vaporization of the first stage. In some implementations, the vapor 2500 generated by the first stage 4100a may be transported along a relatively long distance to a location where the second stage 4100b and subsequent stages are located.

In another exemplary application, the solar vapor generator 2000 may supply pressurized steam to drive a steam turbine to produce electrical power and a potable source of water. This may be accomplished by incorporating the solar vapor generator 2000 into a Rankine cycle (e.g., an organic Rankine cycle) to supplement or replace a conventional boiler."

The solar vapor generator 3000 was built for the purposes of demonstrating non-contact evaporation of water, as the liquid, and subsequent superheating of steam, as the vapor, at low solar flux levels. The solar vapor generator 3000 includes a basin machined from polyetherimide (PEI), a high temperature polymer, to reduce thermal conduction losses from the water through the sidewall of the basin. PEI is also hydrophobic, hence inhibits salts and other contaminants in the water from climbing up the sidewall of the basin. In this example, the basin is dimensioned to store up to 400 g of water. The solar vapor generator 3000 also includes a housing machined from 6061 aluminum alloy disposed onto the open end of the basin where the interface between the basin and the housing is sealed using a silicone gasket. The housing includes an interior cavity with an open top end, which is substantially filled with RVC foam to increase the flow path of the saturated steam as it passes through the interior cavity to increase superheating. The bottom of the housing facing the basin was painted with a high-emissivity paint Zynolyte\u00ae Hi-Temp, thus forming the emitter. The solar vapor generator 3000 also includes an absorber, comprised of a selective surface (Alanod eta plus\u00ae) attached to a 6061 aluminum substrate using a thin layer of silicone adhesive. A silicone gasket was used to seal the interface between the bottom of the absorber (i.e., the bottom of the aluminium substrate) and the top of the RVC foam and the edge of the housing. The solar vapor generator 3000 was assembled using 12 polyether ether ketone (PEEK) assembly screws. PEEK was chosen to reduce heat conduction from the absorber to the water. Leaks through the screw holes were sealed by silicone washers. The solar vapor generator 3000 also included a thermally insulating cover, according to the exemplary design shown in FIG. 7B, and a thermally insulating enclosure, according to the exemplary design shown in FIG. 8.",
                                "For this laboratory-scale solar vapor generator 3000, the emitter is disposed at a finite distance from the water surface to reduce fouling. When saturated steam is generated by the radiative heating of the water, the saturated steam leaves the basin and enters the housing through 12 discrete vapor holes disposed towards the edges of the housing. In this manner, saturated steam flows laterally through the RVC foam towards the center of the interior cavity, thus increasing the residence time and enhancing solid-vapor heat exchange. This flow arrangement also forces the steam to exit through the hottest part of the system (i.e., the center) thus increasing the degree of superheat. The superheated steam exits through a single outlet tube, inserted into the housing. A custom-built radiation-shielded thermocouple was inserted into the outlet tube to measure the temperature of the superheated vapor.",

FIG. 11A shows a photograph of the laboratory experimental setup. A solar simulator (e.g., ScienceTech, SS-1.6K) outputs simulated sunlight, which is directed onto the solar vapor generator 3000 via a mirror. The solar simulator nominally outputs a solar flux of about 1000 Wm\u22122. Due to the slightly divergent beam exiting the simulator, the flux can be adjusted by moving the beam-down mirror/solar vapor generator 3000 assembly toward/away from the simulator outlet to increase/decrease the flux. The flux can then be fine-tuned by adjusting the current delivered to the lamp. Using both techniques, the flux was varied between 500 and 1800 Wm\u22122 over the course of the experiments. A photodetector (e.g., a thermopile, Newport, 818P-001-12 with a Newport, 818P-001-12) and a camera (e.g., a grayscale CMOS camera, Basler acA1920-25 gm) may be used to measure the intensity and spatial distribution of the simulated sunlight incident on the solar vapor generator 3000, respectively.

The simulator lamp was ignited and allowed to stabilize for at least 10 minutes. Using a grayscale CMOS camera mounted above the simulator (FIG. 11A) a sequence of three grayscale images was acquired. First, a thermopile detector (Newport 1918-C) was placed at the focal plane (FIG. 11B), and a grayscale image was acquired (FIG. 11C) while recording the flux reading from the power meter (Newport 818P-040-55) connected to the thermopile. A correction factor of 0.95 was applied to the power meter reading to account for the difference in thermopile absorptance at the calibration point 1064 nm vs. the solar weighted absorptance. Second, a diffusely reflecting target (Lambertian target) was placed at the focal plane (FIG. 11D), and a grayscale image (FIG. 11E) was acquired. The reflected radiance from the Lambertian target is linearly proportional to the incident flux, such that FIG. 11E represents a relative irradiance map (flux map) at the focal plane.

The empirical data is in solid lines and a theoretical fit is in dashed lines. As shown in FIG. 11I, the experiment exhibits three distinct phases: an initial heat-up phase (illuminated), a quasi-steady-state phase (illuminated), and a cool-down phase (dark). During the heat-up phase, sunlight incident on the solar vapor generator 3000 is absorbed by the absorber, which heats up at a rate of around 2 K/min. Convective losses to the environment are reduced by a novel three-layer transparent polymer glazing system based on FIG. 7B. The glazing, in this instance, achieves an effective heat transfer coefficient of 1.66 W m\u22122 K\u22121, while maintaining a high solar transmittance \u03c4solar of 0.86. Radiation heat losses to the environment are reduced by a spectrally selective absorber material, which has a high solar absorptance \u03b1solar of 0.92 and a low thermal emittance \u03f5thermal of 0.08. Heat is conducted from the absorber to the emitter. As the emitter heats up, it radiates directly to the water reservoir below. This thermal radiation is absorbed in a thin layer (\u02dc30 \u03bcm) at the top of the water surface causing it to heat up at a rate of \u02dc1 K/min. For comparison, conventional heat localizing structures have demonstrated heating rates of 10 K/min under 1 sun. The reason for the comparatively lower heating rate in the solar vapor generator is primarily due to the comparatively high thermal mass of the water reservoir in the solar vapor generator. Faster heat up rates could be achieved, as described above, by reducing the overall lower thermal mass of the solar vapor generator and/or by reducing the initial thickness of the water layer in the reservoir at the start of the experiment. Heat transfer from the emitter to the water surface occurs predominantly by radiation. Contributions from thermal conduction through the air and the sidewalls of the basin were estimated to be relatively small.

Under representative conditions, the detailed model predicts 82% via radiation, 12% via gas gap thermal conduction, and 6% via sidewall conduction. Due to the low Biot number, the water reservoir is heated uniformly, and can be treated as approximately isothermal through the course of the experiment, even though the radiation is absorbed in a thin layer below the surface.",

These results indicate that the solar vapor generator 3000 may be used to generate superheated steam during periods of the year with low solar elevation and moderate solar fluxes.",

                                "A second set of experiments were performed during June and July of 2018 at the same rooftop site located in Cambridge, Mass. FIG. 12E shows the variation of the solar irradiance on a clear day as a function of time. As shown, the global horizontal solar irradiance was measured to be as high 1115 W/m2, which is sufficient to operate the solar vapor generator 3000 without the solar concentrator 3800 described above. The solar flux, in this case, was measured using a Hukseflux LP-02 pyranometer. In these experiments, the superheated steam was collected in a flask where the steam then condensed into a distilled liquid. Specifically, a long FEP tube was connected to the vapor outlet and directed into a volumetric flask. The flask was placed into an ice bath to promote condensation of the superheated vapor onto the flask wall. In this manner, the amount of vapor generated by the solar vapor generator 3000 may be measured.",
                                "FIG. 12F shows the temperatures of various components in the solar vapor generator 3000 measured as a function of time. The empirical data is in solid lines and theoretical fits are in dashed lines. For this particular experiment, 8.9 g of distilled water were condensed and collected, which agrees reasonably well with the measured mass loss of the water in the basin of to 12.8 g. The difference is partially accounted for by 1.6 g of residual water that were condensed on the emitter and in the outlet tubing and thus did not make it to the flask, with the remaining 2.3 g of vapor attributed to a small leak. A similar repeat experiment revealed 9.8 g collected water, 13.2 g evaporated from the basin, and 1.6 g residual water. As shown in FIG. 12F, the steam temperature was measured to be as high as 117\u00b0 C. These results show that the solar vapor generator 3000 can produce superheated vapor, which may then be collected as distilled water, without use of a solar concentrator 3800.",
                                "**Case 5: Fouling Tests of the Solar Vapor Generator**",
                                "Additional laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the fouling resistance of the laboratory-scale solar vapor generator 3000 by using 100 g of synthetic seawater (3.5 wt % NaCl in water). The solar vapor generator 3000 was exposed to a simulated solar flux of one sun for a period of 8 hours, which was a sufficiently long period of time to substantially evaporate the synthetic seawater stored in the solar vapor generator 3000. FIG. 13A shows a photograph of the emitter 3300 after the experiment, with no clear visual indication of salt fouling, e.g. salt crystal formation, on the emitter 3300 surface. Additionally, no fouling was observed in the RVC foam, absorber, or steam outlet, indicating that the salt contained in the synthetic seawater was substantially contained in the basin 3420. FIG. 13B shows a photograph of the basin 3420 after the experiment, where crystals formed by salt precipitated out of the synthetic seawater are evident. However, there was no visual evidence of salt creeping upward along the basin 3420 sidewall above the height of the initial meniscus of the synthetic seawater was observed.",
                                "These experimental results indicate that by physically separating the emitter 3300, the housing, and the absorber from the liquid, fouling may be substantially reduced. It should be appreciated that the reduction in fouling arises based on the design of the solar vapor generator 3000 rather than the use of particular anti-fouling materials. Therefore, the reduction in fouling is not specific to a particular salt. By physically separating the liquid from other components of the solar vapor generator 3000, the reduction in fouling is also less likely to degrade over time, especially in harsher environments compared to conventional anti-fouling materials. Instead, contamination or salt built-up in the basin 3420 may be easily removed by flushing with the liquid (e.g., seawater).",
                                "Furthermore, the solar vapor generator 3000 is less sensitive to any residual fouling of the basin 3420 because the liquid may be used as its own absorber of thermal radiation emitted from the emitter 3300. The basin 3420's primary function is to store the liquid. During experimentation, no substantial changes in evaporation rate, steam temperature, or efficiency were observed when operating the lab-scale solar vapor generator 3000 with seawater compared to pure water. This may be attributed, at least in part, to the similar latent heat of vaporization, hfg, for pure water and brine (e.g., seawater), at least until the point at which salt begins to precipitate, which yields a similar mass flow rate according to Eq. (11). After more than 30 iterations of experiments were performed for the same lab-scale solar vapor generator 3000, no clear visual evidence of biofouling and corrosion induced fouling was observed due, in part, to the high operating temperatures and the materials used in the lab-scale solar vapor generator 3000."

(10) and (11) show that both efficiency and steam temperature can be increased by reducing Uloss. In the lab-scale solar vapor generator design, a main contributor to the losses was the temperature drop between the absorber and emitter, as shown in FIG. 11I. Insight gained from the numerical heat transfer model revealed that the main cause of this temperature drop is the low effective thermal conductivity of the RVC foam (0.05 W m\u22122K\u22121) due to the low solid conductivity of vitreous carbon. This indicates that changing to a graphitic or metallic foam with higher effective thermal conductivity could significant increase the efficiency and superheated steam temperature. To test this hypothesis, the validated numerical model was used to estimate the performance (e.g., efficiency, superheat temperature) of an \u201cimproved solar vapor generator\u201d where the RVC foam is replaced by a copper foam having an effective thermal conductivity of 10.1 W m\u22122K\u22121. FIGS. 14A and 14B show the efficiency and steam temperature for the improved design in comparison to the as-tested lab-scale solar vapor generator. Also shown is the predicted performance for a \u201cscaled-up solar vapor generator,\u201d which includes the copper metal foam and additionally assumes a solar vapor generator that is sufficiently large enough in size such that side-losses may be neglected such that the superheater effectiveness may approach unity. For the improved and scaled-up solar vapor generator designs operating at one sun, the model predicts efficiencies of over 33% and 41%, and steam temperatures of 124\u00b0 C. and 136\u00b0 C., respectively. Moreover, even higher steam temperatures could be achieved by the radiative shielding method shown in the lab-scale demonstrations, as shown in FIG. 14C."

Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to \u201cA and/or B\u201d, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as \u201ccomprising\u201d can refer, in one implementation, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another implementation, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another implementation, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.",
                        "As used herein in the specification and in the claims, \u201cor\u201d should be understood to have the same meaning as \u201cand/or\u201d as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, \u201cor\u201d or \u201cand/or\u201d shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as \u201conly one of\u201d or \u201cexactly one of,\u201d or, when used in the claims, \u201cconsisting of,\u201d will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term \u201cor\u201d as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. \u201cone or the other but not both\u201d) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as \u201ceither,\u201d \u201cone of,\u201d \u201conly one of,\u201d or \u201cexactly one of.\u201d \u201cConsisting essentially of,\u201d when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.",
                        "As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase \u201cat least one,\u201d in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase \u201cat least one\u201d refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, \u201cat least one of A and B\u201d (or, equivalently, \u201cat least one of A or B,\u201d or, equivalently \u201cat least one of A and/or B\u201d) can refer, in one implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another implementation, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.",
                        "In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as \u201ccomprising,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201ccarrying,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d \u201ccontaining,\u201d \u201cinvolving,\u201d \u201cholding,\u201d \u201ccomposed of,\u201d and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases \u201cconsisting of\u201d and \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03."
