The diagnostic criteria for HR+/HER2- luminal breast cancer was based on the receptor status (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in invasive cancer as the following: HR+, more than 1% positive for ER or PR; HER2-, an IHC score of 0 to 1+, or 2+ with non-amplified HER2 by FISH. One hundred sixty-nine HR+/HER2- patients who had concluding pathologic reports and no other malignancies were firstly selected (retrospective cohort study from 2001 to 2017). Seven patients were excluded for the following reasons: 4 cases with incomplete initial diagnostic information, 2 with mucinous carcinoma, and 1 with no available formalin-fixed paraffin embedded block of the primary tumor. The final number of enrollments was 162, including 50 patients with documented recurrence, and 112 patients without any recurrence over 10 years. Clinical properties of patients are shown in Table 1.

The mRNA expression levels of PKM2 were divided in quartiles. An analysis between the top quartile group (top 25%) and the bottom one (bottom 25%) was then compared by log-rank test. FIG. 1A shows that patients with high PKM2 expression exhibited a significantly worse 10-year survival than did those with low PKM2 expression (top 25% vs. bottom 25%, p = 0.005). A significantly worse relapse-free survival was also found for the top-quartile group as compared with the bottom-quartile one (top 25% vs. bottom 25%, p = 0.045).

For antigen retrieval, specimens were incubated with citrate buffer at pH 6.0 (10 mM citrate, 0.05% Tween 20) and autoclaved at 121\u00b0 C. for 20 min. The immunostaining procedures were performed using Novolink Polymer Detection System (Leica) according to the manufacturer\u2019s manual. In brief, tissues were stained with anti-O-GlcNAc or anti-PKM2 for 60 min at room temperature. The working dilution of primary antibody was 1:50 for anti-O-GlcNAc (838004, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and 1:100 for anti-PKM2 (D78A4, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). IHC results were reviewed blindly by two pathologists (CJ Chen and YC Hsu) based on two parameters: the staining intensity score (0 = negative; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; and 3 = strong), and the percentage of immunopositive cells (0-100). The Q score (0-300) was calculated by multiplying these two parameters. Two groups were stratified based on the Q score: low expression (Q \u2264 mean) and high expression (Q > mean). Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical relevance. The experimental results are shown in FIGS. 2A-3D.",

We enrolled 162 subjects (non-recurrent, n = 112, median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 51.0 [16.0] years; recurrent, n = 50, median [IQR] age, 53.0 [22.0] years) who had received breast cancer therapy and were followed up until December, 2018 (median period, 123.4 months, IQR, 107.4-134.1 months) (Table 1). O-GlcNAc and PKM2 were characterized by IHC for each of the samples (FIG. 3A). FIG. 3A is a representative image of IHC profiles, reviewed blindly by two pathologists (CJ Chen and YC Hsu) based on two parameters: the staining intensity score (0 = negative; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; and 3 = strong), and the percentage of immunopositive cells (0-100)(see Sung, W. W. et al. A polymorphic -844T/C in FasL promoter predicts survival and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer. Clin Cancer Res 17, 5991-5999, doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0227 (2011); Chen, C.

The Q score (0-300) was calculated by multiplying these two parameters. Two groups were stratified based on the Q score: low expression (Q\u2264 mean) and high expression (Q > mean); Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical relevance; Low represents Q\u2264 mean; High represents Q > mean; the framed region was magnified, and the magnified images are shown in the lower right corner.",
                                "To assess the association of O-GlcNAc and PKM2 in recurrence, patients were divided into two groups, with or without recurrent status. A group comparison shows that high O-GlcNAc (p = 0.013) or high PKM2 (p < 0.001) is positively associated with risk of recurrence (FIGS. 3B and 3C ). FIG. 3B is a data diagram showing that high O-GlcNAc expression is significantly associated with the risk of recurrence, wherein p values were determined by two-tailed Student\u2019s t test. FIG. 3C is a data diagram showing that high PKM2 expression is significantly associated with the risk of recurrence, wherein p values were determined by two-tailed Student\u2019s t test.",
                                "Furthermore, samples were stratified into two groups using the mean Q score as a threshold. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that high expression of O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcHigh, p = 0.094), PKM2 (PKM2High, p = 0.390), or the combined double-marker status (O-GlcNAcHlghPKM2Hlgh vs. O-GlcNAcLowPKM2Low, p = 0.083) were associated with worse overall survival, despite no statistical significance (FIGS. 3D-3F), wherein p values (high vs. low) were determined by log-rank test, and OS represents overall survival. Interestingly, high expression levels of O-GlcNAc (O-GlcNAcHigh, p = 0.038) or PKM2 (PKM2High, p = 0.032) were significantly associated with worse DFS (FIGS. 3G and 3H). FIG. 3G is a disease-free survival (DFS) curve diagram showing that high expression of O-GlcNAc can predict poor prognosis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, in which p values (high vs. low) were determined by log-rank test, and DFS represents disease-free survival. FIG. 3H is a survival curve diagram showing that high expression of PKM2 can predict poor prognosis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, in which, in which p values (high vs. low) were determined by log-rank test, and DFS represents disease-free survival. Importantly, the combined double-marker status offered an even greater statistical significance (O-GlcNAcHighPKM2High vs. O-GlcNAcLowPKM2Low, p = 0.004) (FIG. 3I). FIG. 3I is a survival curve diagram showing that high expressions of PKM2 and O-GlcNAc can predict poor prognosis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer, in which p values (high vs. low) were determined by log-rank test, and DFS represents disease-free survival.",

Thus, we used logistic regression analysis to evaluate the risk of 10-year DFS based on the CTS5 score, as well as on the IHC status of PKM2 and O-GlcNAc. High expression of either O-GlcNAc (p = 0.006), or PKM2 (p = 0.026) was significantly associated with increased risk of disease progression, and a high score of CTS5 was also linked to an increased risk, yet with less significance (p = 0.073). Next, we built a model to combine the three variables. Overall, the expression of O-GlcNAc/PKM2 showed to provide extra information compared with the conventional CTS5 score in this model (see FIG. 4 and Table 2).",
                                "We then examined the ROC curves of the PKM2, O-GlcNAc, CTS5, PKM2-O-GlcNAc, and PKM2-O-GlcNAc-CTS5 models, respectively. FIG. 4 shows that the combined PKM2-O-GlcNAc-CTS5 model exhibited a greatly improved AUC value (AUC = 0.712) as compared with the CTS5 (AUC = 0.600) and PKM2-O-GlcNAc (AUC = 0.644) models. As shown in FIG. 4, individual factors are not accurate enough to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer. Only when the three are combined, the AUC value (0.712) is significantly higher than other combinations, showing that the combination of the three may be used as a good indicator of the prognosis of breast cancer. Table 2 shows logistic regression analysis of O-GlcNAc, PKM2, and the CTS5 score based on 10-year DFS.",
