# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

### 1. Field of the Invention

- relate to method and kit for evaluating prognosis in patient with breast cancer

### 2. The Prior Art

- discuss limitations of existing methods for evaluating prognosis in breast cancer

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- provide method and kit for evaluating prognosis in patient with breast cancer using pyruvate kinase and O-GlcNAc

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT

- describe method and kit for evaluating prognosis in patient with breast cancer using pyruvate kinase and O-GlcNAc

### Definition

- define terms used in the invention

### High Expression of Pyruvate Kinase Isoenzyme M2 (PKM2) is Associated With Poor Clinical Outcome in Luminal Breast Cancer

- describe association between PKM2 expression and poor clinical outcome in luminal breast cancer

### High Expression of O-Linked Î²-N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) and PKM2 Can Predict Poor Prognosis of HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer

- describe IHC assessment of PKM2 and O-GlcNAc expression
- evaluate clinical relevance of O-GlcNAc and PKM2 expression in HR+/HER2- breast cancer
- show association between high expression of O-GlcNAc and PKM2 and poor prognosis in HR+/HER2- breast cancer

### Logistic Regression and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis

- evaluate risk of 10-year DFS based on CTS5 score, PKM2, and O-GlcNAc expression
