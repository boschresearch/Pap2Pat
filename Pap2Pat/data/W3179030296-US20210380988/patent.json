                        "Ferroptosis is a regulated form of non-apoptotic cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lethal lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Dixon et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2016; Yang and Stockwell, 2016). This process can contribute to pathological cell death in brain, kidney, heart and other tissues (Do Van et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2019; Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014; Hangauer M J, 2017; Hirschhorn and Stockwell, 2019). There is also interest in understanding the role of ferroptosis in cancer, and potentially exploiting this mechanism therapeutically (Dixon, 2019). Interestingly, ferroptosis sensitivity varies substantially between between cancer cells from distinct tissue lineages that express certain tumor suppressors, or have acquired unique cell drug-tolerant or de-differentiated cell states (Hangauer M J, 2017; Jiang et al., 2015; Tsoi et al., 2018; Viswanathan V S, 2017; Yang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019). At the molecular level, mechanisms that can account for the observed variation in ferroptosis sensitivity between cells remain largely elusive.",
                        "Ferroptosis can be initiated by a number of stimuli that disrupt intracellular gluthione-mediated antioxidant systems or directly overload the cell with iron (Stockwell et al., 2017). For example, it is possible to induce ferroptosis by depriving cells of the thiol-containing amino acid cystine (the disulfide of cysteine), a key glutathione precursor, or by directly inhibiting the the reduced glutathione (GSH)-dependent phospholipid hydroperoxiodase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) (Dixon et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). GPX4 catalyzes the reduction of reactive lipid hydroperoxides to non-reactive lipid alcohols. This reaction is essential to prevent a buildup of lipid hydroperoxides, which when free iron is present can participate in Fenton chemistry reactions that lead to the generation of toxic lipid alkoxy radicals and subsequently other reactive lipid breakdown products (Dixon, 2019). The execution of ferroptosis therefore relies on the combined presence of oxidizable lipids (e.g. polyunsaturated phospholipids) and free iron which, in the absence of sufficient GPX4-mediated lipid peroxide detoxification, result in oxidative destruction of the plasma membrane and other internal organelle membranes (Agmon et al., 2018; Magtanong et al., 2019). Physiological stress such as detachment of cells from the extracellular matrix can increase ROS and is sufficient to trigger ferroptosis if GPX4 activity is inhibited (Brown C W, 2017).",
                        "Iron is essential for cell growth but can also promote toxic ROS formation, as occurs during ferroptosis. How intracellular iron homeostasis contributes to ferroptosis sensitivity is only partially understood. Iron can be taken into cells via the transferrin/transferrin receptor system, and genetic silencing of transferrin receptor partially inhibits ferroptosis (Gao et al., 2016; Yang and Stockwell, 2008). NCOA4-mediated, lysosomal-dependent degradation of the iron storage protein ferritin contributes to the pool of free intracellular iron and thereby promotes ferroptosis; genetic depletion of NCOA4 or chemical inhibition of lysosomal acidification both attenuate ferroptosis (Gao et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2016; Torii et al., 2016). Furthermore, manipulation of ferroportin-mediated iron export can alter ferroptosis sensitivity, with reduced ferroportin expression leading to less iron export and increased ferroptosis sensitivity (Geng N, 2018; Ma et al., 2016). Thus, the modulation of intracellular free iron levels by the cellular iron homeostatic network emerges as a key regulator of ferroptosis sensitivity. Interestingly, intracellular free iron levels can vary between cancer cells and cancer cell states (e.g. in metastatic versus non-metastatic cells), which might be expected to contribute to differences in ferroptosis sensitivity (Geng N, 2018). There is also some evidence that iron levels may be dynamically regulated within the cell in response to ferroptosis-inducing conditions, suggesting that uncharacterized regulatory mechanisms may alter intracellular iron, possibly in an attempt to negatively regulate the onset of ferroptosis (Ma et al., 2016)."

                        "Described herein is a cell biological mechanism of ferroptosis resistance that has broad implications for understanding and altering how cells respond, or fail to respond, to pro-ferroptotic conditions. A critical component of this mechanism is the pentaspanin protein prominin2, whose expression can be increased by pharmacological and physiological triggers of ferroptosis. The induction of prominin2 expression in response to ferroptotic stress promotes the formation of MVBs and exosomes that function to transport iron out of the cell and, consequently, impede ferroptosis. The existence of this mechanism suggests that cells have evolved a regulated means to evade ferroptosis that involves limiting the intracellular concentration of this potentially toxic metal in times of stress. Cells that cannot induce prominin2 and export ferritin are therefore highly sensitive to the induction of ferroptosis.",
                        "Free iron is essential for the execution of ferroptosis (Dixon et al., 2012; Dixon et al., 2014). The concept that intracellular iron levels and ferroptosis sensitivity can be modulated on short (<2 h) timescales through the export of ferritin from the cell via an MVB/exosome pathway had not been considered previously. Reducing ferroptosis sensitivity may be a physiological role for the process of MVB-mediated ferritin export observed previously (Truman-Rosentsvit M, 2018). The present results imply that cytosolic iron increases in response to GPX4 inhibition or ECM detachment, but that this iron can be captured, incorporated into MVBs, and exported from the cell if prominin2 expression is sufficient.",
                        "Until now, relatively little was known about the function or regulation of prominin2 in cells. The prominin2-mediated ferroptosis resistance described herein has implications for methods to induce ferroptosis as a mode of anti-cancer therapy. For example, inhibiting GPX4 activity can selectively kill certain tumor cells via ferroptosis (Viswanathan V S, 2017; Yang et al., 2014). Given that cells can acquire resistance to GPX4 inhibition by inducing prominin2, strategies that simultaneousy block prominin2 expression or function may enhance sensitivity to GPX4 inhibitors. Indeed, analysis of the Broad Institute CTRP resource indicated that, across hundreds of cancer cells lines, high levels of prominin2 expression are significantly correlated with resistance to the GPX4 inhibitor ML210 (portals.broadinstitute.org/ctrp/?featureName=PROM2). Prominin2 expression is correlated with poor clinical outcomes in several cancers (Saha et al., 2019); see FIG. 14. Prominin2-mediated MVB formation and iron export may also be relevant to the emerging role of ferroptosis in tumor suppression (Jiang et al., 2015).",
                        "Because prominin2 expression is essential to resisting ferroptoptotic cell death, we next sought to identify the mechanism by which prominin2 expression is regulated. We found that when a cell is experiencing ferroptotic stress via chemical inhibition of GPX4 etc., the transcription factor HSF1 is activated to induce prominin2. Inhibition of HSF1 by siRNA or chemically through KRIBB11 sensitized otherwise resistant cells to death induced by the compounds RSL3, FIN56, erastin, or imidazole ketone erastin.",

The methods include administering one or more inhibitors of prominin2, optionally in combination with one or more promoters of ferroptosis, e.g., GPX4 inhibitors, to a subject in need thereof. The methods can also include administering one or more inhibitors of HSF1 in combination with one or more promoters of ferroptosis, e.g., GPX4 inhibitors, to a subject in need thereof.",

Complementary, as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides. For example, if a nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleotide at the same position of a RNA molecule, then the inhibitory nucleic acid and the RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The inhibitory nucleic acids and the RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, \u201cspecifically hybridisable\u201d and \u201ccomplementary\u201d are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between the inhibitory nucleic acid and the RNA target.

                        "It is understood in the art that a complementary nucleic acid sequence need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridisable. A complementary nucleic acid sequence for purposes of the present methods is specifically hybridisable when binding of the sequence to the target RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target RNA to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the sequence to non-target RNA sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, e.g., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed under suitable conditions of stringency. For example, stringent salt concentration will ordinarily be less than about 750 mM NaCl and 75 mM trisodium citrate, preferably less than about 500 mM NaCl and 50 mM trisodium citrate, and more preferably less than about 250 mM NaCl and 25 mM trisodium citrate. Low stringency hybridization can be obtained in the absence of organic solvent, e.g., formamide, while high stringency hybridization can be obtained in the presence of at least about 35% formamide, and more preferably at least about 50% formamide. Stringent temperature conditions will ordinarily include temperatures of at least about 30\u00b0 C., more preferably of at least about 37\u00b0 C., and most preferably of at least about 42\u00b0 C. Varying additional parameters, such as hybridization time, the concentration of detergent, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the inclusion or exclusion of carrier DNA, are well known to those skilled in the art. Various levels of stringency are accomplished by combining these various conditions as needed. In a preferred embodiment, hybridization will occur at 30\u00b0 C. in 750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate, and 1% SDS.

Wash stringency conditions can be defined by salt concentration and by temperature. As above, wash stringency can be increased by decreasing salt concentration or by increasing temperature. For example, stringent salt concentration for the wash steps will preferably be less than about 30 mM NaCl and 3 mM trisodium citrate, and most preferably less than about 15 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM trisodium citrate. Stringent temperature conditions for the wash steps will ordinarily include a temperature of at least about 25\u00b0 C., more preferably of at least about 42\u00b0 C., and even more preferably of at least about 68\u00b0 C. In a preferred embodiment, wash steps will occur at 25\u00b0 C. in 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM trisodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS.

For example, an antisense compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense oligonucleotide are complementary, and would therefore specifically hybridize, to a target region would represent 90 percent complementarity.

Methods for constructing interfering RNAs are well known in the art. For example, the interfering RNA can be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e., each strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in the other strand; such as where the antisense strand and sense strand form a duplex or double stranded structure); the antisense strand comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof (i.e., an undesired gene) and the sense strand comprises nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. Alternatively, interfering RNA is assembled from a single oligonucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions are linked by means of nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s). The interfering RNA can be a polynucleotide with a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a separate target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. The interfering can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof and the sense region having nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof, and wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siRNA molecule capable of mediating RNA interference.",

Such an RNA molecule when expressed desirably forms a \u201chairpin\u201d structure, and is referred to herein as an \u201cshRNA.\u201d The loop region is generally between about 2 and about 10 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the loop region is from about 6 to about 9 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the sense region and the antisense region are between about 15 and about 20 nucleotides in length. Following post-transcriptional processing, the small hairpin RNA is converted into a siRNA by a cleavage event mediated by the enzyme Dicer, which is a member of the RNase III family. The siRNA is then capable of inhibiting the expression of a gene with which it shares homology.

In general, siRNA containing a nucleotide sequences identical to a portion of the target nucleic acid are preferred for inhibition. However, 100% sequence identity between the siRNA and the target gene is not required to practice the present invention. Thus the invention has the advantage of being able to tolerate sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence. For example, siRNA sequences with insertions, deletions, and single point mutations relative to the target sequence have also been found to be effective for inhibition. Alternatively, siRNA sequences with nucleotide analog substitutions or insertions can be effective for inhibition. In general the siRNAs must retain specificity for their target, i.e., must not directly bind to, or directly significantly affect expression levels of, transcripts other than the intended target.",

Such a cleavage event renders the RNA non-functional.",
                        "In general, enzymatic nucleic acids with RNA cleaving activity act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target binding portion of a enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through complementary base pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After an enzymatic nucleic acid has bound and cleaved its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.",

The hammerhead ribozyme, for example, functions with a catalytic rate (kcat) of about 1 min\u22121 in the presence of saturating (10 rnM) concentrations of Mg2+ cofactor. An artificial \u201cRNA ligase\u201d ribozyme has been shown to catalyze the corresponding self-modification reaction with a rate of about 100 min\u22121. In addition, it is known that certain modified hammerhead ribozymes that have substrate binding arms made of DNA catalyze RNA cleavage with multiple turn-over rates that approach 100 min\u22121.",

                        "In some embodiments, the inhibitory nucleic acids used in the methods described herein are modified, e.g., comprise one or more modified bonds or bases. A number of modified bases include phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate, peptide nucleic acids, or locked nucleic acid (LNA) molecules. Some inhibitory nucleic acids are fully modified, while others are chimeric and contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide. These inhibitory nucleic acids typically contain at least one region of modified nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, for example, increased nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the target) and a region that is a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. Chimeric inhibitory nucleic acids of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides and/or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide is a gapmer (contain a central stretch (gap) of DNA monomers sufficiently long to induce RNase H cleavage, flanked by blocks of LNA modified nucleotides; see, e.g., Stanton et al., Nucleic Acid Ther. 2012. 22: 344-359; Nowotny et al., Cell, 121:1005-1016, 2005; Kurreck, European Journal of Biochemistry 270:1628-1644, 2003; FLuiter et al., Mol Biosyst. 5(8):838-43, 2009).

LNAs also have increased affinity to base pair with RNA as compared to DNA. These properties render LNAs especially useful as probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization, as knockdown tools for miRNAs, and as antisense oligonucleotides to target mRNAs or other RNAs, e.g., RNAs as described herien.",
                        "The LNA molecules can include molecules comprising 10-30, e.g., 12-24, e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleotides in each strand, wherein one of the strands is substantially identical, e.g., at least 80% (or more, e.g., 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%) identical, e.g., having 3, 2, 1, or 0 mismatched nucleotide(s), to a target region in the RNA. The LNA molecules can be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.",
                        "The LNA molecules can be designed using any method known in the art; a number of algorithms are known, and are commercially available (e.g., on the internet, for example at exiqon.com). See, e.g., You et al., Nuc. Acids. Res. 34:e60 (2006); McTigue et al., Biochemistry 43:5388-405 (2004); and Levin et al., Nuc. Acids. Res. 34:e142 (2006). For example, \u201cgene walk\u201d methods, similar to those used to design antisense oligos, can be used to optimize the inhibitory activity of the LNA; for example, a series of oligonucleotides of 10-30 nucleotides spanning the length of a target RNA can be prepared, followed by testing for activity. Optionally, gaps, e.g., of 5-10 nucleotides or more, can be left between the LNAs to reduce the number of oligonucleotides synthesized and tested. GC content is preferably between about 30-60%. General guidelines for designing LNAs are known in the art; for example, LNA sequences will bind very tightly to other LNA sequences, so it is preferable to avoid significant complementarity within an LNA. Contiguous runs of more than four LNA residues, should be avoided where possible (for example, it may not be possible with very short (e.g., about 9-10 nt) oligonucleotides). In some embodiments, the LNAs are xylo-LNAs.",

Plasma transaminase levels were in the normal range (AST \u00be 45, ALT \u00be 35) for all doses with the exception of the 75 mg/kg dose of miR-122 ASO, which showed a very mild increase in ALT and AST levels. They concluded that 50 mg/kg was an effective, non-toxic dose. Another study by Krutzfeldt J., et al., (2005) Nature 438, 685-689, injected anatgomirs to silence miR-122 in mice using a total dose of 80, 160 or 240 mg per kg body weight. The highest dose resulted in a complete loss of miR-122 signal. In yet another study, locked nucleic acids (\u201cLNAs\u201d) were successfully applied in primates to silence miR-122. Elmen J., et al., (2008) Nature 452, 896-899, report that efficient silencing of miR-122 was achieved in primates by three doses of 10 mg kg-1 LNA-antimiR, leading to a long-lasting and reversible decrease in total plasma cholesterol without any evidence for LNA-associated toxicities or histopathological changes in the study animals.",

The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.",
                        "The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography."

                                "To gain insight into mechanisms that promote ferroptosis resistance, we exploited our recent finding that detachment of certain cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a pro-ferroptotic stress (Brown, 2018; Brown C W, 2017). We reasoned that cells that can survive under detached conditions may do so by upregulating a protective gene expression program that prevents cell death. To identify such genes, we compared mRNA expression in adherent and ECM-detached MCF10A immortalized breast epithelial cells by RNA-sequencing (GSE115059). PROM2, which encodes the pentaspanin protein prominin2, captured our attention because its expression was significantly increased in ECM-detached cells compared to adherent cells. Also, it is thought to have a role in lipid dynamics and membrane organization, processes that could be relevant for ferroptosis resistance (Doll S, 2017; Florek M, 2007; J\u00e1szai J, 2010; Singh R D, 2013). We confirmed in MCF10A cells that prominin2 was rapidly upregulated in response to ECM detachment at the protein and mRNA level (FIGS. 1A,B). Increased PROM2 was also observed in detached versus attached Hs578t breast cancer cells (FIG. 1B). Silencing of prominin2 expression in both MCF10A and Hs578t cells resulted in a significant loss of viability in ECM-detached conditions (FIGS. 1B,C). Cell viability under these conditions was rescued by co-treatment with a specific inhibitor of ferroptosis, ferrostatin-1 (Dixon et al., 2012), but not the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk (FIG. 1C). These data indicate that failure to upregulate PROM2 upon ECM detachment can result in the induction of ferroptosis.",
                                "We next investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of GPX4 altered prominin2 expression and impacted ferroptosis in adherent cells. MCF10A and Hs578t cells were treated with RSL3, a covalent GPX4 inhibitor (Yang et al., 2014), for 2 hrs resulted in increased prominin2 mRNA and protein expression in both cell lines (FIGS. 1D,E). This effect was not a generic response to ROS stress because culturing with H2O2 did not increase prominin2 expression in either MCF10A or Hs578t cells (FIG. 8A). Moreover, expression of a related family member, prominin1 (CD133), was not altered significantly by RSL3, further demonstrating the specificity of the ferroptotic effect for prominin2 (FIG. 8A). Unlike MCF10A and Hs578t cells, RSL3 did not induce prominin2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, another breast cancer cell line (FIGS. 1D,E). We observed that the induction of prominin2 expression correlated with resistance to GPX4 inhibitor-induced ferroptosis: MCF10A and Hs578t cells were resistant to RSL3-induced cell death at concentrations up to 2.5 while MDA-MB-231 cells were killed by RSL3 concentrations as low as 0.5 \u03bcM (FIG. 1F).",
                                "Given the above results, we assessed whether prominin2 was necessary for resistance to ferroptosis. For this purpose, we silenced prominin2 expression in MCF10A and Hs578t cells (FIG. 8B) and examined the sensitivity of these cells to ferroptosis compared to control cells. Here, we tested the covalent GPX4 inhibitors RSL3, ML210 (We\u00efwer M, 2012), the indirect GPX4 inhibitor FIN56 (Shimada K, 2016), and the GSH-depleting agent erastin, which reduces GPX4 activity indirectly by preventing the synthesis of its key cofactor (Dixon et al., 2012). Control MCF10A cells were more resistant to these compounds than Hs578t cells (FIGS. 2A,B). Nonetheless, a significant increase in sensitivity to all four compounds was observed in prominin2 knock-down cells compared to control cells for both cell lines (FIGS. 2A,B, 9A,B). Loss of cell viability in prominin2-depleted cells was completely rescued by ferrostatin-1, indicating that the greater sensitivity of prominin2-silenced cells was not caused by the induction of an alternative mode of cell death (FIG. 2C). Given the results obtained with genetic silencing, we next tested whether overexpression of prominin2 was sufficient to inhibit ferroptosis. Indeed, in MDA-MB-231 cells exogenous prominin2 expression was sufficient to inhibit cell death in response to RSL3, ML210, FIN56 and erastin (FIGS. 2D, 9C,D). Thus, prominin2 expression promotes resistance to ferroptosis. Subsequent experiments were performed using RSL3 as a prototypic GPX4 inhibitor."

                                "To gain insight into how prominin2 may promote ferroptosis resistance, we assessed its subcellular localization following GPX4 inhibition. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that prominin2 localizes in discrete cytoplasmic puncta in response to GPX4 inhibition by RSL3 (FIGS. 3A, 10A). As determined using organelle-specific markers, these puncta did not co-localize with early endosomes (Rab5A), peroxisomes (catalase), caveolae (phospho-Caveolin-1), autophagosomes (LC3) or mitochondria (Mitotracker) (FIG. 10B). By contrast, a striking co-localization was observed between prominin2 and TSG101, a marker of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (Razi M, 2006) (FIGS. 3A, 10A). MVBs are late endosomes containing cargo within their lumen bound in intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (Felder S, 1990; Gruenberg J, 1995). The cargo can be sorted for degradation in lysosomes or released into the extracellular space as exosomes (Futter C E, 1996; Hart P D, 1991). The co-localization of prominin2 and TSG101 was evident as early as 30 min following the inhibition of GPX4 and this co-localization was most prominent in the perinuclear region (FIG. 3B, 11A). At later times (1.5 to 2 hrs), this co-localization was evident throughout the cytoplasm. We also observed that prominin2 exhibited some co-localization with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 (Cella N, 1996) (FIG. 10C), which is expected given that some MVBs are trafficked to lysosomes (Futter C E, 1996; Razi M, 2006). However, we discounted a role for lysosomes in ferroptosis resistance under these conditions based on the observation that NH4Cl treatment, which inhibits lysosome function (Hart P D, 1991), had no effect on cell survival following GPX4 inhibition (FIG. 10D).",
                                "The above results prompted us to assess whether prominin-2 promotes MVB formation in response to GPX4 inhibition. RSL3-treated MCF10A and Hs578t cells contained more TSG101-positive structures than vehicle control-treated cells, indicating that GPX4 inhibition induces MVB formation (FIGS. 3A,B, 11A). Prominin2 localization to MVBs in RSL3-treated MCF10A and Hs578t cells was confirmed by co-localization with Alix and CD9 (FIGS. 11B, C). We then evaluated whether the formation of these structures was dependent on prominin2 using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Indeed, RSL3-treated MCF10A cells contained significantly more MVBs per cell than control cells, an effect that was not observed in prominin2-silenced cells (FIG. 3C). Notably, this RSL3-stimulated increase in MVBs was rapid (within 2 hr). Immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed a reduction in TSG101-positive puncta in prominin2-depleted MCF10A and Hs578t cells compared to control cells (FIGS. 3D,E, 12A,B). Conversely, exogenous prominin2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells increased the number of TSG101-positive structures and, as noted above, reduced ferroptosis sensitivity (FIGS. 3F, 12C). Consistent with a causal role for MVBs in ferroptosis resistance, diminishing TSG101 expression increased the sensitivity of MCF10A and Hs578t cells to RSL3-induced cell death (FIGS. 4A,B, 13A) and this death was rescued with ferrostatin-1 (FIG. 4C). These data indicate that GPX4 inhibition stimulates prominin2 expression and prominin2-dependent MVB formation, which promote ferroptosis resistance.",
                                "MVBs can fuse with the plasma membrane and release intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) as exosomes (Harding C, 1984; Pan B T, 1985). Indeed, we observed distinct ILVs in MVBs consistent with the size of exosomes (\u02dc80 nm) (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013) in RSL3-treated cells (FIG. 3C). To assess the impact of GPX4 inhibition on exosome formation, exosomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation from control (DMSO) and RSL3-treated MCF10A and Hs578t cells. The presence of an exosome fraction was confirmed by TEM (FIG. 13B). GPX4 inhibition increased exosome formation as evidenced by the fact that a significant amount of protein was present in the exosome preparation of RSL3-treated cells (FIG. 4D). In contrast, exosomal protein in control cells was not detected in this experiment (data not shown). Analysis of these exosomes by immunoblotting revealed that they contained prominin2, Alix and TSG101 providing evidence that they were generated by prominin2-dependent MVB formation (FIG. 4D). Importantly, they did not contain GM130, a Golgi marker, indicating that their isolation was not contaminated with other cell membranes (FIG. 4E). To test whether exosome release was essential for resistance to GPX4 inhibition, we used the sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869 and found that inhibition of exosome release increased the sensitivity of MCF10A and Hs578t cells to RSL3 (FIG. 4F)."

                                "Our results indicated that prominin2-mediated MVB and exosome formation promote ferroptosis resistance. We hypothesized that this resistance mechanism involved MVBs and exosome-mediated export of a factor that would otherwise promote ferroptosis. Given that the iron storage protein ferritin can be secreted from cells in exosomes (Truman-Rosentsvit M, 2018), we hypothesized that MVB/exosome-mediated ferritin export inhibits ferroptosis. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that ferritin co-localized with prominin2 in RSL3-treated MCF10A and Hs578t cells, but not in vehicle control (DMSO)-treated cells (FIG. 5A). We also identified ferritin protein in exosomes harvested from these cells (FIG. 5B). These exosomes contained iron as detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (3400 ng per exosome collection sample), further supporting our hypothesis. MDA-MB-231 cells do not increase ferritin expression following GPX4 inhibition. However, the expression of exogenous prominin2 induced a more punctate pattern of ferritin localization in RSL3-treated compared to control cells (FIG. 5C). An alternative explanation for our findings was that prominin2 enhanced the membrane localization of the iron exporter ferroportin, which has been shown to play a role in ferroptosis sensitivity (Geng N, 2018). However this did not appear to be the case because prominin2 did not co-localize with ferroportin (SLC40A1) (FIG. 13C).",
                                "A causal role for ferritin in ferroptosis resistance is supported by the finding that knock-down of both the ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) and light chain (FTL) increased cell death triggered by GPX4 inhibition in both MCF10A and Hs578t cells (FIGS. 5D,E, 13D). Importantly, this death was rescued by either ferrostatin-1 or the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), providing evidence for its ferroptotic nature (FIG. 5F).",
                                "Our data suggested that GPX4 inhibition stimulates the formation of MVBs containing ferritin and that these structures transport iron out of the cell. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the free iron concentration in control and RSL3-treated MCF10A and Hs578t cells and observed no significant difference between these two groups (FIG. 6A). However, when either prominin2 or both FTH1 and FTL were silenced, we observed an increase the concentration of free iron following RSL3 treatment (FIGS. 6A,B, S6D). Additional evidence for prominin2 regulation of iron levels was obtained by quantifying free iron in control and prominin2-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells in response to GPX4 inhibition. Prominin2 expression in these cells prevented the increase in iron in response to RSL3 that was observed in control cells (FIG. 6C). Also, disabling the MVB pathway by decreasing expression of TSG101 significantly increased the concentration of free intracellular iron following GPX4 inhibition (FIG. 6D). These results indicate that blocking MVB/exosome-mediated ferritin export results in an accumulation of intracellular iron upon GPX4 inhibition."

Indeed, cell death in ECM-detached, prominin2-depleted MCF10A and Hs578t cells was rescued by the iron chelator deferoxamine, consistent with a defect in iron export promoting cell death (FIG. 7A). Also, ECM detachment increased the concentration of free iron in prominin2-depleted compared to control cells, an effect that was most noticeable 2 hrs post-detachment, which is coincident with the onset of ferroptosis (FIG. 7B). Similar to RSL3-treated adherent cells, ECM detachment increased the frequency of MVBs based on TEM analysis and this increase was dependent on prominin2 (FIG. 7C). Exosome release is indicated by the fusion of an MVB with the plasma membrane (FIG. 7C). Co-localization of prominin2 and TSG101 was also evident in ECM-detached MCF10A and Hs578t cells (FIG. 7D), similar to the co-localization seen in adherent, RSL3-treated cells (FIG. 3A).

To address this issue, we examined ENCODE ChIP-seq data to identify transcription factors that can bind near the PROM2 promoter region. This unbiased approach yielded the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) as the top candidate (FIG. 15A). HSF1 can induce or repress expression of genes involved in cell survival, metabolism, proliferation and immune evasion (reviewed in Dong B, 2019).",
                                "Initially, we evaluated the expression of HSF1 mRNA by qPCR in response to 4HNE or RSL3 and observed a significant increase that peaked at 15 minutes after treatment (FIG. 15B). To ascertain the role of p38 in the increase in HSF1 expression, we pre-treated MCF10A cells with the p38 inhibitor BIRB and then exposed the cells to 4HNE or RSL3. Inhibition of p38 reduced the 4HNE- or RLS3-driven increase in HSF1 to basal levels after 30 minutes of treatment (FIG. 15C). HSF1 transcriptional activity can be regulated by its expression and phosphorylation on S326 (Guettouche T, 2005). 4HNE and RSL3 increased HSF1 protein expression levels as well as phosphorylation at S326 after 60 minutes of exposure (FIG. 15D). We also observed that BIRB prevented the induction and phosphorylation of HSF1 following 4HNE or RSL3 treatment, further indicating that this increase in HSF1 activity is dependent on p38 (FIG. 15D).",

Indeed, HSF1 expression and nuclear localization increased after 60 minutes of exposure to either 4HNE or RSL3 (FIG. 15E). Treatment with BIRB prior to 4HNE or RSLE significantly reduced the increase in expression and nuclear localization, substantiating the role of p38 in activating HSF1. These data describe a clear role for p38 in the increased expression and activation of HSF1 following a lipid peroxidation stressor.",

MCF10A cells were transfected with either control or HSF1 targeting siRNA and assessed for their ability to increase prominin2 expression after 4HNE or RSL3 treatment. Cells depleted of HSF1 were able to increase p38 activation in response to 4HNE but not increase prominin2 expression compared to control cells (FIG. 15F). Importantly, the loss of HSF1 significantly reduced the EC50 of RSL3 required to kill MCF10A cells (FIG. 15G). Taken together, these data implicate a key and novel role for HSF1 in ferroptosis resistance by a mechanism that involves its ability to drive PROM2 transcription.",

Targeting HSF1 could be an effective bypass strategy as an alternative to prominin2 inhibitors. To address this possibility, we used KRIBB11, which directly targets HSF1 by inhibiting its activity as a transcription factor (Yoon Y J, 2011). Inhibition of HSF1 activity by KRIBB11 prevented the upregulation of PROM2 mRNA and prominin2 protein expression in response to either 4HNE or RSL3 (FIG. 16A, D). However, neither the expression, phosphorylation nor nuclear localization of HSF1 was affected by KRIBB11 (FIGS. 16B, C, D), consistent with its mode of action.",

The ability of MCF10A cells to evade cell death with all three compounds was significantly when given in concert with KRIBB11 (FIG. 16E). This phenomenon was specific to ferroptosis because co-treatment with other therapeutics including dasatinib and erlotinib did not significantly improve sensitivity (FIG. 16F). These data indicate that HSF1 specifically drives a ferroptosis-resistance program and that co-treatment with a ferroptosis inducing agent and an HSF1 inhibitor can induce ferroptosis in otherwise resistant cells.",

We assessed whether KRIBB11 increased their sensitivity to either RSL3 or IKE.
