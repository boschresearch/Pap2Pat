    "abstract": "Understanding how cancer cells resist ferroptosis is a significant problem that impacts ongoing efforts to stimulate ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy. We reported that prominin2 is induced by ferroptotic stimuli and functions to resist ferroptotic death. Although this finding has significant implications for therapy, specific prominin2 inhibitors are not available. We rationalized that the mechanism by which prominin2 expression is induced by ferroptotic stress could be targeted, expanding the range of options to overcome ferroptosis resistance. Here, we show that that 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), a specific lipid metabolite formed from the products of lipid peroxidation stimulates PROM2 transcription by a mechanism that involves p38 MAP kinase-mediated activation of HSF1 and HSF1-dependent transcription of PROM2. HSF1 inhibitors sensitize a wide variety of resistant cancer cells to drugs that induce ferroptosis. Importantly, the combination of a ferroptosis-inducing drug and an HSF1 inhibitor causes the cytostasis of established tumors in mice, although neither treatment alone is effective. These data reveal a novel approach for the therapeutic induction of ferroptosis in cancer.",

                "Elucidating mechanisms that enable cancer cells to resist ferroptosis, a regulated form of non\u2010apoptotic cell death characterized by the accumulation of peroxidated lipids, is critical for understanding the nature of ferroptosis in cancer and exploiting its therapeutic potential (Dixon\u00a0et\u00a0al, 2012; Yang & Stockwell, 2016; Yang et\u00a0al, 2016). Stimuli that disrupt intracellular glutathione\u2010mediated antioxidant systems can trigger ferroptosis. For example, inhibition of the xCT transporter reduces intracellular cystine, a key precursor of glutathione (GSH). This results in a reduction of available GSH to act as a co\u2010factor for glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), the main protein involved in reducing lipid peroxidation (Dixon et\u00a0al, 2012; Yang et\u00a0al, 2014). The fact that ferroptosis sensitivity varies widely among cancer cell types indicates that some cancer cells can resist the lipid peroxidation damage that is the root cause of ferroptosis (Yang et\u00a0al, 2014). This issue is of profound importance for ongoing efforts aimed at stimulating ferroptosis as a therapeutic approach for cancer (Ou et\u00a0al, 2017; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2019). A paramount example of this problem is the observation that some tumor cells are highly susceptible to GPX4 inhibition while others are not (Yang et\u00a0al, 2014; Hangauer et\u00a0al, 2017).",
                "Recently, we described a novel mechanism of ferroptosis resistance that involves the pentaspanin protein prominin2 (Brown et\u00a0al, 2019). In cells that are resistant to ferroptosis, the expression of prominin2 is induced rapidly by stimuli that increase lipid peroxidation including GPX4 inhibition and detachment from the extracellular matrix. Prominin2 promotes the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that contain iron\u2010laden ferritin. The export of these MVBs as exosomes reduces the intracellular iron concentration and, consequently, results in the evasion of ferroptosis. A key finding in this study was that depletion of prominin2 expression renders otherwise resistant cells vulnerable to ferroptosis. Although this finding has significant implications for therapy, specific prominin2 inhibitors are not available. We therefore rationalized that the mechanism by which prominin2 expression is induced by ferroptotic stress could be targeted as well, expanding the range of options to reduce ferroptosis resistance.",
                "In this study, we discovered that a metabolite resulting from degraded, peroxidated lipids, 4\u2010hydroxynonenal (4HNE) stimulates PROM2 transcription by a mechanism that is dependent upon heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that specific inhibition of HSF1 overcomes resistance to GPX4 inhibition and significantly increases the sensitivity of resistant cancer cells in\u00a0vitro and tumors in\u00a0vivo to ferroptosis. This finding increases our understanding of mechanisms used by cells to resist ferroptosis, and it has potentially valuable implications for improving therapies aimed at stimulating ferroptosis in cancer."

                        "Initially, we sought to determine the nature of the stimulus that induces prominin2 expression in cells that are resistant to ferroptosis. Treatment of MCF10A cells with the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 resulted in a time\u2010dependent increase in PROM2 mRNA expression that was significant at 60\u00a0min and peaked at 120\u00a0min (Fig\u00a01A). Induction of PROM2 mRNA was blocked by ferrostatin\u20101 (fer\u20101), a specific inhibitor of lipid peroxidation (Fig\u00a01B). Given that ferroptosis is an iron\u2010dependent process, we treated MCF10A cells with exogenous iron in the form of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), which also resulted in an induction of PROM2 mRNA. However, this iron\u2010dependent increase in PROM2 was inhibited by ferrostatin\u20101 (Fig\u00a0EV1A) indicating that the ability of iron to induce PROM2 expression derives from its ability to trigger lipid peroxides and not its independent signaling capacity.",
                        "The metabolites that result from the breakdown of peroxidated lipids have significant signaling capacity (Esterbauer et\u00a0al, 1982, 1990). These metabolites include malondialdehyde (MDA), 4\u2010hydroxynonenal (4HNE), 4\u2010hydroxyhexenal (4HHE), 4\u2010oxo\u2010nonenal (4ONE), among others. We observed that exposure of MCF10A cells to 4HNE was sufficient to increase PROM2 mRNA significantly in the absence of ferroptotic stress (Fig\u00a01C). As expected, ferrostatin\u20101 pretreatment did not rescue this increase in expression because 4HNE is downstream of the oxidized lipids (Fig\u00a01D). Both RSL3 and 4HNE increased prominin2 protein expression after 1\u00a0h of treatment (Fig\u00a01E). In contrast, exposure to neither MDA, 4ONE nor 4HHE significantly impacted the expression of prominin2 (Fig\u00a0EV1B). Importantly, RSL3 treatment increased the level of 4HNE as evidenced by its ability to increase the formation of 4HNE protein adducts, which can be detected by immunoblotting, similar to the level observed with exogenous 4HNE treatment (Fig\u00a01E). In contrast, exposure to MDA did not significantly impact the expression of prominin2 (Fig\u00a01F). This result is consistent with the fact that 4HNE is a stress\u2010derived aldehyde that can act as a \u201csecond messenger\u201d of redox signaling and modulate signaling pathways and transcriptional programs (Codreanu et\u00a0al, 2009; Smathers et\u00a0al, 2011), while MDA oxidizes and cross\u2010links DNA (Niedernhofer et\u00a0al, 2003)."

                        "4HNE signals by forming Michael adducts with target kinases resulting in their phosphorylation and activation (Amarnath et\u00a0al, 1998). The p38/MAPK cascade has been shown to be a specific target of 4HNE (Zarrouki et\u00a0al, 2007; Zheng et\u00a0al, 2013), and there is evidence that 4HNE forms adducts with p38 that trigger its phosphorylation and activation (Usatyuk & Natarajan, 2004). Consistent with these findings, we observed that 4HNE or RSL3 stimulation of MCF10A cells increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase at 60\u00a0min of treatment, a time frame consistent with its ability to induce prominin2 expression (Fig\u00a02A). We also assessed whether p38 is a direct target of 4HNE by immunoprecipitating phospho\u2010p38 (Tyr180/Thr182) and immunoblotting for the 4HNE adduct. We found that 4HNE was bound to phospho\u2010p38 in 4HNE\u2010treated but not in control cells, indicating that p38 is a direct target of 4HNE (Fig\u00a02B).",
                        "To evaluate whether p38 contributes to the induction of PROM2 expression, cells were treated with either 4HNE or RSL3 in the presence or absence of BIRB, a specific p38 inhibitor. Inhibition of p38 prevented the induction of PROM2 mRNA expression by either 4HNE or RSL3 (Fig\u00a02C) but BIRB treatment alone did not affect prominin2 protein levels (Fig\u00a0EV2C). These results were recapitulated at the protein level in both MCF10A cells and the breast cancer cell line Hs578t, showing an increase in prominin2 that is dependent on the presence of an active p38 (Figs\u00a02D and EV2A). Similar findings were obtained with SB202190, another pan\u2010p38 inhibitor (Fig\u00a0EV2D). These data demonstrate that 4HNE\u2010stimulated p38 activity drives the increase in prominin2 expression.",
                        "A similar experiment was performed to determine the contribution of p38 to ferroptosis resistance. MCF10A and Hs578t cells were treated with BIRB, RSL3, or a combination of the two for 12\u00a0h and surviving cells were quantified. Neither BIRB nor RSL3 alone affected cell survival. However, their combined treatment reduced survival by 50%, indicating that p38 signaling is a key component of ferroptosis resistance (Figs\u00a02E and EV2B). Together, these data indicate that cells can resist ferroptosis by activating p38 and, consequently, inducing prominin2."

                        "The critical issue that arose from our p38 data is how this kinase induces PROM2 mRNA expression. To address this issue, we utilized a compilation of ENCODE ChIP\u2010seq data to identify transcription factors that bind within the PROM2 promoter, gene body, or enhancer regions. Searching this database for transcription factors binding to PROM2 served as an unbiased approach that yielded the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) as a notably strong PROM2 interactor (Fig\u00a03A). HSF1 can induce or repress expression of genes involved in cell survival, metabolism, proliferation, and immune evasion (reviewed in ref. Dong et\u00a0al (2019)), and proteins involved in the regulation of HSF1 have been reported to be involved in sensitivity to erastin\u2010induced ferroptosis (Sun et\u00a0al, 2015). Taken together, these data suggest a connection between HSF1, ferroptosis, and prominin2.",
                        "Initially, we evaluated the expression of HSF1 mRNA by qPCR in response to 4HNE or RSL3 and observed a significant increase that peaked at 15\u00a0min after treatment (Fig\u00a03B). To ascertain the role of p38 in the increase in HSF1 expression, we pretreated MCF10A cells with the p38 inhibitor BIRB and then exposed the cells to 4HNE or RSL3. Inhibition of p38 reduced the 4HNE\u2010 or RSL3\u2010driven increase in HSF1 to basal levels after 30\u00a0min of treatment (Fig\u00a03C). HSF1 transcriptional activity can be regulated by its expression and phosphorylation on S326 (Guettouche et\u00a0al, 2005). 4HNE and RSL3 increased HSF1 protein expression levels, as well as its phosphorylation at S326 after 60\u00a0min of exposure (Figs\u00a03D and EV3A). We also observed that BIRB prevented the induction and phosphorylation of HSF1 following 4HNE or RSL3 treatment in both MCF10A and Hs578t cells, further indicating that this increase in HSF1 activity is dependent on p38 (Figs\u00a03D and EV3A). Importantly, overexpression of prominin2 in MCF10A cells (Fig\u00a0EV3C) diminished their sensitivity to p38 and HSF1 inhibition (Fig\u00a0EV3D).",
                        "Nuclear localization is required for the transcriptional function of HSF1 (Sarge et\u00a0al, 1993). Indeed, HSF1 expression and nuclear localization increased after 60\u00a0min of exposure to either 4HNE or RSL3 (Figs\u00a03B and EV3B). Treatment with BIRB prior to 4HNE or RSL3 significantly reduced the increase in expression and nuclear localization of HSF1, substantiating the role of p38 in activating HSF1 (Fig\u00a03D and E). These data describe a clear role for p38 in the increased expression and activation of HSF1 in response to lipid peroxidation.",
                        "Based on our finding that HSF1 is required for the increase in prominin2 expression, we investigated whether it is necessary for prominin2\u2010mediated resistance to ferroptosis. MCF10A cells were transfected with pooled siRNAs (control or HSF1) as used in Ref. (Kammanadiminti & Chadee, 2006; Jeong et\u00a0al, 2015) and assessed for their ability to increase prominin2 expression after either 4HNE or RSL3 treatment. Cells depleted of HSF1 were able to increase p38 activation in response to 4HNE but not to increase prominin2 expression compared to control cells (Fig\u00a03F). Moreover, knockdown of HSF1 increased the sensitivity of MCF10A cells to RSL3, an effect that was rescued partially by ferrostatin\u20101 (Figs\u00a03G and EV3E) suggesting that non\u2010ferroptotic cell death may also contribute. Taken together, these data implicate a key role for HSF1 in ferroptosis resistance by a mechanism that involves its ability to drive PROM2 transcription."

                        "The data we obtained implicating HSF1 in ferroptosis resistance provided a potentially significant opportunity for sensitizing cells to ferroptosis because specific HSF1 inhibitors are available. Because prominin2 inhibitors are not currently available, targeting HSF1 could be an effective bypass strategy. To address this possibility, we used KRIBB11, which directly targets HSF1 by inhibiting its ability to recruit the elongation factor pTEFb (Yoon et\u00a0al, 2011). Inhibition of HSF1 activity by KRIBB11 prevented the upregulation of PROM2 mRNA (Fig\u00a04A ) and prominin2 protein expression (Fig\u00a0EV4A) in response to either 4HNE or RSL3. However, treatment with KRIBB11 alone had no significant effect on either PROM2 or HSF1 mRNA expression (Fig\u00a0EV4 D and E). Moreover, neither the expression, phosphorylation, nor nuclear localization of HSF1 was affected by KRIBB11 (Figs\u00a04B, C, and D and EV4A), consistent with its reported mechanism of action (Yoon et\u00a0al, 2011).",
                        "Having identified HSF1 as a key mediator of prominin2 expression and, consequently, the evasion of ferroptosis, we co\u2010treated MCF10A cells with KRIBB11 and either RSL3, imidazole\u00a0ketone erastin (IKE), or FIN56, compounds that induce ferroptosis through three separate mechanisms (Yang & Stockwell, 2008; Dixon et\u00a0al, 2012; Yang et\u00a0al, 2014; Shimada et\u00a0al, 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al, 2019). The ability of MCF10A cells to evade cell death with all three compounds was significantly decreased when given in concert with KRIBB11 (Fig\u00a04E). The cell death induced by the combination of IKE and KRIBB11 was rescued by co\u2010treatment with ferrostatin\u20101 but not ZVAD\u2010fmk, indicating that the cells were dying by ferroptosis (Fig\u00a0EV4B). This phenomenon was specific to ferroptosis because co\u2010treatment with other therapeutics including dasatinib and erlotinib did not significantly improve sensitivity (Fig\u00a0EV4C). These data indicate that HSF1 specifically drives a ferroptosis\u2010resistance program and that co\u2010treatment with a ferroptosis\u2010inducing agent and an HSF1 inhibitor can induce ferroptosis in otherwise resistant cells.",
                        "Although MCF10A cells, immortalized mammary epithelial cells, are considered \u201cnormal\u201d, their ability to survive in anoikis conditions suggests otherwise (Brown et\u00a0al, 2017). To evaluate whether the combination of IKE and KRIBB11 would be toxic to more normal cells, we treated human mammary luminal epithelial cells (HMLE) and HMT\u20103522 S1 cells with these compounds. These cells are also immortalized but they approximate the normal cell state and are used as a point of comparison to transformed cells (Mani et\u00a0al, 2008; Rizki et\u00a0al, 2008). Neither of these cell lines exhibited a notable decrease in viability after 24\u00a0h of treatment (Fig\u00a04F and G). Similar results were obtained using RSL3 and KRIB11 (Fig\u00a0EV4 F and G). These findings suggest that normal cells are relatively insensitive to this therapy, a conclusion substantiated by the in\u00a0vivo data below.",
                        "We extended our analysis of the role of HSF1 in ferroptosis resistance to other cancer cell types. For this purpose, we used cell lines that are resistant to ferroptosis induced by GPX4\u00a0inhibition, including Hs578t cells, the glioblastoma cell line SF295, and the non\u2010small cell lung cancer cell line NCI H1975. We assessed whether KRIBB11 increased their sensitivity to either RSL3 or IKE. Indeed, the ability to resist RSL3\u2010 or IKE\u2010induced ferroptosis in all cell lines was significantly reduced when cells were co\u2010treated with RSL3 and KRIBB11, although neither treatment alone had a significant effect (Fig\u00a05A\u2013C).",
                        "Although many cancer cells are highly sensitive to drugs that induce ferroptosis (Hangauer\u00a0et\u00a0al, 2017; Viswanathan et\u00a0al, 2017), it is likely that such cells (and tumors) can acquire resistance to these drugs. To assess this possibility, we treated MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells with RSL3 for several weeks and were able to select for a population of cells that resisted this treatment. We then evaluated the ability of the parental, sensitive cells (MDA\u2010MB\u2010231S) and resistant (MDA\u2010MB\u2010231R) cells to survive treatment with RSL3 or IKE singly or in combination with KRIBB11 (Figs\u00a05D and E, and EV5A and B). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231S cells were unable to resist ferroptosis induced by IKE, either with or without KRIBB11, at concentrations as low as 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM. In contrast, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231R cells were able to survive in concentrations of IKE up to 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM. However, the combination of IKE with KRIBB11 was sufficient to overcome the resistance of the MDA\u2010MB\u2010231R cells to ferroptosis, consistent with the mechanism we have described."

Although these in\u00a0vitro data were compelling, it was important to assess the ability of this combinatorial approach to impede tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. For this purpose, we used Hs578t cells because they are resistant to ferroptosis (Brown et\u00a0al, 2019) including treatment with IKE (Fig\u00a05A). We implanted Hs578t cells in the mammary fat pads of NOD/SCID mice and monitored tumor formation over 21\u00a0days (Fig\u00a06A). Mice were randomized into treatment groups of vehicle (5% DMSO, 95% HBSS), IKE alone (23\u00a0mg/kg), or a combination of IKE and KRIBB11 (50\u00a0mg/kg) with daily intraperitoneal injections. During the treatment period, mice were weighed and assessed for tumor burden daily. Administration of IKE\u00a0+\u00a0KRIBB11 caused a significant decrease in tumor growth compared with either vehicle alone or IKE (Fig\u00a06B). IKE treatment alone did not impede tumor growth consistent with our finding that Hs578t cells are resistant to ferroptosis (Fig\u00a05A) (Brown et\u00a0al, 2019). Importantly, the combination of therapeutics did not adversely affect mouse weight, suggesting a low level of toxicity (Fig\u00a06C), in agreement with our observation that normal mammary epithelial cells were not affected by combined exposure to IKE and KRIBB11 in\u00a0vitro (Fig\u00a04F).",

While the increase in prominin2 staining was absent in IKE\u00a0+\u00a0KRIBB11 tumors, HSF1 staining increased in both IKE\u2010 and IKE\u00a0+\u00a0KRIBB11\u2010treated tumors (Fig\u00a06D), in agreement with the mechanism of action of prominin2 induction and ferroptosis resistance. Notably, 4HNE staining increased with IKE treatment but decreased with the combined treatment compared to the control, supporting the conclusion that IKE\u00a0+\u00a0KRIBB11 increases lipid peroxidation while KRIBB11 itself prevents the induction of prominin2."

We were able to exploit a finding that prominin2 has a key role in ferroptosis resistance by uncovering the mechanism by which it is induced in response to ferroptotic stress and develop a strategy to target this mechanism (Fig\u00a07). As a result, we found that the combined use of drugs that have the potential to induce ferroptosis with a drug that inhibits PROM2 transcription causes resistant cells to succumb to ferroptosis.",
                "We discovered that ferroptosis resistance is triggered by 4HNE, a lipid metabolite that is formed as an initial response to inhibition of either GPX4 or xCT. Interestingly, other lipid peroxidation products including MDA, 4ONE, and 4HHE were unable to induce prominin2 expression. Although this finding argues for the specificity of 4HNE in regulating prominin2, we cannot exclude the contribution of other lipid peroxidation products that were not evaluated. Nonetheless, the ability of resistant cells to activate p38 MAPK in response to 4HNE and promote activation of HSF1 that induces prominin2 expression indicates that cancer cells can exhibit a coordinated signaling response that protects them from ferroptosis.",
                "In recent years, there has been intense interest in developing drugs and approaches that stimulate ferroptosis in cancer as a therapeutic strategy. A key finding in this direction is that cancer cells with a more de\u2010differentiated, mesenchymal phenotype are dependent on GPX4 for their survival and, consequently, more sensitive to ferroptosis triggered by GPX4 inhibition than their more differentiated counterparts (Hangauer et\u00a0al, 2017; Viswanathan et\u00a0al, 2017). Nonetheless, many cancer cells including aggressive breast, glioblastoma, and lung cancer resist ferroptosis as we show in Fig\u00a05A\u2013C. Moreover, cells that are sensitive to GPX4 inhibition can acquire resistance and this resistance, as we have shown here, that can be undermined by inhibiting both GPX4 and HSF1 (Fig\u00a05D and E). For these reasons, our findings could have a significant impact on the approach to induction of ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy in cancer. This conclusion is supported by our finding that tumor xenografts that are resistant to IKE were sensitized to this compound by combined treatment with KRIBB11, presumably because inhibition of HSF1 and the consequent reduction in prominin2 expression enabled IKE to induce ferroptosis. It should be noted, however, that the ability of IKE to induce ferroptosis in\u00a0vivo has not been unequivocally demonstrated as it has in\u00a0vitro. Nonetheless, the data we present validate our hypothesis that targeting mechanisms that promote resistance to drugs, which have the potential to induce ferroptosis, is a viable therapeutic strategy."

Tumors were observable by palpation 21\u00a0days after injection. At 100\u00a0mm3, mice (8 mice/group) were separated randomly into groups for daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle control (5% DMSO/95% HBSS), 50\u00a0mg/kg KRIBB11, 23\u00a0mg/kg IKE, or IKE+KRIBB11. All solutions were sterilized by filtering through a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM syringe filter. Tumors were measured daily with electronic calipers, and volume was calculated by length (mm)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width (mm)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0width (mm). Mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation when tumor burden was more than 1,000\u00a0mm3 or percent weight loss was above 15%. Tumors were collected and frozen for immunocytochemistry. Tumor volume changes were analyzed in GraphPad Prism using two\u2010way ANOVA.
