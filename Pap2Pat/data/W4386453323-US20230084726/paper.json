    "date": "2023-09-05",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate quantum logic enhanced sensitivity for a macroscopic ensemble of solid-state, hybrid two-qubit sensors. We achieve over a factor of 30 improvement in the single-shot signal-to-noise ratio, translating to an ac magnetic field sensitivity enhancement exceeding an order of magnitude for time-averaged measurements. Using the electronic spins of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as sensors, we leverage the on-site nitrogen nuclear spins of the NV centers as memory qubits, in combination with homogeneous and stable bias and control fields, ensuring that all of the $ensuremath{sim}{10}^{9}$ two-qubit sensors are sufficiently identical to permit global control of the NV ensemble spin states. We find quantum logic sensitivity enhancement for multiple measurement protocols with varying optimal sensing intervals, including XY8 and DROID-60 dynamical decoupling, as well as correlation spectroscopy, using an applied ac magnetic field signal. The results are independent of the nature of the target signal and broadly applicable to measurements using NV centers and other solid-state spin ensembles. This work provides a benchmark for macroscopic ensembles of quantum sensors that employ quantum logic or quantum error correction algorithms for enhanced sensitivity.",

                "A clear transfer of polarization from the electronic sensor spins to the nuclear memory spins is observed when the SWAP operation is applied, with an estimated fidelity of 93%.",
                "After encoding the sensor spin population onto the memory spins using the SWAP gate, the electronic spin states are reset using an optical polarization pulse. With successive N applications of a CNOT e|n gate followed by an optical readout pulse, the information stored in the nuclear memory spins is then repeatedly mapped back onto the electronic spins and measured optically. This procedure provides many readouts within a duration limited by the nuclear spin lifetime T 1 , thereby enhancing the overall readout fidelity. The large number of NVs probed allows a high-precision ensemble average measurement of the sensor spin state with one execution of this repetitive readout protocol.",
                "Flip-flop transitions between the electronic and nuclear spins present the dominant T 1 relaxation channel, and are increasingly suppressed at higher bias magnetic fields. Using the pulse sequence shown in Fig. 2(c), we present measurements of T 1 in Fig. 2(d) for magnetic fields up to 4000 G, generated by a feedback-stabilized electromagnet [14]. At each magnetic field, the NV fluorescence signal contrast is measured as a function of optical pulse duration (T op ), which is applied after the SWAP operation and electronic spin reset, as described above, and before a single application of the CNOT e|n gate. The contrast decay curves are fit to a stretched exponential function to extract T 1 , with examples at the magnetic fields 200 G, 1700 G, and 3700 G shown in the inset of Fig. 2(d). The intensity of the laser pulse also affects the nuclear T 1 (see [20]), and is kept fixed. The T 1 values are fit to a power law function, yielding a power law exponent of 1.8(2) in agreement with an expected quadratic dependence [12]. The measurements presented in the remainder of this paper are performed at a bias magnetic field of 3700 G, with a corresponding 15 N nuclear spin T 1 of 3.44(12) ms.",
                "We apply the above repetitive readout technique to demonstrate quantum logic enhanced (QLE) AC magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of NV centers. We first use correlation spectroscopy to measure a three-tone test signal at about 1 MHz, generated by an RF synthesizer and communicated to the NV ensemble via a multiloop coil (see Fig. 1"

                        "Correlation spectroscopy is a popular NV T 1 -limited technique for AC magnetometry in which the time delay between two dynamical decoupling sequences (T corr ) is varied, see Fig. 3, with optical readout applied only after the second decoupling sequence [22][23][24][25][26]. Our correlation spectroscopy measurement employs two XY8-6 sequences [27,28]. As shown in Fig. 3, the sensing interval T sense is followed by a SWAP operation with duration T SWAP and N quantum logic readout cycles (each with duration T QLR ).",

The corresponding power spectrum, with the three tones well-resolved, is shown in Fig. 4(b), scaled up by a factor of 200. For the quantum logic enhanced (QLE) sensing protocol applied to measurements of the test signal, we determine a series of power spectra from the correlation time series acquired for each of the N readout cycles. As apparent in the inset of Fig. 4(c), the power spectrum signal amplitudes, A n , decay with increasing readout cycle index n due to 15 N nuclear spin T 1 relaxation. To optimize the signal-to-noise ratio SNR(N ) after N readouts [11], the signal amplitude for the n-th readout is weighted by",

                        "We normalize SNR(N ) by SNR(Ref), the SNR of the conventional NV electronic spin readout (without quantum logic), measured under the same experimental conditions. The SNR enhancement realized with quantum logic is shown in Fig. 4(c). For example, with 2000 QLR cycles, we achieve a 33.3(9)\u00d7 enhancement.",
                        "However, improvements in SNR do not necessarily translate into enhanced sensitivity, since SNR does not consider the impact on the measurement timescale (and hence bandwidth) of an extended readout interval. We first describe quantum logic sensitivity enhancement for AC magnetometry experiments using only a single dynamical decoupling sequence, and then address correlation spectroscopy experiments with varying T sense . For non-correlation spectroscopy experiments, A n corresponds to the maximum signal amplitude as the magnitude of a single-tone, 1 MHz test signal is varied.",
                        "Accounting for the overhead time associated with the SWAP operation (T SWAP = 16.5 \u00b5s) and each readout cycle (T QLR = 3 \u00b5s), the sensitivity enhancement obtained using the QLE protocol can be estimated from our measurements using,",

                        "As shown in Fig. 5(a) for an XY8:6 (six repetitions of an XY8) dynamical decoupling sequence with an opti- mal T sense = 24 \u00b5s, the quantum logic protocol achieves up to \u03b7 QLE = 2.4(3) for N \u2248 150, compared to the same sensing sequence with conventional readout. For the diamond sample used here, the optimal T sense under XY8 decoupling is constrained by the NV electronic spin coherence time T 2 \u2248 28 \u00b5s, which, in turn, is limited by NV-NV dipolar interactions [20].",
                        "To surpass this interaction limit, we employ the DROID-60 decoupling sequence introduced in Refs. [29,30] and thereby extend the optimal T sense to 144 \u00b5s [20]. As anticipated from Eq. ( 1), when the sensing duration becomes long compared to the additional overhead time for quantum logic readout, larger sensitivity enhancements are attained. From our measurements we find up to \u03b7 QLE = 5.6(3) for DROID-60:6 using quantum logic and N \u2248 400, compared to conventional readout, as shown in Fig. 5(a).",
                        "For AC magnetometry using the correlation spectroscopy sequence described earlier, T sense varies with T corr . To account for this dynamic T sense when acquiring correlation spectroscopy signals, we compare measurements using quantum logic with N readouts to con- ventional measurements repeated M times, where the total acquisition time for both experiments is equivalent. In Fig. 5(a), the number of conventional measurements M used to calculate the reference sensitivity for correlation spectroscopy scales with N to maintain: M \u00d7 (T sense + T QLR ) = T sense + T SWAP + (N \u00d7 T QLR ). For T corr ranging from 0 -1.5 ms in our experiments, we find a quantum logic sensitivity enhancement of up to \u03b7 QLE = 11.3(3) for N \u2248 1000. More intuitively, if we use the average value of T corr (0.75 ms) when calculating \u03b7 QLE via Eq. ( 1), we estimate a similar QLE sensitivity factor of \u03b7 QLE \u2248 11.",
                        "To highlight the versatility of the QLE technique, Fig. 5(b) provides estimates of quantum logic enhancement for a range of sensing durations T sense , given our experimental conditions. Applying an arbitrarily large amount of readouts is not favorable. In 5(b) \u03b7 QLE is reduced as N increases, most visible at T sense \u223c 200-600 \u00b5s for the ranges used in the plot. An improvement in sensitivity ( \u03b7 QLE > 1) is readily achieved when T sense exceeds T SWAP , applicable to a wide range of sensing sequences (and diamond materials) commonly used in NV-ensemble metrology and, in principle, for other solid-state spin systems.",
                        "In summary, we leveraged quantum logic using a macroscopic ensemble of solid-state, hybrid two-qubit sensors -each consisting of an NV electronic spin and the on-site 15 N nuclear spin in diamond -to realize a fac-tor of 30 improvement in spin state readout SNR, which in turn enables significant improvement in AC magnetic field sensitivity. The observed sensitivity enhancements can exceed an order of magnitude under favorable conditions (i.e, sensing interval \u223c 1 ms) using only global control of the NV ensemble.",
                        "Over a range of nitrogen doping concentrations (0.5-20 ppm), it is reasonable to tune the optimal sensing duration by decreasing the total nitrogen density in the material, which increases the NV electronic coherence time (T 2 ) proportionally [31], without impacting the photonshot-noise-limited sensitivity (assuming a constant N-NV conversion efficiency). For example, exchanging the sample used here ([N tot ] \u2248 14 ppm) for another with [N tot ] \u2248 0.8 ppm in future work, we anticipate an 18-fold increase in the optimal XY8 sensing duration, sufficient to provide an order-of-magnitude improvement in quantum logic enhanced sensitivity (QLE) for the conditions otherwise used in the present experiments.",
                        "Furthermore, the current approach is agnostic to the target signal and, therefore, broadly applicable to sensing a variety of physical quantities. In the context of NV ensemble magnetometry, the QLE protocol is naturally amenable to NMR spectroscopy given that both favor strong, uniform bias magnetic fields. Using a diamond with reduced [N] (and [NV]) to extend the NV ensemble coherence time, the QLE protocol provides a path towards order-of-magnitude improvements in the sensitivity of micron-scale NV-NMR with high spectral resolution [14]. Additionally, the improvements realized here are compatible with the growing collection of techniques for NV -NMR sample hyperpolarization [32,33].",
                        "Beyond magnetometry, NV-diamond dynamical decoupling protocols sensitive to crystal stress, pressure, and temperature have attained sensing durations of tens of microseconds or longer. For example, such sequences were recently employed in path-finding experiments for diamond-based dark matter searches [16]. With further development, the key metric of T sense > T SWAP may be realized for these alternative sensing applications, enabling quantum logic enhanced sensitivity.",
                        "Integrating additional quantum degrees of freedom, e.g., defects with couplings to multiple nuclear spins, is another promising direction for further progress in QLE sensing [34][35][36][37]. Similarly, solutions to address the random distribution of host lattice nuclear spins, such as manipulating the collective modes of a spin bath [38], may prove advantageous when exploring more advanced quantum logic or error correction algorithms [39] "

The AC signal is generated by applying a voltage to a test coil. The AC magnetic field from the test coil is first calibrated by measuring the signal amplitude (i.e., the NV contrast) as a function of applied voltage. The NV contrast undergoes periodic oscillations with increasing test signal voltage (red dots in the Fig. S1(a)). A single oscillation corresponds to 2\u03c0 phase accumulation by the NVs during the sensing sequence. The magnetic signal amplitude that produces 2\u03c0 phase accumulation is given by",

The AC sensitivity measurement for XY8 (green circles) and DROID-60 (purple circles) is shown in Fig. S1(b).

The best sensitivity is achieved for DROID-60:6 and XY8:6 for a sensing duration of 144 \u00b5s and 24 \u00b5s respectively. For longer sensing durations, the DROID-60 sequence outperforms the XY8 sequence.",
                "The improved AC sensitivity achieved with the DROID-60 is attributed to an extended NV electronic spin coherence time T 2 under DROID decoupling, as shown in Fig. S2 for both sequences. Under XY8 decoupling, the measured NV T 2 saturates at about 28 \u00b5s due to like-spin, NV-NV interactions (i.e., instantaneous diffusion) which are not decoupled by the XY8 sequence. Meanwhile, as previously demonstrated [2,3], the DROID-60 sequence does decouple such interactions, enabling increased T 2 with the application of additional decoupling cycles.

The NV ensemble T 2 decoherence time, measured using a Hahn-echo sequence, is 14.5 \u00b5s.

All four edges of the top face were then polished at 45 degrees (Delaware Diamond Knives), with a top face area of 1 mm \u00d7 1 mm. The [111] axis of the NV sensor is aligned parallel to the bias magnetic field. A variable bias magnetic field (0 G to 4000 G) is generated by a feedback-stabilized electromagnet. Details about the magnetic bias field stabilization is described in the Methods section of [1].",

For the experiments in this work, the duration of each optical pulse is 3 \u00b5s. The NV spin-state-dependent fluorescence is read out after 1 \u00b5s, followed by additional optical re-initialization of the NV electronic spin for 2 \u00b5s. The NV fluorescence signal is collected by a liquid light guide (Thorlabs LLG5-8H) and delivered to a photodetector (Thorlabs PDB210A). An arbitrary waveform generator (Tektronix AWG7122C) generates microwave (MW) pulses with a temporal resolution of 12 Giga-samples per second (83 ps). The pulses are amplified using a microwave amplifier (Minicircuits ZHL-25W-63+, RF Lambda RFLUPA0618GD). The radiofrequency (RF) pulses (1-3 MHz), used to apply the cNOT operation on the nuclear spin, conditioned on the electronic spin state, are generated by a function generator (Rigol DG1032). Both the MW and the RF control pulses are combined using a power splitter (Minicircuits ZN2PD2-14W-S+). The combined signal is delivered to the NV diamond, to drive the NV electronic spins and the 15 N nuclear spins, through a single loop shorted coil of 1 mm diameter. A synthetic AC magnetic signal (1 MHz) is generated by applying an AC voltage (Rigol DG1022) to a home-built multi loop test coil (4 loops, 10 mm diameter). While Fig. S3 suggests it would be ideal to work at lower laser power (for a fixed illumination area), since the nuclear spin lifetime is longer at lower laser powers, the effect of increased re-polarization optical pulse durations at lower laser power must also be considered. For QLE sensing, the performance of the technique is maximized by accommodating more readout pulses. This can be achieved by reducing the duration of each readout/re-initialization pulse. To balance these two factors, we choose to work at a laser power of 130 mW where the \u223c75% NV spins are re-polarized within 3 \u00b5s."
