The electronic device 100 also includes a speaker 130, a main processor 140, an input/output (I/O) interface (IF) 145, a touchscreen 150, a display 3155, and a memory 160.

The RF transceiver 110 down-converts the incoming RF signal to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal. The IF or baseband signal is sent to the RX processing circuitry 125, which generates a processed baseband signal by filtering, decoding, and/or digitizing the baseband or IF signal. The RX processing circuitry 125 transmits the processed baseband signal to the speaker 130 (such as for voice data) or to the main processor 140 for further processing (such as for web browsing data).",

The TX processing circuitry 115 encodes, multiplexes, and/or digitizes the outgoing baseband data to generate a processed baseband or IF signal. The RF transceiver 110 receives the outgoing processed baseband or IF signal from the TX processing circuitry 115 and up-converts the baseband or IF signal to an RF signal that is transmitted via the antenna 105. According to certain embodiments, TX processing circuitry and RX processing circuitry encode and decode data and signaling for wireless in resource blocks (\u201cRBs\u201d or physical resource blocks \u201cPRBs\u201d) which are transmitted and received by, inter alia, the base stations of a wireless network.

While server 200 has been described with reference to a standalone device, embodiments according to this disclosure are not so limited, and server 200 could also be embodied in whole, or in part, on a cloud or virtualized computing platform. Additionally, in some embodiments, server 200 may be embodied across multiple computing platforms.",
                        "FIG. 3 illustrates a non-limiting example of a network context 300 in which systems and methods for bid optimization for real-time bidding according to embodiments of this disclosure may be implemented. While network context 300 is described with reference to a network context for real time bidding for digital advertisement impressions, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Rather, the principles described with reference to FIG. 3 may be implemented in any number of contexts in which a networked apparatus (for example, 200) needs, in real-time, to generate an allocation of a finite set of first resources to an iterative series of contests for second resources, wherein incorrect allocations of resources equate to contest losses and an inefficient excess of allocation signaling. Put differently, having to transmit 10 bids to win one contest when five better-calculated bids would have won one contest is, from a system and network performance perspective, inefficient and slow. Accordingly, embodiments according to the present disclosure improve the performance of a processing platform as a tool for participating in real-time contests for contentious resources by reducing the number of bid submissions that need to be sent across a network to obtain an optimum resource allocation.",
                        "Referring to the example shown in FIG. 3, network context 300 comprises one or more electronic devices 301 (for example, instances of electronic device 100 in FIG. 1) executing at least one application (for example, a gaming application, or a web browser application) which hosts and provides a space for presenting ad impressions (for example, advertising content presented in a persistent header of a web page). Whereas in-app advertising space has historically been sold in advance, there has been a shift in the industry towards real-time bidding for advertisement impressions, wherein the interval between a visitor landing on a screen containing an advertisement space, and an advertiser's purchase of the advertisement space may be less than a second. That is, advertisers can (and do) bid in real-time for advertisement impressions presented at electronic device 301.",
                        "According to various embodiments, electronic device 301 is connected to one or more supply side platforms (SSP) 305a through 305n, which comprise computing platforms (for example, one or more instances of server 200 in FIG. 2 or cloud computing platforms equivalent thereto) which host advertisement content and respond to calls (for example, a call associated with a request for page content associated with a page visited by a web browser) for ad content. According to various embodiments, first SSP 305a may be a first party ad server or a third-party ad server.",
                        "As shown in the illustrative example of FIG. 3, SSPs 305a-305n are communicatively connected to a real-time-bidding (RTB) ad exchange 310 (for example, a Sharethrough). According to various embodiments, ad exchange 310 comprises one or more instances of a computing platform (for example, server 200 in FIG. 2 or cloud computing platforms equivalent thereto) communicatively connected to SSPs 305a -305n and demand side platforms (DSPs) 315a -315n. Ad exchange 310 is configured to real-time auctions for advertisement impressions, wherein each DSP of DSPs 315a-315n programmatically generates and submits bid values for ad impressions on electronic device 301. In many instances, electronic device 301 belongs to a grouped cohort of electronic devices to which ad impressions will be served. As shown in FIG. 3, a DSP may be communicatively connected to a data management platform (DMP) 320, which in some embodiments, is a server at which historical data regarding past auctions may be stored and made available for one or more DSPs to use in generating bids. According to various embodiments, the performance of each DSP of DSPs 315a-315n depends significantly on the extent to which the DSP can generate optimized bid values. Where a DSP fails to consistently generate and submit bids at prices that: a.) maximize one or more metrics of interest (for example, total number of clicks on ad impressions, or return on advertisement spend); and b.) suffice to win auctions by thin margins, the performance of the DSP, both as a pricing tool, and a networked computing system is degraded. Put differently, where a DSP cannot reliably win auctions by thin margin, it needs to submit more bids over a network to ad exchange 310, resulting in unnecessary network traffic and system latency, as an unoptimized DSP is not capable of placing advertisements as quickly as a system which can reliably generate bids which win auctions by thin margins.",
                        "According to various embodiments, nth DSP 315n is communicatively connected to one or more processing platforms 325 (for example, instances of electronic device 100 in FIG. 1 or server 200 in FIG. 2) running an instance of DSP administrator application, through which one or more connected DSPs may be configured. In some embodiments, the DSP administrator application provides a UI through which DSP parameters can be specified, including, but not limited to, a key performance indicator (KPI) to be optimized, whether to enable consideration of user response uncertainty, whether or how to model risk tendency, one or more bidding strategies to be implemented, and whether to implement bid shading.",
