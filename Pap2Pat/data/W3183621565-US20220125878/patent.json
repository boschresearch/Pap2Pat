Despite unprecedented worldwide effort, COVID-19 remains a pandemic with global deaths approaching 1 million.1 While the majority of the infected individuals are asymptomatic, symptomatic patients have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome to extrapulmonary injuries to the heart, kidney, liver, and other organs. Multiorgan involvement is an important risk factor for severity and mortality.",
                        "SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA member of the Betacoronavirus genus known to infect humans. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the sole known receptor mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells2,3 ACE2 expression has been found on alveolar epithelial type II cells of the lung and on nasal epithelial cells, renal tubular cells, and intestinal epithelial cells4, which is thought to contribute to virus-mediated injury of these organs. Up to 71.4% of critically ill COVID-19 patients have thrombosis and coagulopathy, often associated with poor prognosis.5,6 Multiple studies, including a multicenter prospective cohort study, indicate that coagulopathy and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients are characterized by increased plasma levels of D-dimer (fibrin degradation product), von Willebrand factor (VWF), and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII)7,8, which is thought to be caused by SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses or sepsis.2,7,8 Markers of endothelial activation such as elevated levels of soluble P-selectin, CD40L, and thrombomodulin have been documented in the plasma of patients with severe COVID-197. However, recent single-cell RNA sequence studies have demonstrated little or no expression of ACE2 in vascular endothelial cells4,9. These findings have left unresolved whether direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells contributes to coagulopathy and thrombosis.5,7,8",

Typically, the dose range of the anti-L-SIGN antibody, a mannan, or a recombinant L-SIGN/Fc protein therapeutic agent is administered from about 0.5 to 1000 \u03bcg/kg, or 1 to 500 \u03bcg/kg, or 10 to 500 \u03bcg/kg, or 50 to 100 \u03bcg/kg of the patient's body weight per dose. The dose of a therapeutic anti-L-SIGN antibody, a mannan, or a recombinant L-SIGN/Fc protein can be administered to the patient intravenously or intraarterially as either a bolus dose or by infusion from about 0.1 to 100 \u03bcg/kg of the patient's body weight, or 0.3 to 30 \u03bcg/kg, or 1 to 3 \u03bcg/kg of the patient's body weight per dose. To achieve localized targeted dosing, anti-L-SIGN antibody, a mannan, or a recombinant L-SIGN/Fc protein can be injected either directly into or adjacent to the tissue damage or tissue injury by decreasing endothelial cell death in the liver or lymph node, preferably either into or as near as practical to the region of viral damage. Localized dose ranges can be from 10 ng/cm3 to 1 mg/cm3, or 100 ug/cm3 to 100 ug/cm3 or 1 ug/cm3 to 10 ug/cm3 of target tissue damage or tissue injury by decreasing endothelial cell death in the liver or lymph node per dose. Local doses can be administered the liver or lymph node(s), or upstream thereof, in the case of the liver intravenously and in the case of lymph nodes into one or more lymphatic drainage area(s). The dosage may be a single one or a series of two or more given in the course of one or more days, as is needed by the patient. Where no human dosage is established, a suitable human dosage can be inferred from ED50 or ID50 values, or other appropriate values derived from in vitro or in vivo studies, as qualified by toxicity studies and efficacy studies in animals.",

                        "The present inventors determined that SARS-CoV-2 is related to SARS-CoV (\u02dc80% sequence identity), which was the coronavirus that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV, in addition to interact with ACE2, binds to liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN, also known as CD209L, CD299 or CLEC4M), which mediates virus entry into host cells. L-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor that mediates cell adhesion or pathogen recognition by Ca2+-dependent binding to glycans. Whether SARS-CoV-2 uses L-SIGN to infect host cells is unknown. The inventors found that L-SIGN bound to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a high-mannose N-glycan- and Ca2+-dependent manner. L-SIGN was detected at high levels on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) of lymph nodes from human biopsy or autopsy samples. LSECs and LECs are major sources of procoagulant proteins such as FVIII and VWF. The inventors also found that increased expression of VWF and FVIII in LSECs of COVID-19 patient liver samples. This study reveals a SARS-CoV-2 receptor on endothelial cells contributes to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy.",

                        "Ca2+-dependent binding of L-SIGN to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates viral entry. The extracellular domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is modified by N-linked glycans (FIG. 1A)10, 11. L-SIGN has a Glu-Pro-Asn (EPN) motif in its extracellular domain that recognizes mannose moieties (FIG. 1A, FIG. 11)19, 20. The inventors generated a recombinant protein with the RBD (residue 333-529 amino acids) of the spike protein fused to a human IgG2 Fc (Spike/Fc, FIG. 1B). The inventors also established HEK293T cell lines expressing L-SIGN-flag or ACE2-myc3 as positive controls (FIG. 1C)2. Spike/Fc bound to L-SIGN- and ACE2-expressing cells in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing Ca2+(FIG. 1D). The Ca2+ chelator EGTA blocked the interaction of spike/Fc with L-SIGN but not with ACE220, indicating that binding to L-SIGN is Ca2+ dependent. To validate that L-SIGN is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the inventors generated SARS-CoV-2-type pseudo-typed virus (CoV2-type) (FIG. 2G, 2H)2. The inventors found that CoV2-type specifically infected cells expressing ACE2 or L-SIGN (FIG. 1E, 1F). In addition, CoV2-type preferentially infected cells with higher levels of L-SIGN expression (FIG. 1G). In comparison, the control VSVG-type pseudo-typed virus (VSVG-type) non-specifically infected HEK293T cells (FIG. 1E, 1F).",

However, Spike/Fc binding to and CoV2-type infection of DC-SIGN-expressing cells were much lower than for L-SIGN-expressing cells (FIG. 1C-1F).",
                        "L-SIGN has two distinct internalization motifs in its cytosolic domain. One is a di-leucine and the other is a tri-acidic cluster21. Mutagenesis of the di-leucine or the tri-acidic cluster to alanine did not affect efficiency of CoV2-type infection; however, combined mutagenesis of these two motifs significantly decreased CoV2-type infection, supporting a role of L-SIGN as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection (FIG. 1H, FIG. 2I-K).",
                        "L-SIGN binds to a high-mannose N-glycan on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The RBD sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has an N-glycosylation site at Asn34310, 11 with unknown function (FIG. 1A). The inventors analyzed the glycan structures of Spike/Fc and found that high-mannose type N-glycans were frequent (FIG. 2A, FIG. 6A, 6B)22, which was confirmed by their removal with the high-mannose-specific endoglycosidase H (FIG. 6C). To determine whether a high-mannose N-glycan is the determinant of L-SIGN binding, the inventors first generated an N-glycan-deficient Spike/Fc in which Asn343 was replaced with glutamine (Q) (SpikeN343Q/Fc, FIG. 2B, left). Mannose moieties on Spike/Fc and their deficiency on SpikeN343Q/Fc were demonstrated by mannose-specific lectin GNL blotting (FIG. 2B, right). SpikeN343Q/Fc bound to cells expressing ACE2 but not to cells expressing L-SIGN, indicating that L-SIGN recognizes an N-glycan structure on N343 (FIG. 2C). To examine if the EPN motif of L-SIGN is involved in N-glycan recognition on Spike/Fc, the inventors substituted the EPN sequence with alanines (L-SIGNAAA) or with Gln-Pro-Asp (QPD), a galactose recognition motif (L-SIGNQPD)23. Spike/Fc binding to and CoV2-type infection of cells expressing either L-SIGN mutant were abolished (FIG. 2D, 2E).",
                        "To further investigate if a high-mannose N-glycan on Spike/Fc is critical for L-SIGN binding, the inventors expressed wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of the extracellular domain of L-SIGN (residue 78-399 amino acids) fused to the human IgG2 Fc domain (L-SIGN/Fc, FIG. 7A). L-SIGN/Fc but not L-SIGNQPD/Fc bound to spike protein-expressing HEK293T cells. Binding was inhibited by EGTA and by mannan, a \u03b2-mannose polymer that blocks interactions with high-mannose N-glycans (FIG. 2F)24. The inventors also treated spike protein-expressing cells with kifunensine, a small molecule that promotes accumulation of high-mannose type N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (FIG. 7B)25. Kifunensine treatment enhanced the binding of spike protein to either L-SIGN/Fc or GNL (FIG. 7C). These data indicate that the EPN motif of L-SIGN recognizes a high-mannose type N-glycan on spike protein in a Ca2+-dependent manner (FIG. 7D).",

Only humans and great apes have genes that encode L-SIGN (FIG. 1J)26. To explore the biological function of interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and L-SIGN, the inventors first profiled the expression of L-SIGN in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal human biopsy as well as autopsy tissue samples27. After antigen retrieval, L-SIGN was detected in LSECs and in LECs in the lymph node with both immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining with two different antibodies (Origene #TA810067 and #TA810055) to human L-SIGN (FIG. 3A, 3B). L-SIGN was not detected in other blood vessels such as central vein, portal vein, hepatic artery in the liver or high endothelial venules and arterioles in the lymph nodes. It was also not detected in airway epithelial cells and other cells in the lung or in LECs in other tissues such as intestine, heart, and kidney (FIGS. 8 and 9). Of note, the inventors did not detect ACE2 in LSECs and in lymph node LECs based on immunostaining with two different antibodies (Abcam #ab89111, R&D #AF933) (FIG. 10A). Thus, these data demonstrate that L-SIGN, but not ACE2, is uniquely expressed on LSECs and on LECs in the lymph node.",

Neither receptor was detected on immortalized human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a hybrid endothelial cell line EAhy926, or immortalized human dermal microvascular blood endothelial cells (DMECs). A previous mRNA microarray study reported L-SIGN mRNA induction in human endothelial cells upon stimulation with TNF\u03b1 or IL-428. However, the inventors did not detect L-SIGN expression in human endothelial cell lines after TNF\u03b1 or IL-4 challenges (FIG. 11A, 11B). Furthermore, these cells were not susceptible to CoV2-type infection (FIG. 11C, 11D).

Moreover, TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, cytokines elevated in COVID-19 patients, did not stimulate the expression of L-SIGN in these cells (FIG. 11F).

                        "LSECs of COVID-19 patient liver autopsy samples have detectable SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit increased procoagulant activities. To determine the clinical significance of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and L-SIGN, the inventors first examined if SARS-CoV-2 was present in LSECs of COVID-19 patients' formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver autopsy samples. In comparison with uninfected human liver autopsy samples, the inventors found increased expression of L-SIGN and detected SARS-CoV-2 with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (Invitrogen #MA1-7404) in patient LSECs (FIG. 4A). Importantly, significantly increased expression of VWF was detected in the patient LSECs relative to that of uninfected controls (FIG. 4B-4D)7, 16, 17. In addition, expression of FVIII in the patient LSECs relative to that of uninfected controls showed an increased trend even though it was not statistically significant (FIG. 4C, 4D). Co-expression of CLEC4M (encoding L-SIGN) with VWF, F8, and PLAT (encoding key coagulation factors VWF, FVIII, and t-PA) in LSECs was validated by analyzing published single-cell RNA sequencing data from human liver (FIG. 10B)30. Interestingly, Lyve1, a marker for LSECs, was barely detectable in the patient LSECs relative to those of the uninfected controls (FIG. 4E).",

The inventors treated L-SIGN-expressing HEK293T cells with an antibody to human L-SIGN (anti-L-SIGN, R&D #MAB162), with mannan to block mannose-dependent interactions, or with L-SIGN/Fc recombinant protein. As negative controls, the inventors used isotype-matched control IgG and Fc control protein. Anti-L-SIGN, mannan, or L-SIGN/Fc recombinant protein dose-dependently blocked L-SIGN-mediated CoV2-type infection but not control VSVG-type infection, indicating specific inhibition of L-SIGN-mediated CoV2 infection. CoV2-type infection was not blocked by negative controls (FIGS. 5A, 5B, and FIGS. 7E, 7F). These data demonstrate that infection requires interactions of a mannose glycan on the CoV2-type spike protein with L-SIGN.",

                        "L-SIGN is a type II transmembrane protein. The phylogenetic tree suggests that gene duplication of DC-SIGN in the Old World monkey has given rise to L-SIGN (FIG. 1J)26. Only humans and great apes such as gorilla and chimpanzee express L-SIGN (FIG. 1I, 1J). L-SIGN and DC-SIGN are C-type lectin receptors that mediate infections of Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, HIV-1, and hepatitis C virus via interactions with viral envelope glycoproteins. SARS-CoV-2 is related to SARS-CoV, which caused the first coronavirus epidemic in 200331. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar spike proteins. Although the SARS-CoV spike protein binds to both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, only L-SIGN binding initiates SARS-CoV infection32. L-SIGN binds to the N-glycosylated N-terminus but not to the RBD of the SARS-CoV spike protein. Mutagenesis of N330 in the RBD of SARS-CoV, equivalent to N343 of SARS-CoV-2, does not affect SARS-CoV infection (FIG. 6D)33. In contrast, the data herein demonstrates that L-SIGN must bind to a high-mannose N-glycan on the spike protein to mediate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells. The molecular basis of the difference in the L-SIGN recognition domain of spike protein between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 remains to be studied31.",
                        "Previous studies of N-glycans on RBD N343 yielded discrepant results, probably due to different expression systems used to produce recombinant spike protein for glycan profiling10, 11. The inventors' structural analysis indicates that high-mannose N-glycans are common on the spike protein, and the functional assays show that the high-mannose N-glycan is critical for binding to L-SIGN but not to ACE2 (FIG. 2C).",

In human lungs, ACE2 is expressed on alveolar epithelial type II cells, which mediates virus entry and replication that causes acute alveolar epithelial cell injury4. Other than the lung, ACE2 is also found in the kidney, small intestine, and heart, which possibly contributes to pathologies in these organs36. Coagulopathy and thrombosis are common complications of patients with severe COVID-195, 7. Although the causes of coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 are almost certainly multifaceted, including inflammatory responses37, 38, previous studies have demonstrated a role for endothelial cell injury or dysfunction39. However, there is no convincing evidence that ACE2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells39, 40. As shown herein, ACE2 was not detected in vascular endothelial cells in different human tissues or in multiple human endothelial cell lines from different origins.",
                        "Markers of endothelial cell activation such as increased circulating VWF and FVIII have been observed in severe COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units, which is correlated with mortality7. During severe inflammation, many factors contribute to endothelial cell activation. These data show that interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with L-SIGN on LSECs can directly mediate endothelial injury. Notably, considerably higher levels of L-SIGN on LSECs were detected in liver from patients with COVID-19 than from uninfected controls (FIG. 4A-4C). The COVID-19 patient LSECs lost expression of Lyve-1, a sign of liver inflammation, but exhibited procoagulant activities, suggesting endothelial dysfunction (FIG. 4E)7, 41. LSECs, together with lymph node LECs, are primary sources of FVIII16, 18, which pairs with VWF as essential procoagulants16. Coagulation changes in the most severe COVID-19 patients are different from typical sepsis-related disseminated intravascular coagulopathy because of less prominent thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy, suggestive of an unappreciated mechanism7. In addition, hyperfibrinolysis (increased D-dimer levels) was prominent in COVID-patients. The inventors found that other than VWF and FVIII, t-PA is also highly expressed in LSECs (FIG. 10B). Activated endothelial cells release t-PA42, which could cause the burst of plasmin and subsequent increased D-dimer in COVID-19 patients. Enlarged livers have been noted in COVID-19 patients43. LSECs comprise a significant portion of non-parenchymal cells in the liver, the largest solid organ in humans44. L-SIGN-mediated activation of VWF- and FVIII-enriched LSECs may be critical to the pathogenesis of coagulopathy and thrombosis in severe COVID-19 patients7.",
                        "Multiple animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported, ranging from rodents to Old World and New World monkeys34, 35, 45, 46, 47. These animal models display consistent pulmonary inflammatory changes, but none exhibits obvious signs of coagulopathy or thrombosis. This may be explained by the fact that L-SIGN is not expressed in these non-human primates. Other experimental models are needed to identify additional unappreciated factors contribute to COVID-19-related coagulopathy in humans. Based on these results, it is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 infection of LSECs and LECs through L-SIGN leads to endothelial cell activation and secretion of VWF and FVIII into circulation, which may synergize with ACE2-mediated infection to cause coagulopathy in humans16, 26, 48. Indeed, ligand-engagement of L-SIGN is known to trigger mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades49, 50. These data also indicate that caution needs to be taken in extrapolating results from animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the human disease.",
                        "Expression of L-SIGN in other tissues or other types of vascular endothelial cells may also contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, other than LSECs in the liver and LECs in the lymph node, the inventors did not detect L-SIGN expression in other organs and in vascular endothelium of many types of human tissues, including the lung, despite utilizing two different immunostaining methods, multiple approaches for antigen retrieval, and two independent anti-human L-SIGN antibodies that recognize different epitopes. In addition, the inventors did not detect CoV2-type infection in immortalized HUVECs and DMECs (FIGS. 11A-11G). Therefore, these results do not support L-SIGN as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in other tissues or on blood endothelial cells in other organs.",
                        "In summary, the present inventors identified L-SIGN as a new, tissue-specific receptor for SARS-CoV-2. By way of explanation, and in no way a limitational of the present invention, these results provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 patients. Importantly, it was found that interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and L-SIGN could be blocked by anti-L-SIGN antibody, by mannan, or by recombinant L-SIGN/Fc protein. These results provide a novel therapeutic option to treat severe COVID-19 infection in general, and viral or virally-induced tissue dysfunction or failure such as tissue damage or tissue injury by decreasing endothelial cell death in the liver or lymph node.",
