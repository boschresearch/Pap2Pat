                                "Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, refers to processes used to create 3D objects by the successive layering of material under computer control. AM technologies are widely used in the automotive, aerospace, military, dental, and medical industries. While there have been tremendous developments in AM, the 3D printing of optics is lagging due to its unique requirements. Although a number of commercially sold 3D printers can print transparent components, post processing that is typically needed to create smooth surfaces cannot control the surface shape and surface roughness to a sufficient degree. None of these commercially sold 3D printers can truly print optical elements with good surface quality for imaging applications.",
                                "Freeform optics is a recent, emerging field being developed to meet the increasing demands created by the high performance and ultra-compact optical imaging systems critical to consumer and medical applications, such as mobile phones, head mounted displays, and ultrathin endoscopes. When compared to traditional optics, freeform optics offer a number of advantages; however, a precision freeform optical element is much more complicated to fabricate and test than a traditional optical element. Ultra-precision single point diamond turning is capable of producing high quality surface finishes on the order of nanometers, while meeting tight form tolerances on the order of micrometers. However, it is a very time-consuming process and the prototyping cost is high. Fabrication is one of the major issues preventing freeform optics from realizing rapid commercial adoption, with current options incapable of complex freeform optics or prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.",
                                "Prior art systems for 3D printing of transparent material include the \u201cprintoptical\u201d technology by Luxexcel Group B. V., stereolithography (SLA), multi-jet modeling (MJM), and polyjet printing. Recently Nanoscribe GmbH has developed a new technique for printing micro-optical elements using a two-photon technique.",
                                "SLA uses a photopolymer resin cured by an ultraviolet (UV) light. The photopolymer is solidified layer-by-layer to create a product. Due to the curing process used, visible layers remain in the product. MJM uses a jetting technology and a wax support material, with a product printed layer-by-layer and the support material is then melted away. Polyjet 3D printing can work with a wide range of materials: layers of liquid photopolymer are layered and cured using UV light, with the capability to form complex geometries. All three techniques and the commercial systems, however, were developed to print non-transparent components. Although post-processing like sanding and grit blastering can increase transparency, the surface roughness exceeds the demands of optical applications and, most importantly, the surface shape after post-processing cannot be controlled.",
                                "Nanoscribe's Photonic Professional GT uses multiphoton polymerization with direct laser writing, and was developed to produce complex photonics structure\u2014rather than optical imaging. Its major problem for printing optical components is the small field of view of the scanning microscope objective, which means only very small optics can be realized. For optics larger than a few hundred microns, the gaps between the field of view may be obvious and unsuitable for imaging applications.",
                                "Luxexcel's proprietary \u201cprintoptical\u201d technology can 3D print transparent products without visible layering using a UV-curable acrylic. Droplets are jetted and merged before being cured. This is the only printing technique that can manufacture regular-size optical elements. Due to the relatively large surface shape error and low surface quality, however, the printed optical elements are not suitable for imaging applications and are mostly used for illumination.",
                                "All of the above commercial systems use UV curing, either through a standard UV polymerization process or two-photon polymerization process. One limitation of the current UV curing systems is the resultant lens material appears yellowish.",
                                "Optical silicone is one material which is typically used in LED lighting and other applications. Compared to UV curable materials, it has a number of advantages: strong UV stability, non-yellowing, and high transmission. Optical silicone is particularly suitable for optical imaging applications. A number of methods have been reported to fabricate optics using optical silicones, including lithographic methods, surface tension driven methods, embossing methods, hanging methods, and confined sessile drop technique. However those methods have some common issues: (1) they are limited to simple, small scale optics; (2) they are relatively slow; and (3) they cannot control the freeform shape to meet the specifications. A moving needle method was developed to partially change the lens shape, but it cannot control the lens shape accurately. Printing using a passive droplet dispenser has been investigated to fabricate lenses from optical silicone as well, but the reported method cannot control the lens shape adequately.",
                                "The major limitation of the reported methods in fabricating optics from optical silicone is that there is no effective method to control the lens shape. The lens shape relies on the formation of liquid droplets, which is the interplay of viscous drag, surface tension, capillary forces and gravitational forces. Another limitation is that as the entire optics is heated to solidify the component after the shape is formed, it is a time consuming process which may also introduce errors when the optics is large.",
                                "Therefore, there is a need for improved techniques for additive manufacturing of optics, including techniques of additive freeform optics manufacturing (AFOM), which can fabricate freeform optics rapidly, accurately, and efficiently."

The inventors have determined that getting heat into the optical material quickly is critical to solidifying the material quickly and reducing cycle times. Instead of curing the entire optical element using oven or other heating methods, an ultrafast IR laser is used to locally solidify the optical materials to control the lens shape accurately. Ultrafast laser radiation can offer advantages in processing the material, due to the high peak intensity achieved in the focal region which allows for curing of optical material and the brief duration of the laser-material interaction can potentially offer a negligible heat-affected zone. Aspects of the present invention are capable of forming freeform optics and other complex optics that are inaccessible with conventional processes.",

Descriptions of well-known structures are omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the invention in detail. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific example, while indicating aspects of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, and are not by way of limitation.

                        "Referring first to FIG. 1, there is shown a schematic diagram of the proposed AM process. After a lens is designed, it is imported to the modeling software from the optical design software. The modeling software will analyze the design and the specifications, and then layout the printing process to achieve a lens of a defined final shape and defined intermediate shapes. The printing process will instruct the dispenser to distribute an appropriate amount of materials to a substrate located on a stage. The focused IR laser beam is used to heat and solidify the material locally to the defined shape. Deposition location and cure location may be facilitated by moving the print head relative to the stage.",
                        "In some embodiments, in situ metrology will measure a cured surface in real time and provide feedback to the printing process. If there is deviation from a defined intermediate shape, the printing process will be fine-tuned to compensate for the deviation. This is a recurrent process until the lens meets the specifications. If the final measurement result (e.g., lens shape or surface roughness) still does not meet the specifications, an ultrafast IR laser may be applied to locally modify the surface shape and roughness.",
                        "Key advantages of the proposed techniques include: (1) accurate fabrication of complex freeform optics with high surface quality; (2) ability to print in three printing modes (layer-by-layer, drop-on-demand, and lithographic modes); and (3) lenses are typically strong UV stabile, non-yellowing, and high transmission.",
                        "Turning now to FIG. 2, there is shown a block diagram showing the elements of an example of an embodiment of a printing system 100 according to aspects of the present invention. The system 100 comprises a material dispenser 102 to deposit material (i.e., thermal curable material) constituting the optic to be produced, an IR laser 104 to cure the material, and a stage 110 or other means to produce relative movement between the dispenser 102 and/or the laser 104, and the lens to be produced. For example, a stage 110 may be configured to move the product while it is being produced to control the location at which the material is dispensed and the locations at which the material is cured. Optionally, a metrology apparatus 106 to measure the product while it is being produced and/or after it is produced may be included.",

The processor 108 also controls deposition and curing of the material. The processor 108 may be additionally coupled to the metrology apparatus 106 to measure a product during manufacture. Optionally, as described in greater detail below, a system 100 may comprise a modeling and control software module to compare the measured results to the design target, and modify the deposition (e.g., amount and location of material) and/or curing process (e.g., the laser parameters) to achieve the design target.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown an example of a process for fabricating a lens from thermally curable optical material according to aspects of the present invention in which material is deposited to form a layer which is cured by radiation from an ultrafast IR laser. At the first step, shown in image (a) of FIG. 3, the material is dropped on the substrate. The amount or volume of the material deposited on the substrate depends on the desired thickness of the layer and lens size. After the material flows uniformly over the substrate or on the solidified lens surface to form a layer of cured material as shown in image (a) or image (c) of FIG. 3, the focused, ultrafast laser beam will solidify the material in high speed to form the shape of each layer (shown in image (b) and image (c) of FIG. 3). By repeating the steps shown in image (a) and image (b) of FIG. 3, it is possible to form the lens shape as shown in image (d) of FIG. 3. The unsolidified material is spun off or cleaned using another approach.",
                        "Due to the layer-by-layer curing process, steps between each layer may be formed (as shown in image (d) of FIG. 3). To smooth the lens surface, a relatively large amount of material may be applied to the lens surface to fill the steps between each layer (as shown in image (e) of FIG. 3). The amount or volume of material applied to the lens surface is large relative to the quantity of material deposited on the substrate to form the lens layers. The applied material is then cured, for example, with pulsed or continuous wave IR laser (shown in image (f) of FIG. 3). One example of a material to be used is thermal curable silicone (e.g., MS-1002 available from Dow Corning). Another option for smoothing between the layers is applying a quantity of material over the entirety or a portion of the outer surface of layered lens and heating the quantity of material to cure it. Depending on factors such as the material and the thickness of the layer, the quantity of material can be cured by heat of temperatures within the range of 150\u00b0 C.-500\u00b0 C. The heat can be applied by heat from surrounding air or by placing the lens in a bath of suitably hot water to cure the quantity of material.",
                        "Although a system using a focused beam was described above, it is to be appreciated that rather than a focused (i.e., point-by-point) curing process, the pulsed laser light may be projected (i.e., using a projector lens system) over an entire layer (or a fraction of a layer) such that the entire layer (or the fraction of a layer) is cured using one or more pulses. Also, although the above techniques use deposition of a layer or drop-on-demand prior to curing, it is also possible to provide a tank of liquid material (e.g., silicone) and to cure a layer of the liquid material (e.g., silicone) in a point-by-point or projection manner to produce the layers of a lens.",
                        "Turning now to FIG. 4, there are shown examples of printed lenses printed with a system according to aspects of the preset invention using Dow Corning Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer. Image (a) of FIG. 4 illustrates a simple plano-convex lens. Image 4(b) illustrates a plano-concave lens (FIG. 4(b)). Image (c) illustrates an example of a freeform lens (i.e., a donut lens).
