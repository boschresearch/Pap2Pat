                        "Road traffic safety continues to play a major role in the overall health of the world's population. Today, road traffic accidents are the eighth leading cause of death for people of all ages, annually amounting to approximately 1.35 million fatalities worldwide. Continuing to strive for improved road traffic safety is therefore in the interest of all stakeholders in road traffic systems. Visions of reducing the number of road fatalities towards zero have been put forward by numerous countries, states, counties, and cities. However, recent data suggests that the number of fatalities and injuries on European as well as on U.S. roads has started to level out or even increase.",
                        "From a vehicle design point of view, a long tradition of improvements has been seen related to crash safety, i.e. injury prevention in the case of a crash occurring. More recently, automated collision avoidance technologies have emerged, raising expectations for a future with autonomous vehicles in which crashes can be avoided. By studying real-world crash data, it can be seen that both systems for injury prevention as well as systems for collision avoidance do have considerable effects on the number of injuries. Developing assessment tools that predictively can quantify how many crashes can be avoided, but also predict the effect on injuries from those remaining, non-avoided, crashes is therefore important for injury prevention in future passenger vehicles.",
                        "Today, assessment of the real-world safety performance of a vehicle model is done by analysis of retrospective data, available years after introduction. In addition to this, the effect of safety systems is predicted before these safety systems have been put into production. This is done with established methods involving physical crash testing and simulation using computer aided engineering (CAE). For integrated safety, i.e. how safety systems aimed at collision avoidance and injury prevention interact with and complement each other, methods need to be refined in order to make such predictions. The use of virtual tools for integrated safety is therefore a key component in order to predict expected crash outcomes, providing decision-making data for developing the most effective safety systems.",
                        "In this process, understanding future crash scenarios and transferring this knowledge into specific crash configurations becomes an important factor. Methods of calculating the effect of collision avoidance systems in terms of injury outcomes and accidents avoided or mitigated have been developed. Such a method based on available traffic accident data has been developed with the aim to support the system development process by offering an opportunity to alternate input parameters, such as, braking (acceleration) level in order to determine the effect of these changes. The method has further refined including the actual system algorithm in a relevant vehicle and sensing model. These methods include estimations of the consequences of a crash using risk functions based on real-world traffic accident data, by assuming a modified injury risk as a result of reduced crash severity. However, these methods, as well as established ways for describing crashes, such as using the collision deformation classification (CDC) or principal direction of force (PDOF), have been found to lack the level of detail needed to describe subtle relative changes in crash configuration to support CAE studies in the form of structural and occupant finite element (FE) simulations. With a refined description of crash configurations, the effects of collision avoidance interventions can be described and evaluated by simulating a range of traffic situations that are likely to occur. By applying probable distributions of the input parameters, the robustness and sensitivity of the system can be evaluated.",
                        "Another context for which the interaction between systems for collision avoidance and injury prevention becomes increasingly important relates to occupant re-positioning due to pre-crash accelerations, regardless whether human drivers or autonomous intervention systems. These effects are possible to study in volunteer experiments and it has been found that the muscle activation of car occupants has a considerable influence on the kinematic pre-crash response, leading to a need for active human body models (A-HBMs) in order to study these effects using CAE tools. Several approaches to A-HBMs have been proposed and a potential for use in product development has been demonstrated. The most detailed injury prediction response based on tissue level can be provided by FE A-HBMs, which, however, are all computationally intensive. This is even more pronounced when pre-crash maneuvers are considered, these often have a duration of seconds whereas crash simulations typically span 100-200 milliseconds. It is therefore not seen as feasible to deploy FE A-HBMs directly in larger simulation studies with thousands of cases for estimating the effect of collision avoidance systems. In this context, a computationally efficient model indicating occupant pre-crash motion including effects of muscle tensioning is therefore desired. With such a tool, a smaller number of critical or dimensioning cases could be filtered out from a larger sample set for further analysis using FE A-HBMs. From volunteer studies of belted passenger car occupant kinematics during pre-crash maneuvers, it has been observed that the pelvis displacement is small compared to the movement of the head and torso, suggesting a model of only the upper body could be could be useful for studying pre-crash occupant kinematics.",
                        "Thus, the overall aim of the present disclosure is to create a CAE methodology for predicting the combined safety performance from collision avoidance systems (e.g. autonomous emergency braking (AEB)) as well as systems for injury prevention (e.g. seatbelts and airbags). Specific aims are to establish two important elements in this simulation methodology. The first element concerns real-world data, and the transfer of real-world pre-crash situations into crash configurations to be used in crash simulations providing insight into occupant protection. The second considers the human occupant, enabling computationally efficient prediction of position transfer between pre-crash situations and crashes. This background provides an exemplary context and environment only for the methodologies of the present disclosure, and it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the methodologies of the present disclosure may be practiced in other contexts and environments as well."

For cases in which the crash is not avoided by the AEB function, the crash configuration is identified. A SOCKIMO is developed and applied to these remaining crashes, supporting the selection of crash situations to be analyzed in detail. The SAFER HBM is used for simulation of the occupant response, providing information on pre-crash kinematics, as well as the occupant crash response.",

In its simplest form, the driver model is a path follower that provides driver input in order to make the vehicle follow the time-dependent states given in the real-world data cases 12. The validity of the CA-CAE tools 14 should be ensured by comparing subsets of pre-crash simulation data to corresponding data collected from physical tests performed on test tracks or public roads.",

For this purpose, element 3 in FIG. 1 regarding crash configuration 16 and element 4, an occupant pre-crash kinematics model 18, are defined. These elements describe how the pre-crash phase has influenced the crash configuration as well as how the occupant position may have been affected by the pre-crash phase.

Since the number of cases can be extensive, the occupant pre-crash kinematics model 18 is used to further filter out cases where it can be expected that the occupant would experience considerable pre-crash excursion, i.e. displacement due to vehicle accelerations. By selecting this smaller sample of the collision avoidance simulation cases 16, the simulation effort using the FE A-HBM (element 7) 22, where the pre-crash vehicle kinematics is combined with the crash pulse from the FE structural crash simulation 24, can be substantially reduced.",

This simulation could theoretically include also an FE A-HBM, however due to computational efficiency, the structural and occupant crash simulations are normally split into two separate simulations for each case. In this way, output from the FE structural crash simulation 24 can be fed into the complete-sequence (pre-crash and crash) occupant crash simulation using an FE A-HBM 22, element 7 in FIG. 1.",

This is a 50th percentile male model based on the THUMS v3 model but substantially updated by the partners of the SAFER Vehicle and Traffic Safety Centre at Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden. The head and brain model is replaced with the KTH head model, for example.

In this definition, the host vehicle 36 serves as the reference system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), where the FPOC is described. Furthermore, the heading direction is defined to coincide with the longitudinal axis of each vehicle, even though in the generalized case the velocity vector at the time of collision may differ from the heading direction in the crash configuration. By utilizing the host center point (HCPO), a counter-clockwise angle around HCPO between the host center plane (HCPL) and the FPOC can be defined as the original host collision point angle (called HCPAO), as illustrated in FIG. 4.",
                        "In the same way, the location of the FPOC on the opponent vehicle 38 is defined as the original opponent collision point angle (called OCPAO) using the local reference system of the opponent vehicle 38. By using a third angle in the horizontal plane, the heading direction of the opponent vehicle 38 is defined relative to the heading direction of the host vehicle 36. This angle is called the opponent yaw angle (OYA), as indicated in FIG. 5.",
                        "By using the definitions above, the description of the FPOC in terms of HCPAO and OCPAO is dependent on the vehicle width-to-length ratio. However, a more universal way of describing the angles is sought, therefore the vehicle dimensions including the FPOC are scaled to a square unit vehicle as described in FIG. 6. In this way, a transformed host collision point angle (HCPA) is defined for further use. The same procedure is applied to obtain the transformed opponent collision point angle (OCPA).",
                        "The proposed method for describing crash configuration can be used as a tool for visualizing larger sets of crash configuration data to be considered in the development of safety systems. In FIG. 7, three examples of vehicle-to-vehicle collisions are used to explain how a crash configuration diagram can be created. FIG. 7 shows how the transformed host and opponent collision point angles HCPA and OCPA combined with the opponent yaw angle OYA for the impact direction gives a graphic illustration of each crash configuration directly in the diagram. By using a variety of vehicle types, it is seen that their shape generally has a small influence on the crash configuration. However, some crash configurations defined using a rectangular vehicle shape may differ from configurations where a vehicle with rounded corners is used.",
                        "Simplified Occupant Kinematics Model \u2014SOCKIMO (element 4) 18. As previously stated, pre-crash simulations often consider a large amount of cases, typically more than a thousand for a specific conflict situation. To assess occupant pre-crash kinematics in these large datasets, the need for a computationally efficient model is identified as a tool that at an overall level describes how the pre-crash phase may affect occupant kinematics. It is therefore suggested to describe the upper body of a vehicle occupant as an inverted pendulum constrained in the sagittal plane. This model used for pure braking scenarios where the effect of AEB interventions could be quantified in terms of occupant pre-crash excursion. In the course of this work, a need for a model useful also in maneuvers including lateral accelerations is identified. This leads to the initiation of a project aimed at describing the occupant as one or more inverted pendula free to move in three dimensions. The studies conclude that a double pendulum model could be employed and using joint stiffness and damping parameters be tuned to fit the response of volunteers.",
                        "FIG. 8 provides a graphical representation of how the simplified model 40 is implemented. Rigid bodies are assumed between the head center of gravity 42, first thoracic vertebrae (T1) 44, sternum 46, and the hip joint 48. These are positions that were all featured as tracking points in available volunteer data, later used for tuning and validating the model 40. A lower inverted pendulum is based in the occupant hip joint location 48 and includes a point representing the sternum 46. At the upper end of the lower pendulum, corresponding to the center of the T1 vertebra 44, a hinge joint is defined. This hinge joint attaches to the upper pendulum that ends in the head center of gravity 42. By defining this hinge joint, the upper pendulum is constrained to movement in the plane initially defined by the hip joint 48, T1 44, and head center of gravity 42. Since this plane is updated corresponding to the displacement of the lower pendulum, the head center of gravity 42 is free to move out of the initial sagittal plane.",
                        "The seat back 50 was modeled as a contact to prevent the pendula model from tilting rearwards, using contact stiffness based on an FE model representing a typical passenger vehicle seat. Seat belt forces were assumed to be applied in the point representing the sternum 46 on a fixed distance between the hip joint 48 and T1 44, as illustrated in FIG. 8. In both the lower (spherical) joint 48 and the upper (hinge) joint 44, two parameters were introduced characterizing the stiffness (Nm/rad) and the damping (Nm/rad/s).",
                        "In order to find appropriate joint parameters, volunteer tests are used and the model is tuned accordingly. This process enables parameter sets representing a range of individual volunteer responses, and the final SOCKIMO 18 (FIG. 1) includes seven different such sets, for example. The tuning process shows that the SOCKIMO 18 can capture not only the magnitude of excursion but also the dynamic response, as shown in FIG. 9. The combined maneuver for which the model is tuned consists of steering and braking with maximum accelerations of approximately 0.5 g.",
                        "The tuned SOCKIMO 18 is thereafter validated by using a separate data set, as shown in FIG. 10. From these volunteer tests, a corridor representing the and 0.16th and 0.84th quantiles of the response of 25 volunteers is used and compared to the model response.",
                        "EXAMPLE CASE. To demonstrate the methodology, an example case was selected from left turn/oncoming direction (LT/OD) conflict situations. These are characterized by the host vehicle turning left in a crossing and being struck by an oncoming vehicle that approaches from the direction opposite to the host vehicle initial direction, i.e. before the turn is initiated.",
                        "Case selection (elements 1-6). In the first stage, the baseline generation framework was applied. First, crashes in a TAD were classified and LT/OD crashes were identified. Crash case analysis was performed on the pre-crash phase of each case in detail, and a dataset was generated from all cases. In this dataset, each crash was described numerically in a THd format where each time step, during 15 seconds before the crash or near-crash, depicts the vehicle trajectories, the road environment, the participants, and their characteristics. In order to compensate for uncertainties in the data relating to case data quality and contingency of distributions, variations of parameters were implemented as synthetic cases in a THd-batch, including in total 940 cases for simulation.",
                        "Pre-crash Baseline and Treatment simulations were performed as a next step. In the baseline setting, all cases resulted in a collision for which the host vehicle impact speed ranged from 4 to 30 km/h, and the opponent vehicle speed ranged from 4 to 131 km/h. By using a conceptual AEB system, a portion of the cases were completely avoided and, in another portion, there was no effect of the AEB system. In a third portion, mitigation of the crash was achieved by the AEB system. All remaining crashes were analyzed in further detail utilizing the crash configuration depicting method PARCC and the SOCKIMO, and typical situations were identified for the case study.",
                        "The SOCKIMO was used to identify cases with large occupant pre-crash excursions in combination with a substantial crash severity. The SOCKIMO analysis was made with an average of the seven occupant parameter sets in FIG. 10. Initially, a maximum SOCKIMO total head excursion above 150 mm during the complete pre-crash maneuver was used as filtering criterion. An additional filtering criterion was used to find one example case for which a substantial crash severity was present. Since the crash severity in the studied cases is highly governed by the impact speed of the opponent vehicle, cases with an opponent speed above 60 km/h were selected, see four encircled candidate cases in FIG. 11. A case with a crash configuration notably modified by the AEB intervention was selected, resulting in the example case described in Table 1. Both Baseline and Treatment cases included a maximum vehicle lateral acceleration of 1.5 m/s2 and maximum yaw velocity of 21 deg/s.",
                        "The selected case was then simulated using the SAFER HBM occupant model positioned in the host vehicle in four different combinations of PCVK and crash pulse, as described in Table 2. Simulations BB and TT describe the cases from the CA-CAE tool shown in Table 1, and simulations denoted nB and TB were included in order to study the individual effects of PCVK and crash pulse, respectively. The FE structural crash simulations were performed using two identical mid-size passenger vehicles to provide the crash pulse needed for the FE A-HBM occupant simulation.",
                        "Output from FE A-HBM occupant simulation\u2014element 7. A clear effect from the pre-crash maneuver as well as crash configuration on driver head trajectory in a vehicle-fixed coordinate system could be seen, see FIG. 12. The measured effect of the Baseline PCVK is a maximum excursion of 28 mm forward (x) and 44 mm to the right (y). The Treatment PCVK results in a maximum excursion 148 mm forward (x) and 46 mm to the right (y). However, the Treatment PCVK final position is 30 mm rearward (x) and 36 mm to the left (Y) of the origin.",
                        "By further analyzing the head center of gravity trajectories in FIG. 12 during the crash phase, it was found that the effect of introducing the Treatment crash had a considerable effect. The Baseline crash pulse introduced a substantial lateral component to the crash pulse, which leads to occupant excursion that has approximately the same magnitude to the right as forward. In the Treatment crash (see Table 1), the opponent vehicle overlaps the host vehicle to a lesser extent, thereby reducing the lateral acceleration component of the host vehicle during the crash phase. The Treatment crash pulse leads to an occupant excursion with low deviation from the vehicle longitudinal direction and increases the lateral excursion only during rebound.",
                        "When comparing the three simulations where the Baseline crash pulse was used (nB, BB, and TB), it was found that although the initial positions for the crash phase differed, the head trajectory during crash was similar. The maximum lateral head displacement in simulations nB, BB, and TB was approximately the same at 450-460 mm. The TB simulation results however suggested that an outboard/rearward initial crash position (i.e. to the left of and behind the origin) led to a longer duration of the interaction with the driver airbag reducing the maximum forward displacement compared to nominal position in the nB simulation. In contrast, the BB simulation results suggested a shorter airbag interaction duration, which was associated with a larger maximum forward displacement.",
                        "Thus, the present disclosure provides a CAE methodology that allows for estimation of the combined safety effects from collision avoidance and injury prevention systems. In a demonstration case, combinations of pre-crash maneuvers and subsequent crash was presented as an example of the feasibility of the method. The present methodology constitutes a framework for dealing with the large data sets that can be generated through CAE pre-crash simulations of collision avoidance technologies applied to real-world traffic situations. A crash configuration definition for setting up crash simulations or physical crash tests was introduced and a simplified occupant kinematic model for filtering out cases for detailed analysis is provided. The SOCKIMO provided an indication of large occupant pre-crash excursion that was also reflected when using the SAFER HBM.",
                        "Cases were filtered out when the largest SOCKIMO excursion exceeded 150 mm, regardless when this maximum excursion occurred during the pre-crash maneuver. The excursion at the time of crash initiation may prove to be a better metric for occupant pre-positioning relevant for injury prediction. On the other hand, once a large occupant excursion has occurred, this could be associated with non-linear effects that the SOCKIMO is not able to capture. Such an example could be seat belt interaction where the effect on occupant kinematics could be studied in a more realistic way using the A-HBM, for which also the effect of electrical reversible retractors (ERR) can be studied. There is a risk that the SOCKIMO will point out cases where the occupant excursion is not a problem in terms of predicted injury risk during the crash phase. This depends on the combination of pre-crash maneuver and type of crash. For some crashes, certain pre-crash maneuvers may actually be beneficial for improving the occupant interaction with the restraint system, in some cases unfavorable. Another factor that influences the occupant pre-crash excursion is whether the arms are used for bracing against the steering wheel or other vehicle interior components. In the current implementation, the SOCKIMO is optionally tuned for front seat passengers for which no bracing is present, while the SAFER HBM was run as a driver with hands on the steering wheel and active arm muscles simulating this bracing. This could be one reason why the SOCKIMO head excursion exceeds that of the driver A-HBM. (SOCKIMO ca 230 mm in FIG. 11 vs A-HBM approximately 150 mm, FIG. 12). An additional reason for this may be found when observing validation data suggesting that several of the seven parameter sets of the SOCKIMO lead to pre-crash motions larger than the volunteer corridors as shown in FIG. 10. Occupant excursion as predicted by the SOCKIMO may not be accurate as a prediction of actual occupant excursion but rather as an indicator when comparing sets of pre-crash vehicle kinematic data.",
                        "The crash simulation phase in this study was performed using a rigid sled, i.e. assuming no compartment intrusion. Although modern passenger vehicles often exhibit minimal intrusion, there are and will still be situations where this is not the case. Typically, this assumption could not be made when intrusion occurs in the direct surrounding of the occupant such as in side impacts. In such cases, a deformable sled where intrusions are recorded from full-scale structural FE crash simulations and then applied to the virtual sled with the A-HBM may be useful. Alternatively, the A-HBM can be placed directly in the full-scale model, however this approach is currently judged as unfeasible due to the large simulation effort that would further limit the number of studied cases.",
                        "The proposed crash configuration method PARCC was shown to be sensitive to changes based on pre-crash AEB interventions. Although the provided example case displayed large differences in terms of PARCC parameters and subsequently significantly different resulting crash pulses, the methodology is detailed enough to describe also subtle geometrical changes in crash configuration not captured in established methods using e.g. CDC. PARCC was demonstrated in vehicle-to-vehicle crash situations, however it can also be applied to collision objects such as trucks or vulnerable road users. In order for the method to remain generic, the shape of the traffic objects should be defined in such a way that only one point is intersected at a time when a vector is swept the full 360 degrees around the object center as described in the crash configuration section.",
                        "Thus, a methodology for predicting the performance of safety systems with a combined effect from collision avoidance and injury prevention features is presented. In this process, methods for describing crash configurations are introduced. This method supports detailed descriptions of crashes and is sensitive to changes in configurations based on pre-crash maneuvers. Further, a SOCKIMO is introduced as a tool for filtering out cases where considerable occupant pre-crash excursion can be suspected to occur. The feasibility of the individual elements of this methodology to function together is demonstrated in an example case where autonomous emergency braking leads to a considerable change in the crash configuration and is predicted to introduce substantial occupant pre-crash excursion. In addition, in this example case it is shown that the present A-HBM tool is able to cover the complete sequence of events from pre-crash maneuvers to crash in one single simulation, thereby demonstrating how the tool chain efficiently contributes to evaluating the injury prevention effects from both pre-crash and crash countermeasures in the vehicle.",
