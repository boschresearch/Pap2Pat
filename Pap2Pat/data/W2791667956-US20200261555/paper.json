    "abstract": "PEGylated human truncated cystathionine beta-synthase, lacking the C-terminal regulatory domain (PEG-CBS), is a promising preclinical candidate for enzyme replacement therapy in homocystinuria (HCU). It was designed to function as a metabolic sink to decrease the severely elevated plasma and tissue homocysteine concentrations. In this communication, we evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and sub-chronic toxicity of PEG-CBS in homocystinuric mice, wild type rats and monkeys to estimate the minimum human efficacious dose for clinical trials. Animal models received single or multiple doses of PEG-CBS. Activity of PEG-CBS and sulfur amino acid metabolites were determined in plasma and used to determine PK and PD. The plasma half-lives of PEG-CBS after a single subcutaneous (SC) injection were approximately 20, 44 and 73 h in mouse, rat and monkey, respectively. The SC administration of PEG-CBS resulted in a significant improvement or full correction of metabolic imbalance in both blood and tissues of homocystinuric mice. The PD of PEG-CBS in mouse was dose-dependent, but less than dose-proportional, with the maximal efficacy achieved at 8 mg/kg. PEG-CBS was well-tolerated in mice and monkeys, but resulted in dose-dependent minimal-to-moderate inflammation at the injection sites and vacuolated macrophages in rats. Allometric scaling of animal data was linear and the estimated human efficacious dose was determined as 0.66 mg/kg administered once a week. These results provide critical preclinical data for the design of first-in-human PEG-CBS clinical trial.",

                "Classical homocystinuria (HCU; OMIM# 236200) is a metabolic disorder caused by an inherited deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS; EC# 4.2. 1.22). CBS condenses homocysteine with serine to cystathionine and its deficiency leads to accumulation of homocysteine and methionine and subsequent clinical symptoms [25]. The disease manifests in four major organ systems: the eye (severe myopia, dislocated lens), the skeletal and connective tissues (osteoporosis), the vasculature (thromboembolism, stroke) and the central nervous system (mental retardation, seizures) [25]. Symptoms vary in both severity and onset time, from severe multisystemic childhood onset to a nearly asymptomatic presentation in adulthood. The severity of HCU mostly depends on the amount of residual enzymatic activity driven by the type of mutation in the cbs gene. Severely affected patients require treatment with a methionine-restricted diet supplemented with cysteine and/or betaine to limit production of excess homocysteine. In some patients, very high doses of pyridoxine, a precursor of CBS cofactor, may increase the residual activity of some mutant CBS enzymes. Poor compliance with both the methionine-restricted diet and betaine is common when patients reach adolescence [24,33]. Although the methionine-restricted diet may avoid elevated homocysteine levels and therefore prevent negative clinical outcomes, substantial unmet need for alternative treatment remains for the majority of HCU patients.",
                "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) represents an alternative treatment option to address the underlying enzymatic deficiency. Human CBS is a homotetrameric enzyme with a complex architecture and regulation involving three cofactors: heme of enigmatic function located at the N-terminus, catalytically active pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate in the central core and allosteric activator S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding to the C-terminal regulatory domain of the CBS subunit [21]. In its native form, CBS is not suitable for ERT development due to its requirement for activation by SAM and its tendency to aggregate. Removal of the C-terminal domain yields a SAM-independent, highly active dimeric human truncated enzyme with high-yield recombinant expression and no aggregation, making it an excellent candidate for development as an ERT for HCU [4]. However, the plasma half-life of the injected truncated enzyme in a mouse model of HCU was 2.7 h and thus the truncated enzyme was conjugated with polyethylene glycol (i.e. PEGylated) to increase its half-life and enable long-term treatment [4]. PEGylation is a well-recognized technique to improve chemical/ physical properties of therapeutic peptides and proteins and to enhance the bioactivity of the conjugates, namely to prolong half-life and to decrease immunogenicity of the biologically active component [26,31]. Indeed, PEGylation of the truncated human CBS with 2 kDa linear and 40 kDa 4-branch maleimide PEG targeting accessible sulfhydryl groups resulted in 6.2-and 11.3-times longer half-life of the conjugates compared to the unmodified enzyme after intravenous administration to HCU mouse [4]. In order to identify the most promising PEG-CBS as a lead candidate for clinical development, we rank-ordered several conjugates with sulfhydryl-targeting maleimide PEGs or amino group-targeting N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS) ester-activated PEG in vivo, characterized the PEGylation sites and compared reproducibility of manufacturing [20]. The enzyme modified with 20 kDa linear NHS ester PEG (further referred to as PEG-CBS) showed excellent potency in vivo after repeated administration. This PEG-CBS conjugate was observed to have an average five PEG chains attached to each protein subunit with no reduction in enzyme's catalytic activity compared with the unmodified protein [20].",
                "In this study, we determined pharmacokinetics (PK) of PEG-CBS in three animal models: homocystinuric mice, wild type (WT) Sprague-Dawley rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. The use of an HCU mouse model instead of WT mice permitted the assessment of pharmacodynamics (PD) effects and the PK-PD relationship for PEG-CBS. Allometric scaling of the PK parameters was conducted across species to estimate the human efficacious dose (HED) and the PK parameters in human clinical trials. The sub-chronic toxicity (clinical signs, gross macroscopic pathology, organ histology and hematology) was evaluated in rats and monkeys during and after 2 weeks of repeated dosing to estimate the human safety margin relative to the HED."

Human Only (HO) mice were generated in our lab [15], the CBS knockout (KO) mice [35] were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and both strains were propagated and genotyped as described previously [4,16]. Animals were maintained on extruded standard diet 2920X (Envigo). A single-use lancet for submandibular bleeding was used for blood collection into Capiject T-MLHG lithium heparin (12.5 IU) tubes with gel (Terumo Medical Corporation). The tubes were then centrifuged at 1,200 \u00d7g for 10 min, followed by transfer of plasma to 1.5 ml tubes and storage at -80 \u00b0C. The design studies using HO mice is summarized in Supplementary Table S1. For a multi dose study, PEG-CBS was administered once every 24 h via SC injection on study days 1-10 (total of 10 injections). Since the untreated KO mice do not readily survive into adolescence, metabolites in liver, kidney and brain tissues were determined in untreated 18 days old KO mice (n = 3) and compared their levels from tissues of age-matched untreated WT mice (n = 3) and PEG-CBS-injected KO mice (n = 3). The treated KO mice received 7.5 mg/kg PEG-CBS since birth via SC injection thrice a week.",
                        "Three separate studies using wild-type Sprague Dawley rats were executed (Supplementary Table S2). Two single dose studies were performed at Charles River Laboratories (Edinburgh, UK). In the original study (study #1), technical difficulties occurred during sample collection and high inter-subject variability was observed as well. For these reasons, a supplemental study was conducted (study #2) using only male rats; however, bioavailability was inexplicably lower compared to study #1. In both studies, the IV data were superimposable suggesting no difference in test item activity and thus sex-related differences in adsorption were the most likely explanation. As the comparison between males and females could not be made because of technical difficulties in study #1, an additional study #3 was designed to verify the apparent differences in absorption in male versus female rats. Although the multi dose study #3 executed at MPI Research (Mattawan, MI, USA) was designed to gain insight into the safety and tolerability of PEG-CBS, the study design was amended to allow extraction of relevant data after the first injection to complement incomplete data sets from studies performed at Charles River Laboratories. The vehicle (PBS) or PEG-CBS were administered in a multi dose study #3 once every 48 h on study days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 (total of 9 injections) via bolus SC injection administered between the skin and underlying layers of tissue in the scapular region on the back of each animal. Both vendors were AAALAC-accredited and the protocols were approved by the local IACUCs. Rats were housed 2-3 per cage in a controlled environment (19-23 \u00b0C, humidity 40-70%, 12 h of light and dark).

Here we determined PK of our clinical candidate PEG-CBS in the HO mouse model of HCU (Fig. 1, Table 1). Fig. 1A shows the levels of CBS activity in plasma over time following a bolus IV or SC injection of 10 mg/kg PEG-CBS. The calculated PK parameters are summarized in Table 1. Elimination half-life of PEG-CBS after IV dosing was about 2 days, which decreased to 17.5 h after SC dosing with absorption half-life of 12.7 h and bioavailability of 64.6%. The elimination phase of the semi-log plots was linear for either route of administration demonstrating that the clearance of PEG-CBS from plasma conformed to first order kinetics (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, we injected HO mice subcutaneously with 0.5\u00d7 and 1.5\u00d7 of 10 mg/kg PEG-CBS to determine the dose response (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Although the peak plasma levels of CBS activity increased with an increasing dose, the differences were not dose proportional. This could likely be explained by a decreased absorption of PEG-CBS from SC compartment with an increasing dose as suggested by decreased bioavailability, thus leading to a lower exposure of PEG-CBS assessed by AUC 0-t /dose."

The PD response to PEG-CBS administration was determined for 3 different SC doses. Fig. 1C shows that the changes in plasma levels of Hcy, Cth and Cys over time were close to maximal at 5 mg/kg of PEG-CBS such that higher doses of 10 or 15 mg/kg resulted in only incremental changes in peak efficacy. Thus, a single SC dose between 5 and 10 mg/ kg produced the maximal efficacy in HO mice."

The minimal and maximal plasma concentrations of PEG-CBS at steady state (i.e. prior to the 8th injection and 12 h after the 9th injection), corrected for the dose, ranged between 27-31 and 29-36 mU/\u03bcl, respectively, for all dose groups.

Fig. 2B shows significant decrease in Hcy levels 24 h after the 1st injection for all doses (p < 0.01).

As shown in Fig. 3A, the levels of plasma CBS activity over time after IV administration of 4 mg/kg PEG-CBS to male and female rats are nearly superimposable. Elimination half-life of PEG-CBS after IV dosing was between 35 and 40 h and the plasma exposure as estimated by area under the curve observed from 0 to 120 h (AUC 0-t ) was not substantially different between sexes. On the other hand, Fig. 3B shows significant differences between males and females after SC injection. The fraction of PEG-CBS absorbed after SC dosing was nearly twice as much in female compared with male rats (p < 0.05). Specifically, the bioavailability in male rats after doses of 8 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg was 18.7% and 21.3%, respectively. In contrast, the bioavailability in female rats after doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg was 36.5% and 35.5%, respectively. As bioavailability of PEG-CBS was nearly identical at the different doses (8 and 24 mg/kg) for each gender, it suggests that the observed differences in absorption in rats were likely due to sexual dimorphism. The elimination phase of PEG-CBS was loglinear in all cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S3) and thus conformed to first  order kinetics. Differences due to sexual dimorphism in rats were also apparent in a repeated dosing study, where the rats received a total of 9 injections 48 h apart of 4, 8 and 24 mg/kg PEG-CBS (Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. S4). In general, initial as well as steady state levels of PEG-CBS activity in plasma were higher in female than male rats at the same dose level correlating well with a similar observation in a single dose study. More importantly, plasma levels of PEG-CBS after repeated dosing demonstrated little or no accumulation at any dose level, even though the doses were administered when slightly more than a half of the PEG-CBS has cleared from the plasma (48 h dosing interval versus average elimination half-life after SC dosing of 44 h). To aid in the understanding of these unexpected observations, the predicted steady state CBS plasma levels were calculated after hypothetical repeated dosing using the simulation function in the PK software. After multiple doses, the observed plasma PEG-CBS activity was 15-52% and 0-35% of the predicted values for the peaks and troughs at steady state, respectively (Supplementary Table S4)."

Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption and clinical and anatomic pathology. There were no PEG-CBS-related effects noted for mortality, clinical observations, body weight, organ weight or macroscopic evaluations in either male or female rats at any dose level. Female rats injected with PEG-CBS decreased their food consumption 9-13% at termination compared to PBS-injected controls. However, changes lacked dose-dependency and did not result in changes in body weights, thus were not considered as adverse effects. Microscopic examination of injection sites showed dose-dependent minimal to moderate accumulation of vacuolated macrophages accompanied by minimal to moderate subacute/chronic inflammation in both rat sexes. These changes persisted during the two-week recovery period. More importantly, there were no treatment-related clinical observations noted during treatment or the recovery period in monkeys. Based on these findings, the no-observedadverse-effect-level (NOAEL) established in rats and monkeys for PEG-  CBS was 24 and 10 mg/kg, respectively."

                        "Interspecies comparison was conducted based on body weight scaling in order to estimate PK in humans and HED. Bioavailability of PEG-CBS after the SC administration was ~80% in mice and monkeys, but only 19-37% in rats. The allometric scaling assumed the corrected for an 80% bioavailability in rats for the estimates of c max and AUC in humans. When the selected PK parameters, such as t 1/2-E , c max /dose and AUC 0-t /dose, were plotted against the body weight on a log-log scale, a linear correlation was observed suggesting that these parameters are likely predictive of human values (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S5). Thus, in a human patient weighing 70 kg, the PEG-CBS elimination halflife t 1/2-E , c max /dose and AUC 0-t /dose were predicted to be 176.4 h, 33.2 mU/\u03bcl/(mg/kg) and 7236 mU-h/\u03bcl/(mg/kg), respectively. PEG-CBS was absorbed slowly into the bloodstream after a single SC administration in all 3 species with adsorption half-lives similar across species and ranging between 5.3 and 12.7 h in HO mice, 8.9-14.6 h in rats and 7.9-9.7 h in monkeys (Tables 123). These values lead to t max values that ranged from 24 to 48 h across 3 species allowing to reasonably assume a range between 48 and 72 h in humans. These predicted PK parameters in human allowed for construction of a hypothetical PK curve after a single SC administration in humans, which subsequently enabled modeling of a multiple dose PK curves assuming first order elimination kinetics in humans. Table 4 summarizes predicted peak and trough plasma PEG-CBS activities in humans after receiving SC doses of 0.33, 0.66 and 1 mg/kg administered once or twice a week assuming 80% bioavailability. From these calculations, an SC dose of 0.66 mg/kg PEG-CBS administered to a human patient once a week is predicted to give plasma levels that range between 30.8 and 45.2 mU/\u03bcl at steady state. Similarly, an SC dose of 0.33 mg/kg PEG-CBS administered twice a week is predicted to give plasma levels that range between 34.5 and 41 mU/\u03bcl at steady state. These doses and regimens are thus expected to produce peak and trough plasma levels at steady state that are in the efficacious range for PEG-CBS as determined in HO mice (peak level of 51.3 mU/\u03bcl after a single 5 mg/kg SC dose, Table 2). Taken together, a calculated PEG-CBS dose of 0.33 mg/kg administered 2\u00d7 weekly or 0.66 mg/kg administered 1\u00d7 weekly will likely be effective doses in human clinical trials."

                        "The calculated volume of distribution at steady state in monkey after a single IV dose of 2 mg/kg PEG-CBS was 73 \u00b1 4 ml, which is roughly equivalent to plasma volume in a 3 kg Cynomolgus monkey (109 ml) [1] suggesting that PEG-CBS resides in circulation with low tissue penetration. However, the repeated administration of PEG-CBS improved or entirely normalized metabolic balance in tissues of the most severely affected HCU mouse model, the KO mice (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S6). Hcy was greatly accumulated in tissues of the KO mice compared to the WT controls (75/4/23-fold in liver/kidney/ The data represents mean \u00b1 SEM. brain), but the treatment resulted in its significant reduction in liver (p < 0.01) and normalization in kidney and brain (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, Cys levels were not markedly different among WT controls, untreated KO mice and PEG-CBS-injected KO mice (Fig. 6B). Tissue Cth was 8-18-fold diminished in the KO mice compared to the WT controls (Fig. 6C). The administration of PEG-CBS resulted in its normalization in liver, a 60-fold accumulation in kidney compared to WT levels (p < 0.01) and a 4-fold increase in brain compared to the untreated KO levels (p < 0.01). Similarly to Hcy, Met was markedly elevated in KO mice tissues compared to the WT mice, but the ERT essentially normalized its levels in all tissues (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, highly elevated Met levels in tissues of KO mice resulted in a 13-fold accumulation of  SAM only in their livers compared to WT mice, while SAM levels in kidney and brain remained unchanged (Fig. 6E). Treatment normalized SAM levels in livers of KO mice. On the other hand, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was elevated in all studied tissues of the KO mice compared to the WT controls (Fig. 6F). Treatment of KO mice with PEG-CBS resulted in a substantial reduction of SAH (p < 0.05), but not a normalization compared to WT (p < 0.05). Taken together, PEG-CBS, which predominantly distributes in blood circulation, formed a catabolic sink for plasma Hcy leading to a restoration of the metabolic balance in the examined tissues."

                "The translation of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological findings from animal studies to human estimates serves as a guide to design optimal Investigational New Drug (IND) program enabling long term GLP toxicology studies and subsequent phase I/II clinical trials ( [29,36]. We evaluated PK of PEG-CBS after single and repeated dosing at 3 different dosing levels in HCU mice, WT rats and Cynomolgus monkeys in non-GLP preliminary studies. Executed multiple dose studies were designed to monitor sub-chronic toxicity in parallel with repeated dose PK, to estimate the NOAEL in non-GLP rat and monkey studies and to evaluate the suitability of available animal models.",
                "PEG-CBS is a clinical candidate for ERT against HCU. PEGylation of CBS increased the residence time of the enzyme in circulation by 11fold without decreasing its catalytic activity [4]. The target destination for PEG-CBS is the blood and therefore the plasma PK studies directly represent the levels at the site of action allowing for uniquely relevant PK/PD studies. This approach represents an advantage over intracellularly targeted ERTs, such as those approved for lysosomal storage disorders, which depend on their glycosylation pattern enabling the ERT to be internalized by the cells and directed to the lysosomes (reviewed in [32]).",
                "PEG-CBS has been identified as the most promising conjugate with a great efficacy profile in treating murine HCU and its production is scalable for commercial manufacturing [16,20]. PEG-CBS was found to rapidly and effectively decrease the toxic load of Hcy in blood, liver, kidney and brain tissues of HCU mice and was well tolerated over many months of dosing from early days after birth. We showed here (Fig. 6) and in our previous work [4,16] that the circulating PEG-CBS significantly improves or normalizes the underlying metabolic imbalance associated with HCU in target tissues, such as liver, kidney and brain. The correction of the tissue metabolites is made possible by lowering Hcy in plasma by PEG-CBS with a subsequent outflow of Hcy out of the tissues. Condensation of Hcy with serine by PEG-CBS leads to an elevation of Cth in plasma and kidney (most likely due to its urinary excretion), similar to the levels seen in hereditary cystathioninuria, which may be a benign biochemical finding with no adverse clinical effects [6,12,34]. In addition to Cth, PEG-CBS was found to affect plasma and tissue levels of related thioethers lanthionine (Lth) and homolanthionine (Hlth) in healthy Cynomolgus monkeys and HCU mice [18]. The biological functions of Lth and Hlth are unknown; however, they represent relevant surrogate markers of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) biosynthesis by the enzymes of transsulfuration pathway [10,18]. In particular, Hlth and simultaneous H 2 S production from Hcy by cystathionine gamma-lyase was 32-times higher in HCU patients compared to healthy population controls [10]. When HCU mice were treated with PEG-CBS, levels of Hlth were fully normalized in liver, where the majority of transsulfuration pathway activity occurs, and significantly decreased in kidney and brain [18]. H 2 S was shown to exert a multitude of physiological effects including those on vasculature [9] and hepatic functions [22]. In addition, PEG-CBS treatment normalized plasma concentration of Cys (Supplementary Fig. S2B) [16,17,20], which is substantially decreased in HCU [25]. This effect is most likely indirect as similar finding was observed in HCU mice fed with Met-restricted diet [7]. It has been hypothesized that any treatment (e.g. dietary or PEG-CBS), which results in the decrease of plasma Hcy levels, normalizes plasma Cys, which is otherwise lost due to an increased urinary excretion of Hcy-Cys disulfides [13]. In stark contrast to HCU patients, plasma Met levels in mouse models of HCU are normal or only slightly elevated compared to controls [19]. However, severely elevated Met concentrations in plasma and tissues were observed in ~3-weeks old KO mice (Fig. 6D) [16] and they were totally normalized with the treatment. Taken together, by acting on plasma Hcy, PEG-CBS in circulation partially or fully normalizes sulfur amino acid metabolites above as well as below the block in plasma and tissues of several mouse models of HCU.",
                "In addition to the ability of PEG-CBS to correct the clinical manifestation of HCU in model mice, we showed here that (i) the PK profile of PEG-CBS activity was predictable and dose-proportional in mice and monkeys, (ii) the PD response was rapid and coincided with plasma levels of the enzyme and (iii) the PEG-CBS was well tolerated with no adverse effects following a repeated dosing in monkeys. The PK properties of PEG-CBS in rats were different than that observed in mice and monkeys. The absorption of PEG-CBS from the SC compartment was lower in rat (< 30%) compared to mouse and monkey (> 80%), and sexual dimorphism was observed with nearly 50% lower absorption of PEG-CBS in male compared to female rats. Furthermore, lack of PEG-CBS accumulation in plasma after repeated dosing at all dose levels was surprising and unexpected, especially compared to the results in the mice and primates. In addition, minimal to moderate accumulation of vacuolated macrophages and inflammation of the injection site was associated with repeated administration of PEG-CBS in rats. It is possible to conclude, however, that rat is not a suitable species to conduct long-term GLP toxicology studies with PEG-CBS. All these observations can be most likely explained by an immune response to PEG-CBS, its neutralization and increased clearance from the circulation of rats. Similar to our observation, preclinical testing of PEGylated human interferon (IFN)-beta-1a also showed substantially lower bioavailability after SC administration in rats compared to monkeys (28 versus 100%) [27]. Cellular vacuolation, particularly of skin macrophages at the SC injection site, has been observed in approximately half of the nonclinical toxicology studies of the approved PEGylated drugs [8]. Since removal of foreign material from circulation is a normal function of phagocytic cells, the resulting vacuolation is typically considered a normal physiological response, which was found to be PEG size-, doseand time-dependent [30]. More importantly, no functional impact of vacuolation was reported in toxicology studies and no indication of PEG-related adverse effects has been reported from clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance with any of the approved PEGylated drugs [8].",
                "Here we used allometry and PK-and PK/PD-guided modeling approach to estimate HED for FIH clinical trial. Subcutaneous administration of PEG-CBS is intended to occur roughly every half-life, which has been estimated to be approximately 7 in humans. Compared to ERTs for lysosomal disorders, which are typically clinically administered IV infusions weekly or every two weeks [32], the proposed SC administration of PEG-CBS would allow self-administration at home with no need to travel to an outpatient clinic. To lessen the burden on patients and their families, some patients with lysosomal disorder receiving ERT may be transitioned from well-controlled settings of outpatient infusion clinics to home therapy, where the ERT administration is conducted under the care of trained infusion personnel [23]. In addition, compliance with treatment regimen was improved in patients on home therapy [5]. The HED estimated here based on PK/PD relationship studies in mice and monkeys is approximately 0.66 mg/kg PEG-CBS with weekly SC administration. Pending the NOAEL of long-term toxicity studies in monkeys, the predictable and dose-dependent PK profiles and PK/PD relationships of PEG-CBS in mouse and monkey provides enough confidence to use herein described HED forward into phase I clinical trial.",
                "Our data suggest that HO mice on a standard lab chow can to achieve significant reductions in Hcy concentrations, but not a complete normalization even with a substantially increased dose of PEG-CBS (Fig. 2B). Reactive nature of Hcy leads to its strong binding to free sulfhydryls forming (mixed) disulfides and often displacing Cys from its binding to proteins. PEG-CBS has the capability to alter the balance between protein-bound and free forms of Hcy (either as free reduced or in a form of disulfides) [28], thus leading to a substantial decrease of total Hcy in plasma of treated HO mice. Thus, the lack of complete normalization of plasma Hcy levels by PEG-CBS in HO mice most likely stems from other factors, such as slow protein turnover, balance between vascular and extravascular pools of Hcy or constant flux of Hcy from intracellular compartment. It is noteworthy, that the HO mice used here were maintained on a standard diet (19% protein), i.e. with no restriction of dietary Met intake. It is plausible that partial Met restriction may result in a complete normalization of Hcy levels combined with PEG-CBS treatment. Interestingly, even severe Met restriction (i.e. 0.5 g/kg Met compared to a regular diet containing 4-6 g/kg Met) did not normalize plasma Hcy levels in HCU mice yielding ~80 \u03bcM Hcy [7]. The opportunity to fully normalize Hcy levels or dramatically reduce diet restrictions with PEG-CBS would be tremendously beneficial to patients and caregivers."
