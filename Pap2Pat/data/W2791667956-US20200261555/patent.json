    "abstract": "The present invention provides a method of PEGylating a human truncated cystathionine \u03b2-synthase protein containing a mutation of a cysteine to a serine at amino acid position 15 (htCBS C15S). The htCBS C15S was PEGylated with one of 5 kDa, 10 kDa, or 20 kDa NHS ester PEG molecules. In-process monitoring of the PEGylation process was used in the method to reduce levels of unPEGylated htCBS C15S and htCBS C15S with insufficient PEGylation. Administration of the PEGylated htCBS C15S had efficacy throughout the course of treatment for homocystinuria.",

                        "Human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS, KEGG enzyme identifier: EC 4.2.1.22) is an important enzyme of the sulfur amino acid metabolism, whose activity determines either recycling of the sulfur in the methionine (Met) cycle or its diversion into synthesis of cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway. See, Finkelstein, J. D., J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990, 1, 228-237, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The critical intermediate of sulfur amino acid metabolism is the non-proteinogenic amino acid homocysteine (Hcy), which can be either converted back to Met by an action of Met synthase or betaine homocysteine methyltransferase or redirected by CBS to cysteine biosynthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. CBS is a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate-dependent homotetrameric hemeprotein, which catalyzes the condensation of Hcy with serine forming cystathionine (Cth) and water. Cth is subsequently hydrolyzed by the action of cystathionine gamma-lyase to cysteine (Cys), alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia, what completes the conversion of the essential amino acid Met to Cys. Activity of CBS, and thus the flux of sulfur through the transsulfuration pathway, is attenuated by the autoinhibitory function of the enzyme's C-terminal regulatory domain. Binding of S-adenosylmethionine to this domain results in a conformational rearrangement of the regulatory domain, subsequent release of the autoinhibitory block and 4-5-fold activation of the enzyme. See, Ereno-Orbea et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2014, 111, (37), E3845-52, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Similar level of CBS activation can be achieved by removal of the C-terminal regulatory domain and consequent formation of a dimeric, permanently activated human truncated enzyme (htCBS). See, Kery et al., Arch Biochem Biophys 1998, 355, (2), 222-32, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
                        "Lack of CBS activity results in classical homocystinuria (HCU), an autosomal recessively inherited rare metabolic disorder. See, Mudd et al., Disorders of transsulfuration. In The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, 8 ed.; Scriver, C. R.; Beaudet, A. L.; Sly, W. S.; Valle, D.; Childs, B.; Kinzler, K.; Vogelstein, B., Eds. McGraw-Hill: New York, 2001; pp 2007-2056 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inactivation of CBS, chiefly due to the presence of missense pathogenic mutations, yields severe elevation of Hcy, Met, and S-adenosylhomocysteine and conversely lack of Cth and decrease of Cys in plasma samples of HCU patients. These biochemical sequelae are accompanied with connective tissue disorders, such as dislocated optic lenses, long and thin limbs and osteoporosis, thromboembolism, cognitive impairment and other clinical symptoms. See, Mudd et al. Present treatment of HCU is mostly symptomatic aimed at reduction of Hcy concentration in the plasma and tissues by protein-restricted diet with Met-free L-amino acid supplementation. See, Komrower et al., Arch Dis Child 1966, 41, (220), 666-71, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This dietary intervention is often combined with betaine, which promotes the remethylation of Hcy back to Met. See, Smolin et al. J Pediatr 99(3), 467-472 (1981), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition, supplementation with the pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate precursor pyridoxine (vitamin B6) was shown to be effective in roughly 50% of HCU patients by stimulating the residual CBS activity and thus relieving the clinical manifestation and relaxing the dietary regime. See, Barber et al. J Pediatr 75(3), 463-778 (1969), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Although Met restriction is generally effective in lowering plasma Hcy levels, a compliance of the HCU patients with the diet is quite poor with consequent manifestation of the symptoms. See, Walter et al., Eur. Pediatr. 1998, 157 (Suppl 2), S71-S76, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus, there is a need in the art for an alternative therapy that would not require a stringent diet but would achieve similar reduction of Hcy levels and prevent onset and/or escalation of the clinical symptoms.",
                        "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for HCU has recently been described using PEGylated htCBS. See, Bublil et al., J Clin Invest 2016, 126, (6), 2372-84 and International application PCT/2016/061050, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. PEGylation is conjugation of protein of interest to one or more polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties or molecules and is a well-recognized and accepted strategy to alter pharmacokinetic profiles of a variety of drugs to improve their therapeutic potential. See, Fishburn et al., J Pharm Sci 2008, 97, (10), 4167-83, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Unmodified htCBS exhibited rapid clearance from the circulation of the mouse model of the disease (elimination half-life after IV administration was 2.7 h). PEGylation of htCBS has been observed to lengthen the elimination half-life of PEGylated htCBS after IV administration by 6-11-fold, improve the plasma metabolic profile of murine homocystinuria in \u201cHuman Only\u201d (HO) mice, and rescue the CBS knock-out (KO) mice from neonatal lethality by preventing liver damage. See, Bublil et al., J Clin Invest 2016, 126, (6), 2372-84; each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.",
                        "There is a long-felt need in the art to design and characterize a PEGylated htCBS conjugate that exhibits high reproducibility and control during manufacturing as well as having long-term efficacy. In previous studies, introduction of the C15S point mutation to htCBS was observed to diminish formation of protein aggregates and higher order oligomers and improved PEGylation profile for 20 kDa linear maleimide-activated PEG molecule. See, Bublil et al. Various htCBS C15S conjugate PEGylated with either maleimide (MA) or N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester-activated PEG molecule (further referred as PEG-htCBS C15S) are characterized herein for their potency to correct metabolic profile of murine homocystinuria after a single administration or multiple rounds of repeated administration interrupted with washout periods. The PEG-htCBS C15S conjugates were ranked based on their pharmacodynamics. In addition, insight was gained into reproducibility and consistency of PEG-htCBS preparation and characterization of the sites modified by the PEG molecules. Assays were identified to monitor and evaluate the extent of htCBS C15S PEGylation."

                                "Homocystinuna (HCU) due to loss of CBS causes accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and depletion of cysteine (Cys). There is a long felt need in the art for an optimized targeted treatment, which would address the underlying enzyme deficiency, thus the development of an enzyme replacement therapy based on PEGylated human truncated CBS (PEG-htCBS) has been explored herein. Attenuation of potency was observed, which warranted screening of several different PEG-htCBS C15S conjugates. The PEG-htCBS C15S conjugates were ranked based on their efficacy to correct plasma metabolite profile of murine homocystinuria after repeated administrations interrupted with washouts. CBS was observed to couple with maleimide PEG molecules inconsistently. In contrast, the PEG-htCBS C15S conjugate with 20 kDa linear NHS-PEG showed very little loss of potency likely due to reproducible PEGylation resulting in species modified with an average of 5 PEGylation sites per peptide. In addition, assays were developed to monitor the extent of CBS PEGylation. These results identified the PEG-htCBS C15S conjugate of those analyzed most suitable for manufacturing and clinical development.",
                                "An integral part of any novel therapeutic development effort, whether it is a small molecule drug or a biologic, is the selection, optimization and characterization of a lead candidate to enter the clinical trials. Although effective, treatment of HCU to reduce methionine (Met) intake through dietary restrictions is very difficult to follow and results in serious patient compliancy issues. See, Walter et al., Eur. J. Pediatr. 1998, 157 (Suppl 2), S71-S76, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The therapeutic goal of the currently available treatments for HCU, i.e., a restricted diet, pyridoxine, and/or betaine supplementation, is to reduce or normalize plasma Hcy levels because fluctuations and high levels of Hcy are often associated with serious complications, particularly thromboembolic events. See, Morris et al., Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. J Inherit Metab Dis 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Development of an alternative treatment, such as ERT, would reduce or eliminate reliance on dietary restrictions, which would allow HCU patients and their families access to a better quality of life. To achieve this therapeutic goal (i.e. the reduction or normalization of plasma levels of Hcy), the htCBS C15S variant has been previously modified with 20 kDa linear maleimide-activated PEG molecule and proof of concept was provided using murine models of HCU. See, Bublil et al., J Clin Invest 2016, 126, (6), 2372-84 and International application PCT/2016/061050, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.",
                                "There is a trend in PEGylation of therapeutic macromolecules from heterogeneous mixtures of conjugate isomers towards a single modified form, such as characterization/identification of the product and reproducibility of the manufacturing process. See, Pasut et al., J Control Release 2012, 161, (2), 461-72, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Modification of accessible Cys residues using maleimide PEG molecules is one of the most commonly used approaches for site selective PEGylation. Despite the mutagenesis of the most accessible cysteine residue 15 into serine (C15S) in htCBS, multiple PEGylated species were observed in addition to a fraction of an unmodified enzyme. See, Frank et al., Biochemistry 2006, 45, (36), 11021-9, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Although the individual species were chromatographically separable, such operation would certainly result in substantial losses and/or would likely render the process economically non-viable. Maleimide PEGylation of htCBS C15S was mapped to a peptide containing residues C272 and C275 with the former residue being a primary site for modification. Mutagenesis of either Cys residue would most likely increased reproducibility of PEGylation; however, substantial reduction in heme saturation and catalytic activity was anticipated.

                                "Similar strategy for PEGylation was employed in the development of an ERT for phenylketonuria based on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Unlike CBS described herein, the PAL is a tetrameric non-mammalian enzyme originating from cyanobacterial and fungal species. See, Sarkissian et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008, 105. (52), 20894-9, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Therefore, immunogenicity of such a foreign protein represented a substantial concern and various PEGylation protocols were tested with PAL. See, Gamez et al., Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 2005, 11, (6), 986-9, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. PAL was conjugated with NHS ester PEGs ranging from a linear 5 kDa up to a branched 40 kDa in size with linear 20 kDa PEG-PAL conjugates demonstrating increased performance and masking immunogenicity the best. Reduction of the PEG-PAL immunogenicity was directly proportional to the number of PEGs attached to the PAL subunit with gel-based estimate of 6-8 PEGs per PAL monomer suppressing the immune response most efficiently. See, Gamez et al.",
                                "When PEG-PAL was administered to the PKU mouse model, plasma phenylalanine levels were brought down to zero in short-term study and after overcoming an initial immune response also in a long-term study. See, Sarkissian et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2008, 105, (52), 20894-9, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The Hcy metabolism and pathophysiology need to be taken into an account. Unlike phenylalanine, Hcy is a redox-active thiol group-containing molecule existing in plasma in a variety of chemical forms (as fractions of total Hcy pool): thiolactone (<1%), free reduced (about 2%0/), disulfide (about 18%), and protein-bound (about 80%).

                                "Free Hcy is increased substantially to a 10-25% of total plasma Hcy in HCU. See, Mansoor et al., Metabolism 1993, 42, 1481-1485. In addition, Hcy, in homocystinuria, substantially replaces Cys bound to plasma albumin, what may contribute to decreased levels of plasma Cys found in HCU. See, Bar-Or et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2004, 325, (4), 1449-53, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Albumin is synthesized exclusively in the liver and its plasma concentration of 33-52 g/l in healthy human represents only about 40%, while the remaining about 60% of albumin stays in extravascular space. See, Boldt et al., Br J Anaesth 2010, 104, (3), 276-84, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In theory, only a free Hcy represents a substrate for CBS. Thus, the 50-80% decrease of total Hcy in HO mice upon continuous administration of 20NHS PEG-htCBS C15S may be explained by shifting the balance of metabolites in favor of free Hcy compared to other forms (disulfides and protein-bound). See, Bublil et al., J Clin Invest 2016, 126, (6), 2372-84 and International application PCT/2016/061050, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. 20NHS PEG-htCBS C15S in circulation serves as a \u201csink\u201d for excess of Hcy to improve the Hcy plasma levels. Possible reasons for failing to normalize levels could be the constant flux of intracellular Hcy (particularly from the liver as Hcy bound to a newly synthesized albumin), dynamic balance between intra- and extra-vascular Hcy pools (mediated mostly by albumin), and homocystinuria-induced pro-oxidative environment favoring disulfides and protein-bound forms of total Hcy pool. Nevertheless, recently published guidelines for diagnosis and management of HCU recommend keeping the plasma total of Hcy below 100 \u03bcM to prevent progress and/or occurrence of serious complications. See, Morris et al., Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. J Inherit Metab Dis 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Values are extrapolated from the results herein from homocystinuric HO mice fed with standard unrestricted chow containing 4-5 g Met per kg of diet (corresponds to 18-19% of protein). Administration of 20NHS PEG-htCBS C15S to human HCU patients results in guideline-recommended total Hcy levels in plasma without any additional treatment. Based on the results herein, a GLP-toxicology (GLP-tox) study in humans using 20NHS PEG-htCBS C15S as an ERT for HCU has been initiated."

The position of interest is then given the number assigned in the reference nucleic acid molecule. For example, if a particular polymorphism in Gene-X occurs at nucleotide 2073 of SEQ ID No. X, to identify the corresponding nucleotide in another allele or isolate, the sequences are aligned and then the position that lines up with 2073 is identified. Since various alleles may be of different length, the position designated 2073 may not be nucleotide 2073, but instead is at a position that \u201ccorresponds\u201d to the position in the reference sequence.",
                                "\u201cPercentage of sequence identity\u201d and \u201cpercentage homology\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to comparisons among polynucleotides and polypeptides, and are determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Alternatively, the percentage may be calculated by determining the number of positions at which either the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences or a nucleic acid base or amino acid residue is aligned with a gap to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Those of skill in the art appreciate that there are many established algorithms available to align two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted. e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol, 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Software Package), or by visual inspection (see generally, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., (1995 Supplement) (Ausubel)). Examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 and Altschul et al. (1977) Nucleic Acids Res. 3389-3402, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length \u201cW\u201d in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score \u201cT\u201d when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as, the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al, supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as \u201cseeds\u201d for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues: always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments: or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T. and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff& Henikoff. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)).",

                                "The term \u201cL or D form amino acids\u201d may be used in relation to the peptide described herein. As will be recognized by skilled artisans, the various Xn residues comprising the compounds of the invention may be in either the L- or D-configuration about their C\u03b1 carbons. In one embodiment, all the C\u03b1 carbons of a particular compound are in the same configuration. In some embodiments of the invention, the compounds comprise specific chiralities about one or more C\u03b1 carbon(s) and/or include non-peptide linkages at specified locations to impart the compound with specified properties. For example, it is well-known that peptides composed in whole or in part of D-amino acids are more resistant to proteases than their corresponding L-peptide counterparts. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds are peptides composed in whole or in part of D-amino acids. Alternatively, compounds having good stability against proteases may include peptide analogs including peptide linkages of reversed polarity at specified positions. For example, compounds having stability against tryptic-like proteases include peptide analogs having peptide linkages of reversed polarity before each L-Arg or L-Lys residue: compounds having stability against chymotrypsin-like proteases include peptide analogs having peptide linkages of reversed polarity before each small and medium-sized L-aliphatic residue or L-non-polar residue. In another embodiment, compounds having stability against proteases include peptide analogs composed wholly of peptide bonds of reversed polarity. Other embodiments having stability against proteases will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Additional specific embodiments of the compounds are described herein.",

                                "To understand the PEGylation patterns and to optimize the conjugation reaction to yield a more uniform modification, the individual PEG-htCBS C15S species were separated and the residues targeted with the ME-400MA maleimide PEG molecules were later identified (FIG. 2). First, the PEGylation reaction was loaded onto a DEAE Sepharose column equilibrated in a buffer with low conductivity and higher pH (10 mM TRIS.HCl pH 8.5) to enhance binding of all 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S species and ran on a shallow salt gradient (5%, 10-110 mM NaCl) to elute the protein. FIG. 2 shows a chromatogram of such a run and the recovery of two pools, which were subsequently analyzed along with an unmodified htCBS C15S and 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S reaction mixture on SDS-PAGE and native PAGE. Gel analysis of the pools provided evidence that the 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S consisted of at least 3 different PEG-htCBS C15S species.",
                                "Pool 1 (P1) was enriched in forms which had a weaker negative charge (FIG. 2) and more PEG moieties attached than those recovered in pool 2 (P2). The predominant 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S conjugate in P1 consisted of a dimeric htCBS C15S, where each protein was modified with ME-400MA to the same extent, most likely 2 PEGs per CBS dimer (homoPEGylated dimer). Moreover, P1 contained a minor 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S species with an additional 1 or 2 PEG moieties. On the other hand, the major 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S form of P2 contained a dimeric enzyme, where just one of the proteins was modified with PEG, i.e. 1 PEG per CBS dimer (hemiPEGylated dimer). Separation of individual 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S species enabled the identification of the sites of maleimide PEGylation using LC-MS.",
                                "For phase I, the unmodified htCBS C15S, P1 and P2 were digested with Lys-C. Results of LC-MS are shown in FIG. 3A, FIG. 3B, and FIG. 3C. Out of eight cysteine-containing peptides identified from the reduced/alkylated LC-MS peptide map, seven such peptides yielded similar relative abundances in all three samples indicating that these peptides were unlikely to have been PEGylated. Only one peptide (272-322; SEQ ID NO: 31) containing two cysteine residues (C272 and C275) showed a significant decrease in each of the two 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S species (P1 and P2).",

                                "The peptide recovery signifies that C272 is blocked, thus the lower yield of the 244-271 peptide in 400MA PEG-htCBS C15S forms signifies that C272 is the primary site for maleimide PEGylation. It is possible that both cysteine residues C272 and C275 are involved in the PEGylation of higher molecular weight species present in the low abundance in P1. Low NTCB digestion efficiency resulted in low abundance of the recovered peptides.",

First, modification of htCBS C15S was assessed with three NHS ester PEG molecules to determine their impact on enzyme activity. Four, three and two different PEG:CBS molar ratios were tested in PEGylations with 5, 10 and 20 kDa linear NHS ester PEG molecules, respectively. Unlike the site-selective maleimide PEGylation, the NHS ester PEG molecules yielded a reproducible mixture of highly modified isomers that were practically inseparable using SDS-PAGE as well as by native PAGE or SEC-HPLC.",

Partial separation was achieved only using NR-CE (FIG. 1), which served as a method for \u201cfingerprinting\u201d of the 20NHS PEG-htCBS C15S production batches.",
                                "While a 10-20-fold molar excess of PEG molecules to the CBS protein yielded NHS PEG-htCBS C15S species with only a slight effect on CBS activity, higher excess of PEG, such as 40- and 60-fold for 5 kDa and 40-fold for 10 kDa NHS PEG, resulted in a markedly reduced activity of the respective NHS PEG-htCBS C15S conjugates (FIG. 5). Thus, conjugation of htCBS C15S with either NHS PEG molecules in a PEGylation reaction with no more than 20-fold PEG:CBS molar excess yielded highly modified, bulky NHS PEG-htCBS C15S conjugates with essentially fully retained activity. PEGylation of htCBS C15S with lysine-targeting 5, 10 or 20 kDa NHS ester PEGs used in up to a 20-fold molar excess to htCBS C15S protein did not significantly affect the enzyme's specific activity (FIG. 5), a property shared with the maleimide PEGs (maleimide PEGylation data shown in Bublil et al., J Clin Invest 2016, 126, (6), 2372-84 and International application PCT/2016/061050, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties).",

Similarly, as done for the maleimide PEGs, the reproducibility of htCBS C15S PEGylation with 20NHS PEG (10-fold PEG:CBS molar excess) was assessed. Initial batches had a highly variable extent of PEGylation (data not shown). However, the main culprit of variability was identified as the residual ammonium sulfate in unmodified htCBS C15S. An extensive buffer exchange scheme was employed at the end of the chromatographic purification (15-20 diavolumes) to formulate the enzyme into the pre-PEGylation buffer, which resulted in a reproducible PEGylating pattern.",

Indeed, processing of the initial batches (for example LAB and 10L) yielded a large amount of unreacted PEG molecules carried over to the final product. Corrective measures, which included removal of 20% DMSO from the mixture, higher MWCO membrane cartridge for TFF unit (100 versus 30 kDa), 3-fold larger surface area and 2-fold dilution of the PEGylation mixture prior buffer exchange, all helped to reduce the viscosity and assisted in better clearance of free PEG molecules during the final formulation (TR1 and TR2).",

                                "The immunogenicity may stem from the trace amounts of unmodified enzyme or insufficiently masked htCBS C15S with site selective maleimide PEG molecule conjugation. Therefore, a complete absence of unmodified enzyme and more generous masking of potential immunogenic epitopes of PEG-htCBS C15S conjugate from the immune system by increased PEGylation would be expected to prevent the decrease in efficacy.",
