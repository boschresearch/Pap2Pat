                        "Personalized medicine providing therapies, adapted to each patient's genetic predisposition (Roses 2002; Roses 2002A; Roses 2002B; Willard 2012; Lutz et al., 2011), is supported by the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Roses 2000). SNPs are single base variations and besides copy number variations the most abundant type of genetic variation found between members of one species (Shi 2001, Syv\u00e4nen 2001; Venter et al., 2001). SNPs located in coding sequences can lead to structural and functional changes in the affected protein, enzymes or receptors. For example, the prothrombin G20210A mutation (PTM) is one of the most common genetic polymorphisms known to predispose to a first episode of venous thromboembolism (Marchiori et al., 2007). Most SNPs, however, are found in non-coding intergenic regions and often show no phenotypic effect. Intergenic SNPs present interesting markers for the determination of parentage (Hacia et al., 1999; Jorde et al., 2000), anthropology (Novembre et al., 2008; Schlebusch et al., 2012) or forensic tasks e.g. genetic fingerprinting. Many of these variations can affect predispositions for diseases or responses to drugs, chemicals and vaccines (Roses 2000; Kathiresan et al., 2009), which makes them especially interesting for pharmacogenomics (McCarthy and Hilfiker 2000; Relling and Dervieux 2001). The human genome project contributed to personalized medicine by identifying more than 2.4 million SNPs in 2001 (Lander et al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001). This created a basis for the first human haplotype map (HapMap) project with more than one million SNPs for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations (International HapMap Consortium 2005). In a second step additional 2.1 million SNPs were added (Frazer et al., 2007). Phase III could further improve the quality with an extended set of 1,184 samples from 11 populations (International HapMap Consortium 2010). With the 1000 Genomes Project, a validated haplotype map of 38 million SNPs was published in 2012 (Consortium T1GP 2012). Genomes of 1,092 individuals sampled from 14 populations drawn from Europe, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas were analysed through a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequence data, targeted deep exome sequence data and dense SNP genotype data (Consortium T1GP 2012).",
                        "It is most likely that SNP genotyping will be one of the future key technologies to diagnose these genetic variations between whole populations as well as in single patients. Different techniques can be used for the analysis of SNPs such as selective primer extension e.g. minisequencing (Pastinen et al., 2000; Syv\u00e4nen 1999; Wartiovaara and Syv\u00e4nen 2002), pyrosequencing (Ronaghi 2001) or allele specific amplification (ASA) (Myakishev et al., 2001; Pastinen et al., 2000; Shi, Bleavins and Ia iglesia 1999). Allele specific amplification (ASA) and selective primer extension (Pastinen et al., 2000) depend on the inefficient extension of a mismatched primer/template complex. Therefore highly selective DNA polymerases are urgently needed. Allele specific amplification through real-time PCR (ASA) allows detecting SNPs in a very efficient way. As unlike most other methods for SNP detection it does not require preliminary amplification of the target genetic material (Newton et al., 1989; Wu et al., 1989).",
                        "Another area of relevance is methylation-specific PCR (MSP). MSP is a widespread method used for the analysis of methylation patterns of cytosines at the C-5 position (5mC)\u2014the most abundant DNA modification in vertebrates. 5-Methylcytosine is an important epigenetic mark and has a crucial role for activating or silencing genes (Ehrlich and Wang 1981; Jones 2012; Dawson and Kouzarides 2012). Methylation patterns alter during development and carcinogenesis (Feltus et al., 2006). Alterations of epigenetic marks like DNA methylation play a crucial role in the onset of diseases like cancer and therefore are important early stage cancer biomarkers (Dawson and Kouzarides 2012; Feltus et al., 2006, Heichmann and Warren 2012; Heyn and Esteller 2012; Deng, Liu and Du 2012). In general, it appears that the detection of epigenetic alterations is a promising and emerging tool for cancer diagnostics, prognostics, and prediction of response to therapies that awaits broad application in the future. In combination with genetic mutation analysis, epigenetic analysis will result in a very powerful approach along these lines for early diagnostics of cancer and other diseases such as neuro-developmental and metabolic disorders as well as auto-immune diseases (Heyn and Esteller 2012; Deng, Liu and Du 2012; Deng, Liu and Du 2010).",
                        "MSP, as well ASA, is a very cost-effective method that does not require specialized equipment and can be performed in almost any laboratory. Selectivity is the most important factor in ASA and MSP and can be increased by the use of modified primer probes (Strerath et al., 2002; Strerath and Marx 2005; Johnson 2004) or by the employment of mutated DNA polymerases possessing a higher mismatch extension selectivity as compared to the wild type enzyme. A selective polymerase would enable reliable ASA and MSP without the need of any substrate modifications and can thus be the most cost and work efficient solution.",
                        "Several DNA polymerases with increased DNA replication fidelity are known (Suzuki et al., 2000), e.g. for the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and the thermostable Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase (Summerer et al., 2005) or the Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) DNA polymerase (Biles and Connolly 2004). It is known that the exchange of amino acids, affecting the interaction between polymerase and primer/template complex or the binding pocket's geometry, can lead to a change in selectivity of DNA polymerases (Kunkel and Bebenek 2000). In previous studies for instance, an increase in Taq DNA polymerase selectivity by changing the polar amino acids Q and H (Gln, and His) of motif C into two unipolar amino acids (Q to L and H to L) was achieved. Motif C is highly conserved in the palm domain within the family A, B, X and Y polymerases and plays a role in the identification of mismatched bases in the primer/template complex (Loh and Loeb 2005; Franklin, Wang and Streitz 2001). While discovered with Taq DNA polymerase, a member of family A, in further studies (Rudinger, Kranaster and Marx 2007) this concept to increase mismatch extension selectivity could be transferred to the B family Pfu DNA polymerase. The respective amino acids are found in the highly conserved motives YGDTD and KXY in eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea and viruses (Blasco et al., 1995).",
                        "Along this line, WO 2005/074350 describes DNA polymerases of the family A, with increased mismatch discrimination and therefore increased selectivity.",

                        "Therefore, the technical problem underlying the present invention can be seen in the provision of alternative DNA polymerases with increased mismatch discrimination. In other words, the DNA polymerases of the present invention have increased selectivity.",
                        "The technical problem is solved by the embodiments reflected in the claims, described in the description, and illustrated in the Examples and Figures.",
                        "Surprisingly, it has been found that by mutation of basic amino acids (arginine and lysine) that are in direct contact to the phosphate backbone of the primer strand in the closed conformation of the Klenow fragment of the Taq polymerase (KlenTaq) leads to the generation of DNA polymerases with advantageous properties which make the DNA polymerases of the present invention particularly suitable for, e.g. various diagnostic applications.",
                        "Specifically, the present inventors demonstrated that the selectivity of a DNA polymerase can be altered by substituting a polar amino acid residue that interacts with the backbone of the primer strand. They identified interesting mutants with increased mismatch selectivity for each examined amino acid position.",
                        "More specifically, the present inventors found that the DNA polymerase mutants described herein are suitable for diagnostic purposes, while, however, uses of the DNA polymerases described herein are not limited to diagnostic purposes. By way of example, the inventors selected the mutant (R660V) which showed best performance on genomic DNA templates to demonstrate its high mismatch selectivity. In order to further speed up detection, the inventors set-up a multiplexing assay with both allele-specific primers present in one reaction followed by an allele-identification melting curve readout. With this the SNP detection is possible in one single reaction well, as at least the presence of one allele-specific amplificate is serving as a positive control indicating both a sufficient template quality and polymerase activity. Hence, multiplexing applications are a preferred embodiment of the methods and uses of the present invention. Additionally, in particular KlenTaq R660V is able to perform ASA in the presence of whole blood sample with no previous DNA purification. This fast and easy system allows SNP genotyping in multiwell format in less than two hours with minimal costs, circumventing time and cost intensive sample preparations. However, the present invention also provides other DNA polymerase mutants that have similar or even identical properties like KlenTaq R660V. Finally they could show that the DNA polymerases described herein, in particular, KlenTaq R660V, is suitable for MSP.",

The directionality of the newly forming strand (the daughter strand) is opposite to the direction in which DNA polymerase moves along the template strand. The term \u201cDNA polymerase\u201d as used herein includes DNA polymerases that have been modified by e.g. natural process such as posttranslational processing, or non-natural process such as chemical modification. Such modifications can occur on the peptide backbone, amino acid side chains, or the N- or C-terminus. Modifications include e.g. acetylations, acylations, ADP-ribosylations, amidations, covalent attachment of flavines, haem-groups, nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives, lipids or lipid derivatives, cyclizations, disulfide bridges, methylations and demethylations, cystine linkages, formylations, \u03b3-carboxylations, glycosylations, hydroxylations, phosphorylations and the tRNA-mediated addition of amino acids.",
                        "A polymerase can generally experimentally be analyzed by two types of reactions, first the steady state kinetic measurements and second the pre-steady state kinetic methods. The steady state measurements give an impression on the kinetic parameter KM (Michealis-Menten constant) and Vmax or Kcat (maximal velocity of reaction; kcat=Vmax/c(enzyme)). This reaction is generating a mean over the whole reaction from binding of the primer/template or target sequence complex to the implementation of the nucleotide. This reaction has to be taking place under single completed hit conditions, so that every primer/template complex is maximally hit one time by the DNA polymerase so that the generated data only mirror the conversion mediated by the DNA polymerase and not the conversion mediated by many DNA polymerases on one template. In real experiments this objective is achieved by mixing a template in excess in relation to the enzyme and a maximal implementation rate of 20% of the primers (Creighton, Bloom and Goodman 1995; Boosalis, Petruska and Goodman 1987). In the pre-steady state kinetic methods (stopped flow or quench flow) single turnover conditions are generated so that the influence of association and dissociation does not affect the kinetic parameters. Here an excess of the enzyme in relation to the substrate are mixed, such that every primer/template or target sequence complex is occupied with a polymerase. Then the reaction is initiated by the addition of dNTPs and stopped within a short period of time (rapid quench flow) or is monitored during the course of the reaction via fluorescence methods (stopped flow). In this way the kinetic parameters of the affinity of the dNTP to the polymerase-DNA complex (KD) and the maximal implementation rate (kpol) can be determined (Johnson 1993; Bryant, Johnson and Benkovic 1983).",

T. aquaticus is a bacterium that lives in hot springs and hydrothermal vents, and Taq polymerase was identified as an enzyme able to withstand the protein-denaturing conditions (high temperature) required during PCR (Chien, Edgar and Trela 1976). Taq's optimum temperature for activity is 75-80\u00b0 C., with a half-life of greater than 2 hours at 92.5\u00b0 C., 40 minutes at 95\u00b0 C. and 9 minutes at 97.5\u00b0 C., and can replicate a 1000 base pair strand of DNA in less than 10 seconds at 72\u00b0 C.

The more positive the value, the more hydrophobic are the amino acids located in that region of the protein. The most common method of measuring amino acid hydrophobicity is partitioning between two immiscible liquid phases. Nozaki and Tanford proposed a hydrophobicity scale for nine amino acids (Nozaki and Tanford, 1971). Two scales have been developed using micellar phases (Fendler, Nome and Nagyvary 1975; Leodidas and Hatton 1990).

A differential solvent accessible surface area hydrophobicity scale based on proteins as compacted networks near a critical point, due to self-organization by evolution, was constructed based on asymptotic power-law (self-similar) behavior (Moret and Zebende, 2007; Phillips 2009). This scale is based on a bioinformatic survey of 5526 high-resolution structures from the Protein Data Bank. Reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is a chromatographic method for measuring solute hydrophobicity (Kallol et al., 2003; Hodges et al., 1994).",

Evol. 36 (1993), 290-300; Altschul, J. Mol. Biol. 215 (1990), 403-410), can be used to search for local sequence alignments. BLAST produces alignments of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences to determine sequence similarity. Because of the local nature of the alignments, BLAST is especially useful in determining exact matches or in identifying similar sequences. The fundamental unit of BLAST algorithm output is the High-scoring Segment Pair (HSP). An HSP consists of two sequence fragments of arbitrary but equal lengths whose alignment is locally maximal and for which the alignment score meets or exceeds a threshold or cutoff score set by the user. The BLAST approach is to look for HSPs between a query sequence and a database sequence, to evaluate the statistical significance of any matches found, and to report only those matches which satisfy the user-selected threshold of significance. The parameter E establishes the statistically significant threshold for reporting database sequence matches. E is interpreted as the upper bound of the expected frequency of chance occurrence of an HSP (or set of HSPs) within the context of the entire database search. Any database sequence whose match satisfies E is reported in the program output.",

A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set at minimum slightly above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold (crossing) cycle (Ct) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle (Cq). The threshold is either manually selected or auto-selected to fall several standard deviations above baseline fluorescence and below the plateau phase, where the amplification begins to attenuate. Typically, the threshold is adjusted to the mid-point of the exponential phase of the PCR, at a location suitable for all samples in the experiment. The CT or c(t) (cycles to threshold) value for a given reaction is defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence emission intersects the fixed threshold. For example, SYBR Green I and fluorescent probes can be used in real-time PCR for template DNA quantification. Fluorescence from each sample is collected once each cycle during PCR, and plotted against the cycle number. The starting template concentration correlates inversely to the time of first appearance of fluorescence signal.

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms may fall within coding sequences of genes, non-coding regions of genes, or in the intergenic regions (regions between genes). SNPs within a coding sequence do not necessarily change the amino acid sequence of the protein that is produced, due to degeneracy of the genetic code. SNPs in the coding region are of two types, synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs. Synonymous SNPs do not affect the protein sequence while nonsynonymous SNPs change the amino acid sequence of protein. The nonsynonymous SNPs are of two types: missense and nonsense. SNPs that are not in protein-coding regions may still affect gene splicing, transcription factor binding, messenger RNA degradation, or the sequence of non-coding RNA.

This amplification can be across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. Almost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase or KlenTaq. The DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from nucleotides, by using single-stranded DNA as a template and oligonucleotides (also called primers), which are required for initiation of DNA synthesis. Typically, the primers are designed as such that they hybridize to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 boarders of the target sequence. In the first step, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called DNA melting. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the two DNA strands become templates for the DNA polymerase to selectively amplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers that are complementary to the DNA region targeted for amplification under specific thermal cycling conditions. The amplicons generated by PCR can then be analyzed e.g. on an agarose gel.",

Data is therefore collected throughout the PCR process, rather than at the end of the PCR. In real-time PCR, reactions are characterized by the point in time during cycling when amplification of a target is first detected rather than the amount of target accumulated after a fixed number of cycles. There are two main methods used to perform quantitative PCR: dye-based and probe-based detection. Both methods rely on calculating the initial (zero cycle) DNA concentration by extrapolating back from a reliable fluorescent signal. The basic principle of this method is known in the art (Arya et al. 2005).",
                        "The term \u201cmultiplex\u201d refers to amplification with more than one set of primers, or the amplification of more than one polymorphism site in a single reaction.",

Thus, an ARMS primer can be designed to amplify a specific member of a multi-allelic system while remaining refractory to amplification of another allele that may differ by as little as a single base from the former.",
                        "An \u201callele specific amplification through real time PCR\u201d allows detecting SNPs in a very efficient way. As unlike most other methods for SNP detection it does not require preliminary amplification of the target genetic material (Newton et al., 1989; Wu et al., 1989). ASA combines amplification and detection in a single reaction, based on the discrimination of matched and mismatched primer/target sequence complexes. The increase of amplified DNA during the reaction can be monitored in real-time by the increase of a fluorescence signal caused by a dye e.g. SYBRGreen I (Wilhelm and Pingoud 2003) emitting upon binding to double-stranded DNA. The match case comprises a correct Watson-Crick base pair at the 3\u2032-primer end, whereas the mismatch case features a non-canonical base pair. The mismatch should result in less efficient or, at best, no product amplification (Wu et al., 1989; Germer and Higuchi 1999; Germer, Holland and Higuchi 2000; Guo, Liu and Smith 1997; Ishikawa et al., 1995; Shively et al., 2003; Wilhelm et al., 2002). The in real-time followed ASA reflects this with a delayed or absent fluorescence signal for the mismatch case. In SNP diagnostics this provides information about the absence or presence of a SNP. In one embodiment, one allelic primer can have a 30-nucleotide overhanging sequence at its 5\u2032 end. In another embodiment, both alleles can be detected in the same reaction e.g. according to their different melting temperatures.",

A non-allele-specific control amplicon is amplified by 2 common (outer) primers flanking the mutation region. Two allele-specific (inner) primers are designed in opposite orientation to the common primers and, in combination with the common primers, can simultaneously amplify both the wild-type and the mutant amplicons. As a result, the 2 allele-specific amplicons have different lengths and can be easily separated by standard gel electrophoresis because the mutation is asymmetrically located with respect to the common (outer) primers. The control amplicon provides an internal control with respect to false negatives as well as amplification failure and at least 1 of the 2 allele-specific amplicons are always present in T-ARMS-PCR (Piccoli et al., 2006).",

Different techniques have been developed, which are known to the skilled artesian (see e.g. Gill and Ghaemi 2008). Examples of isothermal amplification include transcription mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid based amplification (NASBA), signal mediated amplification of RNA technology (SMART), strand displacement amplification (SDA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), isothermal multiple displacement amplification (IMDA), helicase-dependent amplification (HAD), single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA). The temperature used in the isothermal amplification can be between room temperature (22-24\u00b0 C.) to about 65\u00b0 C., or it can be between about 60-65\u00b0 C., between 45-50\u00b0 C., between 37-42\u00b0 C. or room temperature of 22-24\u00b0 C. The product that results from the isothermal amplification can be detected by gel electrophoresis, ELISA, ELOSA (Enzyme linked oligosorbent assay), Real-time PCR, ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence), bioanalyzer, which is a chip-based capillary electrophoresis machine to analyze RNA, DNA, and protein or turbidity. RGA and HAD are also suitable for multiplex amplification.",

MSP is a widespread method used for the analysis of methylation patterns of cytosines at the C-5 position (5mC)\u2014the most abundant DNA modification in vertebrates. Several methods for detection of DNA methylation alterations are known and are employed. The most common approaches to obtain single base resolution are based on \u2018bisulfite treatment\u2019 of the genomic DNA sample. By bisulfite treatment cytosine (C) is converted to uracil while 5mC remains unchanged (Hayatsu et al., 1970). In MSP, after bisulfite treatment the DNA sample is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while primer pairs are chosen which span the CpG site. Hereby, one primer pair is designed for unmethylated DNA and the other primer pair for methylated DNA. Due to conversion of C into uracil, a mismatched primer prevents efficient PCR amplification and, optimally, only amplification from methylated DNA will occur (Kristensen, Hansen 2009).",
                        "Thus, in one embodiment, the target sequence is a DNA sequence that has been treated with bisulfite.

This could be an external positive control, which is a separate sample containing the control template. Such external control reactions can help detect when a reaction fails due to cycler or reaction component problems or when an inhibitor is suppressing the reaction. Alternatively, an internal positive control (IPC) can be used. To run a reaction with an IPC, the template and primers for the control target are included in the reaction along with those for the target of interest. The control target should of course be easily distinguished (by electrophoretic migration or Tm) from the target of interest. IPCs are useful because they can pinpoint problems that are intrinsic to the sample reaction. In one embodiment, the control is a internal positive control or external positive control. In another embodiment, the control is a external control. In another embodiment, the control is an internal control.

However, none of the mutants show product formation for the mismatch case after 10 min but full-length product for the match case.

In case of the KlenTaq wt only the 3\u2032-terminal mismatched primer (P primer) is discriminated, the distal match vs. mismatches using the P+3 or the P+6 primers do not result in any significant conversion differences. In contrary, many of the mutants for instance R536K and K508W show enhanced short-term memories (See FIGS. 8 C and D), thus a clear difference in conversion rates is detectible even if the primers P+3 and P+6 are used.
