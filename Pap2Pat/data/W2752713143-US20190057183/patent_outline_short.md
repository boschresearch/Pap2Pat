# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- define technical field

## BACKGROUND

- motivate genetic interactions

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
- motivate genetic interactions in GWAS
- describe between pathway model (BPM) and within pathway model (WPM)
- illustrate BPM and WPM with example pathways
- outline method for detecting interactions and predicting phenotypes
- describe data processing and quality control operations
- explain construction of mutation-mutation interaction networks
- detail testing for BPM or WPM enrichment of SNP-SNP pair interactions
- estimate interactions between mutations using logistic regression and hypergeometric tests
- define hygeSSI measure
- compute interaction networks
- test pathway-pathway interactions
- estimate false discovery rate
- prioritize disease model and interaction threshold
- validate discovered interactions
- analyze within-pathway models
- discover SNP-SNP hub pathways
- characterize statistical power of approach

### EXAMPLES

- introduce example 1: discovery of between-pathway interactions in a Parkinson's disease cohort
- describe application of BridGE to identify between pathway interactions
- report results of BridGE analysis, including pathway-pathway interactions and SNP-SNP interactions
- introduce example 2: evidence for within-pathway interaction structures in Parkinson's disease
- introduce example 3: replication of pathway-level interactions in an independent Parkinson's disease cohort
- report results of replication analysis, including validation of BPM and WPM interactions
- motivate genetic interaction analysis
- describe BridGE approach
- apply BridGE to multiple diseases
- discuss results and implications
- simulate detection limits for pathway-level interactions
- describe machine architecture for executing BridGE
- define modules and machine readable media
- discuss network communication and incorporation by reference

### Additional Embodiments

- define computer implemented methods
- describe non-transitory machine readable medium
- outline system and method for detecting disease
