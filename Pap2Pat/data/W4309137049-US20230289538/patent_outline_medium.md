- generate training seed set
- train first language model
- describe first language model
- generate synthetically generated code-switched utterances
- associate labels with synthetically generated code-switched utterances
- collect synthetically generated code-switched utterances
- train semantic parser
- describe semantic parser
- introduce method 400
- select first training example
- describe first training example
- translate first text sequence
- describe trained first language model
- generate second parsing data
- generate second training example
- determine remaining first training examples
- select next first training example
- introduce method 500
- generate third parsing data
- describe third parsing data
- convert semantic tags to generic identifiers
- generate parsed code-switched utterance
- generate third parsing data based on second parsing data
- end method
- define third parsing data
- associate identifiers with semantic tags
- include third parsing data in second training example
- generate training set from second training examples
- train second semantic parser
- break training set into batches
- perform back-propagation steps
- configure second semantic parser
- filter training set based on span counts
- determine number of spans associated with identifier
- exclude second training example from training set
- filter training set based on identifier lists
- determine lists of identifiers
- exclude second training example from training set
- train second semantic parser
