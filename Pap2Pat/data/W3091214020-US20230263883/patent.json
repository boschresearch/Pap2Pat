Among the strains that infect humans are the alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and the beta-coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which cause common colds (FIG. 1A). Three additional beta-coronavirus species result in much more severe infections in humans: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for an outbreak in Asia in 2003 which resulted in \u02dc8000 infections and over 800 deaths (2); Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in 2012 and resulted in \u22122500 infections and over 800 deaths (3); and SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 in Asia and quickly spread throughout the globe (4). As of early June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had caused over 9 million confirmed infections and was responsible for over 475,000 deaths (5)."

Kinetics of induction and variation in epitope selection were observed over time in recently-infected individuals. A machine learning model was developed, trained on VirScan data to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with very high sensitivity and specificity. VirScan identified public epitopes that are specific to SARS-CoV-2, and we employed these in a rapid Luminex assay to distinguish recently-infected COVID-19 patients from controls. Finally, VirScan enabled us to examine the history of previous viral infections and to determine correlates of COVID-19 outcomes.",

The identification of binding sites of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provides a stepping stone to the isolation and functional dissection of both neutralizing antibodies and antibodies that might exacerbate patient outcomes through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

                        "The clinical course of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19)\u2014the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2014is notable for its extreme variability: while some individuals remain entirely asymptomatic, others experience fever, anosmia, diarrhea, severe respiratory distress, pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, blood clotting disorders, liver and kidney distress, enhanced cytokine release and, in a small percentage of cases, death (6). Understanding the factors influencing this spectrum of outcomes is therefore an intense area of research. Disease severity is correlated with advanced age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and co-morbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, obesity, and reduced immune function (6). Additional relevant factors are likely to include the inoculum of virus at infection, the individual's genetic background and viral exposure history. The complex interplay of these elements also determines how individuals respond to therapies aimed at mitigating disease severity. One of the key aspects of human physiology that integrates many of these components is the functionality of the immune system. The immune system is the primary defense against the virus. The outcome of any individual's encounter with the virus is thus dependent on the functionality of the immune system, which depends on a number of factors including genetics, stress, age and the history of prior exposures. Detailed knowledge of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 could improve our understanding of diverse outcomes and inform the development of improved diagnostics vaccines, and antibody-based therapies.",

The genome comprises or flab encoding or flab polyproteins, genes encoding structural proteins including surface (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid N proteins, and 6 accessory proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 genes (Khailany et al., Gene Rep. 2020 June; 19: 100682; Wang et al., J Med Virol. 2020 June; 92(6):667-674.

Cohorts of COVID-19 patients, pre-COVID-19 era negative controls, and longitudinal samples from COVID-19 patients over the course of infection enabled us to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies as well as cross-reacting antibodies. These cross-reacting antibodies can confound serological diagnosis of COVID-19. VirScan can also identify virus-specific epitopes that allow one to discriminate between different coronavirus infections. We developed a machine learning model trained on VirScan data that detects SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with extremely high sensitivity and specificity, and we employed the most differentially-recognized SARS-CoV-2 peptides between COVID-19+ patients and pre-COVID-19 era controls in a Luminex assay to produce a fast and reliable diagnostic. We compared the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and virome-wide exposure history in COVID-19 patients who did or did not require hospitalization in order to identify correlates of disease severity. Finally, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis coupled with VirScan to map epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome to single amino acid resolution; over a dozen of these epitopes are located in the receptor binding (RBD) of the spike, and 10 of these are located on the receptor binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2 and are likely targets of neutralizing antibodies.",
                        "Using VirScan, we were able to map a total of over 3,000 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, including 813 unique epitopes, with unprecedented resolution. Further, we were able to investigate their cross-reactivity with other human and bat coronavirus epitopes."

                                "Antibody profiling of sera from 232 COVID-19 patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls revealed robust antibody recognition of peptides encoded by SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients compared with controls. These were primarily directed against the S and N proteins, with significant cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV, and milder cross-reactivity with the more distantly related MERS-CoV and the seasonal Human coronaviruses (HCoVs). Cross-reactive responses to SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 were frequently detected in pre-COVID-19 era controls, suggesting that these result from antibodies induced by other pathogens.",
                                "Examination of the response at the epitope level revealed the existence of public epitopes targeted by many COVID-19 patients. Using a combination of both 56-mer and 20-mer peptide tiles, together with the alanine scanning mutagenesis library, we mapped epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 at unprecedented resolution.",
                                "At the population level, most SARS-CoV-2 epitopes were recognized by both IgA and IgG antibodies. We found individuals often exhibited a \u201ccheckerboard\u201d pattern, utilizing either IgG or IgA antibodies against a given epitope. This suggests that a given IgM clone often evolves into either an IgG or an IgA antibody, potentially influenced by local signals, and that, within an individual, there may often be a largely monoclonal response to a given epitope.",
                                "Examination of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 at the epitope level using the triple-alanine scanning mutagenesis library revealed 145 epitopes in S, 116 in N, and 562 across the remainder of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (FIGS. 11A-H). These epitopes ranged from private to highly public, with one public epitope cluster being recognized by 79% of COVID-19 patients (the S 811-830 region, see FIG. 6 C/D third panel from the left). Triple-alanine scanning mutagenesis showed highly conserved antibody footprints for some epitope clusters and diverse antibody footprints for others, indicating varying levels of conservation at the antibody-epitope interface among individuals (FIGS. 10A-F). Peptides containing public epitopes could be used to isolate and clone antibodies from B-cells bearing antigen-specific BCRs. If these antibodies are found to lack protective effects or have deleterious effects, these regions, e.g. S 811-830, could be mutated in future vaccines to divert the immunological response to other regions of S that might have more protective effects. Epitopes also varied in cross-reactivity, which can be explained by the presence or absence of sequence conservation between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 at these regions. Antibodies against several conserved epitopes in HCoVs seemed to be anamnestically boosted in COVID-19 patients. Altogether these data help explain why many serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 produce false positives, and should be taken as a cautionary note for those trying to develop such assays."

To this end, we compared cohorts of COVID-19 patients who had (H) or had not (NH) required hospitalization. Using both VirScan and the COVID-19 Luminex assay, we noticed a striking and somewhat counterintuitive increase in recognition of peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins among the H group, with more extensive epitope spreading. Whether this is a cause or a consequence of severe disease is not clear. Individuals whose innate and adaptive immune responses are not able to quell the infection early may experience a higher viral antigen load, a prolonged period of antibody evolution and epitope spreading. Consequently, these patients might develop stronger and broader antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and could be more likely to have hyperinflammatory reactions such as cytokine storms that increase the probability of hospitalization. We noticed that hospitalized males had stronger antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 than hospitalized females. This may indicate that males in this group are less able to control the virus soon after infection and is consistent with reported differences in disease outcomes for males and females. The presence of antibodies that bind to these epitopes (in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein) can be used to identify subjects who are likely to have a more severe response.",
                                "VirScan also allowed us to examine viral exposure history, which revealed two striking correlations. First, the seroprevalence of CMV and HSV-1 was much greater in the H group compared to the NH group. The demographic differences in our relatively small cohort of H versus NH COVID-19 patients make it impossible for us to determine with certainty if CMV or HSV-1 infection impacts disease outcome or is simply associated with other covariates such as age, race and socioeconomic status. While CMV prevalence does slightly increase with age after 40 (31), its prevalence also differs greatly among ethnic and socioeconomic groups (32). CMV is a herpes virus that exhibits latency within the host and is known to have a profound impact on the immune system; it can skew the naive T-cell repertoire (33), decrease T and B cell function (34), and is associated with higher systemic levels of inflammatory mediators (35, 36). CMV latency also results in inversion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell numbers, poor proliferation response of T-cells, low B cell numbers, and has been associated with increased mortality of people over 65 years of age (37). CMV's effects on the immune system could potentially impact the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in an older population. The effects of CMV on the immune system could impact COVID-19 outcomes.",
                                "The second striking correlation we observed was a significant decrease in the levels of antibodies targeting ubiquitous viruses such as Rhinoviruses, Enteroviruses, and Influenza viruses, in COVID-19 H patients compared with NH patients. When we examined only the CMV+ or HSV-1+ individuals in the two groups, we found that the strength of the antibody response to CMV and HSV-1 peptides was also reduced in the H group. We examined the effects of age on viral antibody levels in a pre-COVID-19 era cohort and found a diminution with age in the antibody response against viral peptides differentially recognized between the H and NH groups, consistent with previous studies on the effects of aging on the immune system (38). This inferred reduced immunity during aging could impact the severity of COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, the presence of decreased levels antibodies to CMV and/or HSV-1 epitopes can be used to identify subjects who are likely to have a more severe response.",
                                "In correlative analyses such as these, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions about causality given the demographical differences in the NH vs H groups. The NH group is younger, has a higher percentage of Caucasian individuals, and has more females (average age 42, 66% female) versus H (average age 58, 42% female). This is consistent with the well-documented age, race and sex differences among the more severely affected individuals (25, 26). However, even if age and other demographic factors are covariates, the reduction in immune function with age and CMV status described here could still impact severity of infection."

Basically, the process involves obtaining antibody-secreting immune cells (lymphocytes) from the spleen of a mammal (e.g., mouse) that has been previously immunized with the antigen of interest (e.g., a neutralizing epitope antigen) either in vivo or in vitro. The antibody-secreting lymphocytes are then fused with myeloma cells or transformed cells that are capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture, thereby producing an immortal, immunoglobulin-secreting cell line. The resulting fused cells, or hybridomas, are cultured, and the resulting colonies screened for the production of the desired monoclonal antibodies. Colonies producing such antibodies are cloned, and grown either in vivo or in vitro to produce large quantities of antibody. A description of the theoretical basis and practical methodology of fusing such cells is set forth in Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975), which is hereby incorporated by reference.",

J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976), which is hereby incorporated by reference). This immortal cell line, which is preferably murine, but can also be derived from cells of other mammalian species, including but not limited to rats and humans, is selected to be deficient in enzymes necessary for the utilization of certain nutrients, to be capable of rapid growth, and to have good fusion capability. Many such cell lines are known to those skilled in the art, and others are regularly described.",

Typically, such antibodies can be raised by administering the protein or polypeptide of the present invention subcutaneously to New Zealand white rabbits that have first been bled to obtain pre-immune serum. The antigens can be injected at a total volume of 100:1 per site at six different sites. Each injected material will contain synthetic surfactant adjuvant pluronic polyols, or pulverized acrylamide gel containing the protein or polypeptide after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rabbits are then bled two weeks after the first injection and periodically boosted with the same antigen three times every six weeks. A sample of serum is then collected 10 days after each boost. Polyclonal antibodies are then recovered from the serum by affinity chromatography using the corresponding antigen to capture the antibody. Ultimately, the rabbits are euthanized, e.g., with pentobarbital 150 mg/Kg IV. This and other procedures for raising polyclonal antibodies are disclosed in E. Harlow, et. al., editors, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual (1988).",

For example, solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, intramuscular, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.",

For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL\u2122 (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.",

Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.",

We created \u02dc200 nt oligos encoding peptide sequences 56 AAs in length, tiled with 28-amino acid overlap through the proteomes of all coronaviruses known to infect humans including HCov-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 as well as three closely related bat viruses: BatCoV-Rp3, BatCoV-HKU3 and BatCoV-279. For SARS-CoV-2 we included a number of coding variants available in early sequencing of the viruses. For SARS-CoV-2 we additionally made a 20 AA tiling library with 15-AA overlap. Additionally, for SARS-CoV-2 we made triple-mutant sequences scanning through all 56-mer peptides. Non-alanine AAs were mutated to alanine, and alanines were mutated to glycine. We reverse-translated the peptide sequences into DNA sequences that were codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, that lacked restriction sites used in downstream cloning steps (EcoRI and XhoI), and that were unique in the 50 nt at the 5\u2032 end to allow for unambiguous mapping of the sequencing results. Then we added adapter sequences to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends to form the final oligonucleotide sequences. Adapter sequences were added to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends to facilitate downstream PCR and cloning steps. Different adapters were added to each sub-library so that they could be amplified separately. The resulting sequences were synthesized on a releasable DNA microarray (Agilent). We PCR-amplified the DNA oligo library with the primers shown below, digested the product with EcoRI and XhoI, and cloned it into the EcoRI/SalI site of the T7FNS2 vector (Larman et al., 2011). We packaged the resultant library into T7 bacteriophage using the T7 Select Packaging Kit (EMD Millipore) and amplified the library according to the manufacturer's protocol."

For each position in the 56-mer, the relative enrichment for each amino-acid was calculated as the mean fold-change of the three mutant peptides containing an alanine-mutation at that location relative to the median fold-change of all alanine mutants for the 56-mer. Overlapping 56-mers were combined by taking the minimum value at each shared position to account for the possibility that an epitope is disrupted in one of the tiles by the peptide junction. To map epitopes from the alanine-scanning data for each sample we used the HMMlearn python package to develop a three-state Hidden-Markov model (HMM) assuming a gaussian distribution of relative-enrichment emissions for each state. Mapped epitopes smaller than 5 amino acids were removed from the subsequent analysis. Next, we performed two-step hierarchical clustering procedure to identify the number of unique epitopes. First, for each protein all of the epitopes identified across the 169 COVID-19+ patients were clustered based on the start and stop locations predicted by the HMM classifier to generate a set of positional clusters we refer to as hotspots. Next, to identify unique epitopes within each hotspot we performed an additional step of hierarchical clustering on the samples with epitopes within each hotspot based on the alanine-scanning relative-enrichment values within the hotspot region (FIGS. 10A-F). The total number of unique epitopes for each protein was taken as the number of distinct epitope groupings following clustering on both epitope location and the motif of relative-enrichments values within the hotspot region."

In the first step, beads were incubated with 20 uL of plasma samples (1:300 dilution). Samples used for the classifier were diluted 1:100, samples used to compare disease severity were diluted 1:300.

In order to interrogate the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), we supplemented this library with additional oligonucleotides encoding peptides that span the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 itself, plus the proteomes of the six human coronaviruses and the three bat coronaviruses that are most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 (FIG. 1A) (11,12). These additional oligonucleotides were composed of three sub-libraries. Sublibrary 1 encoded a 56 amino acid peptide library that tiles every 28 amino acids through each of the open reading frames (ORFs) expressed by the 10 coronavirus species (FIG. 1B); sublibrary 2 encoded 20 amino acid peptides tiling every 5 amino acids across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, thereby permitting more precise delineation of epitopes; and sublibrary 3 comprised triple alanine scanning mutants of the 56-mer peptides tiling across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, enabling epitopes to be mapped at amino acid resolution.",

Some of the cohorts included longitudinal samples, with patients tracked for several weeks following an initial sample taken at either the time of symptom onset or point of hospital entry. (For simplicity, we will refer to all individuals who have experienced COVID-19 as COVID-19 patients.) Our cohorts also included a diverse set of control sera collected prior to the outbreak of COVID-19; to facilitate the identification of epitopes specific to other HCoVs, these included a cohort of young children experiencing HCoV infections for the first time.

These pre-COVID-19 era controls facilitate identification of (1) SARS-CoV-2 peptides encoding epitopes specific to COVID-19 patients and (2) SARS-CoV-2 peptides encoding epitopes that are cross-reactive with antibodies developed in response to the ubiquitous common-cold HCoVs. Sera from COVID-19 patients exhibited much more SARS-CoV-2 reactivity compared to pre-COVID-19 era controls (FIGS. 1D-E).

Extensive cross-reactivity was also observed against peptides derived from the three bat coronaviruses that share the greatest sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 (FIGS. 1A, 1D-E) (11). We know that these represent cross-reactivities as, given the low prevalence and circumscribed geographical location of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of the individuals in this study are likely to have encountered these viruses.",

This could be due to the elicitation of novel antibodies that cross-react, or to an anamnestic response boosting B cell memory against HCoVs. The converse is not always true: many pre-COVID-19 era samples exhibit strong recognition of seasonal HCoV peptides but little or no recognition of SARS-CoV-2 peptides (FIG. 1D), although one caveat may be that the concentrations of antibodies against seasonal HCoVs may be below the threshold of detection in the pre-COVID-19 era samples.",

These two proteins exhibit significant differential recognition by sera from COVID-19 patients versus pre-COVID-19 era controls, indicating that their recognition is a result of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. Third-most frequently recognized is the replicase polyprotein ORF1, but, unlike S and N, ORF1 is recognized to a similar extent by sera from COVID-19 patients and pre-COVID-19 era controls. This suggests that recognition of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 is a result of cross-reactions from antibodies elicited by exposure to other pathogens, possibly HCoVs. Antibody responses to peptides from membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF3 and ORF9b were occasionally detected in COVID-19 patients.",
                                "We also analyzed longitudinal samples from 23 COVID-19 patients. Most patients displayed an antibody response to peptides derived from the S or N in the second week after symptom onset, with many displaying an antibody response by the end of the first week (FIG. 2C). The relative strength and onset of the antibody response to the S and N differed dramatically between individuals, and the initial immune response showed no preference for the S or N. The signal intensity of antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 epitopes did not increase over time, further suggesting that ORF1 antibodies likely represent a preexisting cross-reactive response.",

An example IgG response from a single patient to the SARS-CoV-2 S and N is shown in FIG. 3A. We observed strong concordance between the viral regions enriched by the 56-mer and 20-mer fragments, demonstrating the robustness of VirScan. In many cases we observed recognition of overlapping 56-mer peptides, indicating an epitope in the common region.",

We identified four regions each in the S and N that are recurrently targeted by antibodies from >15% of COVID-19 patients, with additional regions recognized less frequently. Overall, IgG and IgA recognize the same protein regions with similar frequencies across the population. However, when IgG and IgA responses were compared within individuals, we observed considerable divergence (FIG. 3C): many epitopes were recognized by only IgG, only IgA, or both IgG and IgA within an individual patient. Together, these data suggest that patients raise distinct IgG and IgA antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, but the regions targeted are largely shared at a population level.",

Interrogating the model using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a method to compute the contribution of each feature of the data to the predictive model (20), we identified peptides from SARS-CoV-2 S and N plus homologous peptides from SARS-CoV and BatCoV-HKU-3 and BatCoV-279 that were highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (FIGS. 4C-D).",
                                "We leveraged these insights to develop a simple, rapid Luminex-based diagnostic for COVID-19. We chose 12 SARS-CoV-2 peptides predicted by VirScan data and the machine-learning model to be highly indicative of SARS-CoV-2 exposure history (Table 1). These SARS-CoV-2 peptides, plus two positive control peptides from Rhinovirus A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that are recognized in over 80% of seropositive individuals by VirScan (9), and a negative control peptide from HIV-1, were coupled to Luminex beads (39). We tested 163 COVID-19 patient samples and 165 pre-COVID-19 era controls for IgG reactivity to the Luminex panel. We detected clear responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in COVID-19 patient samples but rarely in the pre-COVID-19 era controls (FIG. 4E). Using the Luminex data, we developed a logistic regression model that predicted COVID-19 infection history with 89.6% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity (AUC=0.97) (FIGS. 4F-G). A subset of the COVID-19 positive samples (n=107) were also examined using an in-house ELISA using three SARS-CoV-2 antigens: N, S, and the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Considering a sample positive if it scored above the 99% specificity threshold on any one of the three ELISA antigens, we determined that the sensitivity of the Luminex assay for this subset (88.8%) was similar to that of the ELISA (90.7%) (FIGS. 13A-D). Among samples run on all three assays, VirScan significantly out-performed both the Luminex and ELISAs (FIG. 13A and C). Remarkably, our optimal model integrated only 3 SARS-CoV-2 peptides which were also the most discriminatory 20-mers in the VirScan data: N 386-406, S 810-830, and S 1146-1166. IgG responses in the COVID-19 patients were highly correlated between the Luminex and VirScan assays, providing orthogonal validation of the VirScan data and supporting the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-induced humoral responses to these regions of the S and N (FIG. 13D).",

                                "We next considered whether differences in the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 or to other viruses might be associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease. We grouped the COVID-19 patients into two subsets: those who required hospitalization (n=101), and those who did not (n=131). We compared the responses to peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins between the hospitalized (H) and non-hospitalized (NH) groups, and found that the H group exhibited stronger and broader antibody responses to S and N peptides that might be due to epitope spreading (FIG. 5A). We then analyzed 32 NH COVID-19 samples, 32 H COVID-19 samples, and 32 pre-COVID-19 era negative controls with the Luminex assay, and similarly observed that the H group had stronger and broader antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides compared with the NH group (FIG. 5B).",
                                "VirScan also offers the opportunity to examine the history of previous viral infections and to determine correlates of COVID-19 outcomes. For example, prior viral exposure could provide some protection if cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies or T cell responses are stimulated upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (21, 22). Alternatively, cross-reactive antibodies to viral surface proteins could increase the risk of severe disease due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as has been observed for SARS-CoV (23, 24). Furthermore, exposure to certain viruses could impact the response to SARS-CoV-2 by altering the immune system. To examine these possibilities, we analyzed the virome-wide VirScan data and found that overall, the NH patients exhibited greater responses to individual peptides from common viruses such as Rhinoviruses, Influenza viruses, and Enteroviruses, while the H patients displayed greater responses to peptides from cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) (FIG. 5C). These observations may be influenced by demographic differences in the NH and H cohorts as described below.",
                                "We sought to understand whether the differential reactivity to CMV and HSV-1 between the H and NH patients was due to differences in the strength of antibody responses or the prevalence of infection (these viruses are common, but not ubiquitous as are Rhinoviruses, Enteroviruses and Influenza viruses). Using VirScan data, we found that the H group had a higher incidence of both CMV and HSV-1 infection: 82.2% (83/101) of the H group were positive for CMV versus 37.4% (49/131) of the NH group, while 92.1% (93/101) of the H group were positive for HSV-1 versus 45.8% (60/131) of the NH group. To examine the relative strength of the antibody responses, we considered only CIV or HSV-1 seropositive individuals from the NH and H groups: the antibody response to both CMV (FIG. 5D) and HSV-1 (FIG. 14) was stronger among the NH individuals. Thus, the differing seroprevalence of CIV and HSV-1 in the NH versus H groups likely explain the results shown in FIG. 5C. We conclude that antibody responses to nearly all viruses, except SARS-CoV-2, were weaker in the H patients compared to the NH patients.",
                                "These striking differences led us to examine potential demographic covariates between the NH and H groups. We found that age, sex, and race were all significantly associated with COVID-19 severity, as has been reported (25, 26). Higher age, male sex, and non-white ethnicity groups were significantly overrepresented in the H group compared with the NH group. Furthermore, hospitalized males exhibited stronger responses to N than hospitalized females while non-hospitalized males and females did not exhibit differential responses to any SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Advanced age is a dominant risk factor for severe COVID-19 and is correlated with reduced immune function (38). In light of the age difference between the H (median age 58) and NH (median age 42) patients in our cohort, we reasoned that the antigens recognized more strongly in the NH group might reflect more general age-associated changes in humoral immunity. To test this hypothesis, we examined VirScan data for a cohort of 648 healthy, pre-pandemic donors. We characterized the recognition of each NH-associated peptide in subsets of the healthy donors representing different age groups and observed a general decline in recognition with age, including a median 19% reduction in recognition from age 42 to 58 (FIG. 5E). These data suggest that age-related changes to the immune system may in part explain the observation of weaker antibody responses to most viruses in the H group. While correlative and potentially influenced by other demographic differences between the NH and H cohorts, the broad age-related diminution in immune system activity we observed could be an important aspect of the increased severity in the H group.",
                                "**Example 7. Cross Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 Epitopes**",
                                "We returned to the question of epitope cross-reactivity, this time examining antibody responses to the triple-alanine scanning library. For each 56-mer peptide spanning the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, this library contained a collection of scanning mutants: the first mutant peptide encoded 3 alanines instead of the first 3 residues, the second mutant peptide contained the 3 alanines moved one residue downstream, and so on (FIGS. 14A-B). Antibodies that recognize the wild-type 56-mer peptide will not recognize mutant versions of the peptide containing alanine substitutions at critical residues; thus, the location of the linear epitope can be deduced by looking for \u201cantibody footprints\u201d, indicated by stretches of alanine mutants missing from the pool of immunoprecipitated phage. The first and last triple-alanine mutations to interfere with binding are expected to start two amino acids before the first residue essential for the antibody binding, and end two amino acids after the last.",
                                "With respect to cross-reactivity, IgG from COVID-19 patients recognized more 56-mer peptides from the common HCoVs HKU1, OC43, 299E, and NL63, than IgG from pre-COVID-19 era controls. This difference is primarily driven by a dramatic increase in recognition of S peptides from the HCoVs and is likely a result of cross-reactivity of antibodies developed during SARS-CoV-2 infection (FIG. 6A).",
                                "We mapped the position of all HCoV S peptides that display increased recognition in COVID-19 patient samples onto the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. This revealed four immunodominant regions recognized by >25% of COVID-19 patients (FIG. 6B). Comparing the frequency of peptide recognition between the COVID-19 patients and pre-COVID-19 era controls showed that two of these immunogenic regions in SARS-CoV-2 S are likely strongly cross-reactive with homologous regions of other HCoVs, as the frequency of recognition of the HCoV peptides at these regions rises in COVID-19 patients. For instance, peptides from all four seasonal HCoVs that span the region corresponding to residues 811-830 of SARS-CoV-2 S are frequently recognized by COVID-19 patients but much less so by pre-COVID-19 era controls, suggesting that this recognition is a result of antibodies developed or boosted in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using triple-alanine scanning mutagenesis (FIGS. 14A-B), we mapped the antibody footprints in this region to an 11 amino acid stretch that is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and all four common HCoVs, which explains the cross-reactivity (FIGS. 6C-D). Similarly, both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 peptides corresponding to S 1144-1163 were recognized much more frequently by COVID-19 patients than pre-COVID-19 era controls, and triple-alanine-scanning mutagenesis confirmed that the antibody footprints are located within a 10 amino acid stretch conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 but not the other HCoVs. In contrast, the epitope sequences around S 551-570 and S 766-785 are not conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the seasonal HCoVs, and indeed these epitopes are not cross-reactive. One HCoV-HKU1 peptide spanning S 551-570 scores in both COVID-19 patients and pre-COVID-19 era control samples; however, its frequency of detection is not further boosted in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the antibody responsible for boosting the SARS-CoV-2 S 551-570 peptide is distinct from the antibody recognizing the HCoV-HKU1 peptide, consistent with differences in sequence at this location (FIG. 6C).",
                                "Interestingly, we detected antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 S 811-830 in 79% of COVID-19 patients, but we also saw responses to the corresponding peptides from OC43 and 229E in \u02dc20% of the pre-COVID-19 era controls and these responses seem to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. It is possible that some patients have pre-existing antibodies to this region that cross-react and are expanded during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This might explain the remarkably high prevalence of antibody responses to this epitope, and suggests that anamnestic responses to seasonal coronaviruses may influence the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, this region is located directly after the predicted S2\u2032 cleavage site for SARS-CoV-2 and overlaps the fusion peptide. A recent study showed that adding an excess of the fusion peptide reduced neutralization, implying that an antibody that binds the fusion peptide might contribute to neutralization by interfering with membrane fusion (27, 29). Given the frequency of seroreactivity toward this epitope in COVID-19 patients, it will be important to determine if the antibodies recognizing this epitope are neutralizing in future studies.",

                                "We also used the triple-alanine scanning mutagenesis library to map antibody footprints across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome (FIG. 7, FIGS. 12A-D and Tables 3-4). We used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to analyze the mutagenesis data and detect antibody footprints. By integrating signals across stretches of consecutive residues, the HMM successfully distinguished antibody footprints from random noise and thus detected regions containing epitopes with improved sensitivity and with far greater resolution than was possible with the 56-mer peptide data alone (see Methods) (FIGS. 8A-C, FIGS. 9A-B). We performed hierarchical clustering on the antibody footprints identified by the HMM to determine the number of distinct epitopes (here defined as unique antibody footprints) that we detected across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (FIGS. 10A-F). Overall, we identified 3103 antibody footprints across 169 COVID-19 patient samples and mapped 823 distinct epitopes (Table 4). These epitopes are not evenly distributed along the proteins but rather fall into 303 epitope clusters, each of which contains multiple overlapping epitopes (FIGS. 10A-F, Table 3). For example, across the 89 IgA samples that recognized the epitope cluster from S 1135-1165, we identified 9 epitopes that overlap but have distinct triple-alanine scanning profiles that indicate unique antibody-epitope interactions (FIG. 10C). Individual epitopes are recognized at a wide range of frequencies in the COVID-19 patients. The average COVID-19 patient sample contained antibodies to \u02dc18 distinct linear epitopes (FIGS. 11A-I), although this is likely an underestimate of the total epitope count per person as VirScan does not efficiently detect antibodies recognizing discontinuous (conformational) epitopes (although such antibodies may retain some affinity to linear peptides comprising the epitope).",
                                "The SARS-CoV-2 epitope landscape includes regions recognized by a large fraction of COVID-19 patients (public epitopes) and regions recognized by one or a few individuals (private epitopes). For example, we mapped 6 distinct epitopes in the region spanning N 151-175 (FIG. 12C). One of these epitopes was recognized by nearly one-third of the COVID-19 patients, while the rest were detected by less than 2% of the COVID-19 patients. Similarly, the region spanning S 766-835 contained over 20 distinct epitopes, including the highly public epitope cluster near S815 and the public epitope cluster near S770 that is preferentially recognized by IgA (FIG. 7B). This epitope cluster was identified by 43% of COVID-19 patient IgA samples but only 4% of COVID-19 patient IgG samples. In another example, we detected at least 20 distinct epitopes within a stretch of just 46 residues in N 363-408, 10 of which were specific to IgA and 2 of which were specific to IgG (FIG. 12D).",
                                "We also mapped at least 12 distinct epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, including 5 in the receptor binding motif (RBM) that binds ACE2, the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and 5 that are directly adjacent to ACE2 binding sites (FIGS. 7C-D, FIG. 8A). For example, S 414-427 (labeled E2 in FIGS. 7A-H) spans residue K417 in the RBD; K417 makes a direct contact with the human ACE2 protein in structures of ACE2 bound to the RBD. Thus, antibodies recognizing E2 are likely to block ACE2 binding and have neutralizing activity (FIG. 7E). Epitope S 454-463 (labeled E6 in FIGS. 7A-H) also overlaps ACE2 contact residues and partially overlaps the binding site of the neutralizing antibody CB6, suggesting that antibodies recognizing this epitope also have neutralizing potential (28-30) (FIG. 7G). Several other epitopes also span or are adjacent to critical residues contacted by ACE2 (FIGS. 7F and H). Thus, our data reveal some of the likely binding sites for neutralizing antibodies.",
