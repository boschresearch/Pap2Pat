    "abstract": "Compositions that are plants, seeds or crops that have a combination of defective BADC genes and genes for making hydroxy fatty acids produced normal levels of oil containing specialty fatty acids, and exhibited an increases in total oil accumulation, increase in absolute hydroxy (specialized) fatty acid accumulation per seed and/or per plant and/or per unit land area. Defective BADC genes and genes for synthesizing hydroxy fatty acids are combined to produce specialized fatty acids without substantially slowing production of endogenous fatty acids. Methods are also described for increasing production of unusual fatty acids and increasing total fatty acid levels in plants by a mechanism involving combining defective BADC genes and genes for making hydroxy fatty acids to produce steady or increased levels of oil containing the increased specialty products as described herein.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "When enzymes that convert common fatty acids to unusual fatty acids (hydroxy, epoxy, conjugated or cyclopropane fatty acids) are expressed in plants like Arabidopsis or Camelina, the unusual fatty acid accumulates but the total yield of fatty acids decreases. Mutations in the badc1,badc3 genes i.e., negative regulators of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) may mitigate this effect and restore or maintain total fatty acid levels thereby facilitating the accumulation of unusual fatty acids.",
                        "The present discovery may be a way to reverse a roadblock in plants to specialty oil production thereby providing a pathway to grow crops that produce industrially important high-value fatty acids. Hundreds of naturally occurring specialty fatty acids (building blocks of oils) may have potential for use as raw materials for making for example, lubricants, plastics, or pharmaceuticals, if they can be produced at large scale by crop plants. Prior attempts to put genes for making these specialty building blocks into crops have resulted in the adverse effect, namely, transgenic seeds making the specialty fatty acids experienced a reduction in their oil accumulation.",
                        "The mechanism behind the oil-production slowdown is described herein. Model plants were crossbred and detailed biochemical-genetic analyses were conducted that demonstrate a strategy for reversing the roadblock and increasing production. This may provide potential for making at least one or more industrially important specialty fatty acid in plants, crops or seeds.",
                        "While the genes responsible for making specialty fatty acids were discovered several decades ago, this present mechanism may allow them to be put into compositions such as plants, crops or seeds to make renewable sources of desired fatty acids without slowing fatty acid and oil synthesis. The study focused on challenges associated with specialized fatty acid production in plants, and on deciphering the biochemical feedback loop that plants use to regulate ordinary or regular fatty acid (FA) and oil production. This study led to the discovery of a mechanism by which plants down-regulate oil synthesis when levels of a plant's ordinary or regular (endogenous) fatty acids (FAs) get too high. In other words, the system operates or functions like a thermostat. When endogenous FA (heat) gets above a certain set point, the system (furnace) turns off.",
                        "With plant oils, the machinery that controls production is an enzyme called ACCase (acetyl coA carboxylase). It has four parts, or subunits: biotin carboxylase (BC), biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and two carboxyltransferases, \u03b1-carboxyltransferase and \u03b2-carboxyltransferase. As long as endogenous fatty acids are below a certain level, the four subunits act coordinately to convert acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. But feeding plants additional endogenous fatty acids triggers a substitution in the machinery in which the BCCP subunit is gets replaced by biotin attachment domain-containing protein (BADC), a homolog of BADC that lacks a critical biotin attachment amino acid and is therefore inactive. ACCase in which BCCP has been replaced by BADC slows the production of malonyl-CoA and therefor the synthesis of fatty acids. In contrast, the shutdown mechanism triggered by the accumulation of specialty fatty acids (ones being produced by genes expressed in the plant) kicks in when even small amounts of the \u201cforeign\u201d fatty acids are present, and endogenous fatty acids aren't in excess. Because of this, they appeared to be two separate processes. But it was speculated whether the specialty fatty acids were triggering the same off switch triggered by high levels of ordinary fatty acids.",
                        "In a strain of Arabidopsis (a model plant) with two of its BADC genes deleted, the downregulation of ACCase is disabled and the plants make high levels of endogenous fatty acids. Further study looked at what would happen if the BADC genes were disabled in plants engineered to produce specialty fatty acids. A research strategy was designed to crossbreed the defective off-switch plants with an Arabidopsis strain engineered to produce hydroxy fatty acids-one of the specialty types scientists would like to produce for industrial applications. This latter strain could make the hydroxy fatty acids, but its rate of oil synthesis was only half that of normal (unmodified) plants and it accumulated significantly less oil in its seeds.",
                        "When crossing four separate genetic factors (two mutant BADC genes, a mutant in fatty acid elongase 1 (FAE1) and an overexpression of the Ricinus communis 12-hydroxylase gene (FAH), it takes several plant generations to produce and identify plants homozygous for the four desired genes (see FIGS. 16A and 16B FAH sequences; FIGS. 16O and 16P FAE1 sequences; FIGS. 16U and 16V mutant FAE1 sequences). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were run for analyses of greater many hundreds of plants to find those homozygous for all four alleles. Those plants were biochemically characterized, to compare their rates of ACCase activity with those of the two parental Arabidopsis lines used to make the new genetic combinations. Plants that had the combination of defective BADC genes and genes required for making hydroxy fatty acids produced normal (unaltered) levels of oil containing the specialty products. Compared with plants that had normal (wild-type) BADC genes, the new plants exhibited increases in the total amount of fatty acid per seed, the total seed oil content per plant, and the seed yield per plant. The BADC-defective plants were unresponsive to the presence of hydroxy fatty acids and the usual response of turning off the ACCase was gone. The results prove that BADC is the mechanism for reducing ACCase activity in both scenarios\u2014the accumulation of excess endogenous fatty acids and the presence of hydroxy fatty acid.",
                        "The BADC mechanism may be specific to the accumulation of hydroxy fatty acids, or may be common to other \u2018foreign\u2019 fatty acids that also reduce ACCase activity. BADC may be a general mechanism, and mutations that reduce their activity may allow for the accumulation of additional specialty fatty acids in oil-rich seeds of crop plants with minimal reduction of oil yield. This fundamental mechanistic understanding of biochemical regulation may be useful towards a viable, sustainable bioeconomy. This approach may also be used to make valuable renewable industrial starting materials at low cost in plants from carbon dioxide and sunlight, rather than relying on petrochemicals.",

As used herein, the term \u201cantisense RNA\u201d refers to an RNA transcript that is complementary to all or a part of a mRNA that is normally produced in a cell. The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific gene transcript, i.e., at the 5\u2032 non-coding sequence, 3\u2032 non-translated sequence, introns, or the coding sequence. As used herein, the term \u201cRNA transcript\u201d refers to the product resulting from RNA polymerase-catalyzed transcription of a DNA sequence. When the RNA transcript is a perfect complimentary copy of the DNA sequence, it is referred to as the primary transcript or it may be an RNA sequence derived from post-transcriptional processing of the primary transcript and is referred to as the mature RNA.",
                        "\u201cReducing gene expression\u201d and grammatical equivalents refers to a reduction in one or both of DNA transcription into mRNA, and mRNA translation into a protein molecule. In one embodiment, reducing gene transcription refers to the absence (or observable decrease) in the level of protein and/or mRNA product from the target gene. Specificity refers to the ability to inhibit the target gene without manifest effects on other genes of the cell and without any effects on any gene within the cell that is producing the dsRNA molecule. The inhibition of gene expression of a target gene as described herein may result in novel phenotypic traits in the plant. Reduced gene expression may be achieved by completely silencing or down-regulating expression of a gene and/or partial or incomplete silencing or down-regulation of a gene and/or introducing a mutation into the gene. Post-transcriptional gene suppression by anti-sense or sense-oriented RNA to regulate gene expression in plant cells is known in the art, as is the use of dsRNA to suppress genes in plants. Post-transcriptional gene suppression in plants may employ both sense-oriented and anti-sense-oriented, transcribed RNA that is stabilized, e.g., as a hairpin or stem-and-loop structure. In one embodiment, BADC genes are partially or totally silenced by expression of an RNAi cassette as described in WO 2017/039834 and WO 2018/009626.",

In one embodiment, said mutation comprises deleting at least a portion of the coding region, deleting the entire gene, deleting at least a portion of sequences that regulates transcription of the gene, introducing an insertion and/or a frameshift mutation, etc. so that at least one mutated allele contains a deletion of the translation start site, transcription start codon, at least a portion of the promoter region, at least a portion of the coding region, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, said deleted sequences may be replaced with polynucleotides that are exogenous to the deleted gene sequences and that are flanked by sequences that are complementary to polynucleotide regions of the endogenous gene that flank the deleted gene sequences. In a further embodiment, at least one mutated allele is generated by site specific recombination, frame shift mutation, homologous recombination, CRISPR gene editing, or any combination thereof, in a cell such as an embryonic stem cell or germ cell.",

In some embodiments, genome editing methods are exemplified by the CRISPR-endonuclease system, which produces a site-specific modification of a target DNA as described in Doudna et al., U.S. Pat. No. 10,000,772 (incorporated by reference). \u201cCRISPR\u201d (\u201cclusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u201d) gene editing is exemplified in Examples 9 and 10, and is used to knockout plant genes in melon (Hooghvorst et al.

In this respect, the heterologous sequence may be native to the host genome, but be rearranged with respect to other genetic sequences within the host sequence. For example, a regulatory sequence may be heterologous in that it is linked to a different coding sequence relative to the native regulatory sequence. In addition, a particular sequence can be \u201cheterologous\u201d with respect to a cell or organism into which it is introduced (for example, a sequence that does not naturally occur in that particular cell or organism).",

                        "Hundreds of naturally occurring specialized fatty acids (FA) may have potential as chemical feedstocks if they can be produced at large scale by crop plants. However, transgenic expression of their biosynthetic genes has generally been accompanied by undesirable reductions in oil yield. For example, expression of Ricinus fatty acid hydroxylase (FAH) in the Arabidopsis fatty acid elongation mutant fae1 resulted in a 50% reduction of FA synthesis rate that was attributed to inhibition of acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACCase) by an undefined mechanism. The hypothesis that the ricinoleic acid-dependent decrease in ACCase activity is mediated by biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins was tested.",
                        "BADCs are inactive homologs of biotin carboxy carrier protein that lack a biotin cofactor and can inhibit ACCase. Arabidopsis contains three BADC genes. To reduce expression levels of BADC1 and BADC3 in fae1/FAH, homozygous badc1,3/fae1/FAH was created. The rate of FA synthesis in badc1, 3/fae1/FAH seeds doubled relative to fae1/FAH, restoring it to fae1 levels, increasing both native FA and HFA accumulation. Total FA per seed, seed oil content and seed yield per plant all increased in badc1,3/fae1/FAH, to 5.8 \u03bcg, 37% and 162 mg, respectively, relative to 4.9 \u03bcg, 33% and 126 mg, respectively, for fae1/FAH. Transcript levels of fatty acid synthesis-related genes including ACCase subunits did not significantly differ between badc1,3/fae1/FAH and fae1/FAH. These results demonstrate that BADC1 and BADC3 mediate ricinoleic acid-dependent inhibition of FA synthesis. It is proposed that BADC-mediated FAS (fatty acid synthesis) inhibition may be a general mechanism that limits FA accumulation in specialized FA-accumulating seeds.",

If successful, this would allow the production of chiral fatty acid feedstocks in an inexpensive and scalable manner. However, a barrier to progress in this area was the discovery that upon the accumulation of specialized fatty acids seed oil yields are significantly decreased (Cahoon et al., 2007; Haslam et al., 2013; Vanhercke et al., 2013; Bates et al., 2014). An example of this comes from attempts to increase the accumulation of hydroxy fatty acid (HFA) in seed oils, of which much of the work has been performed in the model system Arabidopsis (Lu et al., 2006).",
                        "HFAs contain one or more hydroxy group(s) on a fatty acid backbone, which confer beneficial properties such as higher viscosity and chemical reactivity. The hydroxyl group of HFAs make them useful chemical feedstocks for the production of a wide range of industrial products including but not limited to: resins, waxes, nylons, plastics, lubricants, cosmetics, and additives for coatings and paints (Kim et al., 2000). Moreover, HFAs could be used as intermediates in the production of biodegradable plastics, cyclic lactones and pharmaceuticals (Wang et al., 2012). Industrial use of HFAs are available from natural sources such as castor beans which may limit their availability. Isolation of the oleate hydroxylase FAH from castor bean over two decades ago raised the possibility of ricinoleic acid production in high-yielding oilcrops (van de Loo et al., 1995). However, in contrast to castor beans that accumulate approximately 90% of its FA as ricinoleic acid, transgenic Arabidopsis fatty acid elongation1 (fae1) mutant expressing the FAH i.e., fae1/FAH, (a line designated CL37) accumulated only 17% HFA in its total seed oil (Lu et al., 2006). The seeds of fae1/FAH also displayed many physiological deficits including reduced oil content and seed weight, low seed yield per plant compared with its parental fae1 line, and seed germination was also delayed (Adhikari et al., 2016).",
                        "Investigation of the reduced oil content of fae1/FAH revealed its FA synthesis rate was reduced compared to the parental fae1 line (Bates et al., 2014). While the molecular basis for this reduction in FA synthesis has not been reported, several attempts at overcoming it have proved at least partially successful. For example, overexpressing a master transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis WRINKLED1 (Adhikari et al., 2016) or a lipid droplet associated factor SEIPIN1 to increase lipid droplet size (Lunn et al., 2018). Development defects of HFA-accumulating seeds are partially mitigated upon the expression of several castor acyltransferases (Lunn et al., 2018). Stacking the expression of several castor acyltransferases, including GPAT9, LPAT2, and PDAT1A along with the castor hydroxylase fae1/FAH seeds produced abundant tri-HFA TAG, restored seed oil content and partially restored seedling establishment (Lunn et al., 2019). The expression of phosphatidylcholine:diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PDCT), encoded by the REDUCED OLEATE DESATURATION1 (ROD1) gene (Lu et al., 2009) which channels about 40% of the flux of polyunsaturated fatty from PC into DAG for TAG synthesis was found to potentiate efficient accumulation of HFA in Arabidopsis (Hu et al., 2012).",
                        "In dicotyledonous plants, heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) catalyzes the first committed step of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. This enzyme complex consists of four catalytic subunits: biotin carboxylase (BC), carboxyltransferase (CT)-\u03b1, CT-\u03b2, and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) (Salie et al., 2016). The two BCCP isoforms (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of Arabidopsis ACCase can interact with Biotin/lipoyl attachment domain containing (BADC) proteins (Feria Bourrellier et al., 2010). BADCs are BCCP homologs that contain a biotin attachment motif, but critically lack a biotinylation site. BADC proteins can act as negative regulators of ACCase due to their lack of the biotin adduct required for carboxylation (Salie et al., 2016) and a role for them in ACCase assembly was recently proposed. These proteins have been reported to significantly inhibit ACCase activity in both E. coli and Arabidopsis (Salie et al., 2016), and it was recently proposed that they can sense pH changes (Ye et al., 2020). An additional role for BADCs in ACCase assembly has also been proposed (Shivaiah et al., 2020).",
                        "Three BADC genes have been identified in Arabidopsis, single badc1, badc2, badc3 Arabidopsis knock-out mutants do not exhibit significant changes in oil content relative to wild type plants (Keereetaweep et al., 2018), while the badc1badc3 (badc1,3) double mutant showed increased fatty acid synthesis rate and a remarkable 25% increase in seed oil content (Keereetaweep et al., 2018).",
                        "In this context, badc1,3/fae1/FAH homozygous plant were generated by crossing badc1,3 double mutant with CL37, an Arabidopsis fae1 line expressing FAH (Lu et al., 2006). Downregulation of BADC1 and BADC3 in fae1/FAH doubled the rate of FA synthesis in developing seeds, restoring it to fae1 levels, and increased both native FA and HFA accumulation."

                                "It was previously reported that the accumulation of HFA in Arabidopsis seeds resulted in feedback inhibition of FA synthesis (Bates et al., 2014), with ACCase activity reduced by approximately 50% relative to the parental fae1 line. ACCase is often considered a rate limiting enzyme for FA synthesis and is therefore under tight genetic and biochemical regulation by a variety of mechanisms (Salie et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2020). In this study, we investigated the effects of null mutations in two negative regulatory subunits of ACCase i.e., badc1 and badc3 in FAH-expressing Arabidopsis seeds with respect to FA synthesis, common FA and HFA accumulation. The data demonstrates that eliminating BADC1 and BADC3 alleviates the HFA-dependent feedback inhibition of ACCase that results in a doubling FAS rate in badc1,3/fae1/FAH seeds restoring them to that of the parental fae1 line. Seed FA content of badc1,3/fae1/FAH was also restored to that of the parental fae1 line. That no significant increases were observed for transcripts corresponding to key FA synthesis-related genes in badc1,3/fae1/FAH is consistent with the increases being attributed to relief of BADC1 and BADC3-dependent inhibition of ACCase. Thus, data presented here employing badc1,3 null mutants demonstrates both the mechanism of HFA-dependent inhibition of ACCase and an approach to largely mitigating its effects by reducing or eliminating BADC isoforms 1 and 3. That the increased seed oil content in badc1,3/fae1/FAH didn't fully rescue seed weight relative to the parental fae1 line is consistent with previous reports in which the badc1,3 double mutant exhibited a small decrease in seed weight compare to that of wild type seeds, that likely resulted from a buildup of non-esterified FA under conditions in which their supply exceeds cellular demand. Support for this view comes from studies showing excess FAs can be associated with negative cellular consequences, including reductions in axillary bud growth in tobacco (Tso, 1964), microalgal growth (Bosma et al., 2008), cell elongation in Arabidopsis (Li et al., 2011) and cell death in Arabidopsis (Fan et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015).",
                                "The work presented here is an extension of previous studies that focused on understanding mechanisms underlying lipid homeostasis under conditions in which FA supply exceeds that of cellular demand. Using a Brassica napus suspension cell culture we fed FA in the form of Tween esters and monitored reductions in the rate of FAS. Exposure of oleoyl-Tween for up to 2 days resulted in oleoyl-ACP-dependent reversible inhibition of ACCase (Andre et al., 2012); whereas prolonged exposure resulted in irreversible BADC-dependent inhibition (Keereetaweep et al., 2018). That BADC-dependent inhibition of ACCase activity can be elicited by chronic exposure to excesses oleate, a common naturally occurring monounsaturated FA, and ricinoleic acid, a non-native fatty acid, is intriguing. Evidence is accumulating that BADCs are conditional inhibitors of ACCase activity, i.e., that upon the accumulation of excess FA, biotin-lacking, and therefore inactive BADC subunits, replace active BCCP subunits in the BC/BCCP ACCase subcomplex (Salie et al., 2016) (Keereetaweep et al., 2018)(Liu et al., 2019). Based on in vitro studies in which a one-unit pH change caused small changes in the dissociation constants of BADCs and BCCP for BC, it has been proposed that this might contribute to in vivo changes in the inhibition of ACCase related to light- and dark-dependent pH changes (Ye et al., 2020). However, in vivo evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking, and the experiments were conducted under non-physiological conditions. Thus, whether excess FA causes BCCP to dissociate from BC, allowing BADC to join the complex, or whether excess FA drives BADCs into the complex displacing BCCP subunits is an open question that requires additional investigation to resolve.",
                                "Due to the desirability of creating an HFA-accumulating variant of a high-yielding crop, work to date has mostly focused on increasing the accumulation of HFA without deleterious effects on seed oil content. Previous studies have shown that negative HFA-dependent deficits including decreased seed oil and seed weight could be mitigated by the overexpression of several common fatty acid accumulation factors. For example, overexpression of OLEOSIN1, a lipid droplet protection protein involved in TAG biosynthesis with FAH was shown to enhance HFA accumulation (Lu et al., 2006). Likewise, overexpression of SEIPIN, a lipid droplet development factor that was previously reported to increase total seed oil (Cai et al., 2015), when expressed in HFA-accumulating seed, increased both total oil and HFA content by more than 60%, likely by increasing LD size and creating a larger sink for TAG-accumulation (Lunn et al., 2018). Seed-specific expression of the WRINKLED1 transcription factor in fae1/FAH restored FA content (Adhikari et al., 2016). Other efforts have focused on the use of factors isolated from species that naturally accumulate modified fatty acid (mFA), in which FA-metabolizing enzymes have evolved preference for mFA. These studies were initially focused on enhancing the transfer of mFA from PC into TAG (Burgal et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011; van Erp et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). In another interesting example, the 18C ricinoleic acid is elongated to the corresponding 20 C lesquerolic acid by a specialized Physaria elongase (Snapp et al., 2014). That lesquerolic acid alleviates feedback inhibition of FAS likely reflects decreased discrimination against lesquerolic relative to ricinoleic in its transfer from PC to TAG. Co-expression of multiple mFA-preferring enzymes, e.g., three castor acyltransferases: GPAT9, LPAT2, and PDAT1A in fae1/FAH seeds resulted in the production of abundant tri-HFA TAG and restored seed oil content relative to the parental fae1 line (Lunn et al., 2019).",
                                "The reduced levels of seed oil accumulation reported for HFA-accumulating seed is a general phenomenon common to other mFAs including epoxy (Li et al., 2012), conjugated (Cahoon et al., 2006) and cyclopropane (Yu et al., 2014) FA. The findings presented here demonstrating that knocking out BADC1 and BADC3 in FAH-producing Arabidopsis seeds restored the FA synthesis rate, total FA, seed yield may not be specific for HFA. Indeed, data herein suggests that reducing or eliminating BADC1 and BADC3 gene expression in other mFA-accumulating plants may have similar beneficial effects on mFA accumulation. Further, combining our BADC reduction strategy with the coexpression of other genes, or combinations of genes and/or factors described above will likely increase mFA accumulation to levels equivalent to, or exceeding those of, their natural hosts.",
                                "Germination rates typically decline with increasing accumulation levels of mFA (modified fatty acid) accumulation in non-native hosts, even in plants that accumulate normal levels of TAG such as described herein and in previous studies (Lunn et al., 2019). This suggests that mFA generally impair the mobilization of lipid reserves needed for energy production during the critical stages of germination (Lunn et al., 2019). Thus, cellular components that participate in the mobilization mFA-containing TAG, mFA transport and \u03b2-oxidation represent additional targets for characterization and expression in non-native hosts to improve cellular energy supplies needed for germination to create robust mFA crops of the future.",
                                "We tested the hypothesis that HFA-dependent reduction in FA synthesis can be mediated by BADCs by the introgression of badc1,3 into fae1/FAH. Consistent with the hypothesis, knocking out BADC1 and BADC3 expression increased FA synthesis rates in developing seeds by two-fold, restoring the FA synthesis rate to that of the parental fae1 line. This equally increased both normal FA and HFA accumulation in seeds. The total FA per seed and total oil content in seeds and seeds yield per plant all increased, to an average of 5.8 \u03bcg, 37% and 162 mg respectively, compared to 4.9 \u03bcg, 33% and 126 mg of fae1/FAH respectively. That fatty acid synthesis-related genes including ACCase subunits, FA condensing enzymes and transcription factors were not significantly increased upon knockout of BADC1 and BADC3, is consistent with the role of BADCs as inhibitors of FA synthesis. Knocking out BADC1 and BADC3 alleviated the inhibition of ACCase, providing a corresponding increase in the FA synthesis rate and steady or improvement in seedling establishment. Combining the deceased expression of BADCs described herein along with the expression of other demonstrated mFA accumulating factors will likely realize the goal of creating crops with industrially relevant levels of HFA-accumulation. This strategy will likely be generalizable to increasing accumulation of many other mFA in seed oils.",
                                "The badc1,3/fae1/FAH Arabidopsis showed better establishment than fae1/FAH although their establishment rates are similar. Roots of ten-day old plants were longer and better developed as were aerial parts of the plants. The seed yield per plant was also rescued.",
                                "Data herein shows (Example 10) that disruption of badc3 alone in CL37 (fae1/FAH) Arabidopsis increased HFA percentage. Surprisingly, although one expects this disruption to decrease FAS and seed weight and impair seed germination, nonetheless it was empirically determined that the seed weight and seed yield per plant were both increased significantly, and seed germination rate was restored to wild type levels. BADC3 are edited/silenced in specialized fatty acid (sFA) producing crops such as Camelina, soybean and Brassica napus in the same manner as disclosed herein regarding editing/silencing badc1,3. Disruption/silencing of BADC3 in specialized FA-producing crops should lead to increased sFA, crop yield and recovered seed germination.",

The level of 18:1, FAH's substrate, is only 13% of TFA in wild type Columbia, therefore fae1, which contains much higher levels (33%) of 18:1 in its seed oil was used. Seeds resulting from this cross were germinated and genetically screened to identify heterozygous badc1,3/fae1/FAH plants. F2 seeds from the heterozygous badc1,3/fae1/FAH plants were planted to screen for homozygous plants which were used for the following studies.

WRI1 was previously shown to regulate a number of FA synthesis genes (Maeo et al., 2009) and all three BADC genes (Liu et al., 2019). Analysis of WRI1 from the same materials showed no significant changes in WRI1 transcript levels (FIG. 8). That the levels of transcripts corresponding to these genes were not significantly different from controls, suggests that the alleviation of inhibition of FA synthesis is not the result of increased transcription of other FA synthesis genes.",

                                "FA content in seeds was quantified to determine if badc1,3 alleviated the feedback inhibition of FA synthesis in seeds with HFA production. fae1 seeds contain 6.00\u00b10.07 \u03bcg of total FA, and overexpression of FAH in fae1 significantly reduced FA to 4.94\u00b10.10 g per seed. After introduction of badc1,3, the FA content of the seeds significantly increase by 16.8% to 5.77\u00b10.04 \u03bcg per seed (FIG. 3A). Correspondingly, seeds of fae1 plants yielded 34.3\u00b10.4% oil content, expression of FAH significantly decreased the oil content to 32.7\u00b10.7% and the introduction of badc1,3 increased the oil content to 36.9\u00b10.3% (FIG. 3B). The lower oil content in fae1/FAH has been reported to reduce seed weight (Adhikari et al., 2016). Indeed, expression of FAH in fae1 seeds decreased average seed weight from 17.5\u00b11.1 \u03bcg to 15.1\u00b10.7 \u03bcg (FIG. 3C), but introduction of badc1,3 did not significantly increase seed weight (15.6\u00b11.0 \u03bcg per seed). The small significant differences in FA content and seed yield reported herein can be attributed to differences in BADC and FAE gene expression because that both of the T-DNA lines (Bolle et al., 2013) and the fae1 (Kunst L, 1992) line were created in the Arabidopsis Columbia-0 (Arabidopsis Genome, 2000) background.",

                                "It was previously reported that the production of HFA in fae1 seeds expressing FAH was associated with a reduced rate of de novo FA synthesis that resulted in the observed decrease in oil content compared with the fae1 parental line (Bates et al., 2014). The introduction of badc1,3 in the fae1/FAH line restored the FA content suggesting that it had alleviated the previously observed inhibition of FA synthesis reported in non-HFA producing lines (Salie et al., 2016; Keereetaweep et al., 2018). To test this hypothesis, mid-phase developing seeds 11-13 days after flowering were collected and their fatty acid synthesis rates were determined by measuring the rate of [14C]acetate incorporation into FAs by total lipid extraction and scintillation counting. We first validated the assay by showing linear incorporation of [14C]acetate between 20 and 100 minutes using badc1,3 seeds (FIG. 9) and chose a 60 minute incubations for subsequent experiments. As shown in FIG. 5, compared to fae1, the badc1,3 double mutant showed a 36.8% increase in fatty acid synthesis rate, whereas expression of FAH in fae1 decreased fatty acid synthesis rate by 52.2% with respect to that of fae1. When FAH was expressed in badc1,3/fae1, the fatty acid synthesis rate was fully restored to that of parental fae1 seeds.",

To test if the restored FA content in badc1,3 can mitigate the germination defects, seeds of badc1,3/fae1/FAH were tested for germination and seedling establishment relative to the fae1/FAH, badc1,3 parental lines and fae1. Emergence of the radicle was used as a germination marker, and the appearance of roots and green cotyledons was used as a marker for establishment. Germination of fae1/FAH lines was reduced to 88% compared with 99% for fae1 (FIG. 6A). The germination rate of badc1,3/fae1/FAH was even lower than fae1/FAH at 76%. badc1,3 showed a germination rate of 95%, i.e., similar to that of fae1. The seedling establishment rates of fae1 and badc1,3 were the same as their germination rates (FIG. 6B). 90% of geminated fae1/FAH seedlings continued to establishment, whereas 99% of germinated badc1,3/fae1/FAH seeds continued to establishment, resulting in similar establishment rates with respect to all seeds for these two genotypes. Comparison of seedling establishment rates at 7 and 10 days showed the combining badc1,3 with fae1/FAH had the effect of reducing germination while increasing seedling establishment (FIG. 10). While the growth rate of badc1,3/fae1/FAH was higher than that of fae1/FAH, at maturity no visible differences were observed with respect to plant height and leaf size. However, fae1 plants produced 158 mg of seeds per plant, which decreased to 126 mg in fae1/FAH, while the introduction of badc1,3 in the fae1/FAH lines more than compensated, increasing seed yield per plant to 162 mg (FIG. 6C).

RcFAH gene is placed under the control of seed-specific phaseolin promoter (see vector diagram of FIG. 15) and transformed into fad2/fae1 Camelina. Independently transformed lines are analyzed by gas chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine their lipid composition. Homozygous lines with high HFA accumulation are chosen for disruption of BADC 1 and BADC3 gene expression with the use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Camelina is a hexaploid so the following target sites are identified to simultaneously disrupt all 3 isoforms of each gene: i.e, either CGGTGGAGATTATCCAACAG (SEQ ID NO: 44) or TTATGGTGATCCTCTGGTTG (SEQ ID NO: 45) are used as the target site for editing Camelina BADC1, including Csa04g042500.1, Csa06g030800.I and Csa09g068300.I; and AAAATTAAAATCTCAGCAGT (SEQ ID NO: 46) is the target site for editing Camelina BADC3 including Csa15g020290.1, Csa19g022480.1 and Csa01g018320.1. The transgenic seeds are screened in media supplemented with Hygromycin B and DNA is extracted and BADC 1 and BADC3 genes are amplified and sequenced to identify the CRISPR/cas9-induced lesion and verify the target gene disruption. The fatty acid synthesis rate in developing seed of fad2/fae1 !FAHIbadc1,3 is evaluated. Mature seeds are collected, seed size and seed weight are measured, and fatty acid methyl esters are prepared from the seeds for GC-MS analysis for FA composition and total FA quantification.",

Finally, we constructed two vectors, one targeting the 2nd and 5th exons of BADC1, the other targeting the 2nd and 4th exons of BADC3 and transformed each into CL37.
