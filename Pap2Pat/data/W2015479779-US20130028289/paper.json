    "abstract": "A brief review of recent progress in researches, productions and applications of full distributed fiber Raman photon sensors at China Jiliang University (CJLU) is presented. In order to improve the measurement distance, the accuracy, the space resolution, the ability of multi-parameter measurements, and the intelligence of full distributed fiber sensor systems, a new generation fiber sensor technology based on the optical fiber nonlinear scattering fusion principle is proposed. A series of new generation full distributed fiber sensors are investigated and designed, which consist of new generation ultra-long distance full distributed fiber Raman and Rayleigh scattering photon sensors integrated with a fiber Raman amplifier, auto-correction full distributed fiber Raman photon temperature sensors based on Raman correlation dual sources, full distributed fiber Raman photon temperature sensors based on a pulse coding source, full distributed fiber Raman photon temperature sensors using a fiber Raman wavelength shifter, a new type of Brillouin optical time domain analyzers (BOTDAs) integrated with a fiber Raman amplifier for replacing a fiber Brillouin amplifier, full distributed fiber Raman and Brillouin photon sensors integrated with a fiber Raman amplifier, and full distributed fiber Brillouin photon sensors integrated with a fiber Brillouin frequency shifter. The Internet of things is believed as one of candidates of the next technological revolution, which has driven hundreds of millions of class markets. Sensor networks are important components of the Internet of things. The full distributed optical fiber sensor network (Rayleigh, Raman, and Brillouin scattering) is a 3S (smart materials, smart structure, and smart skill) system, which is easy to construct smart fiber sensor networks. The distributed optical fiber sensor can be embedded in the power grids, railways, bridges, tunnels, roads, constructions, water supply systems, dams, oil and gas pipelines and other facilities, and can be integrated with wireless networks.",

                "The distributed optical fiber temperature sensor uses optical fiber Raman scattering to measure temperatures, which is an intrinsic type of the optical fiber sensor. In a distributed temperature sensor (DTS) system, the optical fiber is not only a transmission medium but also a sensing material. The thermal field along the fiber modulates the intensity of backward Raman scattering (anti-Stokes Raman scattering), and then the backward Raman scattering signal is detected by a photoelectric detector via a wavelength division multiplexer (WDM). After the signal averaging and demodulation, the real-time temperature distribution information will be extracted and presented from noises. Distributed optical fiber temperature sensors can be considered as a kind of the fiber optic temperature measurement network [1]. In the time domain, the time difference of the backscattered light of an injection pulse is proportional to the fiber length that the pulse has traveled, which is often called optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR) principle. So the distributed optical fiber temperature sensor system is also considered as an optical fiber temperature measurement radar system. Distributed optical fiber Raman and Brillouin scattering sensor networks are 3S (smart materials, smart structure, and smart skill) systems. They can be embedded and equipped to power grids, railways, bridges, tunnels, roads, constructions, water supply systems, dams, oil and gas pipelines. They can be easily combined with the Internet and wireless networks to constitute Internet of things for identification, display and control.",
                "The research team at China Jiliang University is one of the earliest teams in studying distributed fiber Raman photon sensors. In the past 20 years, we have completed many national, provincial and ministerial research projects, and achieved a number of scientific and technological achievements. Tens of independent intellectual property rights have been industrialized. Some of the achievements and projects are displayed in the following: we cooperated with Shenyang Fire Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security to obtain a support from National \"95\" Key Scientific and Technological Project, which is named as a new technology of the underground floor for the fire detection and alarm in the large space [2,3]; a 6-km distributed optical fiber sensor system using semiconductor lasers (No.D98-A01, 1996) from the Innovation Project of State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision. We cooperated with the National Coal Mine Safety Engineering Center to apply a 10-km full distributed fiber Raman photon sensor into the continuous temperature measurement of the mine belt conveyor [4,5], which was awarded the second prize of the Science and Technology Achievements in Zhejiang Province in 2001. We also cooperated with South Korea Electrical Science Research Institute to complete a technology cooperation projects between China and South Korea Ministry of Science and Technology. This project includes the application of a distributed optical fiber temperature measurement system in power industries. We completed a project from the Key Scientific and Technological Project of Zhejiang Province, which was on the application and research of a 30-km distributed optical fiber temperature measurement network (No. 011101081,2000). This work was awarded the second prize of Scientific Research of Higher Schools of Zhejiang Province in 2003 [6,7].

                "There are two kinds of scattering in the interaction between the light and fiber molecules, which are the elastic scattering and the non-elastic scattering. The elastic scattering refers to those whose frequencies of the scattering (or photon energy) remain constant, while the non-elastic scattering refers to those whose frequencies of the scattering (or photon energy) change (increase or decrease). Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering are generated when light waves interact with the media with energy exchanging. When an incident photon is scattered, a low-frequency Stokes or high-frequency anti-Stokes photon is generated, which is resulted from the transitions between vibration levels of the corresponding molecules. Raman scattering includes the Stokes Raman photons which emit optical phonons and the anti-Stokes Raman photons which absorb optical phonons. In optical fibers, the probe light interacts with thermal acoustic waves, which is produced by electrostriction caused by light waves. And the refractive index of the fiber has a periodic modulation (index grating). Thus, the Brillouin photons are generated, which is also called the Brillouin scattering. The Stokes Brillouin photons emit acoustic phonons, and the anti-Stokes Brillouin photons absorb acoustic phonons."

There co-exist many kinds of scattering in fibers, whose spectral characteristics are different, as shown in Table 1. The Raman scattering is an inelastic collision in the interactions between the incident photon and fiber molecules. Because the frequency of optical phonons is 13.2 THz, the frequency shift of the Raman scattering photons is quite large. The Brillouin scattering is also an inelastic collision in the interactions between the incident photon and fiber molecules. Because the frequency of acoustic phonons is around 11 GHz, the frequency shift of the Brillouin scattering photons is smaller compared to the Raman scattering. Besides, the most predominant characteristic of the Raman gain is its broad frequency range (40 THz) and large peak linewidth (about 5 THz) in the center of the frequency shift. The coefficient of the Raman gain is small (about 7\u00d710 -14 m/W), and the stimulated threshold power is high.

This \"difference step\" phenomenon in the time domain reflection curve of the backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering light and backward Stokes Raman scattering light of the fiber is generated. In distributed fiber Raman temperature sensors, we usually use the backward Stokes Raman scattering light of the time domain signal to demodulate the back anti-Stokes Raman scattering light of the time domain signal of the fiber and to get the temperature information of the fiber. The \"difference step\" phenomenon reduces the spatial resolution and the temperature measurement precision of the system. Since the fiber loss of different wavelength regions is different, there are spectral effects of the fiber loss. When using the Stokes Raman reference channel to demodulate the anti-Stokes Raman signal in the temperature measurement, the temperature demodulation curve becomes tilted and aberrant. Then it causes temperature measurement errors and reduces temperature measurement precision. On the other hand, bending, compressing and stretching of the fibers are easy to cause fiber nonlinear phenomena and result in the difference of the loss of each wavelength region, and the location of the optical cable is random.

On the foundation of not affecting the spatial resolution of the system, the backward signal strength of the fiber can be improved greatly; thereby, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system is improved, and the nonlinear effect of the fiber is repressed effectively. Because of using encoding and decoding technologies, it improves the ability of the extraction and distinction of the system's signal. Using the same signal averaging time, we can obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio. The improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio obtained by N bits of the sequence pulse is determined by (23).

It is called the fiber Raman frequency shift, according to which we can make a Raman frequency shifter. A pulse laser has the center wavelength of 1550 nm and the spectrum width of 0.1 nm. The width of the laser pulse is 10 ns with the peak power of 1W -1kW that can be adjusted, and its repeated frequency is 500 Hz-20 kHz. Because different fiber lengths have different conversion efficiencies, the best length of the fiber of the Raman frequency shifter is 1 km. The peak power of the 1660-nm broadband Stokes Raman shifter increases with an increase in the pump power of the fiber. When the pump power reaches or surpasses the threshold power of the fiber stimulated Raman scattering, the intensity of the Raman shifter increases significantly. At this time, most of the pump power can be converted to the Stokes Raman light and result in the Raman amplification phenomenon. Along with an increase in the pump power, the saturation phenomenon of the peak power of the Raman shifter will emerge. If the pump power continues to increase, the second-order Raman phenomenon will appear. The spectra of the optical fiber Raman frequency shifter device in different pump powers are shown in Fig. 9.

Horiguchi proposed a type of the BOTDA, which added a coherent pump in the end of the fiber, in order to realize a Brillouin amplifier.

But the BOTDA system needs to lock the frequency difference of the probing laser and the pumping laser strictly, and it is technically difficult to control.",

Zhang team proposed a new BOTDA system, which was based on the broadband nonlinear amplifying effect, temperature and strain effects of Brillouin scattering, and the principle of the optical time domain analyzer. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11, which contains a narrow linewidth single frequency fiber laser, a fiber splitter, a pulse modulator, two fiber circulators, a heterodyne receiver, a DSP, a fiber grating filter, single mode fibers, and a Raman pump laser. In the experiment, a high power Raman laser was used as the pump laser, which avoided the difficulty of locking the frequency difference of the probing laser and the pumping laser strictly, and the broadband fiber nonlinear scattering amplifier was utilized to replace the narrow-band fiber Brillouin amplifier. Therefore, the gain of the backward Brillouin scattering signal increased. The signal to noise ratio was improved, and the sensing length could reach 30 km. The strain resolution and temperature resolution were also improved simultaneously. A tunable narrow band semiconductor external cavity laser (ECL) is used as the signal source of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). Its wavelength is 1550 nm and linewidth is less than 10 MHz. The erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is used to amplify the continue wave (CW) laser of the ECL. The amplified light passes through the electro-optical modulator (EOM) to generate the laser pulse with the narrow line width and high power by using a 50:50 optical fiber coupler, which is used as the SBS pump of 1550 nm. Then the polarization correlation of the laser pulse is reduced by a polarization scrambler, the laser pulse is injected into the sensing fiber through the optical fiber circulator C1 through the coupler acting as the reference light of the coherent detection for the Brillouin signal, and passes through the fiber circulator C2 after a fiber Bragg grating BG1. The Rayleigh scattering light of the backscattering signal is filtered by a narrow line width fiber Bragg grating BG2 through C1, and then the rest backscattering light passes through C2. Finally, the Brillouin backscattering signal can be obtained at the position of BG1, which enters into the coherent detection system of the Brillouin scattering signal through C2, and the strain information is obtained by the optical demodulation of the probe signal and the Brillouin frequency demodulation. The Raman pump is employed to amplify the Brillouin scattering signal. The ultra-long distance strain sensing of the Brillouin signal using the effect of the Raman amplifier to avoid the power loss caused by long distance transmission can be realized. The noise suppression of this system mainly depends on BG1 and BG2. BG1 with a reflection bandwidth of 0.1 nm only reflects the Stokes Brillouin scattering signal around 1550 nm, and BG2 can further control the Rayleigh scattering signal caused by the Raman pump laser operating at 1465 nm. The WDM also restrains the noise effectively. The receiving part detector improves the signal to noise ratio, picks up the useful signals by utilizing cumulative averaging and low-pass filtering, and meanwhile matches up with BOXCAR sample integration."

The sensor system was based on the hybrid principle of the spontaneous Raman scattering, the stimulated Raman scattering, and the stimulated Brillouin scattering. It combined the distributed fiber Raman temperature sensor, the distributed fiber Brillouin sensor, and the distributed fiber Raman amplifier and then formed a new ultra-long distance distributed fiber temperature and strain sensor. The temperature information was obtained by detecting the intensity ratio between the anti-Stokes Raman scattering and the Stokes Raman scattering, which were injected into the detecting system through two band pass filters. The strain distribution information along the fiber was acquired by detecting the Brillouin frequency shift, which was caused by coherently detecting the backward Brillouin scattering signal through a fiber grating filter and the local narrow-band oscillation laser. By combining the fiber Raman amplifier, the signal to noise ratio could be improved. Especially, the sensor system used two probing light sources: one was a broadband Fabry-Perot (F-P) laser diode operating at 1550 nm, which was used as the probing laser of the fiber Raman scattering sensor; the other was a 1555-nm narrow band external cavity ECL laser, which acted as the probing laser of the fiber Brillouin scattering sensor. The pump source of the fiber Raman amplifier was a high power tunable fiber Raman laser with the central wavelength of 1465 nm. The single mode sensing fiber was 100 km long, and the temperature resolution was \u00b12 . The \u2103 experimental setup is shown in Fig. 12.

The light of the wide bandwidth fiber laser (WFL) is amplified by an EDFA and injected into the ultra-long distance single mode sensing fiber through a polarization scrambler and a WDM. The backscattering signal in return passes the fiber splitter, a narrow bandwidth reflection filter and the WDM which restrains the Rayleigh scattering caused by the 1465-m Raman pump laser. The backward signal passes through the Raman signal detecting system which is used to receive and amplify the photo-electricity, and then it is injected into the PC control center for demodulation. The position information of temperatures and strains along the sensing fiber is thus obtained. The operation wavelength of the Raman pump laser is 1551.83 nm. The spectral bandwidth is 0.067 nm, and the power can be tuned from 0 to 1200 mW. Another laser is a narrow bandwidth fiber laser (NFL) which is amplified by the EDFA, and injected into the sensing fiber through the polarization scrambler and the WDM. The backward signal passes through the fiber splitter, the narrow bandwidth reflection filter, and the WDM. The signal of SBS frequency shifts is acquired by detecting the beat frequency, which is caused by coherently detecting the SBS backscattering signal through C1 and the local NFL laser signal. Finally, it is sent to the PC control center for further analysis to achieve the strain information along the fiber. This sensor system has been granted a China Invention Patent."
