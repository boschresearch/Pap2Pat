    "abstract": "A dispersion and loss spectrum auto-correction distributed optical fiber Raman temperature sensor has a dual fiber pulsed laser module with dual Raman wavelength shifts. The laser module is composed of a power supply (11), an electronic switch (12), a primary laser (13) and a secondary laser (14), a first combiner (15), a bidirectional coupler (16), a multimode fiber (17), an integrated optical fiber wavelength division multiplexer (18), a second combiner (19), a direct detection system (20), a signal collection and processing system (21) and a display (22). The sensor uses two light sources that have two Raman wavelength shifts, wherein the central wavelength of backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering peak of the primary light source coincides with that of the backward Stokes scattering peak centre wavelength of the secondary light source, and the time domain reflection signal of the one-way optical fiber Rayleigh scattering is deducted. Based on the optical fiber Raman scattering temperature measurement principle, the dispersion and loss spectrum auto-correction method and the optical time domain reflection principle, the optical fiber dispersion and the loss spectrum can be self-corrected, and the random power loss caused by bending and stretching in installation can also be auto-corrected.",

                        "In recent years, by means of the temperature modulation effect of optical fiber Raman scattering light intensities and the optical time domain reflection (OTDR) principle, distributed optical fiber Raman temperature sensors have been developed. They can be used to measure the on-site temperature in real time, predict the temperature change trend, monitor the on-site temperature change and provide on-line temperature alarming when the measured temperature is over a certain range. The distributed optical fiber Raman temperature sensor is a linear temperature response detector of safe type in nature and easy to build an optical fiber sensor network. It has been successfully applied in the fields of power industry, petrochemical enterprises, large scale civil engineering, on-line disaster monitoring, etc.",
                        "The optical fiber Raman scattering frequency shift is about 13.2 THz. So there is a relatively large wavelength difference between the anti-Stokes Raman scattering light and the Stokes Raman scattering light of the optical fiber. Due to the dispersion effect in optical fibers, the backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering light and the Stokes Raman scattering light have different transmission velocities in the optical fiber, thus leading to the \u201casynchronism\u201d or \u201cseparation\u201d phenomenon between the anti-Stokes Raman scattering light and the Stokes Raman scattering light in the time domain reflection curves. For distributed optical fiber Raman temperature sensors, the time domain reflection signal of the optical fiber backward Stokes Raman scattering light is used to demodulate the time domain reflection signal of the anti-Stokes Raman scattering light, in order to obtain temperature information of all segments of the optical fiber. However, the \u201casynchronism\u201d or \u201cseparation\u201d phenomenon happened in the two OTDR signals decreases the spatial resolution and temperature measurement precision of the sensor system, and even causes measurement errors. In a distributed optical fiber Raman temperature sensor, the anti-Stokes Raman scattering light is used as the temperature measurement signal channel, while the Stokes Raman scattering light is used as the temperature measurement reference channel. Since the two channels have quite different wavelength and the optical fiber attenuation losses are different for various wavelengths, they have different intensity losses. Therefore, when the Stokes Raman reference channel is used to demodulate the anti-Stokes Raman signal, the demodulated temperature curve presents a non-linear feature. This causes the temperature measurement errors and decreases the temperature measurement precision. Additionally, when optical fibers are installed on-site, they are very likely bent and stretched which leads to non-linear optical effects in optical fibers, and causes power losses at different wavelengths. Furthermore, since both the magnitude and the position of the bend and the stretch in pressing of the optical fiber and optical cable are random and unpredictable, it is difficult to correct the measurement manually. Thus, an auto-correction method is needed.",
                        "In 2007, Chung E. Lee et al proposed a solution: \u201cMethods and Apparatus for Dual Source Calibration for Distributed Temperature Systems\u201d which has been granted a U.S. patent right (No. US2007/0223556A1), wherein dual light sources are employed, and the optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave of the primary laser and the optical fiber Stokes Raman scattering wave of the secondary laser within the same waveband are alternately controlled by an optical fiber switch in a manner of time-division. The optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave of the primary laser is demodulated by the optical fiber Stokes Raman scattering wave of the secondary laser so as to obtain the temperature information of all segments of the optical fiber. In such round trip Raman scattering OTDR signals, though the return thereof fall within the same waveband, the wavelength of the incident waves lies in the primary laser wavelength and the secondary laser wavelength which differ from each other by a dual Raman shift, so that the influences of the optical fiber dispersion spectrum and the optical fiber loss spectrum cannot be eliminated completely."

The primary laser and the secondary laser are switched by the electronic switch with a set time interval to operate alternately.",
                        "The primary laser and the secondary laser in the dual fiber pulsed laser module having dual Raman shift wavelengths also can be other pairs unlike the above mentioned, such as 1660 nm and 1450 nm, 1064 nm and 980 nm, or others that meet the dual Raman shift difference requirement.",
                        "The wavelength difference between two lasers is the dual Raman shift wavelength difference. The two lasers are driven synchronously by the power supply with a repetition frequency of 8 kHz, and are alternately switched on by the electronic switch with a certain interval period (10 seconds, for example). The time-division dual-wavelengths fiber pulsed laser light switched by the electronic switch passes through the first combiner and the bidirectional coupler, and enters the multimode temperature sensing fiber. The backward Rayleigh scattering and Raman scattering echoes of the optical fiber enter the integrated optical fiber wavelength division multiplexer through the bidirectional coupler. At the first output port of the integrated optical fiber wavelength division multiplexer and the direct detection system, the time-division OTDR signals of optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave of the primary laser and optical fiber Stokes Raman scattering wave of the secondary laser within the same primary wavelength waveband are thus obtained. These round-trip OTDR signals, though their echoes are within the same waveband, have incident waves between the primary laser wavelength and the secondary laser wavelength which differ from each other by a dual Raman shift wavelength, and can not eliminate the effects due to the optical fiber refractive index and loss spectrum in different waveband. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize the signal collection and processing system to deduct the single-trip optical fiber Rayleigh wave OTDR signals of the primary and the secondary laser wavelength.",

The two single-trip optical fiber backward Rayleigh wave OTDR signals of the primary and the secondary laser wavelength at different wavebands are obtained by the signal collection and processing system, respectively. Then the single-trip optical fiber backward Rayleigh wave OTDR signal of the primary laser wavelength in the optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave OTDR signal of the primary laser and the single-trip optical fiber backward Rayleigh wave OTDR signal of the secondary laser wavelength in the optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave OTDR signal of the secondary laser wavelength are deducted respectively by means of the signal collection and processing system, obtaining the intensity ratio of single-trip optical fiber backward anti-Stokes Raman scattering wave OTDR signal of the primary laser with respect to single-trip optical fiber Stokes Raman scattering wave OTDR signal of the secondary laser which are within the same waveband, temperature information for each segment of the optical fiber is obtained based on the optical fiber Raman temperature measurement principle, achieving dispersion and loss spectrum auto-correction.",

The photon is referred to as a Stokes Raman photon after the photon emits a phonon during the scattering. The photon is referred to as an anti-Stokes Raman photon after the photon absorbs a phonon during the scattering. For optical fiber molecules, the optical phonon frequency is around 13.2 THz.
