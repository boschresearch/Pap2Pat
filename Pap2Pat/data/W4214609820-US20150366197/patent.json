                        "Marinopyrroles were first reported to show antibiotic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2008 (Hughes et al., \u201cThe marinopyrroles, antibiotics of an unprecedented structure class from a marine Streptomyces sp.\u201d Org Lett 10:629-631, 2008). Due to their novel class of molecular structures and promising biological properties, the marinopyrroles have attracted considerable attention. The first total synthesis of (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A was reported along with 12 derivatives in early 2010 (Cheng et al., \u201cTotal synthesis of (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A and its library as potential antibiotic and anticancer agents,\u201d J Comb Chem 12:541-547, 2010). Synthesis of (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A via an intermolecular Ullman coupling reaction as a key step to form bispyrrole system was published by Kanakis and Sarli five months later (Kanakis et al., \u201cTotal synthesis of (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A via copper-mediated N-arylation,\u201d Org Lett 12:4872-4875, 2010). In 2011, Nicolaou's group published a new five-step method to access marinopyrrole derivatives as well as (+)- and (\u2212)-atropisomer after a chiral separation of (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A using chiral HPLC and their antibiotic activities against MRSA (Nicolaou et al., \u201cTotal synthesis and biological evaluation of marinopyrrole A and analogues,\u201d Tet Lett 52:2041-2043, 2011). Recently, the synthesis of a novel series of \u201casymmetrical\u201d marinopyrrole derivatives with superior antibiotic activities against MRSA to that of the parent marinopyrrole A was revealed (Liu et al., \u201cMarinopyrrole derivatives as potential antibiotic agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (I),\u201d Mar Drugs 10:953-962, 2012). Most recently, Moore's group published biosynthesis of marinopyrrole A via a N,C-bipyrrole homocoupling catalyzed by two flavin-dependent halogenases (Yamanaka et al., \u201cFlavoenzyme-catalyzed atropo-selective n,c-bipyrrole homocoupling in marinopyrrole biosynthesis,\u201d J Am Chem Soc 134:12434-12437, 2012).",
                        "The global crisis of antibiotic resistance has spread rapidly over the last several decades. MRSA infections have reached epidemic proportions in many countries and represent the most common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States (Grundmann et al., \u201cEmergence and resurgence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as a public-health threat,\u201d Lancet 368:874-885, 2006; Como-Sabetti et al., \u201cCommunity-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: trends in case and isolate characteristics from six years of prospective surveillance,\u201d Public Health Rep 124:427-435, 2009). Both hospital-associated and community-associated MRSA can exhibit broader resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics (Chambers et al., \u201cWaves of resistance: Staphylococcus aureus in the antibiotic era,\u201d Nat Rev Microbiol 7:629-641, 2009; Deleo et al., \u201cCommunity-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,\u201d Lancet 375:1557-1568, 2010; Lowy, \u201cAntimicrobial resistance: the example of Staphylococcus aureus,\u201d J Clin Invest 111:1265-1273, 2003). Hospital-associated MRSA infections are common among healthcare facilities and are resistant to many antibiotics. However, community-associated MRSA strains are highly virulent and infect even healthy individuals; the incidence of these infections has skyrocketed in the last decade. The relative abandonment of antibiotic discovery and development by the pharmaceutical industry has created a vacuum in the introduction of new antibiotics to treat these increasingly problematic infections. Except for the addition of the oxazolidinone linezolid in 2000, the lipopeptide daptomycin in 2003, and FDA's recent approval of ceftaroline (Teflaro) as an injectable antibiotic to treat adults with community acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections including MRSA, a very limited number of new antibiotics have been discovered over the last half a century, with only two new classes of anti-MRSA drugs having been approved in the last 40 years. Clearly, novel agents for the treatment of MRSA infections are urgently needed (Butler et al., \u201cNatural products\u2014the future scaffolds for novel antibiotics?\u201d Biochem Pharmacol 71:919-929, 2006). The compositions and methods disclosed herein address these and other needs."

Diketone 38 was obtained after oxidation of 37 with IBX in DMSO in 84% yield. Removal of tosyl group in 38 afforded 39 which was then subjected to demethylation using BBr3 in DCM in 82% yield. The final compound 41 was obtained after tetrachlorination of 40 with NCS in MeCN.",

This is achieved through structural information and computer modeling. Computer modeling technology allows visualization of the three-dimensional atomic structure of a selected molecule and the rational design of new compounds that will interact with a bacterial enzyme. The three-dimensional construct of the enzyme typically depends on data from x-ray crystallographic analyses or NMR imaging of the selected molecule. The molecular dynamics require force field data (e.g., Merck Molecular Force Field). The computer graphics systems enable prediction of how a new compound will link to the enzyme and allow experimental manipulation of the structures of the compound to perfect binding specificity. Prediction of what the interactions will be when small changes are made in one or both requires molecular mechanics software and computationally intensive computers, usually coupled with user-friendly, menu-driven interfaces between the molecular design program and the user.",

                                "A series of symmetrical marinopyrrole derivatives was designed with substitutions in both ortho- and para-positions of both phenyl rings. Without knowing where these marinopyrroles bind, thoughtful design of derivatives to cover electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups as well as the size of functional groups can be very beneficial to obtain meaningful SAR information and guide further optimization. Compound 19 was designed and synthesized (Scheme 2) based on the SAR result obtained from compound 1m. Compound 24 bearing two hydroxyl groups in both ortho- and para-positions was designed and synthesized (Scheme 3) to probe if additional hydrogen bond donors are present in both ortho- and para-positions near the protein targets. While the ortho-hydroxyl group was kept constant as critical requirement for activity, a para-substitution using S to connect functional groups for optimization was performed. The same rationale applied for compound 31 possessing two carboxylic acid function groups in para-positions to seek whether hydrogen bond acceptors are present in that positions near the targets. Compound 26 with benzylthio groups in both para-positions was designed to test if potential hydrophobic interactions exist in the extended areas of the para-positions. Methoxy groups in the para-position of benzylthio moiety of 26 were added to generate compound 27, which aimed to probe additional hydrogen bond donors of the targets in further extended areas. Oxidation of 25-27 furnished the corresponding solfones 28-30, which are designed to answer additional questions if the electronic effects of the latter improve the activity and/or whether the terminal groups (COOEt, Ph, 4-MeOPh) have any effects on activity. For the same reason, compound 32 as a sulfone in stead of sulfide was designed to answer additional questions to that from 31. Compound 41 was designed and synthesized (Scheme 4) based on the SAR information obtained from compound 1 (marinopyrrole A) and 1k. As shown in Table 1, compound 1k demonstrated activity against MRSE in the range similar to that of 1 while more potent than that of vancomycin although 1k showed much lower activity against the rest of pathogens.",

Except for those marked with WHO, all pathogens were isolated between 2008 and 2010 in hospitals located in Beijing; Guangzhou; Sichuan, Shandong and Jiangsu Province. Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was done by the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, Performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, seventeenth informational supplement. 2007, 27, M100-S17). The susceptibility tests of a bacterial strain to a marinopyrrole derivative were performed by an agar dilution method. Briefly, each sterile petri dish contained a final volume of 15 mL comprising 1 mL of a marinopyrrole derivative and 14 mL of Mueller-Hinton broth. The concentrations of a marinopyrrole derivative are 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.06, 0.03, 0.015 and 0.008 \u03bcg/mL. The petri dish containing the broth with different concentration of antibiotics was first inoculated with 105 CFU/mL (Denley A400, United Kingdom) and the culture was then incubated with shaking at 35-37\u00b0 C. for 18-20 h. The potency of the compound was determined and expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in \u03bcg/mL.

                        "The de-halogenated precursor of 1, which lacks the tetrachloro-substituents on the bispyrrole, exhibited >64 fold lower activity (MIC>32 \u03bcg/mL) against the pathogens tested. This result indicates that four chloro atoms on the pyrrole rings play an important role for antibiotic activity. The hydroxyl group in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring is critical. Replacement of the hydroxyl group with other substituents such as H, F, OMe, or CF3 led to lower activity or to a complete loss of activity (cf., 1c, 1d, 1g, 1j and 1n, Table 1). Besides forming an internal hydrogen bond with the ketone moiety, the hydroxyl group in 1 probably serves as a hydrogen bond donor rather than a hydrogen bond acceptor when binding to the targets, because compounds 1c, 1g and 1n, which possess a hydrogen bond acceptor, showed significant loss of activity. An electron-withdrawing group seems to be tolerated in the meta- and para-positions of the phenyl ring and the size of the substituent is less important (cf., 1d, 1e, 1f, 1h, 1i, and 1k). Compound 1k, which bears the strong electron-withdrawing group CF3 in the para-position and lacks the key hydroxyl group in the ortho-position, exhibited the most potent activity against MRSE compared with the parent compound 1, vancomycin, and other derivatives. Although an electron-donating group in the para-position may reduce potency, compound 1m also bearing a hydroxyl group in the ortho-position, nevertheless showed comparable activities against the tested pathogens MSSA, MRSA, ORSA, MRSE, and VRE when compared with 1. This result reinforces further that the hydroxyl group in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring is pivotal. All compounds are inactive against gram-negative pathogens K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli.",
                        "The parent compound 1 exhibited the potency similar to that of vancomycin against the clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and non-clinical isolates of MRSA (WHO-31) and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA, WHO-25). Design and synthesis of marinopyrrole A derivatives based on the initial results of SAR studies led to novel derivatives 19, 24-32 and 41 with modified chemistries vide supra. Among these derivatives as shown in Table 2, compound 19 showed 4-16 fold decreased potency against MRSA and 2-16 fold against MRSE, respectively, compared with compound 1m. The only structural difference is the para-hydroxyl (19) and para-methoxy (1m) substitution on the phenyl groups. Although this result suggests a hydrogen bond acceptor in the para-position might be favoured, it was not supported by compounds 24-32. Compound 24 bearing the same para-hydroxyl but lacking meta-chloro when compared with 19 exhibited similar potency to that of 1m. Compounds 25-32 with either thioether or sulfone group in the para-positions exhibited no antibiotic activity (MIC>32 \u03bcg/mL) against MSSA or MRSA regardless whether with or without the extended functional groups were attached. However, compound 41 (Scheme 4) with a strong electron-withdrawing group, CF3, in the para-position exhibited the most potent antibiotic activity. As shown in Table 2, compound 41 is 8 fold and 4 fold more potent than vancomycin and marinopyrrole A against MSSA, respectively. Compound 41 is also 2-4 fold more potent than both vancomycin and marinopyrrole A against MRSA. Most significantly, compound 41 with MIC of 8 ng/mL is >62 fold and >31 fold more potent than vancomycin and marinopyrrole A against MRSE, respectively.",

The efforts were focused on improving antibiotic potency with chemistry focused on synthetic strategy and route optimization. The methods paved the way towards diverse sets of both symmetrical and potentially asymmetrical marinopyrroles and circumvented the low yields due to the formation of byproduct oxazepine 5 encountered from the first total synthesis.2 The parent compound, (\u00b1)-marinopyrrole A, not only showed potent activity comparable to that of vancomycin against MRSA and MRSE, but it also exhibited higher potency (128-256 fold) than vancomycin against moderately resistant VRE (Table 1). SAR studies of derivatives have clearly demonstrated that the tetrachloro substituents on the pyrrole rings, the hydroxyl group in the ortho position and an electron-withdrawing group in the meta or para position on the phenyl rings are important for achieving potent antibacterial activity against the gram-positive pathogens tested. Of particular interests, the best compound 41 showed 63-125 fold, 8 fold and 4-8 fold more potent than vancomycin, in addition to 31\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 more potent than the parent marinopyrrole A (1), against MRSE, MSSA and MRSA, respectively (Table 3). These results provide useful information for further optimization in the search for new-generation antibiotics against MRSA, MRSE and other pathogens. The SAR studies show that compound 41 has superior antibiotic activity to that of vancomycin against a broad spectrum of gram-positive pathogens."
