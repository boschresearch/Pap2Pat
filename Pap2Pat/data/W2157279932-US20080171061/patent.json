                        "Human endogenous retrovirus sequences make up 8.29% of the draft human genome. Their prevalence has resulted from the accumulation of past retroviral infectious agents that have entered the germline and established a truce with the host cell. Genes co-opted by the host from endogenous retroviruses are found to be active participants in some cellular processes including viral defense by Fv1 and Fv4 in the mouse, and cellular fusion in human placental development mediated through syncitin. Although-HERV transcripts have been detected in both normal and cancerous tissues, including T cells, their role in normal cell function and carcinogenesis is unclear. While the cellular conditions that promote HERV transcription are not well understood, the APOBECs have been shown to play a role in the control of endogenous retroviruses."

Representative examples of such vehicles include viral vectors, nucleic acid expression vectors, naked DNA, and certain eukaryotic cells (e.g., producer cells).",
                        "\u201cOperably linked\u201d refers to an arrangement of elements wherein the components so described are configured so as to perform their usual function. Thus, control elements operably linked to a coding sequence are capable of effecting the expression of the coding sequence. The control elements need not be contiguous with the coding sequence, so long as they function to direct the expression thereof. Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet transcribed sequences can be present between a promoter sequence and the coding sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered \u201coperably linked\u201d to the coding sequence.",

In some embodiments, a compound is substantially pure when it is at least 50% to 60%, by weight, free from organic molecules with which it is naturally associated or with which it is associated during manufacture. In some embodiments, the preparation is at least 75%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99%, by weight, of the compound of interest. A substantially pure compound can be obtained, for example, by extraction from a natural source (e.g., bacteria), by chemically synthesizing a compound, or by a combination of purification and chemical modification. A substantially pure compound can also be obtained by, for example, enriching a sample having a compound that binds an antibody of interest. Purity can be measured by any appropriate method, e.g., chromatography, mass spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography analysis, etc.",

Epitopes of this kind are referred to as conformational or discontinuous epitopes, since the site is composed of segments of the polymer that are discontinuous in the linear sequence but are continuous in the folded conformation(s). Epitopes that are composed of single segments of biopolymers or other molecules are termed continuous or linear epitopes. T cell epitopes are generally linear peptides. Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be identified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen.",

                                "In some embodiments, a subject isolated HERV polypeptide is multimerized, e.g., two or more HERV polypeptides are linked in tandem. Multimers include dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers, etc. Monomeric HERV polypeptides are linked to one another directly or via a linker. Thus, in some embodiments, a subject HERV polypeptide has the formula (X1\u2014(Y)0-40\u2014X2\u2014(Y)0-40)n, where X1 and X2 are HERV polypeptides, Y is a linker, and n is an integer from to about 10 (e.g., n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10). Where a linker is used, Y is one or more amino acids, or other linking groups. X1 and X2 can be the same or different, e.g., can have the same amino acid sequence, or can differ from one another in amino acid sequence. Thus, e.g., a subject HERV polypeptide can have the formula X1\u2014(Y)0-40\u2014X2, e.g., where the HERV polypeptide is a dimer. As another example, a subject HERV polypeptide can have the formula X1\u2014(Y)0-40\u2014X2\u2014(Y)0-40\u2014X3, e.g., where the HERV polypeptide is a trimer.",
                                "Where Y is a spacer peptide, it is generally of a flexible nature, although other chemical linkages are not excluded. Currently, it is contemplated that the most useful linker sequences will generally be peptides of between about 2 and about 40 amino acids in length, e.g., from about 2 amino acids to about 10 amino acids, from about 10 amino acids to about 20 amino acids, or from about 6 amino acids to about 25 amino acids in length. These linkers are generally produced by using synthetic, linker-encoding oligonucleotides to couple the proteins. Peptide linkers with a degree of flexibility will generally be used. The linking peptides may have virtually any amino acid sequence, bearing in mind that the preferred linkers will have a sequence that results in a generally flexible peptide. The use of small amino acids, such as glycine and alanine, are of use in creating a flexible peptide. Exemplary peptide linkers include (Gly)2-40, (Ser)2-40, and (Ala)2-40. The creation of such sequences is routine to those of skill in the art. A variety of different linkers are commercially available and are considered suitable for use according to the present invention. However, any flexible linker generally between about 2 amino acids and about 40 amino acids, e.g., from about 6 amino acids to about 10 amino acids in length may be used. Linkers may have virtually any sequence that results in a generally flexible peptide.",
                                "Linkages for homo- or hetero-polymers or for coupling to carriers can be provided in a variety of ways. For example, cysteine residues can be added at both the amino- and carboxyl-termini, where the peptides are covalently bonded via controlled oxidation of the cysteine residues. Also useful are a large number of heterobifunctional agents which generate a disulfide link at one functional group end and a peptide link at the other, including N-succidimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) proprionate (SPDP). This reagent creates a disulfide linkage between itself and a cysteine residue in one protein and an amide linkage through the amino on a lysine or other free amino group in the other. A variety of such disulfide/amide forming agents are known. See, for example, Immun. Rev. 62:185 (1982). Other bifunctional coupling agents form a thioether rather than a disulfide linkage. Many of these thioether forming agents are commercially available and include reactive esters of 6-maleimidocaproic acid, 2 bromoacetic acid, 2-iodoacetic acid, 4-(N-maleimido-methyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid and the like. The carboxyl groups can be activated by combining them with succinimide or 1-hydroxy-2-nitro-4-sulfonic acid, sodium salt. A particularly preferred coupling agent is succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). Of course, it will be understood that linkage should not substantially interfere with either of the linked groups to function for its intended use, e.g., as an immunogen."

This step destroys the ADPR-transferase activity of the toxin molecule, hence rendering it nontoxic. The non-reacted hydrazide group can be used to covalently couple a polypeptide to toxin A. Toxin A may also be coupled to a polypeptide using a carbodiimide reagent.",

                                "The methods by which a subject polypeptide is conjugated with a carrier include disulfide linkages through a C terminal peptide cysteine linkage, coupling with glutaraldehyde solution for two hours, coupling with tyrosine, or coupling with water soluble carbodiimide.",
                                "In some embodiments, a subject isolated HERV polypeptide is lipidated. Lipidation increases a cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to the peptide that is linked to the lipid. The lipid residue, such as palmitic acid or the like, is attached to the amino terminus of the peptide. The lipid can be attached directly to the peptide, or, indirectly via a linkage, such as a Ser-Ser, Gly, Gly-Gly, Ser linkage or the like. As another example, E. coli lipoprotein, such as tripalmitoyl-S-glycerylcysteinyl-seryl-serine (P3 CSS), can be used to prime specific CTL when covalently attached to the peptide. See, Deres et al., Nature 342:561-564 (1989). A HERV polypeptide can be conjugated with uncharged fatty acid residues of different chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation, ranging from acetic to stearic acid as well as to negatively charged succinyl residues via the appropriate carboxylic acid anhydrides. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,419,931.",
                                "A subject isolated HERV polypeptide may be conjugated directly or indirectly, e.g., via a linker molecule, to a carrier. A wide variety of linker molecules are known in the art and can be used in the conjugates. The linkage from the peptide to the carrier may be through a peptide reactive side chain, or the N- or C-terminus of the peptide. A linker may be an organic, inorganic, or semi-organic molecule, and may be a polymer of an organic molecule, an inorganic molecule, or a co-polymer comprising both inorganic and organic molecules.",
                                "If present, the linker molecules are generally of sufficient length to permit the HERV polypeptide and a linked carrier to allow some flexible movement between the HERV polypeptide and the carrier. The linker molecules are generally about 6-50 atoms long. The linker molecules may also be, for example, aryl acetylene, ethylene glycol oligomers containing 2-10 monomer units, diamines, diacids, amino acids, or combinations thereof. Other linker molecules which can bind to polypeptides may be used in light of this disclosure."

The amount of HERV-K transcripts in the plasma of HIV-1 positive individuals was greatly out of proportion to that of other non virion-associated cellular transcripts (\u03b2-actin), thus ruling out cellular debris as an etiology for these transcripts.

Given that these are also endogenous antigens, it is unclear whether the response will be immunogenic or tolerogenic in nature. It was hypothesized that in regions of HIV-1 that are highly similar to HERVs, tolerance to HERVs could impair the HIV-1-specific immune response. Cross-tolerance has recently been suggested as a mechanism hampering the body's ability to produce antibodies that neutralize HIV-1 due to their cross-reactivity with a self-antigen cardiolipin18. Although HIV-1 and endogenous retroviruses are phylogenetically distant19, the similarity between them was analyzed from the perspective of a T cell receptor, focusing on short regions of high similarity corresponding to the length of T cell epitopes (8-12 amino acids). These regions of similarity are typically rejected in standard phylogenetic analysis, as they are small enough to occur frequently by chance, without indicating any genetic relatedness. Because the T cell recognizes proteins in short peptides presented on HLA molecules, these regions of similarity have significance for the immune response (FIG. 2). Since reverse transcriptase is a highly conserved protein, we expected and observed both clustered and distributed amino acid identity. Less conserved proteins such as Gag showed primarily clustered amino acid identities.",

For each HIV-1/HERV peptide pairing, there were variable numbers of amino acids in common between the two peptides. High frequency HERV peptide responses were detected at low levels of amino acid identity to HIV-1 peptides, indicating that HERV-specific responses are generated independently.

One of the greatest difficulties in HIV-1 vaccine development is overcoming the mutability of the virus, which enables it to evade specific immune responses elicited with a vaccine. HERVs are genome-encoded elements; translation products produced from de-regulated transcription of HERV insertions is expected to be far less variable than HIV-1 proteins. If HERV antigen production and presentation is a consequence of HIV-1 infection of a cell, the HERV products serve as a stably recognizable surrogate marker signalling HIV-1 infection to the immune system. Educating the immune system to recognize the HERV surrogate marker through vaccination induces killing of HIV-1-infected cells, circumventing the need to recognize highly variable HIV-1 antigens."
