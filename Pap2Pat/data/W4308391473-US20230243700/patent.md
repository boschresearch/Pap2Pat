# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure belongs to the technical field of laser, and in particular relates to an approximation-free and iteration-free method for spectral analysis of an intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, a device and a medium.

## BACKGROUND

Optical frequency combs have brought revolutionary development to cutting-edge core technologies such as high-bandwidth laser communication, ultra-precision spectral analysis, and large-scale high-precision laser ranging due to their unique equal-spaced comb-like multispectral frequency domain characteristics. A single intensity or phase electro-optic modulator can convert a single-frequency CW laser into a comb-like signal with a plurality of equal-spaced modulation sidebands. An optical resonant cavity is used for enhancing the electro-optic modulation effect, which can increase the modulation sidebands and thus generate an optical frequency comb with a wider spectral range. The optical frequency comb repetition frequency generated by an optical frequency comb light source based on intracavity electro-optic modulation can be freely set and regulated within a range of several MHz to tens of GHz, so that the light source is an ideal optical frequency comb light source for realizing high bandwidth laser communication and all-optical arbitrary waveform generation.

In order to achieve the high-quality high bandwidth laser communication and the all-optical arbitrary waveform generation, it is required to accurately estimate the specific energy of each comb tooth in the optical frequency comb. Therefore, a high-precision optical frequency comb spectral analysis method is of great significance. The existing spectral analysis methods of an intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb are mainly divided into two types, both of which are firstly proposed by Japanese scholar M. Kourogi et al. [Wide-Span Optical Frequency Comb Generator for Accurate Optical Frequency Difference Measurement, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 1993, 29: 2693-2701] in 1993.

According to the first type of spectral analysis method of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, an accurate optical frequency comb spectrum is obtained by iteratively calculating the energy coupling between every two adjacent comb teeth in a cavity. Ideally, the simulation analysis of the method needs to calculate the energy coupling of infinite comb teeth to a specific comb tooth, and then use the updated energy of each comb tooth to calculate the energy coupling to the next comb tooth, so that the accurate spectral distribution of the optical frequency comb can be obtained through continuous iterative calculation. However, in the actual application process, the calculation can only be performed for a limited number of comb teeth, and the simulation error introduced by this will accumulate continuously with the iterative energy coupling effect between the comb teeth. If the number of the comb teeth involved in the calculation is too small, it is difficult for simulation accuracy to meet the requirement. If the number of the comb teeth involved in the simulation is increased, the simulation time will be greatly prolonged due to the iterative calculation process. Therefore, the authors who proposed the method admit that the analysis and calculation process is too complicated to give consideration to both simulation accuracy and efficiency. In the paper published by German scholar Richard P. Kovacich et al. [Short-pulse properties of optical frequency comb generators, Applied Optics, 2000, 39: 4372-4376], although the simulation process was accelerated by using matrix calculation, the core problem that the simulation error of the analysis method accumulates with the iterative calculation of the finite comb teeth is still not solved.

According to the second type of spectral analysis method of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, a working state of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb is limited to meet multiple mathematical approximation conditions, and an approximate optical frequency comb spectrum is further obtained. The simulation error is introduced by multiple mathematical approximations of the analysis method. More importantly, the preconditions for these approximations require that the incident laser frequency, the resonant frequency of the resonant cavity and the modulation frequency must be exactly matched. However, in the actual use process, it is difficult to guarantee the exact matching of the above three parameters even if they are stably controlled. Therefore, this type of analysis method is only suitable for ideal conditions. In real scenarios, the simulation error is unavoidable or even impossible to simulate.

To sum up, at present, the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb urgently needs a spectral analysis method that takes both accuracy and computational efficiency into account. In particular, there is lack of an approximation-free and iteration-free spectral analysis method for the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb.

It is obvious that the described embodiments are part of the embodiments of the present disclosure and not all of the embodiments. Based on the embodiments of the present disclosure, all other embodiments obtained by those of ordinary skill in the art without creative labor shall fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.

In conjunction with FIGS. 1 to 4, the present disclosure provides an approximation-free and iteration-free method for spectral analysis of an intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, and the method specifically includes the following steps:

step 1: a residual phase delay of a single propagation of laser in a resonant cavity is calculated according to an incident laser frequency of a light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, a resonant frequency of the resonant cavity, and an intracavity electro-optic modulation frequency in combination with intracavity material dispersion conditions;

step 2: outgoing transmission characteristics of the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb is analyzed, and corresponding outgoing laser electric field intensities En are obtained according to cyclic propagation times n in the resonant cavity, where due to electro-optic modulation in the resonant cavity, exponential terms of En contain trigonometric function coefficients;

step 3: the outgoing laser electric field intensities En corresponding to all the cyclic propagation times n are accumulated to obtain a complete outgoing laser electric field intensity E of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, where each exponential term of E also contains trigonometric function coefficients;

step 4: a Jacobi-Anger identical deformation is used to reduce the exponential terms, containing the trigonometric function coefficients, of E in step 3 to a cumulative sum of infinite harmonic terms based on a Bessel function in an approximate-free manner, so as to obtain a new outgoing laser electric field intensity El of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb;

step 5: the outgoing laser electric field intensity E′ of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb obtained in step 4 is regarded as a Fourier series, and an outgoing laser electric field intensity Ek′ of kth-order comb teeth is extracted;

step 6: a method of matrix calculation is used to multiply Ek′ in step 5 with its own conjugate to obtain an outgoing laser light intensity Ik of the kth-order comb teeth, and a spectrum of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb is accurately analyzed in accordance with the outgoing laser light intensity Ik; and

step 7: a current working state of the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb is determined by comparing a measured spectrum of the optical frequency comb according to the precise spectral analysis of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb in steps 1 to 6 and simulation results of a spectral envelope curve, and the subsequent optimization design and debugging are further guided.

A resonant cavity structure of the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb in step 1 is a linear cavity, a ring cavity, a folded cavity or a composite cavity.

An implementation way of the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb in step 1 is an electro-optic modulation optical frequency comb light source based on a discrete spatial optical device, an electro-optic modulation optical frequency comb light source based on an integrated optical fiber ring cavity, or an electro-optic modulation optical frequency comb light source based on an on-chip micro-resonant cavity.

The residual phase delay of the single propagation of the laser in the resonant cavity in step 1 comprises three types of residual phase delay: the first type of residual phase delay is a residual phase delay introduced due to a mismatch between the incident laser frequency and the resonant frequency of the resonant cavity; the second type of residual phase delay is a residual phase delay introduced due to a mismatch between the resonant frequency of the resonant cavity and the electro-optic modulation frequency; and the third type of residual phase delay is a residual phase delay introduced due to intracavity material dispersion.

The analysis of the outgoing transmission characteristics of the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb in step 2 is any one of the following four analyses: the first type is analysis of an outgoing transmission model based on a spatial double-mirror linear cavity; the second type is analysis of an outgoing transmission model based on a multi-mirror ring cavity; the third type is analysis of an outgoing transmission model based on the optical fiber ring cavity; and the fourth type is analysis of an outgoing transmission model based on the on-chip micro-resonant cavity.

The outgoing laser electric field intensity En in step 2 is either of the following two types: the first type is transmitted laser electric field intensity Etn; and the second type is reflected laser electric field intensity Ern.

The maximum value of the cyclic propagation times n in step 3 can be positive infinity in the actual physical process, but the infinite term cannot be calculated, so that the cyclic propagation times n must be limited. In order to avoid the influence of too little value of n on the spectral analysis accuracy of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, the laser electric field intensities En corresponding to different cyclic propagation times n should be calculated, and the laser light intensities In corresponding to the different cyclic propagation times n are obtained by multiplying En with its own conjugate; due to the existence of data truncation error, In gradually decreases to 0 with the increase of n value; and therefore, in step 3, the accumulation of the laser electric field intensities En should select all the cyclic propagation times n corresponding to laser light intensity In being greater than 0 which correspond to different cyclic propagation times n and obtained by multiplying En with its own conjugate.

A simulation calculation method of the outgoing laser light intensity Ik obtained by multiplying Ek′ in step 6 with its own conjugate is a direct calculation method or an indirect calculation method; the direct calculation method is a direct calculation method of repeatedly calling the Bessel function to generate a complete Ek′ and its conjugate, and performing matrix multiplication; and the indirect calculation method is an indirect calculation method of generating a complete Bessel function parameter set in advance, calling the parameter set to generate Ek′ and its conjugate, and only performing multiplication and cumulative operations.

Step 4: a Jacobi-Anger identical deformation is used to simplify the exponential terms, containing the trigonometric function coefficients, of Et in step 3 to a cumulative sum of infinite harmonic terms based on a Bessel function in an approximate-free manner, so as to obtain a new transmitted laser electric field intensity Et′ of the intracavity electro-optic phase modulation optical frequency comb, and Et′ can be expressed as:

\(\begin{matrix}
{E_{t}^{\prime} = {{E_{in}\left( {1 - R} \right)}{\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty}{R^{n}e^{- {j({{2n} + 1})}\phi_{F}}{\sum\limits_{k = {- \infty}}^{\infty}{{J_{k}\left\lbrack {\left( {{2n} + 1} \right)\beta} \right\rbrack}e^{- {jk}\omega_{m}t}}}}}}} & (4)
\end{matrix}\)

Jk[(2n+1)β] represents the first type of Bessel function with order of k and independent variable of (2n+1)β.

Step 5: the transmitted laser electric field intensity Et′ of the intracavity electro-optic phase modulation optical frequency comb obtained in step 4 is regarded as a Fourier series, and a transmitted laser electric field intensity Etk′ of kth-order comb teeth is extracted, and Etk′ can be expressed as:

\(\begin{matrix}
{E_{tk}^{\prime} = {{E_{in}\left( {1 - R} \right)}{\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty}{R^{n}{J_{k}\left\lbrack {\left( {{2n} + 1} \right)\beta} \right\rbrack}e^{{- {j({{2n} + 1})}}\phi_{F}}}}}} & (5)
\end{matrix}\)
