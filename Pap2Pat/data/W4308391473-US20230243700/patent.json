                        "Optical frequency combs have brought revolutionary development to cutting-edge core technologies such as high-bandwidth laser communication, ultra-precision spectral analysis, and large-scale high-precision laser ranging due to their unique equal-spaced comb-like multispectral frequency domain characteristics. A single intensity or phase electro-optic modulator can convert a single-frequency CW laser into a comb-like signal with a plurality of equal-spaced modulation sidebands. An optical resonant cavity is used for enhancing the electro-optic modulation effect, which can increase the modulation sidebands and thus generate an optical frequency comb with a wider spectral range. The optical frequency comb repetition frequency generated by an optical frequency comb light source based on intracavity electro-optic modulation can be freely set and regulated within a range of several MHz to tens of GHz, so that the light source is an ideal optical frequency comb light source for realizing high bandwidth laser communication and all-optical arbitrary waveform generation.",
                        "In order to achieve the high-quality high bandwidth laser communication and the all-optical arbitrary waveform generation, it is required to accurately estimate the specific energy of each comb tooth in the optical frequency comb. Therefore, a high-precision optical frequency comb spectral analysis method is of great significance. The existing spectral analysis methods of an intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb are mainly divided into two types, both of which are firstly proposed by Japanese scholar M. Kourogi et al. [Wide-Span Optical Frequency Comb Generator for Accurate Optical Frequency Difference Measurement, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 1993, 29: 2693-2701] in 1993.",
                        "According to the first type of spectral analysis method of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, an accurate optical frequency comb spectrum is obtained by iteratively calculating the energy coupling between every two adjacent comb teeth in a cavity. Ideally, the simulation analysis of the method needs to calculate the energy coupling of infinite comb teeth to a specific comb tooth, and then use the updated energy of each comb tooth to calculate the energy coupling to the next comb tooth, so that the accurate spectral distribution of the optical frequency comb can be obtained through continuous iterative calculation. However, in the actual application process, the calculation can only be performed for a limited number of comb teeth, and the simulation error introduced by this will accumulate continuously with the iterative energy coupling effect between the comb teeth. If the number of the comb teeth involved in the calculation is too small, it is difficult for simulation accuracy to meet the requirement. If the number of the comb teeth involved in the simulation is increased, the simulation time will be greatly prolonged due to the iterative calculation process. Therefore, the authors who proposed the method admit that the analysis and calculation process is too complicated to give consideration to both simulation accuracy and efficiency. In the paper published by German scholar Richard P. Kovacich et al. [Short-pulse properties of optical frequency comb generators, Applied Optics, 2000, 39: 4372-4376], although the simulation process was accelerated by using matrix calculation, the core problem that the simulation error of the analysis method accumulates with the iterative calculation of the finite comb teeth is still not solved.",
                        "According to the second type of spectral analysis method of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb, a working state of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb is limited to meet multiple mathematical approximation conditions, and an approximate optical frequency comb spectrum is further obtained. The simulation error is introduced by multiple mathematical approximations of the analysis method. More importantly, the preconditions for these approximations require that the incident laser frequency, the resonant frequency of the resonant cavity and the modulation frequency must be exactly matched. However, in the actual use process, it is difficult to guarantee the exact matching of the above three parameters even if they are stably controlled. Therefore, this type of analysis method is only suitable for ideal conditions. In real scenarios, the simulation error is unavoidable or even impossible to simulate.",
                        "To sum up, at present, the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb urgently needs a spectral analysis method that takes both accuracy and computational efficiency into account. In particular, there is lack of an approximation-free and iteration-free spectral analysis method for the light source of the intracavity electro-optic modulation type optical frequency comb."
