    "title": "Concentration Independent Modulation of Local Micromechanics in a Fibrin Gel",
    "date": "2011-05-23",
    "abstract": "Methods for tuning extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics in 3D cell culture that rely on increasing the concentration of either protein or cross-linking molecules fail to control important parameters such as pore size, ligand density, and molecular diffusivity. Alternatively, ECM stiffness can be modulated independently from protein concentration by mechanically loading the ECM. We have developed a novel device for generating stiffness gradients in naturally derived ECMs, where stiffness is tuned by inducing strain, while local mechanical properties are directly determined by laser tweezers based active microrheology (AMR). Hydrogel substrates polymerized within 35 mm diameter Petri dishes are strained non-uniformly by the precise rotation of an embedded cylindrical post, and exhibit a position-dependent stiffness with little to no modulation of local mesh geometry. Here we present the device in the context of fibrin hydrogels. First AMR is used to directly measure local micromechanics in unstrained hydrogels of increasing fibrin concentration. Changes in stiffness are then mapped within our device, where fibrin concentration is held constant. Fluorescence confocal imaging and orbital particle tracking are used to quantify structural changes in fibrin on the micro and nano levels respectively. The micromechanical strain stiffening measured by microrheology is not accompanied by ECM microstructural changes under our applied loads, as measured by confocal microscopy. However, super-resolution orbital tracking reveals nanostructural straightening, lengthening, and reduced movement of fibrin fibers. Furthermore, we show that aortic smooth muscle cells cultured within our device are morphologically sensitive to the induced mechanical gradient. Our results demonstrate a powerful cell culture tool that can be used in the study of mechanical effects on cellular physiology in naturally derived 3D ECM tissues.",

                "Hydrogels polymerized from natural, synthetic, or hybrid molecules are commonly used as ECMs for the study of cell-ECM interactions as well as for medically implantable biomaterials and potential scaffolds for tissue regeneration [1], [2]. The design of a hydrogel that mimics the physiological microenvironment requires consideration of a multitude of factors including micromechanical properties [3], [4], [5], biocompatibility, ligand concentration [6], biotransport kinetics, and pore size [7], [8], [9], [10]. Complex interactions between these factors contribute to the transduction of cellular signals, which in turn determines cell survival, proliferation, and phenotype. Uncovering the exact role of stiffness in regulating cells in 3D has proven to be difficult because tuning stiffness in a physiologically relevant system is non-trivial. While the bulk mechanics of 3D matrices can be made effectively more stiff by increasing ECM protein concentration or altering the molecular weight of monomers [6], [10], there is a resulting decrease in mesh pore size, and increase in cellular confinement, resistance to transport, and local concentration of ligand presented to cells cultured within [11]. Protein-polymer hybrid systems such as PEG-fibrinogen or collagen-agarose [12] allow one to tune stiffness independent from bulk ligand concentration [9], [13]. However, the mesh size of these systems is commonly much smaller than their naturally derived protein hydrogel counterparts, thus increasing both resistance to transport and cellular confinement as compared to naturally derived systems. While phenotypic changes have been demonstrated in such systems [14], their relevance is debatable in the context of understanding basic physiology.",
                "Our studies are performed in fibrin, a commonly used naturally occurring viscoelastic biopolymer. Fibrin is the polymerized form of the blood circulating protein fibrinogen, and is the predominant structural component of blood clots that form in response to injury. Fibrin hydrogels exhibit many interesting mechanical properties, including high extensibility [15] and negative compressibility [16], all while maintaining permeability and bulk structural integrity under proteolytic degradation and cellular contraction, making it an ideal substrate for the wound healing process. The molecular basis for fibrin's remarkable physical behavior [15], [17] has been investigated at the scale of individual fibers [18], [19], [20], networks of fibers [18], and within macro-scale hydrogels [21], [22]. A more complete understanding of the role of fibrin's astounding mechanical properties in disease and thrombosis [23], [24], [25], as well its function as a scaffold which drives tissue morphogenesis, will lead to better design strategies for tissue regeneration and engineering.",
                "An interesting property of naturally derived ECMs, such as fibrin, is their tendency to stiffen with stretch. In fact, most tissues persist in a stretched state. This so called \u201cmechanical homeostasis\u201d, where residual stress is present in the absence of any external load, was first demonstrated when excised blood vessels were shown to spring open as they were sliced axially [26]. The residual stress, or prestress, originates from cell contractile forces, which are mediated by actomyosin interactions within cells. Intracellular prestress has been demonstrated by the viscoelastic retraction of photoablated actin stress fibers followed by a decrease in contractility as assessed by traction force microscopy [27], [28], and by the observation that actin stress fibers within cells cultured on pre-stretched membranes buckle when stretch is released [29]. Importantly, cellular traction forces are sufficient to locally deform the ECM [30], whose stiffness is strain-dependent [31]. Therefore, the stiffness of biological ECMs can be tuned by external mechanical loads alone to study the effects of ECM stiffness on cell physiology in 3D.",
                "Here we present a simple cell culture device for generating stiffness gradients within naturally occurring ECMs. Our device generates a gradient in mechanical strain, which induces variable stiffness by the materials' non-linear mechanical properties. We demonstrate our ability to both measure and tune the stiffness within natural fibrin ECM hydrogels within our system, which is both biocompatible and mechanically instructive in the context of aortic smooth muscle cells."

                        "The orbital tracking method has been previously described [37]. Briefly, during each cycle of the tracking routine, the excitation beam traces a circular orbit in a given position around the fiber. The orbit's radius is equal to half the waist of the microscope point spread function (PSF). In the experiments reported in this work, each orbit is in the x-z plane and takes 8 ms. The acquisition rate is chosen such that 128 points are measured during each orbit. After each cycle of the tracking routine, the DC value, AC value, and phase of the first harmonic are calculated on-the-fly by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The modulation (defined as the ratio AC/DC) varies monotonically as the distance from the fiber to the center of the orbit is increased. For every measured value of modulation, we can calculate the distance of the fiber's center of mass from the center of the orbit to determine the coordinates of the fiber. The center of the orbit is relocated to the calculated center of mass. In other words, during the tracking routine the scanner follows the fiber's center of mass by changing its position to that calculated in the previous cycle. When the fiber position is determined with respect the x-z plane, the orbit is moved according to a linear ramp function incrementing the orbit position in the y-direction along the fiber and a new cycle of the tracking routine starts. Given the highly branched nature of the fibrin network, it is possible that tracking can erroneously deviate from one fiber to a neighboring fiber. As a control, we analyze orbit coordinates and fluorescence intensity as a function of time after tracking is complete. If the tracking jumps to a neighboring fiber, there will be an abrupt change in the modulation of the first harmonic and a spike in the intensity. Fibers were tracked a maximum distance of 10 \u00b5m over 120 seconds with a step size resolution of 56 nm. All measured fibers were located at least 3 \u00b5m above the cover slip to avoid surface effects. The y-position of the orbit was sequentially moved through approximately 1500 positions along each fiber. For display, the color of the reconstructed trajectory changes every 100 measured points."

AMR of fibrin gels measures a large variation in stiffness between microdomains in a single gel (Fig. 3A), while macrorheology measures an ensemble average, which is insensitive to the distribution in microdomain stiffness (Fig. 3B). Therefore, parallel plate rheology fails to report local heterogeneities in gel stiffness detectable by AMR. We found agreement between macro and microrheology of 2.5 mg/ml fibrin gels, but not for 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml fibrin, where microrheology reports a softer matrix than macrorheology (Table 1).

                        "The importance of measuring local stiffness is highlighted in Fig. 4, in which the material stiffness varies by a factor of 10 around the periphery of a single AoSMC cultured in a 3D fibrin gel, an observation not detectable by macrorheology. Furthermore, regions measured at the polar contracting ends of the cell (beads 2 and 6) are noticeably stiffer than those regions located along the length of its body (beads 3\u20135)."

                        "In our device, local gel stiffness was modulated by rotation of the post as measured in situ by AMR. We observed that stiffness could be modulated independent of initial fibrinogen concentration following a 2.4\u00b0 rotation of the post within a 2.5 mg/ml fibrin gel. For these conditions, FEA estimates a nonuniform distribution of shear strain within the Petri dish (Fig. 5A). Strain is greatest at the gel-post interface, decreasing radially in a steep gradient towards the edge of the dish. The eccentric placement of the post within the dish induces a large variation in strain ranging from 0.005 to 1.3. Parallel plate rheology (constant frequency) reports nonlinear strain stiffening for 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml fibrin gels, with the 2.5 mg/ml gels stiffening linearly for strains below 0.1 (Fig. 5B).",
                        "To directly measure the heterogeneity in stiffness within our device, we performed AMR at 30 positions throughout a region of the gel as indicated in Fig. 5C. At the center of each region, five neighboring microbeads were probed to determine the local distribution of G\u2032. We observed a pattern of stiffening consistent with our FEA model of strain and macroscopic measurement of strain stiffening. Importantly, we determined that the large endogenous variability in G\u2032 measured in unstressed gels could not account for the observed stiffening in our device, where the level of significance was relaxed to 0.15 for several regions. In further support of strain stiffening, we measured G for a single bead as the post was rotated by 0.0, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.4\u00b0 in both region R1 and R2 in Fig. 5D. AMR in R1 reported no significant strain stiffening of the matrix even at 2.4\u00b0 rotation of the post (Fig. 5D), a finding consistent with AFM studies of fibrin stiffness at low strain [31]. AMR in R2 reports both a 10-fold stiffening as well as hysteresis (Fig. 5D, E).",
                        "As shown above in Fig. 3A, AMR reports an increase in stiffness with increasing fibrin concentration in unstressed gels. This finding is consistent with the observed increase in mesh density (Fig. 6A, B, C) and formation of fiber bundles (Fig. 6C) by scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy. Surprisingly, examination of the 2.5 mg/ml fibrin mesh in R2 following rotation of the post by 2.4\u00b0 suggests a translation of the mesh with no significant change in pore geometry for strained gels (Fig. 6D). Measured pore volume decreased with increasing fibrin concentration in unstressed gels (p<0.05), but not in R2 following rotation of the post (p>0.05, Fig. 6E). Thus local stretch can induce 10-fold stiffening without large deformations in pore geometry as assessed by diffraction limited light confocal microscopy."

                        "To further investigate the mechanical basis of stiffening in R2, we implemented orbital tracking of fibers (Fig. 7A) with and without applied stretch. In the absence of stretch, fibers appear buckled and coiled at the nanometer-scale, implying a slack state. Following rotation of the post by 2.4\u00b0, individual fibers transition from coiled (Fig. 7B, C, top row) to straightened and elongated (Fig. 7B, C, bottom row) consistent with the conformational change of a rope-like fiber under tension. In support of increased fiber tension with stretch, the maximum value of the MSD of the fiber midpoint after 200 seconds decreased with rotation of the post from approximately 60,000 nm2 to 10,000 nm2 (Fig. 7D). Moreover, fibers in this region were observed to recover to their original conformation as the post was unrotated (data not shown), consistent with G\u2032 recovery measured by AMR (Fig. 5E)."

In particular, cells located less than approximately 200 \u00b5m from the post surface appear oriented with their long axis more tangent than normal to the surface of the post (Fig. 8B\u2013H).

                "We have presented a method for tuning the mechanical properties of naturally derived ECMs. Paramount to our method, we emphasize the need to measure material properties at the same length scale as cells. Typically, material stiffness is measured macroscopically where the material can be assumed to act as a continuum. In order for the continuum assumption to apply, the characteristic length scale of underlying structural components must be much smaller than that of the physical model [26]. In our system, fiber structure and architecture are near to the same scale as the cell itself, as evidenced by comparing the features of fibrin ECMs (Fig. 6A\u2013C) to the size of a single cell in Fig. 4. This compels us to probe the complex heterogeneous fibrous system by quantitative methods, such as AMR, to elucidate the role that local matrix stiffness plays in cellular physiology. Bulk measurements are in general insensitive to local micron scale heterogeneities, shown by the comparison between micro and macro scale rheology of fibrin gels polymerized at 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml (Fig. 3). While the increase in stiffness with fibrin concentration was expected, the discrepancy between AMR and macrorheology highlights the requirement of measuring local micromechanics, particularly given the significant overlap in microrheological stiffness of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml fibrin gels.",
                "The spatial variability in stiffness revealed by AMR is expected under the assumption that local viscous and elastic moduli are dependent upon local mesh geometry, which is notably heterogeneous (Fig. 6A). In addition, the stiffness of an ECM is subject to temporal variability as cells dynamically alter their microenvironment through remodeling and the generation of cytoskeletal traction forces. While it is likely that cells actively remodel the local matrix through protease activity [38] and the deposition of new ECM [39], it is also known that fibrin stiffness is modulated by cell-mediated mechanical stress as measured by AFM [31]. This is because fibrin gels exhibit strain stiffening, which is typical of soft biological materials [15]. It is important to note that methods of 3D traction force microscopy [40] applied to naturally derived materials [30] must include in situ real time measures of local stiffness since there will not be a simple relationship between bead displacement and cell forces when material properties are spatially and temporally variant. AMR's ability to track changes in local stiffness, in real time, make it an appropriate technique to complement 3D traction force microscopy.",
                "As implemented here, AMR measures ECM stiffness in a local volume just larger than the bead. As a result, AMR has micron resolution allowing spatial mapping of stiffness around a cell as it dynamically interacts with its ECM as shown in Figure 4. Here, the measured distribution of elastic moduli surrounding the cell implies it is exerting traction forces at its polar ends, which would cause local stretch-induced stiffening, consistent with observations of bead displacement for cells migrating in 3D [30]. Therefore, we assert that in order to generate a complete model of the role of ECM stiffness in cell regulation, we must map both the endogenous stiffness as well as local cell-mediated mechanical changes using a nondestructive method such as AMR.",
                "Our novel cell culture device enables users to tune the stiffness of naturally derived ECMs, while allowing for continuous optical observation and interrogation. We demonstrated that within a single 35 mm culture dish we could tune stiffness independent from matrix architecture in a naturally derived matrix such as fibrin. Local gel mechanics were altered, not through increased protein concentration or exogenous cross-linking, but by directly altering the tensile stress state of the gel's fiber network through the application of shear strain. In contrast to polymer-peptide hybrid systems, our device allows cell-cell communication of soluble factors through \u2018natural\u2019 pores, where interacting cells may independently experience very different mechanical microenvironments. As predicted by FEA, we observed a strong circumferential gradient in stiffness near to the post as well as regions far from the post in which the distribution of stiffness was unaltered. While the model in conjunction with parallel plate rheology predicts a smooth distribution in stiffness, AMR reports a noisy distribution (Fig. 5C) due to the large endogenous heterogeneity in mesh architecture. Furthermore, the differential stiffening observed in regions R1 and R2 (Fig. 5D) at varying degrees of rotation of the post highlight our ability to tune local mechanics by the application of strain. In high strain regions, we measured hysteresis in stiffness, where the original stiffness was entirely recoverable. This result is consistent with observations of fibrin's mechanical integrity under large strains [15].",
                "Surprisingly, we achieved a ten-fold stiffening within a 2.5 mg/ml fibrin gel as measured by AMR with no detectable change in pore geometry as measured by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 6D) and image analysis of pore volume (Fig. 6E). While we did not observe the expected collapse of pores or significant fiber alignment with the direction of stretch [15], we did detect straightening and elongation of fibers at the nanoscale by orbital tracking (Fig. 7). These nanostructural and mechanical changes measured in fibrin are consistent with recent multiscale theories claiming that fibrin's resiliency arises from molecular level extension and alignment [15], [17]. A plausible explanation of the observed stiffening is that the strain induced by rotation of the post engaged covalent bonds within fibrin fibers thus stiffening the matrix as reported by AMR.",
                "We observed differential AoSMCs alignment within our device suggesting cells were sensitive to the induced stiffness gradient. AoSMCs showed a strong circumferential alignment in the first few hundred microns from the post's surface. This is in agreement with FEA and AMR, which predicts circumferentially aligned principle strain, and reports strong circumferential gradients in stiffness respectively. Cells further from the post were randomly oriented, as were cells cultured in control dishes (data not shown). The random orientation of cells in these low strain regions is consistent with AMR results (Fig. 5C), which indicate that the distribution of stiffness was unaltered with the application of strain. This preliminary result suggests that cells can respond to stiffness gradients developed in naturally derived ECMs by the application of non-uniform stretch. Here we have demonstrated both the ability to measure and tune stiffness as well as the ability to image cell responses by diffraction limited fluorescence microscopy.",
                "In the context of available photonic technologies such as microrheology, confocal imaging, and multiphoton 3D particle tracking, as well as techniques not yet realized, this device provides an appropriate platform in which to study cell-ECM interactions while manipulating local mechanics of naturally derived ECMs without altering their composition. In this paper we have demonstrated the utility of this device in the context of fibrin, however, our device can be applied to many ECMs already in use by cell biologists such as those derived from collagen and agarose as well as commercial products such as Matrigel and custom designed protein-polymer hybrids."
