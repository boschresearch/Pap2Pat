                        "Myc is a family of regulator genes and proto-oncogenes that code for transcription factors, the most well-known example of which is c-myc. Other examples of Myc are 1-myc, and n-myc. In cancer, c-myc is often constitutively (and possibly persistently) expressed, which in turn leads to an increased expression of many other genes, some of which are thought to be involved in cell proliferation. Therefore, without being bound by theory, it is thought that the overall c-myc expression contributes to the formation of cancer. Constitutive up-regulation of Myc genes have also been observed in carcinoma of the cervix, colon, breast, lung and stomach. In the human genome, c-myc is believed to regulate expression of about 15% of all genes through binding on so-called enhancer box sequences (E-Boxes).",

Various compounds and drugs are not limited to a single effect and can therefore be considered to be inhibitors for a specific target, even if they are structurally different. That is to say, the inhibition of the specific target is the combining characteristic of these compounds.",

Any suitable type of c-Myc inhibitor can be used in conjunction with the subject matter disclosed herein, provided that it is capable of directly or indirectly inhibiting c-Myc within the nucleus.

In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor can be a polypeptide of any suitable sequence and length. In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor can comprise more two or more peptides fused to the tPE. The peptides can be the same or different from each other. In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor can comprise more two or more polypeptides fused to the tPE. The polypeptides can be the same or different from each other. In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor can comprise more two or more peptides and/or polypeptides fused to the tPE.

In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor is capable of disrupting c-Myc dependent pathways in c-Myc-dependent cancers. In some embodiments, the c-Myc inhibitor interferes with specific c-Myc DNA binding.

Following the leader peptide, PE has a receptor binding Domain Ia (amino acids 1 to 252) which is composed of antiparallel B-sheets, and Domain II (amino acids 253 to 364) with six consecutive a-helices, which enables it to translocate across cell membranes, for example, from the endoplasmatic reticulum to the cytosol. Following Domain II is Domain Ib (amino acids 365 to 404) and Domain III (amino acids 405 to 613). The last four residues (amino acids 400 to 404) of Domain Ib together with Domain III form the catalytic subunit of the toxin with ADP-ribosyltransferase activity."

                        "Hepatocarcinoma cells HepG2 that show a high sensitivity to tPE-H1 were treated with different doses of tPE-Omomyc and show a decrease in cell proliferation and a total absence of growth above 10 nM (FIG. 14). DRAQ7, a marker that specifically stains dead cells, showed a significant increase after 10 nM of tPE-Omomyc treatment after 24 hours (FIG. 15). In summary, the results obtained show that tPE-Omomyc has an even higher potency than tPE-H1. Specifically, tPE-Omomyc shows an EC50 value of 5 nM in luciferase assays; and 10 nM of tPE-Omomyc is able to stop the hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cell growth and induce cell death. All the cell lines tested were around 10 times more sensitive to tPE-H1 than tPE-Omomyc.",
                        "It is known in the art that the peptide Omomyc shows the ability to cross the plasma membrane passively, despite its intrinsic physico-chemical properties. Thus, Omomyc appears to be self-sufficient in its ability to target c-Myc without further peptides or localisation sequences to help with cellular internalisation.",
                        "In the present application, the fusion of H1 or Omomyc to tPE allows their delivery to the nucleus by following the NAE pathway and results in an unexpectedly low EC50 value of 25 nM and 5 nM, respectively. This is shown in the results of c-myc inhibition experiments with luciferase as utilised herein. Moreover, 100 nM of tPE-H1 and 10 nM tPE-Omomyc are sufficient to block HepG2 cell proliferation and induce cell death/apoptosis which is surprisingly low compared to previously described effect of Omomyc. Different promoter affinities account for specificity in MYC-dependent gene regulation. It is further shown in the art that Omomyc EC50 varies drastically between various assays, and a skilled person would appreciated that it is the hard to compare EC50 values when data is not generated using the same assay.",
                        "While it has been shown in the art that A549 cells which were treated with an Omomyc concentration of 10 \u03bcM showed apoptosis in cells, this is in contrast to the data shown in the present application in FIG. 15 (showing the cell mortality of cells treated with 10 nM of tPE-Omomyc), wherein it is shown that cells are sensitive to 10 nM of tPE-Omomyc. This also applies in different cell lines tested by the inventors (for example, but not limited to, HeLa, A431, MG63, MDA-MD231, and HCT116; data not shown), all of which were shown to be sensitive to tPE-Omomyc in a concentration of about 10 nM.",
                        "The mechanism for either H1 or Omomyc fused to tPE are the same. Omomyc has the ability to diffuse through the plasma membrane (thereby being capable of being found in the cytosol). H1 itself does not have this ability. Thus, in the present application, the inventors are forcing these peptides to take an alternative uptake route to bring these peptides into the nucleus.",
                        "It is known that the PE wildtype (wt) protein follows the retrograde traffic to reach the cytosol. It is known that payloads or cargo can be fused to PE domains Ia and II (tPE in the present application), thus enabling cytosolic delivery. It is known that the PE wildtype (wt) protein follows the NAE pathway to be translocated into the nucleus. However, no data has shown tPE to be transported to the nucleus. Also, previously, no data has shown that tPE when fused with a peptide or a protein results in the fusion peptide being transported into the nucleus.",
                        "With regard to the Omomyc fusion peptide as disclosed herein, one would have thought that adding the Omomyc peptide (10 kDa) to the tPE peptide (which is 40 kDa in size) would create a fusion protein of 50 kDa, which is known in the art to be too big to passively cross the nuclear pore complex. Therefore, one would not expect such a large protein of 50 kDa to be delivered to the nucleus, unless a nuclear localisation signal is added. In the same manner, tPE-H1 is about 42 kDa and is not able to passively cross the nuclear pore complex.",
                        "Moreover, a skilled person would have assumed that the kinetic for tPE to reach the cytosol via the retrograde trafficking would be around to 4 to 6 hours, and would require a \u03bcM concentration range in order to efficiently inhibit c-Myc in the nucleus.",
                        "A skilled person would have further assumed that the risk of tPE steric effect is high on both H1 and Omomyc, which in turn is expected to affect the affinity of any tPE fusion protein to the E-Box.",
                        "It was found by the inventors that Omomyc coupled with tPE reaches the nucleus within 1 hour of application. In the luciferase assay described herein, tPE-Omomyc results in an EC50 value of 5 nM and tPE-H1 EC50 value of 25 nM. It is further shown that 10 nM of tPE-Omomyc and 100 nM tPE-H1 are sufficient to completely inhibit hepatocarcinoma cell proliferation and induce cells death/apoptosis.",
                        "In view of what is known in the art, examples of which are outline above, the inventors have provided data which is unexpected in light of what is shown and described in the prior art with regard to the use of H1 and Omomyc.",
                        "The peptides, for example the H1 peptides as disclosed herein, showed activity in vivo when fused to tPE.

                        "In summary, both tPE-H1 and tPE-Omomyc were found to exhibit surprising efficacy against c-Myc. A H1 peptide conjugated to cell-targeting peptides could be expected, by a person skilled in the art, to function as well as tPE-H1. However, it has been shown when H1 was fused to two types of cell targeting peptides (Bac and SynB1), the reported effective concentrations were at \u02dc40 \u03bcM for C6 cell line cell killing. The present inventors tested a fusion peptide with the cell targeting peptides Int-H1, CAD-H1 and Tat-H1. The inventors observed some effects of Tat-H1 in the 500 \u03bcM range, CAD-H1 in the 75 \u03bcM range and int-H1 in the 200 \u03bcM range (see FIG. 7). By contrast, tPE-H1 was active at 25 nM. In fact, the inventors observed >90% decrease in Myc reporter activity after incubation with tPE-H1 50 nM and <75% decrease reporter activity with Tat-H1 at 1 mM, CAD-H1 at 150 \u03bcM and Int-H1 at 400 \u03bcM.",
                        "In sum, tPE-H1 was between 1000 and 10000 fold more efficient than H1 fused to cell targeting peptides, a result that could not have been predicted with the current state of knowledge. By way of an example, previously obtained data with int-H1 had been obtained using a commercial int-H1 construct. However, difficulties were observed when attempting to reproducing results using the commercial int-H1 construct as the expected effects were not observed. It was then decided to synthetize all the CPP to repeat the experiments and in order to ensure comparable synthesis conditions. Using this approach, the inventors obtained the results described herein.",
