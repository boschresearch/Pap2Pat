                        "Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases are diseases are conditions that involve an abnormal response of the immune system to normal organ systems. The abnormal immune response can involve both innate and adaptive immune cell responses and can involve multiple cell types like T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. These diseases can be systemic affecting multiple organ systems or be confined to a single organ. The causes of these diseases are often unknown; they can run in families or be associated with environmental triggers or infections. Treatment for these diseases will vary by disease and involve therapies that broadly suppress the immune system or can target arms of the immune system including T cells, B cells, cytokines, and complement. While many different immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of these inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, it is recognized that T cells play a central role in the initiation of the immune response and following inflammatory cascade. Further, T cells can also be pathogenic, traffic into tissues, secrete inflammatory cytokines, and recruit other inflammatory cells leading to tissue destruction and injury. There are over 80 autoimmune diseases with many of these diseases without FDA approved therapies. Given challenges with toxicities of drugs that suppress or modulate the immune system, biomarkers that can help identify patients most likely to responds to a given targeted therapy would have clinical utility in maximizing the benefit risk for population of patients with a given disease for a given therapy.",
                        "Lupus, a prototype of human systemic autoimmune disease, is characterized by a wide variety of multi-organ injuries. It is an autoimmune disease involving antibodies that attack connective tissue. The disease is estimated to affect nearly 1 million Americans, primarily women between the ages of 20-40. The principal form of lupus is a systemic one (systemic lupus erythematosus; SLE) and is associated with the production of anti-nuclear antibodies, circulating immune complexes, and activation of the complement system. While the pathogenesis of SLE is still not well understood, it is known that B cells, T-cells and monocytes are implicated in playing a critical role in the progression of the disease.",
                        "Specifically, there is a marked increase in polyclonal B-cell and T-cell activity and such increase can be characterized by the development of T-cells and antibody responses against a variety of self-antigens. It is theorized that the activation of T-cells stimulates the production of auto reactive B-cells to a specific epitope and then can spread to other epitopes. Such antibody response may include, as stated above, the production of autoantibodies against self-antigens such as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.",
                        "SLE can affect any organ system and can cause severe tissue damage. Untreated lupus can be fatal as it progresses from attack of skin and joints to internal organs, including lung, heart, and kidneys, with renal disease, termed lupus nephritis (LN), being the primary concern. Lupus mainly appears as a series of flare-ups (\u201cactive disease\u201d), with intervening periods of little or no disease manifestation (\u201cinactive disease\u201d).",
                        "LN is one of the most acute areas of damage associated with pathogenicity in SLE, and accounts for at least 50% of the mortality and morbidity of the disease. LN is a heterogeneous disease involving multiple different immune cell types that drive immuno-pathogenesis. FIG. 1. Currently, there are no entirely curative treatments for patients who have been diagnosed with SLE or LN. From a practical standpoint, physicians generally employ a number of powerful immunosuppressive drugs such as high-dose corticosteroids, e.g., prednisone, or azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, which are given during periods of flare-ups, but may also be given persistently for those who have experienced frequent flare-ups. Even with effective treatment, which reduces symptoms and prolongs life, many of these drugs have seriously harmful side effects that require careful management. In addition, some patients are resistant or refractory to steroid treatments.",
                        "Further adding to the complexity of LN disease-management is the abovementioned dynamic nature of the disease. For example, LN immuno-pathogenesis dynamically progresses in patients through different stages of T then B cell-driven disease, and understanding when the disease pathogenesis is, e.g., more T-cell-driven may inform temporally when therapeutic intervention is most likely to succeed, as disease progression might be preventable early-on, when T cell are initiating an immune response. Further, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the pathology may inform on the types of treatments that are most likely to be effective, thus, enabling targeted therapy that treats the underlying disease, rather than merely nonspecifically turning off or down the entire immune system with general immune suppressants or chemotherapies.",
                        "Drugs targeting B cells alone have failed to show significant or consistent efficacy in the treatment of LN, and although T cell targeting therapies have shown benefit, their use are limited by toxicities that may be due to the heterogeneity of the disease and due to less than optimal treatment regimens due to lack of reliable information regarding whether diseases are active or inactive.",
                        "Liver biopsies may inform on LN disease status and progression to some degree, but they are limited to infrequent use, and because disease may not be evenly distributed over the sampled organ, they are susceptible to variable results. Blood markers may be suitable for some indications, but are not always indicative of the biology happening locally in the tissue.",
                        "As such, there remains a need for more effective treatments against LN with fewer harmful side effects. Additionally, there remains a need for ways of monitoring SLE and LN disease progression to effectively inform when a patient is in an active disease state or is transitioning into an active disease state from an inactive state. Further, there is a great need in the art for precision therapy methods for identifying patients that might be treatable with a particular therapy for SLE or LN, so that the need for utilizing the shotgun approach of treating with powerful immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents may be reduced or eliminated. The present disclosure addresses these deficiencies."

                                "The present disclosure relates to methods of treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases or disorders (such as SLE or LN) in certain subsets of subjects that are determined to be candidates for a particular treatment (e.g., treatment with EQ001 and/or another inhibitor of the CD6-ALCAM pathway). In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides for the use of soluble CD6 protein, soluble ALCAM protein, or both as biomarkers indicative of active SLE, LN, or another inflammatory or autoimmune diseases or disorders disclosed herein or known in the art, and/or indicative of a patient's likelihood to respond favorably to a therapeutic intervention. The invention is based in part on the correlation of high soluble CD6 protein, high soluble ALCAM protein, or both with active T cell-driven inflammatory or autoimmune diseases or disorders (SLE or LN). High expression of one or both of these markers in a sample (e.g., a urine sample) from a patient that has, or is suspected of having, an inflammatory or autoimmune disease or disorder such as, e.g., SLE or LN may indicate increased signaling through the CD6-ALCAM pathway, which in turn informs that aberrant T-cell responses may underlie the active disease pathology.",
                                "CD6 is an important cell surface protein predominantly expressed by human T-cells and a subset of B-cells, as well as by some B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and neurons. CD6 is a member of a large family of proteins characterized by having at least one domain homologous to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain (SRCR) of type I macrophages. Blocking studies using anti-CD6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest that CD6 plays an important role in T-cell development by regulating T-cell adhesive interactions with thymic epithelial (TE) cells.",
                                "Additional studies have shown that CD6 can function as an important accessory molecule in T-cell activation. For example, certain anti-CD6 mAb are directly mitogenic for T-cells [1, 2], whereas others are able to co-stimulate T-cell proliferation in conjunction with anti-CD3, anti-CD2 or phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate (PMA) [1, 3, 4]. Yet additional evidence of the role of CD6 in T-cell activation comes from studies showing that CD6 becomes hyperphosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues [5, 6, 7] and phosphorylated on Tyr residues [8] following T-cell activation. These and other studies implicate CD6 as an important modulator of both immature and mature T-cell function in vivo, affecting both T-cell activation and signal transduction.",
                                "The extracellular domain of the mature CD6 protein is composed of three SRCR domains (hereinafter designated D1, D2, and D3). D3 corresponding to the membrane proximal SRCR domain followed by a short 33-amino acid stalk region. These extracellular domains are anchored to the cell membrane via a short transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic domain of variable length [13].",
                                "A soluble form of CD6 (sCD6) of unknown origin has been reported to circulate at very low levels (pico/nano molar range) in sera from healthy individuals has been reported [14]. Further, elevated levels of sCD6 were observed in individuals with systemic inflammatory response syndrome [15] and primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome [16], but direct mechanistic and functional relationships between these events are lacking. Reports suggest that sCD6 is formed by shedding of the membrane bound receptor via the proteolytic action of members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases. Further, although the functional role of sCD6 in T-cell physiology is not yet known, in vitro results suggest that sCD6 inhibits T cell activation and maturation of the immunological synapse prompting some investigators to posit that sCD6 acts as a decoy receptor to inactivate bystander T cells near a site of inflammation.",
                                "Studies using CD6-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, containing selected extracellular domains of CD6 fused to human IgG1 constant domains (CD6-Rgs), led to the identification and cloning of a CD6 ligand, designated \u201cactivated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule\u201d (ALCAM) also known as CD166 [9, 10].",
                                "ALCAM, is a 100-105 kD type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and comprises five extracellular immunoglobulin domains (2 NH2-terminal, membrane-distal variable-(V)-type (V1, V2 or D1, D2) and 3 membrane-proximal constant-(C2)-type Ig folds) [C1, C2, C3], a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The N-terminal domain (D1) is exclusively involved in ligand binding, whereas membrane proximal domains (C2, C3 or D4, D5) are required for homophilic interactions.",
                                "ALCAM binds to domain 3 of CD6 corresponding to the membrane proximal SRCR domain [11].",
                                "Studies of the role of CD6/ALCAM interactions in T-cell regulation have shown that this receptor-ligand pair is able to mediate the adhesion of CD6 expressing cells to thymic epithelial cells [10]. This and other evidence suggests that CD6/ALCAM interactions are important for modulating T-cell development and activation.",
                                "Moreover, ALCAM shedding has also been reported, and, like with sCD6, the process appears to be the product of ADAM family metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage. [17] Further, elevated levels of shed ALCAM has been reported in the urine of patients with bladder cancer, where it may serve as a prognostic biomarker of survival. [18] Moreover, in one report, elevated urinary ALCAM and VCAM were observed in SLE patients as compared to healthy patients, but ALCAM was not as highly elevated in active renal samples as compared to healthy samples, leading the investigators to conclude VCAM was a better marker. [19]",

In some embodiments, the inflammatory or autoimmune disease is selected from a neuroinflammatory disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, an inflammatory lung disease, an inflammatory kidney disease, and a systemic inflammatory disease. In some embodiments, the inflammatory or autoimmune disease is an inflammatory kidney disease. In some embodiments, the inflammatory kidney disease is selected from LN, IgA nephropathy, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis, autoimmune (formerly idiopathic) membranous nephropathy, anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis, and C3 nephropathy. In particular embodiments, the present disclosure provides such a method, wherein the method identifies whether a subject has a form of LN that is sensitive to CD6-ALCAM pathway inhibition based on the levels of soluble CD6 protein, soluble ALCAM protein, or both in a sample obtained from the subject (e.g., from the subject's urine). LN subjects (or SLE or inflammatory or autoimmune disease subject, more generally) found to have elevated levels (e.g., in their urine) of soluble CD6 protein, soluble ALCAM protein, or both may be more likely to have active T cell-driven disease. Moreover, by analyzing the basal concentrations of these markers in a sample (e.g., urine) from a subject known to have inactive LN (or inactive SLE or inflammatory or autoimmune disease subject, more generally), and then subsequently analyzing whether any changes in the levels of these markers occurs over time (e.g., over the course of days, months, years) early detection of an increase in these markers may signal the initial transitional phase of the disease from inactive to active form. This will enable clinicians to administer T cell blocking therapies (and/or other therapies, e.g., immunosuppressives) that may arrest the disease progression in its early phase of reactivation; thus, preventing full-blown transition into active disease state.

For example, when considering administering a specific CD6-ALCAM pathway inhibitor (e.g., EQ001) which is highly efficacious and has a low level of risk, few tests are needed because clinicians can accept substantial diagnostic uncertainty. On the other hand, in situations where treatment options are less effective and more risky, clinicians often need a higher degree of diagnostic certainty. Thus, a cost/benefit analysis is involved in selecting a diagnostic threshold.",

Methods of sequencing a nucleic acid sequence are well known in the art. Briefly, a sample obtained from a subject can be contacted with one or more primers which specifically hybridize to a single-strand nucleic acid sequence flanking the target gene sequence and a complementary strand is synthesized. In some next-generation technologies, an adaptor (double or single-stranded) is ligated to nucleic acid molecules in the sample and synthesis proceeds from the adaptor or adaptor compatible primers. In some related technologies, the sequence can be determined, e.g. by determining the location and pattern of the hybridization of probes, or measuring one or more characteristics of a single molecule as it passes through a sensor (e.g. the modulation of an electrical field as a nucleic acid molecule passes through a nanopore). Exemplary methods of sequencing include, but are not limited to, Sanger sequencing, dideoxy chain termination, 454 sequencing, SOLiD sequencing, polony sequencing, Illumina sequencing, Ion Torrent sequencing, sequencing by hybridization, nanopore sequencing, Helioscope sequencing, single molecule real time sequencing, RNAP sequencing, and the like. Methods and protocols for performing these sequencing methods are known in the art, see, e.g. \u201cNext Generation Genome Sequencing\u201d Ed.

RNA Sequencing. RNA-seq (RNA Sequencing), also called Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing (WTSS), is a technology that is well known in the art. It utilizes the capabilities of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to reveal a snapshot of RNA presence and quantity from a genome at a given moment in time. The transcriptome of a cell is dynamic; it continually changes as opposed to a static genome. The recent developments of next-generation sequencing allow for increased base coverage of a DNA sequence, as well as higher sample throughput. This facilitates sequencing of the RNA transcripts in a cell, providing the ability to look at alternative gene spliced transcripts, post-transcriptional changes, gene fusion, mutations/SNPs and changes in gene expression. In addition to mRNA transcripts, RNA-Seq can look at different populations of RNA to include total RNA, small RNA, such as miRNA, tRNA, and ribosomal profiling. RNA-Seq can also be used to determine exon/intron boundaries and verify or amend previously annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 gene boundaries. Prior to NGS, transcriptomics and gene expression studies were previously done with expression microarrays, which contain thousands of DNA sequences that probe for a match in the target sequence, making available a profile of all transcripts being expressed. Such microarrays may also be used to detect CD6 or ALCAM mRNA express, as may be Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), each of which technologies are well-known in the art.",

For example, freeze-thaw and alkaline lysis procedures can be useful for obtaining nucleic acid molecules from solid materials; heat and alkaline lysis procedures can be useful for obtaining nucleic acid molecules from urine: and proteinase K extraction can be used to obtain nucleic acid from blood (Roiff, A et al.

                                "Suitable thresholds may be determined in a variety of ways. For example, one recommended diagnostic threshold for the diagnosis of active LN may set a diagnostic threshold at the 97.5th percentile of the soluble CD6 and/or soluble ALCAM concentration measured in a normal population. Another method to determine a diagnostic threshold may comprise measuring serial samples from the same patient, where a prior \u201cbaseline\u201d result is used to monitor for temporal changes in a biomarker level. Population studies may also be used to select thresholds. For example, Receiver Operating Characteristic (\u201cROC\u201d) analysis is often used to select a threshold to distinguish a \u201cdiseased\u201d subpopulation from a \u201cnon-diseased\u201d subpopulation. Predictive power balances the occurrences of false positives (i.e., for example, when the person tests positive, but actually does not have the disease) and false negatives (i.e., for example, when the person tests negative, suggesting they are healthy, when they actually do have the disease). To draw a ROC curve, the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are determined as the decision threshold is varied continuously. Since TPR is equivalent with sensitivity and FPR is equal to (1\u2014specificity), the ROC graph is sometimes called the sensitivity vs (1\u2014specificity) plot. A perfect test will have an area under the ROC curve of 1.0; a random test will have an area of 0.5. A threshold value is selected to provide an acceptable level of specificity and sensitivity usually determined by summing specificity values with sensitivity values. Consequently, the larger the calculated threshold value the greater the predictive power of the specific assay measurement under analysis.",
                                "In this context, \u201cdiseased\u201d is meant to refer to a population having one characteristic (e.g., the presence of an active inflammatory or autoimmune disease or condition or the occurrence of some outcome) and \u201cnon-diseased\u201d population lacking the same characteristic (e.g., the presence of an inactive inflammatory or autoimmune disease or condition).",
                                "While a single decision threshold is the simplest application of such a method, multiple decision thresholds may be used. For example, below a first threshold, the absence of disease may be assigned with relatively high confidence, and above a second threshold the presence of disease may also be assigned with relatively high confidence. Between the two thresholds may be considered indeterminate. This is meant to be exemplary in nature only.",
                                "In addition to threshold value comparisons, other methods for correlating assay measurements to a patient classification (e.g., occurrence or nonoccurrence of disease, likelihood of an outcome, etc.) include, but are not limited to, decision trees, rule sets, Bayesian methods, and neural network methods. These methods can produce probability values representing the degree to which a subject or patient belongs to one classification out of a plurality of classifications."

                                "In certain aspects, the anti-CD6 antibody may be any antibody that binds to CD6 and blocks CD6-mediated downstream signaling in a T cell. For example, blocking studies using anti-CD6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggest that CD6 plays an important role in T cell development by regulating T cell adhesive interactions with thymic epithelial (TE) cells (Patel et al., J. Exp. Med. (1995) 181:1563-1568). Additional studies have shown that CD6 can function as an important accessory molecule in T cell activation. For example, certain anti-CD6 mAb are directly mitogenic for T cells (Gangemi et al., J. Immunol. (1989) 143:2439; Bott et al., Int. Immunol. (1993) 7:783), whereas others are able to co-stimulate T cell proliferation in conjunction with anti-CD3, anti-CD2 or PMA (Gangemi et al., J. Immunol. (1989) 143:2439; Morimoto et al., J. Immunol. (1988) 140:2165-2170; Osorio et al., Cell. Immunol. (1994) 154:23). Yet additional evidence of the role of CD6 in T cell activation comes from studies showing that CD6 becomes hyperphosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues (Swack et al., Mol. Immunol. (1989) 26:1037-1049; Swack et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1991) 266:7137; Cardenas et al., J. Immunol., 145:1450-1455 (1990)) and phosphorylated on Tyr residues (Wee et al., J. Exp. Med. (1993) 177:219-223) following T cell activation. These and other studies implicate CD6 as an important modulator of both immature and mature T cell function in vivo, affecting both T cell activation and signal transduction (De Wit, J., et al., Blood (2011) 118:6107-6114), and any antibody that is able to prevent these effects is suitable for use in the present invention.",

However, the pathogenesis of renal disease in lupus patients is not yet fully understood. The objectives of this research were to study the expression of CD6/ALCAM in kidneys of LN patients and to evaluate the potential of urine ALCAM and CD6 as biomarkers in LN disease.",

CD6 was exclusively expressed in T cells (FIG. 3A, left panel); whereas ALCAM was expressed in both professional APCs such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and tubular cells (FIG. 3A, right panel). Data from this experiment is summarized in Table 2, below.",

Both CD6+ and ALCAM+ leukocytes were found in greater numbers in the kidneys of LN patients vs. controls (FIG. 3B, \u201crenal leukocytes\u201d bar graphs on left and right panels) and ALCAM+ epithelial cells were only detectable in LN patients (FIG. 3B, \u201crenal epithelial\u201d bar graphs on left and right panels). Moreover, both CD6+ and ALCAM+ leukocytes were present in urine of LN patients (contrast to disease free patients, which are known to not have leukocytes present in their urine.

Furthermore, the number of ALCAM expressing tubular cells and macrophages were elevated in LN compared to healthy controls as well (FIG. 3D). Thus, these data suggest that LN patients have increased CD6+ T cells in the kidney due to increased T cell infiltration, and these T cells are likely activated given the increased ALCAM expression on both epithelial cells and on infiltrating renal leukocytes.",

More specifically, infiltrating T cells do indeed express CD6 and the number of CD6-expressing T cells are greater in renal biopsies from patients with LN vs. healthy controls, and in patients with proliferative vs. membranous LN. ALCAM-expressing macrophages were also numerically elevated in patients with LN, suggesting increased activation of the CD6/ALCAM signaling pathway in LN. Patients with LN also had elevated levels of ALCAM-expressing tubular cells, indicating these resident kidney cells may contribute to signaling and migration of T cells in the context of LN. Finally, urine ALCAM was significantly elevated in active LN patients in multiple ethnicities, and correlated well with clinical disease status, thus representing a promising biomarker for disease evaluation in LN, and CD6+ and ALCAM+ mRNA was detectable in leukocytes harvested from urine samples obtained from LN patients. These data strongly support that LN may be diagnosed and/or that the LN activity state and disease progression may be monitored by analyzing the presence and abundance of ALCAM or CD6 protein in urine and/or mRNA expression in urinary lymphocytes, and further suggest that a targeted CD6-ALCAM therapy, such as itolizumab, may be a promising treatment for LN."

This strain develops spontaneous systemic autoimmunity with many similarities to human SLE and LN disease and is routinely used in SLE/LN research (Richard 2018). This strain contains a mutation in the fas gene that results in loss of apoptosis and uncontrolled lymphoproliferation characterized by systemic autoimmunity, lymphadenopathy, and hyperactive T and B cells. Analogous to SLE patients, mice develop autoantibodies against nuclear antigens (anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-Ro and anti-La), deposition of immune complexes, glomerulonephritis, and additional SLE manifestations including arthritis, cerebritis, and skin rash. In this study, we assessed the expression of CD6 and ALCAM within the context of this murine model of SLE, and then subsequently targeted this signaling axis to determine its role in the pathogenesis of disease.",

MRL/lpr mice show increased levels of renal ALCAM expression, both within their tubules (FIG. 6B) and glomeruli (FIG. 6A) compared to B6 healthy control mice (shown are images representative of 3 mice per group). Additionally, macrophages infiltrating into the glomeruli of MRL/lpr mice were ALCAM+(white arrows, top panel) and were paired with a concomitant increase in CD6+ T cell infiltration (white arrows, bottom panel).",

Moreover, the frequency of kidney infiltrating immune cells and T cells at termination was reduced by anti-mCD6 treatment (FIG. 8G, FIG. 8H, and FIG. 8I); thus, demonstrating that CD6 blockade decreases the number of activated renal-infiltrating T cells.",

Isotype control mice displayed diseased skin histopathology, including hyperkeratosis (thickening of the epidermis), damage to the dermal-epidermal junction, and large cellular infiltrates into the dermis. Anti-CD6 treatment ameliorated many of these pathologies, demonstrating reduced epidermal thickening and cellular infiltrates. Anti-CD6 histology is more similar to healthy control sections from MPJ mice than to the isotype control mice. Macroscopic scoring of these lesions showed a significant improvement in the skin disease of the anti-CD6 treated mice compared to the isotype control group (FIG. 10B, p<0.05).",

There is a noticeable decrease in the number of accumulating macrophages in treated mice (FIG. 11B) compared to isotype control mice (FIG. 11A). C3 and IgG levels were similar between both treatment groups, however, and appear higher than the healthy control MPJ mice (FIG. 11C).",

Overall, these results indicate that targeting the CD6-ALCAM pathway may have promising therapeutic potential for multiple end organ pathologies within SLE."

                                "Background/Purpose: To examine the role of CD6 blockade and specific effects on the kidney, we utilized an accelerated model of nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTN). NTN is a validated, short-term model of LN. The NTN model exhibits glomerulonephritis that is mechanistically and histologically similar to that observed with LN and, consequently is commonly used as a model to test pharmacologic agents for this specific complication of SLE (Fu 2007). Animals exhibit crescentic, proliferative glomerulonephritis characterized by immune complex deposition, complement activation, and immune cell infiltration (T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages), accompanied by a decreased glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, and albuminuria, features all similar to human disease.",

Complement-mediated damage is followed by infiltration of T cells into the kidney and T cell-mediated destruction.",
                                "Two independent experiments were performed to test reproducibility and examine a wide range of endpoints in a manner standard to the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics for LN (n=6-12 per group/experiment). In Experiment 1, mice were treated with either vehicle control or a 60 \u03bcg/dose of anti-mCD6 (10D12). In Experiment 2, mice were treated with vehicle or a 60 \u03bcg/dose of either anti-mCD6 or isotype control. The treatment schedule for each of Experiments 1 and 2 is depicted in FIG. 12A. Treatment began one day before injection of the rabbit serum (Day 4) and was administered every 3 days until sacrifice (Experiment 1: Day 12; Experiment 2: Day 11); the sacrifice was set at the second day after peak proteinuria as determined by daily tracking. Both experiments included healthy (no disease-initiation) mice as controls.",
                                "Methods: Nephrotoxic serum nephritis was induced in two separate cohorts of female 129/svJ mice, both aged to 10 weeks, to model LN. Mice were immunized with rabbit IgG and CFA on day 0 to create mouse anti-rabbit antibodies, which then cross-reacted with nephrotoxic rabbit serum given on day 5, causing an antibody-mediated nephritis similar in pathology to LN. To assess the importance of the CD6/ALCAM pathway in LN pathogenesis, mice were treated on Days 4, 7, and 10 with an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (60 ug/dose, n=12/experiment), or with vehicle or isotype IgG (n=12/experiment). Healthy mice (immunized with rabbit IgG, but not given nephrotoxic serum) were also included as a control (n=12). We monitored the progress of kidney disease via proteinuria (uristix), urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to assess the effect of the anti-CD6 treatment on both cohorts. To assess the effect of treatment on immune cell infiltration, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescent staining was completed at termination.",

FIG. 12B shows histological glomerular sections of renal tissue from mice treated with vehicle control (top panel) or the CD6 antibody (bottom panel). Glomerular sections were assessed via blinded scoring by an experienced nephropathologist of endocapillary proliferation, crescent, and deposits on a scale from 0-4, and the results are graphed in FIG. 12C. Anti-CD6 treatment significantly attenuated glomerular pathology vs. vehicle control mice. Tubular scores were similarly determined by scoring tubular casts and interstitial inflammation on a scale 0-4, and the results are graphed in FIG. 12D. Like the glomerular scores, anti-mCD6 treated mice exhibited significantly improved tubular score compared to vehicle control.",
                                "Further, treatment of the NTN mice with the anti-CD6 mAb resulted in decreased levels of proteinuria (p<0.001) compared to vehicle control mice (FIG. 12E). This result was confirmed by measuring albumin:creatinine ratios in terminal urine (FIG. 12F, p<0.0001). We also found a significantly improved BUN (p<0.01) when comparing treated mice to vehicle control mice (FIG. 12G). To ensure that anti-CD6 treatment did not interfere with the induction of the NTN model, we measured mouse anti-rabbit IgG levels and rabbit anti-mouse glomerular basement membrane (GBM) levels and found no difference between the groups (data not shown).",
                                "RT-PCR for renal cytokine levels was performed to determine the effect of CD6 blockade on renal inflammation, and these experiments revealed a less inflammatory milieu of cytokines in the kidneys of treated mice as compared to control sick mice, with significantly decreased expression levels of inflammatory markers VCAM (FIG. 13A) and RANTES (FIG. 13B) and increased levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (FIG. 13C). Flow cytometry was performed on kidneys to assess the effect of anti-mCD6 treatment on immune cell infiltration. We noted an overall decrease in immune cell accumulation (FIG. 14A, CD45+) in anti-CD6 treated mice vs both isotype and vehicle control mice. Further analysis showed decreases in inflammatory myeloid cells (FIG. 14B to FIG. 14D) and in T cell populations (FIG. 14E to FIG. 14F). T cells were significantly decreased (FIG. 14E), with a significant difference noticed in activated CD4 (CD25+CD69+) cells (FIG. 14F).",

B6.Sle1yaa males develop spontaneous lupus-like autoimmune syndrome with numerous immunological aberrations. Specifically, mortality in B6.Sle1yaa males starts at \u02dc12-15 weeks of age with 50% lethality by \u02dc30-38 weeks of age. In addition, B6.Sle1yaa males exhibit severe kidney pathology characterized by hyalanized end-stage disease in most kidney glomeruli. Significant levels of auto-antibodies are detectable by 6-8 weeks, and IgG auto-antibodies against dsDNA and kidney glomerular antigens increase dramatically with onset of severe glomerulonephritis around 4-6 months. The CD4+ T cell lineage is dysregulated in B6.Sle1yaa males: early and progressive CD4+ T cell activation leads to increased IFN \u03b3-secreting cells and, eventually, to a chronic-activation induced replicative senescence.",
