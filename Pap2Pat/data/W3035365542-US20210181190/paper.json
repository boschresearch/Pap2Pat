    "title": "Antigen Discovery, Bioinformatics and Biological Characterization of Novel Immunodominant Babesia microti Antigens",
    "date": "2020-06-12",
    "abstract": "Babesia microti is an intraerythrocytic parasite and the primary causative agent of human babesiosis. It is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, transfusion of blood and blood products, organ donation, and perinatally. Despite its global public health impact, limited progress has been made to identify and characterize immunodominant B. microti antigens for diagnostic and vaccine use. Using genome-wide immunoscreening, we identified 56 B. microti antigens, including some previously uncharacterized antigens. Thirty of the most immunodominant B. microti antigens were expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli . Among these, the combined use of two novel antigens and one previously described antigen provided 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity in identifying B. microti antibody containing sera in an ELISA. Using extensive computational sequence and bioinformatics analyses and cellular localization studies, we have clarified the domain architectures, potential biological functions, and evolutionary relationships of the most immunodominant B. microti antigens. Notably, we found that the BMN-family antigens are not monophyletic as currently annotated, but rather can be categorized into two evolutionary unrelated groups of BMN proteins respectively defined by two structurally distinct classes of extracellular domains. Our studies have enhanced the repertoire of immunodominant B. microti antigens, and assigned potential biological function to these antigens, which can be evaluated to develop novel assays and candidate vaccines.",

                "Babesia microti, an intraerythrocytic parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, is the primary causative agent of human babesiosis1. It is transmitted by Ixodes ticks but also can be transmitted by transfusion of blood, blood products, solid organ donation, and perinatal transmission2\u20137. Human B. microti infection occurs worldwide but is most commonly reported in the United States and is endemic in the Northeast and upper Midwest1. The number of tick-borne and transfusion-transmitted cases of babesiosis in the United States has risen dramatically in the past two decades5,8. New cases of babesiosis have been reported throughout the world, including a new Babesia endemic area in Northeast China due to Babesia venatorum9. Asymptomatic B. microti infection is not uncommon in healthy residents of B. microti-endemic regions and among blood donors. On Block Island, Rhode Island, about a fifth of healthy adults infected with B. microti are asymptomatic10. In a comprehensive study in 60,512 healthy blood donors in endemic areas in northeastern United States, 0.38% of the donors were shown to carry B. microti DNA or B. microti antibody in their bloodstream11. Asymptomatically infected individuals may transmit the infection through the blood supply if they donate blood. Death occurs in about a fifth of individuals receiving contaminated blood transfusion5. Similar fatality rates have been reported in asplenic patients and in patients suffering from cancer with or without asplenia and/or rituximab therapy. The latter group of patients often require hospital admission and experience persistent relapsing disease that may last for more than a year11\u201313. Fatality estimates for B. microti infection have ranged from <1% to 2% in the general population and 3% to 9% in hospitalized babesiosis patients14\u201319. Fatality rates among asplenic European patients with Babesia divergens infection have reached as high as 42% but more recently have decreased as a result of improved adjunctive therapy19\u201321.",
                "Although the full genome sequence for B. microti was published in 201222,23, there is still a scarcity of well-characterized, immunodominant B. microti antigens for use in diagnostic assays and vaccine development. Antibody testing using the Indirect Fluorescence Antibody assay (IFA) has been used in conjunction with B. microti PCR as an effective blood donor screening approach to prevent transfusion transmitted babesiosis11,24. Earlier efforts using cDNA expression libraries have led to the identification of novel B. microti immunodominant antigens which have proven useful as diagnostic markers for infection25\u201327. The availability of full genome sequence for B. microti22,23 allows the genome-wide screening to identify novel immunodominant B. microti antigens and to perform genetic and biological characterization of these antigens. Such investigations may not only contribute to the development of superior diagnostic assays but also provide a better understanding of Babesia pathogenesis and phylogenetic relationships among different Babesia species/strains.",
                "In this work, we generated B. microti cDNA phage display libraries to identify a battery of novel immuno-dominant B. microti antigens, searched for structural features that could predict their biological function and cellular localization, and corrected the annotation and phylogenetic classification of some previously discovered antigens. Additionally, we have evaluated the use of these antigens (BmSERA1, BmMCFRP1 and BmPi\u03b2S1) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent B. microti antibody assay (BmELISA). Our study significantly expands the pool of well-characterized B. microti antigens as potential diagnostic biomarkers and vaccine candidates and demonstrates their utility as screening targets in a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic antibody assay."

                        "To conduct a genome-wide search for immunodominant B. microti antigens, a cDNA library in the phage expression system was constructed to potentially represent the complete proteome expressed during the asexual blood stage of parasites isolated from infected DBA/2 mice. The foreign protein is incorporated into the virion as gIIIp fusion, which retains infectivity and displays the foreign peptide in an immunologically accessible form. The average size of the cDNA fragments fused to the gIII gene (M13 phage gene encoding gIIIp surface protein) was 400\u2009bp (small fragments: 50\u2013300\u2009bp and large fragments: 300\u20131000\u2009bp). Following characterization, we obtained a library size of more than 106 fusion phages, each displaying a B. microti peptide. Given the B. microti genome size of ~ 6.5 Mbp and 70% of the genes interrupted by short introns of 20\u201325\u2009bp, this library should theoretically represent 100% coverage of the entire open reading frame of B. microti. The M13 phage display library expressing the B. microti transcriptome was screened with a pool of seven sera obtained from babesiosis patients. Serum samples were obtained from patients between 1 and 9 weeks after the onset of symptoms, but in most cases one to three weeks after the onset of symptoms. Following two rounds of panning, a total of 960 clones were isolated and amplified via PCR, before being subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The gene sequences thus obtained were aligned to the B. microti genome (www.piroplasmadb.org) which led to identification of 56 B. microti antigens that were recognized by antibodies generated against these antigens. Of the 56 proteins, 11 were predicted to be secreted or cell-surface proteins. The annotations, protein domain(s) and the phyletic patterns of these antigens where relevant are presented in Table\u00a01.Table 1Analysis of Babesia microti antigenic proteins.GeneID*AccessionCurated Domain ArchitectureFunctionCommentsBmR1_03g00785XP_012648767.1SIG\u2009+\u2009BAHCS1adhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_04g08155XP_012650223.1SIG\u2009+\u2009Bm-SERA1adhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_02g04285XP_012648612.1SIG\u2009+\u2009BmMCFRP1 /MN15/BMN1\u201315 Maltese cross form related proteinadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_03g04855XP_012649578.1SIG\u2009+\u2009Pi\u03b2S1 domainadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_03g00690XP_012648749.1SIG\u2009+\u2009EGF\u2009+\u2009EGF\u2009+\u2009EGF\u2009+\u2009EGFadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_01g03455XP_012647758.1AP2 DNA-binding domainTranscriptionAP2BmR1_02g00670XP_012647909.2TP\u2009+\u2009peptidylprolyl isomerasePlastid protein folding proteinpeptidylprolyl isomerase with a transit peptideBmR1_03g03490XP_012649309.1sGTPaseTranslationelongation factor EF-1 alpha subunitBmR1_04g06300XP_012649865.1SIGadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_01g01121XP_012647300.2Apicomplexa specific domain (173\u2013231)MiscellaneousApicomplexan+VitrellaBmR1_04g08775XP_012650340.1HSP90ChaperoneHSP90BmR1_02g02760XP_012648315.1NTN-HYDROLASEprotein degradation20\u2009S proteasomal Peptidase subunitBmR1_03g00420XP_012648695.1Histone FoldChromatinhistone H2ABmR1_01g01620XP_012647389.1PPR repeatsRNA binding and processingBmR1_04g09905XP_012650554.2alpha-helical proteinMiscellaneousApicomplexan+Vitrella-specificBmR1_02g02985XP_012648359.1BLBD (Biotin Lipid Binding domain)+E3_binding+dehydrogenaseMetabolismBmR1_02g03700XP_012648499.1AcetyltransferaseChromatinHistone acetyltransferase 1BmR1_04g07910XP_012650176.1ubiquitin+UBAUbiquitinBmR1_02g03965XP_012648551.1RNA-HelicaseRNA binding and processingRNA-HelicaseBmR1_03g00020XP_012648615.2SIG\u2009+\u2009Pi\u00dfS domainadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_04g07535XP_012650105.1SIG\u2009+\u2009BmMCFRP /MN15/BMN1\u201315 Maltese cross form related proteinadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_02g00205XP_012647816.1SIGadhesion/Cell surface/exported proteinBmR1_01g01845XP_012647436.1HAD phosphataseMiscellaneousOrtholog of Plasmodium HAD domain ookinete proteinBmR1_03g04120XP_012649435.1No HitMiscellaneousBmR1_02g02345XP_012648236.1Pfimp2MiscellaneousOrtholog of Plasmodium Pfimp2 inner membrane proteinsBmR1_03g02795XP_012649170.1Babesia/Theileria specific domainMiscellaneousBmR1_03g02390XP_012649089.1ActinCytoskeletonActinBmR1_04g05965XP_012649799.1Enolase_N\u2009+\u2009Enolase_CMetabolismEnolaseBmR1_02g01625XP_012648094.1GDI (Rossmann fold)SignalingRab GDP dissociation inhibitor betaBmR1_04g08040XP_012650201.1HSP70ChaperoneHsp70BmR1_04g06288XP_012649864.1NudixMetabolismNucleotide NDP-X processingBmR1_01g02215XP_012647511.1Pep3/Vps18/deep orange familyGolgi/Vacuolar sortingBmR1_01g02270XP_012647522.1No HitMiscellaneousBmR1_03g03070XP_012649225.1Ribosomal_L27ARibosomal Proteinlarge subunit ribosomal protein L27AeBmR1_03g02570XP_012649124.1SF-assemblinCytoskeletonSF-assemblin/beta giardinBmR1_03g04301XP_012649471.1UFD1UbiquitinUbiquitin fusion degradation protein UFD1BmR1_02g00430XP_012647861.1Utp11RNA binding and processingUTP11 U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 11BmR1_03g02185XP_012649047.1BBOXUbiquitinBmR1_03g03720XP_012649355.1Myosin-ATPase+BZIP\u2009+\u2009BetaPropellerCytoskeletonBmR1_02g02765XP_012648316.1Zn-binding domainMiscellaneousBmR1_04g07165XP_012650036.1MIT\u2009+\u2009AAA\u2009+\u2009Vps4_CCytoskeletonBmR1_01g03115XP_012647688.1cNMP_binding+cNMP_bindingSignalingBmR1_03g02831XP_012649178.2Protein kinaseSignalingBmR1_01g02860XP_012647635.1DDRP-betaDNA replication/processingDNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit BBmR1_03g02705XP_012649152.1N-OB\u2009+\u2009wHTHDNA replication/processingReplication A32BmR1_03g02396XP_012649091.1IWS1ChromatinBmR1_03g01440XP_012648898.1RNA-HelicaseRNA binding and processinginactive RNA helicaseBmR1_04g05525XP_012649711.1Peptidase_M24\u2009+\u2009METPEPTIDASE-HTHMiscellaneousMetallopeptidaseBmR1_01g01485XP_012647367.1RNA-HelicaseRNA binding and processingRNA-HelicaseBmR1_03g00861XP_012648784.1sGTPaseSignalingBmR1_02g02755XP_012648314.1sGTPaseSignalingBmR1_01g01670XP_012647399.1SIG\u2009+\u2009Thioredoxin+Thioredoxin_6+ThioredoxinSurface/exported proteinER lumen disulfide bond isomeraseBmR1_03g02230XP_012649056.1GOLDGolgi/Vacuolar sortingBmR1_04g09097XP_012650403.1Sec. 61_betasecretionBmR1_02g03525XP_012648466.1TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TM\u2009+\u2009TMSurface/exported proteinBmR1_04g09955XP_012650565.1Cpn60_TCP1Chaperone*Genes are listed based on their high, medium and low immunogenic ranking shown in Fig.\u00a02."

To assess the possible use of the 30 B. microti antigens as diagnostic biomarkers, their cDNAs were cloned with a hexa-histidine tag at the N-terminus and were expressed in E. coli.",

The recombinantly expressed proteins were purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography (data not shown). The availability of whole genome sequence of B. microti22 has made feasible in silico analyses of these identified immunodominant antigens. We find that the 30 most immunodominant antigens identified from the phage library immunoscreening do not show any preferential clustering and are distributed across all four chromosomes of B. microti. This indicates that the antigens identified are not preferentially drawn from the proteins encoded by the highly variable sub-telomeric regions22,23.",
                        "We also analyzed the genetic variability in the 30 most immunoreactive antigens by determining the non-synonymous (dN)/synonymous (dS) substitutions in relation to the recently published 41 B. microti genome sequences28. The dN/dS ratio quantifies selection pressure acting on a protein coding region. A dN/dS ratio of more than one indicates that the protein is under immune pressure and leads to changes in amino acids. In our dataset, 11 out of 30 B. microti proteins have dN/dS ratio of >1 suggesting selective pressure on immunodominant proteins for divergence (Fig.\u00a01). More than half of the most immunoreactive proteins (18/30) have a dN/dS ratio of <1 suggesting a conserved nature of this subset of antigens. One of these 30 proteins has a dN/dS ratio of exactly one, raising the possibility that this gene might be under relaxed selection.Figure 1Heat map showing replicates of phages displaying 56 B. microti protein sequences as gIIIp fusion isolated following immunoscreening.

Of the 56 proteins, the seven proteins with highest immunoreactivity which is defined as having the highest percentage of positives over the signal/cut-off value above 1 (Fig.\u00a02), six are predicted to be secreted based on sequence analysis. This suggests that our screen was successful in identifying proteins that are most likely to provoke an antibody response by virtue of being extracellularly exposed to the host immune cells. Of these 11 secreted or surface proteins five are members of protein families that have been reported as antigenic in other strains of B. microti or other Babesia species. Through a comprehensive sequence searches against the complete panel of publicly available eukaryotic genome sequences in the Genbank database we observed that a total of 11 of the immunoreactive proteins recovered in our screen showed a phyletic pattern restricted uniquely to piroplasmida or more broadly to apicomplexa and related alveolates. These include some of the proteins with highest immunoreactivity suggesting that they are likely to serve as specific diagnostic markers with no risk of cross reactivity with conserved proteins from other organisms. These findings do not discount the presence of intracellular B. microti antigens that are capable of eliciting an effective protective response when presented to host immune cells."

                                "Some of the most immunodominant proteins identified in the B. microti Peabody strain were cell surface proteins (BmR1_03g00690 [BmEGF1], BmR1_02g04285 [BmMCFRP1], BmR1_04g08155 [BmSERA1], BmR1_03g04855 [BmPi\u03b2S1], BmR1_03g00785 [BmBAHCS1], and BmR1_04g06300) except BmR1_01g03455 which was found to be an AP2-superfamily transcription factor typical of apicomplexa. Five of these proteins namely, BmR1_03g00690, BmR1_02g04285, BmR1_04g08155, BmR1_03g04855, and BmR1_03g00785 were subjected to an in-depth sequence analysis to obtain a better understanding of their evolutionary history and potential functional features.\u00a0BmR1_03g00690 was found to contain four copies of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains (Fig.\u00a03). Accordingly, we named it BmEGF1. EGF domains have been found in wide range of cytoadherence proteins from a variety of microbes in apicomplexa, such as MSP1, MSP4, MSP5, MSP8 and MSP10, which are merozoite surface proteins of Plasmodium falciparum30. The presence of EGF domains in BmR1_03g00690 was not previously known and this protein is unrelated to any EGF domain proteins from other Apicomplexa parasites, including other piroplasms. The EGF domains in this protein show certain features related to the pattern of conserved cysteines that are shared with specific EGF domains found in certain Giardia intestinalis and animal secreted proteins (Fig.\u00a03). This suggests that this EGF domain protein is a unique surface protein of B. microti, which might have been acquired relatively recently, either from an animal source or from some other parasitic eukaryote.Figure 3Multiple Alignment of (A) BAHCS family (B) Pi\u03b2S family (C) EGF domain containing BmR1_03g00690 family.

                                "The gene of a second immunodominant protein, BmR1_02g04285 (BmMCFRP1), is currently improperly predicted, where a 5\u2032 exon containing the signal peptide has been omitted (Genbank ID: XP_021338378.1). This protein contains a conserved domain that is also found in two copies in the paralogous protein BMR1_04g07535 from B. microti. These two proteins in turn are homologous of the Maltese cross form-related antigen (N1\u201315/BMN1\u201315 protein; Genbank ID: BAC07532.1) that was identified in two distinct isolates (the B. microti Munich and MN1 strains; Table\u00a03). They are thought to provide protection against B. microti infection in mice, although immunization with a control baculovirus with no B. microti antigen also induced some level of immunity31,32. Interestingly, there is extensive sequence divergence between the published Maltese cross form-related antigens from the Munich and MN1 strains and the cognate in the deposited B. microti R1 genome, suggesting that this protein and its paralogs might be polymorphic in B. microti.Table 3Selected families of Babesia microti surface proteins.FamilyProteins from other strainsBabesia microti strain RI GeneIDsCommentsBAHCS domain familyB. microti MN1 strainBmR1_01g00004Bmn1\u20134 and Br-1 have both Pi\u03b2S and BAHCS domainsBMN1\u20132BmR1_01g03535BMN1\u20133BmR1_02g00005BMN1\u20136BmR1_02g04260BMN1\u20137BmR1_02g04275BMN1\u20139BmR1_03g00785BMN1\u201313BmR1_03g04850BMN1\u20134BmR1_04g09975MN-10BmR1_03g00785N1\u201321 theB. microti Gray strain: BmSA1B. microti Munich strain: BmP32B. rodhaini Australia strain: MSA1 and MSA2B. rodhaini Japan strain: Br-1, p25, and p26Pi\u03b2S domain familyB. microti MN1 strainBmR1_04g09980Divergent version in TheileriaBMN1\u201310BmR1_04g09760Bmn1\u20134 and Br-1 has both Pi\u03b2S and BAHCS domainsN1\u201310BmR1_03g04855BMN1\u20134BmR1_03g04840BMN1\u20133BBmR1_03g00255BMN1\u20138BmR1_03g00020BMN1\u201311.BmR1_02g04280B. microti Gray strainBmR1_02g04270IRA protein;BmR1_02g04265B. rodhaini Japan strainBmR1_02g00010Br-1 and Br-2BmR1_01g03513EGF domain familyBmR1_03g00690 (BMNEGF1)Contains distinct version of EGF domainBMNSERA familyBmR1_04g08155 (BMNSERA)BMN1\u201317/20familyB. microti MN1 strainBMN1\u201317BMN1\u201320B. microti Gray strain: 17NBmR1_01g03280 (BMN1\u201320)MCFRP domain familyB. microti Munich: MN1\u201315B. microti MN1 strain: BMN1\u201315BmR1_02g04285 (BmMCFRP1) The BmMCFRP1 gene is improperly predicted.

                                "A third immunodominant B. microti cell surface protein BmR1_04g08155 (BmSERA1) is a 946-amino acid protein, which was erroneously annotated as having \u201chomologies with serine-repeat antigen 4\u201d. This annotation is unsupported by sequence analysis and arises from improper masking of low complexity sequence. This protein has a previously described homolog in the Munich strain of B. microti named BmP94 and was reported to have antigenic properties consistent with those identified in the current study33. Remarkably, comparison of BmR1_04g08155 with this homolog protein suggests that BmR1_04g08155 is extremely fast-evolving even between these two strains, with a sequence identity of about 43%. This is much higher than the sequence divergence for other available proteins of these two strains (~95\u201398% identity). This divergence could be due to selection exerted by differences in the erythrocytes of potentially distinct reservoir hosts of the two strains. Alternatively, these findings might indicate that the divergence is an evolutionary response to variable immune pressure of different hosts, consistent with its character as an antigenic secreted/cell surface protein."

                                "The other two highly immunodominant proteins, BmR1_03g04855 and BmR1_03g00785 are members of the so called \u201cBMN\u201d class of antigenic proteins, which are shared by different B. microti strains and B. rodhaini. Some of these antigens (SA5\u20131\u20131, SA26 and SA17) were first identified in B. rodhaini in 198834 and several subsequent studies in B. microti have identified them as antigenic proteins26,31. These studies have not fully defined the evolutionary relationships of these proteins, however, resulting in incomplete understanding of their nomenclature as reported in the literature26,31,35,36. Our analysis of these proteins helps to further clarify their evolutionary relationships (BmR1_03g04855 and BmR1_03g00785). Our sequence analysis shows that the proteins which have been considered BMN antigens do not constitute a monophyletic group and should not be classified as belonging to a unified \u201cBMN family\u201d because all members currently annotated as BMN proteins are not monophyletic. Instead our analysis shows that the majority can be classified into two largely evolutionarily unrelated groups of BMN proteins. The first of these groups includes the previously characterized BMN1\u201310, N1\u201310, BMN1\u20134, BMN1\u20133B, BMN1\u20138, and BMN1\u201311 proteins from the B. microti MN1 strain, the IRA protein from the B. microti Gray strain and the Br-1 and Br-2 proteins from the B. rodhaini Japan strain. The second major group is comprised of BMN1\u20132, BMN1\u20133, BMN1\u20136, BMN1\u20137, BMN1\u20139, BMN1\u201313, BMN1\u20134, MN-10, N1\u201321 from the B. microti MN1 strain, BmSA1 from the B. microti Gray strain, BmP32 from the B. microti Munich strain, MSA1 and MSA2 from B. rodhaini Australia strain and Br-1, p25, and p26 from the B. rodhaini Japan strain. The equivalent versions of these two groups from the B. microti R1 strain are provided in Table\u00a03. Beyond these, the proteins BMN1\u201317 and BMN1\u201320 are paralogous proteins that are unrelated to any of the above groups. Likewise, the Maltese cross form-related antigen (BMN1\u201315/N1\u201315) and BmR1_02g04285 (BmMCFRP1) define a distinct family unrelated to the other BMN1 antigens (see above). Therefore, we recommend that the BMN antigens be treated as distinct groups as per their conserved domains and evolutionary relationships described here (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a03).Figure 4Phylogenetic tree of the (A) BAHCS family (B) BmPi\u03b2S1, and other families of proteins. Strain specific clades are shown with colored branches and boxes.

The proteins are denoted by their gene names or gene ids, species names, and accession numbers.",
                                "Our analysis shows that BmR1_03g04855 from the B. microti R1 strain belongs to the first of the major BMN groups (i.e. BMN1\u201310 and its relatives). B. microti R1 has a total of 10 members of this group (Table\u00a03). These correspond in large part to the B. microti proteins termed BMN1 in the work by Silva et al.37. Analysis of these proteins shows that they are characterized by the presence of a conserved domain which might be present in one to five copies per protein, with a single copy in BmR1_03g04855. Secondary-structure-prediction based on the alignment of this domain showed that it contains an N-terminal region with 8 conserved \u03b2-strands followed by a C-terminal region with multiple cysteines. The N-terminal region is likely to adopt a \u03b2-sandwich fold, whereas the C-terminal region is likely to adopt a disulfide bond-supported structure. Interestingly, iterative sequence profile analysis identified proteins with a divergent version of this domain outside of Babesia in a group of secreted proteins in Theileria. While this family is expanded across Theileria, it is particularly abundant in the horse-parasitic species T. equi (~460 members); however, it is present in fewer numbers in T. annulata, T. orientalis, and T. parva. Because it is present in both the piroplasms, we accordingly named this domain the piroplasm \u03b2-strand (Pi\u03b2S) domain (Fig.\u00a03, Supplementary Fig.\u00a0S4). Accordingly, we named BmR1_03g04855 as BmPi\u03b2S1. Given that the Pi\u03b2S family is inferred to have been ancestrally present in the piroplasms, it is likely that it has played a key role in host-parasite dynamics of the entire piroplasm lineage. Importantly, our phylogenetic analysis of the Pi\u03b2S domain in the genus Babesia shows that its evolution is dominated by lineage-specific expansions (Fig.\u00a04). Notably, the versions in B. rodhaini appear to have radiated entirely independently of those from B. microti. Moreover, even within B. microti we found clades exclusively or predominantly containing R1 strain or MN1 strain proteins (Fig.\u00a04).",
                                "Our analysis shows that BmR1_03g00785 from our screen belongs to the second major BMN group (prototyped by BMN1\u20132, BMN1\u20139 etc.). These correspond in large part to the B. microti proteins termed BMN2 in the work by Silva et al.37. We find that this group is characterized by a distinctive \u03b1-helical domain with 9 \u03b1-helices. Further, these proteins terminate at the C-terminus in a hydrophobic GPI-anchor sequence. This suggests that all these proteins are anchored to the cell membrane with \u03b1-helical domain lying proximal to the membrane. This domain is thus far found only in the genus Babesia. Nine proteins containing this domain are present in the B. microti R1 strain. Accordingly, we named this protein as Babesia \u03b1-helical cell surface (BAHCS) domain. Unlike the Pi\u03b2S domain, the BAHCS domain is always found in a single copy in a protein. Thus, we named BmR1_03g00785 as BmBAHCS1. In a single protein, Br-1 from B. rodhaini and its cognate BMN1\u20134 from the B. microti MN1 strain, it is combined with an N-terminal Pi\u03b2S domain in the same protein. Notably, phylogenetic analysis of the BAHCS domain shows a similar evolutionary trend as the Pi\u03b2S domain, with independent expansions in B. rodhaini and B. microti followed by notable inter-strain radiations in the later species (Fig.\u00a04).",
                                "In summary, our analyses suggest that the immunodominant cell surface antigens that we identified have been evolving rapidly in phylogenetically closely related organisms through independent lineage-specific expansions. Such a pattern is the hallmark of an arms race with the host and has been observed before in the case of other apicomplexan surface proteins such as the rifin-like38 and the var/DBL1 superfamilies in Plasmodium falciparum, and the vir/yir superfamilies in P. vivax/P. yoelii30. This suggests that the Pi\u03b2S and BAHCS domain families are likely to be expressed on the cell-surface at the interface with host immune cells. The dynamic evolution suggests that the lineage-specific expansions are a positively selected response against the host immunity targeting them."

We used immunofluorescence microscopy and polyclonal antibodies generated in mice against the respective recombinant proteins. Anti-BmSERA1 antibody showed expression of BmSERA1 on the surface of the late stage merozoite which is a tetrad structure (Fig.\u00a05A), suggesting a possible role of this protein in invasion of B. microti parasites into fresh RBCs after their release from infected RBCs. The distribution of BmMCFRP1 when captured using anti-BmMCFRP1 polyclonal antibody, indicate expression on a free merozoite and on a parasite that is in the process of invading an RBC. Interestingly, we also noted a distinct scattered and punctate pattern of expression on the surface of infected RBCs. At the same time these speckled patterns are also detected in the adjacent uninfected RBCs (Fig.\u00a05B), suggesting a possible dual function as a membrane bound and as a secreted protein that binds uninfected RBCs. The immunofluorescence signal obtained with anti-BmPi\u03b2S1 antibody shows high level expression on the surface of infected RBCs harboring tetrad form parasites and as a diffuse punctate pattern which appears to be inside the RBC cytoplasm (Fig.\u00a05A), suggesting a role as a transported protein which is anchored in the infected RBC membrane. No non-specific reactivity was observed using antibodies against the CFA/IFA adjuvant alone formulation.Figure 5(A) The fluorescent image shows localization of BmSERA1, BmMCFRP1 and BmPi\u03b2S1 in B. microti infected mouse red blood cells (see results). Green channel (Alexa 488) images correspond to the location of B. microti parasite proteins. Red channel images are cell membrane stained by PKH26 and Blue channel shows DAPI stained nuclei. Merged images contain the overlay of green, red and blue channels. As observed, sera from mice immunized with Freund\u2019s adjuvant only (negative control) shows DAPI stained nuclei demonstrating B. microti infected RBCs without a traceable green signal, confirming specificity of the assay. Sera collected from mice immunized with BmSERA1, BmMCFRP1 and BmPi\u03b2S1 in Freund\u2019s Complete Adjuvant show specific localization of the B. microti proteins as membrane bound on the parasite surface (anti-BmSERA1) or on the surface of infected RBCs (anti-BmMCFRP1 and anti-BmPi\u03b2S1).

To accomplish this, we aligned the nucleotide sequences coding for the respective antigens with the sequences from the 41 B. microti isolates available in the Piroplasmadb.org. The full length BmSERA1, BmPi\u03b2S1 and BmMCFRP1 have a total of 72 (2841 nucleotides), 11 (816 nucleotides) and 20 (531 nucleotides) non-synonymous substitutions showing 2.5%, 1.3% and 3.7% chance of substitution, respectively. The nucleotide variation reported here as non-synonymous substitutions are mostly derived from the B. microti Russia-1995 strain, which is more variable at the genomic level than the strains from the continental United States28. When analysis for nucleotide polymorphism was limited to the continental United States isolates, the extent of non-synonymous substitutions was reduced to 23 (2841 nucleotides), 0 (816 nucleotides) and 0 (531 nucleotides) showing 0.8%, 0% and 0% chance of substitution, respectively for BmSERA1, BmPi\u03b2S1 and BmMCFRP1.

                "We utilized a phage display library encoding fragments of the B. microti transcriptome to identify antigenic proteins that were recognized by antibodies generated after natural infection in humans. We have identified 56 B. microti antigens using two cycles of affinity panning, that exhibited strong reactivity with anti-B. microti antibodies in patients living in a highly endemic area in the northeastern United States. We produced 30 recombinantly expressed immunoreactive B. microti antigens and, based on immunodominance, 19 of these were extensively screened in ELISA. Three of the most immunodominant of these antigens - BmSERA1, BmMCFRP1 and BmPi\u03b2S1 were selected for sensitivity and specificity studies in Bm-ELISA. They exhibited 86%, 82% and 79% reactivity, respectively when probed against sera from babesiosis patients. A combination of 3 antigens gave an improved sensitivity of 96% (27/28) (Table\u00a02). Notably, in earlier studies, the BmBAHCS1 (BmR1_03g00785; named BMN1\u20139 by Lodes et al.26, BmSA1 by Luo et al.29, and BmGPI12 by Cornillot et al.36) allowed the detection of 100% of babesiosis serum samples tested, demonstrating the diagnostic value of this antigen. Our results clearly indicate that the discovery of these novel antigens has enhanced the repertoire\u00a0 of immunodominant B. microti molecules that could be explored to develop highly sensitive and specific B. microti antibody and antigen capture assays for diagnosis of acute babesiosis, blood donor screening, and support of vaccine development. Availability of these antigens also paves the way to develop multiantigen-based B. microti detection assays that would offset the potential sensitivity loss due to geographical antigenic polymorphism and antigenic drift over time.",
                "Analyses of the 30 most\u00a0 highly immunoreactive B. microti antigens revealed that the genes encoding these proteins are distributed throughout the four B. microti chromosomes, suggesting a lack of clustering of genes coding for immuno-dominant antigens to a specific genomic locus. Of the 30 antigens, 11 may be subjected to immune pressure, defined by the dN/dS ratio >1 (Fig.\u00a01). Furthermore, minimal or no genetic diversity was observed in the three most immunodominant antigens - BmSERA1, BmMCFRP1 and BmPi\u03b2S1 when sequence analyses were performed with 38 B. microti isolates from the continental United States28. These results indicate a high degree of genetic stability in B. microti strains circulating in the United States. They are consistent with an earlier report that B. microti strains in the continental United States represent minimal diversity as a geographical group, but largely differ from the published Russian strain28. The possible reasons for limited genetic diversity among B. microti isolates may include limited host specificity\u00a0in invasion and survival\u00a0 in red blood cells and a lack of recombination events during the sexual cycle in tick-vectors.",
                "Further sequence and bioinformatics analyses of the five most immunodominant B. microti antigens - BmEGF1, BmMCFRP1, BmSERA1, BmPi\u03b2S1 and BmBAHCS1 has better revealed their domain structure, evolutionary relationships, and putative biological functions. Our sequence analysis led to a correction in annotaion of the BmSERA1 gene which was erroneously classified as homologous with serine-repeat antigen 4. A notable contribution of this study is the finding that the major group of the BMN family antigens are not monophyletic as currently annotated, but rather can be classified into two evolutionary unrelated groups of BMN proteins (see the results section). Based on our analyses, we strongly recommend that henceforth the BMN antigens be treated as distinct groups per their conserved domains and evolutionary relationships (Fig.\u00a04, Table\u00a03).",
                "The localization studies by immunofluorescence microscopy further confirmed the findings of the bioinformatics analyses. The localization study revealed that BmSERA1 and BmMCFRP1 are surface exposed and secreted antigens, respectively, making them a potential immune target (Table\u00a01). Further, BmSERA1 is distributed in a pattern that is similar to that observed in the merozoite surface protein (MSP) family in malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum39 and Plasmodium vivax40. MSPs in Plasmodium parasite have been shown to be required for the initial attachment of merozoites to RBCs for invasion. It is therefore possible that BmSERA1 may play a role in the invasion process. Given its expression pattern, BmMCFRP1 may be associated with trafficking of proteins to the surface or involved in organelle or membrane formation, as seen in Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites. In P. falciparum, binding of erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) has been shown to prime the erythrocyte surface by altering the biophysical nature of target cell and, thereby reduces the energy barrier to invasion41. Thus, it is feasible that binding of BmMCFRP1 to an uninfected RBC functions in a similar fashion as P. falciparum EBA-175 that may serve as a gateway to invasion and new infection. Interestingly, the bright continuous fluorescent signal of BmPi\u03b2S1 is comparable to that of Plasmodium proteins, including knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP), ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA), and the subtelomeric variant open reading frame protein (STEVOR)42\u201345.",
                "In summary, our unbiased genome-wide screening for immuno-dominant B. microti antigens has led to the discovery of 56 novel antigens that are attractive diagnostic and vaccine targets. These antigens are available for evaluation\u00a0 to develop higher sensitivity\u00a0 antigen/antibody based detection assays and as vaccine candidates in experimental models of B. microti. Finally, our bioinformatics analyses and immunofluorescence studies allowed us to better define the structural\u00a0 features and evlolutionary relationships and a finer classification of the B. microti BMN family antigens and assign potential biological functions to the most immunodominant B. microti antigens."

B. microti RNA was prepared using TriZol reagent (Life Technologies, NY), followed by chloroform extraction and precipitation that was performed with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol. Complimentary DNA (cDNA) encompassing the open reading frames was prepared from the B. microti RNA using the SMART\u00ae cDNA library construction kit (Clontech laboratories Inc., CA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, the first strand cDNA was synthesized from the B. microti RNA using a modified oligo (dT) primer and SMART IV oligo primers. The second-strand cDNA was made using Long Distance (LD) PCR conditions. The double stranded cDNA (~10\u2009\u00b5g) product was subjected to controlled fragmentation using sonication (Sonic Dismembrator; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) to generate small (50\u2013300\u2009bp) and large (300\u20131000\u2009bp) cDNA library fragments which were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. These cDNA fragments were dephosphorylated and polished to obtain blunt ended fragments to be ligated into Sma I (CCC^GGG) digested M13-derived phage vector. The ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli TG1 cells (Agilent technologies, MD) and selected for recombinants (tetr) on tetracycline plates. Transformed cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 250\u2009rpm in 100\u2009ml of 2XYT broth containing 5\u2009\u00b5g/ml tetracycline for ~16\u2009h. The recombinant lysogenic phages displaying fusion protein domains were recovered from the supernatant and the phage titer was determined. The cDNA inserts were expressed as NH2-terminal fusion to the gIIIp surface protein of the M13 phage. Both small (50\u2013300\u2009bp) and large fragment (300\u20131000\u2009bp) B. microti libraries yielded 106 independent clones, as established by limiting dilution of the transformed bacterial cells. Forty-eight clones were randomly picked from each library; PCR amplified using phage specific primers; and sequenced to determine the random distribution and diversity of the B. microti genome libraries."

To minimize non-specific reactivity, pooled babesiosis sera were incubated on ultraviolet-killed M13K07 phage-coated petri dishes. For the affinity panning of the phage library, 96-well microwell plates (Immulon 4 HBX; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with 1\u2009\u00b5g per well of goat anti-human IgG Fc\u03b3 antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10\u2009mM Na2HPO4, 1.8\u2009mM KH2PO4, 2.7\u2009mM KCl, 137\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.4). After three washings with PBST (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.1% Tween 20 [Sigma-Aldrich, MO]), 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) in PBST was added to the wells to block the unoccupied reactive sites. The preadsorbed babesiosis patient sera from the earlier step was added to the wells and incubated for 1\u2009h at room temperature (RT). Wells were washed three times with PBST, and 108 phages from the B. microti library were added for 1\u2009h at RT. Non-adherent phages were removed by nine washes with PBST followed by three washes with PBS. The adherent phages were eluted by the addition of 0.1\u2009N Glycine.HCl (pH 2.2), 100\u2009\u00b5l per well for 10\u2009min at 37 \u00b0C.

The eluate was simultaneously titrated and amplified for the next round of panning in log phase (OD600nm ~0.8) E. coli TG1 cells. For the phage amplification, the phage infected TG1 cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 90\u2009min without shaking followed by dilution with 10\u2009ml of 2XYT medium containing 5\u2009\u00b5g/ml tetracycline and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, with shaking at 250\u2009rpm for ~16\u2009h. Phage supernatants were collected after centrifugation and one more round of panning was carried out. Phage titration plates were used for harvesting/selecting the colonies and performing PCR amplification with subsequent sequencing to establish the identity of the cloned insert. A total of 960 phage clones were sequenced using phage specific primers. The sequences obtained after Sanger\u2019s di-deoxy sequencing (performed at the FDA center facility) were analyzed by the NCBI BLAST to identify the B. microti protein that each encodes. Finally, the sequencing reads were aligned to the target sequence in the MacVector program."
