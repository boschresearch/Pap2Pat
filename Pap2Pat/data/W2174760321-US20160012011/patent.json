                        "Multichannel measurements have greatly increased understanding of complex systems in various fields of knowledge, such as astronomy, geological physics etc., and are producing large fundamental and applied impacts. Registration of the dynamic signals by spatially distributed sensors is aimed on the functional reconstruction of the system under study. Analysis of the registered data must allow estimating spatial structures and time behavior of the objects composing the system. There are many important applications of multichannel measurements in biology and medicine, such as electric cardiography, magnetic cardiography, vectorcardiography, electric encephalography etc. Another example is magnetic encephalography (MEG) that allows the study of brain activity.",
                        "MEG records magnetic fields that are produced by electrical currents occurring in the brain, using numerous external magnetometers. There are various advantages of using MEG, as it is non-invasive, highly sensitive, has a high sampling rate and many channels of registration. However, MEG is not without its challenges, like many other multichannel methods. The complicated configuration of brain activity sources, which can be working simultaneously, can make localization of brain activity sources difficult. Further, there is a large amount of data generated and as the magnetic fields produced in the brain are relatively small, the sensing of the magnetic fields is susceptible to external and/or internal noise.",
                        "Current methods of processing MEG data are rough and approximate. For example, using Fourier Transforms that use a short time window leads to a rough frequency grid. That is, the MEG at one frequency can unite many activities and noises that are close in frequency. This can lead to problems when trying to localize the sources using an Inverse Fourier Transform."

                        "Recorded signals from multiple sensors placed on or near a body can be used to localize a signal within the body. FIG. 1 illustrates a system for localizing a signal within a body 102 in accordance with an illustrative implementation. The body 100 can be a constant spatial structure that includes a number of components located within the body 100. The body 100 can be any structure that contains components, such as, but is not limited to, portions of a human body, portions of an animal, a mechanical device, portions of a planet, enclosures containing fluids and/or gases, etc. Practically, any solid can be used as the body 100. The components are generally in a constant position and orientation while the signals are recorded. Although some movement, such as expansion and contraction, of the components are allowed. For example, a heart can be a component of the body 100, which has a constant position and orientation, but is not a constant size. A number of sensors, e.g., 104 and 106, are distributed over the body 100 and record signals from the body 100. A signal is generated by the components, either spontaneously (active media) or evoked by a stimulus (responding media). The signal evoked by the source components must be additive. Each sensor, e.g., 104 and 106, registers the sum of signals, coming from all sources, during a recording time T. As described in greater detail below, the recorded signals can then be used to localize a signal within the body 100. In other words, the spatial structure of the source of a signal can be determined. The spatial structure can be referred to as a functionally invariant entity since it produces the same signal pattern, e.g., normalized pattern as described below, during the recording time. In addition, using signals recorded over the recording time T, the time dependence of a signal sources can be determined.",
                        "FIG. 2 is a flow diagram depicting operations for localizing a signal within a body in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Once any number of sensors have been placed on or near a body, each sensor can record signals detected in body over a time period. In an operation 205, K number of sensors record signals from all sources over a recording time T. The recorded signals include a generated signal within the body as well as other signals from the body. The recorded signals can be described by the following set of functions:",

In addition, the time dependencies of the signals, generated by the components, can be estimated. In an operation 210, a precise Fourier transform of the data from each sensor is calculated. This operation essentially splits the signal in each channel (e.g., from each sensor) to a detailed representation of the signals in frequency space. After the transformation into frequency space, one or more frequencies can be selected for further analysis. In one implementation, the frequencies are selected using a user interface. In an operation 215, the selected frequencies are received from the user interface. An inverse Fourier transform can be done on the selected frequencies in an operation 220. In one implementation, the inverse Fourier transformation of a selected frequency vn in all channels provides the following set of functions:",

If the above set of functions in all channels are coherent, the source pattern will be constant through the reconstructed time. This demonstrates the existence of distinct constant spatial structure at a given frequency of a component within the body.",
                        "The above discussion is independent of the particular body. Accordingly, in order to determine the spatial structure producing the pattern, the characteristics of the given physical model of the body can be investigated. The inverse problem relating to the characteristics of the physical model of the body can be solved. In an operation 230, the inverse problem is solved. This solution determines the spatial structure of the component that generated the signal at vn.",
                        "Components within a body and/or the body itself can product their own signals (spontaneous activity). These spontaneous signals can be recorded by the sensors and analyzed as described above. In addition to spontaneous activity, forced signals can be produced by components within the body and/or the body itself. Forced signals are triggered by an external stimulus. Analysis of these signals can uncover many frequencies that give highly coherent oscillation patterns. These patterns can correspond to reasonable and interpretable inverse problem solutions. The inverse problem solutions allow the study of spatial structures contained within a body and to reconstruct the time course of signals through the body. Examples of analyzing both types of signals are described in greater detail below."

These theoretical considerations are the foundation for the reconstruction of time courses of functional entities with constant spatial structures, performing detailed frequency analysis and studying the similarity of the patterns with high coherence."

The sensors, shown as white squares, are also shown in the magnetic field patterns. Using the data in FIGS. 20A-20E, the distribution of the response energy between harmonics can be found. In addition, the precise frequency-pattern analysis allows the response to be detected even at very high frequencies. Some harmonics, e.g., 4, 5, and 6, produce similar patterns. The time course for the structure that produces the patterns can therefore be found. This is true, even though not all patterns are similar. Differing patterns can mean that the auditory response is produced by different structures. Finally, and as described in greater detail below, the analysis of the 8th harmonic was used to reveal the moving sources corresponding to possible pathways of the auditory nervous signal.",
                                "As noted above, the response is not as symmetric in time compared to the auditory stimulus. Accordingly, all harmonics of the auditory stimulus can be analyzed. FIG. 21 is a graph of precisely tuned multichannel spectrum of measured magnetic fields in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Various spikes in the graph 2100 can be identified as potentially useful frequencies that correspond with a harmonic of the auditory input or as noise. For example, in one implementation, signals 2122 and 2124 can be ignored as noise since they do not correspond to a harmonic of the auditory input. Spikes 2102, 2104, 2106, 2108, and 2120, may correspond with the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 8th harmonic, respectively, and therefore, may be interesting. Noise signals, however, may also be near one or more of the spikes. A more detailed view of the frequency grid can be used to isolate useful frequencies from noise.",
                                "As an example, spike 2120 is near 59 Hz which corresponds to roughly the 8th harmonic of the auditory input, as well as the frequency of alternating current in the United States. Accordingly, noise from a power source may be contributing to the spike 2120. A more detailed view of the frequency grid can be used to separate a useful frequency from noise from a power source. FIG. 22 is a graph of measured magnetic fields spectra in a narrow frequency range that includes the 8th harmonic of the stimulus in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Graph 2200, which is based upon the analysis of the experimental data using the mathematical formulas as described above, shows an interesting spike 2202 that directly corresponds to the 8th harmonic of the auditory input, i.e., \u02dc59.06 Hz. Graph 2200 also allows the identification of spikes 2204 and 2206, which correspond to unwanted noise from power grid. FIG. 23 is a graph of measured magnetic fields spectra in a narrow frequency range that includes the 8th harmonic of the stimulus in accordance with an illustrative implementation. Graph 2300 is an even more detailed view of frequency grid that shows spike 2302 that corresponds to the 8th harmonic of the auditory input, e.g., 59.0568 Hz. Looking at the frequency grid in different scales allows to distinguish between noise and useful signals in order to localize the latter.",
                                "The inverse Fourier transform for the selected harmonics can then be calculated. FIG. 24 is a graph that illustrates phase shifts between channels at the frequency of the 8th harmonic in accordance with an illustrative implementation. The phase shifts between channels lead to the movement of sources of magnetic fields. This estimation of the resulting multichannel time series of MEG data allows for the tracking of movement of the source of the magnetic fields over time.",
                                "As described above, particular frequencies corresponding to spikes in a frequency grid can be selected for use in localizing the source of magnetic field, restored at the spike frequency. Accordingly, the ability to tell noise from a non-noise signal is beneficial. A noise signal is simply a signal that is not to be used in localizing magnetic fields. Depending on the type of analysis being done, a signal may or may not be noise. For example, during spontaneous activity analysis, magnetic fields external to the brain can be considered noise. A spontaneous magnetic field, however, may be considered noise during evoked activity analysis if the spontaneous field does not correspond with a harmonic of the auditory input. Magnetic fields can be identified as non-characteristic for human magnetic fields, if classified as a magnetic field that is external to the brain. As an example, an inverse Fourier transform can be done across all channels at a frequency of 58.979 Hz. As shown in FIG. 22, spike 2206 corresponds with a noise signal\u2014the supposed power grid frequency. The inverse Fourier transform produces data that allows the estimation and localization of the magnetic field to be determined. FIG. 25 illustrates a noise magnetic field in accordance with an illustrative implementation. The noise magnetic field 2500 shows the spatial distribution of the magnetic field across a helmet used to collect the data from sensors 2502. The field maxima 2504 are located near the helmet border, which indicates that the magnetic field is external to the head. Accordingly, this magnetic field can be ignored in the analysis of the data.",

Also the whole body can be measured with appropriate set of sensors. The sensors can record signals generated by components within the body or space. As described above, the recorded signals can be used to generate a multichannel signal that is represented as a sum of elementary coherent oscillations. A partial spectra analysis can be done on the elementary coherent oscillations. A step of the partial spectra analysis is to define the set of frequencies to be studied. In this example, the subject's head was measured by the set of 275 sensors of the magnetic field. A partial spectrum was extracted from the frequency band 1.5-15 Hz of an experimental spectrum of a control subject. FIG. 34 shows the general view of the multichannel spectrum in this band, giving the total decomposition of the MEG to functionally invariant entities. This spectrum contains the peak of alpha activity (9-11 Hz) 3402. After the fourth step of the precise frequency pattern analysis described above, this multichannel spectrum is represented as a sum of 8000 elementary coherent oscillations. In other implementations, the multichannel spectrum can be represented by greater or fewer elementary coherent oscillations. Each elementary oscillation has distinct frequency, constant pattern and is produced by the functional entity having a constant spatial structure. Determining which oscillations to analyze is not trivial.",

In order to build a functional tomogram, in the current example a space is determined as a cube 256 mm\u00d7256 mm\u00d7256 mm, including the subject's head. This cube is divided into Nx\u00d7Ny\u00d7Nz elementary blocks. The edge of the blocks is selected in accordance with desirable spatial resolution, in this illustrative embodiment it is equal to 1 cm. To calculate the energy, produced by all sources, located in the center of the block, a set of trial dipoles can be built. FIG. 35 shows the elementary block of the functional tomogram and the directions of the trial dipoles. The number of trial dipoles can vary and depends on the desirable precision. In this example, the number of trial dipoles is equal to 4. In other examples, the number of trial dipoles could be more or less.",

As can be seen from the FIG. 38, many anatomical details can be reconstructed from the functional tomogram without MRI. In this example, brain (1), neck muscles (2) and olfactory system (3) can be clearly identified.

For example, the anatomical structure determined by the various embodiments can be used as part of treating a patient. In one scenario, a medical device can administer therapeutic agents at targeted sites. For example, an area of the brain the processes a signal input can be targeted for treatment. The processing pathway through the brain can be identified and then one or more therapeutic agents can be administered to part or the entire processing pathway. The therapeutic agents can also be applied to particular anatomical structures of an organ such as the brain or hear based upon the information from the disclosed analytical techniques. For example, a particular area of a structure can be identified and the therapeutic agent can be applied to just the particular area, allowing for a focused application of the therapeutic agent.

The anatomical structure can continue to be monitored, either continuously and on a schedule. The latest anatomical structure can be compared to the baseline to determine if the patient has had a change in condition that requires attention. An alarm can be raised if this is the case.",
