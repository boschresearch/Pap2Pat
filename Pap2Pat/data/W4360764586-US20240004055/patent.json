                        "Applications in the millimeter-wave frequency regime have gained significant interest in the past few years due to the rapid advancement in low cost semiconductor technologies, such as silicon germanium (SiGe) and fine geometry complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Availability of high-speed bipolar and metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors has led to a growing demand for integrated circuits for millimeter-wave applications at e.g., 24 GHz, 60 GHz, 77 GHz, and 80 GHz and also beyond 100 GHz. Such applications include, for example, automotive radar systems and multi-gigabit communication systems.",
                        "In some radar systems, the distance between the radar and a target is determined by transmitting a frequency modulated signal, receiving a reflection of the frequency modulated signal (also referred to as the echo), and determining the distance based on a time delay and/or frequency difference between the transmission and reception of the frequency modulated signal. Accordingly, some radar systems include a transmit antenna to transmit the radio-frequency (RF) signal, and a receive antenna to receive the reflected RF signal, as well as the associated RF circuits used to generate the transmitted signal and to receive the RF signal. In some cases, multiple antennas may be used to implement directional beams using phased array techniques. A multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) configuration with multiple chipsets can be used to perform coherent and non-coherent signal processing as well.",
                        "Besides determining only the distance to a target, tracking of detected targets is desirable in many applications, for example to determine how a target moves from radar frame to radar frame. While this is comparatively straight forward in case a single target is present, for example a single person, it may become a greater challenge in case of multiple targets, for example multiple persons in a scene.",
                        "One approach used for tracking uses a digital filtering of the acquired radar data, for example using a extended or unscented Kalman filter. A Kalman filter or other digital filter may perform the tracking based on various parameters."

These embodiments are given by way of example only and are not to be construed as limiting any way. For example, while embodiments are described including a plurality of features (for example components, elements, acts, events, steps or the like), in other embodiments some of these features may be omitted, or may be replaced by alternative features. Furthermore, in addition to the features explicitly described, other features may be provided, for example features used in conventional radar devices and associated methods.",
                        "Details or variations described with respect to one of the embodiments may also be applied to other embodiments and therefore will not be described repeatedly. Features from different embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments.",
                        "Turning now to the Figures, FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a radar device according to an embodiment. The radar device of FIG. 1 includes a radar front end 11 which transmits radar signals (TX) towards a scene 10 and receives reflected radar signals (RX) from scene 10, for example reflected from objects like persons. Radar front end 11 processes the received radar signals. Such a processing may for example include mixing and the like. Radar front end 11 may be implemented in any conventional manner known to the skilled person. A particular implementation will be discussed further below referring to FIGS. 4 to 6.",
                        "Radar front end outputs analog radar signals ra to processing circuitry 12. Processing circuitry 12 further processes and digitizes the radar signals and outputs digital radar data rd, for example so called radar images. Digital radar data rd is provided to a digital filter 13 in order to obtain information about objects in scene 10, said information labelled td in FIG. 1. For example, information td may be tracking information about objects like persons. Digital filter 13 may be an extended or unscented Kalman filter. Apart from the digital filtering, further conventional processing may be applied to obtain information td.",
                        "Digital filter 13 may perform the filtering based on various parameters, also referred to as hyperparameters herein. For example, such parameters may be parameters of the state transition model or a control input model used by the Kalman filter. Other hyperparameters include process angle variance or measurement noise. In a particular example, digital filter 13 is a tracking filter and may use about 14 adjustable tracking-parameters. These may include for example six parameters for noise measurement/measuring noise, five parameters for processing noise, two parameters for opening and deleting tracks and, finally, a Mahalanobis distance-based gating parameter that decides if a measurement is associated with any track. In summary, the hyperparameters describe and model the scene, where the tracker is performing the location of the target.",
                        "The optimum parameters for processing radar signals obtained from scene 10 depend on the scene and the environment. For example, the optimum parameters may depend on a number of objects, for example a number of people to track, noise, false tracking targets, movement of the target, and the general environment of the objects to be tracked. Optimized parameters for a particular scene tend to give better results than general parameters.",
                        "Therefore, in the radar device of FIG. 1, a machine learning logic 14 sets the parameters p of digital filer 13 based on digital radar data rd2 which may be the same as digital radar data rd, and/or may include data in another stage of the processing pipeline processing the received radar signals.",
                        "A machine learning logic, as used herein, refers to an entity using approaches that learn based on training data or other data to improve its performance. Common types of machine learning logic include artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines and the like. In embodiments, a machine learning logic is used which includes at least a policy network, which provides the parameters p based on data rd2, and a critic network which provides at least one reward value, also referred to as Q-Value, for the choices the policy network makes. An example embodiment of such a machine learning logic is illustrated in FIG. 2.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 2, in an embodiment the machine learning logic includes a policy network 21 and a critic network 22. A policy network is sometimes also referred to as actor network herein. Policy network 21 and critic network 22 may both be implemented as artificial neural networks, for example convolutional neural networks (CNN), including a plurality of layers. Policy network 21, in a trained state, receives radar data rd2 and outputs the parameters p for digital filter 13 of FIG. 1. Critic network 22 also receives radar data rd2 or any other data indicative of the reflected radar signals and also the parameters set by policy network 21 and outputs a plurality of reward values, also referred to as Q-Values, herein. To this end, critic network 22 includes a plurality of heads h1 to hn, where n is equal to or greater than 2. For example, n may be at or around 10.",
                        "In this contribution, head is the terminal part of a network (in this case, the critic network), which is purposed to output a value.",
                        "A head, as used herein, outputs a value which is independent from other given heads, coming from the same network. As will be explained later, different heads may be trained using different training data. For example, the different heads may include completely separate neural networks, together forming critic network 22, or may for example have common input layers and/or intermediate layers, but different output layers and/or other intermediate layers, i.e. may have some common layers, but additionally comprise different layers. Training of the critic network 22 will also be explained later in greater detail.",
                        "As the heads h1 to hn were trained differently, e.g. using different training data, they yield different reward values. In case the scene to be processed, as represented by radar data rd2, is within the trained range, however, the reward values output by heads h1 to hn will be comparatively close to each other, i.e. have a narrow distribution. If, however, the scene 10 to be processed is rather outside of a trained range of the network, the distribution will be broader. The trained range is e.g. a range of objects (number, type or the like) covered by the training data For instance, training data in a training phase of the machine learning logic of FIG. 2 may include scenes with up to three objects to be tracked by digital filer 13. If a scene to be processed then includes four or five objects, this is outside the trained range, and typically leads to a broader distribution of the reward values provided by heads h1 to hn. The reward value is generated by heads h1 to hn are provided to an out of distribution (OOD) detection 23. Based on the distribution of the reward values, OOD detection 23 detects if the scene 10 to be processed is outside the training range. For example, OOD detection 23 may compare the standard deviation of the distribution of reward values generated by heads h1 to hn with a predefined threshold value, and if the standard deviation exceeds the threshold value, decides on an out of distribution event. In other embodiments, OOD detection 23 may check if one or more values generated by heads h1 to hn are outside an expected distribution width, obtained for example based on training data. This, in turn, indicates that the result td of digital filter 13, which was obtained based on parameters p set by machine learning logic 14, may not be reliable, for example that the tracking result may be erroneous. In other words, the out of distribution event indicates a comparatively high likelihood that information, e.g. tracking information, td output by digital filter 13 is erroneous, for example that the tracking result does not correctly indicate the actual moving objects like persons in scene 10.",
                        "FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating a method according to an embodiment. The method of FIG. 3 may be implemented in the radar device illustrated with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2 or other radar devices, for example radar devices as explained further below. To avoid repetitions, the method of FIG. 3 will be discussed referring to the previous explanations for FIGS. 1 and 2.",

                        "At 31, the method comprises processing the reflected radar signal to obtain a digital signal, for example by radar front end 11 and processing circuitry 12 of FIG. 1.",
                        "At 32, the method comprises setting a filter parameter of a digital filter based on the digital signal, as explained for digital filter 13 in FIG. 1, using a machine learning logic like machine learning logic 14, for example implemented as explained with respect to FIG. 2.",

Each channel may be described as a Gaussian distribution (taking mean and variance over available vectors of the same feature). A weighted sum over all the different Gaussian distributions over the channels is obtained to provide a descriptor for each cell, where the descriptor is associated with all the feature types and which may be a value or vector that is indicative of the characteristics (features) of the associated cluster and which may be used to determine how similar are clusters.

As will be described in more detail later, in some embodiments, detected targets are associated to respective tracks using feature-based template matching (during step 318). For example, in some embodiments, geometric features are used during step 318 for template matching. A geometric feature may be understood as a feature that is recognizable despite changes in rotation of the target, as well as changes in the range, Doppler velocity, and angle of the centroid of the target. In some embodiments a geometric feature may include a physical geometric feature, such as physical edges of the target (e.g., from the radar image). In some embodiments, additionally or alternatively, a geometric feature may include a metric (e.g., a vector, function, or group of functions) based on the relationship between cells of the raw data (e.g., of the data cube), such as the relationship between range cells, Doppler velocity cells, and/or angle cells. Examples of such metric include functions extracted using functional decomposition of the data cube, gradients of the data cube, and/or statistical properties of the data cube (such as histograms/PDF of the data cube). Examples of geometric features include EMD features and SIFT features.",

Detected targets at time step i+1 are assigned to respective tracks based on the similarities between feature vectors (e.g., based on the error between the feature vectors), e.g., using Hungarian assignment. For example, in some embodiments, a similarity measure is identified between feature clusters at consecutive time steps (e.g., i, and i+1), and the assignments that minimize the error (e.g., increase correlation) between feature clusters is selected for track assignment.",

Once there is a convergence in the training process (i.e. no improvement over time), the training is concluded. In inference, i.e. in actual use of the device including the machine learning logic after training, both policy and critic network are used, where the policy network chooses hyperparameters for the digital filter, e.g. tracking filter, and the critic network determines out-of-distribution characteristics of the captured scene as will be explained below in more detail.",

The policy network is trained based on reward values output by the critic network. Simultaneously, the critic network may be trained. In conventional reinforcement learning, in contrast to supervised learning, no specific annotated training data is necessary, but reward values may be generated based a measurable result, for example. In embodiments discussed herein, in contrast to such \u201cpure\u201d reinforcement learning, training data may be annotated, meaning that for example the number of objects to be tracked in a scene and/or their movement is a priori known for the training data, such that the desired result of the tracking is known.",

The machine learning logic, besides the state St acts on the reward value Rt. In the present example, this means that generally for a given radar data, the machine learning logic sets certain tracking parameters, which lead to tracked data as to tracked data as a result.",

An inner loop 82 corresponds to the reinforcement learning scheme of FIG. 7, where machine learning logic 70, also referred to as agent, receives training signals. An outer loop 81 represents the meta-reinforcement learning. Training is performed based on a distribution of environments, and for example some environments may be used for training the \u201cinner loop\u201d, i.e. the reinforcement learning, and other environments may be used for the \u201couter loop\u201d 81, i.e. the meta-reinforcement learning, which allows a generalization. The meta-reinforcement learning may be performed as off policy meta-reinforcement learning via probabilistic context variables, as described for example in K.

For example, e may be added as noise in a layer of the critic network, for example in a second last layer before the output. In this case, for example for radar frames including a high number of people, the diversity of the Q-Values generated by the heads is enhanced, which may lead to an improved out of distribution detection.",
                        "To illustrate this concept, FIG. 13 illustrates a standard deviation of critic heads over a number of people in the scene. In the example shown, for example the networks have been trained for scenes with up to three people. Due to this, the standard deviation for up to three people is low, but increases significantly when more people, i.e. four or five people, to be tracked are in the scene. As four or five people is outside the range the networks were trained with, the detection and tracking is not as reliable, and this may be detected by the out of distribution detection.",
                        "FIG. 14 further illustrates the concept discussed herein for radar tracking parameters optimization. The example of FIG. 14 shows two successive frames. In a first frame 1401 radar data 1402A is provided, for example range angle data or range Doppler data as illustrated at 1403A. A tracking filter 1404 filters this data based on initial hyperparameters to provide a heat map 1405A and a predicted target based on the tracking, 1406A. Based on the heat map, a machine learning logic 1407, which may be implemented as discussed above, updates the hyper parameters for tracker 1404. Therefore, next radar data 1402B, for example range angle data or range Doppler data 1403B) is processed by tracker 1404 with the updated parameter, which in turn leads to an updated heat map 1405B and an updated predicted target 1406B, which in turn are provided to machine learning logic 1407 for a next frame.",
