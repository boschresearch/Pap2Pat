                        "Proteins are biomolecules or macromolecules composed of long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform many significant life activities in organisms, and functions of proteins are mainly determined by their three-dimensional (3D) structures. Knowing the structures of proteins is very important to the fields of medicine and biotechnology. For example, if a certain protein plays a key role in a disease, drug molecules can be designed based on the structure of the protein to treat the disease. However, it is quite time-consuming to determine the structures of proteins through experiments, and there are only a small number of proteins whose structures are determined through experiments. Therefore, protein structure prediction at a low cost and with a high yield has become an important means for protein structure research."

The neural network used in the deep learning applications generally includes a plurality of hidden layers to extend the depth of the network. Individual layers of the neural network model are connected in sequence, such that an output of a preceding layer is provided as an input for a following layer, where the input layer receives the input of the neural network while the output of the output layer acts as the final output of the neural network.

The secondary structure refers to a specific conformation formed by main chain atoms along a certain axis, and includes \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-fold and random coil. The tertiary structure refers to a three-dimensional spatial structure formed through further coiling and folding of the protein on the basis of the secondary structure. A protein fragment (also referred to as a \u201cfragment\u201d for short) comprises a segment of continuous amino acid residues arranged in a three-dimensional spatial structure.",
                        "As mentioned above, the structure of a protein mainly affects its functionality, and protein structure prediction has become an important means for studying protein structure. Fragment assembly is an approach for protein structure prediction, and the quality of fragment libraries is a critical factor affecting the accuracy of fragment assembly. A fragment library is built based on fragments of a protein with a known structure (e.g., native fragments, near-native fragments). For a target protein of which the structure is to be predicted, different fragment library building algorithms may pick up as many native or near-native fragments as possible for each residue position (also referred to as \u201cposition) of the target protein.",

Although the fragment library is used in fragment assembly, the structural information contained in the fragment library has not yet been analyzed and leveraged. In addition, the structure prediction in fragment assembly is a Monte Carlo simulation process, which is very time-consuming.",
                        "Using gradient descent to fold a protein structure is another approach for protein structure prediction. In this approach, the protein structure is folded by optimizing potentials derived from predicted structural properties. The predicted structural properties may mainly comprise, for example, torsion angles and distances between C atoms and N atoms on the main chain. Given that the potentials are mainly derived from the predicted structural properties, the accuracy of the predicted structural properties, to a large extent, determines the quality of final predicted structures.",
                        "Currently, features widely used for protein structure prediction are those derived from protein amino acid sequences. That is, this approach only utilizes information of amino acid sequences but fails to exploit structural information contained in the fragment library.",

In the solution, a plurality of fragments is determined, from a fragment library for a target protein, for each of a plurality of residue positions of the target protein. Each fragment comprises a plurality of amino acid residues. Then, a feature representation of the structures of the plurality of fragments is generated for each residue position. Next, at least one of the structure and a structural property of the target protein is determined based on respective feature representations generated for the plurality of residue positions. In this way, the solution can leverage structural information of fragment libraries to complement and complete information used in protein structure prediction, and the accuracy of protein structure prediction is thus improved.",

As used herein, a residue position (also referred to as \u201cposition\u201d for short) of the target protein corresponds to an amino acid residue in the target protein.

In addition, in some implementations of the present disclosure, a structural property of the target protein may be predicted. To better understand the implementations of the present disclosure, reference is made to FIG. 2 to describe structural properties of proteins. A fragment 200 shown in FIG. 2 comprises residues 210, 220 and 230. Each residue comprises N atoms, C\u03b1 atoms and C atoms on the main chain, as well as C\u03b2 atoms and O atoms on side chains.",

Inter-residue distances may comprise distances between the same type of atoms in two resides, such as a C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance and a C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distance. The C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance refers to a distance between pairwise C\u03b1-C\u03b1 atoms (also referred to as an inter-residue C\u03b1 distance). The C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance may comprise a distance between a pair of neighboring C\u03b1 atoms or a distance between a pair of any non-neighboring C\u03b1 atoms, such as a distance between any two of C\u03b1 atoms 211, 221 and 231 in FIG. 2.

The torsion angle \u03c9 refers to a dihedral angle for a chemical bond C\u2014N. For examples, with respect to the residues 220 and 210, the torsion angle \u03c6 is a dihedral angle for a chemical bond between the N atom 224 and the C\u03b1 atom 221. With respect to the residues 220 and 230, the torsion angle in is a dihedral angle for a chemical bond between the C atom 223 and the N atom 234.

The backbone angle \u03c4 refers to a dihedral angle for a C\u03b1-C\u03b1 chemical bond of neighboring residues.

A difference between the reference property values and a true property value of the same structural property may be used as an evaluation metric. Evaluation metrics for evaluating fragment libraries built by different algorithms usually comprise precision and coverage. Precision is the proportion of good fragments in the whole fragment library and coverage is the proportion of positions which are spanned by at least one good fragment, where a good fragment is a fragment whose root-mean-square error (RMSD) with respect to the true fragment at a position is lower than a given RMSD.

                                "Finally, in an averaging process 530, an output tensor with L\u00d7d dimension may be obtained as the fragment library feature set 430, by averaging all the F fragments at the same residue position. A 1\u00d7d vector corresponding to each residue position in the fragment library feature set 430 may be regarded as the feature representation of the fragment determined for the residue position.",
                                "Reference is made back to FIG. 4. The fragment library feature set 430 with L\u00d7d dimension is inputted into a trained property predictor 440. The property predictor 440 also receives a sequence feature set 450 of an amino acid sequence of the target protein. The sequence feature set 450 may comprise at least one of: an elementary sequence of the target protein, the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) of homologous proteins and the pairwise statistics derived from direct coupling analysis (DCA). For example, the fragment library feature set 430 outputted by the feature encoder 420 as well as the one-hot codes of the elementary sequence of the target protein and PSSM may be transformed into a two-dimensional representation by tiling both horizontally and vertically, which is then concatenated with the pairwise statistics to form the total input of the property predictor 440. The property predictor 440 is trained to predict structural properties 460 of the target protein based on feature representations of the fragments in the fragment library and the feature representation of the amino acid sequence. The predicted structural properties 460 comprise for example torsion angles \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c9, bond lengths between C\u2014N, N\u2014C\u03b1 and C\u03b1-C atoms of each residue, and bond angles of C\u03b1-C\u2014N, C\u2014N\u2014C\u03b1 and N\u2014C\u03b1-C of each residue, the C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance, and the C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distance, as shown in FIG. 4.",

The fragment library feature set 430 and the sequence feature set 450 inputted to the property predictor 440 may first be processed by a pre-processing block 610. As an example, the pre-processing block 610 may comprise a two-dimensional convolutional layer, a batch normalization layer and an ELU activation layer, etc. A two-dimensional residual neural network with a plurality of (e.g., residual blocks follows the pre-processing block 610. As an example, FIG. 6 shows that each residual block may comprise two convolutional layers 621, 625 and two ELU activation layers 623, 627. In addition, to prevent overfitting, batch normalization layers 622, 626 may be adopted after the convolutional layers 621, 625 and a dropout layer 624, with a dropout rate of e.g., 0.15, may be used.",
                                "A symmetrization operation 630 is performed on the output of the residual network. The output of the symmetrization operation 630 is then inputted into two respective branches to predict different structural properties. The left branch shown in FIG. 6 comprises a pooling layer 640, which converts the two-dimensional feature map outputted by the symmetrization operation 630 into a one-dimensional feature vector. Subsequently, the one-dimensional feature vector is inputted into a fully connected layer 650, which outputs 1D structural properties of each residue of the target protein, e.g., torsion angles \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c9, bond lengths and bond angles between continuous backbone atoms. The right branch shown in FIG. 6 directly predicts the C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance and the C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distance using the fully connected layer 660. In this example, the property predictor 440 may be implemented as a multi-task predictor to simultaneously predict a plurality of structural properties of the target protein.",

In such implementations, structural features of fragments in the fragment library are implicitly represented using features generated by the feature encoder.
