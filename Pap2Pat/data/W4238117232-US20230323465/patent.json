                        "Thyroid cancer incidence is rapidly increasing worldwide. In the United States, its prevalence has nearly quadrupled over the past 15 years, predominantly due to the increased incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (1). Thyroid nodules are detectable by ultrasound in over 50% of the adult population, and fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytopathology is the most accurate means of pre-operative diagnosis. However, up to 30% of the FNA samples result in indeterminate cytology: atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (Bethesda III), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (Bethesda IV), and suspicious for malignancy (Bethesda V) (2), demonstrating inherent limitations of visual microscopic diagnosis. The situation has been further complicated by the recent reclassification in the American Thyroid Association management guidelines for thyroid tumors of a previously considered malignant subgroup of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) to the noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), an indolent neoplasm with questionable malignant potential (3). NIFTP cannot be differentiated from invasive FVPTC by cytopathology, however, and requires histopathologic evaluation for diagnosis (2,4).",
                        "In the last decade, molecular testing has emerged as a promising strategy for the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules to enable clinicians to better tailor surgical interventions and avoid overtreatment of benign disease. ThyroSeq v3 next generation sequencing (CBL Path, Rye Brook, NY) (5) Afirma gene expression with recently upgraded gene sequencing classifiers (Veracyte, South San Francisco, CA)(6), and ThygenX/ThyraMIR gene mutation and miRNA analysis (Interpace Diagnostics, Parsippany, NJ) (7) are major molecular tests currently in clinical use in the United States. The DNA-based tests, however, are limited by the prevalence of several of the assessed mutations in benign thyroid lesions (8,9), and all tests suffer from a lack of specificity after the introduction of the newly defined NIFTP subtype (10-13). Indeed, both ThyroSeq and Afirma tests currently report NIFTP as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201csuspicious\u201d for malignant disease. In a recent study, the positive predictive value (PPV) of ThyroSeq mutational analysis panels (including 7-gene ThyroSeq and ThyroSeq V2) decreased from 43% to 14% and Afirma gene expression classifier from 30% to 25% (14), if NIFTP was classified as non-malignant.",
                        "While molecular testing is a promising strategy for preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules, it further presents unique challenges for molecular assays including contaminating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and variable numbers of evaluable epithelial thyroid cells. Moreover, the newly recognized entity, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP), has added an additional challenge to the currently available molecular diagnostic platforms. New diagnostic tools are still needed to correctly distinguish benign and malignant thyroid nodules preoperatively."

Indeed, current molecular tests assessing thyroid nodules that cannot be assessed through cytology suffer from lack of specificity and high false positive rates, resulting in unnecessary surgery. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a RT-PCR based assay with the ability to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules with high specificity and/or distinguish indolent (slow growing) from metastatic (aggressive) cancers. The present invention can reduce unnecessary surgical thyroid procedures for benign cases and/or inform on appropriate surgical procedure or monitoring for indolent versus metastatic cases.",
                        "As described herein, twenty-two transcript splice variants from 12 genes we previously identified as discriminating benign from malignant thyroid nodules were characterized in 80 frozen thyroid tumors from 8 histological subtypes. Isoforms detectable in PBMC were excluded, and the 5 most discriminating isoforms were further validated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) on intraoperative FNA samples from 59 malignant tumors, 55 benign nodules, and 23 NIFTP samples. The qPCR threshold cycle values for each transcript were normalized to the thyrocyte-specific thyroid peroxidase isoform 1 (TPO1) and z-transformed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of the composite transcript scores were used to evaluate classification of thyroid FNAs by the 5-gene isoform expression panel.",
                        "In particular embodiments, a molecular signature was developed by combining expression levels of specific isoforms of CDH3, FNDC4, HMGA2, KLK7, and PLAG1. FNAs containing at least 12-36 thyrocytes were sufficient for this assay. The 5-gene composite score achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.86 for distinguishing malignant from benign nodules, with a specificity of 91%, sensitivity of 75%, negative predictive value of 91% and positive predictive value of 74%. This 5-gene isoform expression panel embodiment distinguishes benign from malignant thyroid tumors and, may help distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules in the context of the new NIFTP subtype."

Environmental conditions conducive to synthesis include the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for polymerization, such as DNA polymerase, and a suitable temperature and pH. The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may be double stranded; if double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxy ribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent for polymerization. The exact length of primer will depend on many factors, including application, temperature to be employed, template reaction conditions, other reagents, and source of primers.

In particular embodiments, all that is required is that the molecules (e.g., nucleic acids or polypeptides) remain immobilized or attached to a support under conditions in which it is intended to use the support, for example in applications requiring nucleic acid amplification and/or sequencing or in in antibody-binding assays. For example, oligonucleotides or primers are immobilized such that a 3\u2032 end is available for enzymatic extension and/or at least a portion of the sequence is capable of hybridizing to a complementary sequence.

                                "In certain embodiments, a sample from a subject with or suspected of having thyroid cancer is processed prior to detection or quantification. For example, nucleic acid and/or proteins may be extracted, isolated, and/or purified from a sample prior to analysis. Various DNA, mRNA, and/or protein extraction techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. Processing may include centrifugation, ultracentrifugation, ethanol precipitation, filtration, fractionation, resuspension, dilution, concentration, etc. In some embodiments, methods and systems provide detection (e.g., quantification of RNA or protein biomarkers) from raw sample (e.g., biological fluid such as blood, serum, etc.) without or with limited processing. In some examples, whole cells or tissue sections are isolated and analyzed for expression such as using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry.",
                                "Methods may comprise steps of homogenizing a sample in a suitable buffer, removal of contaminants and/or assay inhibitors, adding a biomarker capture reagent (e.g., a magnetic bead to which is linked an oligonucleotide complementary to a biomarker), incubated under conditions that promote the association (e.g., by hybridization) of the target biomarker with the capture reagent to produce a target biomarker: capture reagent complex, incubating the target biomarker: capture complex under target biomarker-release conditions. In some embodiments, multiple biomarkers are isolated in each round of isolation by adding multiple biomarkers capture reagents (e.g., specific to the desired biomarkers) to the solution. For example, multiple biomarker capture reagents, each comprising an oligonucleotide specific for a different biomarker can be added to the sample for isolation/detection/measurement of multiple biomarkers. It is contemplated that the methods encompass multiple experimental designs that vary both in the number of capture steps and in the number of target biomarkers captured in each capture step.",
                                "In some embodiments, capture reagents are molecules, moieties, substances, or compositions that preferentially (e.g., specifically and selectively) interact with a particular biomarker sought to be isolated, purified, detected, and/or quantified. Any capture reagent having desired binding affinity and/or specificity to the particular biomarker can be used in the present technology.",
                                "For example, the capture reagent can be a macromolecule such as a peptide, a protein (e.g., an antibody or other ligand that specifically binds to the biomarker), an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid (e.g., nucleic acids capable of hybridizing with the biomarker gene), oligosaccharides, carbohydrates, lipids, or small molecules, or a complex thereof. As illustrative and non-limiting examples, an avidin target capture reagent may be used to isolate and purify targets comprising a biotin moiety, an antibody may be used to isolate and purify targets comprising the appropriate antigen or epitope, and an oligonucleotide may be used to isolate and purify a complementary polynucleotide.",
                                "Any nucleic acids, including single-stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids, which are capable of binding, or specifically binding, to a target biomarker can be used as the capture reagent. Examples of such nucleic acids include DNA, RNA, aptamers, peptide nucleic acids, and other modifications to the sugar, phosphate, or nucleoside base. Thus, there are many strategies for capturing a target and accordingly many types of capture reagents are known to those in the art.",
                                "In addition, target biomarker capture reagents may comprise a functionality to localize, concentrate, aggregate, etc., the capture reagent and thus provide a way to isolate and purify the target biomarker when captured (e.g., bound, hybridized, etc.) to the capture reagent (e.g., when a target: capture reagent complex is formed). For example, in some embodiments the portion of the capture reagent that interacts with the biomarker (e.g., an oligonucleotide) is linked to a solid support (e.g., a bead, surface, resin, column, and the like) that allows manipulation by the user on a macroscopic scale. Often, the solid support allows the use of a mechanical means to isolate and purify the target: capture reagent complex from a heterogeneous solution. For example, when linked to a bead, separation is achieved by removing the bead from the heterogeneous solution, e.g., by physical movement. In embodiments in which the bead is magnetic or paramagnetic, a magnetic field is used to achieve physical separation of the capture reagent (and thus the target biomarker) from the heterogeneous solution.",
                                "The target biomarker may be quantified or detected using any suitable technique. In specific embodiments, the biomarker is quantified using reagents that determine the level, abundance or amount of the individual biomarker, either as isolated biomarker or as expressed in or on a cell. Non-limiting reagents of this type include reagents for use in nucleic acid- and protein-based assays, as described below."

By repeating these steps multiple times, a DNA fragment is amplified to produce an amplicon, corresponding to the target DNA sequence. Typical PCR reactions include about 20 or more cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension. In many cases, the annealing and extension steps can be performed concurrently, in which case the cycle contains only two steps. Because mature mRNA are single-stranded, a reverse transcription reaction (which produces a complementary cDNA sequence) may be performed prior to PCR reactions. Reverse transcription reactions include the use of, e.g., a RNA-based DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) and a primer.",

In certain embodiments, a primer is about 15 to about 35 nucleotides in length.

In such methods, after hybridization between a probe and the targeted nucleic acid, the probe is modified to distinguish the hybridized probe from the unhybridized probe. Thereafter, the probe may be amplified and/or detected. In general, a probe inactivation region comprises a subset of nucleotides within the target hybridization region of the probe. To reduce or prevent amplification or detection of a HARP probe that is not hybridized to its target nucleic acid, and thus allow detection of the target nucleic acid, a post-hybridization probe inactivation step is carried out using an agent which is able to distinguish between a HARP probe that is hybridized to its targeted nucleic acid sequence and the corresponding unhybridized HARP probe. The agent is able to inactivate or modify the unhybridized HARP probe such that it cannot be amplified.",

After washing to remove unbound material, a second, detection, antibody that binds to a different, non-overlapping, epitope on the biomarker (or to the bound capture antibody) is then used to detect binding of the polypeptide biomarker to the capture antibody. The detection antibody is preferably conjugated, either directly or indirectly, to a detectable moiety. Examples of detectable moieties that can be employed in such methods include, but are not limited to, cheminescent and luminescent agents; fluorophores such as fluorescein, rhodamine and eosin; radioisotopes; colorimetric agents; and enzyme-substrate labels, such as biotin.",

In a follow-up study, we further characterized 14 of these transcripts by a combination of immunohistochemical and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays, and identified a candidate 3-gene panel as a potential preoperative diagnostic tool for FNA samples (16).",
                        "As described herein, we selected 12 of the 14 genes based on their diagnostic performance in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, to determine if newly characterized specific isoforms further improved their diagnostic performance, including cases of the pathologically confirmed NIFTP tumor subtype. We also investigated isoforms of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) to identify a thyrocyte-specific load control, since, in contrast to qualitative markers such as mutations, quantitative molecular assessments are complicated by highly variable samples and admixture of non-thyroid derived cells like peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Finally, we tested our 5 best performing candidate isoforms directly in intra-operatively obtained FNA samples."

Intraoperative FNAs were collected from the tumor with a 25-gauge needle syringe immediately prior to resection and preserved in 95% Ethanol at -20\u00b0 C., or in RNALater at -80\u00b0 C. The FNA site was marked intraoperatively to ensure correlation with the final pathological diagnosis. During pathological prosection, an aliquot of tumor tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0 C. Tumor tissue was identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining of frozen tissue sections, and final surgical pathological diagnoses of samples were confirmed by a pathologist. All FVPTCs were re-reviewed to allow reclassification of NIFTPs from FVPTCs where indicated. PBMCs were isolated from patient blood drawn intraoperatively with Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) and stored at -80\u00b0 C.",

Total RNA from single pass FNA samples was isolated using GenElute Single Cell RNA Purification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Because of the variable number of thyroid cells in individual FNA samples, the entire total RNA elution volume (11 \u00b5l) was used for cDNA synthesis.",

The 22 selected transcript isoforms were characterized on frozen tumor tissue samples from 15 ANs, 14 FAs, 10 HAs, 5 NIFTPs, 7 FVPTCs, 7 HCs, 7 FCs, and 15 PTCs, using semi-quantitative PCR. Five transcript isoforms from the following genes: CDH3, FNDC4, HMGA2, KLK7, PLAG1 showed the most differential expression among thyroid cancers, NIFTPs, and benign tumors (Table 1, FIG. 1), as determined by image analysis of agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. Importantly, none of the isoforms were detectable in PBMCs from 31 patients (FIG. 5). Among the candidate thyrocyte load-control isoforms of TPO and thyroglobulin tested, TPO1 was the only isoform not detectable in PBMCs (FIG. 6) and stably expressed across the well-differentiated thyroid tumor subtypes (FIG. 1A). Therefore, TPO1 was selected as the load control for thyroid cell content of FNA samples.",

Seven (4.4%) of the 159 FNA samples tested had no detectable TPO1 expression with 40 qPCR cycles and, were therefore excluded from the study. Serial dilutions of thyroid tissue-derived RNA revealed that TPO1 was detectable at 30 qPCR cycles using a minimum of 370 pg of total RNA, which corresponds to the total RNA of approximately 12-36 cells (18), lower than the cytopathological threshold of minimal thyrocyte content in FNA samples (6 clusters of at least 10 follicular epithelial cells on 2 or more slides)(19). We therefore selected a TPO1 threshold Ct value of 30 to include FNA samples for our study, a criterion met by a total of 137 of 159 (86.2%) FNA samples tested. There was no significant difference in the fail rates across the diagnostic subgroups tested. Table 2 summarizes the patient information for the FNAs used.",

Overall performance was measured as the AUC, which was 0.86. Several combinations of sensitivity and specificity, representing points along the ROC curve, are shown in Table 3 as well. One of these combinations is highlighted on the ROC curve and on the strip-plots in FIG. 2. Corresponding to a threshold for the composite expression score (z-\u0394Ct) of -1, this value was chosen to maximize sensitivity (75%) while controlling specificity above 90% (actual value = 91%). Forty-four of 59 (74.6%) malignant thyroid tumors had a composite score > -1, (23/25, 92.0% of PTCs; 21/34, 61.8% of FVPTCs), while only 7 out of 78 (9.0%) benign and NIFTP nodules had a score > -1 (6/23, 26.1% of NIFTPs; 1/14, 7.1% of HAs; 0/16 of FAs; and 0/25, 0% of ANs; p < 0.0001).",

                                "In the past decade, molecular testing has emerged as a promising method to increase the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of malignant thyroid tumors. Several molecular diagnostic tests, including RNA based gene expression and multi-panel mutation genotyping analysis are commercially available for clinical use (17,20). Available tests remain, however, limited by relatively low specificity and PPV (21,22). Furthermore, the recent reclassification of a subgroup of malignant FVPTC to clinically \u201cbenign\u201d NIFTP has further complicated the situation, since prior publications assessing the performance of commercially available molecular tests were based upon NIFTP being categorized as malignant. Indeed, most NIFTPs were reported as suspicious/malignant by expression based Afirma or mutation and gene fusion based ThyroSeq in several studies (14,21,23,24).",
                                "Our group previously carried out a series of studies to identify genetic markers for distinguishing cancer from benign thyroid tumors using genome-wide gene expression arrays (15,16). In this study, we have developed a molecular test for evaluating preoperative thyroid FNAs taking NIFTP lesions into consideration, by further characterizing isoforms of our previously profiled gene candidates.",
                                "Taking advantage of the improved annotation of the human genome over the last decade, we first explored expression of a broad range of splice variants of our 12 gene set in frozen thyroid tumor samples to select candidates which were differentially expressed in benign and malignant neoplasms. In this study, the 5 isoforms of CDH3, FNDC4, HMGA2, KLK7, and PLAG1 we identified showed potential in differentiating different thyroid tumor subtypes, and importantly, were chosen because they were not expressed in PBMCs. In FNA samples, quantitative molecular tests must address the contribution from PBMCs. Positive or negative selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads can minimize their contribution, but their use decreases overall assay sensitivity (data not shown). In the absence of selection, the load control reference gene needs to reflect the number of thyrocytes in FNA samples rather than a standard total RNA content measure. In our study, we tested two isoforms of TPO and two of thyroglobulin. Only TPO1 was found to have constant levels of expression across differentiated thyroid tumor subtypes (FIG. 1A) and importantly, was undetectable by PCR after 40 cycles in any of the 31 PBMC samples obtained perioperatively (FIG. 6). We did observe, however, a decrease in TPO 1 expression in one large HC metastasis, possibly a consequence of loss of differentiation in this recurrent advanced tumor.",
                                "The 5-isoform panel was tested using our intraoperative FNA samples. In this study, only a single pass of needle aspirate from each tumor was used for our analysis. To ensure the reliability of the assay, only samples reaching a TPO1 threshold of detectability of 30 cycles or less were included in this study. Only 7 (4.4%) of FNA samples showed no detectable TPO1, and 137 (86.2%) of 159 FNA samples met our threshold and produced reliable gene expression profiles. This compares favorably with reported 2-20% of cases yielding cytopathologically non-diagnostic results with two to five FNA passes (25).",
                                "In our study, quantitative PCR data generated from 137 qualified FNA samples demonstrated a differential expression among benign and malignant thyroid tumors. The ROC analysis shows our 5-isoform panel has an 86% ability to distinguish benign thyroid tumors (AN, FA, and HA) and NIFTP from malignant tumors (FVPTC and PTC), with a specificity of 91% at a sensitivity of 75%, resulting in an NPV of 91% and a PPV of 74%.",
                                "The thyroid follicular-patterned lesions, FA, NIFTP, and FVPTC, contribute the most to the indeterminate cytologies. Molecularly, they all are frequently associated with RAS mutations (26). Currently, histologic evaluation of capsule and vascular invasion is necessary for diagnosis of NIFTP. Thus, an accurate diagnosis of NIFTP is impossible by preoperative cytology or mutation based molecular tests. Nevertheless, NIFTP is an indolent lesion with <1% risk of recurrence (27), and should not be treated as thyroid cancer, although it may warrant resection as potential premalignant lesion.",
                                "The NIFTP classification is new. Currently, the reclassified indolent NIFTP is still considered as a surgical disease by most endocrinologists. Its separation from malignant FVPTC may significantly impact clinical treatment decisions, leading to lesser surgical and other ablative procedures, and potentially simple observation as therapeutic options, which are currently under active investigation. More studies, especially prospective long-term follow-up studies, are needed to evaluate its behavior, progression, and optimal management. Finding tools for accurate preoperative identification of NIFTP will promote the study and management for this lesion. The data presented here show our newly developed 5-isoform panel may reduce cytologically and molecularly indeterminate diagnoses.",
                                "Our study also has a number of limitations, foremost the number of available intraoperative FNAs, which also do not exactly replicate the standard preoperative diagnostic FNAs typically obtained percutaneously in a clinic setting. We limited ourselves to epithelial thyroid tumors, and were unable to obtain FNA samples from the infrequent FC and HC cases encountered in the timespan samples were collected for this study. Therefore, although the available FC and HC tissue samples had high scores, suggesting the selected isoform panel may do well diagnostically, the performance of the panel in these cases remains unknown for FNAs."

                                "The goal of this Example was to develop a high sensitivity and specificity test to evaluate preoperative thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology material. FNAs are obtained as an outpatient procedure and are considered standard of practice in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules. Although FNA cytology is the most accurate means of diagnosing thyroid nodules, up to 40% of FNA samples are reported as \u201csuspicious\u201d or \u201cindeterminate\u201d, often resulting in more extensive surgery than would be necessary for benign or indolent tumors.",
                                "The present Example was designed to further characterize and improve a gene expression signature derived from a series of studies performed to discover genetic markers that differentiated thyroid cancer from benign thyroid tumors using genome-wide gene expression arrays. Starting with differentially expressed genes, 12 were characterized by immunohistochemical assays on tissue sections, a PCR-based assay of these genes was developed, and an initial expression signature of 3 genes was generated that achieved 84% specificity and 71% sensitivity in discriminating benign from malignant thyroid tumors.",
                                "In order to improve on these results, and taking advantage of the improving annotation of the human genome over the last decade, the present inventors first explored a broad range of splice variants of the original 12 gene set, with the goal of identifying variants that showed low or no expression in non-thyroid cells, such as white blood cells. This was critical since FNA samples typically are heavily contaminated with blood, and while this can be mitigated by antibody-coated magnetic bead purification steps, which was also explored in this project, each additional process leads to losses and decreases overall assay sensitivity.",
                                "The initial set of experiments was focused on testing a wide range on potentially diagnostic splice variants. This aspect was performed using samples from a frozen tissue bank, and allowed the identification of several promising gene transcript variants.",
                                "The next phase involved developing quantitative real-time PCR versions for these candidate transcripts and determining transcript abundance based on threshold PCR-cycle (Ct) rather than by semiquantitative gel-based assays. At the same time, several complementary approaches were developed to address the inherent issues associated with clinical FNA samples including dealing with the inevitable blood contamination, as well as variable and unpredictable numbers of thyroid-derived epithelial cells present in the samples. To address the former, both positive and negative selection strategies were used based on epithelial or WBC-specific antibody-coated magnetic beads. These were successful, but did negatively impact overall sensitivity, as expected for any purification method. Therefore, the present inventors also explored an alternative approach that avoided this step, but required two conditions to be successful: first, the selected gene expression markers had to remain at undetectable levels in contaminating WBCs; and second, a thyrocyte-specific, but universally expressed marker was needed to serve as thyrocyte load control. Several candidates were tested, and the TPO gene (thyroid peroxidase) was chosen for its consistent expression levels across a variety of histological thyroid tumors and benign conditions.",
                                "In the final phase of the present Example, qPCR of selected markers was performed on a cohort of samples from an archival FNA collection, as well as from freshly collected samples to test the approach in circumstances closely resembling the clinical setting.",
                                "FIGS. 7-8 show the data obtained testing various gene expression markers on thyroid tumor tissue samples of various subtypes. The tumor subtypes tested included: Adenomatoid Nodules (AN), Follicular Adenomas (FA), Encapsulated FVPTC (EFV), Follicular variant of PTC (FV), and Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).",
                                "Of particular interest is the EFV subtype, also known as NIFTP, which is a new subcategory of tumors morphologically similar to FVPTC, but encapsulated and with no evidence of invasive behavior. Until the recent revision of the ATA treatment guidelines for thyroid neoplasia, this subtype was classified as malignant, often leading to total thyroidectomy. This has now been reclassified as benign lesion, with lesser surgical procedures and potentially simple observation as therapeutic options, which are currently under active investigation.",
                                "The present inventors favored a more extensive exploration of a wider set of candidate expression markers, including many potential splice variants, to optimize the ability to find signatures not only discriminating benign from malignant tumors, but specifically also of use in correctly classifying the new NIFTP subset of tumors, which all current commercially available molecular tests misclassify as malignant.",
                                "Therefore, the present inventors focused on signatures that ideally classified NIFTP cases as either intermediate or largely in the benign category, with the understanding that individual NIFTP could legitimately show results consistent with malignancy, as these may well be precursor lesions, for which a more aggressive therapeutic approach may be appropriate. As FIGS. 4-5 illustrate, several of the candidate markers and signatures score the NIPFP tumors in an intermediate range.",
                                "FIG. 9 illustrates the effect of shifting from the standard housekeeping gene GapDH to the thyrocyte-specific TPO gene as load control for the qPCR assays performed on FNA material. The most significant effect of this modification was to allow the removal of samples that would have been scored as false negative due to lack of signal, but were in fact devoid of thyroid epithelial cells.",
                                "FIGS. 10-11 illustrate the results of the final set of diagnostic markers when tested on a validation cohort of archival FNA samples consisting of 22 benign and 18 malignant tumors, classifying the 6 NIFTP cases as benign. The problematic NIFTP class scores well within the benign tumor range, defined here simply as the average minus 1 standard deviation of AN & FA samples in this test cohort.",
                                "Using the approach indicated above, the present inventors achieved an overall assay sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 86% in the 3-gene model, and almost identical results with a 5-gene model combining HMGA2, PLAG1, KLK7, FNDC4, and CDH3. This is remarkable because the experimental approach is directly applicable to the clinical setting, and includes a significant subset of typically misclassified NIFPT cases.",
                                "It is also worth noting that avoiding the need to enrich for thyroid cells in the archival FNA samples improved assay sensitivity from about 50% to 75%, based on a detectable TPO signal. This improved further to 90% on fresh FNA samples with magnetic bead enrichment, and the most recent experience on a limited number of fresh FNA samples avoiding bead enrichment resulted in no samples without detectable TPO signal so far."
