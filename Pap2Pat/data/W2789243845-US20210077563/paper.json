    "title": "Aggregating sequences that occur in many proteins constitute weak spots of bacterial proteostasis",
    "date": "2018-02-28",
    "abstract": "Aggregation is a sequence-specific process, nucleated by short aggregation-prone regions (APRs) that can be exploited to induce aggregation of proteins containing the same APR. Here, we find that most APRs are unique within a proteome, but that a small minority of APRs occur in many proteins. When aggregation is nucleated in bacteria by such frequently occurring APRs, it leads to massive and lethal inclusion body formation containing a large number of proteins. Buildup of bacterial resistance against these peptides is slow. In addition, the approach is effective against drug-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii , reducing bacterial load in a murine bladder infection model. Our results indicate that redundant APRs are weak points of bacterial protein homeostasis and that targeting these may be an attractive antibacterial strategy.",

                "Loss of protein homeostasis1 is a constant threat for any living cell due to the highly crowded intracellular environment that brings into close proximity a large variety of polypeptides that need to undergo error-prone folding reactions in order to attain their native conformation2. To control this threat, cells have evolved a complex network of molecular chaperones, proteases, and other specialized molecules3. In spite of these cellular-response mechanisms, human protein-folding pathologies have made it clear that under persistent exposure to aggregating proteins, for example, as a result of mutation, protein homeostasis can eventually break down, which ultimately results in cell death4. On the other hand, protein aggregation turns out to be a highly ordered and specific process: aggregation is more efficient between similar than between unrelated polypeptides5\u20137. At a mechanistic level, protein aggregation is mediated by short (between 5 and 15 residues) aggregation-prone sequence segments (called APRs), which on average occur at least once every 100 amino acids in the primary polypeptide sequence8. These APRs are generally sequence segments constituting the hydrophobic core of globular proteins or protein\u2013protein interaction interfaces9. While forming the most stable part of the native proteins, in unfolded proteins, APRs can also self-assemble with identical APRs from another protein to form \u03b2-structured aggregates10. The risk of aggregation is thus the highest during translation before the protein attains its native conformation11. As the sequence of most APRs is unique within a given proteome7, aggregation will generally be restricted to identical proteins. However, a minority of APRs (or close homologs thereof) are found in several and sometimes many different proteins7. Given the sequence specificity of aggregation, this suggests that these proteins could coaggregate via such a common APR. The redundancy of these APRs therefore also suggests that they might constitute particularly vulnerable proteomic segments, and that under conditions of stress, these might act as hot spots for the initiation of proteostatic collapse.",
                "In order to test this concept, here, we screen 125 aggregating sequences that have a high degree of redundancy in the Escherichia coli proteome. In this manner, one peptide containing this APR could potentially affect the folding of many proteins containing highly similar APRs. Using this strategy, we identify several peptides that efficiently induce bactericidal protein aggregation and inclusion body (IB) formation in E. coli. This process is bactericidal to E. coli as well as Acinetobacter baumannii, including clinical strains that are resistant to current antibiotics. Analyzing these peptides in E. coli in more detail using several molecular and proteomic approaches, we find that these peptides induce widespread aggregation of bacterial proteins, resulting in bactericidal aggregation cascades involving hundreds of proteins. Moreover, the peptides effectively reduce bacterial load in a murine bladder E. coli infection model, suggesting that redundant APRs in bacterial proteomes can be targeted for therapeutic purposes."

                        "We used the statistical thermodynamics algorithm TANGO to analyze the aggregation propensity and APR redundancy of the E. coli strain O157:H7 proteome. This yielded 3,535 APR sequences of at least six amino acids in length with a TANGO score of at least 20%. Given the length limitation of roughly 20 amino acids in solid-phase peptide synthesis with regard to yield and purity, our peptide design imposes a maximum length on the APRs that can be accommodated (APRs will be incorporated in a tandem repeat design peptide comprising twice the APR flanked by three gatekeeper arginine residues and linked by a single proline; see below), forcing us to restrict our experimental analysis to the 1,542 APRs with a length of seven amino acids. To analyze the redundancy of these sequences, we calculated for each of these APRs the number of times their sequence occurred in other proteins in the E. coli proteome, considering zero, one, or two amino acid mutations (Fig.\u00a01a). This shows that for more than 80% of the seven-residue APRs, their exact sequence is unique in the E. coli proteome, while virtually no heptameric APR is found in more than five different proteins (Fig.\u00a01a, red line). This observation might be related to the previous finding that selective pressure shapes sequence divergence in repeat-domain proteins such as titin in order to avoid interdomain aggregation12. Allowing one mutation in the APR (85% APR sequence identity), we found that the number of unique APRs drops to 20% (Fig.\u00a01a, blue line), but there is almost no heptameric APR sequence that possesses more than 10 APR homologs with a single-point mutation in other E. coli proteins. This suggests that while one mutation is in many instances probably sufficient to avoid coaggregation (especially hydrophobic to charged-residue mutations), several single-point mutations will still allow for coaggregation (especially conservative hydrophobic mutations), which is confirmed by previous observations6,13. Finally, allowing for two mutations (70% APR sequence identity), we found that most APRs have more than 10 homologous APRs (Fig.\u00a01a, green line); this suggests that at 70% sequence divergence (i.e., two mismatches in a heptameric sequence), coaggregation may be a rare occurrence, although it should still not be excluded. Indeed, Fig.\u00a01a (green line) also suggests that high redundancy of two mismatch mutations (above 30) is still to be avoided. Very similar distributions of the number of homologous or identical APRs could also be observed in other bacterial proteomes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and A. baumannii (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), suggesting that this is a universal feature of bacterial proteomes.Fig. 1Proteome analysis, design, and screening of redundant APRs. a Distribution of the redundancy of APR sequences of length seven in the E. coli proteome: percentage of identical sequences (red), one mismatch (blue), and two mismatches (green). b Same distribution as in a for the 75 most redundant APRs in E. coli. c Design pattern for aggregating peptide screen.

                        "To experimentally investigate the impact of APR redundancy on the proteostatic robustness of the E. coli proteome, we ranked APRs at the extreme of the redundancy distribution in Fig.\u00a01a, showing up to 10 matches with one mismatch mutation and up to 100 matches with two mutations, and selected the first 75 most frequently occurring sequences from this list (Supplementary Table\u00a01). The extreme values of these APRs are apparent from Fig.\u00a01b, showing an enrichment of tail values of the E. coli APR redundancy distribution displayed in Fig.\u00a01a. Counting all amino acid substitutions as equal in terms of their likely \u03b2-interaction with the bait sequence is only a very rough approximation, but one that needs to be made since reliably separating amino acid substitutions that are conducive of \u03b2-interaction from those that are not is beyond the scope of current prediction algorithms."

                        "In order to generate efficient aggregation seeds, here, we employed a tandem repeat design previously validated14,15, in which the redundant APR is incorporated as a tandem repeat separated by a linker constituted by a single proline. In order to increase the colloidal stability of these aggregating peptides, the APRs are flanked by aggregation gatekeepers, a class of residues that was previously shown to reduce aggregation kinetics8,16,17. Since positively charged residues have also been shown to help bacterial uptake18, we selected arginine to obtain the following peptide layout: R-APR-RR (Fig.\u00a01c). To further modulate the kinetics of aggregation of these peptides, we also added two variants of each of the first 25 peptides in the list by randomly mutating one residue in the first APR repeat to arginine (Supplementary Table\u00a01). These 100 peptides were generated using solid-phase synthesis at 200-nmol scale and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a theoretical stock concentration of 2\u2009mM (by assuming 100% synthesis efficiency).",
                        "As we were looking for peptides capable of inducing a lethal proteostatic collapse, our primary screen consisted of measuring the effect of our peptides on the growth of E. coli O157:H7 at dilutions of the peptide corresponding to concentrations of 1, 6, 12, and 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Although no peptide inhibited bacterial growth at the highest dilution, 43 of them inhibited bacterial growth of E. coli O157 at 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL, of which 11 were still active at 12\u2009\u03bcg/mL and six had an apparent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 6\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Supplementary Table\u00a02). We separated the original 75 APRs into two groups based on their inhibitor activity: the hits listed in Supplementary Table\u00a02 and the inactive peptides. We then compared the sequence redundancy in the E. coli proteome of the APRs in both groups and found that the number of sequence matches found at both one and two mutations distance were significantly higher in the active group than in the inactive group (Fig.\u00a01d, e). This shows that a high APR redundancy is associated to bacterial cell death, suggesting that these sequences could indeed represent proteomic weak spots of susceptibility for proteostatic collapse."

                        "In order to investigate whether APR redundancy does result in proteostatic collapse, we selected resynthesized and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified four positive peptides from the screen, P2, P5, P14, and P105, as well as three negative peptides, P3, P4, and P11, and confirmed their MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values (Table\u00a01). Analysis of the rate of peptide bactericidal activity against E. coli O157:H7 (at MIC concentration) showed that the peptides exerted full bactericidal effect within 30\u2009min to 2\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01f). Biophysical analysis of the P2 peptide in vitro, using mass spectrometry (MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and tinctorial assays confirmed the intrinsic aggregation propensity of the P2 peptide (Supplementary Note\u00a01 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Cross-section TEM of peptide-treated bacteria revealed the widespread presence of large IBs, a hallmark of protein aggregation in E. coli, suggesting that the peptides act by interfering with bacterial proteostasis (Fig.\u00a01g\u2013i). These IBs, which are also called large polar aggregates19, could be stained with pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid (pFTAA, Fig.\u00a01j and supplementary Fig.\u00a03), an extensively characterized amyloid-specific dye20\u201322, which specifically binds to amyloid-like aggregates as well as disease-associated protein IBs22. This IB-staining pattern could be observed for all bactericidal peptides, but not for any of the other peptides, although some other pFTAA-positive structures could be discerned (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). We confirmed the cross-\u03b2-structure content of IB using thioflavin-T staining and correlative atomic force microscopy nanoimaging and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Supplementary Note\u00a02 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). These data show that aggregation, resulting in cross-\u03b2-structure-enriched IBs, is a crucial property of the bactericidal peptide treatment.Table 1MIC and MBC values of selected peptides purified by HPLC grade on E. coli O157Purified peptideSequencesMIC (\u03bcg/mL)MBC (\u03bcg/mL)P2RGLGLALVRRPRGLGLALVRR66P2ProRGLGPALPRRPRGLGPALPRR>100>100P5RALLTTLLRRPRALLTTLLRR66P5RRRALLTTLLRRPRALLTTLLRR1212P105RALLRTLLRRPRALLTTLLRR1212P14RGLLALLARRPRGLLALLARR66MIC minimum inhibitory concentration, MBC minimum bactericidal concentration, HPLC high-performance liquid chromatography",
                        "When bacteria were repeatedly passaged on sublethal concentrations (50% of MIC) of the active peptides for a period of 36 days, no development of resistance was observed, whereas this was the case for the control antibiotic ampicillin (Fig.\u00a01k). These data are supportive of a mode of action involving many targets throughout the E. coli proteome. To investigate this in more detail, peptide P2 was selected for further analysis. As a control, we generated a variant of P2, called P2Pro, in which we introduced proline substitutions at two positions in the APRs (Table\u00a01), which conserve the hydrophobicity but disrupt the \u03b2-sheet propensity and hence reduce the aggregation propensity of the peptides23. When we treated bacteria with the control peptides, we obtained MIC values of more than 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL, indicating again that \u03b2-aggregation is key for the bactericidal effect of P2.",
                        "We derivatized P2 with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and established that the conjugate retained its antibacterial activity (MIC\u2009=\u20093\u2009\u03bcg/mL against E. coli O157:H7) and quantified P2 uptake over time by flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013f). Analysis of P2 uptake by E. coli O157:H7 showed that after 15\u2009min, 97.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9% (N\u2009=\u20094, mean and s.d.) of the cells are positive for FITC (Fig.\u00a02b, f), increasing to nearly 100% after 1\u2009h and beyond (Fig.\u00a02c\u2013f). In parallel, fluorescence microscopy of treated E. coli O157:H7 at MIC concentration confirmed no enrichment at the cell membrane of FITC-P2, but rather showed a clear accumulation of fluorescence in intracellular polar IBs from 15\u2009min onward (Fig.\u00a02g) that persisted at later time points (Fig.\u00a02h) and thus confirmed the cross-section TEM images (Fig.\u00a01g\u2013i). Kinetics of bacterial cell death as measured by colony-forming unit (CFU) determination after P2 treatment (Fig.\u00a02i) closely follow peptide internalization and coincide with the appearance of IBs after 15\u2009min of treatment (50% after 15\u2009min). On the other hand, bacterial cell death as monitored by propidium iodide (PI) uptake as a result of membrane permeabilization increased more slowly (2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3% after 15\u2009min to 85\u2009\u00b1\u200913.2% after 3\u2009h, Fig.\u00a02a\u2013e, summarized in Fig.\u00a02j, N\u2009=\u20094). This was confirmed by morphological analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Supplementary Note\u00a03 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05).Fig. 2Uptake and inclusion body formation. a\u2013e Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of 40,000 E. coli O157: H7 cells, measuring FITC fluorescence (x-axis) and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (y-axis) of a untreated and heat-inactivated bacteria mixed at a ratio of 1:1 and b\u2013e bacteria treated for 15\u2009min (b), 1\u2009h (c), 3\u2009h (d), and 6\u2009h (e) with FITC-labeled P2 at MIC concentration. f Average population sizes of FITC-positive cells treated with FITC-P2 or FITC-P2Pro from four independent experiments such as those shown in b\u2013e. g Wide-field structured illumination microscopy (SIM) image of E. coli treated with FITC-P2 for 15\u2009min and h for 1\u2009h at MIC concentration. i Time-dependent cell death following P2 treatment (1\u2009x\u2009MIC) as % CFU/mL, in E. coli O157:H7. j Average population sizes of PI-positive cells (propidium iodide) from four independent FACS experiments such as those shown in a\u2013e. k FACS analysis of 40,000 E. coli O157:H7 cells, measuring pFTAA fluorescence (x-axis) and PI fluorescence (y-axis) after 3\u2009h of treatment with P2 at MIC concentration. l Same as h, but after treatment with 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL P2Pro",
                        "Together, these data demonstrate that P2 uptake and IB formation occur in close succession, and this is followed by cell death. Cell death precedes membrane disruption as significant growth inhibition is established coincidentally with IB formation but before membrane permeability or deformation can be observed. Importantly, all PI-positive cells stain positive for aggregation by pFTAA (Fig.\u00a02k) and when bacteria were treated with FITC-P2Pro, which showed comparable uptake to P2 (Fig.\u00a02f), no protein aggregation ensued (Fig.\u00a02l) and hence no cell death could be detected (Fig.\u00a02l). This again shows that aggregation of the peptide is essential to mediate its bactericidal effect."

                        "Bacterial IB formation is a common event associated with cellular stress including exposure to heat and, perhaps most famously, recombinant protein (over)expression24. This process, however, is often transient and reversible and does not necessarily lead to bacterial cell death. In fact, recombinant protein production in bacteria relies to a large extent on the ability of bacteria to cope with IBs. As an example, we measured the consequences of overexpressing the highly aggregation-prone core domain of the human p53 protein (p53CD) on growth (Fig.\u00a03a) and colony formation (Fig.\u00a03b) of E. coli BL21 cells, which are routinely used for recombinant protein production. Although p53CD expression resulted in a delay of the exponential growth phase, consistent with cellular stress resulting from overexpression, there was no effect on colony formation, showing that the stress in this condition is not lethal. In order to understand why P2-induced IB formation is irreversibly toxic, we compared the composition of IBs purified from E. coli O157:H7 cells treated with P2 at MIC concentration for 1\u2009h with IBs purified from E. coli strain BL21 overnight overexpressing p53CD. Inspection of the resulting samples by TEM confirmed the successful purification of these IBs (Fig.\u00a03c). The composition of IBs was subsequently analyzed by Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig.\u00a03d). The overall pattern of Coomassie staining revealed that a large number of similar bacterial proteins are trapped in the IBs of both P2-treated E. coli O157:H7 and p53CD-overexpressing E. coli BL21, but not in untreated bacteria, suggesting a common molecular machinery associated with IB formation. In the p53CD IBs, the band corresponding to the molecular weight of p53CD and western blot is clearly visible using the p53 mouse monoclonal antibody pAb240 that recognizes a linear epitope located in the p53CD construct25 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). Among the proteins trapped in both types of IBs, a number of molecular chaperones that are known to occur in IBs26 could be detected, including the bacterial heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) homolog DnaK, the Hsp60 chaperonin GroEL, the ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor (TF), and the bacterial Hsp40 DnaJ (Fig.\u00a03e). The polar localization of a fluorescently traceable DnaK-mCerulean3 fusion protein (the latter moiety comprising a blue fluorescent protein) in E. coli K-12 MG1655 cells exposed to P2 confirms the association of DnaK with IBs (Fig.\u00a03f).Fig. 3Inclusion body formation and proteostatic collapse. a Growth curve of E. coli BL21-overexpressing p53CD (red) and control in the presence (green) or absence (blue) of P2 (average and SD of three replicates). p53CD bacterial growth in the presence of 0.4\u2009mM IPTG. b Colony formation by E. coli BL21 p53CD-overexpressing bacteria.

Significant differences from the WT are calculated using ordinary one-way ANOVA and Dunnett\u2019s multiple-comparison test. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.01, ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.001, ****P\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001",
                        "We then investigated the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGEs of IBs isolated both from E. coli O157:H7 and BL21:DE3 upon treatment with the remaining active and inactive peptides, which showed a similar high-intensity pattern of IB-associated proteins for the bactericidal peptides, which was absent or much reduced in the inactive peptides (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07). So, when peptides with redundant APRs successfully induce aggregation in the cell, the process is bactericidal, but when a similar degree of aggregation is caused by the overexpression of a protein that is alien to this strain, it is not significantly toxic. These observations show that any toxicity that is associated with IB formation depends on the proteins that are aggregating into the IBs: a heterologous protein that aggregates does not represent a loss of an essential cellular function, and is hence not likely to be toxic. On the other hand, the simultaneous aggregation of many of the bacterial cell\u2019s own proteins would eventually be expected to accumulate such high and pleiotropic levels of loss of function that cellular viability is ultimately irreversibly impaired. As a confirmation, we generated a tandem peptide that follows our design pattern, but that instead of a bacterial fragment contains an APR from p53CD and indeed found this not to be toxic to E. coli (Supplementary Note\u00a04, Supplementary Figs.\u00a07 and 8). This shows that aggregating peptides of this design are not toxic per se, but that their bactericidal effect depends on the induction of the aggregation of cellular proteins."

In total, 541 proteins were detected in the P2-induced IBs, suggesting that the bactericidal impact of P2 treatment corresponds to an extensive proteome-wide aggregation of proteins, in line with our initial design that aimed at inducing the collapse of protein homeostasis by aggregation of multiple proteins. Apart from the chaperones, the IBs were strongly enriched in ribosomal proteins (NCBI DAVID27, 47 genes, enrichment score of 26.12, Benjamini P value <\u200910\u221298), indicating that protein aggregation in response to P2 may occur cotranslationally. To verify this hypothesis, we measured the MBC value of P2 in the presence of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, which is a bacteriostatic drug that acts by blocking the polypeptide exit channel in the ribosome. We observed a marked desensitization of bacteria (E. coli O157) (MBC\u2009>\u2009100\u2009\u03bcg/mL) to P2 after pretreating the cells with 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL erythromycin for 2\u2009h to block translation during peptide exposure, strongly supporting cotranslational induction of protein aggregation by P2 (Fig.\u00a03g). In line with this, we observed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) that there was no buildup of pFTAA staining in the P2-treated bacteria in the presence of erythromycin (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), even though the uptake of FITC-P2 was not impaired by the presence of the ribosome inhibitor (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). These data show that in the absence of protein translation, there is no induction of protein aggregation and that this eliminates the bactericidal effect, again showing that the peptide needs to induce protein aggregation in the bacteria to mediate cell death. The data in Supplementary Fig.\u00a09 additionally demonstrate that the contribution of P2 itself to the pFTAA staining is small compared to the bacterial proteins that aggregate in the IBs, meaning that the lack of pFTAA staining in cells treated with P2Pro (Fig.\u00a02l) really comes from the failure of this peptide to induce aggregation of bacterial proteins. In combination, the effect of erythromycin on P2 and the comparison of P2 with P2Pro establish a causal link between cotranslational induction of the aggregation of many bacterial proteins and the bactericidal effect of P2. Moreover, we could detect eight proteins that contain a sequence fragment similar to the APR of P2, including the HcaB protein from which the sequence was derived, and could integrate the other proteins in the IBs as nodes in an aggregation network connected by sequence-specific coaggregation edges (Supplementary Note\u00a05, Supplementary Table\u00a03, Supplementary Figs.\u00a011, 12, 13, 14, and Supplementary Data\u00a01).",
                        "If the bactericidal effect of P2 is indeed mediated by a loss of protein homeostasis, the cellular chaperone machinery would be expected to counteract or limit the effect of the peptide. In order to evaluate this, we determined the effect of P2 on 18 gene deletion strains for major bacterial chaperones and proteases in the E. coli K-12 BW25113 strain (taken from the KEIO collection28) and found that from the individual knockouts of the principal proteostatic components of E. coli, only the hsp70 dnaK and the small Hsp, hsp31, had a mild effect on the MIC value of P2 (Table\u00a02). To ensure that this effect was not due to the reduced overall viability of the dnaK deletion strain, we also tested the MIC value at 30\u2009\u00b0C and obtained the same result (MIC\u2009=\u20096\u2009\u03bcg/mL). This confirms that the direct inhibition of chaperones and proteases is not the principal mechanism of action of P2. However, in several of the chaperone or protease deletion strains, the percent of bacterial cell survival after 1\u2009h was significantly decreased for several deletion strains compared to the wild-type strain (Fig.\u00a03h), showing that cell killing occurred much faster in the absence of certain chaperones. The deletion strains with the strongest effect largely matched those found in the IBs by MS, including those of the cotranslationally acting chaperones TF (tig), dnaK (Hsp70 family), and its cochaperone dnaJ, as well as the small Hsps hchA (Hsp31), hslO (Hsp33), and ipbA (\u03b1-crystallin family). The disaggregase clpB and the aggregation-controlling protease lon also had strong effects. A similar picture emerged when we analyzed the sensitivity of E. coli BL21 after overexpression of selected chaperones: there was no effect on the MIC values, but the cell killing was slowed down compared to the wild-type strain in this experiment when the groEL/ES and dnaK/J/grpE systems were expressed in combination (Fig.\u00a03i & Table\u00a03). This demonstrates that the protein quality control (PQC) machinery temporarily opposes the aggregation induced by the P2 peptide, but is eventually overwhelmed and ends up associated to the aggregated proteins in the IB fraction.Table 2MIC of P2 for chaperone deletion strainsGene deletionMIC (\u03bcg/mL)Protein nameDescriptionKEIO WT12\u2206 clpP12ClpPProteolytic subunit of the Clp protease\u2206 clpA12ClpASubstrate-specifying adapter for the Clp protease\u2206 clpS12ClpSSpecificity adapter for the Clp protease (binds to and modulates ClpA)\u2206 clpX12ClpXATP-binding subunit of the Clp protease\u2206 lon12LonATP-dependent protease, required for suppression of aggregation\u2206 sulA12SulASuppressor of Lon\u2206 clpB12ClpBDisaggregase of the Hsp100 family\u2206 dnaK6DnaKFolding chaperone of the Hsp70 family\u2206 dnaJ12DnaJCochaperone to DnaK of the Hsp40 family\u2206 grpEn/aGrpENucleotide exchange factor for DnaK\u2206 htpG12Folding chaperone of the Hsp90 family\u2206 groL12GroELFolding chaperone of the Hsp60 family\u2206 groSn/aGroESCochaperone of Hsp60, of the Hsp10 family\u2206 hslO12Hsp33Oxidative stress-induced holdase\u2206 hchA6Hsp31Heat-dependent and temperature-stress-dependent holdase\u2206 ibpA12IbpASmall Hsp of the \u03b1-crystallin family\u2206 ibpB12ibpBSmall Hsp of the \u03b1-crystallin family\u2206 tig12Trigger factorCotranslational folding chaperone, ribosome-associatedMIC minimum inhibitory concentration, WTwild type, Hsp heat shock proteinTable 3MIC of P2 after chaperone overexpression in BL21PlasmidOverexpressed chaperone(s)MIC (\u03bcg/mL)pG-KJE8dnaK-dnaJ-grpE groES-groEL25pGro7groES-groEL25pKJE7dnaK-dnaJ-grpE25pG-Tf2groES-groEL-tig25pTf16tig25wt\u201425MIC minimum inhibitory concentration"

                        "To better understand the importance of the quantity and identity of proteins pulled into aggregates in distinguishing between lethal aggregation and controlled, nontoxic IB formation, we performed a large-scale MS proteomics experiment, comparing IB composition from control conditions to those formed upon overexpression of p53CD with treatment with toxic (P2, P5, and P14) and nontoxic peptides (P2Pro, P4), as detailed in Supplementary Note\u00a06, Supplementary Data\u00a02 and 3, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a015. The first observation that stands out in this analysis is that IBs associated with lethal conditions contain significantly more proteins than those associated to nontoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016A). A common core of IBs was defined by identifying a large group of 424 proteins that are present in IBs of untreated, as well as toxic and nontoxic peptide-treated BL21. This common core appears to be primarily composed of the molecular machinery required to mediate and control IB formation, as well as other proteins that appear to associate to IBs for reasons that are less obvious (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017A and B). The former category comprises the molecular chaperones, such as the chaperonin groE, the bacterial hsp70 dnaK, the disaggregase clpB, the cotranslational foldase TF, and, to a lesser extent, the bacterial Hsp90 htpG among others (Supplementary Fig.\u00a018).",
                        "All structural constituents of the ribosome and other elements involved in the control of protein translation also commonly dominate the formation of IBs irrespective of the peptide treatment (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017C and D). However, in addition to this common core of proteins, each IB contains an additional set of polypeptides specifically associated to each condition (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014B). Of all the samples, the IBs resulting from the overexpression of the p53CD protein contain the smallest number of additional proteins (eight proteins, including p53CD). The p53CD polypeptide strongly dominates the composition of the IBs from the overexpressing cells (Fig.\u00a03d). This indicates that the heterologous expression of p53CD leads to IBs that essentially consist of a large quantity of the overexpressed protein, plus the proteins typically found in the IB fraction across conditions. This makes sense in the context of recombinant protein purification from such IBs and explains the lack of toxicity observed under these conditions. It is also in line with the notion that p53CD aggregation constitutes a proteostatic stress that, contrary to P2, does not cause a proteostatic collapse and is not lethal to the bacterial cell. In the IBs from nonlethal conditions, including p53CD, P2Pro, and P4, we detect fewer additional proteins than in the IBs from lethal conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a016B). Moreover, these additional proteins in the nonlethal IBs are often from the same functional categories as the GO enrichments associated to the common core, suggesting that the formation of nontoxic IBs is a more controlled process than those formed in the lethal conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017). In the IBs from lethal conditions combined (P2, P5, and P14), we found between 47 and 154 bacterial proteins in addition to the typical IB proteins found in the common core, with contrasting molecular functions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a017C), showing what a devastating impact these peptides have on the PQC, and confirming the notion that peptides containing redundant APRs cause widespread protein aggregation. The isolated genetic deletion of many of these elements individually completely impairs viability. So, it may be unsurprising that the accumulated loss of many of these proteins is lethal, even if the knockdown of each individual protein is likely to be less complete than in the genetic deletion.",
                        "In conclusion, the MS data presented here are in good agreement with the notion that our peptides cause a pleiotropic and accumulated loss of function to protein aggregation that is eventually lethal."

                        "Since bioinformatics analysis showed that our peptides differ markedly from existing antimicrobial peptides (Supplementary Note\u00a07), we wanted to know if the induction of proteostatic collapse mediated by P2 could be exploited as an antimicrobial peptide.",
                        "We tested the uptake of P2 in other bacterial strains and found peptide uptake in several different bacterial species (Supplementary Fig.\u00a019). Then, we proceeded to test the activity of P2 against 17 clinical isolates of E. coli and 15 of A. baumannii, which displayed a varying spectrum of resistance against well-established antibiotics (Supplementary Table\u00a04). We found P2 to be effective on 16 out of 17 of the tested E. coli strains and 14 out of 15 of the Acinetobacter strains, including those resistant to the last-resort carbapenems. As a first indication of specificity of the peptides, we demonstrated that there were no hemolytic-to-human erythrocytes (Fig.\u00a04a), suggesting that the bactericidal effect of P2 is not the result of a generic toxicity. This was further confirmed by CellTiter Blue (Fig.\u00a04b) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (Fig.\u00a04c) assays to assess the cytotoxicity of the peptide for HeLa cells. The specificity of P2 for E. coli O157:H7 was estimated by determining the concentration at which bacterial growth is 50% inhibited (IC50\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and compared to the concentration at which the peptide induces 50% lysis of human erythrocytes (LC50\u2009=\u20091,100\u2009\u03bcg/mL), yielding an apparent therapeutic ratio of 730. In order to test the in vivo potential of P2, we treated a coculture of mammalian (HeLa) cells and E. coli O157:H7 with P2 and observed the preferential accumulation of P2 in bacteria but not in mammalian cells (Fig.\u00a04d). In addition, we tested the cross-reactivity of P2 aggregation with known disease-associated amyloidogenic peptides in vitro by spiking P2 into freshly dissolved preparations of the human Alzheimer \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide or the human islet amyloid polypeptide and did not observe an increase of the rate of aggregation of these peptides (Fig.\u00a04e, f), showing that the peptide is not a general inducer of protein aggregation. We did, however, observe a delay in the aggregation onset of the A\u03b2 peptide, suggesting that a transient interaction did take place (Fig.\u00a04e). Finally, we found that P2 incubated in 25 or 50% human serum for 2\u2009h was still able to inhibit bacterial growth at 25 and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a04g). Moreover, initial experiments outlined in Supplementary Note\u00a08 showed that mice tolerated P2 treatments well (Supplementary Tables\u00a05, 6 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a020, 21, and 22 and Fig.\u00a04h).Fig. 4Cross-seeding and in vivo activity. a Concentration-dependent hemolysis of human erythrocytes by selected peptides (average and SD of three replicates) shown as percent of hemolysis compared to 1% Triton. b, c Cytoxicity of P2 (black bars) and P2Pro (gray) to human HeLa cells measured using the CellTiter Blue assay (b) (average and SD of three replicates) and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay (average and SD of three replicates), represented as percentage of cell survival compared to control. d Fluorescence micrography of HeLa cells mixed with E. coli O157:H7, treated with FITC-P2 (green channel).

The bacterial load of mice infected with E. coli O157:H7 transurethrally was determined after treatment with P2 (P2 administered urethrally (P2 UT) or intraperitoneally (P2 IP)) and controls (ampicillin administered orally (Amp.oral), buffer (mock), and P2Pro administered urethrally (P2Pro2.UT)) in i kidney, j colon, k bladder, and l ureter. Each treatment group consisted of 15 animals. Bacterial loads are expressed as log10(CFU/mL). See text and Methods for more details.

                        "Based on these observations, we tested the antibacterial efficacy of the P2 in a mouse bladder infection model. In this model, an inoculum of 50\u2009\u03bcL of a 108\u2009CFU/mL suspension of E. coli O157:H7 was delivered via the urethra to the bladder of healthy Swiss mice. One hour post infection, we administered a single injection of P2 at 10\u2009mg/kg, either via the urethra (denoted at UT, n\u2009=\u200915) or intraperitoneally (denoted as IP, n\u2009=\u200915). As a positive control, we included ampicillin treatment, which was administered orally (20\u2009mg/kg), while P2Pro was administered urethrally (10\u2009mg/kg) and buffer treatment served as negative controls. Twenty-four hours after treatment, the animals were killed and the bacterial titer in kidney, colon, bladder, and ureter was determined by plating the macerated tissue (Fig.\u00a04i\u2013l). These experiments revealed a significant reduction of the bacterial titer in the different organs of P2-treated animals (P value <10\u22124 compared to buffer control and P value <10\u22124 compared to nonaggregating P2Pro control, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's posttest). The log-fold reduction of the average bacterial load ranged from 2.3 in the ureter to 3.0 in the kidney after IP delivery and from 2.6 in the colon to 3.1 in the ureter upon UT delivery. The effect was comparable to orally dosed ampicillin (20\u2009mg/kg) in the ureter, but P2 treatment was better in reduction of the bacterial load in the other tissues, ranging from 1.48 log-fold in the colon to 2.0 log-fold in the bladder. These results clearly indicate that the antimicrobial activity of P2 against E. coli is maintained in vivo."

                "The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections represents one of the major healthcare challenges of the coming decade(s), but alternative treatment options are currently not available29. We present here a class of peptides with a strong bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli and A. baumannii, both in vitro and in a bladder infection model in the mouse. These peptides act by inducing widespread protein aggregation in these bacteria, eventually causing cell death by overcoming the bacterial protein homeostasis system. Protein misfolding and aggregation are relatively common events under normal physiological conditions and are increased under conditions of stress such as heat shock, but the PQC controls the process and avoids that it degenerates. For example, upon recombinant production of heterologous proteins in bacteria, the aggregating protein is stored into IBs, and little or no toxicity is associated. However, human protein aggregation diseases revealed that when stress is too intense or sustained, the capacity of the PQC to control misfolding events is exceeded, resulting in protein aggregation and IB formation30\u201332. Here, we exploit this concept to induce toxic protein aggregation in the Gram-negative bacteria by using aggregation-prone peptides whose sequence is based on aggregation protein sequences that occur in many bacterial proteins. The idea is that these peptides will cause aggregation of many different bacterial proteins that share this short seven-amino-acid stretch. The pleiotropic loss of function of many proteins at the same time eventually overcomes the capacity of the PQC to correct the problem and the viability of the cell is negatively affected. Because the approach disrupts an essential process by targeting many different proteins, we hope that the emergence of resistance may be inherently more difficult for the bacteria than for single-target approaches. Indeed, repeated passaging of bacteria on sublethal concentrations of the active peptides for a period of 36 days did not result in the development of resistance contrary to the control of the antibiotic ampicillin.",
                "Our method is based on the notion that protein aggregation is a sequence-specific process that is nucleated by, and can thus be induced with, short APRs within a protein that self-assemble to form aggregates8,33\u201335. Most proteins possess at least one APR in their sequence. We recently demonstrated, however, that most of these aggregation-prone sequences are unique in a proteome7,10. In other words, when a protein aggregates, it will generally only aggregate with identical proteins. We previously exploited the fact that aggregation is sequence specific and that most aggregating sequences are sparse in a proteome to induce specific protein knockdown of target proteins in plants15 and mammalian cells23, or to achieve protein detection in western blot using protein-specific APRs7. During these exercises, we realized, however, that a minority of aggregation-prone sequences are found within several and sometimes many proteins. By the same mechanistic reasoning, this suggests that a minority of proteins will, when aggregating, induce the aggregation of several and even many other proteins. This also suggests that most proteomes possess proteostatic weaknesses that might constitute hot spots for proteostatic collapse under conditions of stress.",
                "From a small screen of 75 frequently occurring APRs from E. coli, we found that more than half had antibacterial activity at 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL, showing that these APRs are a particularly rich source of APRs that can induce widespread protein aggregation. For several of these peptides, we demonstrated that they indeed enter cells and cause protein aggregation in the form of IBs that contain hundreds of bacterial proteins. Taken together, our findings suggest that redundant APRs (which are a minority of the APRs in the E. coli proteome) indeed represent hot spots for proteostatic collapse, the aggregation of which is so widespread that it is bactericidal. This approach could therefore also represent an interesting paradigm to be explored for the development of a new class of antibiotics."

Thereafter, the anesthetized mice were inoculated UT with 50\u2009\u00b5L of bacterial suspension slowly (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u2009CFU/mL) by the sterile catheter in the bladder over 5\u2009s in order to avoid vesicoureteral reflux through a surgical microscope. We estimated the sample size as follows: allowing a type I error rate of 0.05, a type II error 0.2, and estimating the maximum standard deviation of the CFU determination at 1\u2009log CFU; we calculated that a sample size of 15 would allow us to reliably detect an effect size of 1\u2009log CFU difference between treated and untreated.

Twenty-four hours post infection, mice were sacrificed and organs (kidney, bladder, ureter, colon) were washed with PBS and homogenized (Thermo Savant FastPrep FP120 Homogenizer/24\u2009s).

An interferogram is measured by recording the demodulated detector signal as a function of the position of the reference mirror at a fixed tip position.
