                        "Syngas (which is a short for \u201csynthesis gas\u201d) comprises carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), and is an important source for the production of H2. The conventional industrial process for producing syngas on an industrial scale is steam reforming, whereby a carbonaceous material is reacted with water in the form of steam. Another process, of increasing importance, involves subjecting the carbonaceous material to Catalytic Partial Oxidation. The present invention pertains to a process of this type, referred to hereinafter as \u201cCPO process.\u201d",
                        "A typical CPO process, used for producing H2, a carbonaceous material is subjected to catalytic partial oxidation, after which steam is added and a water gas shift reaction is allowed to take place. In this water gas shift reaction, carbon monoxide reacts with water so as to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The CPO reaction being exothermic, heat is produced. At the outlet temperatures of the CPO a corrosion problem called \u201cmetal dusting.\u201d may appear. Metal dusting is a catastrophic form of corrosion that occurs when susceptible materials are exposed to environments with high carbon activities. The corrosion manifests itself as a break-up of bulk metal to metal powder. This may shorten the life of the equipment involved, and may lead to contamination problems in end-product obtained from such equipment. Metal dusting for any given material tends to occur in a relatively narrow range (100-300\u00b0 C.) of a temperature regime from 400 to 900\u00b0 C. The particular temperature window of susceptibility depends on the material, gas composition, thermodynamic consideration and kinetics. In the case of the typical syngas composition the critical range of temperature is within 450-750\u00b0 C.",
                        "It is believed that the phenomenon of metal dusting in syngas service is caused by the precipitation of carbon into the metals that comprise the material of construction. The mechanism underlying the metal dusting phenomenon is not completely understood, but it is known that the higher concentration of CO in the gas exiting the CPO reactor compared to a steam reforming reactor worsens the metal dusting phenomenon.",
                        "The latter phenomenon particularly occurs downstream of the CPO reactor, where the initial syngas mixture is subjected to cooling prior to the water gas shift reaction. As a result of the cooling, the gas passes the temperature range in which metal dusting is bound to occur. The temperature reduction is generally achieved in a Process Gas Boiler (PGB), which is a heat exchanger designed to quickly reduce the temperature of the process gas to a temperature suitable for the water gas shift reaction. Thus, also the PGB should be protected from metal dusting. A known method to reduce this phenomenon is to design the process gas boiler for a minimum residence time, preferably less than 2 seconds, preferably between 0.25 and 1 seconds, more preferably between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds. However, it is practically difficult to design and operate the PGB for lower residence times because lower residence times lead to very high gas velocities which in turn may increase the material problems incurred.",
                        "WO2010/144544 A1 discloses a method for producing synthesis gas from biomass. The document discloses solar driven refining of biomass and the lowering of the temperature after the reaction to avoid the reverse reaction by various means, for example by indirect heat exchange or by quenching with water. It is disclosed that rapid cooling e.g. between 0.1 and 10 seconds, may reduce the metal dusting phenomenon. There is no disclosure of the particular problems associated with the use of a catalytic partial oxidation reaction followed by a water gas shift (WGS) reaction, i.e. the increased corrosiveness and the need to adjust the S/G ratio before the WGS reaction. A typical temperature of less than 800\u00b0 C. is disclosed as required to prevent the reverse reaction and optimize the amount of syngas.",
                        "It is thus desired to provide a process which is capable of providing syngas and reduce or avoid conditions that could promote the phenomenon of metal dusting."

                        "In a broad sense, the invention is based on the judicious insight that the addition of liquid water is capable of serving a double goal in the field of CPO syngas production. Accordingly, the water contributes to achieving the desired rapid cooling, as well as to enabling the production of a gas mixture having a more desirable composition for the water gas shift reaction.",
                        "It will be understood that the heat exchange that occurs when liquid water is added to the initial synthesis gas mixture, will result in the water to become evaporated, thus adding steam to the gas mixture. The amount of liquid water added is such, that the steam (i.e. H2O in the gas phase) becomes the primary component of the gas mixture. By \u201cprimary\u201d it is meant that the H2O is present in relatively the highest amount.",
                        "The addition of liquid water serves to achieve a fast cooling, that in turn serves to avoid the metal dusting phenomenon which would otherwise occur in the range of 450-750\u00b0 C. Further, the step of adding liquid water does not only provide an elegant way of achieving rapid cooling, it also means that, by adapting the amount of liquid water to be added, one can adapt the total composition of the gas mixture.",
                        "The hydrocarbon material can be a single hydrocarbon, a mixture of hydrocarbons, or any other composition comprising at least one hydrocarbon. Preferred sources are natural gas (CH4), liquid hydrocarbons, for example naphtha or gasoline, gasification of coal, biomass, and waste-to-energy gasification facilities.",
                        "The hydrocarbon material can be in a gaseous (e.g. methane or natural gas) and/or in liquid state and also from biomass; The hydrocarbon material may be suitable for direct feed to the CPO or can be pre-treated for removal of any impurities, such as sulfur compounds, that might be present.",
                        "CPO reactors are known to the skilled person. A CPO reactor generally comprises a reaction zone, made up of a vertical cylindrically shaped steel pressure vessel lined with a refractory material. A CPO reactor typically is distinguished from an autothermal reformer reactors, as the latter comprises a burner, which a CPO generally does not.",
                        "The CPO process results in synthesis gas, or syngas, comprising CO, CO2 and H2.",
                        "The CPO reaction is known to the skilled person. It will generally be carried out in a catalytic partial oxidation reactor, comprising a suitable catalyst bed that serves to catalyze the partial oxidation of hydrocarbon into CO and H2. It will be understood that some complete oxidation product (viz. CO2) may also be formed.",
                        "The term CPO (also often referred to as SCT-CPO) is known to the skilled person. SCT-CPO refers to Short Contact Time Catalytic Partial Oxidation. The CPO reaction takes place in a reactor under the influence of a catalyst at residence times between 10\u22122 to 10\u22124 and with typical catalyst surface contact times around 10\u22126 s\u22121. These contact time correspond to typical space velocities of 100,000 to 250,000 hr\u22121 preferably 100,000 to 200,000 hr\u22121. Catalysts employed for SCT-CPO comprise Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, or Ru. The reaction takes place at catalyst surface temperatures above 950\u00b0 C., preferably above 1000\u00b0 C. By employing said short contact times and high catalyst surface temperatures the formation of CO his highly favoured and the formation of carbon or CO2 is suppressed. This leads to a highly favourable synthesis gas composition. A reference to CPO is (a) L. Basini, Catalysis Today 117 (2006) 384-393. Other references include (b) L. Basini, K. Aasberg-Petersen, A.

                        "According to the invention, the initial synthesis gas resulting from the CPO reaction, is modified by the addition of liquid water. This results in a useful gas mixture comprising the components of the synthesis gas, and additionally H2O as the primary component. The addition of water to the initial syngas mixture is carried out preferably by a direct injection of preheated water into the gas at the outlet of the CPO reactor. By setting the proper operating conditions on the CPO reactor (oxygen/carbon, O2/C, and steam/carbon, S/C, ratios) and the temperature of the heated injected water (typically Boiler Feed Water is used for this purpose), the optimum ratio, S/G, is achieved without any further addition of steam and the proper temperature at the inlet of WGS reactor without the need of installing a Process Gas Boiler (PGB) downstream of the CPO reactor. By adjusting the temperature and/or the amount of the liquid water to be added, the skilled person can relatively simply determine the desired composition and temperature of the synthesis gas mixture obtained. Put simply, at a relatively low water temperature, a lower amount of water will be required to cool the initial synthesis gas, and vice versa. The invention, in one aspect, embodies a quite unexpected phenomenon, viz. that the amount of water required to perform the cooling as well as to adjust the S/G ratio, happens to be in the range that is capable of being adjusted by adjusting the temperature of the preheated water.",
                        "This synthesis gas mixture preferably serves as an intermediate in the production of hydrogen, involving a water gas shift reaction. In that case, it is preferred that the temperature of the initial synthesis gas mixture be reduced (from a typical value such as 950\u00b0 C. to 1050\u00b0 C.) to below 450\u00b0 C., and preferably to below 400\u00b0 C. . The proper temperature of water to be injected downstream the CPO reactor is preferably achieved by using heat from the syngas at the outlet of the water gas shift reactor to preheat the water.",
                        "For the purpose of producing hydrogen, the mixture is subjected to a water gas shift reaction. To this end, the mixture is routed to a water gas shift reactor (WGSR), wherein the gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide and steam is converted to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The WGS reaction is typically carried out using either a single stage or multi stage to attain the desired degree and rate of conversion. In a multi stage process, the high temperature stage (HTS) operates at 300-450\u00b0 C. and typically in the presence of an iron-based catalyst such as Fe/Cr. In the HTS the largest amount of CO is converted, usually more than 90% such as between 96 and 98%. In the following stage, medium or low temperature stage (MTS or LTS), the operating temperature is about 180-280\u00b0 C. and typically a copper/zinc catalyst supported on alumina (Cu/Zn/Al) catalyst is used. In these latter stages the residual CO concentration in the outlet stream is typically as low as 0.1-0.3%.",
                        "The gas stream resulting from the WGSR contains mainly hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Optionally, hydrogen is separated from this stream by pressure swing absorption (PSA) to yield a pure hydrogen stream. Several options exist for further treatment of the gas mixture resulting from the water gas shift reaction. E.g., in order to produce hydrogen, the hydrogen can be separated from the gas mixture. It is also possible to use the method for the express production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.",
                        "In a particular embodiment, the method is used for the production of ammonia and urea. To this end, almost all CO2 is removed from the gas mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide, so as to obtain a gas mixture enriched in H2. The latter is reacted with N2 so as to form ammonia. This reaction is well-known, and the skilled person is familiar with production methods and plants to carry this out. The ammonia is then reacted with the removed CO2 under urea-forming conditions. This reaction too is well-known, and production methods and plants are available to the skilled person. The invention thus provides a very economical way of using the components of the gas mixture obtained, in producing the important bulk chemical compound, urea. The advantage of using the above scheme instead of a conventional steam reforming process is that all CO2 is present in the reaction mixture and as such can be easily removed. In a conventional steam reforming process, only part of the CO2 is present in the reaction mixture, a significant amount of CO2 is present in the flue gas originating from the burning of the fuel needed to supply the heat of reaction.",
                        "The invention further pertains to a plant for the production of hydrogen. In connection with the above-mentioned process embodiments, the plant comprises a catalytic partial oxidation reactor and a water gas shift reactor, downstream of the catalytic partial oxidation reactor. It will be understood that the catalytic partial oxidation reactor may comprise the conventional elements of such a reactor. These comprise, e.g., an inlet for a hydrocarbon feed, a synthesis section comprising a catalytic bed, and an outlet for synthesis gas formed. The water gas shift reactor too, will comprise its conventional elements, such as an inlet for synthesis gas, a reactor chamber, and an outlet for a resulting H2-containing gas stream. In accordance with the invention, an injector for water is placed between the gas outlet of the catalytic partial oxidation reactor and the gas inlet of the water gas shift reactor. The injector may be in the form of a separate quenching unit, comprising a quenching chamber provided with a device to inject water. It may also be provided as an injector into a piping system.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, a heater, typically a heat exchanger, is added to the injector, preferably upstream thereof, so as to preheat the water before it is used.",
