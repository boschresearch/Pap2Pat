    "title": "Structure and antagonism of the receptor complex mediated by human TSLP in allergy and asthma",
    "date": "2017-04-03",
    "abstract": "The pro-inflammatory cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is pivotal to the pathophysiology of widespread allergic diseases mediated by type 2 helper T cell (Th2) responses, including asthma and atopic dermatitis. The emergence of human TSLP as a clinical target against asthma calls for maximally harnessing its therapeutic potential via structural and mechanistic considerations. Here we employ an integrative experimental approach focusing on productive and antagonized TSLP complexes and free cytokine. We reveal how cognate receptor TSLPR allosterically activates TSLP to potentiate the recruitment of the shared interleukin 7 receptor \u03b1-chain (IL-7R\u03b1) by leveraging the flexibility, conformational heterogeneity and electrostatics of the cytokine. We further show that the monoclonal antibody Tezepelumab partly exploits these principles to neutralize TSLP activity. Finally, we introduce a fusion protein comprising a tandem of the TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 extracellular domains, which harnesses the mechanistic intricacies of the TSLP-driven receptor complex to manifest high antagonistic potency.",

                        "Prior studies had suggested that the signalling complex mediated by human TSLP proceeds through an initial binary complex between TSLP and TSLPR to enable recruitment of IL-7R\u03b1 (refs 5, 6, 37). To determine the assembly order and kinetic profile underlying the TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex we performed real time in vitro interaction studies via bio-layer interferometry (BLI) using mammalian-derived glycosylated TSLP, IL-7 and soluble TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). In accordance to prior observations human TSLP could only be produced in HEK293 cells upon abolishing its putative furin cleavage site38. Firstly, we determined that TSLPR binds to TSLP with high-affinity (KD=32\u2009nM) and fast kinetics (ka=1.7 \u00d7 105 \u2009M\u22121\u2009s\u22121 and kd=5.2 \u00d7 10\u22123\u2009s\u22121) (Fig. 1a). In contrast, IL-7R\u03b1, which was able to bind to cognate IL-7 (Supplementary Fig. 1B), showed no apparent binding to TSLP alone (Fig. 1b)39. However, IL-7R\u03b1 associated with preformed TSLP:TSLPR binary complex with high-affinity (KD=29\u2009nM; ka of 1.23 \u00d7 105\u2009M\u22121\u2009s\u22121; kd of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22123\u2009s\u22121) (Fig. 1c). Thus, priming of human TSLP by its cognate receptor, TSLPR, is a mechanistic prerequisite for the recruitment of shared IL-7R\u03b1 to the extracellular ternary complex.",
                        "Such initial mechanistic insights formed the basis for a strategy to biochemically reconstitute the TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex for structural studies. To facilitate the growth of well-diffracting crystals towards structural characterization of the complex at high-resolution by X-ray crystallography, we focused on the production of minimally glycosylated ternary complexes. We thus produced non-glycosylated bioactive human TSLP lacking a basic cassette (127RRKRK131) (ref. 38) and the IL-7R\u03b1 ectodomain via in vitro refolding from inclusion bodies produced in E. coli3740. In parallel, we were able to produce N-glycosylation variants of TSLPR (TSLPRN47Q, TSLPRN47Q/N101Q and TSLPRN47Q/N169Q) in HEK293S-TetR MGAT1\u2212/\u2212 cells4142. Following enzymatic trimming of residual TSLPR glycosylation, ternary TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complexes were assembled and isolated in a sequential manner by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1d,e), and were found to be highly homogeneous (Fig. 1f) and to adopt monodisperse assemblies obeying 1:1:1 stoichiometry as characterized by coupling SEC to multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) (Fig. 1g). Crystallization trials using purified TSLP\u0394127\u2013131:TSLPRN47Q:IL-7R\u03b1 complex lead to optimized crystals that diffracted synchrotron X-rays to 2.55\u2009\u00c5 resolution, and enabled determination of the crystal structure of the human TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex by molecular replacement (Fig. 1h, Table 1)."

                        "Our crystallographic analysis contributes structural insights at high-resolution of human TSLP and TSLPR (Supplementary Fig. 1C) and reveals how TSLP wedges between TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 to mediate a T-shaped extracellular assembly (Fig. 2a), as further supported by small-angle X-ray scattering (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1). TSLP employs two opposing surface patches to interact with the elbow tips of the cytokine-binding homology regions (CHRs) of TSLPR (site I) and IL-7R\u03b1 (site II), which allow the membrane-proximal parts of the two receptors to engage in heterotypic receptor\u2013receptor interactions (site III) (Fig. 2a). TSLP and TSLPR display pronounced electrostatic complementarity spanning the entire site I, with TSLP presenting a positively charged surface patch associating with the negatively charged interdomain elbow of TSLPR (Fig. 2b). This suggests that long-range electrostatic interactions may play an important role in attracting TSLP to TSLPR at the cell surface to establish the mechanistically critical binary complex. Interestingly, electrostatic potential calculations on the TSLP:TSLPR binary complex show that this molecular entity would project a negative electrostatic potential, which would render it compatible with the positive electrostatic potential of unbound IL-7R\u03b1.",
                        "Consistent with annotations of human TSLP as a member of the IL-2 family of cytokines, its mature sequence (residues 29\u2013159) adopts a four-helix bundle with \u2018up-up-down-down' topology stabilized by three disulfide bridges (Cys34-Cys110, Cys69-Cys75 and Cys90-Cys137), in which the four \u03b1-helices\u2014designated \u03b1A, \u03b1B, \u03b1C, \u03b1D\u2014are threaded via a BC loop and two long overhand AB and CD loop regions, with the latter largely invisible in the electron density maps (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 3A). The functional role of the flexible CD loop containing the seven residue basic cassette (residues 125\u2013131) remains enigmatic (Supplementary Fig. 3A). It has been hypothesized that its embedded furin cleavage site is linked to a mechanism limiting the availability of proinflammatory TSLP in vivo43. Moreover, it was recently shown that in nasal polyp tissues this loop region can be proteolytically processed to yield a biologically active nicked form of human TSLP (ref. 44). In addition, the positive charge density may mediate interactions with glycosoaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix, as proposed for IL-7 (ref. 45).",
                        "The structure of human TSLP is unique among helix bundle cytokines in three main ways. First, it adopts a rather open helix bundle core that is perforated by an elongated internal void volume (\u223c120\u2009\u00c53) running from the \u03b1A-\u03b1C face to the \u03b1B-\u03b1C face of the helical bundle (Fig. 2c). Second, it harbours a fully buried structural water at the heart of the helical bundle, coordinated by a conserved trio of amino acids (Trp148, Thr102, Thr83) (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 3A) suggesting that this central water molecule is an integral part of the protein fold. This notion is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TSLP using an explicit solvent model, whereby TSLP devoid of this core water molecule rapidly acquires a new water molecule from solvent through a water channel between helices B and C (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Third, the conspicuously kinked \u03b1A in TSLP, a structural feature shared with IL-7 despite the lack of appreciable levels of sequence identity (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3C), is hallmarked by a \u03c0-helical turn. Interestingly, MD simulations showed that in about 20% of the simulated frames a water molecule inserted into the \u03c0-helical turn of TSLP, seemingly to compensate for the interrupted hydrogen-bonding pattern of the main chain (Supplementary Fig. 3D), reminiscent of water-mediated stabilization of \u03c0-helical turns in diverse proteins46."

                        "The atypical open helical bundle core of TSLP and the intriguing \u03c0-helical turn in helix \u03b1A of TSLP prompted us to hypothesize that the priming of TSLP by TSLPR for recruitment of IL-7R\u03b1 might be linked to the intrinsic plasticity and dynamics of TSLP. To this end, we performed a series of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on isotopically labelled TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 and pursued complementary MD simulations. Assignment of the NMR spectra by triple resonance spectroscopy on isotopically labelled TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 revealed that unbound TSLP comprises the four \u03b1-helices as delineated in the structure of TSLP bound to its receptors (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, 1H\u201315N heteronuclear NOE analysis showed decreased NOE values for the overhand AB and CD loops, as well as for the N- and C-termini, reflecting the relative higher flexibility of these regions compared to the helical parts of the structure47 (Fig. 2f).",
                        "Altogether with the structure of receptor-bound TSLP, these findings provide the rationale for tracing possible structural transitions in TSLP upon complex formation. In particular, TSLP employs the C-terminal half of \u03b1D (residues 142\u2013152), the C-terminal short tail extending from \u03b1D (residues 153\u2013158) and a continuous stretch of 10 residues located in the long overhand AB-loop region (residues 60\u201369) to interact with a complementary interaction epitope formed at the elbow tip of the CHR-module of TSLPR (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 2). On the basis of our NMR studies, the AB-loop and C-terminal tail would undergo significant conformational changes to achieve their observed bound state. This is additionally supported by extensive MD simulations for TSLP and TSLP:TSLPR (Fig. 2g,h), and might have profound mechanistic implications. This is because the AB loop provides a physical link to \u03b1A, which in turn is central to defining site II and the interactions of TSLP with IL-7R\u03b1 (Fig. 2a). Thus, our findings point to the possible role of the AB loop as a structural liaison between the two receptor binding sites on TSLPR (sites I and II) poised to relay a binding event to TSLPR at site I to prime TSLP for the cooperative recruitment of IL-7R\u03b1 at site II.",
                        "Our NMR analysis show that among all residues defining the four \u03b1-helices of TSLP, Thr46 and Ile47 in the \u03c0-helical turn midway \u03b1A exhibit the highest degree of flexibility in unbound TSLP (Fig. 2f), yet they become well-ordered at the TSLP:IL-7R\u03b1 interface. We therefore wondered about the origin of the structural features of the atypical \u03b1A of TSLP and about its possible role in IL-7R\u03b1 recruitment. Indeed, analysis of the NOE strips through each of the resonances of residues in \u03b1A showed that the relative intensity of the amide-amide proton cross peak compared to the diagonal peak is 15\u201325% for all amide proton pairs, except for the Thr46 HN\u2014Ile47 HN NOE where the normalized cross peak rises to 54% (Supplementary Fig. 3E). This discrepancy agrees with the distances between consecutive amide protons in \u03b1A in the bound state of TSLP, which measure at the expected 2.7\u00b10.1\u2009\u00c5 throughout \u03b1A, except for the helical kink region, where the Thr46 HN\u2014Ile47 HN distance shortens to 2.1 \u00c5, while the adjacent Ile47 HN-Ser48 HN distance increases to 2.9\u2009\u00c5. Thus, unbound TSLP in solution also displays the kinked \u03b1A and associated \u03c0-helical turn character before engaging to TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1. The mechanistic ramifications of this deduction are large. In the context of a TSLP helical bundle core that is not densely packed, the TSLP:TSLPR binary complex might facilitate positioning of \u03b1A relayed by the AB loop and the tethering of \u03b1A via Leu44 to TSLPR. This can be expected to provide an entropic advantage for recruiting IL-7R\u03b1 to the ternary complex."

The membrane-distal TSLPRD1 domain is characterized by a ABED/C\u2032CFG topology stabilized by a Cys71-Cys84 disulfide bridge, while the membrane-proximal TSLPRD2 domain displays a ABE/C\u2032CFG topology with two disulfide bridges Cys138-Cys168 and Cys180-Cys218 (Fig. 2a). The latter tethers Cys218 in the loop region extending from strand G2 in TSLPRD2 towards the transmembrane helix of TSLPR with Cys180 located in strand F2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Intriguingly, TSLPR carries a solvent-accessible cysteine residue at position 208 in close proximity to disulfide bridge Cys180-Cys218. Although the role of this unusual triangle of cysteine residues is currently unknown, and while surface-exposed cysteines are rarely observed in receptor ectodomains, disulfide-mediated linkage of TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 in the context of somatic mutations in the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains has been connected to the pathophysiology of B-ALL and T-ALL (refs 48, 49).",

Altogether, the human TSLP cytokine-receptor interface has a pronounced polar footprint and allows us to trace the species-specificity of the TSLP:TSLPR interaction37 (Supplementary Figs 3A and 5), providing a potentially key resource towards interrogating human TSLP activity in mouse models.",
                        "We subsequently leveraged such detailed structural information to identify functional hotspots at the TSLP:TSLPR interface (Fig. 3a) via cellular studies in vitro including a STAT5 activation assay (Supplementary Table 3). Even though human TSLP has been linked to a number of JAK-STAT signalling pathways, STAT5 activation by TSLP has emerged as a signalling prerequisite for Th2 responses mediated by TSLP (refs 4, 50). In a competition-based cellular TSLPR-binding assay employing wild type TSLP fused to secreted alkaline phosphatase (TSLP-SEAP) we first identified a set of TSLP mutants that failed to displace TSLP-SEAP from TSLPR (Fig. 3b). These TSLP mutants probed the importance of the triplet of arginine residues near the C-terminal region of TSLP at the TSLP:TSLPR interface (Arg149, Arg150 and Arg153) (Fig. 3a). In TSLP-induced STAT5 activity assays these TSLP mutants were still able to induce STAT5 activation, albeit with half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values lowered by 1\u20133 orders of magnitude as compared with WT (EC50=0.15\u2009pM). The TSLP-Arg149Ser/Arg150Ser double mutant had the most pronounced effect (EC50=100\u2009pM) (Fig. 3c). To probe the importance of TSLPR site I interface residues we performed STAT5-based cellular activity assays with a set of TSLPR variants (Supplementary Table 3). Here, TSLPR-Asp92Ala, TSLPR-Trp112Ala and TSLPR-Trp112Arg displayed a greater than 1,000-fold reduced EC50-value as compared to wild type (Fig. 3d). The apparent essential roles of TSLPR-Asp92 and TSLPR-Trp112 in TSLP recruitment are borne by our structural observations. TSLPR-Asp92 pairs via a bifurcated hydrogen-bond with TSLP-Arg153 and TSLP-Arg150, while Trp112 packs between \u03b1D and the AB loop of TSLP (Fig. 3a)."

Our structural studies reveal that IL-7R\u03b1 employs a hydrophobic platform contributed by several residues in IL-7R\u03b1D1 (Val78, Leu100, Ile102) and IL-7R\u03b1D2 (Tyr159, Tyr212, Phe213) to clamp onto the AC-face of the TSLP helical bundle as defined by residues protruding from \u03b1A of TSLP (Ala41, Ala42, Leu44, Ser45, Thr46, Leu47, Lys49) and \u03b1C (Met97, Met100, Lys101, Ala104, Ala105, Ile108 and Trp109) (Figs 2a and 3e; Supplementary Table 2).

While our selected set of single site TSLP mutants had no apparent effect, we found that a double TSLP mutant carrying Ser45Arg/Thr46Arg mutations at the \u03c0-helical turn of \u03b1A (Fig. 3f) showed reduced capacity in inducing TSLPR/IL-7R\u03b1-mediated STAT5-signalling (EC50=5.3\u2009pM versus for IC50,WT=0.11\u2009pM), while the affinity towards TSLPR remained largely unaffected (IC50=720\u2009pM versus IC50,WT=320\u2009pM) (Fig. 3g). At site II, mutations in the hydrophobic EF loop region of IL-7R\u03b1D1 (Leu100Ser/Ile102Ser, EC50=470\u2009pM) also led to a decreased signalling potential (EC50=85\u2009pM) (Fig. 3d).",

Although IL-7 and TSLP exhibit marginal sequence similarity (Supplementary Fig. 3C), IL-7R\u03b1 employs a near identical set of residues to interact with IL-7 and TSLP, burying 740\u2009\u00c52 and 630\u2009\u00c52 of solvent-accessible surface, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6C,D).

                        "To compare the binding properties of our TSLP-traps to Tezepelumab (AMG-157/MEDI9929) (ref. 54), to our knowledge the most potent anti-TSLP antagonist to date, we produced AMG-157 and its Fab fragment in HEK293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 8A,B). AMG-157 is a fully human neutralizing immunoglobulin G subclass 2 (IgG2) anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody (mAb) and was recently shown to alleviate most measures of both early and late asthmatic responses in patients with mild allergic asthma36. AMG-157Fab displays comparable affinity and binding kinetics to TSLP when compared to TSLP-trap1 (Fig. 5e). However, cellular activity assays in HEK293T cells at 10\u2009pM TSLP (EC50=9\u2009pM) demonstrated that TSLP-trap1 and TSLP-trap2 are 20\u201330 fold more potent in inhibiting TSLP-induced STAT5 signalling (IC50=67 and 44\u2009pM, respectively) (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. 7B) compared to AMG-157 mAb and its Fab fragment (IC50=1.4 and 1.7\u2009nM, respectively) (Fig. 5f). Remarkably, the TSLP-traps show about 1,000-fold higher inhibitory potency over equimolar mixtures of unlinked TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 (IC50=49\u2009nM) (Fig. 5g), suggesting that fusion of the two receptor ectodomains harnesses certain key mechanistic features underlying the TSLP-receptor complex. Parallel assays at 100\u2009pM TSLP resulted in analogous observations but with overall higher IC50-values (Supplementary Fig. 7C). Finally, neither TSLP-trap1 nor TSLP-trap2 inhibited STAT5 signalling in HEK293T cells transfected with IL-7R\u03b1 and the common gamma-chain (\u03b3c) mediated by IL-7 at 10 and 100\u2009pM (EC50=41\u2009pM) (Fig. 5h; Supplementary Fig. 7D,E).",
                        "To evaluate the potential of TSLP-traps to block TSLP-driven dendritic cell activation we quantified HLA-DR, CD40 and CD80 cell-surface expression levels and CCL17 chemokine production by primary human CD1c+ blood dendritic cells treated with TSLP alone336 or in combination with antagonists (Fig. 6a,b). These experiments show that both TSLP-trap1 and TSLP-trap2 are able to significantly inhibit TSLP-driven DC activation, and that they are as potent in this regard as AMG-157."

                        "We seized the opportunity to obtain structural and mechanistic insights into how Tezepelumab (AMG-157) might exert its antagonistic effects on TSLP and to characterize TSLP in a binary complex with a non-signalling binding partner, by pursuing the crystal structure of TSLP in complex with AMG-157Fab. We were able to biochemically reconstitute and crystallize the TSLP\u0394127\u2013131:AMG-157Fab complex and to determine its crystal structure to 2.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 7a; Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 8D). The structure reveals that the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable heavy chain domain (VH) of AMG-157 target TSLP at the AB-loop region and C-terminal region of helix D, while the variable light chain fragment does not interact with TSLP at all (Fig. 7a). The TSLP:AMG-157 interface buries a total of 1,200\u2009\u00c52 of accessible surface area, with all three VH-CDR loops contributing to a polar footprint (Fig. 7b; Supplementary Table 4). Most notably, Glu110 in the CDR-3 loop makes a bifurcated salt-bridge with TSLP-Arg150 and TSLP-Arg153, and Trp105 packs against TSLP-Cys75 in a surface pocket formed between TSLP \u03b1D and the overhand AB-loop (Fig. 7b). Importantly, we now show that AMG-157 competes against a critical part of the TSLPR binding site on TSLP and remains completely clear of the IL-7R\u03b1 binding site on the other side of the TSLP helical bundle (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, structural superposition of TSLP in its two complexes shows that the AB-loop and C-terminal tail extending from \u03b1D adopt different conformations, with the rest of the TSLP main chain being very similar (r.m.s.d. of 0.56\u2009\u00c5 for 89 aligned C\u03b1 atoms). In fact the AB-loop and the C-terminal tail of \u03b1D in the TSLP:AMG-157 complex are only partly resolved in the electron density maps, indicating that these regions are flexible in the absence of TSLPR consistent with our NMR and MD studies of TSLP (Figs 2f and 7d)."

                        "The TSLP:AMG-157 complex provides a unique view of the IL-7R\u03b1 binding site on TSLP in the absence of the shared receptor, thereby fuelling insights into the possible structural transitions associated with the cooperative recruitment of IL-7R\u03b1 to the TSLP-mediated signalling complex. Perhaps the most intriguing feature of TSLP as bound to AMG-157 concerns an ordered water molecule that inserts into the \u03c0-helical turn of helix \u03b1A in TSLP to provide a hydrogen-bonded bridge between the main-chain carbonyl and amide groups of Tyr43 and Lys49 (Fig. 7e). Such compensatory structural feature against the local disruption of the helix hydrogen bonding network has been linked to the stabilization of \u03c0-helical elements4655. In accommodating the observed water molecule, the \u03c0-helical turn in \u03b1A in the TSLP:AMG-157 complex is wider by about 1.5\u2009\u00c5 than in the TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex (Fig. 7e). Thus, the \u03c0-helical turn in \u03b1A is able to adopt at least two distinct conformational states. Given the localization of this part of \u03b1A at the crossroads of the TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex (Fig. 2a) and its contribution to the IL-7R\u03b1 binding epitope (Fig. 3e), we propose that the observed structural plasticity at the \u03c0-helical turn in \u03b1A may be a key feature in the structural priming of the cytokine by TSLPR to enable high-affinity binding by IL-7R\u03b1. In support of this notion and the functional role of receptor\u2013receptor interactions in the ternary complex, IL-7R\u03b1 cannot be recruited to the TSLP:AMG-157 complex (Supplementary Fig. 8C).",
                        "Additional insights into the possible structural states of TSLP are provided by our NMR analysis. Close inspection of the 1H,15N HSQC TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 NMR spectrum at 900 MHz uncovered conformational heterogeneity on the second time-scale, which is much slower than can be sampled by MD-simulations. Specifically, we identified two populations for the Tyr43-Leu44-Ser45-Thr46 amide resonances located in the \u03c0-helical turn in \u03b1A of TSLP, as well as for the side-chain resonance of Trp148, which stacks right above the \u03c0-helical turn of TSLP (Fig. 7f; Supplementary Fig. 9A\u2013E). The minor conformations observed for Ser45 and Trp148 are populated to 20\u00b12% based on deconvoluted integrals of their respective signals, suggesting that they represent the same structural heterogeneity that connects the core of TSLP to \u03b1A. Although our NMR analysis does not provide structural details for the two TSLP conformations, together with the distinct conformational states of active versus antagonized TSLP, it provides independent support for the structural heterogeneity of TSLP."

                "The emergence of TSLP as a central orchestrator of Th2 responses that initiate allergy and inflammation has placed therapeutic targeting of TSLP-mediated signalling against major chronic diseases such as allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis at center stage. However, in order to maximally harness the therapeutic potential of TSLP-mediated signalling, it will be essential to dissect the structural and mechanistic basis for its bioactivity. Recent efforts that have leveraged mechanistic and structure-based considerations of cytokine-mediated receptor activation, have led to the development of engineered IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 variants with drastically improved therapeutic efficacy and specificity, illustrating the power of consolidating such approaches in the development of tailor-made biologics565758. In this study we have employed an integrative approach, including structural data at high-resolution, to propose a mechanistic blueprint for the activation and antagonism of the pro-inflammatory complex mediated by human TSLP.",
                "The cornerstone of our mechanistic proposal is the high-affinity TSLP:TSLPR encounter complex driven by long-range electrostatic attraction of TSLP to its specific receptor at the cell surface, that primes two key concerted structural events: (i) allosteric activation of TSLP at site II by restructuring of its epicentre at the \u03c0-helical turn of \u03b1A relayed by the structuring of the AB loop to enable recruitment of the shared receptor IL-7R\u03b1 and (ii) positioning of the TSLPR membrane-proximal domain to facilitate interactions with the corresponding extracellular domain of IL-7R\u03b1 (Fig. 8). The latter is potentially facilitated in part by the intrinsic, albeit low, affinity of the two receptors for each other, and partly by electrostatic attraction of IL-7R\u03b1 to the TSLP:TSLPR binary complex, consistent with mechanistic implementation seen in diverse families of cytokine receptors585960.",
                "The intrinsic cooperativity of the TSLP:TSLPR:IL-7R\u03b1 complex is also the mechanistic pillar for the high in vitro potency of the TSLP-traps we have developed by linking the TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 ectodomains to create a single protein. Our TSLP-trap fusion proteins neutralize TSLP via a very drastic improvement in the KD compared to the unlinked counterparts by nearly three orders of magnitude (KD=120\u2009pM) manifested primarily by very slow off-rate kinetics (t1/2\u223c10\u2009h). This strong increase in binding affinity is functionally reflected by the potent antagonistic activity and specificity of the TSLP-traps against TSLP signalling in our cellular inhibition assays with IC50-values below 100\u2009pM (Fig. 5). Such binding properties gain important biological context in light of the ability of both TSLP-trap1 and TSLP-trap2 to effectively antagonize TSLP-mediated molecular responses relevant for Th2 immunity in human primary cells (Fig. 6). Remarkably, the IC50-values obtained for the TSLP-traps are 20\u201340-fold lower than those obtained for the AMG-157 mAb and its derived Fab fragment, which we propose is inextricably linked to the mechanistic modalities of the TSLP-mediated receptor complex (Fig. 8). Fusion proteins comprising receptor ectodomains and decoy receptors foster attractive binding properties to serve as effective therapeutics61, as exemplified in the targeting of IL-1 (Rilonacept) or TNF\u03b1 (Etanercept) for the treatment of CAPS-syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively62. Indeed, we are currently performing in vivo studies to assess the antagonistic potency of such fusion proteins. Furthermore, we anticipate that the current version of the TSLP-traps can be additionally improved in a number of ways, including optimizing linker length and introducing mutations to enhance the affinity and/or cross-linkage of the TSLPR and IL-7R\u03b1 ectodomains to each other. Indeed, the therapeutic potential of targeting TSLP to treat allergic diseases mediated by Th2 responses is large, in particular in the context of combined approaches co-targeting the bioactivity of IL-25 and IL-33 (ref. 35).",
                "Finally, our work on human TSLP provides opportunities to further investigate recent intriguing findings describing a second isoform of TSLP, termed short form TSLP (sfTSLP)636465. Evidence for sfTSLP mainly pertains to the transcriptional levels of sfTSLP, and led to proposals that sfTSLP might be the constitutively expressed isoform of TSLP. sfTSLP is 63 residues in length and approximately covers the C-terminal half of human TSLP (residues 97\u2013159). On our structure of human TSLP, sfTSLP would encompass \u03b1C, the long CD loop and \u03b1D (Supplementary Fig. 3A). It is presently unclear if sfTSLP can adopt any helical structure in the absence of \u03b1A and \u03b1B. However, a propensity to form amphipathic helices combined with a high isoelectric point (pI) of 11.1 would support its presumed function as antimicrobial peptide6366. sfTSLP may also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties6465 and may mediate immune tolerance in the gut67.",
                "We envisage that the structural and mechanistic framework and the molecular tools presented here will facilitate targeted interrogation of TSLP signalling in vitro and in animal models, and will guide therapeutic approaches that manipulate human TSLP-mediated signalling to treat allergic diseases."

The PCR fragments were cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI opened pEF6-myc/HisA expression vector in frame with a C-terminal myc/hexahistidine tag, resulting in pEF-ShTSLPR and pEF-ShIL7R\u03b1. Human TSLP-trap1 (pEF-hTSLPtrap1) was generated by PCR amplification of a (GGS)20-linker fragment from a plasmid template (primer pair 11\u201312) and the extracellular part of the human IL-7R\u03b1 (residues 21\u2013239) with the C-terminal myc/His tag from pEF-ShIL7R\u03b1 with primer pair 13\u201314 (Supplementary Table 5). Both fragments were ligated in frame by a 3-point ligation into the XbaI/PmeI opened pEF-ShTSLPR vector. In the resulting fusion construct the human IL-7R\u03b1 extracellular domain with C-terminal myc/His tag is connected by the (GGS)20-linker fragment to the C-terminus of the human soluble TSLPR. Human TSLP-trap2 (pEF-hTSLPtrap2) was generated likewise by ligating the same linker fragment together with that encoding the extracellular domain of human TSLPR (residues 23\u2013231 and C-terminal myc/His tag, PCR amplified from pEF-ShTSLPR with primer pair 14\u201315) into the XbaI/PmeI opened pEF-ShIL7R\u03b1 vector (Supplementary Table 5). Finally, the natural signal sequence of hIL7R\u03b1 was replaced by subcloning the open reading frame of hTSLPtrap2 (starting with residue E21 of the mature hIL7R\u03b1 sequence) by PCR-cloning (primer pair 16\u201317) (Supplementary Table 5) into EcoRI/PmeI of pEF6-ssFlag which contains the signal sequence of the murine IL-33R\u03b1 followed by a Flag-tag. The final expression vectors were generated by cloning the cDNA-fragments encoding TSLP-trap1 and TSLP-trap2 into the multicloning site of the the pcDNA4/TO-expression vector (Thermofisher) in frame with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag using primer pairs 18\u201319 and 20\u201321 (Supplementary Table 5). For TSLP-trap1, the native secretion signal of human TSLPR was used, while for TSLP-trap2 the signal peptide from the pHLsec-vector was used68.

Isotopically labelled TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 was refolded from inclusion bodies and its N-terminal His-tag was removed as described above. Protein samples for NMR measurements at concentrations of 582\u2009\u03bcM (8.5\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121) for 15N-TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 and 628\u2009\u03bcM (9.2\u2009mg\u2009ml\u22121) for 13C/15N-TSLP\u0394127\u2013131 were prepared in 20\u2009mM NaH2PO4 pH 6.8, 50\u2009mM NaCl, 2.5\u2009mM EDTA and 1 \u00d7 cOmplete Protease Inhibitor cocktail. NMR spectra were recorded on 600\u2009MHz Bruker and 900\u2009MHz US2 Bruker NMR spectrometer instruments at the CNRS Structural and Functional Glycobiology Unit (Parc Scientifique de la Haute Borne, Lille, France) and assignment of the triple resonance NMR spectra of TSLP was obtained by the product-plane approach78. Assignment of the tryptophan side chains was based on the NOE contact between the tryptophan amide resonance previously assigned by triple resonance spectroscopy and the H\u03b4 side chain proton of tryptophan."

                        "TSLP conformational plasticity. The conformational plasticity of TSLP and TSLP bound to TSLPR was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. As X-ray structures for TSLP do not provide any density in the loop region spanning from residues 115\u2013132, fifty models were generated for this region using Modeller 9.14 (ref. 79). To account for the structural heterogeneity of this loop, five diverse loop models were selected for molecular dynamics simulations. The apo-TSLP structures and TSLP:TSLPR complex structures were prepared separately. Five 250\u2009ns molecular dynamics simulations, each with a different TSLP starting model, were performed for TSLP and TSLP:TSLPR (10 runs in total). All simulations were performed using Gromacs 5.1.1 (ref. 80) with the Amber99SB-ILDN force field and TIP3P explicit solvent. The crystal structure was placed in a rhombic dodecahedron extending 1.2\u2009nm beyond the diameter of the system. An integration time step of 2\u2009fs and the Verlet scheme were used for all simulations. Van der Waals and short-range Coulomb forces were truncated to 10\u2009\u00c5. Long-range Coulomb forces were treated with the particle mesh Ewald method and bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained. During equilibration, protein heavy atoms were harmonically restrained with a force constant of 1,000\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121\u2009nm\u22121. The crystal structure was relaxed using a steepest descent algorithm until the maximum force exerted on any atom was lower than 1,000\u2009kJ\u2009mol\u22121. A 300\u2009ps NVT equilibration was then performed, starting at 30\u2009K and increasing the temperature to 300\u2009K over the course of 200\u2009ps. Temperature control was achieved through two Bussi\u2013Parinello thermostats coupled to protein and non-protein groups, each with a coupling time of 0.1\u2009ps. Following NVT equilibration the system was coupled to a Berendsen barostat with a reference pressure of 1 bar and a coupling time of 0.5\u2009ps for 500\u2009ps of NPT equilibration. The 250\u2009ns long production runs were performed using two Nose\u2013Hoover thermostats with coupling times of 1\u2009ps and reference temperatures of 300\u2009K. Pressure control was achieved through a Parinello-Rahman barostat with a reference pressure of 1 bar and a coupling time of 2\u2009ps. Snapshots were saved every 100\u2009ps. Root-mean-square fluctuations around the average structure were calculated for the final 100\u2009ns of simulation time.",
                        "Water-stripped TSLP. An interesting feature of the TSLP crystal structure is the presence of a buried water molecule in the core. During the MD simulations described above, the buried water molecule remained bound in the protein core. To assess its structural role further, molecular dynamics simulations were performed in which the central water molecule was deleted from the starting model. Three 250\u2009ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were completed. Spontaneous rehydration of this cavity through a channel located between the B and C helices by bulk water molecules was observed within 15\u2013125\u2009ns in each of three independent simulations.",

We sought to investigate if water molecules were present at a similar position in our simulations by identifying water molecules for which the distance between the water oxygen, and the Tyr43 carbonyl oxygen and the Lys49 amide nitrogen was equal to or less than 3.5\u2009\u00c5. Such water molecules were identified in 19% of frames over the entire TSLP simulations."
