                        "During normal aging the brain undergoes many changes resulting in a gradual but detectable cognitive decline that is associated with limited neuronal loss and glial proliferation in the cortex and gross weight decrease of 2-3% per decade (Drachman, D. A., 2006, Neurology, 67: 1340-1352; Yankner, B. A., et al., 2008, Annu. Rev. Pathol., 3:41-66). On the molecular level the mechanisms driving aging of the brain are not yet understood, but likely include mitochondrial DNA damage (Lu, T., et al., 2004, Nature 429:883-891) and chronic oxidative stress (Lin, M. T., et al., 2006, Nature 443:787-795). This slow decline in cognitive ability does not interfere with normal function through at least 100 years of life. In contrast Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with a rapid cognitive decline with an average survival of 5-10 years after the diagnosis (Blennow, K., et al., 2006, Lancet, 368:387-403); Cummings, J. L., 2004, N. Engl. J. Med., 351:56-67; Jakob-Roetne, R. and Jacobsen, H., 2009, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 48:3030-3059). Age is the main AD risk factor with almost half of the population over age 85 affected. However, AD clearly differs from the normal aging in that it causes dramatic loss of synapses, neurons and brain activity in specific anatomical regions, and results in massive atrophy and gliosis (Drachman, D. A., 2006; Herrup, K., 2010, J. Neurosci., 30:16755-16762).",
                        "The factors that cause some individuals to depart from the relatively benign process of normal brain aging and instead undergo the pathological cascade that leads to AD are unknown. A number of genetic risk factors for AD have been proposed (Waring, S. C. and Rosenberg, R. N., 2008, Arch. Neurol., 65:329-334; Bertram, L. and Tanzi, R. E., 2008, Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 9:768-778; Harold, D., et al., 2009, Nat. Genet., 41:1088-1093; Lambert, J. C., et al., 2009, Nat. Genet., 41:1094-1099), however, only the apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54-allele, which lowers the age of onset and accelerates the cognitive decline, has a large effect (Kleiman, T., et al., 2006, Dement. Geriatr. Cogn. Disord., 22:73-82; Stone, D. J., et al., 2010, Pharmacogenomics J., 10:161-164). Pathologically, AD is characterized by the presence of two insoluble protein aggregates, senile plaques formed from the peptide \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Goedert, M. and Spillantini, M. G., 2006, Science, 314:777-781). In rare familial AD, the cause of disease is autosomal dominant mutations in A\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) or the A\u03b2-producing enzymes presenilins (PSEN1 or PSEN2), which are all thought to lead to increased levels of aggregated A\u03b2 (Waring, S. C. and Rosenberg, R. N., 2008; Bertram, L. and Tanzi, R. E., 2008; Hardy, J. and Selkoe, D. J., 2002, Science, 297:353-356). Likewise, mutations in tau (MAPT) that predispose it to aggregation can cause specific diseases that involve profound neurodegeneration and dementia (Ballatore, C., et al., 2007, Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 8:663-672; Wolfe, M. S., 2009, J. Biol. Chem., 284: 6021-6025). Thus, like in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease, the formation of toxic insoluble aggregates seems to be a key pathogenic step. It is not known why these A\u03b2 and tau aggregates accumulate in AD patients, nor how they contribute to neuronal dysfunction, particularly as to A\u03b2 deposits, which can often be found in the brains of elderly non-demented subjects (Schmitt, F. A., et al., 2000, Neurology, 55:370-376).",
                        "An important goal of AD research is to identify interventions that maintain brain function, potentially by inhibiting the formation or improving the clearance of neurotoxic aggregates, or by promoting resistance to or recovery from damage. A number of biological processes have been associated with AD including cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and response to misfolded proteins, such as increased expression of heat shock proteins. The link with lipid metabolism is supported, for example, by the essential role of APOE in lipid transport in the brain (Kleiman, T., et al., 2006; Stone, D. J., et al., 2010). These processes have not been unequivocally ordered into a pathogenic cascade and the molecular mediators and correlates of each are largely unknown.",
                        "Microarray gene expression profiling provides an opportunity to observe processes that are common for normal aging, AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to detect the differences between these conditions and disentangle their relationships. Towards that end, Applicants profiled post-mortem samples from non-demented and AD subjects and used gene co-expression network analysis to distinguish several major processes involved in brain aging and disease and to define the corresponding signature scores quantitatively. The invention herein is directed to biomarkers correlated to the underlying pathology, signature scores that can be used to monitor disease progression and to develop animal models for the study of disease pathology and the evaluation of therapeutics for the treatment of AD."

BioAge captures the first principal component of variation and includes genes statistically associated with neuronal loss, glial activation, and lipid metabolism. BioAge typically increases with chronological age, but in AD it is prematurely expressed, as if, the subjects were 140 years old. A component of BioAge, Lipa, contains the AD risk factor APOE and reflects an apparent early disturbance in lipid metabolism. The rate of biological aging in AD patients, which was not explained by the BioAge, was instead associated with NdStress, which included genes related to protein folding and metabolism. Inflame, comprised of inflammatory cytokines and microglial genes, was broadly activated and appeared early in the disease process. In contrast, the disease specific Alz biomarker was selectively present only in the affected areas of the AD brain, appeared later in pathogenesis, and was enriched in genes associated with the signaling and cell adhesion changes during the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition.",

Amyloid deposits comprise a peptide, referred to as amyloid beta peptide, that aggregates to form an insoluble mass. Disease characterized by amyloid deposits include, but are not limited to Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or other forms of memory loss or dementia.",

                                "As used herein, the term \u201cbiomarker\u201d refers to a list of genes known to be associated or correlated for which the gene expression in a particular tissue can be measured. The gene expression values for the correlated genes making up the biomarker can be used to calculate the signature score (Score) for the biomarker.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cgene signature\u201d or \u201csignature score\u201d or \u201cScore\u201d refers to a set of one or more differentially expressed genes that are statistically significant and characteristic of the biological differences between two or more cell samples, e.g., normal, non-demented and AD cells, cell samples from different cell types or tissue, or cells exposed to an agent or not. A signature may be expressed as a number of individual unique probes complementary to signature genes whose expression is detected when a cRNA product is used in microarray analysis or in a PCT reaction. A signature may be exemplified by a particular set of genes making up a biomarker. One means to calculate a signature or Score is provided in Example 4, in which the Score is equivalent to the average gene expression of the up-regulated genes minus the average gene expression for the down-regulated genes.",
                                "As used herein, the term \u201cmeasuring expression levels,\u201d or \u201cobtaining expression level,\u201d \u201cdetecting an expression level\u201d and the like refers to methods that quantify a gene expression level of, for example, a transcript of a gene or a protein encoded by a gene, as well as methods that determine whether a gene or interest is expressed at all. Thus, an assay which provides a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d result without necessarily providing quantification of an amount of expression is an assay that \u201cmeasures expression\u201d as that term is used herein. Alternatively, a measured or obtained expression level may be expressed as any quantitative value, for example, a fold-change in expression, up or down, relative to a control gene or relative to the same gene in another sample, or a log ratio of expression, or any visual representation thereof, such as, for example a \u201cheatmap\u201d where a color intensity is representative of the amount of gene expression detected. Exemplary methods for detecting the level of expression of a gene include, but are not limited to, Northern blotting, dot or slot blots, reporter gene matrix (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,588) nuclease protection, RT-PCR, microarray profiling, differential display, 2D gel electrophoresis, SELDI-TOF, ICAT, enzyme4 assay, antibody assay, and the like.",

                                "To identify gene expression changes corresponding to AD, we analyzed RNA specimens from more than 600 individuals with pathologically confirmed diagnoses of AD, Huntington's disease (HD), or age-matched controls (average post-mortem interval of 18 hours) using microarrays with over 40,000 unique probes. The brain regions profiled included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), visual cortex (VC), and cerebellum (CR). These regions were chosen in part because, in AD, the PFC is impacted by the pathology while the latter two regions remain largely intact throughout most of the disease (Braak, H. and Braak, E., 1991, Acta. Neuropathol., 82: 239-259). The data were then analyzed by principal component analysis to assess the major patterns of gene expression variability. Genes that were highly correlated with the principal components were used to build signatures and biologically annotate the major sources of variance.",
                                "Analysis of differential gene expression in prefrontal cortex between non-demented individuals and AD patients revealed massive changes, with more than 18,000 transcripts significantly regulated (ANOVA p<10\u22126) by more than 28% (FIGS. 8A-8C). Much of this differential expression was due to a single gene expression pattern that defined the first principal component (PC1) in both AD and normal samples. PC1 explained 45% of the variance in the up-regulated genes and 60% of the variance in the down-regulated genes. As shown in the heat map in FIG. 1, AD and normal subjects dominated the opposite ends of this gene expression pattern, with some subjects from each group in the intermediate range. When normal and AD subjects were considered separately, it was largely the same genes that contributed to the PC1 pattern in both the AD and normal subjects, as shown by correlation analysis in FIGS. 8A-8C. This indicated that the same major biological process, as reflected in the gene expression, started in normal brains and continued developing in AD brains. Applicants found a significant correlation of PC1 with chronological age in non-demented individuals (\u03c1=0.58, p=9E-13), but not in AD patients (\u03c1=0.10, p=0.17), and concluded that this gene expression pattern captures normal aging processes in prefrontal cortex.",
                                "Tables 1-7 that follow show representative correlated genes that make up each biomarker and the average expression of which was used to calculate the biomarker score, i.e. the signature score. Tables 2 and 3 show the representative genes that were most up- (+BioAge) and down-regulated (-BioAge) with the biomarker, BioAge, and that were selected based on the strongest absolute correlations with PC 1.",
                                "It is useful to ascribe a signature score based on the average expression levels for all included genes as a composite measure of the signature. Applicants refer to the PC1 signature score herein as BioAge (biological age). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants believe that the BioAge signature score (herein the \u201cScore\u201d) of each brain tissue sample is a more precise and objective measure of its aging level than chronological age. Most of the AD subjects attained much larger values for BioAge than normal subjects (AUROC=0.92). Comparison of the Score for BioAge for AD and non-demented individuals at different chronological age groups revealed a very significant difference at younger ages, which decreased in chronologically older age groups. While the Score for BioAge of non-demented individuals gradually increased with age, AD patients showed consistently higher Scores for BioAge regardless of chronological age (FIG. 2A). The extrapolated Scores for normal subjects would reach the average AD Score at a chronological age of 100 years. The most advanced AD brains had Scores for BioAge corresponding to an extrapolated chronological age of 140 years in normal subjects.",
                                "As an independent test of the power of BioAge, that is, the average gene expression or Score for this biomarker, to predict normal chronological age, Applicants applied this biomarker to a cohort of prefrontal cortex samples from non-demented individuals (Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, GSE1572) that were used to qualitatively describe aging in an earlier study (Lu, T., et al., 2004, Nature, 429: 883-891). The BioAge Score in these samples strongly and significantly correlated with the chronological age of the subjects (\u03c1=0.75, p=8E-7, FIG. 2B). In addition, BioAge corresponded to the second principal component in the GSE 1572 dataset (\u03c1=0.90, p=4E-11), validating that aging was a major reproducible source of variance in gene expression in PFC. Prediction of chronological age using gene expression was recently proposed in the literature, Cao, K., et al., 2010, PLoS One, 5: e13098).",
                                "The massive gene expression changes associated with aging that Applicants detected involved a constellation of biological processes. Gene set annotation analysis revealed that the genes down-regulated with increasing BioAge showed significant enrichment for neuronal and synaptic processes, possibly reflecting neuronal depletion or loss of plasticity (data not shown). The up-regulated processes include lipid metabolism, FAK signaling and axon guidance, as well as the glial marker, GFAP (Table 2). In agreement with an earlier analysis of aging signatures observed in normal brains (Yanker, B. A., et al., 2004, Nature, 429:883-891; Lu, T., et al., 2004), the up-regulated genes contain several oncogenes (for example, TP53, PI3K, PTEN), shown to be strongly correlated with BioAge in FIG. 9.",
                                "Applicants also found that the up-regulated portion of the BioAge biomarker could be further dissected using a metagene discovery approach where genes significantly associated with a disease trait and a very strong Pearson correlation with each other are treated as a single unit (Tamayo, P. et al., 2007, Proc.

Neurosci., 28: 1410-1420. Applicants selected samples with relatively low BioAge (BioAge <0) and found a large metagene with exceptionally high mutual correlation between the genes. The range of expression values for the genes comprising the metagene in these samples corresponded to an average three fold up-regulation early in the aging process. This metagene was much more coherent in normal samples than in AD samples. Applicants named this metagene \u201cLipa\u201d (Table1) because it included APOE, PPARA, \u03b3-protocadherins, and other genes involved in lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and cell adhesion. Other notable Lipa genes included HES1, TGFB2, NTRK2, and WIF 1. FIGS. 12A-12D illustrate the relationship between metagene-based biomarkers and selected component genes mentioned herein.",

                                "The higher BioAge score of AD patients explained more than 50% of the differential expression between normal (non-demented) and AD cohorts. In the range of BioAge scores in which AD and normal individuals overlap, there was a significant residual differential expression, composed of several distinct sub-patterns that explain a large fraction of the normal-to-AD variance. Applicants focused on 88 AD and 43 normal brain samples with matched moderate levels of BioAge between \u22120.1 and 0.3. Applicants identified 4,500 genes that are differentially expressed between the two cohorts (ANOVA p<0.005, absolute fold change >10%, FDR <0.1). FIGS. 3A and 3B show the supervised metagene analysis of these genes based on clustering using gene-gene correlation as a distance measure (see Example ?). In this analysis, the three most regulated metagenes responsible for the majority of the gene expression differences associated with the disease were identified.",
                                "The first and the largest group of about 2,000 genes, herein defined as \u201cNdStress,\u201d was associated with various metabolic disruptions. This signature contained some genes that were up-regulated (+NdStress, Table 5) and others that were down-regulated (\u2212NdStress, Table 6) in AD subjects. The expression of these genes was maintained in a relatively stable narrow range in normal brains with low BioAge with relatively low coherence (FIG. 3A), while in AD subjects, the expression of these genes varied dramatically and was highly correlated (FIGS. 3A and 3B, Table 8). Although the plethora of biological pathways reflected in this large biomarker precluded significant enrichment of an individual pathway after correcting for multiple testing, the up-regulated (+NdStress, Table 5) arm of this signature contained multiple heatshock and proteosome proteins, such as HSP1A1, STIP1, HSP1B1, PSMB1/D6, and the TGF\u03b2 signaling proteins SMAD2 and SMAD4 (FIGS. 12A-12D). The down-regulated (\u2212NdStress, Table 6) arm of NdStress is enriched in genes involved in folate metabolism, such as DHFRL1, MTR and FPGS, possibly related to the alterations in folate and homocysteine observed in AD patients. FIG. 4 shows the relationship between NdStress and BioAge, which moderately correlated in AD samples (\u03c1=0.53, p<1E-13). At the same time, NdStress and chronological age correlated negatively (\u03c1=\u22120.14, p=0.05). This metagene score explained 22% of variance in differentially expressed genes and demonstrated AUROC of 0.75 in separating AD and normal samples.",
                                "The second metagene, herein defined as \u201cAlz,\u201d consisted of about 200 genes up-regulated in AD (FIGS. 3A and 3B, Table 7). This signature was enriched in genes involved in cell communication/adhesion, fibrosis, mesoderm development and ossification such as numerous collagen genes, BMP genes, CTSK, MFAP2/4, FN1, VIM, WNT6 and TWIST1 (FIG. 10, Table 9). This signature also contained several prostaglandin synthases and receptors. Alz positively correlated with both BioAge (\u03c1=0.40, p<1E-7) and chronological age (\u03c1=0.23, p=0.002), see also FIG. 4. This metagene score explained 6% of variance in differentially expressed genes and demonstrated AUROC of 0.69 in separating AD and normal samples.",
                                "Finally, a small, but exceptionally tightly correlated, metagene herein defined as \u201cInflame\u201d (Table 4) contained about 250 genes upregulated with AD including many inflammation markers, such as IL1B, 1L10, IL16, IL18, and HLA genes, as well as markers of macrophages, such as VSIG4, SLC11A1, and apoptosis, such as CASP1/4, TNFRSF1B (p75 death receptor) (FIGS. 3A and 3B, Table 9). The Inflame score explained 11% of variance in differentially expressed genes and positively correlated with BioAge (\u03c1=0.47, p=1E-10) and chronological age (\u03c1=0.28, p<0.001) in AD subjects. When used as a classifier, the Inflame score was capable of discriminating AD and normal brain with AUROC of 0.69. These genes maintained their mutual correlation in both normal and AD subjects, but reached significantly higher levels in AD.",
                                "FIG. 4 shows the interplay between the biomarkers discussed above and complex causal relationships between them. For example, the elevation of Inflame preceded the elevation of NdStress, because there are no samples with high NdStress, but low Inflame. However, the correlation between NdStress and Inflame is low in AD samples where NdStress is active (\u03c1=0.21, p=0.004). Applicants also observed a very low correlation between NdStress and Alz (\u03c1=0.21, p=0.004) and moderate correlation between Alz and Inflame (\u03c1=0.47, p=1E-11) in AD samples.",

                                "A unique feature of this dataset is the availability of samples from different brain regions belonging to the same individual. All biomarkers determined from prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples were tested for coherence in visual cortex (VC) and cerebellum (CR) samples. Applicants confirmed that BioAge and the disease-specific signatures were still expressed coherently and differentially between normal and AD subjects. Applicants then performed direct correlation analysis between the signature scores in different regions (FIGS. 5A-5D and 11A-11D). The biomarker, BioAge, demonstrated a relatively high correlation of 0.81 between VC1 and PFC1, with residual differences possibly reflecting different levels of aging between the brain regions. The Lipa biomarker also demonstrated a high correlation of 0.80 between these regions. Applicants determined that the correlation between Inflame scores in PFC 1 and VC1 was equal to 0.83. The highest correlation of 0.93 between PFC1 and VC1 was observed in the NdStress biomarker. Similar results were obtained between PFC 1 and CR1 (FIGS. 11A-11D). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants believe this exceptionally high level of correlation between the regions is likely explained by the systemic nature of inflammation and metabolic regulation that span diverse brain regions. Conversely, Alz scores did not show any significant correlations between regions in AD subjects, suggesting that this biomarker was confined to affected brain regions (Braak, H. and Braak, E., 1991, Acta Neuropathol., 82: 239-259) and more specifically related to AD pathogenesis (FIGS. 5A-5D and 11A-11D).",
                                "Furthermore, the disease biomarkers were fully validated in a hold-out set of samples (Phase 2), which in addition contained some Huntington disease (HD) subjects. As shown in FIGS. 12A-12D, BioAge, NdStress, and Inflame were significantly elevated in both AD and HD samples (p<0.01). In general, these biomarkers reached similar average levels in AD and HD samples in all profiled brain regions. However, in PFC2 the average BioAge reached in HD subjects was significantly lower than that of AD subjects (p=1E-17). These biomarkers, therefore, appear to capture general systemic neurodegenerative processes rather than being specific to AD. The most striking difference between AD and HD subjects was reflected in the Alz biomarker, which again was specific to the presence of AD and was not significantly elevated in any brain region in HD samples (FIG. 6).",

                                "Consistent patterns of gene expression were recently observed by coexpression analyses in several large cohorts of brain samples from non-demented individuals (Oldham, et al., 2008, Nat. Neurosci., 11: 1271-1282). Applicants discovered several, reproducible metagenes, defined herein as \u201cbrain transcriptome modules,\u201d some of which have been associated with genes expressed in specific brain cell types. In particular, the most reproducible modules, M4/5, M9, M15, and M16 (data not shown), were associated with microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, respectively, in the cited work (Oldham, et al., 2008, Nat. Neurosci., 11: 1271-1282). Applicants validated the coherence of these modules in the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC) (McLean Hospital, Belmont, Mass.) dataset by metagene analysis and found that more than 90% of the genes comprising these modules strongly correlated with each other (\u03c1>0.7) within normal subjects. This analysis supports the finding that the latent structure of gene expression in cortex was preserved in dataset used herein.",
                                "In addition, we compared the gene expression profiling captured by the brain transcriptome modules with the biomarker, BioAge, and the disease-specific patterns discovered herein. Applicants found a strong correlation between M4/5 associated with microglia and the Inflame biomarker (\u03c1=0.92). In addition, \u201castrocytic\u201d M15 correlates with BioAge (\u03c1=0.83) and \u201cneuronal\u201d M16 negatively correlates with BioAge (\u03c1=\u22120.93). Applicants also found that none of the major brain transcriptome modules strongly correlated with either the neurodegenerative NdStress or the AD specific Alz biomarkers. This confirms that these expression patterns are novel patterns that can only be detected in brains of those individuals affected by the disease.",
                                "**Systemic and Localized Molecular Changes in AD**",
                                "This genome-wide gene expression profiling study of a large cohort of AD and normal aging brains revealed large groups of genes that vary as a function of age and disease status. When the hundreds of gene expression values contained in each of these sets are converted into a single quantitative trait, new molecular biomarkers of biological aging and disease progression emerge. The transcriptional profiles of AD brains were profoundly different from those in non-demented individuals, with thousands of genes differing in their levels of expression between the two cohorts. To reduce the complexity of the observed changes, Applicants focused on key gene expression patterns that explained the most variability across the cohorts. Applicants have found that the most significant pattern in terms of variance explained, both within and between the AD and non-demented cohorts, was BioAge, a biomarker of the level of biological aging in the brain. BioAge captured the extent of gradual molecular changes in the normal aging brain by averaging the gene expression changes associated with a multitude of synchronous physiological events. BioAge can be accurately and reliably assigned to each sample in the dataset and used to describe the molecular state of the brain in the same way as other clinical and physiological measurements are used by one of ordinary skill in the art.",
                                "Genes up-regulated with BioAge are associated with activation of cell cycle regulation pathways, lipid metabolism and axon guidance pathways (Table 2). Misexpression of cell cycle genes in post-mitotic neurons has been observed in aging and in AD subjects and has been suggested to be an important mechanism of neurodegeneration (Woods, et al., 2007, Biochim. Biophs. Acta, 1772: 503-508; Bonda, et al., 2010, Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., 36: 157-163). The enrichment for oncogenes within this set is consistent with biological responses to genotoxic stress activated during aging in an increasingly larger population of brain cells. Genes down-regulated with BioAge were associated with a decrease in neuronal activity. Most of these genes maintained a strong correlation (connectivity) with BioAge throughout the entire range of the biomarker. This implies that the core of biological aging is one gradual change rather than several distinct transitions.",
                                "Contrary to most aging patterns, a significant loss of connectivity with aging was observed for the Lipa metagene (Table 1) that included APOE, HES1, and TGFB2 (FIG. 10). APOE and most of the other Lipa genes were expressed at high levels in all AD patients and some normal individuals. This suggests that up-regulation of lipid metabolism happens sometime early in the aging process and that activation of APOE and changes in lipid metabolism are early precursors of disease, possibly related to engagement of protection mechanisms.",
                                "Applicants have also found three other distinct disease-specific patterns. The biomarker, NdStress, which included both up- (+NdStress, Table 5) and down-regulated (\u2212NdStress, Table 6) genes, dominated differential expression between AD and non-demented brains matched for BioAge score. The up-regulated genes contained multiple heatshock and proteasome proteins. Activation of these pathways may reflect the response to disease-related stress. Another set of genes in this module are cell cycle genes indicative of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The down-regulated (\u2212NdStress, Table 6) arm of NdStress was enriched in one-carbon/folate metabolism genes and could underlay the perturbations in folic acid and one-carbon metabolism that are one of the earliest biomarkers associated with neurodegenerative disorders including AD (Kronenberg, et al., 2009, Curr. Mol. Med., 9: 315-23; Van Dam, F. and Van Gool, W. A., 2009, Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr., 48: 425-30; McCampbell, A. et al., 2011, J. Neurochem., 116, 82-92).",
                                "The second largest disease-specific pattern, Alz (Table 7), contained genes associated with cell adhesion, migration, morphogenesis. This biomarker prominently featured genes characteristic of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as VIM, TWIST1, and FN1 (Kalluri, R. and Weinberg, R. A., 2009, J. Clin. Invest., 119: 1420-8) (FIG. 10). The connection of Alz with EMT suggests a major transformation in brain tissue physiology including changes in receptor signaling, growth factor dependence, and cell adhesion during the disease. The third disease-specific biomarker, Inflame, which reflects chronic neuro-inflammation (Jakob-Roetne, R. and Jacobsen, H., 2009, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 48: 3030-3059; Eikelenboom, P. et al., 2006, J. Neural. Transm., 113: 1685-95), suggests a similarity between AD with other examples of EMT type 2, such as tissue fibrosis, where chronic inflammation and up-regulation of TGFB2 contribute to pathogenesis (Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009). The levels of Alz in AD are much higher than in unaffected brain regions or in the PFC of HD, suggesting that these gene expression changes are not generally reflecting neuro-degeneration, but rather relate to AD pathology.",
                                "Further, BioAge and Inflame are consistent with published analysis of healthy brain transcriptome and associated with neuronal, astrocytic, and microglial modules (Oldham, et al., 2008, Nat. Neurosci., 11:1271-1282). Importantly, Applicants found that NdStress and Inflame have virtually identical scores in different regions from the same individual. This suggests they measure systemic changes in brain tissue that happen across multiple cell types and layers and are independent of the diverse morphology and makeup of different brain regions. Alz scores, on the other hand, are not the same across all brain regions and had the highest levels in prefrontal cortex, indicating a local rather than systemic nature of EMT.",

                                "Applicants' analysis of gene expression changes in the brains of AD patients confirms that AD is both similar and distinct from the process of normal aging. Although each brain was captured only in a particular (postmortem) state and was not studied longitudinally, Applicants can assemble these data as a function of time to propose a few generalized aging trajectories (FIG. 7A). BioAge and chronological age showed a significant association in non-demented individuals and no association in AD patients, who had consistently high BioAge scores regardless of their chronological age. Applicants attributed this observation to a difference in the strength of the aging drivers, distribution of the aging rates, and different causes of death in the two cohorts. In non-demented individuals, the drivers of aging were weak. The rates of aging were relatively slow and consistent across the population and, in the absence of unnatural causes, death was likely related to aging issues other than the health of the brain. Since non-demented individuals likely died from causes largely unrelated to neurodegeneration, each individual death is conceptually a random event along the generalized brain aging trajectory. In AD patients, the drivers of aging were stronger and variable across the cohort and the death was generally related to the health of the brain, that became incompatible with life regardless of the chronological age. The extrapolated BioAge of normal patients would not reach the highest AD levels until the age of 140 years. Thus, AD can be viewed as an aberrant aging of the brain, which retains the gene expression hallmarks of normal aging combined with additional patterns associated with pathological drivers of the disease and response of the brain tissue to disease-related processes.",
                                "For AD patients, the studies herein are missing early stages of the aging trajectory and can only observe late stages with terminal high BioAge. Unlike the normal cohort that can be represented by a single trajectory, the AD cohort covers a family of trajectories with different rates of biological aging. Patients with a fast rate of biological aging would succumb to disease at younger ages and generally would have higher levels of BioAge relative to their chronological age in the early phases of disease. However, since the studies herein did not include longitudinal specimens from subjects before they developed the disease, a second biomarker was required to explain disease progression rates after BioAge is maximal. The expression profile of NdStress fits the properties expected of this progression rate biomarker as it was highest level in chronologically young AD patients and it significantly correlates with (+) BioAge and (\u2212) chronological age. Alz, on the other hand, is the highest in chronologically older patients and does not correlate with BioAge. Thus, patients with high NdStress likely have more accelerated aging trajectories than patients with high Alz. The older chronological age of Alz onset may suggest that the acceleration of BioAge due to Alz does not occur until the level of BioAge of the brain reaches a certain threshold. The quantitative assessment of the brain biological age in terms of BioAge and the rate of its disease-related acceleration in terms of NdStress are two critical hypotheses proposed in this work.",
                                "Another way to look at the aging trajectory is to model it as a set of molecular transitions that lead to changes in BioAge. Examination of biomarker scores for BioAge-low brains in FIG. 4 suggests that up-regulation and disruption of the Lipa biomarker happens very early in the aging process because most of these samples have the lowest Lipa scores in the cohort. Comparing Inflame with Lipa and BioAge shows that activation of the inflammation biomarker also happens early in the aging process but not as early as Lipa activation because there are BioAge-young patients with high Lipa score but low Inflame. These and other observations can be summarized in the form of a state transition model shown in FIG. 7B. Aging starts with up-regulation of APOE and other lipid metabolic genes, together with Notch and TGF\u03b2, signaling signifying the transition from N0 to N1. The subsequent up-regulation of the Inflame biomarker is associated with transition from N1 to N2. The brains in these states were diagnosed as normal because the subjects did not yet exhibit any cognitive impairment associated with AD. The next transition, from N2 to A1, is associated with massive disruptions in metabolic pathways and marked acceleration of aging follows. However, some brains avoid transitioning to A1 and continue to age into N3. Another transition to the AD state A2 can happen later, since Applicants observed brains herein with high scores for both NdStress and Alz, which may be associated with a different path to AD. Alternatively, it is possible that A2 is localized to a brain region not covered in the dataset herein. Thus, this transition may appear later than A1 in a particular brain region and happen much earlier in some other brain region.",
                                "This proposed model is most consistent with an age-based hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease that postulates three fundamental steps: 1) an initial injury aggravated by aging, 2) chronic neuroinflammation, and 3) a transition of most brain cells to a new state (Herrup, K. 2010, J. Neurosci., 30: 16755-16762). These key stages of the disease were independently observed and associated with transcriptional changes in Applicants' analysis of brain transcriptome. Applicants herein also identified a striking resemblance of the biological processes behind the disease progression biomarkers and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kalluri, R. and Weinberg, R. A., 2009, J. Clin. Invest., 119:1420:1428). The AD processes are most similar to EMT type 2, which is dependent on inflammation-inducing injuries for initiation and continued occurrence. Associated with tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis in kidney, lung, and liver, EMT type 2 generates mesenchymal cells that produce excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM). Similarly, a transition of AD brain into a tissue enriched with mesenchymal cells produces a large amount of ECM containing \u03b2-amyloid. This model of the disease implies that multiple independent genetic factors, as well as infections and/or injuries may accelerate consecutive transitions leading to disease. This also suggests that different therapeutic strategies may be appropriate for early and late disease stages. Therapies targeting lipid metabolism and inflammation may be more effective in the early stages. In the late stages, when the brain becomes enriched in mesenchymal-like signaling and adhesion processes, novel approaches that support the survival of the new state of the brain tissue should be considered.",

The signature score, i.e. Score, is calculated from groups of genes that are highly correlated. Cell lines and non-human mammals would be evaluated to identify and select a model having a comparable signature score for each of the biomarkers, i.e. BioAge, Inflame, NdStress, and Alz. We used wild-type (C57B) and AD (NFEV) mouse models. The animals were put on a normal and methionine-rich diet (Test Diet, Richmond, Ind.) for 2 to 11 weeks. The increased value of BioAge or Inflame along the y-axis in the AD model with respect to wild type demonstrated that the aging and inflammation processes in AD have progressed further than in normal controls.",

Blood samples from seven control (CTRL), eight AD-early, ten AD (late), and nine multiple sclerosis (MS) samples were profiled. The NdStress gene expression score, i.e. gene signature score, was calculated after translating the biomarker gene symbols into human equivalents and matching the probes on a human microarray (Affeymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.). The NdStress score shows elevated values in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases in comparison to control subjects. This suggests the possibility of using the NdStress biomarker as a peripheral diagnostic tool, that is a biomarker for use with a fluid sample, such as blood, plasma, or CSF."

Applicants utilized a procedure of exploring covariance structure of the gene expression data which was similar to metagene identification (Tamayo, 2007, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 104: 5959-5964), factor analysis of gene expression (Carvalho, 2008, J. Amer. Stat. Assoc., 103: 1438-1456), and supervised gene module discovery (Oldham, 2008, Nat. Neurosci., 11: 1271-1282; Miller, 2008, J. Neurosci., 28: 1410-1420). Instead of genome-wide search for metagenes followed by analysis of associations between metagenes and disease traits, Applicants used a supervised approach. After selecting genes significantly associated with the disease, Applicants agglomeratively clustered them using Pearson correlation as a distance measure. Especially tight and large clusters in the dendrogram were then assigned to biomarkers, i.e. the dendrogram was cut so that several hundred genes in a branch qualified for a biomarker and the average of their correlations to the mean was not weaker than 0.75. Applicants recognized that some signatures could have two anti-correlated arms representing opposite trends in the gene expression (e.g. genes that are up- and down-regulated with the end point)."

The biomarker score for each sample was calculated as the mean expression levels of the comprising genes or as the arithmetic difference between the means in the positive and negative arms of the signature when both arms were specified. See, for example, Tables 1-7 that show representative genes making up the biomarkers of the invention herein. Thus, the \u201cScore\u201d was calculated as follows:",

The reference intensity I0 for each gene corresponded to the average intensity in the cohort. The overall coherence of biomarkers was evaluated as an average correlation between individual genes and the average score. Applicants found that averaging coherent genes (coherence >0.75) that correlate with each other produced a measure that was more accurate than for individual genes. For all biomarkers identified in this work, the Score represented a continuous measure of progression for a particular aspect of disease in each sample. To evaluate the performance of the signature score, i.e. Score, as a classifier between diseased and normal samples, Applicants used the area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) (Hanley, J. A. and McNeil, B. J., 1982, Radiology, 143: 29-36). AUROC is equal to the probability that two randomly selected tissue samples from two groups will be correctly assigned to the correct group based on the relative values of the classifier."
