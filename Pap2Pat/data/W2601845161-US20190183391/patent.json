                        "In one aspect, the invention provides a method of providing stimulation signals for acoustic coordinated reset neuromodulation therapy to be delivered to a patient. The method comprises providing an audio-detection threshold calibration (such as an audiogram), which defines a frequency dependent hearing level of the patient. The method further comprises providing a frequency-discrimination threshold calibration, which defines an intensity dependent bandwidth of frequencies not discriminable by the patient. The frequency-discrimination threshold calibration represents an implementation of an auditory filter bandwidth as will be described in more detail later on. Moreover, the method comprises evaluating a tinnitus frequency for tinnitus experienced by a patient determining a tinnitus bandwidth as the width of a tinnitus frequency band centered at the tinnitus frequency; and generating at least one (first) primary stimulation signal with a (first) primary stimulation frequency and a (first) primary stimulation intensity such that\n\n\n- - the (first) primary stimulation intensity exceeds a hearing level of\n    the patient, as defined by the audio-detection threshold calibration\n    at the (first) primary stimulation frequency, by a predetermined\n    quantity; and\n  - the (first) primary stimulation frequency is offset from the\n    tinnitus frequency such that a (first) primary stimulation frequency\n    band and the tinnitus frequency band overlap by a predetermined\n    amount, wherein the (first) primary stimulation frequency band\n    represents a frequency band centered at the (first) primary\n    stimulation frequency and having a (first) primary stimulation\n    bandwidth according to a bandwidth defined by the\n    frequency-discrimination threshold calibration at the (first)\n    primary stimulation intensity.",
                        "Preferably, generating the at least one primary stimulation signal comprises:\n\n\n- - determining at least one initial primary stimulation frequency\n    offset from the tinnitus frequency;\n  - determining the primary stimulation intensity based on the at least\n    one initial primary stimulation frequency according to the\n    audio-detection threshold calibration;\n  - determining the (first) primary stimulation bandwidth as a bandwidth\n    defined by the frequency-discrimination threshold calibration at the\n    (first) primary stimulation intensity;\n  - modifying the at least one primary stimulation frequency so that the\n    tinnitus frequency band and a modified primary stimulation frequency\n    band overlap by the predetermined amount, wherein the modified\n    primary stimulation frequency band represents a frequency band with\n    the determined primary stimulation bandwidth centered at the\n    modified (first) primary stimulation frequency; and\n  - generating the at least one primary stimulation signal based on the\n    modified primary stimulation frequency and the primary stimulation\n    intensity.",

                        "In other words, in one aspect there is provided a method of providing, particularly generating, stimulation signals for acoustic coordinated reset neuromodulation therapy. The method comprises evaluating a tinnitus frequency.",
                        "Evaluation of the tinnitus frequency of the patient can be carried out by various pitch matching methods to determine a tinnitus frequency (also called pitch) as experienced by the patient. For example, a tunable tone is delivered to the patient, while the patient adapts the frequency of the tunable tone until it matches the tinnitus frequency as experienced by the patient. Depending on the type of the tinnitus, the frequency of the tinnitus as experienced by the patient may be a center frequency of a noise or it may be a fundamental frequency of a harmonic tone.",
                        "The method further comprises determining, or calculating, a tinnitus bandwidth. Based on the structure and functioning of the human auditory system, it is possible to model the size and location of areas activated in the cortex by auditory stimuli by means of frequency bands characterized by a bandwidth and a center frequency. Since the auditory cortex is tonotopically organized, the center frequency is related to the location while the bandwidth is related to the size of the area. The bandwidths of the frequency bands representing the areas in the cortex are dependent on the intensity of the auditory stimuli. Accordingly, empirical relations based on experiments can be used to model the bandwidth as a function of intensity.",
                        "Even if there is no actual external stimulus, i.e. there is no sound source, tinnitus causes an area in the auditory cortex to be activated so that a patient subjectively perceives a sound. The determined tinnitus bandwidth is the width of a frequency band that represents the tinnitus activation area in the auditory cortex.",
                        "There are different methods for determining the tinnitus bandwidth. In one embodiment, the tinnitus bandwidth may be calculated as the tinnitus frequency multiplied by a predetermined factor. The predetermined factor may be based on experimental and/or theoretical evaluations of the tinnitus bandwidth in relation to its center frequency.",
                        "In one preferred embodiment determining the tinnitus bandwidth comprises:\n\n\n- - determining a tinnitus intensity as an intensity of the tinnitus\n    perceived by the patient; and\n  - determining the tinnitus bandwidth according to a bandwidth defined\n    by the frequency-discrimination threshold calibration at the\n    determined tinnitus intensity.",
                        "In another embodiment, the tinnitus bandwidth may be determined on the basis of the audio-detection threshold calibration. It can be assumed that a reasonable approximation for the tinnitus bandwidth may be the bandwidth of a frequency band representing an actual sound with the same frequency, since it would activate a region in the cortex in the same location. When the bandwidth is modelled as a function of the intensity, as explained, a relation between frequency and intensity may be provided to determine the tinnitus bandwidth. Such a relation may be the audio-detection threshold calibration. Human beings have different hearing thresholds for different frequencies, meaning that the intensity that a sound must have in order to be perceived by the human ear varies depending on the frequency. The audio-detection threshold calibration thus represents the (preferably individual) hearing threshold for different frequencies (within a frequency range relevant for human hearing). Accordingly, an intensity parameter can be determined for the tinnitus based on the tinnitus frequency using the audio-detection threshold calibration. This intensity parameter is then used in the empirical relation linking the intensity to the bandwidth to obtain the tinnitus bandwidth.",
                        "The audio-detection threshold calibration may in some embodiments be obtained by testing the hearing level of the patient fora plurality of frequencies, preferably including the tinnitus frequency and the stimulation frequencies. In other words, the audio-detection threshold calibration may be specific for the patient. In other embodiments, a standard audio-detection threshold calibration may be used, wherein there may be a set of standard audio-detection threshold calibrations that are given by the average of measured curves for individuals with similar characteristics, such as age, gender, profession and so on. Different standard calibrations may also be used for hearing-impaired individuals, if there is e.g. a common underlying cause to the hearing loss.",
                        "After determining the parameters necessary for modelling the tinnitus activation area as a frequency band, which in turn represents a bandpass filter, similar parameters need to be determined to model the activation areas that one or more stimulation signals need to activate for treating tinnitus.",
                        "A stimulation frequency is determined by setting an offset from the tinnitus frequency, i.e. the stimulation frequency is always different from the tinnitus frequency and the difference or offset can be set according to a predefined offset parameter. The stimulation frequency, which is related to the location of the area activated by the stimulation signal, should be close enough to the tinnitus frequency in order to effectively treat tinnitus. The offset value may be decided so that the stimulation frequency lies in a conventional range for CR therapy. Possible values for a multiplicative offset (i.e. a ratio between the stimulation frequency and the tinnitus frequency) may be 1.2 or 1.1\u2014positive offset\u2014or 0.8 or 0.9\u2014negative offset.",
                        "As mentioned above, the hearing threshold of the human auditory system depends on the frequency. In order for the stimulation signal to be perceived by the patient, the intensity of the stimulation signal must be at least above the hearing threshold for the specific stimulation frequency. Preferably, the intensity should exceed the hearing threshold by an amount that makes the stimulation signal clearly perceivable while being comfortable for the patient, i.e. not too loud. Such an amount, which may be determined based on human physiology, can be characterized as a predetermined intensity parameter. Accordingly, the stimulation intensity may be determined in one embodiment as the sum of the hearing threshold level corresponding to the stimulation frequency and the predetermined intensity parameter. The predetermined intensity parameter may be independent of frequency and could be in a range between 5 dB and 15 dB, preferably 10 dB.",
                        "Similarly to what is explained above for the determination of the tinnitus bandwidth, the stimulation bandwidth may be determined on the basis of the stimulation intensity by means of an empirical relation linking the bandwidth and the intensity. In particular, in some embodiments, the bandwidth may be considered to explicitly vary/depend only on the intensity as a first approximation. Although the bandwidth shows a dependence with frequency, this is rather weak, especially for typical tinnitus frequencies in the order of more than 5000 Hz. Accordingly, the bandwidth may be approximated to be a function exclusively of the intensity. However it should be noted that since the intensity is determined with the audio-detection threshold calibration, i.e. depends on the frequency, the individually determined (stimulation and/or tinnitus) bandwidth may have an implicit dependency on the frequency.",
                        "According to the invention, the stimulation frequency is adjusted to take into account the intensity of the stimulation signal, which affects the bandwidth, so that the location and the size of the area activated by the stimulation signal are optimized for therapeutic efficacy. In particular, a predefined overlap between the tinnitus activation area and the stimulation-activated area may be especially suitable for treating tinnitus, and this overlap between areas in the cortex can be translated into an overlap between the tinnitus frequency band and the stimulation frequency band. Accordingly, the initially chosen value of the stimulation frequency, which was based on a predetermined offset, is fine-tuned to achieve a predefined overlap.",
                        "In other words, modifying the stimulation frequency comprises modifying the offset of the stimulation frequency from the tinnitus and re-centering the stimulation bandwidth at the modified stimulation frequency.",
                        "Finally, the stimulation signal having the modified stimulation frequency and the determined stimulation intensity is generated. The term \u201cstimulation signal\u201d is used to denote both an electrical signal that is converted into an acoustic wave perceivable by a patient and an acoustic wave itself, which could be generated also in a different way. In one example, the generated stimulation signals are electrical signals whose amplitude represents a voltage. These electrical signals can be converted into sound by means of a transducer, e.g. a loudspeaker.",
                        "In some embodiments, the stimulation signal devised according to the method described above may nonetheless have a reduced efficacy if external factors interfere with the delivery of the stimulation signal. For example, a considerable intensity of an ambient noise may disturb the perception of the stimulation signal by the patient. The method may, thus, further comprise estimating an ambient noise level parameter e.g. via a microphone and modifying the stimulation intensity based on the ambient noise level parameter. Specifically, the stimulation intensity may be increased by an amount corresponding to the ambient noise level.",
                        "If the stimulation intensity is modified, the stimulation frequency may once again be adjusted to account for it. In particular, the stimulation bandwidth may be re-calculated based on the modified stimulation intensity and the stimulation frequency may again be modified to compensate for the different bandwidth and maintain the same amount of overlap.",
                        "If the ambient noise level decreases or increases further, additional adjustments of the stimulation frequency may be performed. The same applies if the tinnitus patient undergoes a modification of his hearing capabilities, meaning that the intensity contribution from the audio-detection threshold calibration is modified.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the method further comprises:\n\n\n- - generating at least one secondary stimulation signal with a\n    secondary stimulation frequency and a secondary stimulation\n    intensity such that\n    - the secondary stimulation intensity exceeds a hearing level of the\n      patient, as defined by the audio-detection threshold calibration\n      at the secondary stimulation frequency, by a predetermined\n      quantity; and\n    - the secondary stimulation frequency is offset from the tinnitus\n      frequency by an amount greater than the offset of the primary\n      stimulation frequency such that a secondary stimulation frequency\n      band and the tinnitus frequency band overlap by a predetermined\n      amount, wherein the secondary stimulation frequency band\n      represents a frequency band centered at the secondary stimulation\n      frequency and having a secondary stimulation bandwidth according\n      to a bandwidth defined by the frequency-discrimination threshold\n      calibration at the secondary stimulation intensity.",
                        "Preferably, generating the at least one secondary stimulation signal comprises:\n\n\n- - determining at least one initial secondary stimulation frequency\n    offset from the tinnitus frequency, wherein the offset of the at\n    least one initial secondary stimulation frequency is greater than\n    the offset of the at least one primary stimulation frequency;\n  - determining the secondary stimulation intensity based on the at\n    least one initial secondary stimulation frequency according to the\n    audio-detection threshold calibration;\n  - determining the secondary stimulation bandwidth as a bandwidth\n    defined by the frequency-discrimination threshold calibration at the\n    secondary stimulation intensity;\n  - modifying the at least one secondary stimulation frequency so that\n    the primary stimulation frequency band and a modified secondary\n    stimulation frequency band overlap by the predetermined amount,\n    wherein the modified secondary stimulation frequency band represents\n    a frequency band with the determined secondary stimulation bandwidth\n    centered at the modified secondary stimulation frequency; and\n  - generating the at least one secondary stimulation signal based on\n    the modified secondary stimulation frequency and the secondary\n    stimulation intensity.",

                        "The basilar membrane within the cochlea of the inner ear has a tonotopic structure, meaning that each one of different locations spatially situated along the membrane is particularly sensitive to a specific frequency. Accordingly, the basilar membrane may be modeled as an array of overlapping band-pass filters that are called auditory filters.",
                        "The band-pass filters are characterized by a bandwidth, wherein sounds having frequencies within the bandwidth of a given auditory filter are not well discriminated as different sounds and interfere with each other. Conventionally the upper and lower cut-off frequencies defining the bandwidth are defined as the points where the intensity falls to 3 dB below the peak amplitude.",
                        "Although the auditory filters are not the same for different frequencies, different intensities and different individuals, a typical auditory filter of a normal ear is preferably distinguishable from a typical auditory filter of a hearing-impaired ear. In particular, the Q factor, which is defined as the ratio between the central frequency and the bandwidth, of a normal ear and of a hearing-impaired ear for the same central frequency is lower for the hearing-impaired ear.",
                        "The shape of the auditory filter is determined by means of psychoacoustic tuning curves, which show a subject's threshold for detection of a pure tone when a masking tone is played to the subject at the same time as the pure tone. In particular, it is measured which level of intensity is needed for a masking tone to eliminate the perception of the pure tone.",
                        "The complex shape of an auditory filter can be approximated by a rectangular frequency band characterized by an equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB). The ERB is such that the rectangular frequency band passes the same amount of energy as the auditory filter that it approximates.",
                        "The basilar membrane is part of the peripheral auditory system and the auditory sensory information is carried from the ear to the auditory cortex by afferent auditory nerve fibers. The tuning curves of the nerve fibers are expected to correspond to the tuning curves obtained from a specific location on the basilar membrane, because each afferent nerve fiber innervates a single inner hair cell, which in turn is aligned with a single location on the membrane. The tinnitus sensation is caused by deafferentation, i.e. the interruption or destruction of the afferent connections, and the size of deafferentation can be measured via the tuning curves. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the size of the area of cortex activation is also related to the shape of the tuning curves and, in particular, to the bandwidths.",
                        "Specifically, since the bandwidth increases with increasing intensity of a sound, the activation area in the cortex is bigger for a tone with higher intensity. The intensity of a sound is the amount of energy transported by a sound wave propagating in a medium past a given area of the medium per unit of time. The faintest sound that the typical human ear can detect has an intensity of about 1*10\u221212 W/m2, which defines the threshold of hearing. The scale for measuring intensity is the decibel (dB) scale, in which the threshold of hearing is assigned a value of zero. The intensity of sound can be expressed in dB HL (hearing level), where the sound pressure is expressed with respect to the hearing threshold of a normal hearing subject (see, for example, ISO 389). The actual hearing level threshold for a specific case depends on many factors such as age of the subject and ambient noise.",
                        "As explained, the size of an activation area in the cortex is proportional to the intensity of an acoustic stimulus. In order to provide an optimal desynchronizing effect of the stimulation signals for treating tinnitus the areas activated by the stimulation signals in the cortex should overlap by predefined amounts. For example, it has been found that an overlap of about 30% among neighboring areas provide considerable therapeutic benefit to the patient.",
                        "Until now CR therapy tones have been fixed and selected with respect to the tinnitus pitch without considering that increased stimulation tone intensities lead to wider activation areas. Currently used tones are only optimal for a particular intensity band. If the stimulation tone intensity needs to be adjusted outside the standard or conventional range (e.g., because of individual hearing thresholds or a noisy environment), stimulation tones can become suboptimal and therapeutic outcome for patients can be reduced.",
                        "According to the invention, the selection of the frequencies and intensities for CR stimulation signals is optimized by adapting the spread of the therapeutic frequencies on the basis of to the intensity of each of the individual tones, as well as optionally with respect to the hearing thresholds of the patient being treated.",
                        "Acoustic CR neuromodulation should be applied slightly above an individual patient's hearing threshold. Let us assume that acoustic CR neuromodulation should be applied X dB above the hearing threshold of an individual patient. Hence, a normal hearing subject with no hearing loss would need a stimulation level of X dB, but a hearing impaired subject having a hearing loss of Y dB HL at a given stimulation frequency would require a stimulation level of (X+Y) dB HL.",
                        "We know from the example of Hopkins and Moore (2011) that the perception of sound changes with signal level in dB HL. This information can be used to configure the spacing of the stimulation signals across a frequency scale with respect to the stimulation intensity or signal level actually required to realize a stimulation tone X dB above an individual hearing threshold.",
                        "If the patient changes the intensity of the stimulation signal, or the intensity is changed automatically by the device delivering the stimulation, the frequencies of the stimulation tones are changed and/or adapted accordingly (i.e., stimulation tone frequencies are changed if the stimulation intensity is modified). No fixed stimulation signal is programmed. Instead, a stimulation algorithm utilizing dB hearing loss (HL) information from a patient assessment and current master volume settings are used to instantaneously define optimal stimulation frequencies. A thresholdogram obtained during the patient assessment is stored and used by an algorithm such that for any set of frequencies a balanced set of stimulation tones can be defined. For high intensity stimulation applications, a wide spread of stimulation tones may be required.",

Using such techniques, the algorithm/software can determine the appropriate intensity (dB HL for the individual patient) corresponding to each of the stimulation tones. For each stimulation tone, the optimal frequency in relation to the pitch frequency (tinnitus frequency) is calculated. The frequency of the stimulation tone is then re-adjusted and the local amplitude requirements are checked again. Using such an iterative process, stimulation frequency and amplitude levels are optimized. For higher-intensity stimulation applications a wider spread of stimulation tones may be required. An example of stimulation tones and how they are calculated is set forth below.",

Some type of inertia or delay may be employed to avoid over-rapid adjustments in stimulation intensity delivered to the patient. Using such techniques, an iPod configured to carry out the methods described herein can be programmed and configured to automatically adjust the intensity of the delivered stimulation, and no intervention by the patient is required. Together with automatic adaptation of the stimulation frequencies, stimulation is optimized and stimulation outcomes are improved. In one embodiment, a stimulation adaptation algorithm is configured to enable programming automated stimulation frequency adjustments based on an above-threshold dB level of stimulation.",

Indeed, for the tinnitus frequency band 10, a determination of the vertical dimension is not necessary and the height could take any value in the representation. Only the bandwidth of the tinnitus frequency band 10 is needed for optimally selecting the frequencies of the stimulation signals. In some cases, determination of the bandwidth is based on a tinnitus intensity parameter, in other cases not, as explained below.",

The proportionality factor may be determined according to empirical relations based on past deliveries of the CR therapy.",

The tinnitus intensity parameter may be determined similarly to the stimulation intensity (see below) on the basis of an audiogram and a predetermined intensity parameter. However, while the stimulation intensity may be used when actually delivering the stimulation signals to the patient, the tinnitus intensity parameter is a functional parameter that models a size of the tinnitus activation area and may or may not correspond to tinnitus loudness as perceived by the patient.

This initial stimulation frequency f0 is only a starting point for the optimization process herein described and, thus, does not necessarily coincide with the stimulation frequency f1 that will actually be used for the stimulation signal. The stimulation frequency has a chosen, predetermined value f0 that is usually later adjusted to become f1, for which the area activated by the stimulation signal in the cortex yields the best therapeutic effect, as explained below.",

The stimulation intensity should be understood as the intensity at which the stimulation signal should be delivered to the patient in order for it to be correctly perceived and to effectively treat the tinnitus. Accordingly, the stimulation intensity should be at least above the hearing threshold of the patient and usually be greater than the hearing threshold level by a given interval. In other words, the stimulation intensity can be computed as the sum of two terms, the first term being the hearing threshold level and the second term being a predetermined intensity parameter.",

The width of the stimulation frequency band 20 represents the bandwidth for an auditory filter relative to the stimulation frequency f0 and also the size of the area that will be activated by a stimulation signal with stimulation frequency f0 and corresponding stimulation intensity. Exemplarily, the bandwidth of the stimulation frequency band 20 is an ERB.",
                        "In particular, as explained above, the bandwidth increases with increasing intensity of a sound. More generally, the bandwidth of an auditory filter is directly dependent both on the intensity and the frequency of a tone. However, it has been found that the frequency dependence is negligible in first approximation for high frequencies, which is the case of the tinnitus. For example, in Glasberg & Moore \u201cDerivation of auditory filter shapes from notched-noise data,\u201d Hear. Res. 47, 103-138, 1990 the following approximation was found for the dependence of the relative ERB (i.e. normalized to the center frequency of the band): ERB/24.7\u22121/f=4.37. This approximation shows a weak, inversely proportional dependence with respect to the frequency.",
                        "The relative ERB is typically in the range from 0.15-0.30 (Hopkins & Moore 2011), hence the first factor is in the range of 0.006-0.012. For frequency ranges where tinnitus is mostly observed, e.g. frequencies of 8000 Hz, the second factor is 1/8000, namely 0.000125. So the correction is 1-2%, which can be neglected for the sake of simplification.",
                        "Accordingly, in this exemplary embodiment the direct dependency of the bandwidth on the frequency will be partially accounted for by considering the relative ERB but other corrections will be neglected. The stimulation bandwidth as relative ERB is considered to be only a function of the intensity. However, since the intensity is calculated based on the frequency, there is still an indirect dependence of the relative ERB on the frequency.",
