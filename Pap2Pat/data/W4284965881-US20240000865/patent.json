                        "Enteric and foodborne pathogens present a major healthcare and economic burden. Amongst the major pathogens causing diarrhea are Listeria spp., Staphylococcus spp., Salmonella spp., E. coli, and Campylobacter spp. (EFSA and ECDC, 2018).",
                        "Campylobacteriosis is the most frequently reported bacterial foodborne infection both in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US), and its major cause is Campylobacter jejuni. The disease symptoms include, diarrhoea, fever and cramps, which can lead to the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a severe neurological condition (Kaakoush et al., 2015; Nachamkin et al., 1998; EFSA and ECDC 2018). Campylobacter infections are a major burden on health care industries and national economies, as the estimated total annual cost of the disease and its consequences is \u20ac2.4 billion (BIOHAZ, 2011; EFSA and ECDC, 2018). New and better interventions are needed to tackle this pathogen.",
                        "Most of C. jejuni infections have been associated with poultry meat and the poultry industry, which is also a major source of antibiotic resistant C. jejuni strains, as more than 50% of isolates from poultry are now resistant to at least one antibiotic. This presents a high risk of resistant C. jejuni spreading through the food chain (EFSA and ECDC, 2019).",
                        "Because C. jejuni is a common avian commensal, efforts are being made to tackle the pathogen at its primary source, the chicken reservoir. Once Campylobacter has been introduced into a farm, its fast spread is imminent (Berndtson et al., 1996), thus are effective control measures of great importance. These can include pre-harvest measures (biosecurity and hygiene measures) for prevention of Campylobacter entrance onto a farm and limitation of its spread, and post-harvest measures (freezing, hot-water treatment, irradiation, and chemical decontamination) for reduction of Campylobacter after slaughter (Sahin et al., 2015).",
                        "The reduction of Campylobacter in the chicken intestine by even 1 log10 CFU can reduce the public health risk by 50% to 90%, thus is the reduction of Campylobacter in the poultry production the best starting point for improvement (BIOHAZ, 2011; Meunier et al. 2016; Dogan et al. 2019).",
                        "Probiotics can be used as a pre-harvest measure for pathogen control on the poultry farm (Alagawany et al., 2018; Sahin et al., 2015). Probiotics can have beneficial effects on poultry, such as growth promotion, immunomodulation, and inhibition of pathogens. Modes of action of probiotic bacteria against pathogens can include production of organic acids and antibacterial substances, competitive exclusion of pathogens, modulation of the host immune system, and others. Amongst bacteria studied and used in poultry pharming as probiotics, Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Bacillus spp. Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. can be found (Alagawany et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2005; Lutful Kabir, 2009).",
                        "Bacillus subtilis strains as poultry probiotics can be found in commercial formulations, such as GalliPro (Chr Hansen), Calsporin (ORFFA) and Alterion (Novozymes). Different B. subtilis strains, either alone or in combination with other bacteria, have shown to improve feed conversion and body weight in chickens, reduce lesions caused by Clostridium perfringens, prolong intestinal villi in necrotic enteritis, modulate microbiota to improve Lactobacillus counts in intestine, and lower the count of pathogens such as C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and others, in chickens (Fritts et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2018; Hmani et al., 2017; Jayaraman et al., 2013; Park et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2015). Different B. subtilis strains have shown some promising results with C. jejuni reduction, although this anti-Campylobacter effect is strains specific (Saint-Cyr et al., 2016). Not all B. subtilis treatment will result in lowered C. jejuni numbers in the chicken intestine making the proper selection of an anti-CampylobacterB. subtilis strain very important.",
                        "Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a Bacillus subtilis strain having improved anti-Campylobacter activity."

                                "C. jejuni represents a major health threat in the general human population. A key issue during food production is transmission by abiotic surfaces, where the formation of biofilms can assist in C. jejuni growth and survival. Here we investigate the potential of B. subtilis PS-216 to antagonize C. jejuni growth in static co-culture inoculated at 1:10 ratio (B. subtilis:C. jejuni) and CFU/mL of each species determined at specific times by plating the samples on selective media. B. subtilis significantly inhibited C. jejuni at 14 h (P(14)=0.0046), 16 h (P(16)=0.009) and 24 h of co-incubation (p(24)=4 E-4). The CFU/mL of C. jejuni after 24 h incubation at 42\u00b0 C. in co-culture with B. subtilis was significantly lower (6 log10 CFU/mL) than the CFU of C. jejuni monoculture (8.8 log10 CFU/mL) (P(24h)=4 10\u22124), with the 2.8 log10 reduction in CFU/mL of C. jejuni cells in the presence of B. subtilis. (FIG. 7A). At earlier time points 10 h (P(10)=0.22) and 12 h (P(12)=0.14) of co-incubation inhibition was visible but not significant. C. jejuni did not affect the growth of B. subtilis PS-216 with (P(10)=0.33; P(12)=0.64; P(14)=0.55; P(15)=0.87; P(24)=0.5) (FIG. 8A).",

We quantified attached cells after B. subtilis and C. jejuni mixed at 1:1 ratio were grown 42\u00b0 C. for 24 h. The number (CFU/ml) of adhered C. jejuni cells in mixed species biofilm was significantly lower (4.9 log10 CFU/mL) than in monoculture (7.4 log10 CFB CFU/mL) (P(24)=0.002). The presence of B. subtilis, therefore, reduced the CFU/mL of C. jejuni by 2.4 log10 (FIG. 7B). In contrast, CFU/mL of adhered B. subtilis PS-216 in monoculture and co-culture were comparable (P(24)=0.54) (FIG. 8B).",

However, the C. jejuni-B. subtilis interspecies interactions in biofilms are poorly understood. To further investigate mixed species biofilms we incubated fluorescently tagged C. jejuni (WT-GFP) in the presence and absence of fluorescently tagged B. subtilis PS-216 (WT-RFP1) grown for 24 h at 42\u00b0 C. in 96-well microtiter plates. Confocal scanning microscopy that C. jejuni predominantly occupied the bottom of the well in mono cultures forming submerged cell aggregates with characteristic finger-like structures (C. jejuni submerged biofilm) (FIG. 7C). However, when grown with B. subtilis, the biofilm formation of C. jejuni was not visible. B. subtilis PS-216 biofilm, on the other hand, was not affected by the presence of C. jejuni. B. subtilis cells formed biofilm at the bottom of the well (B. subtilis submerged biofilm) and at the air-liquid interface (B. subtilis pellicle) (FIG. 7C) regardless of C. jejuni.",

After 24 h incubation in co-culture with B. subtilis C. jejuni dropped for 4.2 log10. In monoculture C. jejuni grew to 8.6 log10 CFU/mL but in co-culture only to 4.4 log10 CFU/mL (P(24h)=7 10\u22126)(FIG. 1C).

The lower chamber contained C. jejuni species, after which an inlay of B. subtilis was submerged into the C. jejuni chamber. Our results show, that inhibition of C. jejuni by B. subtilis PS-216 is not cell-contact dependent, since the CFU/mL of C. jejuni after 24 h incubation in co-culture with B. subtilis was significantly lower (5.7 log10 CFU/mL) than the CFU/mL of C. jejuni monoculture (9.4 log10 CFU/mL) (P(24h)=7.6 10\u22129), with 3.7 log10 reduction CFU/mL of C. jejuni cells in the presence of B. subtilis.

Using CLSM and bright field microscopy, the C. jejuni submerged biofilm was no longer visible after 12 h of B. subtilis-C. jejuni co-incubation (t12) (FIG. 9).
