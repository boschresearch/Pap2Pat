    "date": "2022-07-08",
    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, or campylobacteriosis, in humans worldwide, and poultry serves as a major source of infection. To reduce the risk associated with C. jejuni transmission via poultry meat, effective interventions during poultry production are needed, and the use of probiotics is a promising approach. In this study, 15 Bacillus subtilis strains were initially screened for their anti-Campylobacter activities. B. subtilis PS-216 strain demonstrated the best anti-Campylobacter activity against 15 C. jejuni isolates when examined using in vitro co-cultures. To evaluate the suitability of B. subtilis PS-216 for probiotic use, its susceptibility to eight clinically important antimicrobials and simulated gastric conditions was investigated. B. subtilis PS-216 was sensitive to all of the tested antibiotics. Although vegetative cells were sensitive to gastric conditions, B. subtilis PS-216 spores were highly resistant. We further evaluated the use of a B. subtilis PS-216 spore preparation (2.5 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL water) to prevent and/or reduce C. jejuni colonization in broiler chickens in vivo. Compared to the untreated group, significantly lower Campylobacter counts were detected in caeca of broilers continuously treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores in their drinking water. Furthermore, broilers continuously treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores showed improved weight gain, compared to the control group. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of B. subtilis PS-216 for use in poultry to reduce C. jejuni colonization and improve weight gain.",

                "Campylobacteriosis is among the most frequently reported bacterial foodborne infection in both the European Union (EU) and the United States, with Campylobacter jejuni as the major causative agent. In the last decade, the number of confirmed infections in the EU exceeded 200,000/year. Symptoms of campylobacteriosis include diarrhea, fever and cramps. Death rarely occurs, but complications can increase more than fivefold due to infections with antibiotic-resistant strains (Helms et al., 2005; EFSA and ECDC, 2021a,b).",
                "As C. jejuni is a common avian commensal, efforts are being made to tackle the pathogen at its primary source, the reservoir in chickens. Once Campylobacter is introduced onto a farm, its fast spread is imminent (Berndtson et al., 1996), and therefore effective control measures are of great importance. These can include pre-harvest measures (e.g., biosecurity, hygiene measures) to prevent Campylobacter from entering a farm and to limit its spread, and post-harvest measures (e.g., freezing, hot-water treatment, irradiation, chemical decontamination) to reduce Campylobacter after animal slaughter (Sahin et al., 2015). Reduction of Campylobacter in the chicken intestine can significantly reduce the public health risk, and thus the control of Campylobacter in poultry production is considered one of the most effective strategies for intervention (Meunier et al., 2016; Dogan et al., 2019; Koutsoumanis et al., 2020).",
                "Probiotics can be used as a pre-harvest measure for pathogen control on poultry farms (Sahin et al., 2015; Alagawany et al., 2018; Koutsoumanis et al., 2020). Probiotics can have multiple beneficial effects on poultry, such as growth promotion, immunomodulation and inhibition of pathogens. The modes of action of probiotic bacteria against pathogens can include production of organic acids and antibacterial substances, competitive exclusion of pathogens, modulation of the host immune system, and others (reviewed by El-Hack et al., 2020; Jha et al., 2020). The main bacteria studied and used as probiotics in poultry are Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Bacillus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp. (Hong et al., 2005; Lutful Kabir, 2009; Alagawany et al., 2018).",
                "Bacillus subtilis as a poultry probiotic that is included in commercial formulations, such as GalliPro (Chr Hansen), Calsporin (ORFFA), and Alterion (Novozymes). The administration in chickens of various B. subtilis strains either alone or in combination with other bacteria can improve feed conversion and body weight, reduce lesions caused by Clostridium perfringens, elongate intestinal villi in necrotic enteritis, modulate the microbiota to improve intestinal Lactobacillus numbers, and reduce the number of pathogens such as C. perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis and others (Fritts et al., 2000; Jayaraman et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015; Hmani et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017; Hayashi et al., 2018). Probiotic effects of different B. subtilis strains against C. jejuni in poultry have been well documented, although their anti-Campylobacter effects were shown to be variable and strain specific (Saint-Cyr et al., 2016), which indicates that not every B. subtilis treatment will result in reduced C. jejuni counts in the chicken intestine. Therefore, effective and reliable B. subtilis probiotics that carry anti-Campylobacter traits remain to be developed.",
                "The aim of this study was to initially test different B. subtilis strains for their in vitro anti-Campylobacter activities, and then to apply the best one to in vivo testing in broiler chickens. From the 15 B. subtilis strains tested against C. jejuni NCTC 11168 in co-cultures, B. subtilis PS-216 showed the best anti-Campylobacter activity and was chosen for further evaluation. In addition to examining its anti-Campylobacter activity against different C. jejuni strains, B. subtilis PS-216 was evaluated for its antimicrobial resistance profile and its survival in the gut environment, using simulated intestinal conditions in vitro. Finally, we evaluated the use of B. subtilis PS-216 spores to prevent or reduce C. jejuni colonization in broiler chickens, and as well as their influence on the broiler weight gain. These results show that when given continuously as a water additive in broilers, B. subtilis PS-216 spores can reduce C. jejuni colonization in the broiler intestine and increased broiler body weight."

The broilers underwent the following treatment regimens (Figure 2A): (i) Control group, inoculated with C. jejuni but not treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores; (ii) Pre-treatment group, treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores 7 days prior to C. jejuni inoculation (B. subtilis PS-216 as a preventive measure); (iii) Continuous treatment group, treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores for the duration of the experiment (21 days); and (iv) Post-treatment group, treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores 8 days after the broilers were colonized with C. jejuni (B. subtilis PS-216 as a curative measure).",
                        "All of the broilers had baseline Bacillus spore counts in their feces (3.8 \u00d7 103 CFU/g feces) at placement when they were 1 day old, and as expected, the Bacillus spore counts were higher when the broilers were given B. subtilis PS-216 spores in their drinking water (Figure 2B). Furthermore, these higher Bacillus spore counts (> 5 \u00d7 104 CFU/g feces) dropped abruptly after treatment cessation. This is exemplified by the Pre-treatment group of broilers, where high Bacillus spore counts were detected at first sampling during the B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatment (day 0 after inoculation with C. jejuni), with a drop to baseline (comparable to untreated Control group) after treatment cessation (second sampling, day 5 after inoculation with C. jejuni) (Figure 2B). For the last feces sampling day (day 11 after inoculation with C. jejuni), all of the treated groups (Pre-treatment, Continuous treatment, Post-treatment) showed higher Bacillus spore counts compared to the untreated Control group (by 1.57, 3.19, 2.94 log CFU/g feces, respectively). Campylobacter counts showed no significant differences between groups at cloacal swab samplings (Supplementary Figure 2).",
                        "At 21 days of age, all of the broilers were sacrificed, and their cecum contents were examined for C. jejuni and for Bacillus spores. C. jejuni was detected in all of the broilers, regardless of the treatment regimens (Figure 3A). However, compared to the untreated Control group, there was a significant decrease in C. jejuni counts in the cecum contents in the group continuously treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores (P = 0.002), with a mean decrease of 1.2 log CFU/g feces in the C. jejuni counts. In contrast, the C. jejuni counts in the Pre-treatment and Post-treatment groups were comparable to the untreated Control group. This indicates that the continuous supplementation of broilers with B. subtilis PS-216 spores is an effective measure to lower the CFU counts of C. jejuni in the caeca.",
                        "For the Bacillus spore counts, the 7-days pre-treatment of the broilers with B. subtilis PS-216 spores had no effects on the final Bacillus spore counts in the cecum, as this was comparable to the untreated Control group (Figure 3B). However, the Bacillus spore counts in the broilers treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores until the necropsy time (Continuous treatment, Post-treatment) were higher than those in the untreated Control group (increases of 2.76, 2.68 log CFU/g feces, respectively; P < 0.05)."

Indeed, the weights of the broilers in the three groups treated with B. subtilis PS-216 spores were significantly higher than those of the untreated Control group (Figure 4; P < 0.05). An average increase of 158 g was measured for the Pre-treatment group, 134 g for the Continuous treatment group, and 124 g for the Post-treatment group, which represented further weight increases over the non-treated Control group of 37, 32, and 30%, respectively.",

                "The food-borne pathogen C. jejuni is among the most prevalent bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the EU and the United States (Tam and O\u2019Brien, 2016; Kuhn et al., 2020). Although C. jejuni can be spread through various routes, the main source of C. jejuni is the reservoir in chickens. Thus, control of C. jejuni at the farm level should help to reduce the risk of C. jejuni spread through the food chain. Probiotics (i.e., live-fed microbials) can provide benefits to the animal host, and if shown to be effective for the reduction of C. jejuni, they can be used as a pre-harvest intervention on farms (van Wagenberg et al., 2020). In the present study, we identified B. subtilis PS-216 as an additive that can be given to broiler chickens in the form of spores in the drinking water to reduce C. jejuni colonization and to increase the broiler weight gain.",
                "Previous studies have reported that probiotic bacteria can show species-specific and strain-specific anti-Campylobacter activities both in vitro and in the chicken host (Mohan, 2015; Mortada et al., 2020). Moreover, Wine et al. (2009) reported that one Lactobacillus strain was effective for the inhibition of C. jejuni, while another was not, while the same two strains did not have the same effects on two different C. jejuni strains. We have shown a similar pattern here, although not to the same extent, in the anti-Campylobacter activity of different B. subtilis strains. Of the 15 B. subtilis strains tested, the majority (12 of 15) inhibited the growth of C. jejuni 11168 to various levels. Nevertheless, B. subtilis PS-216 had superior effects compared to all of the other B. subtilis stains tested, and thus the activity of B. subtilis PS-216 was additionally tested, and confirmed, against 15 different C. jejuni strains that originated from three different environments. Contrary to Wine et al. (2009), we observed a similar activity of PS-216 against all of the C. jejuni strains tested; i.e., all of the reductions in C. jejuni were significant regardless of the C. jejuni origin. This confirmed the broad anti-Campylobacter effects of B. subtilis PS-216 in vitro, and highlights the potential of this strain for use in high-load Campylobacter environments, such as the poultry intestinal tract.",
                "However, before a probiotic can be used commercially, it must first meet additional standards. One of these requirements is susceptibility to antibiotics, as probiotics can carry antibiotic resistance determinants that can be transferred to other residential bacteria in the gut via horizontal gene transfer, which will amplify the growing problem of antibiotic resistance (Sharma et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2017; EFSA and ECDC, 2019). Thus, it is of utmost importance that probiotics do not serve as genetic reservoirs for the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and consequently do not pose a risk to animal and human health. We tested the B. subtilis PS-216 susceptibility to antibiotics according to EFSA guidance (FEEDAP, 2012). B. subtilis PS-216 was indeed susceptible to the several antibiotics examined in this study, and therefore complies with the required probiotic standards.",
                "Additionally, to be effective, probiotic strains must reach the gut, and thus they must withstand the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract of an animal. Indeed, the spores of B. subtilis PS-216 were highly resistant to simulated conditions of the gastrointestinal tract in this study, and thus should pass through the gastrointestinal tract and into the intestine, where their action against pathogens needs to take place. On the contrary, the vegetative cells of B. subtilis PS-216 did not survive these gastric conditions, and are thus not suitable for such probiotic use. Cartman et al. (2008) showed that B. subtilis spores germinate and proliferate in the chicken intestine. Our results also suggest that B. subtilis PS-216 germinates and proliferates in the broiler intestine, as the Bacillus CFU/g counts of cecum samples at day 21 were approximately 1 log higher than in the inoculation solution. Thus, only the spores need to survive gastric conditions to have a probiotic effect.",
                "A further requirement that a potential probiotic must meet is in vivo efficacy, as the efficacy of a probiotic cannot be judged by in vitro results alone (Robyn et al., 2013; Mortada et al., 2020). Here, both the in vitro and in vivo results showed a significant reduction in Campylobacter for the treatment with B. subtilis PS-216 spores. The B. subtilis PS-216 spores were added to broiler chicken drinking water as a treatment solution: (i) Before inoculation with C. jejuni, to test this as a preventive measure; (ii) after established colonization with C. jejuni, to test this as a therapeutic measure; and (iii) continuously from day 1. This animal study yielded three important conclusions: (i) The Bacillus spore counts in the feces increased during the B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatment, but decreased after the treatment ended; (ii) continuous B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatment reduced C. jejuni in the cecum of broilers, although the preventive (Pre-treatment) and therapeutic (Post-treatment) uses of B. subtilis were not effective at the B. subtilis PS-216 spore concentration used here (106 CFU/mL water); and (iii) short-term treatment at the beginning or end of the experiment increased the broiler weights compared to the untreated controls. Previously, Latorre et al. (2014) reported that only continuous treatments of chickens with B. subtilis spores led to high spore counts in the chicken intestine. This is in line with our results, where there was a decrease in the Bacillus spore counts in feces and cecum after short-term B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatment, but a constant Bacillus spore count when the B. subtilis PS-216 spores were added continuously. An increase in Bacillus spore counts after the addition of B. subtilis spores was also shown by Ciurescu et al. (2020); however, the level of Bacillus spore counts in the treated groups in the cecum content were different from the present study. We determined Bacillus spore counts of around 107 CFU/g feces, while Latorre et al. (2014) observed lower Bacillus spore counts, of approximately 105 CFU/g feces. Interestingly, the number of Bacillus spores in the cecum was also higher than in the feces, and higher than the concentration of B. subtilis PS-216 spores added to the drinking water (i.e., the treatment solution). This suggests that the B. subtilis PS-216 spores either germinate in the intestine into vegetative cells that then die off before being passed as feces, or the B. subtilis PS-216 spores somehow accumulate in the broiler cecum. Nevertheless, the high spore counts without continuous administration were not sufficient to reduce the number of C. jejuni in the cecum of the treated broilers. Continuous treatment with B. subtilis PS-216 spores (106 CFU/mL water) resulted in a significant reduction in C. jejuni (1.2 log CFU/g feces) that was comparable to multispecies probiotics containing B. subtilis tested by Arsi et al. (2015) (up to 3 log CFU/g feces reduction), multi-strain B. subtilis probiotics tested by Aguiar et al. (2013) (from 1 to 4 log CFU/g feces reduction), and a single species B. subtilis probiotic Calsporin (Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me et al., 2016) (1.7 log CFU/g reduction). Differences in B. subtilis efficacy in broilers can be attributed to strain variability, as well as to treatment variability.",
                "One possible mechanism of anti-Campylobacter action of B. subtilis is competitive exclusion, in which the probiotic occupies the C. jejuni attachment sites in the intestine, thus preventing C. jejuni adhesion (Wine et al., 2009). B. subtilis strains have been shown before to reduce pathogens like E. coli (La Ragione et al., 2001) and Salmonella (La Ragione and Woodward, 2003) in the intestine by means of competitive exclusion. Some B. subtilis strains have been shown to promote the colonization of Lactobacillus in chicken intestine (Park et al., 2017), thereby acidifying the intestine and making it an unfriendly environment for C. jejuni. B. subtilis is also known to produce antimicrobials (Tamehiro et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2009; Efremenkova et al., 2016) that might act in the gut, although it is not clear whether these would be expressed in the broiler intestine. In previous studies, we showed that B. subtilis PS-216 can act against the reference C. jejuni NCTC 11168 strain in variable settings by producing the antimicrobial substance bacillaene (Erega et al., 2021; \u0160imunovi\u0107 et al., 2022); however, we have no data at this stage to support the hypothesis that this antimicrobial affects the survival of C. jejuni in these broiler chickens.",
                "Adding probiotics as feed/water supplements represents a good Campylobacter control strategy (Koutsoumanis et al., 2020). B. subtilis probiotics have been shown to have immunomodulatory effects in the gut and to modulate the gut microbiota (Hayashi et al., 2018), promote muscle development and meat quality (Zhou et al., 2015), and promote growth, feed conversion and body weight in chickens with potential anti-pathogenic effects, due to their good enzymatic activity (Fritts et al., 2000; Hmani et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017). Although such an intervention might increase production costs somewhat, and consequently the cost of the food on the market, it can also be a cost-effective intervention when the addition of probiotics reduces the risk of Campylobacter and simultaneously increases the growth performance (van Wagenberg et al., 2020). All of the B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatments in the present study resulted in increased body weight of these broiler chickens. Remarkably, even the 8-days treatment resulted in a significant weight improvement. Thus, this use of B. subtilis PS-216 spores offers the poultry industry different options: short-term use that can be implemented to increase the weight of broilers, and continuous use that on top of the weight increase, can also reduce C. jejuni counts and improve the safety of the food. In conclusion, our study suggests that B. subtilis PS-216 spores represent a new and attractive solution to enhance broiler chicken health and to increase poultry and food safety.",
                "To conclude, these results underline the potential of B. subtilis PS-216 spores as a treatment for improving poultry production and food safety. The anti-Campylobacter activity of B. subtilis PS-216 was demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo experiments in this study. In addition to its anti-Campylobacter activity, B. subtilis PS-216 spore treatments also increased the weight gain of the broiler chickens. Although B. subtilis might also act against other pathogenic bacteria, this was not tested in the present study, and future studies are needed to confirm the overall beneficial effects of B. subtilis PS-216 spores for enhanced poultry health and performance. In the future, it will also be necessary to evaluate the anti-Campylobacter effects of B. subtilis PS-216 under different settings, to determine its reproducibility and broader applicability as a viable intervention measure for Campylobacter in primary poultry production."
