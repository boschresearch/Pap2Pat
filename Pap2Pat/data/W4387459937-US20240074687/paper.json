    "title": "Novel Cyclic Homogeneous Oscillation Detection Method for High Accuracy and Specific Characterization of Neural Dynamics",

    "abstract": "Detecting temporal and spectral features of neural oscillations is essential to understanding dynamic brain function. Traditionally, the presence and frequency of neural oscillations are determined by identifying peaks over 1/f noise within the power spectrum. However, this approach solely operates within the frequency domain and thus cannot adequately distinguish between the fundamental frequency of a non-sinusoidal oscillation and its harmonics. Non-sinusoidal signals generate harmonics, significantly increasing the false-positive detection rate - a confounding factor in the analysis of neural oscillations. To overcome these limitations, we define the fundamental criteria that characterize a neural oscillation and introduce the Cyclic Homogeneous Oscillation (CHO) detection method that implements these criteria based on an auto-correlation approach that determines the oscillation's periodicity and fundamental frequency. We evaluated CHO by verifying its performance on simulated sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal oscillatory bursts convolved with 1/f noise. Our results demonstrate that CHO outperforms conventional techniques in accurately detecting oscillations. Specifically, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of CHO as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We further assessed CHO by testing it on electrocorticographic (ECoG, 8 subjects) and electroencephalographic (EEG, 7 subjects) signals recorded during the pre-stimulus period of an auditory reaction time task and on electrocorticographic signals (6 SEEG subjects and 6 ECoG subjects) collected during resting state. In the reaction time task, the CHO method detected auditory alpha and pre-motor beta oscillations in ECoG signals and occipital alpha and pre-motor beta oscillations in EEG signals. Moreover, CHO determined the fundamental frequency of hippocampal oscillations in the human hippocampus during the resting state (6 SEEG subjects). In summary, CHO demonstrates high precision and specificity in detecting neural oscillations in time and frequency domains. The method's specificity enables the detailed study of non-sinusoidal characteristics of oscillations, such as the degree of asymmetry and waveform of an oscillation. Furthermore, CHO can be applied to identify how neural oscillations govern interactions throughout the brain and to determine oscillatory biomarkers that index abnormal brain function.",

                "Neural oscillations in the mammalian brain are thought to play an important role in coordinating neural activity across different brain regions, allowing for the integration of sensory information, 1 of 23 the control of motor movements, and the maintenance of cognitive functions (Pfurtscheller and Da Silva, 1999;Caplan et al., 2003;Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004;Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010;Giraud and Poeppel, 2012;Schalk, 2015;Fries, 2015). Detecting neural oscillations is important in neuroscience as it helps unravel the mysteries of brain function, understand brain disorders, investigate cognitive processes, track neurodevelopment, develop brain-computer interfaces, and explore new therapeutic approaches. Thus, detecting and analyzing the \"when\", the \"where\", and the \"what\" of neural oscillations is an essential step in understanding the processes that govern neural oscillations.",
                "For example, detecting the onset and offset of a neural oscillation (i.e., the \"when\") is necessary to understand the relationship between oscillatory power/phase and neural excitation, an essential step in explaining an oscillation's excitatory or inhibitory function (Pfurtscheller and Da Silva, 1999;Canolty et al., 2006;Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010;Haegens et al., 2011;de Pesters et al., 2016).",
                "Localizing the brain area or layer that generates the oscillation (i.e., the \"where\") provides neuroanatomical relevance to cognitive and behavioral functions (Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004;Miller et al., 2010). Lastly, determining the oscillation's fundamental frequency (i.e., the \"what\") indicates underlying brain states (Penfield and Jasper, 1954;Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004). Together, the \"when\", the \"where\", and the \"what\" can be seen as the fundamental pillars in investigating the role of oscillations in interregional communication throughout the brain (Fries, 2015). These fundamental pillars can also provide insight into the functional purpose (i.e., the \"why\"), underlying mechanisms (i.e., the \"how\"), and pathologies (i.e., the \"whom\") of neural oscillations (Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004;Buzsaki, 2006).",
                "The detection of neural oscillations has historically been extensively studied in the frequency- (Wen and Liu, 2016;Donoghue et al., 2020;Ostlund et al., 2022), time- (Hughes et al., 2012;Gips et al., 2017), and time-frequency domains (Chen et al., 2011;Wilson et al., 2022;Neymotin et al., 2022). With the notable exception of Gips et al. 2017, these studies assume that neural oscillations are predominantly sinusoidal and stationary in their frequency. However, there is an increasing realization that neural oscillations are actually non-sinusoidal and exhibit spurious phase-amplitude coupling (Belluscio et al., 2012;Cole et al., 2017;Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort, 2016;Gips et al., 2017;Donoghue et al., 2022). A recent review paper on methodological issues in analyzing neural oscillations (Donoghue et al., 2022) identified determining the fundamental frequency of non-sinusoidal neural oscillations as the most challenging problem in building an understanding of how neural oscillations govern interactions throughout the brain.",
                "Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is the most commonly used method to detect neural oscillations.",
                "The FFT separates a neural signal into sinusoidal components within canonical bands of the frequency spectrum (e.g., theta, alpha, beta). The components of these canonical bands are typically considered to be functionally independent and involved in different brain functions. However, when applied to non-sinusoidal neural signals, the FFT produces harmonic phase-locked components at multiples of the fundamental frequency. While the asymmetric nature of the fundamental oscillation can be of great physiological relevance (Mazaheri and Jensen, 2008;Cole et al., 2017;Donoghue et al., 2022), its harmonics are considered to be an artifact produced by the FFT that can confound the detection and physiological interpretation of neural oscillation (Belluscio et al., 2012;Donoghue et al., 2022).",
                "An example of an unfiltered electrocorticographic recording from auditory cortex (Figure 1A) illustrates the non-sinusoidal nature of neural oscillations. The associated FFT-based power spectrum (Figure 1B) exhibits multiple peaks over 1/f noise even though only one oscillatory signal is visibly present in the time domain signal. Whether the peaks over 1/f at 12 and 18 Hz, are harmonics of 6 Hz oscillations or independent oscillations remains unknown. This ambiguity affects the ability to accurately and efficiently identify neural oscillations and understand their role in cognition and behavior. For this illustrative example of non-sinusoidal neural oscillation, we used a phase-phase coupling analysis (Belluscio et al., 2012) to determine whether the exhibited 18 Hz beta oscillation is a harmonic of the 6 Hz theta oscillation. This analysis confirmed that the beta os-cillation was indeed a harmonic of the theta oscillation (Figure 1E andF). In marked contrast, for a sinusoidal neural oscillation, a phase-phase coupling analysis could not fully ascertain whether the oscillations are phase-locked and thus are harmonics of each other (Figure 1G-L). This ambiguity, combined with the exorbitant computational complexity of the entailed permutation test and the requirement to perform the analysis across all cross-frequency bands over all channels and trials render phase-phase coupling impracticable for determining the fundamental frequency of neural oscillations in real-time and, thus, the use in closed-loop neuromodulation applications.",
                "In this study, we aim to define the principle criteria that characterize a neural oscillation and to synthesize these criteria into a method that accurately determines the duration (\"when\"), location (\"where\"), and fundamental frequency (\"what\") of non-sinusoidal neural oscillations. For this purpose, we introduce the Cyclic Homogeneous Oscillation (CHO) detection method to identify neural oscillations using an auto-correlation analysis to identify whether a neural oscillation is an independent oscillation or a harmonic of another oscillation. Auto-correlation is a statistical measure that assesses the degree of similarity between a time series and a delayed version of itself.",
                "Thus, auto-correlation can explain the periodicity of a signal without assuming that the signal is sinusoidal. Further, the peaks in the output of the auto-correlation function indicate the fundamental frequency of the neural oscillation. As shown in Figure 2, irrespective of the shape of neural oscillation (Figure 2A andC), the fundamental frequency can be determined from the positive peak-to-peak intervals (see Figure 2B andD). Despite auto-correlation being a well-known method to identify the fundamental frequency of a signal, its application to neural oscillations has been impeded by the requirement to accurately determine the onset and offset of the oscillation.",
                "To overcome this limitation, we combine the auto-correlation method with the Oscillation Event (OEvent) method (Neymotin et al., 2022) to determine the onset/offset of oscillations. In this approach, OEvent determines bounding boxes in the time-frequency domain that mark the onset and offset of suspected oscillations. Each bounding box is generated by identifying a period of significantly increased power from averaged power spectrum. To further improve OEvent, we replaced the empirical threshold that identifies bounding boxes in the time-frequency domain with a parametric threshold driven by an estimation of the underlying 1/f noise (Donoghue et al., 2020) In the final step, we determine the oscillation's periodicity and fundamental frequency by identifying positive peaks in the auto-correlation of the signal. As shown for a representative oscillation in Figure 3C, the center frequency of the highlighted bounding box is 24 Hz, but the periodicity of the underlying raw signal does not match the calculated fundamental frequency of 7 Hz. Consequently, this bounding box at 24 Hz will be rejected. Finally, we merge those remaining bounding boxes that neighbor each other in the frequency domain and overlap more than 75% (Neymotin et al., 2022) in time.",
                "In summary, the presented CHO method identifies neural oscillations that fulfill the following three criteria: 1) oscillations (peaks over 1/f noise) must be present in the time and frequency domains; 2) oscillations must exhibit at least two full cycles; and 3) oscillations must have autocorrelation. These criteria are supported by studies in the neuroscience literature (Buzsaki and Draguhn, 2004;Niedermeyer and da Silva, 2005;Buzsaki, 2006;Cohen, 2014;de Cheveign\u00e9 and Nelken, 2019;Donoghue et al., 2020Donoghue et al., , 2022)). The synthesis of these criteria into the presented method allows us to detect and identify non-sinusoidal oscillations and their fundamental frequency. This is because criteria #1 (i.e., the presence of an oscillation) and #2 (i.e., the length of the oscillation) identify potential oscillations, which are then tested to be fundamental oscillations using an auto-correlation analysis using criteria #3 (i.e., the periodicity of an oscillation). Detecting the presence, onset/offset, and fundamental frequency of non-sinusoidal oscillations is challenging. This is because the power spectrum of the non-sinusoidal theta-band oscillation (A) exhibits multiple harmonic peaks in the alpha and beta bands (B). The peaks of these harmonics are also exhibited in the time-frequency domain (C). To determine whether these peaks are independent oscillations or harmonics of the fundamental frequency, we tested whether fundamental theta oscillation and potential beta-band harmonic oscillations exhibit a 1:3 phase-locking (D-F), i.e., whether the beta-band oscillation is a true 3rd harmonic of the fundamental theta-band oscillation. In our test, we found that the theta-band oscillation was significantly phase-locked to the beta-band oscillation with a 1:3 ratio in their frequencies (F). This means that the tested theta-and beta-band oscillations are part of one single non-sinusoidal neural oscillation. We applied the same statistical test to a sinusoidal neural oscillation (G). Since this neural oscillation closely assembles a sinusoidal shape, it does not exhibit any prominent harmonic peaks in the alpha and beta bands within the power spectrum (H) and time-frequency domain (I). Consequently, our test found that the phase of the theta-band and beta-band oscillations were not phase-locked (J-L). This means that the tested oscillation is a sinusoidal neural theta-band oscillation.",
                "To verify and validate CHO, we applied the above-presented principle criteria on simulated nonsinusoidal signals and human electrophysiological signals, including electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals recorded from the lateral brain surface, electroencephalographic signals (EEG) recorded from the scalp, and local field potentials recorded from the hippocampus using stereo EEG (SEEG).",
                "We further validated our approach by comparing CHO to other commonly used methods.",
                "To determine the spectral accuracy in detecting the peak frequency of non-sinusoidal oscil- Moreover, to determine the spectro-temporal accuracy in detecting both the peak frequency and the onset/offset of non-sinusoidal oscillations, we compared CHO with the OEvent method.",
                "The selection of FOOOF, SPRiNT, and OEvent is based on their fundamental approaches. To the best of our knowledge, FOOOF is the most representative method for detecting the peak frequency of neural oscillations. SPRiNT expands the FOOOF method into the time-frequency domain, and OEvent can determine the onset/offset of the detected oscillations. "

The rightmost panel of Figure 4A shows two examples of non-sinusoidal oscillations (two-and-a-half cycles and 2s-duration) along with their power spectra. As can be seen in Figure 4A, longer non-sinusoidal oscillations exhibit stronger harmonic peaks.",
                        "Our results in Figure 4B-D demonstrate that CHO outperforms conventional techniques in specificity and accuracy for detecting the peak frequency of non-sinusoidal oscillations. High specificity depends on high true-negative and low false-positive rates. For conventional methods, we expected harmonic oscillations to increase the false-positive rate and one-cycled oscillations to decrease the true-negative rate. As expected, conventional methods detected harmonic and onecycled oscillations as true oscillations. For example, the average specificity of SPRiNT was below 0.3, which was significantly lower than the robust specificity of CHO across the entire range of SNR.",
                        "We also observed that CHO requires a higher SNR to detect the presence of oscillations. Sensitivity depends on the true-positive and the false-negative rates. We found existing methods to be overly sensitive in detecting the presence of oscillations. At the same time, this severely limits their specificity and, thus, their ability to accurately detect the presence and frequency of an oscillation.",

When tested at these physiologicallymotivated SNR levels, and found that the sensitivity of CHO is comparable to that of SPRiNT. Overall, when considering the accuracy combined with specificity and sensitivity, CHO outperformed all other methods in detecting the peak frequency of non-sinusoidal oscillations at the physiologicallymotivated SNR levels.",

This comparison is limited to OEvent because FOOOF and SPRiNT methods cannot determine the onset and offset of short oscillations. In this analysis, CHO outperformed the OEvent method in specificity but not sensitivity, as shown in Figure 4E-G. Specifically, we found performance trends similar to those in our previous simulation result (Figure 4B-D). Thus, CHO outperforms conventional techniques in specificity for detecting both the peak frequency and onset/offset of oscillations."

For this purpose, we tested whether CHO, applied to signals recorded from auditory cortex during an auditory reaction-time task, can accurately detect the transition between resting and task periods. Specifically, we expected CHO to detect the offset times of neural oscillations after the stimulus onset (i.e., a beep tone that remained until a button was pressed). Based on the principle of event-related de-/synchronization (ERD/ERS, Pfurtscheller and Da Silva 1999), cortical neurons may be de-synchronized to process an auditory stimulus. As shown in Figure 7, CHO successfully detected offset times of 7 Hz neural oscillations. During the pre-stimulus period, the distribution of the onset time remains uniform, reflecting the subject waiting for the stimulus. In contrast, after the stimulus onset, the distribution of onset times becomes Gaussian, reflecting the variable reaction time to the auditory stimulus. Of note, the detection of onset times peaks 950 ms post-stimulus, which occurs significantly later than the button press that happens 200 ms post-stimulus (Figure 7B).",

The first criterion was that neural oscillations (peaks over 1/f noise) must be present in the time and frequency domain. The 1/f trend estimation served as a threshold to reject aperiodic oscillatory power in the neural signals (Donoghue et al., 2020).     Next, the second condition was that oscillations must exhibit at least two complete cycles. This condition distinguishes periodic oscillations from evoked/event-related potentials (EP/ERP) and spike artifacts. EP/ERP have spectral characteristics that are similar to those of theta or alpha frequency oscillations. To discriminate EP/ERPs from genuine oscillations, we reject them if they don't exhibit peaks over 1/f or if they have fewer than two cycles.",
                        "The third and final condition is that oscillations should share the same periodicity as their autocorrelation. This is because positive peaks in the auto-correlation can identify the oscillation's fundamental frequency even if it is non-sinusoidal. The bounding boxes help us to identify possible onsets/offsets of neural oscillations. Moreover, calculating the auto-correlation of the raw signals within a bounding box provides the true periodic frequency of the raw signal. We then reject any bounding boxes for which the periodicity of the raw signal is not in alignment with the true periodic frequency revealed by the auto-correlation. This third condition is important in rejecting harmonic peaks over 1/f noise in the frequency domain. Furthermore, it is also effective in rejecting spurious oscillations, which are broadly generated by spike activities in the frequency domain (de Cheveign\u00e9 and Nelken, 2019).",
                        "To calculate the auto-correlation, we first needed to determine the onset/offset of the potential oscillations. The first and second criteria serve as a triage in finding the onset/offset of genuine oscillations. Thus, these three principle criteria were essential to reject aperiodic harmonic oscillations and increase CHO's specificity in detecting both the peak frequency and the onset/offset of non-sinusoidal oscillations. We also evaluated CHO on purely sinusoidal oscillations (see figure",
                        "Supplement 2). The results of this analysis show that even in the absence of any asymmetry in the oscillations, CHO still outperforms existing methods in specificity. It further shows that the sensitivity increases with increasing SNR. Even though this analysis is based on synthetic sinusoidal oscillations, our results demonstrated that existing methods are susceptible to noise which results in the detection of spurious oscillations. However, as expected, both FOOOF and SPRiNT methods exhibited reasonable specificity when applied to sinusoidal signals."

In the motor cortex, beta oscillations are thought to be involved in motor planning and execution. Studies have shown that beta oscillations increase and decrease in power during movement preparation and movement execution, respectively (Pfurtscheller and Da Silva, 1999;Jenkinson and Brown, 2011;Doyle et al., 2005;Senkowski et al., 2006). In our empirical results based on the presented ECoG dataset, CHO found focal beta oscillations to occur within pre-motor and frontal cortex prior to the button response, as shown in Figure 5. These findings were consistent across subjects. Conventional methods found alpha and beta oscillations in the auditory cortex, while CHO found only select beta oscillations. This suggests that most of the beta oscillations detected by conventional methods are simply harmonics of the predominant asymmetric alpha oscillation. Along the same line, conventional methods found beta and low gamma oscillations in pre-motor and frontal areas, while CHO found predominantly beta oscillations. This suggests that low gamma oscillations detected by conventional methods are harmonics of beta oscillations.",

Similar to the ECoG results, our analysis confirmed that non-sinusoidal alpha and beta oscillations generate harmonic oscillations in both beta and low gamma in EEG. This shows that our CHO method, which has a high specificity, can detect focal motor beta oscillations."

This realization stems from the recognition that neural oscillations are non-sinusoidal, and thus require a wide frequency band to be fully captured (Cole and Voytek, 2019;Donoghue et al., 2022). Adopting a wider frequency band provides more frequency options in fitting the non-sinusoidal shape of brain waves. The recognition of the need to expand the frequency band within oscillation analysis is not limited to the hippocampus. Our ECoG and EEG results show that harmonics can occur in any brain area and frequency band because neural oscillations are inherently non-sinusoidal. A recent study showed that the phase of wide-band oscillations could better predict neural firing (Davis et al., 2020).",

Using CHO, the onset/offset, and duration of neural oscillations can be revealed, as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 9. Knowing the onset/offset and duration of a neural oscillation is essential for realizing closed-loop neuromodulation. This is because neuromodulation may be most efficient when electrical stimulation is delivered phase-locked to the underlying ongoing oscillation (Chen et al., 2011;Cagnan et al., 2017Cagnan et al., , 2019;;Zanos et al., 2018;Shirinpour et al., 2020). For example, deep-brain stimulation in phase with ongoing oscillation can reduce the stimulation necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect (Cagnan et al., 2017(Cagnan et al., , 2019)). This improved efficiency in delivering the stimulation therapy reduces power consumption and thus enhances the battery life of the implanted system (Chen et al., 2011). Longer battery life means fewer battery changes (which require surgical procedures), or for rechargeable systems, fewer recharging sessions (which require the user's attention). Realizing phase-locked neuromodulation requires detecting the duration of an ongoing oscillation with high specificity and delivering the electrical stimulation at a predicted oscillation phase. The detection and identification with high specificity thus enable neuromodulation applications that depend on phase-locked electrical stimulation.",

For example, a neurofeedback system may provide targeted feedback on the magnitude of the user's alpha oscillation to improve attention and in turn improve task performance. For this purpose, the system must detect the frequency, onset/offset, and duration of the user's alpha oscillation with high specificity. High specificity requires distinguishing other oscillations and artifacts from true physiological alpha-band oscillations. The identification of true neural oscillations with the high specificity of CHO thus enables targeted neurofeedback applications to enhance or restore task performance."

We found the same inhibitory oscillatory phenomenon over the auditory cortex, however, with a fundamental frequency of 7 Hz, indicating functional independence between inhibitory oscillations found in visual, motor, and auditory cortex (see Figure 7C andD). The approach presented in this study could be expanded to studying attention, memory, decision-making, and more by correlating neural oscillations with specific cognitive processes.

To investigate whether this is an issue in real-world applications, we determined the averaged SNR of alpha oscillations in EEG (-7 dB)",

Currently, CHO uses a Hilbert transform method rather than Wavelet or short-time fast Fourier transform (STFFT) because it is easy to implement in MATLAB and provides better control over the spectral shape (i.e., better accuracy in detecting peak frequency of oscillations, Cohen 2014). Despite the theoretical advantages of wavelet over Hilbert transform, in developing our CHO method, we found no significant differences when we used different approaches to estimate the time-frequency map. This finding is further supported by a comparative study shown by Bruns in 2004.",

When we performed each detection step within CHO, as shown in Figure 3, we captured oscillations in a low-SNR situation. However, applying the third criterion rejected many possible bounding boxes. Thus, developing a better conceptual framework to reject harmonic peaks in the spectral domain may decrease the false-negative rate and, in turn, increase the sensitivity in low-SNR situations."

Oscillations (peaks over 1/f noise) must be present in the time and frequency domain. 2. Oscillations must exhibit at least two full cycles. 3. The periodicity of an oscillation is the fundamental frequency of the oscillation. The procedural steps of CHO adhere to these principle criteria, as shown in Figure 3. First, we apply a time-frequency analysis to determine power changes for each frequency component over time. To measure the significant spectral power increase over the time domain, we use the 1/f fitting technique as the principal threshold. In other words, the proposed method only considers those oscillations that emerge above the underlying 1/f noise. Thus, any oscillation with smaller power than 1/f noise is not considered to be an oscillation. To accomplish this, we subtract the underlying 1/f noise within the time-frequency domain. Specifically, we divide the time domain into four periods and estimate the minimum 1/f aperiodic fit across these periods. After the subtraction of the underlying 1/f noise, we calculate the averaged power difference between the signal and the 1/f noise (named sigma).",

This restriction allows CHO to distinguish oscillations from confounding eventrelated potentials (ERPs) or evoked potentials (EPs). In general, the frequency characteristics of those potentials often overlap with neural oscillations (e.g., theta power of ERPs and theta power of theta rhythm). However, ERPs or EPs never exhibit more than two cycles. Therefore, we reject those bounding boxes that exhibit less than two cycles. An example is shown in Figure 3B.",

Non-sinusoidal signals are known to exhibit harmonics in the frequency domain, significantly increasing the false-positive detection rate -the confounding factor addressed by CHO's third criterion. The power spectrum of the non-sinusoidal oscillations has additional harmonic peaks over 1/f noise, even though the periodicity of the signal does not match the harmonic peak frequency. Therefore, the positive peaks of the oscillation's autocorrelation represent the oscillation's periodicity and fundamental frequency. As shown in Figure 3C, the center frequency of the bounding box is 24 Hz, but the periodicity of the raw signal within the bounding box does not match 7 Hz. Consequently, this bounding box will be rejected.",

Of note, the smaller the Turkey ratio within the taper section, the higher the occurrence of high-frequency artifacts.",
                        "To evaluate the performance of CHO, we calculated the specificity and sensitivity of CHO in detecting non-sinusoidal oscillations. High specificity depends on high true-negative and low falsepositive detection rates. In contrast, high sensitivity depends on high true-positive and low falsenegative detection rates. In this simulation, we expected harmonic oscillations to increase the falsepositive detection rate, and one-cycled oscillations to decrease the true-negative detection rate within conventional methods. Thus, harmonic oscillations and one-cycled oscillations decrease the specificity, not sensitivity.",
                        "For evaluating the performance of each method in determining the fundamental frequency of the oscillations, we defined an accurate detection as one that exhibited a difference between the ground truth peak frequency and detected frequency of less than 1.5 Hz. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of each method in detecting the onset/offset of the oscillations, we calculated the correlation between the envelope of the ground truth oscillation and the detected oscillation. We defined those onset/offset detections as accurate if the correlation was positive and the p-value was smaller than 0.05.   "

                        "In total, the subjects performed between 134 and 580 trials. Throughout each trial, the subjects were first required to fixate and gaze at the screen in front of them. Next, a visual cue indicated the trial's start, followed by a random 1-3 s pre-stimulus interval and, subsequently, the auditory stimulus. The stimulus was terminated by the subject's button press or after a 2-s time out, after which the subject received feedback about his/her reaction time. This feedback motivated the subjects to respond as quickly as possible to the stimulus. We penalized subjects with a warning tone to prevent false starts if they responded too fast (i.e., less than 100 ms after stimulus onset).",
                        "We excluded false-start trials from our analysis. We were interested in this task's auditory and motor responses in this study. This required defining the onset of these two responses. We timelocked our analysis of the auditory response to the onset of the auditory stimulus (as measured by the voltage between the sound port on the PC and the loudspeaker). For the motor response, we time-locked our analysis to the time when the push button was pressed. To ensure the temporal accuracy of these two onset markers, we sampled them simultaneously with the EEG/ECoG signals using dedicated inputs in our biosignal acquisition systems. We defined baseline and task periods for the auditory and motor response. Specifically, we used the 0.5-s period prior to the stimulus onset as the baseline for the auditory response and the 1-s to 0.5-s period prior to the button press as the baseline for the motor response. Similarly, we used the 1-s period after stimulus onset as the task period for the auditory response and the period from 0.5-s before to 0.5-s after the button press as the task period for the motor task.
