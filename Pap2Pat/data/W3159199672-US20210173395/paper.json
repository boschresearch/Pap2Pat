    "date": "2021-05-19",
    "abstract": "Deploying deep reinforcement learning in safety-critical settings requires developing algorithms that obey hard constraints during exploration. This paper contributes a first approach toward enforcing formal safety constraints on end-to-end policies with visual inputs. Our approach draws on recent advances in object detection and automated reasoning for hybrid dynamical systems. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of safely exploring in the presence of hard constraints. Our benchmark draws from several proposed problem sets for safe learning and includes problems that emphasize challenges such as reward signals that are not aligned with safety constraints. On each of these benchmark problems, our algorithm completely avoids unsafe behavior while remaining competitive at optimizing for as much reward as is safe. We characterize safety constraints in terms of a refinement relation on Markov decision processes - rather than directly constraining the reinforcement learning algorithm so that it only takes safe actions, we instead refine the environment so that only safe actions are defined in the environment's transition structure. This has pragmatic system design benefits and, more importantly, provides a clean conceptual setting in which we are able to prove important safety and efficiency properties. These allow us to transform the constrained optimization problem of acting safely in the original environment into an unconstrained optimization in a refined environment.",

                "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms [46] are effective at learning, often from raw sensor inputs, control policies that optimize for a quantitative reward signal. Learning these policies can require experiencing millions of unsafe actions. Even if a safe policy is finally learned -which will happen only if the reward signal reflects all relevant safety priorities -providing a purely statistical guarantee that the optimal policy is safe requires an unrealistic amount of training data [24]. The difficulty of establishing the safety of these algorithms makes it difficult to justify the use of reinforcement learning in safety-critical domains where industry standards demand strong evidence of safety prior to deployment [23].",
                "Formal verification provides a rigorous way of establishing safety for traditional control systems [5]. The problem of providing formal guarantees in RL is called formally constrained reinforcement learning (FCRL). Existing FCRL methods such as [2, 7, 10, 15-17, 19, 20, 35] combine the best of both worlds: they optimize for a reward function while safely exploring the environment.",
                "Existing FCRL methods suffer from two significant disadvantages that detract from their real-world applicability: a) they enforce constraints over a completely symbolic state space that is assumed to be noiseless (e.g. the position of the safety-relevant objects are extracted from a simulator's internal state); b) they assume that the entire reward structure depends upon the same symbolic state-space used to enforce formal constraints. The first assumption limits the applicability of FCRL in real-world settings where the system's state must be inferred by an imperfect and perhaps even untrusted perception system. The second assumption implies a richer symbolic state that includes a symbolic representation of the reward, which we argue is unnecessary and may require more labelled data. Furthermore, this means these approaches may not generalize across different environments that have similar safety concerns, but completely different reward structures.",
                "The goal of this paper is to safely learn a safe policy without assuming a perfect oracle that identifies the positions of all safetyrelevant objects. I.e., unlike all existing FCRL methods, we do not rely on the internal state of the simulator. Prior to reinforcement learning, we train an object detection system to extract from RGB images the 2D positions of safety-relevant objects up to a certain precision. The pre-trained object detection system is used during reinforcement learning to extract the positions of safety-relevant objects, and that information is then used to enforce formal safety constraints. Absolute safety in the presence of untrusted perception is epistemologically challenging, but our formal safety constraints do at least account for a type of noise commonly found in object detection systems. Finally, although our system (called Verifiably Safe Reinforcement Learning, or VSRL) uses a few labeled data to pre-train the object detection, we still learn an end-to-end policy that may leverage the entire visual observation for reward optimization.",
                "Prior work from the formal methods community has demonstrated that safe RL is possible with full symbolic characterization of the environment and precise observations of the entire state. However, this is not realistic for actual robotic systems which have to interact with the physical world and can only perceive it through an imperfect visual system. This paper demonstrates that techniques inspired by formal methods can provide value even in this situation. First, we show that by using existing vision techniques to bridge between the visual input and the symbolic representation, one can leverage formal techniques to achieve highly robust behavior. Under certain assumptions on the vision system, we prove that our approach will learn safely. Second, we propose a new method of enforcing constraints which refines the environment instead of the learning algorithm. We prove that all policies are safe in this refined environment and that learning in this refined environment preserves expected rewards.",
                "We also show that our method is capable of optimizing for reward even when significant aspects of the reward structure are not extracted as high-level features used for safety checking. Our experiments demonstrate that VSRL is capable of optimizing for reward structure related to objects whose positions we do not extract via supervised training. This is significant because it means that VSRL needs pre-trained object detectors only for objects that are safetyrelevant.",
                "Finally, we provide a novel benchmark suite for Safe Exploration in Reinforcement Learning that includes both environments where the reward signal is aligned with the safety objectives and environments where the reward-optimal policy is unsafe. Our motivation for the latter is that assuming reward-optimal policies respect hard safety constraints neglects one of the fundamental challenges of Safe RL: preventing \"reward-hacking\". For example, it is fundamentally difficult to tune a reward signal so that it has the \"correct\" trade-off between a pedestrian's life and battery efficiency. We show that in the environments where the reward-optimal policy is safe (\"rewardaligned\"), VSRL learns a safe policy with convergence rates and final rewards which are competitive or even superior to the baseline method. More importantly, VSRL learns these policies with zero safety violations during training; i.e., it achieves perfectly safe exploration. In the environment where the reward-optimal policy is unsafe (\"reward-misaligned\"), VSRL successfully avoids \"reward-hacking\" by violating safety constraints, optimizing only for the subset of reward that can be achieved without violating safety constraints.",
                "Summarily, this paper contributes: (1) VSRL, a new approach toward formally constrained reinforcement learning that makes more realistic assumptions about access to symbolic features. This approach requires minimal supervision before reinforcement learning begins and explores safely while remaining competitive at optimizing for reward. (2) a new method of enforcing safety constraints by refining the environment so all policies are safe while preserving expected rewards (3) a novel benchmark suite for safe exploration in reinforcement learning with hard constraints that includes both properly specified and mis-specified reward signals."

This assumption is reasonable whenever accurate dynamical models of the system under control are available, which is often the case in traditional control systems. The success of model-based approaches toward controller design provides evidence for the reasonableness of this assumption. Notice that the model only needs to accurately describe safety-relevant portions of the environment's dynamics; in particular, we make no assumption about the accuracy of the plant model for potions of the state space that aren't relevant to safety. This paper assumes accurate environmental models are given; learning or repairing a model of the environment during exploration is an interesting direction for future work."

The XO environment, visualized in Figure 2(a), contains three types of objects: X objects that must be collected (+1 reward), O objects that must be avoided (-1 reward), and the agent (marked by a +). There is also a small penalty (-0.01) at each step to encourage rapid collection of all Xs and completion of the episode. This environment provides a simple baseline for evaluating VSRL. It is also simple to modify and extend, which we use to evaluate the ability of VSRL to generalize safe policies to environments that deviate slightly from implicit modeling assumptions. The symbolic state space includes the position of the + and the O, but not the position of the Xs because they are not safety-relevant. The purpose of this benchmark is to provide a benchmark for safe exploration in a simple discrete setting.",

Unlike the 2D goal-finding environment, hitting an obstacle does not end the episode. Instead, the obstacle is removed from the environment and a random number of new pointmesses spawn in its place. Notice that this means that the agent may reward hack by taking an unsafe action (hitting an obstacle) and then cleaning up the resulting pointmesses. We consider this the incorrect behavior. We use the verified model from [32] to constrain the agent's dynamics.",

VSRL is able to perfectly preserve safety in all environments from the beginning of training even with the \ud835\udf16-bounded errors in extracting the symbolic features from the images. In contrast, vanilla PPO takes many unsafe actions while training and does not always converge to a policy that entirely avoids unsafe objects by the end of training.",

In the ACC environment, in particular, it is very easy to learn a safe policy which is reward-optimal. In the GF and PM environments, both the baseline agent and the VSRL agent struggle to learn to perform the task well (note that these tasks are quite difficult because encountering an obstacle ends the episode).

                "Recently, there has been a growing interest in safe RL, especially in the context of safe exploration, where the agent has to be safe also during training. A naive approach to RL safety is reward shaping, in which one defines a penalty cost for unsafe actions. This approach has several drawbacks, e.g. the choice of the penalty is brittle, so a naive choice may not outweigh a shorter path to the reward, as shown by Dalal et al. [6]. Therefore, recent work on safe RL addresses the challenge of providing reward-agnostic safety guarantees for Table 2. Final reward (R; higher is better) and total number of unsafe actions (U; lower is better) on all environments. All results are the median over at least 4 replicates.",
                "deep RL [12,47]. Many recent safe exploration methods focus on safety guarantees that hold in expectation (e.g., [1,44]) or with high probability (e.g., [3,4,6,25]. Some of these approaches achieve impressive results by drawing upon techniques from control theory, such as Lyapunov functions [3] and control barrier certificates. On the other hand, ensuring safety in expectation or with high probability is generally not sufficient in safety-critical settings where guarantees must hold always, even for rare and measure-zero events. Numerical testing alone cannot provide such guarantees in practice [24] or even in theory [41]. The problem of providing formal guarantees in RL is called formally constrained reinforcement learning (FCRL). Existing FCRL methods such as [2,7,10,15,[17][18][19][20]35] combine the best of both worlds: they optimize for a reward function while still providing formal safety guarantees. While most FCRL method can only ensure the safety in discrete-time environments known a priori, Fulton and Platzer [10,11] introduce Justified Speculative Control, which exploits Differential Dynamic Logic [39] to prove the safety of hybrid systems, systems that combine an agent's discrete-time decisions with a continuous time dynamics of the system.",
                "A major drawback of current FCRL methods is that they only learn control policies over handcrafted symbolic state spaces. Relative to Fulton and Platzer [10,11], our primary contribution is that we learn end-to-end policies instead of assuming that an oracle extracts a state-space from visual inputs. This has two advantagesunlike the approach in Fulton and Platzer [10,11], VSRL considers the challenge of imperfect perception and is able optimize for latent features that are not in the symbolic safety model's state space. Similarly, while many methods extract a symbolic mapping for RL from visual data, e.g. [13,14,27,28,30,31,48,49], they all require that all of the reward-relevant features are explicitly represented in the symbolic space. As shown by the many successes of Deep RL, e.g. [34], handcrafted features often miss important signals hidden in the raw data.",
                "Our approach aims at combining the best of FCRL and end-to-end RL to ensure that exploration is always safe with formal guarantees, while allowing a deep RL algorithm to fully exploit the visual inputs for reward optimization."

                "Safe exploration in the presence of hard safety constraints is a challenging problem in reinforcement learning. We contribute VSRL, an approach toward safe learning on visual inputs. Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, this paper establishes that VSRL maintains perfect safety during exploration while obtaining comparable reward. Because VSRL separates safety-critical object detection from RL, next steps should include applying tools from adversarial robustness to the object detectors used by VSRL."
