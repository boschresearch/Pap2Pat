    "title": "Development of a broad spectrum glycoconjugate vaccine to prevent wound and disseminated infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa",
    "date": "2018-09-06",
    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are important human pathogens that are associated with a range of infection types, including wound and disseminated infections. Treatment has been complicated by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Immunoprophylactic strategies are not constrained by antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Vaccines against these organisms would be important public health tools, yet they are not available. KP surface O polysaccharides (OPS) are protective antigens in animal models of infection. Similarly, PA flagellin (Fla), the major subunit of the flagellar filament, is required for virulence and is a target of protective antibodies in animal models. We report herein the development of a combined KP and PA glycoconjugate vaccine comprised of the four most common KP OPS types associated with human infections (O1, O2, O3, O5), chemically linked to the two Fla types of PA (FlaA, FlaB). Conjugation of KP OPS to PA Fla enhanced anti-polysaccharide immune responses and produced a formulation that generated antibody titers to the four KP OPS types and both PA Fla antigens in rabbits. Passive transfer of vaccine-induced rabbit antisera reduced the bacterial burden and protected mice against fatal intravenous KP infection. Mice passively transferred with conjugate-induced antisera were also protected against PA infection after thermal injury with a FlaB-expressing isolate, but not a FlaA isolate. Taken together, these promising preclinical results provide important proof-of-concept for a broad spectrum human vaccine to prevent KP and PA infections.",

                "Nosocomial infections are a major risk factor upon hospitalization and are associated with a range of infections including those at surgical sites and wounds, pneumonias, intravenous catheter-based infections, urinary tract infections, and septicemia. The recent emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among nosocomially-associated bacteria, including to antibiotics of last resort such as colistin, engenders significant clinical risk and threatens a return to the pre-antibiotic era. Two Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), account for a significant proportion of nosocomial infections and have been identified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization as being of highest concern due to the accelerating acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance [1, 2]. Vaccine approaches are not subject to the evasion mechanisms mediating resistance to antibiotics, and thus represent a promising adjunct approach toward ameliorating the burden of AMR bacterial infections [3, 4]. There are, however, no licensed human vaccines for KP and PA. As the clinico-epidemiological patterns for nosocomial infections with these pathogens are similar, a broad spectrum vaccine is warranted and would offer a potentially straightforward way to reduce their combined incidence [1].",
                "Among the different PA antigens that have been assessed as potential vaccinogens, PA flagella proteins are among the best studied, where they have been documented as essential virulence factors and protective antigens in animal models of burn wound and pneumonia infections [5]. Pathogenic PA express a single polar flagellum that is comprised primarily as a multimer of the single protein flagellin (Fla) for which there are only two known serotypes termed FlaA (including sub-forms A1 and A2) and FlaB [6]. Antibodies directed against Fla proteins have arrested motility, and protected mice against fatal PA infection when induced by active immunization or passively transferred [7, 8]. As immunity has been found to be serotype-specific to either FlaA or FlaB, a broadly protective PA vaccine would require coverage for both antigens [7].",
                "While comparatively less effort has been directed towards development of a KP vaccine due to historical susceptibility to antibiotics, preclinical studies have documented the capacity of antibodies directed against KP surface polysaccharides to protect against lethal KP challenge in animal models [9]. KP can express both a capsule polysaccharide (K antigen) and a lipopolysaccharide-associated O polysaccharide (OPS) on their surface. There are, however, greater than 80 known KP capsular serotypes for which no single K type predominates and notable geographical disparities exist for the most common circulating types [10, 11]. It has thus been estimated that a broadly protective vaccine would require coverage for at least 24 different K types representing a notable barrier to the development of a capsule-based KP vaccine [10, 11]. By comparison, only 9 KP OPS structures have been described, for which a subset (O1, O2, O3, O5) are associated with the vast majority (>80%) of clinical isolates worldwide [10, 12\u201314]. Despite the presence of a capsule, KP OPS has been found to be accessible to antibodies that have been shown to mediate opsonophagocytic uptake with killing by oxidative burst, and imparted protection in animal models of pneumonic and disseminated infection [15\u201317]. As isolated antigens, bacterial polysaccharides are generally poorly immunogenic and fail to induce immunological memory, a limitation that is overcome by linkage or association with a protein carrier [18]. We report, herein, the preclinical development of a broad-spectrum four component conjugate vaccine for KP and PA based on chemical conjugation of the four prevalent KP OPS types with the two PA flagellin types."

Briefly, 5\u201310 colonies were selected from an HS agar plate grown overnight at 37\u00b0C and used to inoculate a 250 mL shake flask containing 50 mL of CDM (supplemented with 0.025% guanine for CVD 3001). This culture was grown for 11\u201313 h at 37\u00b0C with agitation at 250 rpm and then used to inoculate a separate 500 mL culture in a 2 L shake flask containing the same media that was then grown under the same conditions for 11\u201313 h. Four liters of CDM (with 0.025% guanine for CVD 3001) was then inoculated to an OD600 nm of 0.15 with the 500 mL shake flask and maintained in fermentation culture at 400 rpm, 4 LPM ambient air, and continuous adjustment to pH 7 with 28% ammonium hydroxide. Eighteen to 24 hours post inoculation, the whole fermentation culture was then transferred to glass bottles and KP OPS was released by nitrous acid deamination essentially as described previously [13] by bringing the culture to 5\u201310% acetic acid / 0.5% sodium nitrite pH 3.7 with incubation at 4\u00b0C under agitation for 16\u201324 hours. Insoluble material and bacterial cells were then removed by 10,000 x g centrifugation at 4\u00b0C with a GS3 Rotor in a Sorvall RC5B. The post-extraction supernatant (PES) was then brought to 1M NaCl and filtered by microfiltration through a 0.2 \u03bcm hollow-fiber filter (GE, NJ) at 4.5 psi transmembrane pressure (TMP) passing the full volume followed by flushing with an equivalent volume of 1 M NaCl. Filtered PES / 1 M NaCl was then concentrated ~10-fold on a 0.1 m2 10 kDa Tangential flow filtration (TFF) Hydrosart flat sheet membrane (Sartorius, Germany) at 14 psi TMP and diafiltered 35-fold with 1 M NaCl and then 10-fold with 20 mM Tris / 50 mM NaCl pH 7. The TFF retentate was then passed through a Sartobind Q capsule (75 mL) at 45 mL/min in negative mode with collection of the flow through and a subsequent flush with 5 bed volumes (BV) of 20 mM Tris / 50 mM NaCl pH 7. The pooled flow-through and wash were then brought to 1.9 M Ammonium sulfate and incubated 16\u201324 hours at 4\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 4\u00b0C with a GS3 Rotor in a Sorvall RC5. The cleared supernatant was then filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm followed by TFF through a 50 cm2 300 kDa polyethersulfone (PES) membrane (Biomax, Millipore, MA) at <2 psi TMP followed by flushing with 60 mL of DI water. Filtered OPS was then concentrated to 5\u201310 mg/mL by TFF on 2 x 200 cm2 5 kDa Hydrosart membranes in a Slice 200 holder at 14 psi TMP followed by 10-fold diafiltration with DI water. The retentate fraction was then filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm, frozen and lyophilized for dry weight recovery. Purified polysaccharides were assessed for removal of protein and endotoxin respectively by Bradford assay (Biorad, CA) and chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay with the Endosafe PTS system (Charles River, MA). Residual nucleic acid was assessed by absorbance at 260 nm. Identity for each polysaccharide was confirmed by high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) with an ICS-4000 system (Thermo-Dionex, MA) and CarboPac PA10 column (Thermo-Dionex, MA) run at 0.01 mL/min using commercially available monosaccharide standards (Sigma, MA). For this, polysaccharide samples and monosaccharide standards were prepared by boiling for 4 hours in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid that were then frozen, lyophilized and reconstituted in milli-Q water for injection. Molecular size was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography with size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC) with a Biosep SEC4000 column (Phenomenex, CA) run at 1 mL/min on an Alliance 2795 HPLC (Waters, MA) in PBS / 0.02% sodium azide pH 7.4 with detection by refractive index (RI) on a 2414 RI detector (Waters, MA)."

Briefly, 5\u201310 single colonies were selected from overnight growth at 37\u00b0C on HS plates supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin for plasmid maintenance, and used to inoculate a 50 mL culture in a 250 mL shake flask containing Terrific Broth (TB; Invitrogen, MA) supplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin and 1% glucose that was grown for 8 hours at 30\u00b0C with 250 rpm agitation. This culture was then used to inoculate a separate 500 mL culture in a 2 L shake flask containing the same media that was then grown under the same conditions for 12h. This culture was then used to inoculate the 8 L fermenter culture to an OD600nm of ~0.15, that was grown in TB with 50 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin without glucose at 30\u00b0C and maintained at 250 rpm, 4 LPM ambient air, and continuous adjustment to pH 7 with 28% ammonium hydroxide until the OD600nm reached ~3. Induction of flagellin production was then carried out for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C with addition of 1 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma Aldrich), after which cells were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 30 min at room temperature and the pellet stored at -80\u00b0C until protein extraction. The recombinant flagellin was purified from the soluble fraction after extraction with B-PER reagent (ThermoFisher, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 40 mins at 4\u00b0C the supernatant was filtered through a Polycap 150 TC 0.45 \u03bcm depth filter (Whatman, UK). The filtered sample was brought to 20 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5 (binding buffer) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C under agitation with Ni-Sepharose\u2122 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Biosciences, NJ). The resin was poured into a gravity flow column, washed with five BV of binding buffer and the 6xHis recombinant protein eluted with 20 mM Tris / 0.5M NaCl / 250 mM imidazole pH 7.4 with gravity flow. The eluate was then further purified by sequential TFF, cation and anion exchange membrane chromatography as described previously [30]. Purified flagellin proteins were confirmed for purity and integrity by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining, removal of residual endotoxin by limulus amebocyte lysate assay with the Endosafe PTS system (Charles River, MA), and were stored at -80\u00b0C until use.

Bacterial clearance was assessed 4 hours after infection by assessing viable CFU in the blood, liver and spleen. Mortality after IV KP infection was assessed for 1 week as described above. For PA burn wound infection, mice were infected as described with minor modifications [35]. Briefly, mice had their backs shaved 24 hours prior to infection. On the day of infection, they were sedated with ketamine and xylazine and then the burn was induced by pressing a polymer card cutout template representing roughly 30% of total body surface area on the shaved back followed by the application of 0.5 mL of 90% ethanol spread uniformly into the cutout, ignited with a flame and allowed to burn for 10 seconds. Mice were infected by subcutaneous injection at the burn site with 100 \u03bcL of either ~10\u201320 CFU of PA M2 (LD50 <10 CFU) or ~3\u20134 x 106 CFU of PA PAK (LD50 ~3.5 x 105 CFU) in PBS, and replenished with 500 \u03bcL sterile saline given IP.

Whereas wild-type B5055 grew on CDM lacking guanine (Fig 1A), and displayed a thick white halo after capsule staining (Fig 1B), deletion of guaBA abolished growth in the absence of exogenous guanine and further deletion of the capsule genes rendered the strain non-encapsulated as seen by the absence of the white halo surrounding the cell. CVD 3001 was highly attenuated in the mouse model of infection with an IP LD50 > 109 CFU compared to ~ 104 CFU for B5055. A similar strategy was utilized to generate reagent strain CVD 3002, by deletion of the wzabc genes from KP 4425/51 (O5:K57). KP 7380 is a non-encapsulated O2 isolate, and hence was used as a reagent strain without any further modification. KP 390 (O3:K11) was found to be refractory to our attempts at genetic engineering.

HPLC-SEC analyses of the purified polysaccharides revealed that they were each comprised of a relatively homogenous molecular size population that was similar among the 4 OPS types (Fig 2A). Monosaccharide composition analyses by HPAEC-PAD for depolymerized KP OPS further confirmed that KP O1 and O2 were polygalactans whereas KP O3 and O5 were comprised of mannose (not shown). Purified PA FlaA1 and FlaB, expressed as recombinant proteins in E. coli, generated protein bands at the predicted molecular weight based on amino acid sequence and defined peaks by HPLC-SEC congruent with the monomeric form (Fig 2B and 2C), with less than 0.1 endotoxin units/\u03bcg protein. KP OPS molecules were linked at the reducing end with an aminoooxy-thiol linker to PA Fla protein lysines that had been derivatized with a maleimide molecule. Conjugation by this approach generated sun-type neoglycoconjugates for which the OPS chain remains intact, and extends from the protein surface (S1 Fig). HPLC-SEC analysis of the purified glycoconjugates indicated that each maintained a relatively narrow size distribution that was similar among the different conjugates (Fig 2D), and with roughly equivalent polysaccharide to protein ratios (Table 2). Further we found that whereas rFlaA and rFlaB strongly activated TLR5 signaling, conjugation reliably ablated TLR5 bioactivity (S2 Fig)."

                "Antimicrobial resistance is a major problem globally, forecasted to severely impact public health with increasing rates of mortality due to AMR infections [37]. With the paucity of new antibiotics and novel drug classes in the pipeline, alternative and adjunct strategies are urgently needed to prevent poorly or otherwise unmanageable AMR bacterial infections [38]. Immunoprophylactic approaches are not affected by the molecular mechanisms of resistance inherent in AMR, and can protect against infection with antibiotic susceptible and resistant strains. Indeed, there is convincing prior evidence for the promise of vaccines in counteracting infections with AMR pathogens. The emergence in the late 1990s of AMR Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib) and S. pneumoniae isolates coincided fortuitously with the introduction of the newly developed glycoconjugate vaccines for these pathogens. Surveillance studies conducted prior to and following vaccine introduction documented that the use of these vaccines led to a marked reduction of the overall incidence of Hib and pneumococcal disease that included AMR strains [4, 39]. Vaccine approaches offer the additional benefit in lowering the necessity for antibiotic use, which is an independent contributing factor for acquisition of AMR phenotypes [3]. There are a multitude of studies centered on the development of PA vaccines that have assessed a range of antigens including outer membrane proteins, O polysaccharides, exopolysaccharides, toxins, pili and flagella [5]. However, comparatively less effort has been directed towards development of a vaccine for KP [9]. Among these, even fewer have addressed the notion of targeting both pathogens simultaneously. Early phase clinical trials assessed co-administration of separate multivalent KP and PA vaccine preparations comprised of 24 different KP capsule types or 8 different PA OPS types conjugated to PA exotoxin A. Unfortunately, marked variability in the immune response to individual PS components was noted [40]. KP OPS-based vaccines require fewer vaccine antigens to achieve broad coverage, yet there is a paucity of published studies that have evaluated OPS glycoconjugates. Several studies have reported the development of glycoconjugate vaccines with KP O1 OPS, including as conjugates with KP iron regulated outer membrane proteins and tetanus toxoid [41, 42]. The recent reports of protective monoclonal antibodies directed against KP OPS further support the utility of targeting the KP O antigen [43\u201345]. To our knowledge this is the first study to test an OPS vaccine formulation that includes all four of the predominant O types.",
                "We found that conjugation to a protein carrier significantly enhanced anti-OPS immunity relative to immunization with the unconjugated polysaccharide antigen. Polysaccharides are generally thymus-independent antigens that are poorly immunogenic and do not induce immunologic memory, class-switch, or affinity maturation. Covalent coupling of bacterial polysaccharides with proteins allows for T-cell help, and has enhanced the magnitude, quality and duration of the humoral immune response [46]. Heterologous pathogen carrier proteins are used widely in commercially available glycoconjugates including the aforementioned Hib and pneumococcus vaccines [47]. The most commonly used carrier proteins in these vaccines are tetanus toxoid or inactivated derivatives of diphtheria toxoid. However, these antigens are already administered during routine immunization schedules and high levels of preexisting anti-carrier immunity have been associated with diminished immunogenicity through epitopic suppression mechanisms [48]. The use of a novel, pathogen-relevant carrier protein offers the potential to extend valency or coverage for other pathogens. The sole available vaccine that utilizes this strategy is the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Synflorix (GlaxoSmithKline) that uses protein D from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) as a carrier with intent of extending coverage to prevention of NTHi otitis media [49]. Work from our group and others has found that flagellin proteins (e.g., from Salmonella and Burkholderia) are effective carrier proteins when linked to the homologous pathogen OPS molecules [19, 32, 50, 51]. PA flagellin proteins have been reported previously as effective carriers for PA alginate exopolysaccharide in murine studies where measurable antibody levels were induced to both carrier and hapten antigens and protection was imparted against PA pneumonia infection [50]. Our results here indicate that PA flagellin is also an effective carrier for KP OPS, and furthermore that rFlaA and rFlaB maintain equivalent carrier function. While anti-flagellin titers were lower upon conjugation, anti-flagellin antibodies induced after conjugate vaccine immunization demonstrated functional motility inhibition, and protected in mouse models of burn wound infection with a prototype FlaB isolate. We found, however, that anti-rFlaA antibodies induced by conjugated or unconjugated protein offered negligible protection against burn wound infections and did not inhibit motility with PAK (FlaA1). This result is unexpected, as recombinant FlaA has generated functional antibodies in prior studies [52, 53]. Both PA FlaA and FlaB proteins can become glycosylated at two sites in the serotype specific variable region [54, 55]. The carbohydrate moieties associated with FlaA are larger (6\u201311 saccharides) than those associated with FlaB (disaccharide). Our recombinant flagellin proteins expressed in E. coli do not contain these modifications. It is conceivable that the longer carbohydrate modifications on FlaA impede accessibility of antibodies to the protein surface, in a manner that is less prominent for FlaB. It is also possible that the recombinant FlaA protein was improperly folded resulting in disruption of key protective epitopes. However, as rFlaA maintained TLR5 bioactivity, this suggests that the protein is at least partially correctly folded. Alternatively, it is further conceivable that our PAK target strain may have downregulated flagellin in vivo as a consequence of alginate production, a known biofilm promoting factor that is expressed during PA burn wound infections [56, 57].",
                "We assessed herein protection against challenge by distinct routes for KP and PA. Future work should assess protection in additional challenge models, including those for pneumonia that is a common complication for KP and PA nosocomial infections [1]. PA flagellin-based vaccines have been assessed in clinical studies, where they were found to be safe and immunogenic [58]. Intriguingly, parenteral immunization with PA Fla proteins induced IgG antibodies that could be found in the sera as well as the pulmonary mucosa [59]. Effective immunity at the mucosal surface is desirable as KP and PA can cause bacterial pneumonias. They can also asymptomatically colonize the gastrointestinal tract and nasopharynx of susceptible individuals [60, 61]. Genomic sequencing of Klebsiella isolates from septic patients has indicated that the infecting strain in most (>80%) instances is genetically identical to the colonizing isolate, suggesting that the colonizing strain is a reservoir for infection [60]. Future studies should thus also address whether the quadrivalent KP-OPS:PA-Fla vaccine can prevent bacterial colonization at mucosal surfaces, as has been documented for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines [62]. Additionally, whereas KP infections have generally been associated with impaired immunologic function consequent to age or disease comorbidity and in hospital settings, community acquired highly mucoid hypervirulent KP (hvKP) strains, first described in the Asia Pacific rim, have been associated with septic and focal infections including liver abscesses in otherwise healthy individuals [63]. Mouse pathogenicity analyses of a prototype hvKP K1 isolate indicated that the O antigen was an essential virulence factor [64]. It would thus also be of importance to determine in the course of future studies whether anti-OPS antibodies maintain protection against these highly mucoid isolates [15, 17, 43, 65]."
