                        "Circular pitfall traps are the most common way to protect furniture from bed bugs that crawl from the room onto the bed and to monitor bed bug populations. These circular traps have pitfall areas with almost vertical sides that are either too smooth for a bed bug to climb or coated with talc so the bugs cannot get a grip to climb. There are several problems with these types of traps. Debris easily falls in the traps and coats the sides with dirt. Bed bugs then can easily climb out. Also, when placing traps with pitfall sides coated with talc, the talc is easily removed by touching with fingers or hands. Bed bugs can, over time, climb these smooth or talc-coated surfaces, so bed bug escape from these traps can occur.",
                        "Sticky traps have become popular for monitoring/trapping crawling insects, such as cockroaches and the like. However, traditional sticky traps have problems in trapping bed bugs. For example, research has shown that when a bed bug approaches a sticky trap, the bed bug touches one part of the sticky trap and is able to use their other legs which are not on the sticky trap enough leverage to pull the trapped leg(s) from the sticky traps.",
                        "The use of transparent paper such as acetate paper, surrounding a sticky trap can be smooth enough to reduce the leverage factor to prevent the bed bug from pulling themselves off the trap. However, test data has shown that using too smooth of a surface causes a behavior problem where the bed bug actually avoids traveling on the smooth. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,825 to Gehret describes a glue trap having a slippery surface about the perimeter that does not allow for the cockroach to have enough leverage to remove themselves from the sticky trap. The problem is that the \u201csilicone coated . . . paper . . . \u201d referenced in this patent has been demonstrated to cause bed bugs to avoid the surface as a travel surface. The too slippery surface causes a behavior effect in the bed bugs to avoid contact with very slippery surfaces.",
                        "A major problem in motels and hotels is the proliferation of bed bug type insects that can travel from the floor up legs of furniture. The above devices are not capable of stopping and preventing all bed bugs from climbing from a floor location up legs to furniture, such as beds, and the like.",
                        "Thus, the need exists for solutions to the above problems with the prior art."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "A primary objective of the present invention is to provide traps, coasters, devices, apparatus, systems and methods for preventing and capturing insects, such as bed bugs, from climbing up furniture legs to furniture where persons rest or sleep thereon.",
                        "A secondary objective of the present invention is to provide traps, coasters, devices, apparatus, systems and methods for preventing and capturing insects that combines a smooth(slick) surface along with or without a sticky surface for protecting furniture from insects, such as bed bugs.",
                        "A third objective of the present invention is to provide traps, coasters, devices, apparatus, systems and methods for preventing and capturing insects that combines a pesticide treated surface along with or without a sticky surface for protecting furniture from insects, such as bed bugs",
                        "The invention can work with different types of furniture, such as but not limited to beds, cots, bassinets, cribs, easy chair, reclining chairs, and any other furniture, where a person would rest or sleep.",
                        "This invention encompasses a novel pitfall trap with an inner lip and an outer lip overhanging the pitfall area. The sides do not need to be smooth or talc-coated, but the underside of the lip can be smooth(slick) with or without pesticide treated to prevent bed bug/insect movement.",
                        "There are several reasons this invention is superior to vertical smooth sides. The first is that bed bugs have more difficulty crossing the underside smooth(slick) and/or pesticide treated surface upside down. The bugs cannot hang on the surface and fall into the pitfall part of the trap. Therefore, this invention is better for capturing bed bugs. A second reason the trap is superior is that the underside smooth/pesticide surface is protected from debris that falls from the room into the trap. Debris falls on the sides and bottom of the trap, but does not adhere to the inner smooth/pesticide underside surface. Therefore the trap remains effective when used as directed.",
                        "The bottom of the trap can be coated with insecticide to kill bugs that fall into the trap or with sticky glue to retain them. The coating is not necessary to retain the bugs but is an optional part of the trap.",
                        "This Invention incorporates one or more of the following elements in order to produce a barrier that prevents bed bugs and other crawling insects from climbing on a piece of furniture.",
                        "An embodiment of the invention can be the combination of both a sticky surface in the pit to prevent insect escape and a slick surface or a pesticide-treated surface on the underside of a barrier the insects have to cross.",
                        "The novel pitfall trap barrier can be used to prevent bed bugs and other crawling insects from climbing on a piece of furniture. The inside of the pitfall can optionally be lined with a sticky substance to prevent insect escape. The underside of the barrier is a slick or pesticide treated surface in order to further prevent escape.",
                        "The invention can combine slick(smooth) surfaces to be adjacent to sticky surfaces, where the insect becomes stuck on the sticky surface and cannot remove themselves because they cannot get traction leverage by stepping on the adjacent (i.e. direction next to one another) slick(smooth) surface.",
                        "Further objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments which are illustrated schematically in the accompanying drawings."

                        "With the embodiments described, above, the upside down smooth or pesticide treated surfaces would not generally attract dirt, since these treated surfaces are elevated underneath pitfall barriers.",
                        "Although the embodiments describe having either a smooth or pesticide treated under surface areas, the invention can be practiced with an underside surface area portions having a combined smooth(slick) and pesticide surface for the upside down facing surfaces that do not touch a floor surface.",
                        "The invention can be used in other applications in addition to being underneath furniture. For example, the novel traps can be placed in various locations around a space, such as on a floor, stairs, a shelf, top of furniture, in commercial locations (hotels, motels and the like) as well as any residential locations (houses, condominiums, and the like). The novel invention can be used in other areas were bed bugs can occur, such as but not limited to recreational vehicles, truck cabins, inside vans and automobiles, and the like.",
