                        "Aluminum (Al) is the most widely used non-ferrous metal. The global production of Al in 2016 was 58.8 million metric tons. It exceeded that of any other metal, except iron. Aluminum is commonly alloyed, and alloying markedly improves its mechanical properties, especially when tempered. Aluminum and its alloys have been successfully, and will be continuously, used for many industries that include, but are not limited to, transportation, packing, electronics, building and construction, machinery, and equipment industries. Emerging applications for aluminum and its alloys such as coatings and energy storage are growing rapidly.",
                        "The electrochemical coating market is predominantly driven by the electrical and electronics industry for making electrical device components corrosion and wear resistant, further supported by the automotive industry in which coatings are used for rust protection and brightening of metal and non-metal components. Compared to conventional metal coatings (e.g., zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni)), aluminum (Al) coating has recently received increasing attention because of its several attributes that include, e.g., high corrosion resistance, superior environmental friendliness, low-risk of hydrogen embrittlement, high electrical conductivity, and high-temperature tolerance. In addition, the anodization of aluminum offers enhanced corrosion resistance and surface durability.",
                        "In the nuclear industry, aluminum is often used in a relatively pure (e.g., greater than about 99.0 wt. %) 2S (or 1100) form. In this form, it has been extensively used as a reactor structural material, as a material for fuel cladding, and as material for other purposes, such as those not involving exposure to very high temperatures.",
                        "Despite its many advantages, aluminum coating has been used, conventionally, in only limited industrial, commercial, and defense-related applications. In principle, the electrodeposition of Al is more challenging than the electrodeposition of other conventional coating metals. Because Al is a water-sensitive metal and can easily form a passivation oxide layer on the surface, it cannot be deposited from conventional electrolyte baths that are aqueous. Technologically, Al can be deposited from the Hall-H\u00e9roult process or its modified processes, which processes are based on molten salt systems. However, molten salt systems are generally high-temperature systems, and operating the processes at high temperatures remains a challenge for achieving aluminum deposition in a cost-affordable manner.",
                        "Recently, the electrodeposition of Al in ionic liquids (ILs) has been investigated for a range of potential applications. ILs are a unique class of non-aqueous, ion-conducting, liquid electrolytes with relatively excellent chemical and electrochemical stability. Due to high solvation capability for Al-salt precursors, ionic liquid systems allow the deposition of Al at relatively lower temperatures compared to the temperatures involved in molten salt systems.",
                        "Conventional IL-based technologies commonly employ an electroplating bath (e.g., electrolyte solution) comprising an air- and moisture-stable ionic liquid (IL), such as 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMeIm]Cl) or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazonium chloride ([BMeIm]Cl), and an aluminum precursor that is, commonly, aluminum chloride (AlCl3). With such materials, it has been demonstrated that Al can be successfully electrodeposited. However, standardized and reproducible procedures have not yet been established, due to the challenges associated with the use of inert gas to sustain the deposition process. The success and quality of the resulting electrodeposited aluminum material, using these conventional IL-based systems, tend to be quite sensitive to a number of operational factors, including the composition of the electrolyte mixture (AlCl3-to-IL ratio), the nature of IL cations and anions, operating temperature, deposition rate, substrate-pretreatment, stirring, and additives. Therefore, electrochemical deposition (e.g., electroplating) of metals, such as aluminum, via ionic liquids continues to present challenges."

                        "Disclosed are methods and systems for the electrochemical deposition of a metal-based (e.g., aluminum-based) coating on a substrate using an ionic liquid electrolyte solution comprising at least one imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate (e.g., alkyl methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate(s)). Compared to convention electrochemical deposition (e.g., electroplating) processes, embodiments of the disclosure have the potential to be performed at lower temperatures (e.g., less than about 200\u00b0 C. (less than about 392\u00b0 F.), e.g., less than about 180\u00b0 C. (less than about 356\u00b0 F.)), e.g., about room temperature (e.g., operation temperatures within a range from about 20\u00b0 C. (about 68\u00b0 F.) to about 25\u00b0 C. (about 77\u00b0 F.)). The methods and systems also facilitate control of the process chemistry and material handling while allowing the deposition of metal coatings via non-aqueous electrochemical systems. Accordingly, embodiments of the disclosure make use of a class of ionic liquids (IL), namely, imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallates (e.g., imidazolium-based tetrachloroaluminates), in place of currently-used imidazolium-based chlorides, for the electrodeposition of, e.g., Al. In some embodiments, the systems and methods provide the advantage of there being a fixed 1:1 ratio of imidazolium to tetrahalo-metallate (e.g., tetrachloroaluminate), which 1:1 ratio may facilitate the analysis and control of the process chemistry. Furthermore, tetrahalo-metallates (e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methlimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ([EMeIm]AlCl4), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroaluminate ([BMeIm]AlCl4)) may have lower melting points than their corresponding halide counterparts (e.g., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMeIm]Cl), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMeIm]Cl), respectively), which also facilitates electrodeposition at lower operation temperatures. Lower operation temperatures may facilitate lower operation costs and improved quality coatings formed from the electrochemical deposition.",

At least with the inclusion of the precursor 120 in the electrolyte solution 106, in addition to the inclusion of the imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate 108, the imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate 108 may be suitable for use in the electrolyte solution 106 of an electrochemical deposition process with an electric potential difference (e.g., a \u201cpotential window\u201d) range from about 2V to about 4V.",

In trials not including the precursor 120, and with an operation temperature range of 30\u00b0 C. (86 F) to 110\u00b0 C.

Adding AlCl3 (e.g., the precursor 120) to the [EMeIm]AlCl4 in the electrolyte solution 106 generated obvious redox peaks in cyclic voltammograms, corresponding to the Al deposition and dissolution, and well-developed nucleation-growth loops in current-time transients. The characterization of the deposits were prepared through constant-potential cathode polarization by scanning-electron-microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) microscope and clearly showed that metallic Al had been successfully deposited from the AlCl3-[EMeIm]AlCl4 system.

They display rather flat zones between the fast-growing oxidation and reduction currents, as well as very close onset potentials for considerable oxidation-current growth. In contrast, the onset potentials for the reduction-current growth are strongly dependent on temperature, characteristic of their positive shift with increasing temperature. Based on the onset potential difference for the oxidation and reduction current growth, the values of electrochemical windows for [EMeIm]AlCl4 (e.g., the imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate 108) on the GC electrode (e.g., the working electrode (substrate) 114) were measured. The electrochemical windows decreased from approximately 3.2 V to 2.3 V as the temperature increased from 30\u00b0 C. (86\u00b0 F.) to 110\u00b0 C. (230\u00b0 F.). These results are consistent with literature data measured under similar conditions. In the electrochemical windows, no oxidation peak associated with the anodic oxidation was discerned. This strongly indicated that the complex species bearing Al was stable and that no metallic Al was formed in the cathodic scans, although small abrupt reduction currents were observed.",

By reference to literature results, the reduction peaks appear to correspond to the deposition of Al (e.g., the coating 104) and the oxidation peaks are caused by the anodic dissolution of Al. Their onset deposition potentials are approximately \u22120.32 V at 30\u00b0 C. (86\u00b0 F.) and \u22120.11 V at 110\u00b0 C. (230\u00b0 F.).

The use of 1:1 ratio led to the disappearance of the cathodic peak that was seen for the 1:5 ratio case. The reduction currents changed almost linearly with varying potential. Further increasing the ratio to 1.5:1 resulted in different reduction-current and potential responses. In the three cases, similar oxidation peaks were seen in the positive scans. However, the peak currents showed slight decreases when more AlCl3 (e.g., the precursor 120) was added to [EMeIm]AlCl4 (e.g., the precursor 120). Without being bound to any theory, the unusual changes may be related to the mass of Al attached on the GC electrode (e.g., the working electrode (substrate) 114), which contributes to the peak currents, as well as the form of the intermediates bearing Al. In an AlCl3-[EMeIm]Cl system, it has been suggested that the primary form of the intermediate changes with the variation of the AlCl3 to [EMeIm]Cl ratio. Accordingly, the form of the intermediates\u2014in the precursor 120 and imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate 108 electrolyte solution 106 of embodiments of the disclosure\u2014may be impacted by the precursor 120 to imidazolium-based tetrahalo-metallate 108 ratio.",
