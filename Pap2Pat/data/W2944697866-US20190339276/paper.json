    "title": "The ERH gene regulates migration and invasion in 5637 and T24 bladder cancer cells",
    "date": "2019-03-12",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether the enhancer of the rudimentary homolog (ERH) gene regulates cell migration and invasion in human bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) T24 cells and the underlying mechanism. First, we knocked down ERH in BUC T24 and 5637 cells by shRNA and then used wound healing cell scratch migration assays, transwell cell migration assays, transwell cell invasion chamber experiments and nude mouse tail vein transfer assays to determine the migration and invasion ability after ERH was knocked down. Moreover, we used gene expression profiling chip analysis and further functional experiments to explore the possible mechanism through which ERH knockdown downregulated metastasis ability in T24 cells. Wound healing cell scratch migration assays, transwell cell migration assays, transwell cell invasion chamber experiments and nude mouse tail vein transfer assays all showed that the metastasis ability was significantly inhibited in human BUC T24 and 5637 cells with ERH knockdown. A gene expression profiling chip analysis in T24 cells showed that the MYC gene may be an important downstream target of the ERH gene, and the functional experiments showed that MYC is a functional target of ERH in BUC T24 cells. ERH knockdown could inhibit the metastasis of BUC T24 cells in vitro and in vivo. This study further explored the mechanism of the ERH gene in the metastasis of the T24 human bladder cancer cell line and found that ERH may regulate MYC gene expression. The results of this research provide a basis for the clinical application of ERH as a potential target for BUC treatment.",

                "Bladder carcinoma is one of the most common urologic malignancies worldwide [1]. Bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) accounts for 90% of all bladder carcinomas, and 30% of BUCs are muscle-invasive bladder cancers [2]. BUC occurrence is second to only prostate cancer in the urothelial system: approximately 70,000 new cases occur each year and cause approximately 15,000 deaths [3]. Enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), which has been found in plants, animals, and protists, may be involved in many cellular functions, such as pyrimidine metabolism, cell cycle progression, and transcription control [4]. In our previous study [5], we found ERH expression in human BUC 5637 and T24 cell lines and that this expression is upregulated in BUC cells. We showed that ERH knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis in BUC T24 cells. In this study, we further confirmed that the ERH gene regulates migration and invasion in human BUC 5637 and T24 cells. In addition, we used gene expression profile chips and found that ERH may regulate BC cell proliferation and apoptosis through the MYC gene."

A lentiviral-based shRNA strategy was used to knockdown ERH in human bladder cancer T24 cells. Lentiviruses expressing shRNA specifically targeting human ERH (ERH-shRNA, ERH KD group, target sequence: CTGGTTTACCGAGCTGATA) or a scrambled sequence (ScrshRNA, ERH normal cell (NC) group, sequence: TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) were generated. Subsequently, T24 human bladder cancer cells were used to examine the knockdown efficiency at the mRNA and protein levels. The cells were plated in 6-well plates and subsequently infected with the lentivirus expressing ERH-shRNA. The cells were cultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C in an incubator with 5% CO2 until they reached 30% confluence. The cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted to determine the knockdown efficiency using real-time PCR assays. When the infection efficiency was greater than 70%, the cells were used for the subsequent experiments. The results showed that the lentiviral-based shRNA strategy could effectively and efficiently inhibit ERH expression at the mRNA level (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01)."

Twenty-eight days after transplantation, the mice were euthanized, and their lungs were harvested. By ex vivo imaging, we further confirmed that ERH knockdown could suppress lung metastasis and vessel invasion in BUC T24 cell lines (Fig.\u00a05a). The number of lung metastases was judged by the amount of fluorescence and by manually counting the lung nodule number. Lung metastases were detected in 10/10 mice in the ERH NC-luciferase group and in 3/10 mice in the ERH KD-luciferase group (Fig.\u00a05b). The number of lung metastases in the ERH NC-luciferase group was 17.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.59, and the number of lung metastases in the ERH KD-luciferase group was 0.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15 (T\u2009=\u200910.68, p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Following bioinformatic and normalization analyses, the two groups (ERH NC and ERH KD) showed differences according to a hierarchical cluster analysis, as shown in Fig. 6. Gene expression microarray results showed that the expression of the ERH gene in the ERH KD group was significantly reduced; the FC value was \u2212\u20094.50, p\u2009<\u20090.0001.

Heatmap colors represent the mean-centered fold change expression in log-space. b. According to the results of the ERH microarray, several differentially expressed genes related to cell migration and invasion were selected. A network map of these genes shows that the MYC gene was in the center position. c shows the expression of the MYC gene after ERH knockdown in BUC 5637 and T24 cells using the real-time PCR method. MYC gene expression in the ERH KD group was 0.345 and 0.568 times that of the ERH NC group in 5637 and T24 cells, respectively (all p\u2009<\u20090.01). d shows the Western blot analysis of MYC protein expression in BUC 5637 and T24 cells following ERH knockdown.

                "The ERH gene, which was first found in Drosophila, can also be found in flowering plants, Aedes aegypti, house mice, nematodes and humans, and its function has been implicated in pyrimidine biosynthesis and the cell cycle [4]. The ERH monomer comprises a single domain consisting of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, and \u03b24) and three \u03b1-helices (\u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13) [7]. Many of the surface residues of ERH are conserved, including patches of hydrophobic and charged residues, suggesting protein-protein interaction interfaces [8]. The structure of ERH is characterized by a novel \u03b1\u2009+\u2009\u03b2 fold, which is a four-strand antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with three alpha-helixes on one side of the sheet. The \u03b2-sheets from the two monomers together constitute a pseudo-\u03b2-barrel and form the center of the functional ERH dimer, with a cavity channel at the dimer interface; ERH has also been shown to be important in pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional repression [9]. ERH was shown to be an interaction partner of DCoH/PCD (dimerization cofactor of HNF1/pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase) by a yeast two-hybrid assay. DCoH/PCD is a multifunctional factor originally identified as a positive cofactor of the HNF1 homeobox transcription factors [10].",
                "In 2008, it was shown that the expression of ERH is clearly higher in malignant breast cells than in benign breast cells in both primary human breast cancer and cell models of breast cancer [11]. ERH is known to interact with the zinc-finger protein CIZ1, a promoter of DNA replication that interacts with p21 (Cip1), a CDK2 inhibitor critical for cell cycle regulation [12]. Moreover, ERH interacts with SKAR, a cell growth regulator in the S6K1-signaling pathway [13]. ERH also interacts with the H19 gene and regulates growth in nephroblasts, rhabdomyosarcomas and choriocarcinoma cells [14]. ERH interacts with the spliceosome protein SNRPD3 and is required for the mRNA splicing of the mitotic motor protein CENP-E [15]. In addition, ERH expression is inversely associated with the survival of colorectal cancer patients whose tumors harbor KRAS mutations [16]. A predicted target site was detected in the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the ERH gene, and transfected cells showed an interaction between the luciferase reporter containing the target sequences and miR-574-3p in lung cancer A549 cell lines [17]. In 2015, it was shown that ERH regulates the DNA damage response in hepatocellular carcinoma [18]. In all of these previous studies, the relationship between the ERH gene and tumor migration and invasion was not studied.",
                "In our previous study [5], we found that ERH is positively expressed in human BUC 5637 and T24 cell lines and is upregulated in BUC cells. We further studied the relationship between ERH and tumor cell migration and invasion. After ERH was knocked down, human BUC 5637 and T24 cell migration and invasion decreased significantly. There is no existing report about the correlation between the ERH gene and the migration and invasion of BUC cells. We used a wound healing assay to determine whether ERH knockdown inhibited the migration of BUC 5637 and T24 cells. The results showed that the cell migration rate was significantly decreased after ERH knockdown. Transwell chamber assays were used to evaluate whether ERH knockdown could inhibit the migration of BUC 5637 and T24 cells. The results indicated that there were significant differences in the numbers of migrated BUC 5637 and T24 cells. Transwell invasion cell assays were used to evaluate whether ERH knockdown could inhibit the invasiveness of BUC 5637 and T24 cells. A nude mouse tail vein transfer assay showed that ERH knockdown could inhibit the metastasis of BUC T24 cells. These results show that the differences in the invasiveness of BUC 5637 and T24 cells after ERH knockdown are significantly different.",
                "EMT is crucial in cancer cell migration and invasion [19]. Three major changes constitute EMT in cancer cell migration. First, epithelial cells lose both cell-cell adhesions and the expression of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin. Second, these cells acquire the expression of N-cadherin, a mesenchymal marker. Third, the cells undergo major cytoskeletal rearrangements that enable them to acquire mesenchymal properties, such as cell migratory behaviors [20]. EMT is a potent component of the signaling and cellular alterations involved in the invasive growth and metastasis of cancer cells [21]. Zhao et al. [22] found that Twist and vimentin correlated with grade, recurrence, and progression but not with stage, and E-cadherin was related to stage but not the other parameters. Their study showed that vimentin is a potential independent indicator for predicting BUC progression and survival. Hong et al. [23] revealed that Snail/Twist signaling might be required for TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in bladder cancer cells. Western blotting was used to detect the migration-related proteins in BUC 5637 and T24 cells. The expression of E-cadherin in BUC 5637 cells and T24 cells after ERH knockdown was significantly increased, while the expression of fibronectin, Twist, vimentin and Snail2 was significantly decreased. This suggests that ERH may affect the migration and invasion ability of BUC through the EMT process. The present study indicated that the expression of E-cadherin was related to ERH knockdown in 5637 and T24 cells; these results agree with other studies showing that the loss of E-cadherin expression has been associated with migration and invasion in numerous types of epithelium-derived cancer cells [24]. Gene expression changes that help inhibit the epithelial phenotype and activate the mesenchymal phenotype involve the regulatory factors Snail and Twist [25]. The results of the present study also showed that the expression of Snail and Twist was related to ERH knockdown, which indicated that ERH participates in the EMT process. Finding the downstream target gene of ERH is key to studying the mechanism through which ERH affects cell migration and invasion through the EMT process.",
                "Thus, we explored the molecular biological mechanism through which the ERH gene affects the migration and invasion of BUC cells by a gene expression profile chip. The gene expression profile chip showed that the expression of the ERH gene in the ERH knockdown group was significantly reduced, and the FC value was \u2212\u20094.50, p\u2009<\u20090.0001. Compared with those in the NC group, 344 genes were upregulated, and 254 genes were downregulated in the ERH knockdown group. We next built a network map based on IPA and found that the MYC gene might be an important downstream target of ERH.",
                "The MYC gene belongs to a group of early discovered classical oncogenes, including c-MYC, n-MYC and l-MYC, which are located on chromosome 8, chromosome 2 and chromosome 1, respectively. Over the past 30\u2009years, MYC has attracted the attention of a large number of cancer scientists, virus experts, biochemists and geneticists for its role in promoting proliferation, progression, chemoresistance, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis [26]. MYC promotes metastasis in established animal models of lung and prostate cancer [27, 28]. It has been proven that c-MYC transforms human mammary epithelial cells through the repression of the Wnt inhibitors DKK1 and SFRP1 in breast cancer cell lines [29]. E-cadherin repression contributes to c-Myc-induced epithelial cell transformation [30], which is consistent with our experimental results.",
                "In this study, we inhibited ERH expression in human bladder T24 cells with or without MYC overexpression to determine whether ERH-mediated MYC downregulation contributed to the inhibition of migration and invasion. We found that ERH knockdown does inhibit migration and invasion through MYC in BUC T24 cells through functional recovery experiments. Therefore, targeting the ERH-MYC-EMT regulatory circuit may be a novel strategy for the treatment of bladder cancer.",
                "The migration and invasion of BUC is the most critical factor affecting prognosis. Thus, it is urgent to find the underlying mechanism to identify a prognostic biomarker that can supply a potential therapeutic target. This study identified and explored the role of the ERH gene in the migration and invasion of BUC and the possible mechanism. This may provide a basis for the clinical application of ERH as a target for the detection and treatment of bladder cancer, which has great clinical potential."
