## BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART

Bladder cancer is a common disease in the clinical practice of urology, and it is also a common tumor in the urinary system, with high morbidity and mortality. The traditional diagnostic methods for bladder cancer include routine urine tests, urine exfoliative cytology, cystoscopy, KUB plain film, CT, MR, and other imaging findings that are associated with the development of the disease, invasion and metastasis. In recent years, molecular targeted diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer have received more and more attention in clinical practice as an important mean for comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of tumors and emerging therapeutic models. Multiple tumor markers such as MKI67, EGFR, ERBB2, TP53, PCNA and ETS-2 have been reported to be closely related to bladder cancer. In view of the dangers of bladder cancer, especially the high recurrence rate of non-invasive bladder cancer, makes early diagnosis, recurrence monitoring, and extensive routine screening necessary, and to find a target of molecular diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer with high sensitivity and specificity is of great significance.

The present invention has detected bladder cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues of the patients and found that ERH has good correlation with bladder cancer and can be used to prepare auxiliary diagnosis and treatment preparations for bladder cancer. In addition, cell function experiments such as RNA interference were performed to study the effect of ERH on the proliferation of bladder cancer cells. The present invention provides a research basis for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical bladder cancer.

**Example 10 Clone Formation Assay**

**1. Experimental Procedure**

(1) Preparing post-infectious cells: the objective cells were infected with lentivirus in the control group and the experimental group according to Example 6, and the cells in each experimental group in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized and resuspended in the complete culture medium to prepare a cell suspension, and count.

(2) Seeding the cells: each experimental group was inoculated with 400-1000 cells/well (determined according to cell growth) in a 6-well plate culture plate, and 3 replicate wells were set in each experimental group.

(3) Further culturing the inoculated cells in the incubator for 14 days or the number of cells in most of the individual clones was greater than 50, and the medium was changed and observed every 3 days.

(4) Photographing the cell clones under a fluorescence microscope before the termination of the experiment, and the cells were washed once with PBS.

(5) Adding 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde per well, fixed the cells for 30-60 min, and washed cells once with PBS.

(6) Adding 500 μL of clean, non-impurity GIEMSA dye solution to each well and stained the cells for 10-20 min.

(7) Washing the cells several times with ddH2O, air dried, took a photo with a digital camera, and counted the clones.

**2. Experimental Results**

The ability of the cells to grow tumorigenicity after lentivirus infection was demonstrated by the ability of the cells to colonize on the cell culture plate after infection. After shRNA lentivirus infection of T24 cells, the number of clones in the shERH group was significantly reduced compared with the shCtrl group (P<0.05), See FIG. 8 for details.

**Example 11 MTT Detection**

According to Example 6, the target cells of the control group and the experimental group were infected with lentivirus, and the detection was performed 24 to 120 hours after the plate was separated. The specific procedure was followed by the MTT kit (article number: JT343) instructions of Genview.

The OD490/fold was the OD490 multiple of the first day to the fifth day of each experimental group relative to the first day, indicating the multiple of proliferation on each day. FIG. 9 showed the time-dependent change in the absorbance change of the shERH group and the control group (shCtrl) in the plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm. OD490 here reflected the number of viable cells. The results showed that the proliferation of cells in the shERH group was slower compared to the shCtrl group.

**Example 12 Detection of Targets by Western Blot Reduces Expression of Target Gene Proteins**

**1. Total Protein Extraction**

Lentivirus infection was performed in the control group and the experimental group, and the objective cells in a good growth state after infection with lentivirus were collected, protein was extracted, and the protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Biyuntian BCA Protein Assay Kit, Cat. No. P0010S). Adjusted the protein concentration of each sample to 2 μg/μL and stored at −80° C. until use.

**2. SDS-PAGE**

According to the size of the protein molecular weight, a concentration of 10% separation gel and 5% concentration gel was formulated. After the gel had solidified, removed the comb, washed the sample well with electrophoresis buffer, and loaded the prepared sample. Stacking gel 80 mA for 20 min; separation gel 120 mA for 1 h.

**3. Immunoblotting**

After the electrophoresis was completed, the protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane by using a transfer electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad, Richmoad, Calif.) and electroconversion at 300 mA under a constant current of 4° C. for 120 min.

**4. Immunological Coloration**

1) Blocking: Blocked PVDF membranes at room temperature for 1 h or 4° C. overnight with blocking solution (containing 5% skim milk in TBST);

2) Incubating primary antibody: blocking antibody dilution (primary antibody Sigma Mouse Anti-Flag, Catalog No. F1804, 1:2000, primary Santa-Cruz Mouse anti-GAPDH Cat. No. sc-32233, 1:2000), and then sealed PVDF membrane incubate at room temperature for 2 h or 4° C. overnight;

3) Washing the membrane: TBST washed the membrane 3 times, each 10 min;

4) Incubating secondary antibody: The corresponding secondary antibody (second antibody Santa-Cruz Goat Anti-Mouse IgG cat. No. sc-2005, 1:2000) was diluted with a blocking solution, and the PVDF membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.

5) Washing film: TBST washed 3 times, each 10 min;

6) X-ray developing: Using Thermo's Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate Kit.


- - (1) Placed the PVDF membrane on the prefabricated fresh-keeping
    film, and mixed the liquid A and B in a ratio of 1:40. The mixture
    was uniformly added to the PVDF membrane and protected from light
    for 3-5 minutes.
  - (2) Took out the membrane, drained the excess ECL substrate reaction
    solution slightly, put it into the cassette, covered with plastic
    wrap (to avoid air bubbles), put the X-ray film (to avoid the
    movement of the X-ray film), closed the cassette, and exposed 1-2
    min.
  - (3) Took out the X-ray film, put it into the developer solution,
    removed it after about 1 minute, rinsed it in clean water for a few
    seconds, and put it into the fixing solution for at least 2 minutes.
  - (4) Removed the X-ray film, dried it, and analyzed.

**5. Experimental Results**

Western Blot results showed that the target vector shERH had a significant inhibitory effect on the expression of the target gene, and thus the target of the present invention was an effective target. The specific results were shown in FIG. 10.
