                        "Dengue is the most significant mosquito-born viral disease affecting humans. Up to one third of the world's population is at risk of dengue infection. Infection by dengue virus may result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations. These range from asymptomatic infection through dengue fever (DF) to dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).",
                        "It has been estimated that there are 50-100 million cases of DF and 250,000 to 500,000 cases of DHF each year {Rigau-Perez, 1998}. Dengue is a small single-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae comprised of four distinct serotypes (DEN1-4). Its genome consists of a single open reading frame directing the synthesis of a polypeptide which is cleaved by viral and host proteases into ten viral proteins. These include three structural proteins, core (C), envelope (E) and membrane (M), synthesized in precursor form (prM), and seven non-structural (NS) proteins {Rigau-Perez, 1998}.",
                        "Despite the seriousness of dengue-related disease, a complete understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive. It has been shown that higher virus titres during the early stages of DF correlates with progression to the more severe DHF {Vaughn, 2000 #708}. However, the lack of proper diagnostics and markers for monitoring the disease progression adds difficulties in predicting the severe outcome. With no vaccine or specific treatment available, a drug which reduced viral replication, and thus prevented the high viral load associated with more severe forms of the disease, represents an attractive option in the fight against dengue. Biomarkers for monitoring the disease course and outcome will also be critical in determining the proper treatment of the disease.",
                        "Current methods of diagnosing dengue use either PCR based approaches to look for viral genome (effective but technically difficult and expensive, requiring extensive laboratory facilities); or antibody detection methods to look for host IgG or IgM (that require 3 to 10 days post fever onset to reach detectable levels). Neither method allows rapid, sensitive detection at onset of fever that could be performed in a non-laboratory setting.",

                        "In this invention, we have identified a number of human serum proteins, in particular those of the NFkB initiated chemokine pathway that would be suitable targets for a diagnostic or prognostic test for Dengue. The proteins, either singular or in combination together, or in combination with viral proteins such as NS1, are able to detect the presence of a dengue infection and form the basis of our dengue detection invention.",
                        "We have also identified two host-response to dengue infection pathways, relating to interferon signalling, (Ubiquitin and Interferon pathway members) that prevent dengue virus replication and are thus novel, human, drug targets for controlling dengue viral replication and thus dengue disease.",
                        "Thus, we have demonstrated that dengue infection results in the elevated expression of a number of genes belonging to the following groups: (a) a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein; (b) a interferon-related protein; or (c) an NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein.",
                        "Accordingly, detection of expression of any one or more genes as described in this document can be used to diagnose, or provide an indication useful in the diagnosis of, dengue infection. Where the term \u201cdiagnosis\u201d is used in this document, it should be taken to include prognosis as well as diagnosis.",
                        "In particular, detection of expression of any one or more genes as described in this document can be used to detect dengue infection, to distinguish dengue infection from other diseases which may have the same or similar symptoms, and to predict the severity of disease.",
                        "We have established that it is possible to distinguish patients having fever as suffering from dengue from patients having fever, but who do not have dengue.",
                        "For example, the level of expression or activity of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1, GenBank Accession Number: NM\u2014024013) may be detected to detect dengue. A serum level of 389 ng/microlitre of interferon alpha may be used for example as a cut-off point. Thus, if a patient has a serum level of more than about 389 ng/microlitre of interferon alpha, then he is likely be actually suffering from dengue (rather than having a fever arising from other, non-dengue, causes, i.e., a non-dengue febrile illness). It will be appreciated that the level of 389 ng/microlitre of interferon alpha is not an absolute figure, and that it is possible to use other levels, e.g, in the range of 350-450 ng/microlitre of interferon alpha as cut-offs, but with perhaps a lower level of accuracy.",
                        "In addition, we find that the genes may be used as markers for the severity of dengue disease. Accordingly they may be used for example to assess whether it is likely that a patient needs further treatment, e.g., hospitalisation.",
                        "For example, the level of expression or activity of IP-10 (GenBank Accession Number: NM\u2014001565) may be detected as an indicator of the likelihood or severity of the disease. A serum level of 1697.9 ng/microlitre of IP-10 may be used for example as a cut-off point. Thus, if a patient has a serum level of more than about 1697.9 ng/microlitre of IP-10, then he is likely to develop dengue severe disease. It will be appreciated that the level of 1697.9 ng/microlitre of IP-10 is not an absolute figure, and that it is possible to use other levels, e.g, in the range of 1300-2100 ng/microlitre of IP-10 as cut-offs, but with perhaps a lower level of accuracy.",
                        "The expression or activity of the genes and proteins described here may be detected together with other indicators of dengue disease, for example, body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, blood cell count, haematocrit, haemoglobin levels, etc.",
                        "Furthermore, we find that these genes are activated in patients with dengue disease and that inhibiting these genes using compounds greatly reduces virus production in an in vitro model. We therefore provide for the use of any of these genes or corresponding proteins in the treatment or prevention of dengue. For example, activity or expression of the genes may be regulated for treating or preventing dengue. The genes or proteins may also be used as targets for drug development. We therefore provide for screens for molecules which bind to, agonise or antagonise any of these genes in the three pathways. Such screens may be used to identify molecules suitable for the treatment or prevention of dengue.",
                        "Therefore, accurately targeting the genes in these three groups (for example, ubiquitin pathway genes or the aspects of the ubiquitin pathway they represent) using small molecules, or other drug mechanisms, to reduce their activation is likely to provide a novel therapy for dengue disease.",
                        "This invention shows the mechanisms to enable early, rapid and easy diagnosis and prognosis of dengue infection; together with novel human drug targets that would prevent dengue disease.",
                        "According to the methods and compositions described here, any protein or activity involved in the following groups (a) a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein; (b) a interferon-related protein; or (c) an NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein may be modulated in order to reduce dengue viral function, which may be for the treatment or alleviation of dengue in an individual. Specifically, dengue may be treated or prevented by modulating the level of expression of, or the activity of, or both of any of these proteins. Thus, for example, a compound capable of modulating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be used as a treatment for dengue.",
                        "Any component of the relevant pathway in a cell may be modulated, in protein level, in activity or in expression. In some embodiments, the activity of a relevant protein is down-regulated to disrupt viral function or to treat dengue infection.",
                        "The inhibitor or inhibitors of these genes may be used in combination with any agent which is known or suspected to be efficacious in treating or alleviating dengue. Examples include the P4-PMO compounds 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS (targeting the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotides and the 3\u2032 cyclization sequence region, respectively) as described in Kinney et al., 2005, Inhibition of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 in vero cell cultures with morpholino oligomers, J Virol. 79(8), 5116-28. Other examples include the fullerenes described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,445. U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,899 describes methods of inhibition and treatment of Flavivirus including Dengue virus by Helioxanthin and its analogs, and such compounds may also be used in combination with ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein inhibitors as described herein for the treatment or alleviation of dengue.",
                        "The inhibitors, agonists, antagonists, etc for the treatment, prevention, alleviation and/or diagnosis of dengue may be packaged in a kit.",
                        "Such a kit may comprise means for the detection of a change in the expression pattern or level of any one or more of the following: (a) a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein; (b) a interferon-related protein; or (c) an NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein, together with instructions for use and may be suitable for detection, diagnosis or prognosis of dengue.",
                        "A further example of a kit may comprise means for modulating the level of expression of: (a) a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein; or (b) a interferon-related protein, together with instructions for use. Such a kit may be useful for treatment or prevention of dengue in an individual.",

                        "It will also be appreciated that compounds which are equivalent to these molecules may be used in place of, or in addition to MG-132 and/or ALLN, for treatment or prevention of dengue, and for use in the kits. In particular, we provide for the use of compounds similar in structure or functionally equivalent to MG-132 and/or ALLN for such purposes. These include in particular chemical derivatives of MG-132 and/or ALLN, chemical modifications of MG-132 and/or ALLN, substituted MG-132 and/or ALLN, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of MG-132 and/or ALLN, polymorphic forms of MG-132 and/or ALLN, isotopic variations of MG-132 and/or ALLN, prodrugs of MG-132 and/or ALLN, pro-moieties of MG-132 and/or ALLN and salts of MG-132 and/or ALLN, etc. Such equivalents of MG-132 and/or ALLN are described in detail in a separate section below.",

Caused by one of four closely related virus serotypes of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae, each serotype is sufficiently different that there is no cross-protection and epidemics caused by multiple serotypes (hyperendemicity) can occur. Dengue is transmitted to humans by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (rarely Aedes albopictus).",

There may also be gastritis with some combination of associated abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea.",
                                "Some cases develop much milder symptoms, which can, when no rash is present, be misdiagnosed as a flu or other viral infection. Thus, travellers from tropical areas may inadvertently pass on dengue in their home countries, having not being properly diagnosed at the height of their illness. Patients with dengue can only pass on the infection through mosquitoes or blood products while they are still febrile.",
                                "The classic dengue fever lasts about six to seven days, with a smaller peak of fever at the trailing end of the fever (the so-called \u201cbiphasic pattern\u201d). Clinically, the platelet count will drop until the patient's temperature is normal.",
                                "Cases of DHF also show higher fever, haemorrhagic phenomena, thrombocytopenia and haemoconcentration. A small proportion of cases leads to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which has a high mortality rate.",

If the patient is unable to maintain oral intake, supplementation with intravenous fluids may be necessary to prevent dehydration and significant hemoconcentration. A platelet transfusion is indicated if the platelet level drops significantly.",

However, one of the many ongoing vaccine development programs is the Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI [1]) which was set up in 2003 with the aim of accelerating the development and introduction of dengue vaccine(s) that are affordable and accessible to poor children in endemic countries.",
                                "Primary prevention of dengue mainly resides in eliminating or reducing the mosquito vector for dengue. Initiatives to eradicate pools of standing water (such as in flowerpots) have proven useful in controlling mosquito borne diseases.

Ubiquitin acts through its post-translational attachment (ubiquitinylation) to other proteins, where these modifications alter the function, location or trafficking of the protein, or targets it for destruction by the 26S proteasome (Burger and Seth (2004) Eur J Cancer. 40(15):2217-29).",

Ubiquitin has seven lysine residues, any one of which can be used to link ubiquitin molecules together, resulting in different structures that alter the target protein in different ways.",

For example, Lys(63)-linked poly-ubiquitinylation is known to be involved in DNA damage tolerance, inflammatory response, protein trafficking and signal transduction through kinase activation (Pickart and Fushman (2004) Curr Opin Chem Biol. 8(6):610-6). In addition, the length of the ubiquitin chain alters the fate of the target protein. Regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and histones are frequent targets of ubquitinylation (de Napoles et al., 2004. Dev Cell 7(5):663-76).",

There are many different E3 ligases, which are responsible for the type of ubiquitin chain formed, the specificity of the target protein, and the regulation of the ubiquitinylation process (Hatakeyama and Nakayama (2003) Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 302(4):635-45).",

The initial step involves production of an ubiquitin-adenylate intermediate. The second step transfers ubiquitin to the E1 active site cysteine residue, with release of AMP. This step results in a thioester linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and the E1 cysteine sulfhydryl group.",

E3 enzymes function as the substrate recognition modules of the system and are capable of interaction with both E2 and substrate. E3 enzymes possess one of two domains: * The HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain; * The RING domain (or the closely related U-box domain).",

Such agonists and antagonists may be used in the treatment, prevention or alleviation of dengue.",

Similarly, an antagonist may deactivate, or inhibit the activation of, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein to any degree. The protein may therefore be deactivated partially to any degree to its inherent, basal or background level of activity by an antagonist (partial antagonist) or fully to such a level (antagonist or full antagonist). The antagonist may deactivate the protein even further, for example to zero activity (inverse agonist).

One means for determining which sites interact with specific other proteins is a physical structure determination, e.g., X-ray crystallography or two-dimensional NMR techniques. These will provide guidance as to which amino acid residues form molecular contact regions. For a detailed description of protein structural determination, see, e.g., Blundell and Johnson (1976) Protein Crystallography, Academic Press, New York.",
                                "An alternative to rational design uses a screening procedure which involves in general allowing a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein to contact a candidate modulator and detecting an effect thereof. In general, such a method comprises producing appropriate cells which express the relevant protein or polypeptide on the surface thereof, optionally together with a partner protein, and contacting the protein or the cell or both with a candidate modulator, and detecting a change in the intracellular level of a relevant molecule.",
                                "A candidate compound may be tested for the ability to inhibit an activity of a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein. For example, a candidate molecule may be assayed by assaying its effect on proteasome activity. Such assays may make use of specific substrates, for example, the substrates provided in Proteasome Inhibitor Set (Calbiochem Cat. No. 539164), which contains 1 mg Proteasome Inhibitor I (Cat. No. 539160), 1 mg MG-132 (Cat. No. 474790), and 200 \u03bcg Lactacystin (Cat. No. 426100). A kit for assaying activity of the 26S proteasome is available as Cat.

The two proteins can be detected readily using sensitive antibody based tests which together with a host antigen such as NS1 (Non-Structural protein 1) can form the basis of a diagnostic assay that can be readily adapted into a test that can be used in the field.",

These are referred to for convenience as \u201cprotein sensitive markers\u201d, and these may be detected as a means of detecting activity of the relevant protein.",
                                "Cells which may be used for the screen may be of various types. Such cells include cells from animals, yeast, Drosophila or E. coli. Cells expressing the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein are then contacted with a test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.",
                                "Instead of testing each candidate compound individually with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein, a library or bank of candidate molecules may advantageously be produced and screened.",
                                "Where the candidate compounds are proteins, in particular antibodies or peptides, libraries of candidate compounds may be screened using phage display techniques. Phage display is a protocol of molecular screening which utilises recombinant bacteriophage. The technology involves transforming bacteriophage with a gene that encodes one compound from the library of candidate compounds, such that each phage or phagemid expresses a particular candidate compound. The transformed bacteriophage (which may be tethered to a solid support) expresses the appropriate candidate compound and displays it on their phage coat. Specific candidate compounds which are capable of binding to a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein, polypeptide or peptide are enriched by selection strategies based on affinity interaction. The successful candidate agents are then characterised. Phage display has advantages over standard affinity screening technologies. The phage surface displays the candidate agent in a three dimensional configuration, more closely resembling its naturally occurring conformation. This allows for more specific and higher affinity binding for screening purposes.",
                                "Another method of screening a library of compounds utilises eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant DNA molecules expressing a library of compounds. Such cells, either in viable or fixed form, can be used for standard binding-partner assays. See also Parce et al. (1989) Science 246:243-247; and Owicki et al. (1990) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 87;4007-4011, which describe sensitive methods to detect cellular responses. Competitive assays are particularly useful, where the cells expressing the library of compounds are contacted or incubated with a labelled antibody known to bind to a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein, such as 125I-antibody, and a test sample such as a candidate compound whose binding affinity to the binding composition is being measured. The bound and free labelled binding partners for the polypeptide are then separated to assess the degree of binding. The amount of test sample bound is inversely proportional to the amount of labelled antibody binding to the polypeptide.",
                                "Any one of numerous techniques can be used to separate bound from free binding partners to assess the degree of binding. This separation step could typically involve a procedure such as adhesion to filters followed by washing, adhesion to plastic following by washing, or centrifugation of the cell membranes.",
                                "Still another approach is to use solubilized, unpurified or solubilized purified polypeptide or peptides, for example extracted from transformed eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells. This allows for a \u201cmolecular\u201d binding assay with the advantages of increased specificity, the ability to automate, and high drug test throughput.",
                                "Another technique for candidate compound screening involves an approach which provides high throughput screening for new compounds having suitable binding affinity, e.g., to a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein, and is described in detail in International Patent application no. WO 84/03564 (Commonwealth Serum Labs.), published on Sep. 13 1984. First, large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate, e.g., plastic pins or some other appropriate surface; see Fodor et al. (1991). Then all the pins are reacted with solubilized polypeptide and washed. The next step involves detecting bound polypeptide. Compounds which interact specifically with the polypeptide will thus be identified.",
                                "The assays may simply test binding of a candidate compound wherein adherence to the cells bearing the relevant protein is detected by means of a label directly or indirectly associated with the candidate compound or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further, these assays may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by activation of the protein, using detection systems appropriate to the cells bearing the protein. Inhibitors of activation are generally assayed in the presence of a known agonist and the effect on activation by the agonist by the presence of the candidate compound is observed.",
                                "Further, the assays may simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein to form a mixture, measuring ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein (as the case may be) activity in the mixture, and comparing the protein activity of the mixture to a standard.",
                                "The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein cDNA, protein and antibodies to the protein may also be used to configure assays for detecting the effect of added compounds on the production of the relevant mRNA and protein in cells. For example, an ELISA may be constructed for measuring secreted or cell associated levels of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies by standard methods known in the art, and this can be used to discover agents which may inhibit or enhance the production of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway protein, interferon-related protein or NF-\u03baB-mediated cytokine/chemokine response protein (also called antagonist or agonist, respectively) from suitably manipulated cells or tissues. Standard methods for conducting screening assays are well understood in the art.",
                                "The screening assays may be conducted in vitro, as described above, or in vivo. In vivo assays may in particular be conducted using cells or suitable animal models for dengue.",
                                "Animal models for dengue include mice and monkeys. Such animal models are described in detail in Dengue Digest, volume 2, number 4, December 2005 (MICA (P) 193/06/2005; Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, Singapore); this document is available at http://www.nitd.novartis.com/includes/teasers/teaser_attaches/dengue_digest/DengueDigest_v2n4.pdf.

This value, called the fudge constant, is found by removing the trend in d as a function of s in moving windows across the data to reduce false positive results. As the statistic is not t-distributed significance is computed using a permutation test. Genes with a computed statistic larger than the threshold are called significant. The false discovery rate (FDR) associated with the given threshold can also be calculated from the permutation data.",
