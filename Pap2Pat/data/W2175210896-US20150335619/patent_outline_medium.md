### Establishing the Consequences of Rac1 and Cdc42 Activation and Overexpression in Human Ovarian Tumors.

- analyze effector activation dependence on Rac1 and Cdc42 dysregulation
- focus on four downstream effectors with key roles in tumor growth and metastasis

### General Approach to Analysis:

- conduct immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tumor tissue microarrays

### Pathway Activation:

- stain for markers using tumor microarrays
- assess marker expression and localization
- score staining by two pathologists
- analyze protein expression levels and distribution
- evaluate PAK1/pPAK1, WAVE3, WASP and IQGAP1 protein expression
- identify effectors correlated to GTPase activation status
- analyze GTPase activation and specific downstream pathways
- identify markers linked to ovarian tumor stage or grade
- test markers on tumor microarrays with linked patient outcome data
- correlate staining with predictors of adverse outcome
- analyze clinical results statistically
- use Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation
- use nonparametric Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact tests
- calculate survival curves and compare differences
- stratify using the Nottingham Prognostic Index
