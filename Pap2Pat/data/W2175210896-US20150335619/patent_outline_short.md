### Experimental Rationale and Approach

- motivate Rho GTPase as therapeutic target

### High Throughput Screens

- conduct high throughput screens for inhibitors and activators of small GTPases

### Rationale and Feasibility of the Examples:

- predict ovarian cancer metastasis dependence on Rac1/Cdc42-regulated pathways

### Further Examples

- identify R-enantiomers of naproxen and ketorolac as inhibitors of Rac1 and Cdc42

### Establishing the Consequences of Rac1 and Cdc42 Activation and Overexpression in Human Ovarian Tumors.

- analyze effector activation dependence on Rac1 and Cdc42 dysregulation

### General Approach to Analysis:

- conduct immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian tumor tissue microarrays

### Pathway Activation:

- stain for markers using tumor microarrays
- assess marker expression and localization
- score staining intensity and correlation with tumor parameters
- analyze protein expression levels and distribution
- evaluate effectors with respect to GTPase activation status
- identify markers linked to ovarian tumor stage or grade
- test markers on tumor microarrays with linked patient outcome data
- correlate staining with predictors of adverse outcome
- determine prognostic potential of activated GTPase markers
- motivate pathway activation
- describe testing of NSAIDs in preclinical models
- outline additional research using organotypic models
- summarize ex vivo studies on patient-derived tumor cells
- describe functional studies on cell response to test compounds
- outline statistical analysis for in vitro and in vivo studies
- describe in vivo studies using xenograft models
- summarize tumor analysis and tissue analysis
