                        "The Ras-homologous (Rho) family of small GTPases (Rac, Cdc42 and Rho) are key regulators of actin reorganization, cell motility, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion as well as of cell cycle progression, gene expression and apoptosis (FIG. 1) [1-8]. In many human cancers (including colon and breast), aberrant Rho-family signaling due to changes in the GTPase itself or in its regulation loops is a critical underpinning of tumor growth and survival, invasion and metastasis [9-13] (FIG. 1). RhoA and RhoC correlate with advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal dissemination [14; 15]. Although Rac1 and Cdc42 have been recognized as attractive therapeutic targets, specific Rae GTPase inhibitors while effective in culture [16; 17] have not been translated to clinical use and there are no established Cdc42 specific inhibitors. Lovastatin was shown to inhibit Rho GTPase and reduce ovarian metastasis in a xenograft model [15]. However, the use of statins to block GTPase membrane association has met with only modest success due to their broad spectrum inhibition of protein prenylation resulting in pleiotropic effects on many GTPases and pathways [18]. Furthermore, recent animal studies wherein the effects of geranylgeranlytransferase type I deficiency were analyzed revealed an unexpected hyperactivation of Rho GTPases and concomitant severe joint inflammation {Khan, 2011}. Thus, more specific agents for clinical application are urgently needed."

                                "The Ras-homologous (Rho) family of small GTPases (Rac, Cdc42 and Rho) are key regulators of actin reorganization, cell motility, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion as well as of cell cycle progression, gene expression and apoptosis (FIG. 1) [1-8]. In many human cancers (including colon and breast), aberrant Rho-family signaling due to changes in the GTPase itself or in its regulation loops is a critical underpinning of tumor growth and survival, invasion and metastasis [9-13] (FIG. 1). RhoA and RhoC correlate with advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal dissemination [14; 15]. Our own studies are the first to demonstrate dysregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 in ovarian tumor specimens (FIG. 2).",
                                "Although Rac1 and Cdc42 have been recognized as attractive therapeutic targets, specific Rac GTPase inhibitors while effective in culture [16; 17] have not been translated to clinical use and there are no established Cdc42 specific inhibitors. Lovastatin was shown to inhibit Rho GTPase and reduce ovarian metastasis in a xenograft model [15]. However, the use of statins to block GTPase membrane association has met with only modest success due to their broad spectrum inhibition of protein prenylation resulting in pleiotropic effects on many GTPases and pathways [18]. Thus, more specific agents for clinical application are urgently needed. The inventors identified two FDA approved drugs as inhibitors of Rac and Cdc42 that block ovarian cancer cell behaviors associated with tumor growth, dissemination and invasion (FIGS. 3-4) and display activity an intraperitoneal xenograft model (FIG. 6).",

First, the inventors investigate Rac1 and Cdc42 as therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer, a disease with limited treatment options. Effective targeting of key regulators of metastatic spread would have substantial positive impact on patient quality of life and duration of disease-free survival. Second, the inventors determine the mechanism of action of the novel Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibitors that will inform future development of targeted therapeutics. Third, testing FDA approved drugs for impact on ovarian cancer enable positive results to be rapidly translated to phase 1/2 clinical trials. Finally, results are expected to be applicable to numerous other cancers where Rac and Cdc42 and their downstream effectors are aberrantly activated.",

Cheminformatics identified structure-activity relationships that allowed generation of testable, mechanistic hypotheses for Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibition by stereoisomeric compounds, including naproxen and ketorolac. The lack of activity by >20 other NSAIDs against GTPase targets strongly suggests enantiomer-selective targeting of Rac1 and Cdc42 by R-naproxen and R-ketorolac and related derivatives (FIG. 10). Although it has been long recognized that R-enantiomers of NSAIDS are poor inhibitors of COX activity and lack COX-associated toxicities [21-29], little is known about potential pharmacologic activities or targets of the R-enantiomers. In one example, R-etodolac has no COX inhibitory activity, but does retard tumor development and metastasis in a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer [30]. The retinoid X receptor-\u03b1 was identified as the R-etodolac target, indicating enantiomer-dependent selectivity for a novel target.",

Despite substantial evidence for a causal role of aberrant Rac1 and/or Cdc42 activity in human cancers, these proteins have not been widely explored as therapeutic targets. The limited numbers of small molecule Rac inhibitors (NSC23766 and derivatives, EHT 1864) disrupt specific activator proteins (i.e. GEFs) that convert the GTPase to the active state, or perturb effector coupling to block downstream signaling (FIG. 1) [16; 31-33].",

Although Rac 1-targeted inhibitors display activity in cells and represent promising leads [16; 17; 33; 34], these compounds have not been translated to human use and Cdc42-specific inhibitors are not reported in the literature. In one aspect of the invention, the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs would offer a distinct advantage over new chemical entities requiring extensive toxicity and safety testing prior to clinical application. Thus, the R-enantiomers of naproxen and ketorolac (FDA approved in the racemic mixtures) and compounds listed in FIG. 10 offer an innovative approach for therapeutic targeting of Rac1 and Cdc42. The proposed studies provide critical information on the mechanism and feasibility of targeting Rac1 and Cdc42 with the R-enantiomers of naproxen and ketorolac. The expertise of the multi-disciplinary investigative team and collaborators (cheminformatics, bioinformatics, crystallography, biochemistry, cell biology and in vivo tumor modeling) fosters the advancement of these Rac1/Cdc42 targeted compounds with potential for rapid translation, and conversely validate Rac1 and Cdc42 as novel therapeutic targets in ovarian cancer."

The preliminary data generated offer the first evidence for dysregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase expression and activity in ovarian cancer (FIG. 2). Stage and grade dependent overexpression of Cdc42 and Rac1 proteins was based on immunohistochemical staining of human tumor samples. GTPase overexpression levels were highly significant for malignant, high-grade tumors (Rac1 (p=0.009) and Cdc42 (p<0.001)). Expression of a constitutively active splice variant Rac1b (first documented in breast tumors, [12]) was detected by qPCR and a GLISA activity assay showed both Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases highly active in fresh tumor isolates. These data provide the foundation for further experiments which are provided to delineate the impact of Rac1 and Cdc42 on measures of ovarian cancer disease and patient outcomes. Because activated Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate cell motility, survival and proliferation through multiple effectors (FIG. 1), we also investigate the status of effector proteins associated with the tumor cell behaviors that are altered by Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibitors (Table 1, FIG. 4). This information delivers mechanistic insight into the contributions of Rac1 and Cdc42 pathways to ovarian cancer and identify key downstream effector pathways associated with this disease. Access to a repository of tumor samples that are linked to patient outcomes through the Human Tissue Repository of the UNM NCI funded Cancer Center is important to deceipher these pathways."

R-, and S-ketorolac were identified for structure activity testing based on cheminformatics. Despite the common chemotype, S-naproxen and 6-MNA did not significantly inhibit Rac1 or Cdc42 indicating that GTPase inhibition is independent of the COX pathway. At nontoxic doses that are meaningful with respect to human serum levels at therapeutic doses Table 2 [39-47], the R-enantiomers of naproxen or ketorolac are more effective for inhibition of migration in SKOV3ip (FIG. 4A-B), OVCA 429 (not shown) and primary ovarian tumor cells isolated from ascites (not shown). The same structure activity relationship was observed for multicellular aggregate formation (FIG. 4C). Inhibition of proliferation did not exceed 50% with R-naproxen>S-naproxen or 6-MNA and little inhibition by R- or S-ketorolac (not shown). We tested >20 other common NSAIDS and did not detect inhibitory activity in vitro or in cells against Rac1 or Cdc42, nor any impact on ovarian cell migration or proliferation. Thus, from the structure activity relationships and selectivity, we conclude that the inhibitory actions of R-naproxen and R-ketorolac are due to an effect on novel Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase targets as first revealed by the molecular library screen and predicted by cheminformatics.",
                                "Virtual docking predicts that R-naproxen, but not S-naproxen can bind the GDP-bound pocket of Rac1 (FIG. 3B). In the model R-naproxen is stabilized through favorable H-bonds with Thr17 and Asp57, as well as through interaction with magnesium via the naproxen carboxyl group. Interestingly, Thr17 is the mutated residue in dominant negative forms of Rac1. The model predicts stabilization of the inactive GDP-bound GTPase and provides a testable hypothesis for a novel mechanism of action and the enantiomer selective differences in activity. As predicted by the enantiomer-selective inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity, we find that R-naproxen and the established Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 inhibit ovarian tumor cell proliferation, migration and MCA formation (FIG. 4A-C and data not shown) while S-naproxen and 6-MNA display little effect. Similarly, in an intraperitoneal xenograft model, animals administered R-naproxen displayed a 4-fold reduction in tumor number and a 36% decrease in total tumor burden while the S-naproxen and 6-MNA treated animals were similar to placebo controls (FIG. 6). These data demonstrate that the enantiomer-selective properties of R-naproxen are preserved in vivo."

In human cancers, p21 activated kinase (PAK) isoforms act as nuclear effectors and are critical for tumor angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and anchorage independent growth downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 [36; 48]. Elevated PAK1 levels are correlated with poor prognosis and aggressive ovarian cancers, making it an effector of particular interest [49; 50]. Cell-cell adhesion is modulated by active Rac1 and Cdc42 through IQGAP1-mediated disassembly of adherens junctions and nuclear translocation of beta catenin [38]. Rac/Cdc42/IQGAP1 are predicted to modify MCA formation and/or dispersal upon mesothelial contact. Mesothelial invasion and contact with the collagen-rich submesothelial matrix is likely mediated through WAVE3 and WASP effectors, which function in actin remodeling and invasion. Activated Rac1 is important for integrin-mediated lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, and tumor cell migration via",

WAVE3 and WASP pathways are downstream of activated Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively, and is important for discriminating if one or both GTPase pathways are active, and identify if functional redundancies amplify invasion or if one pathway predominates over another. The initial focus on these specific effectors is based on the cellular functions disrupted by R-naproxen, R-ketorolac and the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (FIG. 4-5) and tumor cell activities that are necessary for ovarian cancer metastatic success. Experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that comparative evaluation of a cohort of interrelated signaling molecules in patient tissue samples will demonstrate their utility individually or as a panel for serving as prognostic markers and provide supporting evidence for their use as therapeutic targets."

Scoring is conducted by two pathologists for the presence or absence of staining, localization and good correlation (within 1 quartile) with percent and intensity (0-3+) of epithelial staining. Staining intensity is dichotomized with high- or overexpression defined as above the median of the product of intensity times the percentage of epithelial cells stained.

Marker expression or localization, defined as above or below the median (intensity in compartment\u00d7the percentage of positive epithelial cells), is used to correlate staining with predictors of adverse outcome and overall or disease free survival. Additional arrays are prepared as needed, These experiments are used to determine the prognostic potential of activated GTPase markers alone or in combination with downstream effector pathways.",

                                "Clinical results are analyzed statistically. Pearson correlation (r) are used to compare Rac1/Cdc42 staining intensity to that of other markers, and results are confirmed using Spearman correlation. For the remaining analyses, staining intensity is dichotomized with high- or overexpression defined as above the median of the product of intensity times the percentage of epithelial cells stained. For continuous demographic data that are not normally distributed and for clinical and pathological data, respectively, nonparametric Wilcoxon and Fisher's exact tests are used. The LIFETEST procedure is used to calculate survival curves, and differences in survival are compared using the Log-rank test. P values\u22660.05 is considered statistically significant. To discern relationships between two target proteins (e.g. GTPase and specific effectors) exhibiting positive staining in matched samples we will stratify using the Nottingham Prognostic Index, which identifies risk using clinical and pathologic parameters groups, and then derive Cox proportional hazards and regression tree models. Training and validation sets are derived to test the ability to distinguish patients with poor outcomes from those with good or moderate outcomes and to calculate hazard ratios.",
                                "**Results and Alternative Approaches**",
                                "Rac1, Cdc42 and associated downstream effectors are predicted regulators of ovarian tumor cell growth and metastasis and we expect that in addition to predicting poor overall survival, one or both of the GTPases (Rac1/Cdc42) along with PAK1 (or pPAK1), WAVE3, WASP or IQGAP1 are associated with advanced stage and/or grade. If positive, we extend our studies to include analysis of matched primary tissue and metastatic lesions (US Biomax). Although our initial analysis of Rac1 and Cdc42 did not reveal significant differences in expression between serous and endometrioid tumors (not shown), it is possible that histotype associations are identified with one or more markers. For example, IQGAP activation leads to the disassembly of adherens junctions and nuclear translocation of beta catenin [38]. Analyses of nuclear beta-catenin identified a higher preponderance among endometriod as compared to serous carcinomas suggesting that activated beta-catenin might discriminate between ovarian cancer subtypes [56]. Each of the proposed markers has been tested in human tumor tissues. We use only antibodies that have been validated for IHC and conduct studies to optimize each marker individually. Additional tissues are available through the HTR is additional sample size is required to draw meaningful conclusions. PAK1 expression levels and altered distribution between nucleus and cytoplasm are important in tamoxifen resistant breast tumors and glioblastomas with poor prognosis [50; 57; 58]. Therefore, if PAK1 is a critical factor in ovarian cancer, expression is expected to be elevated and/or distribution between cytoplasm and nucleus may be altered in ovarian tumors as compared to normal tissues. As an alternative approach we look for altered PAK1 phosphorylation (correlated with poor outcome in glioblastoma) by western blot of primary tissue samples and taking into consideration best tissue procurement practices to preserve phosphoprotein profiles [58; 59]. WAVE3, if crucial in ovarian cancer, is expected to be increasingly expressed in the cytoplasm of ovarian tumor cells analogous to observations made for prostate cancer [51]. As surrogates for WAVE3 activation, matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-1 and -9, but not -2 should be upregulated and active. Diffuse overexpression of IQGAPI is correlated with high-grade ovarian tumors, and overexpression and increased membrane association are also linked to gastric and hepatocellular carcinoma [60-62]. As a corollary to IQGAP activation, we expect to find elevated nuclear beta-catenin. RT QPCR may also be used as an alternate or in parallel to protein expression measures for marker validation. The outcomes from these studies will establish essential relationships between GTPase activation and corresponding downstream pathways that are related to ovarian tumor cell behavior linked to metastatic dissemination. Importantly, these cell behaviors are modulated by the R-enantiomers of naproxen and ketorolac and the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 (FIG. 4). The inventors thus identify those pathways with greatest likelihood of response to GTPase targeted therapeutics to be tested.",
                                "**Rationale:**",
                                "Chemical Library Screens are conducted to identify inhibitors and activators of small GTPases [19]. Screening of the Prestwick chemical library of out-of-patent drugs identified the R-enantiomer of naproxen as active against Rac1 and Cdc42, which was confirmed in cellular assays; GLISAs that measure GTPase activation status (FIG. 3A), and proliferation, adhesion and migration assays that are reflective of pathways downstream of GTPase activation (FIG. 4). Using the Prestwick chemical library hit as a template, combined 2D- and 3D-based virtual screening techniques [63] to identify additional NSAIDs (not in the library) for testing was carried out. The nabumetone active metabolite, 6-MNA, ranked first on this list, as it shares a common chemotype with R- and S-naproxen. Since 6-MNA lacked Rac1 and Cdc42 activity (FIG. 3A and not shown), it was postulated that the rotational barrier around the carboxyl-substituted chiral center may explain differences in GTPase activity. Therefore the inventors performed additional similarity queries focused on a rotationally constrained carboxyl-substituted chiral center, and identified R- and S-ketorolac (also not in library) as matching enantiomeric candidates. R-ketorolac inhibited ovarian tumor cell migration with an IC50 of \u02dc10 \u03bcM (FIG. 4B).",
                                "Significant differences in the inhibitory activities of the naproxen series against GTPases were quantified (R-naproxen>S-naproxen>6-MNA) (FIG. 4A). The differences are thought to be a consequence of both rotational constraints around the chiral center imposed by the methyl group and a requirement for the aryl rings to be accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket that has a pyrrolizine that restricts rotation of a linked benzoyl ring. This is exemplified by recent crystallographic studies on naproxen binding to COX. S-naproxen displays optimal fit and inhibitory activity (50-70%) against COX enzymes based on crystallographic and enzymatic evaluations [22]. In contrast, R-naproxen displayed only 10-20% inhibition at >25 \u03bcM, which is explained based on the limited structural modification permitted by the NSAID binding pocket on COX enzymes [22]. In contrast to the COX enantiomeric specificity, virtual docking predicts R-naproxen, but not S-naproxen binding to the GDP-bound pocket of Rac1 (FIG. 3B). The model for R-naproxen binding to Rac1 predicts stabilization of the GDP-bound GTPase and provides a testable, novel mechanism for the inhibitory activities of the R-enatiomers of naproxen and ketorolac.",
                                "**General Approach:**",
                                "In vitro and cell based assays are conducted to: 1) establish the mechanism of naproxen and ketorolac inhibition using flow cytometry based equilibrium and kinetic assays; 2) monitor potential disruption of target interaction with GTPase regulatory and effector molecules in vitro; and 3) monitor drug treated cells for in vivo inhibition of pathways that are directly downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation.",

Each compound is tested in a log dose range corresponding to therapeutically relevant concentrations (average serum concentrations at standard dosing). The range for cell based testing of the naproxen series (R-, S- and 6 MNA) is 10-300 \u03bcM; ketorolacs (R- and S-) is 1-30 \u03bcM and NSC 23766 10-100 \u03bcM (positive control for Rac1 inhibition). For in vitro assays the concentrations extend into the nanomolar range.",

Non-competitive and uncompetitive binding mechanisms of NSAIDs and other small molecules to protein active sties are well described in the literature [64-68]. BODIPY(4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)-labeled nucleotide (GDP or GTP) binding to GSH-bead immobilized GST-Rac or GST-Cdc42 is quantitatively measured by flow cytometry as previously described [19; 69; 70]. Both equilibrium nucleotide binding in the presence or absence of increasing doses of each test compound (Table 2) and kinetics of nucleotide binding and dissociation with and without each compound is measured. The Kd for BODIPY-GTP/GDP of Rac1 and Cdc42 is \u02dc100 nM. Equilibrium competition experiments establish the EC50 by testing serial dilutions of each compound across concentrations (0.03 nM-30 \u03bcM), while holding the concentration of BODIPY GTP/GDP constant around the Kd. Dissociation measurements under equilibrium conditions is performed by allowing BODIPY-nucleotide binding to saturation (90 min) and adding an excess of unlabeled nucleotide or drug and monitoring the dissociation rate of the bound nucleotide in real time. Kinetic experiments measure BODIPY-GTP/GDP on rates over \u02dc250 s in the presence of compound concentrations well in excess of the EC50. Off rates are determined by prebinding GTPase and BODIPY-GTP/GDP and adding compound in excess of EC50 concentration. DMSO and excess unlabeled GTP/GDP controls are included in all experiments. Data are normalized and analyzed using Prism software as described in our published studies [19; 69; 70].",
                                "One of the predicted R-naproxen contact points is through a hydrogen bonding interaction with T17 of Rac1. Therefore, we test the impact of the classic dominant negative Rae T17N alone or in combination with D57A and D57N mutants on R-naproxen binding tested using BODIPY-GDP and flow cytometry as described above. Depending on the outcomes of the mechanism of inhibition studies on ketorolac, virtual docking studies is conducted and relevant site-directed mutants is generated as illustrated for R-naproxen (FIG. 3B).",

                                "The virtual docking studies predict a novel mechanism of R-naproxen action (stabilizing inactive, GDP-bound state) relative to known Rac1 inhibitors that bind to the switch regions and block guanine nucleotide exchange factor interactions or promote nucleotide release [17; 33; 89]. GTPases have two switch regions that undergo significant conformational changes based on which nucleotide (GDP or GTP) is bound. Effector binding is restricted to the GTP-bound conformation thus we anticipate disruption of this interaction. In vitro Pak effector binding assays measure the inhibitory effects of drug binding on GTPase-effector protein interactions [90]. Purified His-Rac1 or His-Cdc42 isbriefly preincubated (<15 min) with each test compound (0-100 \u03bcM), \u2212/+GDP or GTP\u03b3S addition. Recovery of GTPases in the active conformation is via PAK coated ELISA plates (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) and luminescent GTPase-specific antibody based readout or via addition of GST-PAK-PBD immobilized on GSH-beads followed by immunoblotting for bound GTPase fraction. Effects of naproxen and ketorolac on Tiam or Dbl GEF mediated activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively, is measured using a kinetic, 96-well plate based mant-GTP binding assay in routine use in the lab. Tiam GEF is measured in the presence of ascorbyl stearate [91]. Dbl and reagents for GEF assay are purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. NSC23766 serves as a positive control for GEF inhibition,",

                                "The mechanism of inhibition of compounds according to the present invention are determined from flow cytometry experiments. In an uncompetitive inhibition mechanism the drug would bind only to the nucleotide-bound GTPase and thus would be expected to decrease the apparent Kd and decrease the Bmax. A noncompetitive inhibition mechanism would allow both the nucleotide and drug to bind simultaneously, but independently and thus without any change to the apparent Kd. However, since the bound inhibitor would block enzyme activity, Bmax should decrease. A competitive mechanism is considered unlikely, but would be associated with an increase in Kd and no change in Bmax. Both Rac1 and Cdc42 bind to the PAK effector protein. Binding assays in the presence of GDP and GTP alone will provide minimum and maximum binding activities. Binding in the presence of increasing doses of drugs will establish effects on regulatory and effector protein interactions. The composite studies lend insight into mechanism of action and inform plans for crystallographic analyses. One-way ANOVA of duplicates and repeated measures to 95% confidence intervals identify actives.",

Preliminary data demonstrate R-naproxen inhibits Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activities in OvCA cell lines (429 and 433). However, direct GTPase inhibitory activity for the ketorolac series, although expected based upon the initial results, remains to be established. GLISAs in are highly specific, quantitative, can be performed with small sample sizes (<50 \u03bcg of cell lysate per assay, compared to 1-10 mg required for conventional PAK binding assay) and have excellent reproducibility. To assess the inhibitory effects of the small molecules in Table 2, preincubate cells for 15-60 min (times that establish detection of acute GTPase inhibition) with varying concentrations of each compound as described. NSC23766 serves as a positive control for Rac1 inhibition. The optimal time for measuring maximal EGF-stimulated Rae and Cdc42 activation in Swiss 3T3 cells and OVCA429 cells is after 2 min EGF treatment (FIG. 3A). Activated RhoA is also measured by GLISA following lysophosphatidic acid stimulation as an additional specificity control as needed. These analyses establish cellular IC50s (for R-naproxen and R-ketorolac relative to S-enantiomers and control compounds). Based on data, expectation of the enantiomer selectivity to be R>S, the reverse of what has been established for the COX enzymes [22].",

Preliminary data demonstrate that R-naproxen, but not 6 MNA treatment of OvCA cell lines inhibits Rac and Tiam membrane association consistent with the inhibition of Rac1 activity measured by GLISA (FIG. 5A-C). In addition, the formation of Cdc42-dependent, actin-based invadopodia that are crucial for matrix degradation and invasion [92; 93] is also significantly reduced by R-naproxen, but not by 6 MNA (FIG. 5D-E).",

The markers to be studied are the same as those that are monitored by IHC in tumor samples and allow direct testing of the impact of drug treatment on key pathways that are downstream of GTPase activation to gauge how well they are targeted by GTPase inhibition. Molecules/pathways analyzed include: a) membrane localization of GTPases (Rac1 and Cdc42) and regulatory proteins (Tiaml, Dbl GEFs) as measures of GTPase activation; b) IQGAP/beta catenin localization to adherens junction or nucleus as markers of stable cell-cell adhesion vs. EMT; c) PAK/pPAK as markers of pathways downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 that alter proliferation and migration; d) WAVE and WASP membrane association in conjunction with lamellopodia and filopodia/invadopodia formation as measures of acute actin remodeling needed for cell migration and invasion. SiRNA knockdown of Rac1 and Cdc42 alone or in combination is used to verify that the drug responses depend on inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 function.",

Therefore, it is believed that R-naproxen and R-ketorolac have demonstrable impact on biological processes required for ovarian cancer metastatic success (FIG. 7). In support of this hypothesis, R-naproxen decreased the number of implanted tumors in a xenograft animal model using athymic nude mice injected with human ovarian tumor cells adapted to intraperitoneal growth (SKOVip; obtained through a formal MTA from MD Anderson). Treatments were incorporated into transgenic dough (BioServe, Frenchtown, N.J.) and animals were dosed twice per day to achieve established therapeutic serum levels [73]. Animals were given placebo dough or dough containing R-naproxen, S-naproxen or 6 MNA. After sacrifice, animals fed R-naproxen exhibited a 4-fold reduction in tumor number (FIG. 6) and a 36% decrease in total tumor burden (not shown), while the 6MNA and S-naproxen treated animals were similar to the placebo controls.

Animals injected with SKOV3ip cells typically display \u02dc20-30 metastatic implants at 20 days post implantation and animals succumb to disease at \u02dc40 days with 80-100 overt peritoneal metastases [115]. Mice inoculated with OVCA 429 cells display a phenotype of large (>1.5 cm3) solid tumors that adhere loosely to fat in the pelvic region, intestine, and/or omentum in addition to multiple smaller tumors (<0.25 cm3) accumulating in the same three areas, with ascitic fluid accumulation [117]. Two treatment procedures are followed. 1) Introduce tumor cells and allow 7 days for the cells to engraft before treatment as a model of small molecule impact on residual disease. 2) Mice receive the intervention for two days before tumor cell inoculation to approximate the impact of small molecules on recurrent disease including tumor growth, metastatic implantation and invasive peritoneal lesions. The dose of R-naproxen, S-naproxen and 6-MNA is 20 mg/kg (oral) to approximate prescription dose levels in humans and these are common doses for naproxen treatment in mice [132-136].

                                "Excised tumors are evaluated for target enzyme inhibition, effector analysis, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Following sacrifice, tumor tissue is collected and then fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin solution for immunohistology or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analyzed. Tumor masses from and ascites cells is analyzed for GTPase activity by GLISA assay (Rac1, Cdc42), COX activity, proliferation index, apoptotic index, and mean vessel density. The GLISA assays have been used successfully in isolated tissues (Cytoskeleton, Inc) and would provide a direct measure of effective target inhibition. Alternatively, if greater tissue sample is required, Rac1 and Cdc42 activity is measured by Pakl pull down assays from tumor lysates. COX activity is measured by ELISA. Proliferation and apoptotic indices based on tissue staining for Ki67 and TUNEL staining, respectively. The proliferation index is defined as percent cells positive for Ki67 in five randomly selected high power fields per tumor. Apoptotic index is determined by the number of apoptotic tumor cells in five randomly selected high-power fields exclusive of necrotic areas. Because COXs and Rho-family GTPases are involved in angiogenesis [140-148], we will measure mean vessel density (MVD) by counting CD31-positive vessels as described previously [149].

                                "For animal studies, a 5% ANOVA test of no differences in means based on a sample of 8 per group has 82% (81%) power to detect a moderate effect size of 0.60 (0.63), where the effect size is given by the SD of the group means divided by the within group SD. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests is used to compare time to events. Repeated measures ANOVA are used to compare longitudinally measured in vivo growth parameters. Parametric or non-parametric ANOVA is used to compare tumor growth, immunochemistry and tissue measurements across groups at each time point. The mean number of lesions is compared across groups using ANOVA, treating the responses as Poisson counts. The extent of invasion and size of lesions are categorical responses and is compared across groups using chi-squared tests of homogeneity and logistic regression, respectively. Multiple lesions per site is handled using generalized estimating equations to give valid statistical tests that account for within-individual clustering. Tumor tissue measurements are summarized treated as for in vitro cell measurements.",

                                "The studies focus on the impact of identified small molecules on distinct mechanisms of metastasis in ovarian cancer (FIG. 7) and obtain detailed information adhesive events (cell:cell for MCAs or cell: mesothelium ex vivo and in vivo), invasion, growth and survival. Parallel experiments conducted in monolayer culture assess proliferation, apoptosis, migration, in vitro invasion and quantification of E-cadherin surface expression and endocytosis using techniques and approaches that are well documented in publications [121-125; 150; 151] to complement the findings obtained in 3D and organotypic models. Based on our preliminary findings, we predict that the R-enantiomers and NSC23776 will decrease MCA formation, cell migration and cell invasion because actin nucleation and polymerization are proximal targets for Rac1/Cdc42 through activation of effector molecules such as IQGAP & PAKs. However, MMPs are additionally required for invasion and COX activity is implicated in MMP expression [151] so 6MNA and the S-enantiomers may partially block invasive anchoring. We predict that the impact of small GTPase inhibition by NSC23766, R-naproxen or R-ketorolac will be most evident in the IP metastatic models where RacI and Cdc42 signaling play key roles in adhesive and actin-cytoskeleton-mediated events crucial to metastatic success (such as implantation and invasive lesions. The information on effective concentrations guides dose parameters for the future transition to Phase 1/2 clinical trials. If direct measurements of Rac1/Cdc42 activity in conjunction with effector activation reveal poor inhibition, we will adjust doses accordingly. While not all patient-based tumor cells will establish in short term culture or xenograft models, but with 60 cases/year the numbers are sufficient to validate the impact of the novel drugs on tumor-relevant endpoints. Promising results ex vivo and with tumor cell lines in vivo, will extend the studies to include IP xenograft studies using primary tumor cells from patients.",
                                "One concern is that S-ketorolac may cause gastrointestinal lesions in the course of the in vivo studies since these experiments will exceed the length of time recommended for human use of ketorolac. The GI toxicity in mice is dose dependent and low, but detectable at the proposed dose [23; 75]. Necropsy and histopathology are performed on any animals that succumb before conclusion of the tumor studies using services provided through the Cancer Center Animal Research Core. We do not anticipate problems with R-ketorolac because there is little interconversion between the R- and S-forms in rodents, and none detectable in humans [26]. Similarly, S-naproxen is not significantly subject to epimerization [29].",
                                "Because R-naproxen inhibits Rac1 and Cdc42, these studies will not clarify whether targeted inhibition of Rac1 or Cdc42 is more advantageous for antitumor activity in ovarian cancer. If antitumor activity is verified, follow up is with targeted knockdown of Rac1 or Cdc42 using Tet-inducible shRNA (ClonTech) or lentiviral approaches to compare the impact of targeting the GTPases singly or in combination. We recognize that as is true for all small molecules, the test compounds may have additional, as yet unidentified targets that could contribute to biologic response. By using positive controls for small GTPases (NSC23766, established Rac1 inhibitor), controls for response due to COX inhibition and incorporation of Rac1 or Cdc42 knockdown strategies we are able to address this possibility. In addition, a future goal is to test relevant small molecules in the TgMISIIR TAg mouse model of ovarian cancer to highlight potential impact on early disease."

                        "The experimental studies described herein represent the first efforts to investigate the potential of Rac1 and Cdc42 as therapeutic targets in metastatic ovarian cancer. The compounds identified, among others described, are FDA approved as the racemic mixture. Therefore, proof of concept that therapeutic targeting of Rac1 and/or Cdc42 confers anti-tumor benefit for ovarian cancer in vivo offer the potential for rapid clinical translation. An observational report notes that presurgical administration of R,S-ketorolac reduced cancer recurrence rates in breast cancer patients [152]. Thus, suggesting even short-term adminstration of racemic mixtures are of benefit. Establishing the R-enantiomers as drugs with novel targets combined with the possibility of obtaining R-enantiomer pure compounds for clinical studies through the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) program will open new opportunities for drug development in a disease with limited options."
