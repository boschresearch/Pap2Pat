                        "Due to the exceptional electronic and thermal properties, graphene is believed to be a key material for bolometry, calorimetry, and photon detection. Since it is only one atom thick, its heat capacity goes well below the traditionally synthesized thin films, and its thermal conductivity can be controlled by placing graphene on different substrates. However, despite its relatively simple electronic structure, mechanisms that facilitate heat transfer away from the electronic degrees of freedom in graphene still remain to be understood. For example, previous transport measurements in graphene encapsulated within boron nitride identified that electron-phonon coupling in graphene bulk is a dominant source of electron thermalization. Yet, these experiments suggest a surprisingly large electron-phonon coupling strength: hundreds of times larger than the theoretical predictions. Additionally, recent local thermometry measurements in related systems highlight the importance of the localized defects in electron cooling.",
                        "As described herein, the thermal response of graphene can be measured by integrating it within a multi-terminal superconducting device coupled to a microwave resonator. In contrast with typical critical current measurements that involve switching between superconducting and resistive states, changes in Josephson inductance caused by heating are measured directly. This approach allows the thermal response to be continuously monitored with minimal back-action and further allows the thermalization of both electrons and holes to be separately probed. For both carrier types, power-law scaling of the thermal conductance has been found to be consistent with a resonant electronic scattering mechanism that occurs at the interface between graphene and the superconducting leads. The insights obtained provide an understanding of thermalization pathways in superconducting graphene circuits, which may be important for understanding and developing graphene-based thermal detectors.",
                        "Presented herein is a device architecture for straightforward design and readout of arrays of frequency-multiplexed graphene photodetectors. The detection mechanism allows operation at the lowest temperatures available to a dilution refrigerator (<100 mK), where graphene photodetectors are most sensitive, all the way up to 10 K, where liquid-helium cryostats may be employed in place of expensive dilution refrigerators. Further, the readout mechanism is nondestructive, allowing the state of the photodetector to be continuously monitored with minimal back-action from the readout chain. Finally, the device architecture allows for in situ frequency tuning to compensate for non-idealities in device fabrication and/or to modify spectral bandwidth in real time. Taken together, the benefits of this device architecture present a significant step towards readout of arrays of graphene photodetectors for tackling the most difficult problems in radio astronomy, quantum information processing, and dark matter detection.",

                        "Graphene photodetectors present an opportunity to push photon detection to the mid-infrared, far-infrared, and microwave regimes. Exploiting graphene's unprecedented low-carrier density, restricted thermalization, and relative ease of fabrication, substantial effort in the last decade has gone into developing graphene-based, broadband detectors of individual photons and photon flux.",
                        "When graphene is contacted using superconducting electrodes, the resulting Josephson coupling and the corresponding supercurrent are highly dependent on electron temperature. Accordingly, graphene Josephson junctions (gJJs) are particularly promising for detecting ultra-small thermal responses at milli-Kelvin temperatures. Moreover, gJJs can be tuned in many ways, as graphene couples well with a variety of superconductors to form highly transparent junctions, enabling supercurrents to persist over several microns.",
                        "Using different superconductors, junction geometries, and operation at different carrier densities allows for a range of specific optimizations needed to detect small heat and optical signals. To achieve the highest sensitivity, for example, one can choose to operate at the lowest temperatures and employ superconductors with a small superconducting gap, similar to the approach that is taken in conventional superconducting nanowire-based detectors. If a large dynamic range is required, tuning the critical currents in graphene junctions by controlling carrier density can provide another degree of freedom providing additional flexibility in design.",
                        "Despite the significant progress in integrating graphene with superconducting nanoelectronic devices, the understanding of thermalization of electrons and holes in these systems is still incomplete. Furthermore, conventional readout methods of graphene photodetectors have required lengthy averaging times or destructive, non-continuous monitoring. Such methods have largely been focused on readout of individual devices. Scaling graphene photodetectors from individual devices to arrays may need a mechanism capable of simultaneous, fast, and continuous readout of thousands of devices with minimal back-action from the measurement chain.",
                        "In many transport measurements, thermalization in gJJs is primarily driven by the electron-phonon interaction in the graphene bulk, as the diffusion of unpaired electrons into the metallic leads is suppressed due to a superconducting gap. However, in the case where graphene is encapsulated within hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), there are significant discrepancies between the deduced values of electron-phonon coupling from the experimental thermalization rates and theoretical predictions.",
                        "Such a discrepancy is not expected for materials with a simple band structure such as graphene, where both the electronic and phonon spectrum can be readily calculated. Further, recent scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) experiments, which provide spatially-resolved thermal imaging of graphene, have revealed that when electronic transport in graphene is ballistic, signatures of electron thermalization are observed only near physical edges, local defects, and close to metallic contacts. However, signatures of such boundary mediated thermalization have not been evident in transport measurements.",
                        "Some embodiments described herein provide for a broadband radiation sensor that may include a resonantly-coupled graphene superconductor\u2014normal conductor\u2014superconductor (SNS) junction. The functionality of such a broadband radiation sensor is demonstrated by performing thermal measurements on a high-quality graphene sample in which the temperature is read out with a superconducting microwave resonator. This has enabled, for the first time, observation of a scaling exponent that is consistent with resonant electron-phonon coupling theory. The described device architecture can be used for graphene-based, far-infrared and microwave regime detector pixels that can be scaled into large arrays.",
                        "In some embodiments, microwave signals are sent down a measurement line, transmitted past the on-chip resonator/graphene device, and amplified for readout. The resonator/graphene device presents an electrical impedance to the measurement line that diminishes microwaves signals that are transmitted past the resonator at a particular resonant frequency. This yields a resonance feature as a function of microwave signal frequency. This resonance feature can be continuously monitored with minimal disturbance to the graphene flake.",
                        "In some embodiments, a SNS-type Josephson Junction is integrated into a graphene flake. The SNS junction is comprised of two metallic leads, where the metal is a superconducting material such as aluminum, separated by some small length of graphene. The SNS junction presents an electrical impedance to an on-chip resonator fabricated from sputtered Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN). The electrical impedance of the SNS junction depends, with high sensitivity, on the temperature and the carrier density of the graphene flake. The normal conductor of the SNS junction may be comprised of Van der Waals structures including monolayer and multi-layer structures, a semiconductor-based structure, or metallic structures. The superconductor of the SNS junction may be comprised of aluminum or other low critical temperature (Tc) superconductors, niobium or other mid-range-Tc superconductors, or high-Tc superconductors.",
                        "In some embodiments, changes in the electrical impedance of the SNS junction change the boundary condition of the resonator, which changes the resonant frequency of the resonance feature. Therefore, a change in the temperature or carrier density of the graphene flake changes the resonant frequency of the resonance feature. These changes in resonant frequency can be continuously and sensitively monitored by the measurement line.",
                        "Embodiments described herein demonstrate that graphene can provide the basis for a scalable, far-IR or microwave detector-array technology. Its utility is based on the optimization of three key attributes: responsivity, thermal isolation, and multiplexing. Their optimization, in turn, may benefit from simultaneous or concurrent optimization of multiple, mutually-interacting parameters. The hBN-encapsulated graphene device described herein provides large supercurrents, sub-microsecond response times, and a separate heater and readout port for broad-spectrum energy detection. The superconducting resonator that is employed permits straightforward frequency multiplexing of many devices on a single feedline.",
                        "While detectors based on junction switching (between the zero and finite voltage state) benefit from simplicity of fabrication and readout, they are inherently threshold detectors. Accordingly, they may only register a \u201ccount\u201d when the incident photon energy is above a given threshold, and therefore forfeit the possibility of energy spectroscopy provided by the linear, resonantly-coupled graphene detector architecture described herein. Furthermore, threshold detectors intrinsically provide a slower response, which is limited by the cooling and resetting of the junction after a photon absorption event. The graphene-based detectors provided by embodiments of the present invention enable a variety of novel applications, including dark matter detection, and benefit from simultaneous or concurrent optimization of all of these aforementioned properties.",
                        "Graphene-insulator-superconductor (G-I-S) junctions and superconductor-graphene-superconductor (S-G-S) junctions operate according to different physical principles, which leads to important differences in fabrication processes, device architecture, and measurement readout. A physical phenomenon occurring in an S-G-S junction is the flow of supercurrent between the superconducting leads that is mediated by electron-hole reflections at the graphene/superconductor boundaries. In this case, Cooper pairs (paired electrons or holes in the superconductor) are removed from one superconducting lead and deposited in the other when mediated by the transport of unpaired electrons or holes in the graphene flake.",
                        "By contrast, normal current (non-supercurrent) flow occurs in G-I-S junctions. In this case, current is mediated by high-energy electrons (or holes) in graphene that tunnel through the insulating layer into the superconductor as quasiparticles. Increases in the normal current can be achieved by applying a positive bias voltage or increasing the graphene temperature since both of these processes increase the number of electrons with energy above the threshold tunneling energy set by the gap energy of the superconductor.",
                        "The difference in physical mechanisms between these two types of junctions leads to differences in fabrication processes. S-G-S junctions are typically fabricated by etching into a stack of hBn/graphene/hBn to expose the edge of the graphene flake, followed by deposition of a superconducting metal to create a low-impedance, high-transparency contact between the graphene and superconductor. The insulating hBn layers reduce disorder in the graphene flake and enhance mobilities of the charge carriers.",
                        "By contrast, G-I-S junctions are often fabricated by stacking a graphene flake and hBn layer on a superconductor to ensure an uninterrupted insulating layer between the graphene and the superconductor. This produces a high-impedance contact between the graphene flake and the superconductor. Etching the hBn layer can sometimes be performed to thin the hBn layer and improve the probability of quantum tunneling, but direct contact between the graphene and superconductor will render this type of junction unusable. Other methods of fabricating these junctions exist.",
                        "The difference in impedance between these two types of junctions lead to different device architectures and readout methods. Due to the Josephson current-voltage relations, an 5-G-S junction produces an effective inductance when incorporated into an electrical circuit. This fact, combined with its low impedance, mean that it is operated in series with a resonator, so that changes in flake temperature can be transduced into shifts of the resonant frequency. These frequency shifts can be detected in phase/amplitude shifts of S-parameter measurements or in the amplitude shifts of transmitted/reflected tone. By contrast, G-I-S junctions appear as an effective resistance when incorporated into electrical circuits. Due to its high impedance, it is typically placed in parallel with a resonator. Temperature shifts of the graphene flake are transduced into changes in resistance, which are subsequently transduced into shifts of the quality factor of the resonance.",

For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the examples.
