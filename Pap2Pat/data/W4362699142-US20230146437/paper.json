    "title": "Self-Assembled Copolymeric Nanowires as a New Class of 3D Scaffold for Stem Cells Growth and Proliferation",
    "date": "2023-04-06",
    "abstract": "Stem cell therapy has emerged as the most vibrant area of research, due to the capacity of stem cells for self-renewal and differentiation into different types of cell lines upon their culture. But lately, scientists become increasingly aware of the limitations of conventional 2D culture and stem cell culture media, due to several key drawbacks associated with this model, such as immune response upon transplantation, animal pathogen contamination, and complication, during developmental studies due to undefined factors in the cultural media. In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a new type of polymeric 3D scaffold based on the self-assembly of a star-like amphiphilic copolymer of poly(caprolactone)\u2013poly(ethylene oxide) unit into nanowires (nanofibers), that have a scale similar to the native extracellular matrix and are capable of mimicking the extracellular microenvironment where the functional properties of stem cells can be observed and manipulated. The obtained data showed that polymeric-based nanofibers can be used as a 3D scaffold for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) growth without losing their stem cell phenotype. The results obtained suggest that the polymeric 3D scaffolds (nanofibers) not only support stem cells\u2019 growth and proliferation but also preserve the mESC pluripotency.",

                "Polymeric nanofibers represent an exciting class of materials that has drawn substantial attention recently, particularly in the field of stem cell and tissue engineering. Such emphasis can be interpreted by the ability of these materials to mimic the arrangement of fibers and fibrils of the extracellular matrix (ECM), making them suitable for a wide range of medical applications, in particular stem cell-based tissue engineering and medical textile materials [1]. Increasingly, researchers believe that stem cell technology has the potential to drastically change our approach concerning disease treatment [2,3]. Unfortunately, stem cells are very sensitive to micro and nanoenvironment changes, which make finding a material that mimics the embryonic stem cell niche properly a major challenge. During the past few years, many attempts have been made to build an appropriate artificial scaffold that mimics the stem cell niche and allows a better understanding and improvement of stem cell therapies. For instance, Webster et al. [4] demonstrated the ability of carbon nanotubes in a polymer matrix to support orthopedic implants and neuronal cell growth and function. When different cell types are cultured on carbon nanofibers reinforced polycarbonate urethane composite, they can result in an increase in neuronal cell numbers and the case of osteoblast cells, further bone-forming. Despite the huge success of this system, the fate of carbon nanotubes remains unclear due to safety concerns that these materials still present in terms of toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [5].",
                "Self-assembled peptide-based animal sources into nanofibrillar materials have been widely investigated recently for selective application, such as differentiation and growth in both in vitro and in vivo for a wide range of cells, such as neural progenitor cells [6,7], primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells [8], mouse osteoblastic cells [9], and human mesenchymal cells [10].",
                "A nanofiber network of a self-assembling RAD16-I peptide scaffold developed by Garreta et al. [11] proved to enhance the formation of an mES cell niche and remarkably enhance the frequency of Oct4 positive mES cell colonies compared to the ones cultured on the 2D system suggesting that the 3D-system culture condition enhanced the maintenance of cells with the embryonic phenotype in comparison with 2D scaffold. The 3D biomaterial-based scaffold mentioned earlier seems to have great potential; unfortunately, problems related to the formation of such constructs in living organisms have not yet been investigated in-depth. Also, the immunogenicity of such constructs still constitutes a hurdle difficult to overcome. Recently 3D scaffolds based on synthetic polymers gained a lot of intention mainly because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and flexibility in terms of functionalization with desired biomolecules. Also, polymeric materials can generate a more favorable microenvironment for stem cell development, by providing a complex network of nanofibers, gaps, and pores through which oxygen, hormones, and nutrients are delivered and waste products filtered away [12]. Nur-E-Kamal et al. [13] reported the construction of a 3D nanofibrillar surface composed of polyamide nanofibers (Ultra-Web) that can promote the proliferation and self-renewal of mES cells. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining of mES cell colonies revealed that stained colonies were significantly larger for mES cells cultured on Ultra-Web compared to the mES cells cultured on plain coverslips, which provides evidence that dimensionality plays an important role in maintaining stemness in proliferating mES cells. Ouyang et al. [14] showed the potential of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibrous-based matrix to grow and maintain undifferentiated ES cells. The use of bioconjugate amphiphilic copolymers to generate 3D scaffolds for stem cell growth and differentiation is a fairly new concept when compared with what has been developed by other groups so far, especially in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Therefore, the key advantage of this new synthetic structure over the existing 2D scaffolds is its ability to resemble a living body than any other cell culture system, which means that the new synthetic structure can provide a more conducive microenvironment for stem cell culture (or tissue engineering), which eliminates animal byproducts and their deleterious effects, normally occurring in traditional culture systems.",
                "Here, we report the synthesis of poly(caprolactone)-bpoly(ethylene oxide) star-polymer and the capability of this new biodegradable amphiphilic copolymer to be converted into a 3D scaffold (nanofiber network) through a molecular self-assembly process to support mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) growth and later their differentiation. In this study, we evaluated the capacity of the mesenchymal stem cells (mESCs) to adhere to fibronectin-conjugated nanofibers and proliferate without losing their stem cell phenotype. We have achieved this by measuring the proliferation of the cells and also quantifying the stem cell markers and cell pluripotency features."

                        "Nanofibers. The goal of the present work was to develop a new artificial 3D scaffold to support stem cell growth by converting amphiphilic copolymers into a 3D network of nanowires using a molecular self-assembly process. The assembly of these copolymers into nanofiber was achieved as follows: poly(caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) starpolymer (40 mg) were dissolved in DMF, and the solution was then stirred for 3 hr. Deionized water was added at a rate of 10 \u00b5l every 5 s for a total of 1.6 ml to induce the nanowire formation. The aqueous solution was then dialyzed against deionized water for 4 days. Throughout the last step, the synthetic amphiphilic copolymer, undergo self-assembly into wellordered and homogenous soft nanowires, often 1-2 \u00b5m long and 30 nm diameter (Figure 1(a)); at high concentration, these nanowires tend to be predisposed to form 3D scaffold with tiny gaps and pores (Figure 1(b)), through which oxygen, hormones, and nutrients can be delivered and waste products to be filtered away to increase in vivo like characteristic of these artificial structures [15]. To identify the mechanism by which these nanowires are fashioned, a series of experiments was conducted using TEM and a small single neutron diffraction technique. The data collected from these technics suggest that the building mechanism of the nanofiber assembly depends on many factors: the solvent-removal procedure, polymer concentration, polymer, and solvent nature. In general, the micellization of amphiphilic materials can be triggered during the dialyzed process (water removal), where slow removal of the organic phase provokes a micellization process that later leads to the formation of the nanowires. By using small-angle scattering instrument or small-angle neutron diffraction (SAND) analysis, we can observe the dependence of the nanowire formation rate on the ratio of water/organic solvent present in the solution, as depicted in Figure 2. The cylindrical shapes can be observed in a lower percentage of the organic solvent compared with water.",
                        "The impact of the polymer concentration was evaluated by SAND. A series of samples with different copolymer concentrations were prepared. As depicted in Figure 3, the neutron diffraction plots clearly show that the transition from spherical micelles to nanofibers depends heavily on the initial concentrations of the polymer. Therefore, the higher the polymer concentration in the solution, the faster the nanofiber formation. Furthermore, the transition of the copolymer macromolecules from spherical shapes to elongated nanofibers was probed by TEM, and the images show clearly, that samples with low concentration (0.1-0.20 mg/ml of the PCL-PEO+ DMF 15 mg/ml 0.15 ml DMF + 0.7 ml D2O (0.75 mg/ml) 0.1 ml DMF + 0.75 ml D2O (0.75 mg/ml) 0.05 ml DMF + 0.8 ml D2O (0.75 mg/ml)",

However, when the concentration reached 0.7 mg/ml, we started to observe the formation of cylindrical-shaped micelles. The increase in polymer concentration provokes a significant increase in intermicelle interactions prompting a series of fusions between micelles (micelle stacking) that leads to the elongation of the cylindrical-shaped micelle into nanofibers (Figure 4), which become with time the dominant structures in the solution. It is also interesting to note that once the fibers are formed, they are stable in water even if overall polymer concentrations are below the critical fiber concentration, which is 0.7 mg/ml. The last factor that we believe has a big impact on the size and shape of the nanofibers is the molecular structure of the amphiphilic copolymer. It is well-known that the self-assembly of the amphiphilic copolymer into nanowires depends mainly on the weight fraction w of the hydrophilic block relative to the total copolymer molecular weight. For poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based diblock in aqueous solution, where w EO \u223c 45%-55% leads to the assembly of main nanowires, but higher w gives predominantly spherical micelles, and lower w yields vesicles [16]."

                        "Stem cells and developmental biologists have become increasingly aware of the limitations of conventional 2D stem cell culture, due to several key drawbacks of these systems. In this respect, copolymeric nanofibers covered with fibronectin may represent an alternative solution for these problems. The key advantage of this new synthetic structure, over the existing 2D systems, is its ability to be more like a living body than any other cell culture system, which means that the new synthetic structure can provide a more conducive microenvironment for stem cell growth. The first step toward the fabrication of this artificial scaffold is the synthesis of bioconjugated nanowires with fibronectin. Fibronectin is a cell-surface and serum-derived glycoprotein and has numerous effects on cells in vitro. At concentrations as low as 1-50 \u00b5g/ml, it can promote the adhesion, spreading, and migration of fibroblasts and certain other cells and induce transformed cells to flatten and appear normal. Additionally, fibronectin can influence the differentiation of chondrocytes and myoblasts. The preparation of bioconjugated nanowires with human fibronectin was carried out by conjugating PEG 20000 with the fibronectin to form PEG-fibronectin, followed by mixing PEG-fibronectin with the amphiphilic copolymer start with a ratio of 1-3.3. The resulting solution was then placed in a dialysis cassette and dialyzed against deionized water for 4 days at 4\u00b0C to yield a fibronectin-conjugated nanowire. To confirm the presence of fibronectin on the surface of the nanowires, fibronectinconjugated nanowires were first deposited on the surface of the petri dish, then a solution of amine-reactive fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester) was added to the petri dish and left for 4 hr, to allow the tethering reaction between the dye and the proteins to occur. After several washing, images of fibronectin conjugated nanowires were taken by fluorescence microscope. A control experiment was performed using block copolymer nanowires without fibronectin using the same procedure. As depicted in Figure 5, the fluorescence observed in Figure 5(b) confirms the bioconjugation of the nanowires with fibronectin. This fluorescence is indicative in contrast to its control showed no fluorescence activity was observed in the case of pure nanowires (Figure 5(c))."

To assess the poly(star)-fibronectin nanowires to sustain mESCs cultures, we investigated the poly(star)-fibronectin nanowire's ability to support mES cells adhesion and growth. Undifferentiated mES cells were cultured for 2 and 3 days on various concentrations of poly(star)-fibronectin nanowires and compared to cell cultures in MEFs, gelatin, and standard polystyrene as a control experiment. The morphology, viability, and proliferation of these cells were investigated. After 3 days of incubation on nanowires, the microscope visualization showed the appearance of a new colony with clear and defined borders, tightly packed and dome-shaped, similar to these colonies obtained with MEFs (Figure 6), which represents a good indication that these cells kept their pluripotency feature. In addition, the obtained results concern the mES cells' proliferation on the nanowires for 48 hr was similar to commercials culture media such as MEFs. This appears to indicate that the polymeric nanowires could be used as an Polymer + D2O 6.5 mg/ml 2.5 mg/ml 1.25 mg/ml 0.75 mg/ml 0.5 mg/ml 0.35 mg/ml 0.25 mg/ml 0.15 mg/ml 0.005 mg/ml  alternative to commercial culture media supporting mES cell growth.",

ALP staining indicated that ALP activity was present in all mES cells cultured on poly(star)-fibronectin nanowires independently of the time of culture (2 or 3 days). In fact, mES cells cultured on poly(star)-fibronectin nanowires resemble the colonies that form when mES cells are cultured on a monolayer of fibroblasts where all cells are ALP positive and colonies are dome-shaped (Figure 7). These results suggest that nanofibers can be used as an alternative to conventional gelatin to support the growth of undifferentiated ES cell cultures.",
                        "Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out to verify the effect of polymeric nanofiber on the cell adhesion markers and the expression of stem cell markers (Figure 8). Cells were characterized for these markers in both conditions. mESCs are reported to be positive for CD105, Oct4, and cKit [17]. Furthermore, cell adhesion markers HSPG2, CD29, and CD138 are directly engaged in cell adhesion. These markers promote cell attachment within the ECM [18]. Proteoglycans are considered essential constituents of the ECM that are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene  expression [19]. Cell marker CD29 was also reported to be expressed in the human MSCs [16]. Where CD138 was demonstrated to promote the proliferation of undifferentiated adipocyte progenitor and inhibit their adipogenic differentiation [20]. Figure 8 shows that all examined markers increased when cells were seeded with polymeric nanofiber at 24 and 48 hr. These data showed an increase in the expression of the stem cell markers (Oct4, cKit, and CD105)  and adhesion markers (proteoglycan, CD29, and syndecan/ CD138), although the decrease in CD138 and CD29 was not significant in cells grown in the polymeric nanofiber. However, a significant reduction in the expression of Oct4, CD138, and CD29 was observed in cells seeded in a monolayer and without polymeric nanofiber. These polymeric nanofibers 3D scaffolds delineate a promising tool for stem cell growth without compromising their stem cell markers. This will improve the adhesion of the cells in vivo when cells are transplanted to target organs. The increase in the cell adhesion markers expression improves the homing and the engraftment capacities of the cells within the targeted organ [21,22]. The number of cells forming aggregates was doubled in number (0.96 \u00d7 10E 6 ) in comparison to the seeding density (0.5 \u00d7 10E 6 ) (Figure 9). The viability of the cells at 48 hr forming aggregates with polymeric nanofiber was 94% compared with the viability of the cells grown without polymeric nanofiber and in monolayer (90%). Furthermore, the vast majority of the cells seeded were retrieved only by a series of washing with a medium instead of trypsinization, since the integrity of these polymeric nanofiber scaffolds can be easily destroyed by simple washing, which limits the denaturation of the surface protein of the cells. No cells remained on the polymeric nanofiber scaffolds when analyzed under the microscope."

                "We grew stem cells on a star-like amphiphilic copolymer of poly(caprolactone)-poly(ethylene oxide) nanofiber-based scaffold, which is a cheap material and easy to prepare. The 3D scaffold allowed the growth of the mESCs and the maintenance of their stem cell characteristics (cell pluripotency). Polymeric nanofibers allowed cell-cell attachment and cell-nanofibers attachment. Growing the cells in 3D scaffold has great potential for regenerative medicine as it mimics the in vivo environment. Another advantage of the cotton scaffold is that the cells are not trypsinized, which will avoid any denaturation of the surface protein of the cells. We also identified two MSCs subpopulations that had different gene expression profiles. This has a big impact on the in vivo application of MSCs for regenerative medicine.   "
