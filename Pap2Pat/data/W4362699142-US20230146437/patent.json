                        "The background description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the present invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.",
                        "Polymeric nanofibers represent an exciting new class of materials that has drawn substantial attention recently, particularly in the field of stem cell and tissue engineering. Such emphasis can be interpreted by the ability of these materials to mimic the arrangement of fibers and fibrils of the extracellular matrix (ECM), making them suitable for a wide range of medical applications in particular stem cell-based tissue engineering and medical textile materials. Increasingly, researchers believe that stem cell technology has the potential to drastically change our approach concerning disease treatment. Unfortunately, stem cells are very sensitive to micro and nano environment changes which make finding a material that mimics the embryonic stem cell niche properly a major challenge. During the past few years, many attempts have been made to build an appropriate artificial scaffold that mimics the stem cell niche and allows a better understanding and improvement of stem cell therapies. For instance, Webster and his colleagues had demonstrated the ability of carbon nanotubes in a polymer matrix to support orthopedic implants and neuronal cell growth and function. For example, when different cell types are cultured on carbon nanofibers reinforced polycarbonate urethane composite, they can result in an increase in neuronal cell numbers and the case of osteoblast cells further bone-forming. Despite the huge success of this system, the fate of carbon nanotubes remains unclear due to safety concerns that these materials still present in terms of toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.",
                        "Self-assembled peptide-based animal sources into nano fibrillar materials have been widely investigated recently for selective application such as differentiation and growth in both vitro and in vivo for a wide range of cells such as neural progenitor cells, primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, mouse osteoblastic cells and human mesenchymal cells.",
                        "For example, a nanofiber network of a self-assembling RAD16-I peptide scaffold developed by Elena Garreta and her colleagues proved to enhance the formation of an mES cell niche and enhance remarkably the frequency of Oct4 positive mES cell colonies compared to the ones cultured on the 2D system suggesting that the 3D-system culture condition enhanced the maintenance of cells with the embryonic phenotype in comparison with 2D scaffold.",
                        "The 3D biomaterials-based scaffold mentioned earlier seems to have great potential; unfortunately, problems related to the formation of such constructs in living organisms have not yet been investigated in-depth. Also, the immunogenicity of such constructs still constitutes a hurdle difficult to overcome.",
                        "Recently 3D scaffolds based on synthetic polymers gained a lot of intention mainly because of their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and flexibility in terms of functionalization with desired biomolecules. Also, polymeric materials can generate a more favorable microenvironment for stem cells development, by providing a complex network of nanofibers, gaps, and pores through which oxygen, hormones, and nutrients are delivered and waste products filtered away.",
                        "Nur-E-Kamal and his team reported the construction of a 3D nanofibrillar surface composed of polyamide nanofibers (Ultra-Web) that can promote the proliferation and self-renewal of mES cells. Moreover, the alkaline phosphatase staining of mES cell colonies revealed that stained colonies were significantly larger for mES cells cultured on Ultra-Web compared to the mES cells cultured on plain coverslips, which provides evidence that dimensionality plays an important role in maintaining stemness in proliferating mES cells.",
                        "Ouyang and coworkers showed the potential of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibrous-based matrix to grow and maintain undifferentiated ES cells. The use of bioconjugate amphiphilic copolymers to generate 3D scaffolds for stem cell growth and differentiation is a fairly new concept when compared with what has been developed by other groups so far, especially in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.",
                        "Therefore, there is a need for a new synthetic 3D structure that overcomes the disadvantages of the existing 2D scaffolds by its ability to resemble more a living body than any other cell culture system, which means that the new synthetic structure can provide a more conducive microenvironment for stem cell culture (or tissue engineering) which eliminates animal by-products and their deleterious effects, normally occurring in traditional culture systems.",
                        "Herein we disclose the development of a new artificial 3D scaffold to support stem cell growth and later their differentiation, by converting biodegradable amphiphilic copolymers (star polymer) into nanowire scaffolds, through a molecular self-assembly process."

Throughout the last step the synthetic amphiphilic copolymer, undergo self-assembly into well-ordered and homogenous soft nanowires often 1-2 \u03bcm long and 30 nm diameter (FIG. 1A), at high concentration these nanowires tend to be predisposed to form 3D scaffold with tiny gaps and pores (FIG. 1B), through which oxygen, hormones, and nutrients can be delivered and waste products to be filtered away to increase in vivo like characteristic of these artificial structures.",
                                "To identify the mechanism by which these nanowires are fashioned, a series of experiments was conducted using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Small Single Neutron Diffraction technique and the data collected from these analyses suggest that the building mechanism of the nanofiber assembly depends on three factors: first the solvent-removal procedure. For water-miscible organic solvents, the copolymer mixture can be dialyzed against water, whereby slow removal of the organic phase triggers micellization that later leads to the formation of the nanowires. By using SASI (small-angle scattering instrument) to determent the small-angle neutron diffraction analysis, we can observe the dependence of the nanowire formation on the solvent-removal procedure, where the cylindrical shapes were observed at a lower percent of the organic solvent compared with water (FIG. 2).",
                                "The impact of the polymer concentration was evaluated by small-angle neutron diffraction (SAND). A series of samples with different copolymer concentrations were prepared. As depicted in FIG. 3, the Neutron Diffraction plots show clear evidence that the transition from spherical micelles to elongated nanofiber structures depends heavily on the concentrations of the polymer in solution; the higher the concentration the faster the nanofiber formation.",
                                "Also, the transition of the copolymer macro-molecules from spherical shapes to elongated nanofibers were probed by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and the images show clearly, that samples with low concentration (0.1-0.20 mg/ml of the copolymer) do not contain any nanowire structures, except for polymeric micelles that appears to be the predominate geometrical form in these samples, however under certain condition such as long time storage, we observed the formation of some nanowire and that is probably due to the reduction of the initial volume of the samples as a result of the evaporation factor, or to a very slow micelles pileup process. However, when the concentration reaches 0.7 mg/ml, we started to observe the formation of cylindrical-shaped micelles. Furthermore, as the concentration increase to 1 mg/ml, inter-micelle interactions prompt a series of fusions between micelles (micelle stacking) that leads to the elongation of the cylindrical shaped micelle into nanofibers (FIG. 4) and nanofibers become the dominant structures in the solution. It is also interesting to note that once the fibers are formed, they are stable in water even if overall polymer concentrations are below the critical fiber concentration which is 0.7 mg/ml. The last factor that we believe has a big impact on the size and the shape of this nanowire is the molecular structure of the amphiphilic copolymer. It is well-known that the self-assembly of the amphiphilic copolymer into nanowires depends mainly on the weight fraction w of the hydrophilic block relative to the total copolymer molecular weight. For poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based diblock in aqueous solution, where wEO\u02dc45-55% leads to the assembly of main nanowires but higher w gives predominantly spherical micelles, and lower w yields vesicles.",
                                "The first step toward the fabrication of this artificial scaffold is the synthesis of bioconjugated nanowires with fibronectin. Fibronectin is a cell-surface and serum-derived glycoprotein and has numerous effects on cells in vitro. At concentrations as low as 1-50 ug/ml, it can promote the adhesion, spreading, migration of fibroblasts and certain other cells, and induce transformed cells to flatten and appear normal. Additionally, fibronectin can influence the differentiation of chondrocytes and myoblasts. The preparation of bioconjugated nanowires with human fibronectin was carried out by conjugating PEG 20000 with the fibronectin to form PEG-fibronectin, followed by mixing PEG-fibronectin with the amphiphilic copolymer start with a ratio of 1 to 3.3. The resulting solution was then placed in a dialysis cassette and dialyzed against deionized water for 4 days at 4\u00b0 C. to yield a fibronectin conjugated nanowire. To confirm the presence of fibronectin on the surface of the nanowires, fibronectin conjugated nanowires were first deposited on the surface of the petri dish, then a solution of amine-reactive fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester) was added to the petri dish and left for 4 hours, to allow the tethering reaction between the dye and the proteins to occur. After several washing, images of Fibronectin conjugated nanowires were taken by fluorescence microscope. A control experiment was performed using block co-polymer nanowires without Fibronectin using the same procedure. As depicted in FIG. 5, the fluorescence observed in FIG. 5B confirms the bioconjugation of the nanowires with fibronectin. This fluorescence is indicative in contrast to its control showed no florescence activity was observed in the case of pure nanowires (FIG. 5C).",

The cells were removed from the poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires by washing the nanowires with a medium. For control experiments, cells were seeded in Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) in 3 wells of a 6-well plate at 50000 cells/well. The total number of cells and the viability of the cells were determined using propidium iodide incubation.",
                                "To assess the poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires to sustain mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) cultures, we investigated the poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowire's ability to support mES cells adhesion and growth. Undifferentiated mES cells were cultured for 2 and 3 days on various concentrations of poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires and compared to cells cultures in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), gelatin, and standard polystyrene as a control experiment. The morphology, viability, and proliferation of these cells were investigated. After 3 days of incubation on nanowires, the microscope visualization showed the appearance of a new colony with clear and defined borders, tightly-packed and dome-shaped similar to these colonies obtained with MEFs (FIG. 6), which represent a good indication that these cells kept their pluripotency feature. In addition, the obtained results concern the mES cells' proliferation on the nanowires for 48 hours were similar to commercials culture media such as MEFs. This appears to indicate that the nanowires could be used as an alternative to commercial culture media supporting mES cell growth.",

In brief, the cells were fixed with citrate/acetone/formaldehyde solution for 4 minutes, and then washed twice with Milli-Q water, then cells are stained with Alkaline Phosphatase Staining solution for 30 min and counterstained with haematoxylin for 4 minutes. The morphology of the colonies and ALP-positive cells were assessed with an inverted light microscope.",
                                "Determination of the long-term impact of poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires on mES cells in terms of pluripotency, an alkaline phosphatase test was carried out using cultured mES cells in 100, 50 \u03bcg/ml of poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires and in control conditions. Alkaline phosphatase staining indicted that alkaline phosphatase activity was present in all mES cells cultured on poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires independently of the time of culture (2 or 3 days). In fact, mES cells cultured on poly(star)-Fibronectin nanowires resemble more the colonies that form when mES cells are cultured on a monolayer of fibroblasts where all cells are alkaline phosphatase positive and colonies are dome-shaped (FIG. 7). These results suggest that nanofibers may be used as an alternative to conventional gelatin to support the growth of undifferentiated ES cell cultures.",

The data obtained showed that the expression levels of Oct4 were in the order of 1.37 and 1.24-fold higher compared to mES cells that have been seeded in MEFs. Furthermore, the expression level of both markers Nanog and SSEA4 were similar to those that have been seeded in MEFs. In conclusion, these results suggest that the polymeric scaffolds not only support stem cells' growth and proliferation but also preserve the mES cell pluripotency.",
