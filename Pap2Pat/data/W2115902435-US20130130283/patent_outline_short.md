## EXAMPLE 1

### Secretion ELISA for Detecting the Effector Protein SptP when Bound to its Cognate Chaperone SicP

- perform ELISA to detect effector protein SptP

## EXAMPLE 2

### Structure ELISA to Detect the Attachment of PrgI to the PgH-Containing Base Element

- detect fully assembled needle complex using Ni-NTA plates and anti-PrgI antibody

## EXAMPLE 3

### Immunodetection of the Translocators SipB and SipC (Western Blot)

- prepare protein samples for Western Blot
- detect translocators SipB and SipC using Western Blot
