                        "The inventors have, through their own research, trials and experiments, devised that, treatment rather than cure is generally the rule for most central nervous system (CNS) disorders, with many options only providing limited or partial relief.",
                        "Despite tremendous efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of CNS disorders at the level of specific membrane receptors, ion channels and signaling pathways, the understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders remains incomplete. Many clinically effective pharmacological treatment strategies for CNS disorders are the result of serendipitous discoveries, and often affect multiple pathways through diverse functional mechanisms making it difficult to deconvolute the molecular mechanisms underlying efficacy.",
                        "For example, topiramate is an anticonvulsant which may be used for focal and general seizures. In another example, migraine may bind to multiple targets, including voltage-gated sodium channels, high-voltage-activated calcium channels, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and other biogenic amine receptors.",
                        "To address the limitations of some CNS pharmacopeia, CNS drug discovery strategies may be limited by their reliance on overly simplified experimental systems, such as isolated biochemical binding tests and in vitro cell-based assays. These systems may not recapitulate the in vivo complexity of the CNS, and may be limited in their ability to predict therapeutic outcomes in the context of human disease biology. Therefore, it may be preferable to establish novel paradigms that can monitor and evaluate the complex brain functionusing multiplexed physiological phenotypes.",
                        "In some examples, small whole organisms, such as C. elegans and zebrafish may be used in drug screening without prior molecular knowledge of the lead chemicals. However, the readouts may be limited to behavioral analysis and morphological phenotyping in some analysis. Furthermore, some of these assays may suffer from the disadvantage that they fail to correlate a drug's therapeutic effects directly to physiological changes in the CNS of the model organism.",
                        "In some preferable embodiments, whole-brain imaging of small animals, such as zebrafish, may provide an effective means of bridging the gap between large-scale cellular activity and behavioral responses. The data can be used to develop drug-screening platforms based purely on complex functional phenotypes. Preferably, the method may be applied to CNS drug discovery beyond the testing of a limited number of agents over a small parameter space of dose and time.",
                        "In one preferable embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for analyzing neuropharmacology of a drug. The method preferably comprises the steps of providing a set of brain activity maps representing changes of a brain activity of a living species under an influence of a plurality of known drugs each consisting of a known chemical structure; clustering the set of brain activity maps to form a plurality of functional classifiers; and classifying a brain activity map associated with a neuroactive compound using the functional classifiers so as to predict a neuropharmacology of the neuroactive compound.",
                        "Preferably, the embodiments of the present invention may be applied as a high-throughput, in vivo drug screening method that combines automated whole-brain activity mapping (BAMing) with computational bioinformatics analysis. Different from some example drug screening methods involving relatively simple models, the preferred method utilizes functional brain physiology phenotypes derived from live, non-anesthetized zebrafish that have been treated with compounds of interest as an input for predicting the therapeutic potential of novel bioactive compounds. Preferably, the method of the present invention may rely on an autonomous robotic system capable of manipulating awake zebrafish larvae for rapid microscopic imaging of their brains at the level of cellular resolution, which may allow for rapid assessment of action potential firing across a whole zebrafish brain; as a result, a large number of whole-brain activity maps (BAMs) can be acquired for a compound library.",
                        "In addition, the brain activity maps may be further analyzed. In a first part of the analysis, it may employ a \u201ctraining set\u201d of 179 clinical drugs to generate information-rich BAMs; the intrinsic coherence among the BAMs for drugs in the training set may be determined by a consensus clustering algorithm. The BAM clusters may be further found to be statistically associated with the drugs' therapeutic categories as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.",
                        "In the second part of the analysis, a strategy employing machine learning may be used to build a functional classifier along with a ranking mechanism to predict the potential novel therapeutic uses of compounds based upon their similarity to clinically used drugs. Using a machine learning process, the successful prediction of compounds may be highlighted with anti-epileptic activity in zebrafish behavioral models from a library of 121 non-clinical compounds. These embodiments may facilitate development of next-generation anti-epileptic agents with novel mechanisms of action.",
                        "With reference to FIG. 1, there is shown an embodiment of a system 100 for analyzing neuropharmacology of a drug, which may be used to perform the abovementioned drug screen method. The system comprises an imaging module 102 arranged to generate images of a brain of the living species 104; a transformation module 106 arranged to generate, based on the images 108 generated by the imaging module 102, a set of brain activity maps 110 representing changes of a brain activity of a living species 104 under an influence of a plurality of known drugs each consisting of a known chemical structure, and a brain activity map 110 associated with a chemical compound; and a processing module 112 arranged to cluster the set of brain activity maps 110 to form a plurality of functional classifiers, and to classify the brain activity map 110 associated with the chemical compound using the functional classifiers so as to predict a neuropharmacology of the chemical compound.",
                        "In this embodiment, the imaging module 102 is arranged to obtain or generate an image 108 of a living species, in particular an image 108 focusing on the brain of such living species 104. For example, living species such as a zebrafish or a zebrafish larva has a brain and some other parts of it covered by optically transparent or translucent skin, therefore image frames 108 illustrating the brain of a zebrafish or its larva may be captured using imager such as an optical imager 114 or camera.",
                        "The transgenic zebrafish line elavl3:GCaMP5G may be maintained in aquaria under standard laboratory conditions (at 28\u00b0 C. under a cycle of 14 h light, 10 h dark). Larvae of 6-8 dpf were used in the HT-BAMing experiments.",
                        "Preferably, the imaging module 102 may process image raw data of the image frames 108 obtained by an imager 114 capturing the living species 104 so as to generate images 108 of the brain of the living species 104. For example, the imaging module 102 may further process the image frames by combining multiple image frames of similar objects being captured or to extract important information from the image raw data in multiple images so as to generate an output image that may be more suitable for further analysis.",
                        "For example, the imaging process may be performed on a fully automated inverted fluorescent microscope (Olympus IX81) equipped with a cooled sCMOS camera (Neo, ANDOR) with a 10\u00d7 (NA, 0.4) objective. Micro-manager 1.4 may be installed to control the microscope. For high-resolution, confocal imaging and Leica SP8 microscope with a resonant scanner may be used.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1, the system 100 further comprises a structure for immobilizing and aligning zebrafish larvae such that the image frames captured by the imager is not blurred due to the movements of the living species. Preferably, a microfluidic device 116 may be used load the living species 104 to a position for image capturing to facilitate the imager 114 to capture the living species 104 and to generate the images 108. In addition, the loaded zebrafish larvae may be applied with a predetermined dose of a chemical compound, such as but not limited to a neuroactive compound, a drug which include a known chemical structure but an unknown biological or pharmaceutical effect to a living species or even an unknown chemical compound in a testing agent.",
                        "Preferably, the microfluidic device 116 may include one or more microfluidic channels 116A each with a dimension that fit a single zebrafish larva of a predetermined size to be loaded therein. The microfluidic device 116 may load the living species using hydrodynamic forces, such that the zebrafish larva is properly aligned/oriented when it reaches the position for image capturing. In addition, as the movement living species is restricted by the flowing rate of the fluid in each of the microfluidic channels, the living species 104 may be immobilized which facilitate capturing a clear image of the living species 104.",
                        "In one example embodiment, a negative mold of a microfluidic chip 116 may be fabricated by high-resolution (30 \u03bcm resolution) Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machining using a plain copper plate. The transparent flow channels were then made by molding from the copper molds using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). After curing for 12 hours, the PDMS structures were released from the molds and then bonded to glass substrate after plasma treatment to form the final microfluidic chip. Alternatively, the microfluidic chip may be fabricated using any fabrication process (such as 3D-printing, imprint, etching technologies etc.) as appreciated by a skilled person.",
                        "Calcium sensitive fluorescent reporters may be used for recording of brain-wide activity in larval zebrafish with single-cell resolution. In this example, changes in the fluorescence of calcium-sensitive fluorophores enable imaging of neuronal activity.

                        "The experimental protocol uses a 96-well plate, with one zebrafish larva (5 days post-fertilization) in 90 \u03bcL of fish water in each well. 10 \u03bcL of a 10\u00d7 solution of compound in 10% DMSO was added to each well to achieve the final concentration shown in the data, and for a final concentration of 1% DMSO. For each concentration, there were 12 fish, and each plate had a group of control larva treated with 1% DMSO (final concentration). Final concentrations of compounds were 500 \u03bcM, 250 \u03bcM, and 100 \u03bcM, except in the case of compounds found to be highly insoluble in water, in which cases the final concentrations were 50 \u03bcM, 25 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM; insoluble compounds tested at these lower concentrations were 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, AR-A014418, P7C3, volinanserin, and yangonin. The larvae were pre-treated with compound for four hours, followed by a two minute dark stimulation to ensure fish were not sedated, followed by a 15 minutes period of observation for deviation from the anticipated normal movement/swimming behavior. A quick change from light to dark induces an increase in activity in zebrafish. After a 15 minute observation period, the larvae were treated with PTZ to a final concentration of 5 mM, and the number of seizures per larva at each concentration quantified for 15 minutes following PTZ treatment. The DanioVision platform (Noldus) was used to perform the animal behavioral recoding and analysis.",
                        "With reference to FIGS. 39C to 39E, Such pharmacological effects could also be observed in the diametrically opposed BAMS from zebrafish treated in the same manner. NNC-711 is thought to principally act through the inhibition of GABA uptake from the synaptic cleft and glia via inhibition of SLC6A1 (solute carrier family 6 member 1; (GAT1)) leading to increased GABA-ergic neurotransmission. These observations in the PTZ zebrafish seizure model are therefore consistent with the anticonvulsant efficacy of NNC-711 in rat models of induced epilepsy.",
                        "Another candidate predicted from the BAMS analysis to have anti-epileptic activity was, GYKI-52466, a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, which was tested and confirmed in the PTZ seizure model. In agreement, GYKI-52466 has been shown previously to have anticonvulsant activity in a kainic-acid induced seizure model in mice 39.",
                        "In addition to the examples of NNC-711 and GYKI-52466, for which retrospective support can be provided for their efficacy from the literature, there were also several non-obvious activities of the predicted hits when tested in the PTZ model. With reference to FIGS. 40A to 40F, for example, volinanserin, a highly selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist that has been tested as a potential antipsychotic, antidepressant, and sleep aid in pre-clinical models, but has not been reported to have anti-seizure activity, reduced seizures in our PTZ seizure model at relatively low does.",
                        "Yangonin is a kavalactone that, in the oncology literature, induces autophagy and inhibits the mTOR pathway, and is a novel CB1 receptor ligand, but with no reported anti-seizure activity. Also, the HDAC6 inhibitor Tubastatin-A reduced seizure count at a final concentration of 500 \u03bcM, the upper end of the concentration range employed in these experiments.",
                        "Overall, the hit compounds employed in the behavior validation studies were selected based on their Pearson correlation coefficient rank within the N03:Anti-epileptic cluster (all had a correlation coefficient of 0.89-0.99) and with an eye towards including a diverse array of putative mechanisms of action, not based on chemical structure or previously published results on their clinical effects. That seven of the 14 compounds tested demonstrated anti-seizure activity in the PTZ model supports the HT-BAMing technology using zebrafish as a physiology-based screening tool for pharmacological discovery.",
                        "When compared with alternative methods of recombinant DNA technology and tissue culture techniques, the embodiments of the present invention is more advantageous. The methods for functional CNS drug screening in larval zebrafish by using HT-BAMing technology may be capable of rapidly assessing changes in brain physiology and activity in response to exposure to a compound at the level of cellular resolution across an entire zebrafish brain.",
                        "In contrast, pharmaceutical discovery for CNS diseases have increasingly relied on simplified targets consisting of recombinant proteins or heterologous cellular models. Screening methods using organism models are limited in their ability to perform large-scale chemical screens based on direct evaluation of organ-specific physiology in a complex animal model. Here, we describe a novel strategy.",
                        "Using HT-BAMing, a collection of BAMs is generated, each of which reflects the changes in brain physiology caused by exposure to a particular compound in a library of bioactive compounds and approved drugs. As part of this screening strategy, a novel computational and machine learning-based process may be implemented to analyze the large-scale BAM dataset, and successful prediction of drug leads for neurological diseases without any prior chemical or molecular knowledge of the compound library may be obtained.",
                        "Double-blind analysis of a \u201ctraining set\u201d containing 179 CNS-active drugs revealed that the phenotypic BAMs naturally form coherent clusters, which were further discovered to have strong association with the clinical usage of those medications, based on their functional WHO ATC classification. This strategy was then validated in a \u201ctest set\u201d of 121 non-clinical compounds without an ATC code. By employing the coherent BAM clusters derived from 179 ATC-coded drug set as a classifier, predictions about the potential therapeutic application of these compounds may be obtained. This association between BAM clusters and ATC categories bridges the enormous gap between high-throughput physiology phenotyping and the potential therapeutic applications of unknown compounds.",
                        "Notably, the BAM-based clustering and prediction are solely based on the modulation of brain activity following exposure to a compound. Therefore, it is not surprising to see a dramatic diversity, both in chemical structures and molecular targets, for compounds within the identified BAM clusters. In particular, for BAM cluster 4, which is strongly associated with the N03:Anti-epileptics ATC category, the signature subgroup for this cluster contains drugs targeting six different major molecular targets. This result suggests that the BAM-based assay according to the embodiments of the present invention provides a drug screening platform with the potential to accommodate the pathophysiologically complex nature of many brain disorders, including epilepsy and other disorders with network imbalance such as those caused by neurodegeneration 45, or autism spectrum disorders such as Rett syndrome 46 and Pitt-Hopkins syndrome 47. Indeed, screening of the test set of 121 compounds correctly clustered potent N03:Anti-epileptic compounds, and, critically, identified several important new lead structures for development of novel anti-epileptics, including volinanserin and yangonin.",
                        "In validating the prediction results using the PTZ seizure model, seven of the 14 compounds tested (50%) decreased seizure frequency without affecting normal behavior. Given that PTZ is a non-competitive GABA antagonist, the fact that the other seven compounds tested were negative in the PTZ model may reflect limited sensitivity of the PTZ model to detect anti-seizure activity mediated through a pathway other than GABA rather than true lack of efficacy as potential anti-seizure agents.",
                        "This exemplifies the power of the HT-BAMing based screening strategy to function independent of any particular pharmacological model, and also highlights the necessity of secondary functional phenotyping methods that are not limited by the knowledge of the pathophysiology of a disorder at the molecular level or to only a limited number of pharmacological models that may have inherent biases in their sensitivity. This is particularly powerful in a disorder such as epilepsy, in which seizures represent the common phenotypic expression of a multifactorial propensity towards seizure activity. Identification of compounds with previously unrecognized anti-epileptic activity may improve understanding of changes at the genetic, epigenetic and cellular levels that create and propagate a chronic tendency towards seizure.",
                        "Although the experiments focused on the analysis of anti-seizure drugs in this proof-of-concept study, the results suggest that the HT-BAMing based screening method can be applied to advance novel pharmacological discovery in other complex brain diseases. Two other BAM clusters from the training set, clusters 3 and 8, had significant overlap with ATC categories N04:Anti-Parkinson drugs and N06:Psychoanaleptics, respectively. The top-ranked prediction from the N04:Anti-Parkinson drugs ATC category, berberine, has been shown in mice to increase dopamine levels, similar to the pro-dopaminergic drugs entacopone and ropinirole.",
                        "Also, the top hit in the N06:Psychoanaleptics category, hydroxytacrine, shares in common the mechanism of acetylcholinesterase inhibition that the Alzheimer's disease drugs galantamine and rivastigmine in the BAM cluster 8 have. It is expected that the use of ATC clinical drugs to construct a larger training set should facilitate the translation of the pharmacological profiles of non-ATC compounds from zebrafish to humans.",
                        "Advantageously, the use of HT-BAMing technology may provide insight into mechanisms of action of poorly understood pharmacological agents and novel compounds, particularly as the number of \u201creference\u201d BAMS obtained from treatment with well-characterized compounds with known mechanisms of action increases. The HT-BAMing based screening strategy presented here can be refined in several ways. For example, the clustering analysis can be refined by taking advantage of more advanced machine learning methods such as recursive cortical network or deep learning algorithms; relevant structure-specific information in the BAMS may be spatially encoded for analysis.",
                        "To further improve the methods, obtaining BAMS at several time-points following one-time or repeated dosing may help identify compounds capable of affecting the course of CNS disorders through longer-term changes in CNS activity.",
                        "In addition, more advanced whole-brain imaging and analysis methods; including registration to brain atlases could help identify specific cell populations affected by compounds. Finally, the use of HT-BAMing in conjunction with zebrafish models of CNS disorders created through the introduction of causal genetic variants using CRISPR/Cas and related genome engineering strategies, has tremendous potential to advance an understanding of systems neuropharmacology and to assist in the discovery of novel disease-modifying pharmacological agents to expand the treatment options available to patients with CNS disorders.",
