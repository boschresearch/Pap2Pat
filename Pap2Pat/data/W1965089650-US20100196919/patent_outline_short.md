# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

- describe rotavirus and its impact on children
- introduce gluten enteropathy and celiac disease
- discuss the relationship between rotavirus and celiac disease
- summarize prior art related to rotavirus and celiac disease
- highlight the need for a new approach to understanding and treating celiac disease

## DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- describe ELISA data analysis

### Dissociation-Enhanced Lanthanide Fluorescent Immunoassay (DELFIA)

- perform DELFIA assay
- detect anti-rotavirus antibodies
- detect anti-celiac peptide antibodies
- analyze data

## Results

### Random Peptide Library

- identify celiac peptide

### Detection of Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies by DELFIA

- detect IgA antibodies against celiac peptide

### Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies Recognize the Rotavirus-Derived Protein VP-7

- compare celiac peptide sequence with microbial sequences

### Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies Recognize Self-Antigens

- compare celiac peptide sequence with human proteins

### Anti-Celiac and Anti-VP-7 Peptide Antibodies Bind Endomysium

- test ability of purified antibodies to bind endomysium

### Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies Induce Monocyte Activation

- evaluate interaction between antibodies and TLR4 on monocytes

### Gene

- study ability of antibodies to engage TLRs and activate NF-ÎºB

### Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies Recognize Desmoglein 1

- determine whether antibodies recognize desmoglein 1

### Anti-Celiac Peptide Antibodies Induce Increased Epithelial Cell Permeability

- evaluate whether antibodies alter intestinal epithelial cell permeability

## Discussion

- summarize study findings
- discuss possible link between rotavirus infection and CD
- conclude that anti-rotavirus antibody response is present in CD patients
