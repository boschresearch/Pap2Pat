                        "Human rotaviruses are the most frequent etiologic agents of gastroenteritis in infants and young children in most parts of the world. Almost all children in the U.S. are likely to be infected with rotavirus before their 5th birthday. In the U.S., rotavirus is responsible for approximately 5 to 10 percent of all episodes of diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years of age. Each year in the U.S., rotavirus is responsible for more than 400,000 doctor visits; more than 200,000 emergency room visits; 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations; and between 20 and 60 deaths. Rotavirus leads to about $1 billion in health care costs and lost productivity per year in the U.S. In developing countries, rotavirus is a major cause of childhood deaths, causing more than a half a million deaths each year in children younger than five years old.",
                        "A monovalent vaccine based on an attenuated human rotavirus strain of P1A[8] G1 specificity, RIX 4414 (RotaRix\u00ae, GSK Biologicals, Belgium), has shown a clinical efficacy of 85% against severe rotavirus disease in recent trials (75,76). In a trial of approximately 60,000 infants, no increase in intussusception was noted among recipients of the vaccine versus placebo. As of June 2006, RotaRix\u00ae is licensed in approximately 30 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and in countries of the European Union and has been introduced into national vaccination programs in Brazil, Panama, and Venezuela. The new vaccine, RotaTeq\u00ae, produced by Merck and Company, Whitehouse Station, N.J., is a live, oral, vaccine for preventing rotavirus disease, and is the only vaccine approved in the U.S. that can help protect against rotavirus. Rotateq (Merck, Inc.) is a pentavalent vaccine containing 5 reassortants representing the common human VP7 types, G1-4, and the most common VP4 type, P[8]. Rotavirus infection has already been associated with pancreatic islet autoimmunity through a mechanism of molecular mimicry between viral peptide sequences, in particular within the VP-7 protein and T cell epitopes in the islet cell autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2. Moreover, immunization of Lewis rats with a peptide derived from the rotavirus protein VP4, showing homology with the highly pathogenic peptide from retinal S-antigen, induced autoimmune uveitis by triggering cross-reactive T cells.",
                        "Gluten enteropathy is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder [1,2] sustained by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten [3], that may affect as many as 1%-3% of the European and North American population [4]. Genetically susceptible individuals develop autoimmune injury to the gut, skin, joints, liver, brain, heart, uterus, and other organs. In addition, celiac patients show an increased prevalence of other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is a small intestine inflammatory disorder with multiple organ involvement, sustained by an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. Anti-transglutaminase antibodies are a typical serological marker in patients with active disease, and may disappear during a gluten-free diet treatment. Involvement of infectious agents and innate immunity has been suggested but never proven. Molecular mimicry is one of the mechanisms that links infection and autoimmunity. Celiac disease (CD) is considered a model for autoimmune disorders because the crucial genetic and environmental factors responsible for its pathogenesis have been identified. It is well known that the interplay of four components induces enteropathy: gluten/gliadin, gluten-specific T cells, the major histocompatibility complex locus HLA-DQ, and the endogenous enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) [1]. tTG can deaminate glutamine to glutamic acid, producing the negatively charged residues necessary for efficient binding to DQ2 and for T cell activation. Genetic, molecular, and functional studies have clarified the powerful Th1-dominated pro-inflammatory response that characterizes the small intestine of patients with active CD. Moreover, patients with active CD have IgA and IgG antibodies directed against tTG [5]. The disease enters complete remission, and anti-tTG antibodies are no longer detectable when gluten is eliminated from the diet (gluten-free diet [GFD]) [6]. In addition to the activation of adaptive immune response, recent evidence suggests that innate immunity might play a role in the initial phases of CD [7]. Indeed, some gluten peptides seem to be able to directly activate the innate immune system [8]. Moreover, infectious agents are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease [9,10]. A key feature of the early stages of CD is the presence of increased intestinal epithelial cell permeability [1,10,11]. One of the mechanisms involved is related to tight-junction derangement [12]. However, alterations involving other types of junctional adhesion may contribute to the increased epithelial permeability. Despite the huge progress in understanding the pathogenesis of CD, facilitated by the knowledge of the genetic background and of the well-defined environmental trigger gluten/gliadin, there are still many unknowns, including the presence of autoaggression in different tissues and the role played by infections and by innate immunity. A recent longitudinal study performed on children carrying celiac disease human leukocyte antigen (HLA) risk alleles provides indication that a high frequency of rotavirus infections may increase the risk of celiac disease autoimmunity in childhood in genetically predisposed individuals [45].",
                        "U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,794 describes a novel antigen for screening patients suspected of having celiac disease. The antigen is prepared by starting with human placenta tissue which is perfused with a herpes and collagenase buffer to obtain a single cell suspension. This suspension is enriched to obtain an enriched protein portion and then separated out to obtain an embryonic celiac antigen (ECA). This ECA is used with serum from patients to effect binding of ECA with IgA in the serum while applying a human IgA antibody to the serum. The results are then read on a spectrophotometer to confirm or negate the presence of celiac disease.",

They show that such antibodies purified from the sera of patients recognize the rotavirus major neutralizing protein VP-7 [13] and self-antigens including tTG [14], human heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) [15], desmoglein 1 [16], and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [17,18]. The anti-peptide antibodies are pathogenetically relevant because of their ability to alter the intestinal barrier integrity and to activate monocytes through a previously unknown mechanism of TLR4 stimulation.",
                        "In addition, the authors observed that in CD patients anti-rotavirus antibody response occurs at high frequency when compared with the response towards the celiac peptide. Therefore, since affinity-purified anti-VP-7 peptide antibodies bind celiac peptide, recognize endomysial structures, activate TLR4, and alter cell permeability, it is suggested that the rotavirus VP-7 epitope may be important in determining an anti-virus immune response, able to cross-react with self-antigens and to have functional consequences on TLR4 engagement and intestinal permeability; it is likely that a molecular mimicry mechanism may be involved in CD pathogenesis."

They identified a peptide recognized by serum immunoglobulins of patients with active disease, but not by those of patients on a gluten-free diet. This peptide shares homology with the rotavirus major neutralizing protein VP-7 and with the auto-antigens tissue transglutaminase, human heat shock protein 60, desmoglein 1, and Toll-like receptor 4. They show that antibodies against the peptide affinity-purified from the sera of patients with active disease recognize the viral product and self-antigens in ELISA and Western blot. These antibodies are able to induce increased epithelial cell permeability evaluated by transepithelial flux of [3H] mannitol in the T84 human intestinal epithelial cell line. Finally, the purified antibodies induce monocyte activation upon binding Toll-like receptor 4, evaluated both by surface expression of activation markers and by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

A second group of 38 CD patients, 12 males and 26 females, aged 1-56 (mean=14 y), with active disease, was also studied. All the patients had serum anti-gliadin and anti-tTG antibodies. Antibodies against IgA, IgM, and IgG were not detected in the sera of all the patients. The duodenal histological damage at diagnosis ranged from grade 3a to 3c, according to Marsh's classification [19]. Patients on GFD were negative for anti-tTG IgA antibodies. The majority of patients suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms; the symptoms present at diagnosis were: gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, abdomen distension, and cramps) in 39 out of 60 patients, and/or extra-intestinal (iron deficiency anemia, dermatitis herpetiformis, spontaneous abortion, weight loss, astenia, growth disturbances, and myopathy) in 25 out of 60 patients. One of the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had thrombocytopenia and no evidence of other autoimmune diseases, and another one suffered from demyelinating CNS disease [20,21]: in this latter patient, multiple sclerosis was excluded on the basis of clinical follow-up, cerebrospinal liquid analysis, and pattern of CNS demyelinization as seen at magnetic resonance imaging. Some patients presented only mild or minimal symptoms, and four patients were asymptomatic (silent CD) with familial history of CD. The patients with CD included in the study showed no evidence of co-existing autoimmune diseases.

After five sequential rounds of biopanning experiments, each preceded by a pre-panning step with pooled Igs obtained from the same 22 patients on GFD to remove bacteria that bound antibodies present in sera of patients with inactive disease, the enriched library was grown and single colonies picked, expanded, and induced with tryptophan to express the fusion peptides. Bacteria were then lysed in sample buffer and tested in Western blot with the pooled Ig fraction from patients on GCD to check for positive clones. DNA was extracted from positive clones and sequenced with an automated sequencing apparatus (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, Conn., United States). A set of 15 peptides, out of the 27 peptides obtained from the last biopanning round, was synthesized, excluding those peptides that shared a high degree of homology with each other (greater than 90%, which corresponds to ten out of 12 amino acid identities or conservative substitutions). The 15 synthetic peptides were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test individual patients' sera as well as control Igs. At the end of the screening procedure, the authors calculated the frequency of antibodies against the individual peptides. In most cases, the reactivity was present in approximately 5% of the patients; therefore, the authors did not consider these sequences anymore. In one case, reactivity against the synthetic peptide was present in approximately 65% of the patients' sera (celiac peptide). Since no other peptide was recognized by serum Igs at such frequency, the authors focused their attention on this particular peptide. The celiac peptide was already sequenced after the second biopanning round and three times after the fifth round, indicating that this reactivity is important since it was still present after five steps of enrichment of the peptide library. Moreover, the fact that the authors could obtain the same sequence from three independently picked clones suggests that this peptide is over-represented among the group of antibody-selected peptide epitopes. Similar behaviour has been observed in other screening procedures performed in our laboratory using the sera of patients with autoimmune diseases [23-26]."

Briefly, the synthetic peptides were used at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml in PBS to coat polystyrene plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Plates were then blocked for 1 h with PBS 3% BSA. Serum samples were diluted in diluting buffer (PBS 1% BSA 0.05% Tween) and incubated on the plates for 3 h at room temperature. Plates were then washed twice with PBS 1% Tween and twice with PBS. Bound antibodies were detected by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgA antiserum (1:1,000 in diluting buffer) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., United States) or with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-human IgG antiserum (1:2,000 in diluting buffer) (Sigma). In some experiments, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (1:2,000 in diluting buffer) (Sigma) was also used. The secondary reagents were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C.; plates were then washed twice with PBS/Tween and twice with PBS. The alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma) diluted in bicarbonate buffer was then added to the wells and the plates read after 30 min or 1 h at a spectrophotometer set at 450 nm. For the competitive assay, the amount of antibody (or serum dilution) that gave 50% of the maximum binding to the antigen on the solid phase was pre-incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. with different amounts of competitors (20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.6 \u03bcg/ml) or buffer (diluting buffer as the one used in the direct ELISA) and then transferred to the antigen-coated plates.

Commercially available kits were used to detect anti-tTG antibodies (recombinant human tTG) (Eurospital), (cut-off threshold value for IgA anti-tTG=7 units/ml), anti-HSP60 antibodies (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) (cut-off threshold OD value for IgA anti-HSP60=0.150), and anti-Salmonella antibodies (Bio Quant, San Diego, Calif., United States) (cut-off threshold OD value for IgG anti-Salmonella typhi=0.120, and for IgA anti-Salmonella=0.150). Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) have been performed using a commercially available kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Windham, N.H., United States). (Cut-off threshold value for ASCA IgG and IgA is 10 U/ml). Anti-rotavirus antibodies were detected using a commercially available viral extract (Virion, Ruschlikon, Switzerland).

Plates were then washed twice with PBS 1% Tween and twice with PBS. Bound antibodies were detected by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal anti-human IgG antibody (Zymed). Positive and negative control sera were purchased from Virion. The OD readings after 30 min of colour development were 0.130 for the negative control serum and 0.650 for the positive control. The mean+3 SD of the control group was an OD of 0.200. Therefore, the authors considered positive only the sera whose OD readings were higher than 0.200. By using this criteria, some sera of patients with CD were considered negative. However, all of these sera had an OD reading greater than the one observed with the negative control serum, between 0.130 and 0.200; therefore, in theory they are all above the levels of the reference negative serum sample and can be considered borderline.",

The OD readings after 30 min of colour development were 0.190 for the negative control serum and 0.550 for the positive control. The mean+3 SD of the control group was an OD of 0.260. Therefore, the authors considered positive only the sera whose OD readings were higher than 0.260."

To monitor the induction of TLR4 signalling in response to ligand stimulation, the authors have used the pNifty reporter plasmid (Invivogen), expressing the secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase gene (SEAP) under the control of a NF-\u03baB-inducible ELAM 1 composite promoter [28]. This composite ELAM 1 promoter is truly NF-\u03baB specific and drives the expression of a reporter gene (SEAP) that is induced in the presence of NF-\u03baB and repressed in the absence of the transcription factor. Engineered 293T cells stably transfected with TLR4 and the co-receptors MD2 and CD14 (Invivogen) were co-transfected with the pNifty plasmids and stable transfectants selected in the presence of phleomycin D1 (Zeocin, Invivogen), as selection agent; 293T cells transfected with TLR9 (Invivogen) and co-transfected with the pNifty plasmid were used as control. Stable transfectants were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin-streptomycin, and Normocin (Invivogen). Cells were grown to 60%-80% confluence in growth medium and then harvested and re-suspended in HEK-Blue Detection medium (Invivogen). This medium is specifically designed for detection of NF-\u03baB activation since it turns blue in the presence of phosphatase activity. The product of the reaction is cytotoxic and results in the death of the cells. 2.5\u00d7104 cells/well (in 200 \u03bcl of medium) were plated in 96-well plates in the presence of the appropriate stimuli (purified endotoxin-free antibody preparation, final concentration 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml). Positive control for TLR4 was LPS (Invivogen), while the stimulatory oligonucleotide with human-specific type B CpGs (oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 sequence 5\u2032-tcg tcg ttt tgt cgt ttt gtc gtt-3\u2032) (Invivogen) was used for TLR9 cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0 C. in 5% CO2 and the blue colour assessed by a spectrophotometer set at 620 nm. All the antibody preparations used in this set of experiments were devoided of LPS contaminants (see previous section).

Using this approach, 20 out of 22 patients' sera had detectable IgA antibodies against the celiac peptide.

Two criteria were used in selecting such microbial proteins: the first is the extent of homology calculated by measuring the length of the homologous stretch and the number of matched amino acids (both identities and conservative substitutions were considered); the second one is based on the nature of the infectious agents. The authors privileged those agents that can be potentially involved in human pathology. Since these infectious agents are all correlated with intestinal damage, they evaluated the prevalence of serum IgG antibodies against such agents in 60 patients with active CD. The authors found that only four patients had antibodies directed against S. cerevisiae (6.6%), and 25 patients had antibodies against S. typhi (41.6%), whereas the large majority of patients (52 out of 60: 86.6%) had antibodies against rotavirus in ELISA, and all of them had antibodies against rotavirus in Western blot (FIG. 1C). The use of DELFIA partially corrected the discrepancies observed between the ELISA and the Western blot in the detection of IgG anti-rotavirus antibodies. By using DELFIA, 58 out of 60 (96.6%) patients' sera showed the presence of IgG anti-rotavirus antibodies, while there was no significant modification in the number of normal controls positive for the presence of IgG anti-rotavirus (18 out of 60 controls).",

The frequency of IgG antibody reactivity against S. typhi and Saccharomyces did not differ among patients and control participants. On the contrary, the frequency of antibodies against rotavirus was significantly higher in patients than in control participants (p<0.0001). Moreover, the authors have tested the patients' sera for their ability to recognize the VP-7 peptide in ELISA; 55 out of 60 patients' sera (91%) had IgG antibodies against the VP-7 peptide, while IgA antibodies against the peptide were present in 45 out of 60 patients' sera (75%).

Affinity-purified antibodies against the celiac peptide induced a time-dependent increase in the transepithelial flux of [3H] mannitol from the basolateral to the apical compartment (FIG. 9A) in T84 human intestinal epithelial cell line [32], used to study the epithelial barrier function. The divergence of flux rate between monolayers treated with antibodies against the celiac peptide and against an irrelevant peptide reached significance after 3 h. This increased permeability was also observed with affinity-purified antibodies directed against the tTG peptide, against desmoglein 1 peptide, against the TLR4 peptide, and against the VP-7 peptide and with pooled Igs from patients with active disease and was similar to the permeability observed after cell incubation with 250 U/ml TNF-alpha. This alteration was present at a much lesser extent with pooled Igs from patients on GFD (FIG. 9B). The effect of affinity-purified anti-celiac peptide antibodies on cell permeability was blocked by pre-incubation of antibodies with human recombinant tTG, celiac peptide, and recombinant desmoglein peptide but not by pre-incubation with the irrelevant peptide (FIG. 9C).",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "In the present study, the authors aimed to clarify some aspects of the pathogenesis of CD, a small intestinal inflammatory disorder characterized by malabsorption, nutrient deficiency, and a vast array of clinical manifestations. Many of the components and events that generate the altered immune response to gluten have been well characterized; however, there are some features relevant to CD pathogenesis that are still unclear, including the systemic autoimmune aggression, the role played by infectious agents, and the involvement of innate immunity in the different phases of the disease [10]. In their attempt to answer these questions, the authors used a random peptide library approach that they have already applied to the study of other autoimmune disease conditions for the identification of disease-relevant self-antigens [23-26]. Using this approach, they identified a pathogenetically relevant autoantigen peptide recognized by the sera of patients with active CD. Such peptide shares homology with the rotavirus-derived protein VP-7; human rotaviruses are the most frequent etiologic agents of gastroenteritis in infants and young children in most parts of the world [33]. Anti-celiac peptide antibodies from patients with CD recognize the viral product, suggesting a possible link between rotavirus infection and CD. Moreover, anti-rotavirus IgG antibodies were detected in all patients with CD and in only 32% of control participants, using Western blot. Rotavirus infection has already been associated with pancreatic islet autoimmunity through a mechanism of molecular mimicry [34-36] between viral peptide sequences, in particular within the VP-7 protein and T cell epitopes in the islet cell autoantigen glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 [37,38]. Moreover, immunization of Lewis rats with a peptide derived from the rotavirus protein VP4, showing homology with the highly pathogenic peptide from retinal S-antigen, induced autoimmune uveitis by triggering cross-reactive T cells [39].",
                        "The report here that purified anti-rotavirus VP-7 peptide antibodies are able to cross-react with the celiac peptide, desmoglein peptide, and TLR4 peptide. Moreover, such antibodies bind endomysial structures and have functional properties similar to the anti-celiac peptide antibody preparation because they activate TLR4 and alter cell permeability. Finally, the authors have also observed that in patients with CD the frequency of IgG and IgA antibodies against the VP-7 peptide is higher than the frequency of antibodies directed against the celiac peptide. Altogether, these data suggest that an anti-rotavirus antibody response is present in celiac patients mainly directed against an epitope within the VP-7 protein. Such response occurs at high frequency when compared with the response towards the celiac peptide, and, therefore, since affinity-purified anti-VP-7 peptide antibodies bind celiac peptide, recognize endomysial structures, activate TLR4, and alter cell permeability, it suggests that the rotavirus VP-7 epitope may be important in determining an anti-virus immune response, able to cross-react with self-antigens and to have functional consequences on TLR4 engagement and intestinal permeability. Therefore, it is likely that a molecular mimicry mechanism may be involved in CD pathogenesis.",
                        "The celiac peptide shares homology with tTG, the major autoantigen target in CD; in particular, the homology comprises the amino acid 476-487, an epitope located in the immunodominant C-terminus area of tTG. Indeed, the deletion of amino acid 476-496 has been reported to completely abolish tTG binding by anti-tTG autoantibodies in CD patients [31,40]. Therefore, with their approach the authors have further restricted the immunodominant epitope to residues 476-487.",
                        "The celiac peptide also shares homology with other self-antigens such as HSP60, MTMR2, and TLR4.",
                        "Heat-shock proteins are highly conserved proteins synthesized when cells are exposed to stressful stimuli, such as infection and inflammation [15], and increased expression of HSPs has been observed in jejunal epithelial cells in patients with CD [41]. Antibodies against the celiac peptide cross-react with HSP60 and may therefore induce epithelial cell cytotoxicity, thus amplifying the damage of the intestinal mucosa with increased intestinal permeability. This is a key feature of the disease and is also induced by the cross-reactive anti-peptide antibodies.",
                        "MTMR2 belongs to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. Defects in MPMR2 are the cause of Charcot-Marie-Toot disease type 4, which is an autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy [42]. A demyelinating nervous system disease can be observed in patients with CD [20,21].",
                        "Finally, TLRs are type I transmembrane proteins involved in innate immunity by recognition of conserved microbial structures. Activation of antigen presenting cells via innate immune receptors such as TLR4 can break self-tolerance and trigger the development of autoimmunity [43,44]. The anti-celiac peptide antibodies bind TLR4 on monocytes and induce both the expression of activation molecules such as CD83 and CD40 and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in a extent similar to LPS. The cytokine secretion is consequent to engagement of TLR4 because the pre-incubation of monocytes with an anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody abolishes such production.",
                        "In conclusion, the present data indicate that in active CD, autoantibodies against an epitope of tTG bind other self-antigens and the rotavirus-derived protein VP-7, suggesting a viral involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease through a mechanism of molecular mimicry. Moreover, such self-reactive antibodies are pathogenetically relevant for their ability to alter the intestinal barrier integrity and to activate monocytes. Monocyte activation follows the binding of TLR4, providing a previously unknown mechanism for TLR4 stimulation. These results provide evidence for a link between innate and adaptive immune response in the pathogenesis of CD."
