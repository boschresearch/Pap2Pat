    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the discovery that a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) plays an active role in mediating inflammatory signaling by way of its specific binding with integrin, especially integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21. More specifically, the invention provides a method for identifying inhibitors of inflammatory signaling by screening for compounds that interrupt the specific binding of sPLA2 and integrin.

                        "Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Catalytic activity of this enzyme that generates arachidonic acid is a major target for development of anti-inflammatory agents. Independent of its catalytic activity, sPLA2-IIA induces pro-inflammatory signals in a receptor-mediated mechanism (e.g., through the M-type receptor). However, the M-type receptor is species-specific: sPLA2-IIA binds to the M-type receptor in rodents and rabbits, but not in human. Thus sPLA2-IIA receptors in human have not been established. The present inventors have demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA bound to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 at a high affinity (KD=2\u00d710\u22127M). They identified amino acid residues in sPLA2-IIA (Arg-74 and Arg-100) that are critical for integrin binding using docking simulation and mutagenesis. The integrin-binding site did not include the catalytic center or the M-type receptor-binding site. sPLA2-IIA also bound to \u03b14\u03b21. The inventors showed that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to \u03b14\u03b21, and bound to a site close to those for VCAM-1 and CS-1 in the \u03b14 subunit. Wt and the catalytically inactive H47Q, mutant of sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation in monocytic cells, but the integrin-binding-defective R74E/R100E mutant did not. This indicates that integrin binding is required, but catalytic activity is not required, for sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signaling. These results indicate that integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21 serve as receptors for sPLA2-IIA and mediate pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA, and that integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction is a novel therapeutic target to suppress pro-inflammatory responses and therefore treat diseases or conditions involving inflammation."

                        "In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for identifying an inhibitor for integrin-sPLA2-IIA binding. The method comprises the steps of: (a) contacting a test compound with sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, or with sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b14\u03b21, under conditions that permit specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21; and (b) determining the level of specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21, wherein a decrease in the level of specific binding compared to a control level of specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21 under the same conditions but in the absence of the test compound indicates the compound as an inhibitor for integrin-sPLA2-IIA binding. In some embodiments, integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21 is present on the surface of a cell. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21 may be endogenously expressed by the cells on their surface or recombinantly expressed on the cell surface. In other embodiments, sPLA2-IIA, or integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, or integrin \u03b14\u03b21 is immobilized on a solid support. In some cases, sPLA2-IIA is labeled with a fluorescent dye, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC).",

In the alternative, the level of specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin can be determined indirectly by measuring the level of proliferation of the cells expressing the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or integrin \u03b14\u03b21 proteins, for example, the U937 human monocytic lymphoma cells or the K562 cells.",

In some embodiments, the inhibitor is an inactivating antibody of sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23. In other embodiments, the inhibitor is an inhibitory nucleic acid comprising a sequence complementary to an sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23 polynucleotide.",

In some embodiments, the inhibitor is an inactivating antibody of sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23. In other embodiments, the inhibitor is an inhibitory nucleic acid comprising a sequence that is complementary to an sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23 polynucleotide.

The response can involve innate immune components and/or adaptive immunity. Inflammation is generally characterized as either chronic or acute. Acute inflammation is characterized by redness, pain, heat, swelling, and/or loss of function due to infiltration of plasma proteins and leukocytes to the affected area. Chronic inflammation is characterized by persistent inflammation, tissue destruction, and attempts at repair. Monocytes, macrophages, plasma B cells, and other lymphocytes are recruited to the affected area, and angiogenesis and fibrosis occur, often leading to scar tissue.",

In some cases, an inhibitor directly binds to either sPLA2-IIA or integrin chain \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, or \u03b21, such that specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 is suppressed or abolished. For instance, an antibody that specifically binds either sPLA2-IIA or integrin chain \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, or \u03b21. Inhibitors also include compounds that are capable of reducing the expression of sPLA2-IIA or integrin chains \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 at the protein level, e.g., transcription-based inhibitors, such as antisense RNAs and siRNAs, RNA aptamers, and the like. Assays for inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA-integrin binding include, e.g., applying putative inhibitor compounds to a cell expressing the appropriate integrin(s) in the presence of sPLA2-IIA under conditions that permit sPLA2-IIA-integrin binding and then determining the effect of the compounds on the binding, as described herein. Assays for the inhibitors also include cell-free systems, where samples comprising sPLA2-IIA and the appropriate integrin(s) treated with a candidate inhibitor are compared to a control sample without the inhibitor to examine the extent of inhibition on the sPLA2-IIA-integrin binding. Control samples (not treated with inhibitors) are assigned a relative binding level of 100%.

                        "Antibodies exist, e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u20322, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CH1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u20322 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u20322 dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see Paul, Fundamental Immunology, Third Ed., Raven Press, NY (1993)). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term \u201cantibody,\u201d as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single chain Fv). These antibody fragments are also useful for methods requiring antigen recognition.",

Generally, the antigen binding regions are derived from a non-human animal, while the constant regions are drawn from human antibodies. The presence of the human constant regions reduces the likelihood that the antibody will be rejected as foreign by a human recipient.",

Generally, a humanized antibody comprises the hypervariable regions, or complementarily determining regions (CDR), of a non-human antibody grafted onto the appropriate framework regions of a human antibody. Antigen binding sites may be wild type or modified by one or more amino acid substitutions, e.g., modified to resemble human immunoglobulin more closely. Both chimeric and humanized antibodies are made using recombinant techniques, which are well-known in the art (see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986)).",
                        "The phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds to an antibody\u201d or \u201cspecifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,\u201d when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in the presence of a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein and do not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions may require an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein, e.g., sPLA2-IIA or integrin chain \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, or \u03b21. For example, antibodies raised against sPLA2-IIA can be selected to obtain antibodies specifically immunoreactive with that protein and not with other proteins, except for polymorphic variants, e.g., proteins at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical to sPLA2-IIA or a fragment thereof, e.g., a domain or unique subsequence. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays, Western blots, or immunohistochemistry are routinely used to select monoclonal antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein. See Harlow and Lane Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Publications, NY (1988) for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity. Typically, a specific or selective reaction will be at least twice the background signal or noise and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background."

                                "The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) family is a group of intracellular and secreted enzymes that hydrolyzes the sn-2 ester bond in the glyceroacyl phospholipids present in lipoproteins and cell membranes to form nonesterified fatty acids and lysophospholipids. These products act as intracellular second messengers or are further metabolized into potent mediators of a broad range of cellular processes, including inflammation, apoptosis, and atherogenesis (Tatulian, S. A., Biophys J, 80(2):789-800 (2001)). The mammalian secretory PLA2 isoforms are comprised of the groups named IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, V, X, and XII (Six, D. A. and Dennis, E. A., Biochim Biophys Acta, 1488(1-2):1-19 (2000); Gelb, M. H. et al., J Biol Chem, 275(51):39823-39826 (2000)). All secretory PLA2 isoforms have in common a Ca2+-dependent catalytic mechanism, a low molecular weight (13 to 16 kDa), several disulfide bridges, and a well-conserved overall 3D structure (Six, D. A. and Dennis, E. A., Biochim Biophys Acta, 1488(1-2):1-19 (2000); Gelb, M. H. et al., Curr Opin Struct Biol, 9(4):428-432 (1999); Valentin, E. and Lambeau, G., Biochim Biophys Acta, 1488(1-2):59-70 (2000)). Secretory PLA2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA) was first isolated and purified from rheumatoid synovial fluid. sPLA2-IIA is an acute-phase reactant and is found in markedly increased plasma concentrations in diseases that involve systemic inflammation such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular disease (up to 1000-fold and >1 \u03bcg/ml). Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 induce synthesis and release of sPLA2-IIA in arterial smooth muscle cells and hepatocytes, which are the major sources of the plasma sPLA2-IIA in these systemic inflammatory conditions (Jaross, W. et al., Eur J Clin Invest, 32(6):383-393 (2002); Niessen, H. W. et al., Cardiovasc Res, 60(1):68-77 (2003)). In addition to being a pro-inflammatory protein, sPLA2-IIA expression is elevated in neoplastic prostatic tissue (Jiang, J. et al., Am J Pathol, 160(2):667-671 (2002)) and dysregulation of sPLA2-IIA may play a role in prostatic carcinogenesis (Dong, Q. et al., Cancer Lett, 240(1):9-16 (2006)), and is a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Sved, P. et al., Cancer Res, 64(19):6934-6940 (2004)).",
                                "Notably some biological effects associated with sPLA2-IIA are independent of its catalytic function (Tada, K. et al., J Immunol, 161(9):5008-5015 (1998)). Catalytically inactive sPLA2-IIA mutants retained the ability to enhance cyclooxygenase-2 expression in connective tissue mast cells (Tada, K. et al., J Immunol, 161(9):5008-5015 (1998)). Also inactivation of sPLA2-IIA by bromophenacyl bromide did not affect sPLA2-IIA's ability to induce secretion of \u03b2-glucuronidase, IL-6, and IL-8 from human eosinophils (Triggiani, M. et al., J Immunol, 170(6):3279-3288 (2003)). It has thus been proposed that sPLA2-IIA's action is mediated through interaction with specific receptors. Indeed the enzyme binds to a high affinity receptor of 180 kDa present on rabbit skeletal muscle (Lambeau, G. et al., J Biol Chem, 269(3):1575-1578 (1994)). This so-called M (muscle) type receptor belongs to the superfamily of C-type lectins and mediates some of the physiological effects of mammalian sPLA2-IIA, and binding of sPLA2-IIA to this receptor induces internalization of sPLA2-IIA (Nicolas, J. P. et al., J Biol Chem, 270(48):28869-28873 (1995)). However, the interaction between sPLA2-IIA and the M-type receptor is species-specific, and human sPLA2-IIA binds to the human or mouse M-type receptor very weakly (Cupillard, L. et al., J Biol Chem, 274(11):7043-7051 (1999)). Thus, sPLA2-IIA receptors in human have not been established. Mammalian sPLA2-IIAs bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans like glypican-1 (Murakami, M. et al., J Biol Chem, 274(42):29927-29936 (1999)) and decorin in apoptotic human T cells (Sartipy, P. et al., Circ Res, 86(6):707-714 (2000)). The binding of sPLA2-IIA to heparan sulfate proteoglycans has been implicated in the release of arachidonic acid from apoptotic T cells (Boilard, E. et al., Faseb J, 17(9):1068-1080 (2003), but it is unclear whether this process plays a role in other situations.",
                                "Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that recognize ECM ligands and cell surface ligands (Hynes, R. O., Cell, 110(6):673-687 (2002)). Integrins are proteins of transmembrane \u03b1\u03b2 heterodimers, and at least 18 \u03b1 and 8 \u03b2 subunits are known (Shimaoka, M. and Springer, T. A., Nat Rev Drug Discov, 2(9):703-716 (2003)). Integrins transduce signals to the cell upon ligand binding (Hynes, R. O., Cell, 110(6):673-687 (2002)). In this study, we investigated whether integrins are involved in the pro-inflammatory functions of sPLA2-IIA. Here we demonstrate that sPLA2-IIA bound to integrins and induced proliferative signals in an integrin-dependent manner. We first showed that sPLA2-IIA specifically bound to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 at a high affinity in several different assays, and localized the integrin-binding site in sPLA2-IIA using docking simulation and mutagenesis. The integrin-binding site did not include the catalytic center or the M-type receptor-binding site. We obtained evidence that sPLA2-IIA also bound to \u03b14\u03b21 and competed with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 for binding to \u03b14\u03b21. Wt and the catalytically inactive mutant of sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation, but an integrin-binding defective mutant did not induce cell proliferation in cells that express \u03b1v\u03b23 and/or \u03b14\u03b21. This indicates that integrin binding is required, but catalytic activity is not required, for sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation. sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation of monocytic U937 cells (\u03b1v\u03b23+/\u03b14\u03b21+) and induced ERK1/2 activation in an integrin-dependent manner. These results suggest that integrins \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21 may serve as receptors for sPLA2-IIA and mediate pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA in human. Thus integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction is a novel therapeutic target in inflammation."

For example, the preferred codon usage of one strain of bacterial cells can be used to derive a polynucleotide that encodes an sPLA2-IIA polypeptide and includes the codons favored by this strain. The frequency of preferred codon usage exhibited by a host cell can be calculated by averaging frequency of preferred codon usage in a large number of genes expressed by the host cell (e.g., calculation service is available from web site of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan). This analysis is preferably limited to genes that are highly expressed by the host cell.",

P14555, P06756, P13612, P05556, and P05106). Polypeptides of known sequences, especially those of relatively short length such as human sPLA2-IIA, may be synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis methods using procedures similar to those described by Merrifield et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149-2156 (1963); Barany and Merrifield, Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, in The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology Gross and Meienhofer (eds.), Academic Press, N.Y., vol. 2, pp. 3-284 (1980); and Stewart et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 2nd ed., Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, Ill. (1984). During synthesis, N-\u03b1-protected amino acids having protected side chains are added stepwise to a growing polypeptide chain linked by its C-terminal and to a solid support, i.e., polystyrene beads. The peptides are synthesized by linking an amino group of an N-\u03b1-deprotected amino acid to an \u03b1-carboxy group of an N-\u03b1-protected amino acid that has been activated by reacting it with a reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The attachment of a free amino group to the activated carboxyl leads to peptide bond formation. The most commonly used N-\u03b1-protecting groups include Boc, which is acid labile, and Fmoc, which is base labile.",

The deprotected \u03b1-amino group is coupled to the activated \u03b1-carboxylate group of the next N-\u03b1-protected amino acid. The process is repeated until the desired peptide is synthesized. The resulting peptides are then cleaved from the insoluble polymer support and the amino acid side chains deprotected. Longer peptides can be derived by condensation of protected peptide fragments. Details of appropriate chemistries, resins, protecting groups, protected amino acids and reagents are well known in the art and so are not discussed in detail herein (See, Atherton et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach, IRL Press (1989), and Bodanszky, Peptide Chemistry, A Practical Textbook, 2nd Ed., Springer-Verlag (1993))."

Suitable bacterial promoters are well known in the art and described, e.g., in Sambrook and Russell, supra, and Ausubel et al., supra. Bacterial expression systems for expressing the sPLA2-IIA or integrin polypeptide are available in, e.g., E. coli, Bacillus sp., Salmonella, and Caulobacter. Kits for such expression systems are commercially available. Eukaryotic expression systems for mammalian cells, yeast, and insect cells are well known in the art and are also commercially available. In one embodiment, the eukaryotic expression vector is an adenoviral vector, an adeno-associated vector, or a retroviral vector.",
                                "The promoter used to direct expression of a heterologous nucleic acid depends on the particular application. The promoter is optionally positioned about the same distance from the heterologous transcription start site as it is from the transcription start site in its natural setting. As is known in the art, however, some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function.",
                                "In addition to the promoter, the expression vector typically includes a transcription unit or expression cassette that contains all the additional elements required for the expression of the desired polypeptide in host cells. A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide and signals required for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, ribosome binding sites, and translation termination. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the desired polypeptide is typically linked to a cleavable signal peptide sequence to promote secretion of the recombinant polypeptide by the transformed cell. Such signal peptides include, among others, the signal peptides from tissue plasminogen activator, insulin, and neuron growth factor, and juvenile hormone esterase of Heliothis virescens. If, however, a recombinant polypeptide (such as an integrin chain \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23) is intended to be expressed on the host cell surface, an appropriate anchoring sequence is used in concert with the coding sequence. Additional elements of the cassette may include enhancers and, if genomic DNA is used as the structural gene, introns with functional splice donor and acceptor sites.",
                                "In addition to a promoter sequence, the expression cassette should also contain a transcription termination region downstream of the structural gene to provide for efficient termination. The termination region may be obtained from the same gene as the promoter sequence or may be obtained from different genes.",

Standard bacterial expression vectors include plasmids such as pBR322 based plasmids, pSKF, pET23D, and fusion expression systems such as GST and LacZ. Epitope tags can also be added to recombinant proteins to provide convenient methods of isolation, e.g., c-myc.",

Other exemplary eukaryotic vectors include pMSG, pAV009/A+, pMTO10/A+, pMAMneo-5, baculovirus pDSVE, and any other vector allowing expression of proteins under the direction of the SV40 early promoter, SV40 later promoter, metallothionein promoter, murine mammary tumor virus promoter, Rous sarcoma virus promoter, polyhedrin promoter, or other promoters shown effective for expression in eukaryotic cells.",

Alternatively, high yield expression systems not involving gene amplification are also suitable, such as a baculovirus vector in insect cells, with a polynucleotide sequence encoding the desired polypeptide under the direction of the polyhedrin promoter or other strong baculovirus promoters.",

The particular antibiotic resistance gene chosen is not critical, any of the many resistance genes known in the art are suitable. The prokaryotic sequences are optionally chosen such that they do not interfere with the replication of the DNA in eukaryotic cells, if necessary. Similar to antibiotic resistance selection markers, metabolic selection markers based on known metabolic pathways may also be used as a means for selecting transformed host cells.",

This signal sequence directs the recombinant protein produced in cytoplasm through the cell membrane into the periplasmic space. The expression vector may further comprise a coding sequence for signal peptidase 1, which is capable of enzymatically cleaving the signal sequence when the recombinant protein is entering the periplasmic space. More detailed description for periplasmic production of a recombinant protein can be found in, e.g., Gray et al., Gene 39: 247-254 (1985), U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,160,089 and 6,436,674.",

                                "When desired polypeptides are produced recombinantly by transformed bacteria in large amounts, typically after promoter induction, although expression can be constitutive, the polypeptides may form insoluble aggregates. There are several protocols that are suitable for purification of protein inclusion bodies. For example, purification of aggregate proteins (hereinafter referred to as inclusion bodies) typically involves the extraction, separation and/or purification of inclusion bodies by disruption of bacterial cells, e.g., by incubation in a buffer of about 100-150 \u03bcg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Nonidet P40, a non-ionic detergent. The cell suspension can be ground using a Polytron grinder (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, N.Y.). Alternatively, the cells can be sonicated on ice. Alternate methods of lysing bacteria are described in Ausubel et al. and Sambrook and Russell, both supra, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.",
                                "The cell suspension is generally centrifuged and the pellet containing the inclusion bodies resuspended in buffer which does not dissolve but washes the inclusion bodies, e.g., 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 2% Triton-X 100, a non-ionic detergent. It may be necessary to repeat the wash step to remove as much cellular debris as possible. The remaining pellet of inclusion bodies may be resuspended in an appropriate buffer (e.g., 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mM NaCl). Other appropriate buffers will be apparent to those of skill in the art.",
                                "Following the washing step, the inclusion bodies are solubilized by the addition of a solvent that is both a strong hydrogen acceptor and a strong hydrogen donor (or a combination of solvents each having one of these properties). The proteins that formed the inclusion bodies may then be renatured by dilution or dialysis with a compatible buffer. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, urea (from about 4 M to about 8 M), formamide (at least about 80%, volume/volume basis), and guanidine hydrochloride (from about 4 M to about 8 M). Some solvents that are capable of solubilizing aggregate-forming proteins, such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 70% formic acid, may be inappropriate for use in this procedure due to the possibility of irreversible denaturation of the proteins, accompanied by a lack of immunogenicity and/or activity. Although guanidine hydrochloride and similar agents are denaturants, this denaturation is not irreversible and renaturation may occur upon removal (by dialysis, for example) or dilution of the denaturant, allowing re-formation of the immunologically and/or biologically active protein of interest. After solubilization, the protein can be separated from other bacterial proteins by standard separation techniques. For further description of purifying recombinant polypeptides from bacterial inclusion body, see, e.g., Patra et al., Protein Expression and Purification 18: 182-190 (2000).",
                                "Alternatively, it is possible to purify recombinant polypeptides from bacterial periplasm. Where the recombinant protein is exported into the periplasm of the bacteria, the periplasmic fraction of the bacteria can be isolated by cold osmotic shock in addition to other methods known to those of skill in the art (see e.g., Ausubel et al., supra). To isolate recombinant proteins from the periplasm, the bacterial cells are centrifuged to form a pellet. The pellet is resuspended in a buffer containing 20% sucrose. To lyse the cells, the bacteria are centrifuged and the pellet is resuspended in ice-cold 5 mM MgSO4 and kept in an ice bath for approximately 10 minutes. The cell suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant decanted and saved. The recombinant proteins present in the supernatant can be separated from the host proteins by standard separation techniques well known to those of skill in the art.",

                                "Often as an initial step, and if the protein mixture is complex, an initial salt fractionation can separate many of the unwanted host cell proteins (or proteins derived from the cell culture media) from the recombinant protein of interest. The preferred salt is ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate precipitates proteins by effectively reducing the amount of water in the protein mixture. Proteins then precipitate on the basis of their solubility. The more hydrophobic a protein is, the more likely it is to precipitate at lower ammonium sulfate concentrations. A typical protocol is to add saturated ammonium sulfate to a protein solution so that the resultant ammonium sulfate concentration is between 20-30%. This will precipitate the most hydrophobic proteins. The precipitate is discarded (unless the protein of interest is hydrophobic) and ammonium sulfate is added to the supernatant to a concentration known to precipitate the protein of interest. The precipitate is then solubilized in buffer and the excess salt removed if necessary, through either dialysis or diafiltration. Other methods that rely on solubility of proteins, such as cold ethanol precipitation, are well known to those of skill in the art and can be used to fractionate complex protein mixtures.",

As a first step, the protein mixture is ultrafiltered through a membrane with a pore size that has a lower molecular weight cut-off than the molecular weight of a protein of interest, e.g., an sPLA2-IIA or integrin monomer polypeptide. The retentate of the ultrafiltration is then ultrafiltered against a membrane with a molecular cut off greater than the molecular weight of the protein of interest. The recombinant protein will pass through the membrane into the filtrate. The filtrate can then be chromatographed as described below.",

Inhibitory nucleic acids can be single-stranded nucleic acids or oligonucleotides that can specifically bind to a complementary nucleic acid sequence. By binding to the appropriate target sequence, an RNA-RNA, a DNA-DNA, or RNA-DNA duplex or triplex is formed. These nucleic acids are often termed \u201cantisense\u201d because they are usually complementary to the sense or coding strand of the gene, although recently approaches for use of \u201csense\u201d nucleic acids have also been developed. The term \u201cinhibitory nucleic acids\u201d as used herein, refers to both \u201csense\u201d and \u201cantisense\u201d nucleic acids.",
                                "In one embodiment, the inhibitory nucleic acid can specifically bind to a target sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, or \u03b21 polynucleotide. Administration of such inhibitory nucleic acids can inhibit undesired inflammatory responses by reducing or eliminating the effects of sPLA2-IIA-intergrin binding and its downstream signals. Nucleotide sequences encoding sPLA2-IIA and integrin chains \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, and \u03b21 are known for several species, including the human cDNA (Genbank Accession Numbers provided above). One can derive a suitable inhibitory nucleic acid from the human sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v, \u03b14, \u03b21, or \u03b23, and their polymorphic variants or interspecies orthologs/homologs.",
                                "By binding to the target nucleic acid, the inhibitory nucleic acid can inhibit the function of the target nucleic acid. This could, for example, be a result of blocking DNA transcription, processing or poly(A) addition to mRNA, DNA replication, translation, or promoting inhibitory mechanisms of the cells, such as promoting RNA degradation. Inhibitory nucleic acid methods therefore encompass a number of different approaches to altering expression of specific genes that operate by different mechanisms. These different types of inhibitory nucleic acid technology are described in Helene and Toulme, Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1049:99-125 (1990).",
                                "Inhibitory nucleic acid therapy approaches can be classified into those that target DNA sequences, those that target RNA sequences (including pre-mRNA and mRNA), those that target proteins (sense strand approaches), and those that cause cleavage or chemical modification of the target nucleic acids.",
                                "Approaches targeting DNA fall into several categories. Nucleic acids can be designed to bind to the major groove of the duplex DNA to form a triple helical or \u201ctriplex\u201d structure. Alternatively, inhibitory nucleic acids are designed to bind to regions of single stranded DNA resulting from the opening of the duplex DNA during replication or transcription. See Helene and Toulme, supra.",
                                "More commonly, inhibitory nucleic acids are designed to bind to mRNA or mRNA precursors. Inhibitory nucleic acids are used to prevent maturation of pre-mRNA. Inhibitory nucleic acids may be designed to interfere with RNA processing, splicing or translation. The inhibitory nucleic acids are often targeted to mRNA. In this approach, the inhibitory nucleic acids are designed to specifically block translation of the encoded protein. Using this approach, the inhibitory nucleic acid can be used to selectively suppress certain cellular functions by inhibition of translation of mRNA encoding critical proteins. For example, an inhibitory antisense nucleic acid complementary to regions of a target mRNA inhibits protein expression (see, e.g., Wickstrom et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:1028-1032 (1988); and Harel-Bellan et al., Exp. Med., 168:2309-2318 (1988)). As described in Helene and Toulme, supra, inhibitory nucleic acids targeting mRNA have been shown to work by several different mechanisms in order to inhibit translation of the encoded protein(s).",
                                "The inhibitory nucleic acids introduced into the cell can also encompass the \u201csense\u201d strand of the gene or mRNA to trap or compete for the enzymes or binding proteins involved in mRNA translation. See Helene and Toulme, supra.",
                                "The inhibitory nucleic acids can also be used to induce chemical inactivation or cleavage of the target genes or mRNA. Chemical inactivation can occur by the induction of crosslinks between the inhibitory nucleic acid and the target nucleic acid within the cell. Alternatively, irreversible photochemical reactions can be induced in the target nucleic acid by means of a photoactive group attached to the inhibitory nucleic acid. Other chemical modifications of the target nucleic acids induced by appropriately derivatized inhibitory nucleic acids may also be used.",
                                "Cleavage, and therefore inactivation, of the target nucleic acids can be affected by attaching to the inhibitory nucleic acid a substituent that can be activated to induce cleavage reactions. The substituent can be one that affects either chemical, photochemical or enzymatic cleavage. For example, one can contact an mRNA:antisense oligonucleotide hybrid with a nuclease which digests mRNA:DNA hybrids. Alternatively cleavage can be induced by the use of ribozymes or catalytic RNA. In this approach, the inhibitory nucleic acids would comprise either naturally occurring RNA (ribozymes) or synthetic nucleic acids with catalytic activity.",
                                "Inhibitory nucleic acids can also include RNA aptamers, which are short, synthetic oligonucleotide sequences that bind to proteins (see, e.g., L1 et al., Nuc. Acids Res., 34:6416-24 (2006)). They are notable for both high affinity and specificity for the targeted molecule, and have the additional advantage of being smaller than antibodies (usually less than 6 kD). RNA aptamers with a desired specificity are generally selected from a combinatorial library, and can be modified to reduce vulnerability to ribonucleases, using methods known in the art.",

                                "Inhibition of signal transduction by sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 binding can be achieved with an inactivating antibody. An inactivating antibody can comprise an antibody or antibody fragment that specifically binds to any one of sPLA2-IIA and integrin chains \u03b1v, \u03b23, \u03b14, and \u03b21 and subsequently abolishes or reduces the binding between sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21. Inactivating antibody fragments include, e.g., Fab fragments, heavy or light chain variable regions, single complementary determining regions (CDRs), or combinations of CRDs with the desired target protein binding activity. An inactivating antibody for sPLA2-IIA-integrin binding can be a naturally occurring antibody derived from any appropriate organism, e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, gibbon, goat, horse, sheep, etc., or an artificial antibody such as a single chain antibody (scFv), a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody.",
                                "The chimeric antibodies of the invention may be monovalent, divalent, or polyvalent immunoglobulins. For example, a monovalent chimeric antibody is a dimer (HL) formed by a chimeric H chain associated through disulfide bridges with a chimeric L chain, as noted above. A divalent chimeric antibody is a tetramer (H2 L2) formed by two HL dimers associated through at least one disulfide bridge. A polyvalent chimeric antibody is based on an aggregation of chains.",

                                "One can identify compounds that are effective inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 binding by screening a variety of compounds and mixtures of compounds for their ability to suppress signal transduction via sPLA2-IIA and integrin via their interference of such binding. The testing can be performed in a cell-based system or in a cell-free system, using either the full length sequences of the sPLA2-IIA and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 polypeptides or a minimal region or subsequence of at least one of sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 polypeptide that is sufficient to support the specific binding between sPLA2-IIA and the integrins.",
                                "One aspect of the present invention is directed to methods for screening compounds that have the activity to inhibit sPLA2-IIA specific binding with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 and therefore to suppress a pro-inflammatory signal. Such compounds can be in the form of a mixture of suitable inhibitors, or each in substantially isolated form. An example of an in vitro binding assay can comprise an sPLA2-IIA polypeptide and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 polypeptides (or fragments thereof responsible for sPLA2-integrin binding), where the level of sPLA2-IIA binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 is determined in the presence or absence of a test compound. Optionally, one of the sPLA2-IIA or integrin polypeptides is immobilized to a solid substrate or support. A detectable label, e.g., a radioactive or fluorescent label, can be provided for sPLA2-IIA or integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21, either directly or indirectly (through a second molecule that specifically recognizes sPLA2-IIA or one of the integrin chains \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21), to facilitate detection of sPLA2-IIA and integrin binding.",
                                "Another typical binding assay comprises cells expressing integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 on their surface and a free sPLA2-IIA polypeptide, where the level of sPLA2-IIA binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 is determined in the presence or absence of a test compound. Suitable cells include any cultured cells such as mammalian, insect, microbial (e.g., bacterial, yeast, fungal), or plant cells. In some embodiments, the cells recombinantly express integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21, whereas in other embodiments, the cells naturally express integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 on the cell surface. In this type of cell-based system, the level of sPLA2-IIA binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 can be determined either directly by measuring the binding or indirectly by measuring the level of downstream effects of the binding such as activation of one or more mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (e.g., extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 or 2, ERK1 or ERK2), typically indicated by their increased phosphorylation at certain tyrosine residues. Increased proliferation rate in cells that express integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 upon exposure to sPLA2-IIA is also an indicator of sPLA2-IIA-integrin mediated signaling.",
                                "In some embodiments, the assays are designed to screen large chemical libraries by automating the assay steps and providing compounds from any convenient source to assays, which are typically run in parallel (e.g., in microtiter formats on microtiter plates in robotic assays).",
                                "In these screening assays it is optional to have positive controls to ensure that the components of the assays are performing properly. For example, a known inhibitor of sPLA2-IIA and integrin binding can be incubated with one sample of the assay, and the resulting change in signal determined according to the methods herein.",
                                "Essentially any chemical compound can be tested as a potential inhibitor of sPLA2-IIA and integrin binding by using methods of the present invention. Most preferred are generally compounds that can be dissolved in aqueous or organic (especially DMSO-based) solutions are used. It will be appreciated that there are many suppliers of chemical compounds, such as Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.), Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), and Fluka Chemika-Biochemica Analytika (Buchs, Switzerland).",

Such \u201ccombinatorial chemical libraries\u201d can be screened in one or more assays, as described herein, to identify those library members (particular chemical species or subclasses) that display a desired characteristic activity. The compounds thus identified can serve as conventional \u201clead compounds\u201d or can be directly used as potential or actual therapeutics.",

For example, inflammation results in leakage of plasma from the blood vessels. Although this leakage can have beneficial effects, it causes pain and when uncontrolled can lead to loss of function and death (such as adult respiratory distress syndrome). Anaphylactic shock, arthritis, and gout are among the conditions that are characterized by uncontrolled or inappropriate inflammation.",

The inflammatory cells then are transported through the endothelial barrier into the surrounding tissue. The result is accumulation of inflammatory cells, in particular neutrophils. Such accumulation is easily detectable by one of skill.",

Thus, an inflammatory response can also be detected by detecting a change in the level of inflammatory cytokines, e.g., in a localized region of irritation or in the serum or plasma of an individual. It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that each of these symptoms can be detected in an individual for the purposes of diagnosis. Further, a subject undergoing therapy for an inflammatory condition can be monitored, for instance, by detecting any changes in severity of the symptoms.

In other instances, the vector is a viral vector system wherein the polynucleotide is incorporated into a viral genome that is capable of transfecting the target cell. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitory nucleic acid can be operably linked to expression and control sequences that can direct transcription of sequence in the desired target host cells.

Viral vector systems useful in the introduction and expression of an inhibitory nucleic acid include, for example, naturally occurring or recombinant viral vector systems. Depending upon the particular application, suitable viral vectors include replication competent, replication deficient, and conditionally replicating viral vectors. For example, viral vectors can be derived from the genome of human or bovine adenoviruses, vaccinia virus, herpes virus, adeno-associated virus, minute virus of mice (MVM), HIV, sindbis virus, and retroviruses (including but not limited to Rous sarcoma virus), and MoMLV. Typically, the inhibitory nucleic acid is inserted into such vectors to allow packaging of the gene construct, typically with accompanying viral DNA, followed by infection of a sensitive host cell and expression of the gene of interest.",

Retroviral vectors are produced by genetically manipulating retroviruses. The viral genome of retroviruses is RNA. Upon infection, this genomic RNA is reverse transcribed into a DNA copy which is integrated into the chromosomal DNA of transduced cells with a high degree of stability and efficiency. The integrated DNA copy is referred to as a provirus and is inherited by daughter cells as is any other gene. The wild type retroviral genome and the proviral DNA have three genes: the gag, the pol and the env genes, which are flanked by two long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. The gag gene encodes the internal structural (nucleocapsid) proteins; the pol gene encodes the RNA directed DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase); and the env gene encodes viral envelope glycoproteins. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 LTRs serve to promote transcription and polyadenylation of virion RNAs. Adjacent to the 5\u2032 LTR are sequences necessary for reverse transcription of the genome (the tRNA primer binding site) and for efficient encapsulation of viral RNA into particles (the Psi site) (see, Mulligan, In: Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression, Inouye (ed), 155-173 (1983); Mann et al., Cell 33:153-159 (1983); Cone and Mulligan, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., 81:6349-6353 (1984)).",
                                "The design of retroviral vectors is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In brief, if the sequences necessary for encapsidation (or packaging of retroviral RNA into infectious virions) are missing from the viral genome, the result is a cis acting defect which prevents encapsidation of genomic RNA. However, the resulting mutant is still capable of directing the synthesis of all virion proteins. Retroviral genomes from which these sequences have been deleted, as well as cell lines containing the mutant genome stably integrated into the chromosome are well known in the art and are used to construct retroviral vectors. Preparation of retroviral vectors and their uses are described in many publications including, e.g., European Patent Application EPA 0 178 220; U.S. Pat.

Biotechniques 6:608-614 (1988); Miller et al. Biotechniques 7:981-990 (1989); Miller (1992) supra; Mulligan (1993), supra; and WO 92/07943.",
                                "The retroviral vector particles are prepared by recombinantly inserting the desired inhibitory nucleic acid sequence into a retrovirus vector and packaging the vector with retroviral capsid proteins by use of a packaging cell line. The resultant retroviral vector particle is incapable of replication in the host cell but is capable of integrating into the host cell genome as a proviral sequence containing the desired nucleotide sequence. As a result, the patient is capable of producing, for example, the inhibitory nucleic acid, thus eliminating or reducing unwanted inflammatory conditions.",
                                "Packaging cell lines that are used to prepare the retroviral vector particles are typically recombinant mammalian tissue culture cell lines that produce the necessary viral structural proteins required for packaging, but which are incapable of producing infectious virions. The defective retroviral vectors that are used, on the other hand, lack these structural genes but encode the remaining proteins necessary for packaging. To prepare a packaging cell line, one can construct an infectious clone of a desired retrovirus in which the packaging site has been deleted. Cells comprising this construct will express all structural viral proteins, but the introduced DNA will be incapable of being packaged. Alternatively, packaging cell lines can be produced by transforming a cell line with one or more expression plasmids encoding the appropriate core and envelope proteins. In these cells, the gag, pol, and env genes can be derived from the same or different retroviruses.",
                                "A number of packaging cell lines suitable for the present invention are also available in the prior art. Examples of these cell lines include Crip, GPE86, PA317 and PG13 (see Miller et al., J. Virol. 65:2220-2224 (1991)).

                                "When used for pharmaceutical purposes, the inhibitory nucleic acid is generally formulated in a suitable buffer, which can be any pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline or sodium phosphate/sodium sulfate, Tris buffer, glycine buffer, sterile water, and other buffers known to the ordinarily skilled artisan such as those described by Good et al. Biochemistry 5:467 (1966).",
                                "The compositions can further include a stabilizer, enhancer or other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or vehicles. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can contain a physiologically acceptable compound that acts, for example, to stabilize the inhibitory nucleic acids of the invention and any associated vector. A physiologically acceptable compound can include, for example, carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose or dextrans, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid or glutathione, chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins or other stabilizers or excipients. Other physiologically acceptable compounds include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents or preservatives, which are particularly useful for preventing the growth or action of microorganisms. Various preservatives are well known and include, for example, phenol and ascorbic acid. Examples of carriers, stabilizers or adjuvants can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 17th ed. (1985).",

In some embodiments of the invention, the nucleic acid is formulated in mucosal, topical, and/or buccal formulations, particularly mucoadhesive gel and topical gel formulations. Exemplary permeation enhancing compositions, polymer matrices, and mucoadhesive gel preparations for transdermal delivery are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,346,701.",
                                "The formulations containing the inhibitory nucleic acid are typically administered to a cell. The cell can be provided as part of a tissue or as an isolated cell, such as in tissue culture. The cell can be provided in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro.",
                                "The formulations can be introduced into the tissue of interest in vivo or ex vivo by a variety of methods. In some embodiments of the invention, the inhibitory nucleic acid is introduced into cells by such methods as microinjection, calcium phosphate precipitation, liposome fusion, ultrasound, electroporation, or biolistics. In further embodiments, the nucleic acid is taken up directly by the tissue of interest.",
                                "In some embodiments of the invention, the inhibitory nucleic acid is administered ex vivo to cells or tissues explanted from a patient, then returned to the patient.

                                "Effective dosage of the formulations will vary depending on many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, and other medicines administered. Thus, treatment dosages will need to be titrated to optimize safety and efficacy. In determining the effective amount of the vector to be administered, the physician should evaluate the particular nucleic acid used, the disease state being diagnosed; the age, weight, and overall condition of the patient, circulating plasma levels, vector toxicities, progression of the disease, and the production of anti-vector antibodies. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular vector. To practice the present invention, doses ranging from about 10 ng-1 g, 100 ng-100 mg, 1 \u03bcg-10 mg, or 30-300 \u03bcg inhibitory nucleic acid per patient are typical. Doses generally range between about 0.01 and about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably between about 0.1 and about 5 mg/kg of body weight or about 108-1010 or 1012 viral particles per injection. In general, the dose equivalent of a naked nucleic acid from a vector is from about 1 \u03bcg-100 \u03bcg for a typical 70 kg patient, and doses of vectors which include a retroviral particle are calculated to yield an equivalent amount of an inhibitory nucleic acid."

                                "sPLA2-IIA binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 To test if sPLA2-IIA binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, we used CHO cells and the proteoglycans-deficient variants of CHO cells (pgs745) (Esko, J. D. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82(10):3197-3201 (1985)) expressing recombinant \u03b1v\u03b23 (designated \u03b23-CHO and \u03b23-745 cells, respectively). We found that f3-CHO and 03-745 cells adhered to immobilized sPLA2-IIA at a much higher level than mock-transfected CHO or 745 cells (FIG. 1a). Consistent with the previous report that proteoglycans support binding of positively charged sPLA2-IIA to the cell surface (Fuentes, L. et al., FEBS Lett, 531(1):7-11 (2002)), mock-CHO cells adhered to sPLA2-IIA better than mock-transfected 745 cells. These results suggest that the difference in adhesion between 03-CHO and CHO or between 03-745 and 745 reflects the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-mediated adhesion to sPLA2-IIA. We found that mAb against human integrin (33 subunit (mAb 7E3) effectively reduced the adhesion of (3-CHO cells to the background level (from 67% to about 30%) (FIG. 1b), indicating that the adhesion is specific to \u03b1v\u03b23. These results indicate that \u03b1v\u03b23 mediated cell adhesion to sPLA2-IIA, that proteoglycans partly supported cell adhesion to sPLA2-IIA.",
                                "Next we tested if soluble sPLA2-IIA binds to cell surface \u03b1v\u03b23. We found that FITC-sPLA2-IIA bound at much higher levels to cells expressing high-level \u03b1v\u03b23 (\u03b23-high) than to cells expressing little \u03b1v\u03b23 (\u03b23-low) (FIG. 1c), indicating the significant contribution of \u03b1v\u03b23 in sPLA2-IIA binding. The low-level binding of sPLA2-IIA to \u03b1v\u03b23-low cells probably represents contribution of proteoglycans and other receptors.",
                                "We next demonstrated that recombinant soluble \u03b1v\u03b23 bound to immobilized sPLA2-IIA in ELISA-type assays (FIG. 1d). Soluble \u03b1v\u03b23 bound to the disintegrin domain of ADAM15, a known \u03b1v\u03b23 ligand (Zhang, X. P. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273(13):7345-7350 (1998)) (as a positive control), but did not significantly bound to BSA (as a negative control). These results indicate that \u03b1v\u03b23 directly binds to sPLA2-IIA. We showed that soluble sPLA2-IIA bound to immobilized \u03b1v\u03b23 in surface plasmon resonance studies at a high affinity (see below).",
                                "Docking simulation of interaction between integrin and sPLA2-IIA To determine how sPLA2-IIA binds to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, we performed docking simulation by using AutoDock3. AutoDock is a set of docking tools widely used for predicting the conformation of small ligands bound to receptors (Goodsell, D. S. and Olson, A. J., Proteins, 8(3):195-202 (1990); Morris, G. M. et al., J. Comp. Chem., 19:1639-1662 (1998); Morris, G. M. et al., J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des., 10(4):293-304 (1996)), and the methods has been used to predict protein-protein complex poses (Saphire, E. O. et al., Science, 293(5532):1155-1159 (2001)). We performed 50 dockings, each one starting with a random initial position and orientation of sPLA2-IIA (PDB code 1DCY1 and 1AYP) with respect to the headpiece of \u03b1v\u03b23 (PDB code 1L5G). The results were clustered together by positional RMSD (0.5 Angstrom) into families of similar poses. Twenty-four of the 50 docking poses clustered well with the lowest docking energy (cluster 1), with a docking energy \u221226.1 Kcal/mol with 1DCY1 and \u221225.5 Kcal/mol with 1AYP. These results predict that the docking pose of cluster 1 represents the most probable stable sPLA2-IIA pose upon binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 (FIG. 2a). While the poses obtained by using two structures are slightly different, the integrin-binding sites are overlapping. This model predicts that the integrin-binding interface of sPLA2-IIA with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 does not include the catalytic center of sPLA2-IIA (e.g., His-47). The interface on the \u03b1v\u03b23 side contains several \u03b1v (green) or 03 (red) residues that have been shown to be critical for ligand binding by mutagenesis and crystallographic studies (Takagi, J. et al., J. Biochem, 121:914-921 (1997); Humphries, J. D. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275(27):20337-20345 (2000); Xiong, J. P. et al., Science, 296(5565):151-155 (2002)). Thus the predicted docking model is consistent with the previous biochemical studies of integrin-ligand interaction.",
                                "Mutagenesis study of the predicted integrin-binding interface of sPLA2-IIA To test if the docking model is correct, we introduced several mutations within the predicted interface of sPLA2-IIA with integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. Positively charged amino acids at the predicted interface common to 1AYP and 1DCY (Arg-42, Arg-53, Arg-74, and Arg-100) were mutated to Glu (charge reversal mutagenesis) (FIG. 2b). We found that the R74E and R100E mutations in sPLA2-IIA reduced the binding to soluble \u03b1v\u03b23, while the R42E and R53E mutations had little or no effect on integrin binding (FIGS. 3a and 3b). We generated the catalytically inactive mutant of sPLA2-IIA by mutating His-47 to Gln (the H47Q mutation) as a control. The H47Q mutation did not affect the binding to soluble \u03b1v\u03b23. These results are consistent with the prediction by docking simulation. The combined R74E/R100E mutation effectively reduced the binding of sPLA2-IIA to soluble \u03b1v\u03b23 (FIG. 3b) and was used for further analysis of the role of integrins in sPLA2-IIA signaling.",
                                "We determined binding kinetics of wt and mutant sPLA2-IIA to soluble \u03b1v\u03b23 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (FIG. 3c). Wt and H47Q sPLA2-IIA showed high affinity to \u03b1v\u03b23 (KD=2.11\u00d710\u22127M and 4.47\u00d710\u22128M, respectively) and the R74E/R100E mutant showed much lower affinity (KD=1.08\u00d710\u22126M). This is consistent with the results obtained by ELISA-type binding assays.",
                                "PLA2 activity was measured to confirm that the integrin-binding-defective mutation did not affect catalytic activity (FIG. 3d). The data suggest that the H47Q mutation reduced PLA2 activity (while its integrin binding was not affected). In contrast, the R74E/R100E mutation did not affect PLA2 activity (while its integrin binding was suppressed).",
                                "sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferation of monocytic cells in an integrin-dependent manner\u2014It has been reported that sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferation of LNCap prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (Sved, P. et al., Cancer Res, 64(19):6934-6940 (2004)) and induced resistance to apoptosis in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (Zhang, Y. et al., J Biol Chem, 274(39):27726-27733 (1999)). We tested if the integrin-binding-defective or catalytically inactive mutations affect sPLA2-IIA's ability to induce proliferative signals. Notably, we found that wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q-induced robust proliferation of monocytic U937 cells, but R74E/R100E did not (FIG. 4a). These results suggest that integrin binding to sPLA2-IIA plays a critical role in sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation, but catalytic activity is not important in this process. Consistent with this observation, wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q-induced, but R74E/R100E did not induce, ERK1/2 activation in U937 cells (FIG. 4b). While it has been reported that U937 cells express \u03b1v\u03b23 (Nath, D. et al. J. Cell Sci., 112(Pt 4):579-587 (1999)), 7E3 did not block adhesion of U937 cells to sPLA2-IIA (not shown), suggesting that other receptors are involved in the binding of sPLA2 to U937 cells. We hypothesized that integrin \u03b14\u03b21, a major integrin in U937 cells (Hemler, M. E. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262(24):11478-11485 (1987)), may be involved in sPLA2-IIA signaling in U937 cells. We tested this hypothesis using K562 cells that express recombinant \u03b14\u03b21 (\u03b14-K562 cells). \u03b14-K562 cell adhered to immobilized wt sPLA2-IIA better than mock-transfected K562 cells (FIG. 5a), suggesting that \u03b14\u03b21 interacts with sPLA2-IIA. However, a small molecular weight \u03b14\u03b21 ligand (LLP2A) (Peng, L. et al., Nat Chem Biol, 2(7):381-389 (2006)) or anti-\u03b14\u03b21 mAb SG73 or P4C2 (Irie, A. et al., Embo J, 14(22):5550-5556 (1995)) did not block \u03b14\u03b21 binding to sPLA2-IIA in transfected K562 cells (data not shown). To confirm that sPLA2-IIA binds to \u03b14\u03b21, we tested if sPLA2-IIA competes with known \u03b14\u03b21-specific ligand such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 for binding to \u03b14\u03b21. We found that sPLA2-IIA suppressed adhesion of U937 cells to VCAM-1 (FIG. 5b), whereas sPLA2-IIA did not suppress cell adhesion to \u03b14\u03b21-specific ligand fibronectin domains 8-11. K562 cells have endogenous \u03b15\u03b21. This suggests that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to \u03b14\u03b21.",
                                "To confirm that sPLA2-IIA binds to \u03b14\u03b21, we mapped the sPLA2-IIA binding site in the \u03b14 subunit. We previously identified several amino acid residues in the \u03b14 subunit (e.g., Tyr-187 and Gly-190) that are critical for VCAM-1 and CS-1 binding (Irie, A. et al., Embo J, 14(22):5550-5556 (1995)) and for binding of LLP2A (Peng, L. et al., Nat Chem Biol, 2(7):381-389 (2006)) to \u03b14 by introducing point mutations in the \u03b14 subunit. We tested if these \u03b14 mutations affect sPLA2-IIA binding to \u03b14\u03b21. We found that mutating Tyr-189 and Gly-190 of \u03b14 to Ala blocked binding to sPLA2-IIA (FIG. 5c), suggesting that sPLA2-IIA binding site in \u03b14 is close to or overlaps with the VCMA-1 or CS-1 binding sites. We obtained similar results using K562 cells that express the \u03b14 mutants (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the observation that sPLA2-IIA and VCAM-1 competed for binding to \u03b14\u03b21.",
                                "To test if \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21 individually mediate sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation, we used K562 cells that over-expressed \u03b1v\u03b23 or \u03b14\u03b21 (\u03b1v\u03b23- and \u03b14-K562 cells, respectively). sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferation of \u03b14-K562 cells, and to a less extent, of \u03b1v\u03b23-K562 cells. sPLA2-IIA did not induce proliferation of mock-transfected K562 cells (FIG. 6a). Consistent with the results with U937 cells, H47Q-induced proliferation of \u03b1v\u03b23- and \u03b14-K562 cells, but R74E/R100E did not induce proliferation of \u03b1v\u03b23- or \u03b14-K562 (FIG. 6b). These results suggest that sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferation of K562 cells required the binding of sPLA2-IIA to \u03b14\u03b21 or \u03b1v\u03b23, but did not require catalytic activity of sPLA2-IIA."

                                "The present study establishes for the first time that human sPLA2-IIA specifically bound to integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 at a high affinity (KD 2\u00d710\u22127M). Using docking simulation and mutagenesis, we developed an integrin-binding-defective mutation of sPLA2-IIA (the R74E/R100E mutation) that effectively reduced \u03b1v\u03b23 binding without affecting catalytic activity. In contrast the H47Q mutation destroyed catalytic activity, but did not reduce \u03b1v\u03b23 binding. SPR studies showed that the R74E/R100E mutation markedly reduced the binding affinity to \u03b1v\u03b23, but the H47Q mutant did not. These results are consistent with the prediction from the simulation, and that the integrin-binding site is distinct from the catalytic center or the M-type receptor-binding site, in which Gly-30 and Asp-49 of sPLA2-IIA are involved (Lambeau, G. et al., J Biol Chem, 270(10):5534-5540 (1995)).",
                                "Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is a ubiquitous receptor that is expressed on a variety of cell types (Eliceiri, B. P. and Cheresh, D. A., J. Clin. Invest., 103(9):1227-1230 (1999); Byzova, T. V. et al., Thromb. Haemost., 80(5):726-73444,45 (1998)). Consistent with its expression profile in vivo, \u03b1v\u03b23 plays a key role in the initiation or progression of several human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and ocular diseases, and cardiovascular diseases (Eliceiri, B. P. and Cheresh, D. A., J. Clin. Invest., 103(9):1227-1230 (1999); Byzova, T. V. et al., Thromb. Haemost., 80(5):726-73444,45 (1998)). Endothelial cells are primary targets in angiogenesis in chronic inflammation and cancer, and activated endothelial cells express high levels of \u03b1v\u03b23 (Eliceiri, B. P. and Cheresh, D. A., J. Clin. Invest., 103(9):1227-1230 (1999)). Macrophages represent a major mononuclear cell population in inflammation (Antonov, A. S. et al., Am. J. Pathol., 165(1):247-258 (2004)), and macrophages express high-level \u03b1v\u03b23. Its expression is modulated by several cytokines (e.g., interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) and growth factors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor). \u03b1v\u03b23 is consistently detected on the macrophages in early and advanced human atherosclerotic lesions, and its expression is up regulated by atherogenic stimuli (oxidized low-density lipoprotein, macrophage colony-stimulating factor) in vitro (Antonov, A. S. et al., Am. J. Pathol., 165(1):247-258 (2004)). These reports suggest that sPLA2-IIA and \u03b1v\u03b23 co-exist in the inflammatory lesion and directly connect the pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA and \u03b1v\u03b23, the newly identified receptor of sPLA2-IIA.",
                                "We also presented evidence that \u03b14\u03b21 that is widely expressed in immune-competent cells (Hynes, R. O. et al., Cell, 110(6):673-687 (2002)) mediated sPLA2-IIA binding using K562 cells that express recombinant \u03b14. Although mAbs or small-molecular weight antagonist tested against \u03b14 did not significantly inhibit \u03b14\u03b21-sPLA2-IIA interaction, we showed that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to \u03b14\u03b21. Also, amino acid residues of \u03b14 (Tyr-189 and Gly-190) that are critical, or close to the critical, residues for VCAM-1 and CS-1 binding were also critical for sPLA2-IIA binding. These findings suggest that sPLA2-IIA binds to \u03b14\u03b21 in a ligand-binding site common to those for other known \u03b14\u03b21 ligands.",
                                "We showed that wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q-induced proliferation and ERK1/2 activation in U937 cells (\u03b1v\u03b23+, \u03b14\u03b21+), while R74E/R100E did not, suggesting that sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signals of monocytic cells in an integrin-dependent manner. These observations directly connect the pro-inflammatory functions of sPLA2-IIA and integrins. Although relative contribution of \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 in sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signals in U937 cells is unclear, we showed \u03b14\u03b21 and to a less extent \u03b1v\u03b23 can individually mediate cell proliferation using \u03b1v\u03b23- and \u03b14-K562 cells. In both cases sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation in an integrin-dependent and catalytic activity-independent manner. Because K562 cells have very low proteoglycans (Zhang, H. C. et al., J. Med. Chem., 44(7):1021-1024 (2001)), the effect of sPLA2 binding to proteoglycans is not important in this cell type.",
                                "It has been reported that specific inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA catalytic activity S-5920/LY315920Na and S-3013/LY333013 failed to demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis (Bradley, J. D. et al., J Rheumatol, 32(3):417-423 (2005)) and asthma (Bowton, D. L. et al., J Asthma, 42(1):65-71 (2005)). The present results suggest that sPLA2-IIA-integrin interaction is a novel potential therapeutic target in inflammation. It would be important to develop antagonists that effectively block this interaction to fully evaluate the significance of this interaction in future studies.",
