    "abstract": "Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Catalytic activity of this enzyme that generates arachidonic acid is a major target for development of anti-inflammatory agents. Independent of its catalytic activity, sPLA2-IIA induces pro-inflammatory signals in a receptor-mediated mechanism (e.g. through the M-type receptor). However, the M-type receptor is species-specific: sPLA2-IIA binds to the M-type receptor in rodents and rabbits, but not in human. Thus sPLA2-IIA receptors in human have not been established. Here we demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA bound to integrin alphavbeta3 at a high affinity (K(D)=2 x 10(-7) M). We identified amino acid residues in sPLA2-IIA (Arg-74 and Arg-100) that are critical for integrin binding using docking simulation and mutagenesis. The integrin-binding site did not include the catalytic center or the M-type receptor-binding site. sPLA2-IIA also bound to alpha4beta1. We showed that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to alpha4beta1, and bound to a site close to those for VCAM-1 and CS-1 in the alpha4 subunit. Wild type and the catalytically inactive H47Q mutant of sPLA2-IIA induced cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation in monocytic cells, but the integrin binding-defective R74E/R100E mutant did not. This indicates that integrin binding is required, but catalytic activity is not required, for sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signaling. These results suggest that integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha4beta1 may serve as receptors for sPLA2-IIA and mediate pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA, and that integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction is a novel therapeutic target.",

We generated sPLA2-IIA as an insoluble protein in bacteria BL21 and purified it by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denatured conditions and refolded following the protocols (\"Isolation of proteins from inclusion bodies\" available from the Bjo \u00a8rkman laboratory). Briefly, purified proteins in 8 M urea were diluted into refolding buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mM L-Arg, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5 mM reduced glutathione, and protease inhibitors) and kept for 8 h at 4 \u00b0C, and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. The refolded sPLA2-IIA was more than 90% homogeneous in SDS-PAGE. We performed site-directed mutagenesis by QuikChange method (27). The presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To remove endotoxin, we washed the Ni-NTA resin with 1% Triton X-114 before eluting the bound protein.

            "paragraphs": [
                "sPLA2-IIA Bound to Integrin \u2423v\u24243-We have previously shown that CHO cells that express human \u24243 (designated \u24243-CHO) bound to several different ligands to \u2423v\u24243 (e.g. angiostatin (31), cardiotoxin (32), ADAM15 (22), and FGF1 ( 28)) while mock-transfected CHO cells did not. Thus \u24243-CHO cells are useful tools to demonstrate the specific binding of ligands to \u2423v\u24243. Because sPLA2-IIA binds to proteoglycans we also used the proteoglycan-deficient variants of CHO cells (pgs745) (26) that express human \u24243 (designated as \u24243-745 cells). These cells express \u2423v\u24243 as a hamster \u2423v/human \u24243 hybrid. We found that \u24243-CHO and \u24243-745 cells adhered to immobilized sPLA2-IIA at a much higher level than mocktransfected CHO or 745 cells (Fig. 1a). Consistent with the previous report that proteoglycans support binding of positively charged sPLA2-IIA to the cell surface (34), mock-CHO cells adhered to sPLA2-IIA better than mock-transfected 745 cells. These results suggest that the difference in adhesion between \u24243-CHO and CHO or between \u24243-745 and 745 reflects the integrin \u2423v\u24243-mediated adhesion to sPLA2-IIA. We found that mAb against human integrin \u24243 subunit (mAb 7E3) effectively reduced the adhesion of \u24243-CHO cells to the background level (from 67 to about 30%) (Fig. 1b), indicating that the adhesion is specific to \u2423v\u24243. These results indicate that \u2423v\u24243 mediated cell adhesion to sPLA2-IIA, that proteoglycans partly supported cell adhesion to sPLA2-IIA, consistent with a previous report (18).",
                "Next we tested if soluble sPLA2-IIA binds to cell surface \u2423v\u24243. We first stained the \u24243-CHO cells for \u24243 expression with anti-\u24243 mAb and PE-labeled secondary antibody, and then incubated with FITC-labeled sPLA2-IIA. We selected cell populations that express high or low levels of \u24243 and tested if sPLA2-IIA binding is related to the levels of \u24243 expression in flow cytometry. We found that FITC-sPLA2-IIA bound at much higher levels to cells expressing high level \u2423v\u24243 (\u24243-high) than to cells expressing little \u2423v\u24243 (\u24243-low) (Fig. 1c), indicating the significant contribution of \u2423v\u24243 in sPLA2-IIA binding. The low level binding of sPLA2-IIA to \u2423v\u24243-low cells probably represents contribution of proteoglycans and other receptors.",
                "We next demonstrated that recombinant soluble \u2423v\u24243 bound to immobilized sPLA2-IIA in ELISA-type assays (Fig. 1d). Soluble \u2423v\u24243 bound to the disintegrin domain of ADAM15, a known \u2423v\u24243 ligand (22) (as a positive control), but did not significantly bound to BSA (as a negative control). These results indicate that \u2423v\u24243 directly binds to sPLA2-IIA. We showed that soluble sPLA2-IIA bound to immobilized \u2423v\u24243 in surface plasmon resonance studies at a high affinity (see below)."

                        "To determine how sPLA2-IIA binds to integrin \u2423v\u24243, we performed docking simulation by using AutoDock 3. AutoDock is a set of docking tools widely used for predicting the conformation of small ligands bound to receptors (35)(36)(37), and the methods has been used to predict protein-protein complex poses (38). We performed 50 dockings, each one starting with a random initial position and orientation of sPLA2-IIA (PDB code 1DCY1 and 1AYP) with respect to the headpiece of \u2423v\u24243 (PDB code 1L5G). The results were clustered together by positional RMSD (0.5 \u00c5) into families of similar poses. 24 of the (cluster 1) with a docking energy \u03ea26.1 kcal/mol with 1DCY1 and \u03ea25.5 kcal/mol with 1AYP. These results predict that the docking pose of cluster 1 represents the most probable stable sPLA2-IIA pose upon binding to \u2423v\u24243 (Fig. 2a)). While the poses obtained by using two structures are slightly different, the integrin-binding sites are overlapping. This model predicts that the \u2423v\u24243 integrin-binding interface of sPLA2-IIA with integrin \u2423v\u24243 does not include the catalytic center of sPLA2-IIA (e.g. His-47). The interface on the \u2423v\u24243 side contains several \u2423v (green) or \u24243 (red) residues that have been shown to be critical for ligand binding by mutagenesis and crystallographic studies (39 -41). Thus the predicted docking model is consistent with the previous biochemical studies of integrin-ligand interaction.",
                        "Mutagenesis Study of the Predicted Integrin-binding Interface of sPLA2-IIA-To test if the docking model is correct, we introduced several mutations within the predicted interface of sPLA2-IIA with integrin \u2423v\u24243. Positively charged amino acids at the predicted interface common to 1AYP and 1DCY (Arg-42, Arg-53, Arg-74, and Arg-100) were mutated to Glu (charge reversal mutagenesis) (Fig. 2b). We found that the R74E and R100E mutations in sPLA2-IIA reduced the binding to soluble \u2423v\u24243, while the R42E and R53E mutations had little or no effect on integrin binding (Fig. 3, a andb). We generated the catalytically inactive mutant of sPLA2-IIA by mutating His-47 to Gln (the H47Q mutation) as a control. The H47Q mutation did not affect the binding to soluble \u2423v\u24243. These results are consistent with the prediction by docking simulation. The combined R74E/R100E mutation effectively reduced the binding of sPLA2-IIA to soluble \u2423v\u24243 (Fig. 3b), and was used for further analysis of the role of integrins in sPLA2-IIA signaling.",
                        "We determined binding kinetics of Wt and mutant sPLA2-IIA to \u2423v\u24243 using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 3c). We immobilized recombinant soluble \u2423v\u24243 to a sensor chip and monitored the association and dissociation of Wt or mutant sPLA2-IIA in solution with \u2423v\u24243 on the chip. Wt and H47Q sPLA2-IIA showed high affinity to \u2423v\u24243 (K D \u03ed 2.11 \u03eb 10 \u03ea7 M and 4.47 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 M, respectively) and the R74E/R100E mutant showed much lower affinity (K D \u03ed 1.08 \u03eb 10 \u03ea6 M). This is consistent with the results obtained by ELISA-type binding assays.",
                        "PLA2 activity was measured to confirm that the integrin binding-defective mutation did not affect catalytic activity (Fig. 3d). The data suggest that the H47Q mutation reduced PLA2 activity (while its integrin binding was not affected). In contrast, the R74E/R100E mutation did not affect PLA2 activity (while its integrin binding was suppressed).",
                        "sPLA2-IIA Induced Proliferation of Monocytic Cells in an Integrin-dependent Manner-It has been reported that sPLA2-IIA induced proliferation of LNCap prostate cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (10) and induced resistance to apoptosis in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (42). To address if sPLA2-IIA-integrin interaction is involved in monocyte proliferation, we tested if the integrin binding-defective or catalytically inactive mutations affects sPLA2-IIA's ability to induce proliferative signals in monocytic U937 cells. Notably, we found that Wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q induced robust proliferation of U937 cells, but R74E/R100E did not (Fig. 4a). These results suggest that integrin binding to sPLA2-IIA plays a critical role in sPLA2-IIA-induced cell proliferation, but catalytic activity is not important in this process. Consistent with this observation, Wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q induced, but R74E/R100E did not induce, ERK1/2 activation in U937 cells (Fig. 4b). While it has been reported that U937 cells express \u2423v\u24243 (43), 7E3 did not block adhesion of U937 cells to sPLA2-IIA (not shown), suggesting that other receptors are involved in the binding of sPLA2 to U937 cells. We hypothesized that integrin \u24234\u24241, a major integrin in U937 cells (44), may be involved in sPLA2-IIA signaling in U937 cells.",

We obtained similar results with CHO cells that express human \u24234 (\u24234-CHO) and mock-trans- Based on the docking model we introduced mutations in the integrin-binding interface of sPLA2-IIA.

To confirm that sPLA2-IIA binds to \u24234\u24241, we tested if sPLA2-IIA competes with known \u24234\u24241-specific ligand such as VCAM-1 for binding to \u24234\u24241. We found that sPLA2-IIA suppressed \u24234\u24241-mediated adhesion of U937 cells to VCAM-1 (Fig. 5b), whereas sPLA2-IIA did not suppress cell adhesion to \u24235\u24241-specific ligand fibronectin domains 8 -11. This suggests that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to \u24234\u24241.",
                        "To confirm that sPLA2-IIA binds to \u24234\u24241, we mapped the sPLA2-IIA-binding site in the \u24234 subunit. We previously identified several amino acid residues in the \u24234 subunit (e.g. Tyr-187 and Gly-190) that are critical for VCAM-1 and CS-1 binding (23) and for binding of LLP2A (45) to \u24234 by introducing point mutations in the \u24234 subunit. These amino acid residues are located within the ligand-binding site of integrins (46). We tested if these \u24234 mutations affect sPLA2-IIA binding to \u24234\u24241 using CHO cells that express Wt or mutant human \u24234 as a human \u24234/hamster \u24241 hybrid (23). We found that mutating Tyr-189 and Gly-190 of \u24234 to Ala blocked binding to sPLA2-IIA (Fig. 5c), suggesting that sPLA2-IIA-binding site in \u24234 is close to or overlaps with the VCMA-1 or CS-1 binding sites. We obtained similar results using K562 cells that express the \u24234 mutants (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the observation that sPLA2-IIA and VCAM-1 competed for binding to \u24234\u24241.",

Consistent with the results with U937 cells, H47Q induced proliferation of \u2423v\u24243and \u24234-K562 cells, but R74E/R100E did not induce proliferation of \u2423v\u24243or \u24234-K562 (Fig. 6b). These results suggest that sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferation of K562 cells required the binding of sPLA2-IIA to \u24234\u24241 or \u2423v\u24243, but did not require catalytic activity of sPLA2-IIA."

                "The present study establishes for the first time that human sPLA2-IIA specifically bound to integrin \u2423v\u24243 at a high affinity (K D 2 \u03eb 10 \u03ea7 M). Using docking simulation and mutagenesis, we developed an integrin binding-defective mutation of sPLA2-IIA (the R74E/R100E mutation) that effectively reduced \u2423v\u24243 binding without affecting catalytic activity. In contrast the H47Q mutation destroyed catalytic activity, but not reduce \u2423v\u24243 binding. SPR studies showed that the R74E/R100E mutation markedly reduced the binding affinity \u2423v\u24243, but the H47Q mutant did not. These results are consistent with the prediction from the simulation, and that the integrin-binding site is distinct from the catalytic center or the M-type receptorbinding site, in which Gly-30 and Asp-49 of sPLA2-IIA are involved (47).",
                "Integrin \u2423v\u24243 is a ubiquitous receptor that is expressed on a variety of cell types (48,49). Consistent with its expression profile in vivo, \u2423v\u24243 plays a key role in the initiation or progression of several human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and ocular diseases, and cardiovascular diseases (48,49). Endothelial cells are primary targets in angiogenesis in chronic inflammation and cancer, and activated endothelial cells express high levels of \u2423v\u24243 (48). Macrophages represent a major mononuclear cell population in inflammation (50), and macrophages express high level \u2423v\u24243. Its expression is modulated by several cytokines (e.g. interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423) and growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor). \u2423v\u24243 is consistently detected on the macrophages in early and advanced human atherosclerotic lesions, and its expression is up-regulated by atherogenic stimuli (oxidized low-density lipoprotein, macrophage colonystimulating factor) in vitro (50). These reports suggest that sPLA2-IIA and \u2423v\u24243 co-exist in the inflammatory lesion and directly connect the pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA and \u2423v\u24243, the newly identified receptor of sPLA2-IIA.",
                "We also presented evidence that \u24234\u24241 that is widely expressed in immunocompetent cells (19) mediated sPLA2-IIA binding using cells that express recombinant \u24234. Although mAbs or small molecular weight ligand tested against \u24234 did not significantly inhibit \u24234\u24241-sPLA2-IIA interaction, we showed that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to \u24234\u24241. Also, amino acid residues within the ligand-binding site of \u24234 (Tyr-189 and Gly-190) that are critical, or close to the critical residues, for VCAM-1 and CS-1 binding were also critical for sPLA2-IIA binding. These findings suggest that sPLA2- b, sPLA2-IIA blocked adhesion of U937 cells to VCAM-1, but did not block adhesion of U937 cells to the cell-binding domain of fibronectin. Wells of 96-well microtiter plate were coated with VCAM-1 and FN-GST, and incubated with U937 cells (1 \u03eb 10 4 cells/plate) in the presence of the increasing concentrations of sPLA2-IIA for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Adherent cells were quantified using endogenous phosphatase after gently rinsing the well to remove unbound cells. Data are shown as means \u03ee S.E. of triplicate experiments. *, p \u03ed 0.0101 and **, p \u03fd 0.0001 by Student's t test. c, amino acid sequence in the \u24234 subunit that is critical for VCAM-1 and CS-1 binding is also critical for sPLA2-IIA binding. CHO cells that clonally express Wt or mutant \u24234 (23) were used for adhesion assays. Data are shown as means \u03ee S.E. of triplicate experiments. Similar results were obtained using K562 cells expressing \u24234 mutants (not shown). IIA binds to \u24234\u24241 in a ligand-binding site common to those for other known \u24234\u24241 ligands.",
                "We showed that Wt sPLA2-IIA and H47Q induced proliferation and ERK1/2 activation in U937 cells (\u2423v\u24243\u03e9, \u24234\u24241\u03e9), while R74E/R100E did not, suggesting that sPLA2-IIA induced proliferative signals of monocytic cells in an integrin-dependent manner. These observations directly connect the pro-inflammatory functions of sPLA2-IIA and integrins. Although relative contribution of \u24234\u24241 and \u2423v\u24243 in sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signals in U937 cells is unclear, we showed \u24234\u24241 and to a less extent \u2423v\u24243 can individually mediate cell proliferation using \u2423v\u24243and \u24234-K562 cells. In both cases sPLA2-IIA induced cell proliferation in an integrin-dependent and catalytic activity-independent manner. Because K562 cells have very low proteoglycans (51), the effect of sPLA2 binding to proteoglycans is not important in this cell type.",
                "It has been reported that specific inhibitors of sPLA2-IIA catalytic activity S-5920/LY315920Na and S-3013/LY333013 failed to demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis (52) and asthma (53). The present results suggest that sPLA2-IIA-integrin interaction is a novel potential therapeutic target in inflammation. Because anti-\u24234 antibodies we used and a small molecular weight \u24234 ligand (LLP2A) did not block \u24234\u24241-sPLA2-IIA interaction, we were not able to directly test the role of sPLA2-IIA-\u24234\u24241 interaction in inflammation. Function-blocking antibodies against integrins (including \u24234\u24241) have been selected for inhibition of cell adhesion to large extracellular matrix proteins (such as fibronectin). Because sPLA2-IIA is a small ligand, it is not surprising that the antibodies against \u24234 did not effectively block sPLA2-IIA-\u24234\u24241 binding. We will need to develop anti-\u24234 antibodies that block sPLA2-IIA binding to \u24234\u24241. Also, the docking simulation predicted that sPLA2-IIA will not occupy the RGD motif-binding site between the \u2423 and \u2424 subunits. This will probably explain why LLP2A did not block \u24234\u24241-sPLA2-IIA interaction, because LLP2A is expected to bind to the LDV motif (which is related to RGD) binding site in \u24234\u24241 (45). It would be important to develop antagonists that effectively block this interaction to fully evaluate the significance of this interaction in future studies."
