    "abstract": "Microfluidics sensor devices having an array of smart polymer hydrogel features for resistive channel analyte sensing via hydrogel swelling and de-swelling, and methods of manufacturing and using the same. Inexpensive, rapid-responsive, point-of-use sensors for monitoring disease biomarkers or environmental contaminants in, for example, drinking water, employ smart polymer hydrogels as recognition elements that can be tailored to detect almost any target analyte. Fabrication involves mask-templated UV photopolymerization to produce an array of smart hydrogel pillars, with large surface area-to-volume ratios, inside sub-millimeter channels located on microfluidics devices. The pillars swell or shrink upon contact aqueous solutions containing a target analyte, thereby changing the resistance of the microfluidic channel to ionic current flow when a bias voltage is applied to the system. Hence resistance measurements can be used to transduce hydrogel swelling changes into electrical signals. A portable potentiostat can be included to make the system suitable for point of use.",

For potential use in chemical sensing, microfluidic devices offer advantages such as potentially being low cost and requiring only small sample volumes. The sensor response time is shown to decrease with an increase in surface area-to-volume ratio.",
                        "A continuous chemical sensor can be obtained by combining a smart polymer hydrogel with a means for transducing hydrogel swelling changes into electrical signals. However, while smart polymer hydrogels can be chemically tailored to selectively respond to many different analytes, swelling response time is often a limiting factor for their use in sensing applications. Given that the rate of analyte mass transfer is often the rate-determining step in hydrogel response, the present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the proposition that shorter response times can be achieved by fabricating smart hydrogels with large surface area-to-volume ratios.

Sensors that employ smart polymer hydrogels as recognition elements can be tailored to detect almost any target analyte, but often suffer from long response times. We describe here fabrication processes that can be used to manufacture low-cost, disposable, and/or point-of-use hydrogel-based microfluidics sensors with short response times. Rapid hydrogel response rate is achieved by fabricating arrays of smart hydrogels that have large surface area-to-volume ratios.",

Arrays of (regularly spaced) smart hydrogel pillars can be fabricated inside sub-millimeter channels located within microfluidics devices. Specifically, in some embodiments of the present disclosure (e.g., a fabrication process), mask-templated UV photopolymerization is used to produce arrays of smart hydrogel pillars inside sub-millimeter channels located upon microfluidics devices. When these pillars contact aqueous solutions containing a target analyte, they swell or shrink, thereby changing the resistance of the microfluidic channel to ionic current flow when a small bias voltage is applied to the system. Hence resistance measurements can be used to transduce hydrogel swelling changes into electrical signals. With the addition of (portable) potentiostat that can optionally be operated using a smartphone or a laptop, the system can be suitable for point of use.",
                        "For potential use in chemical sensing, microfluidic devices offer advantages such as potentially being low cost and requiring only small sample volumes. Thus, the present disclosure also relates to a novel method for chemical sensing transduction using smart hydrogel pillars that we call resistive channel sensing. In this sensing approach, smart hydrogel pillars are fabricated within the main channel of a microfluidics device. The microchannel is then filled with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution to create a conductive path for ionic current. A DC voltage of 0.3 volts is applied to the system through the contact pads (the electrodes), which are in contact with the solution, and the induced ionic current through the channel is measured as an electrical current between the electrodes.",

This sensing approach is similar to the well-studied technique known as microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS), in which changes in the electrical resistance of a microfluidic channel are used to determine the size of nanoparticles that pass through a microfluidic channel. The present disclosure illustrates the feasibility of fabricating microscopic smart hydrogel pillar arrays with large surface area-to-volume ratios inside microfluidics channels, and secondly to determine the reduction in the response time that can be attributed to the use of smart hydrogel pillars within microfluidic sensors.",

Several fabrication approaches are known in the art and compatible with the embodiments disclosed and described herein. FIG. 1 shows an illustration of the assembly of an illustrative microfluidics device 100 (for in situ patterning of hydrogel pillars, as described below). The device can be manufactured using a low-cost fabrication approach with the microfluidic channels fabricated employing a computer controlled cutting plotter. The illustrative channel designs were created in AutoCAD (Version: 2016; Autodesk, Inc., San Rafael, Calif., USA) and then cut with the knife plotter (Model CAMEO 2; Silhouette America Inc.).",

The bottom layer 102 in the device 100 comprises a base substrate 104, comprising a (rectangular) piece of polycarbonate (40 mm\u00d775 mm\u00d70.25 mm), with electrodes 106 (e.g., silver paste electrodes) (MG Chemical) (1 mm\u00d725 mm\u00d70.04 mm) stenciled or affixed onto a surface 108 of the base 104. As illustrated in FIG. 1, one electrode 106 or multiple electrodes 106 can be placed at opposing ends of the base 104. The center layer 120 comprises an adhesive film layer 122 (e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC) adhesive film) that binds the (bottom and top) layers together and that also serves as the microchannel structure. Specifically, an elongated channel 124 is cut through the adhesive film 122 to form the microchannel 126 in the assembled device 100. The channel 124 and/or microchannel 126 formed thereby can have a length of about 35 mm, a width of about 1.6 mm, and a depth of about 50 \u03bcm, in some embodiments. Accordingly, the center (adhesive) layer 120 can have a thickness of about 50 \u03bcm, in some embodiments.

The top layer 130 can be slightly smaller (width wise) than the bottom layer 102 to allow access to the electrodes 106 for measurement. To make interfacing with the device 100 and/or microfluidic channel 126 simple or convenient, connectors 136 (e.g., for attaching microfluidic tubing) can be attached to the top layer 130 over the holes 134.

Illustratively, the apertures 144 in the phot mask 142 can be round (to form cylindrical pillars) or any other suitable geometric shape (e.g., oval, square, rectangular, etc.). Photo patterning of the array is accomplished by directing collimated UV light 148 from a UV light source 146 through the apertures 144 to polymerize the hydrogel 140 to form (solid or semi-solid) smart hydrogel pillars 150 within the microchannel 126. Illustratively, the hydrogels were polymerized via cros slinking copolymerization using lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo., USA) as the UV free radical initiator. The light source was a collimated Hg-vapor lamp. While patterning the hydrogel pillars, a dark field chromium photomask with the desired pillars pattern was placed over the channel. Collimated UV light from a mask aligner (Model 206; OAI, San Jose, Calif., USA), with an initial intensity of 13.5 W/cm2 and an exposure time of 5.5 s, was used to polymerize the hydrogel to form pillars within the microchannel.",

Illustratively, 1.5 s of UV exposure was flood applied to the channel itself, after the photo patterning was complete and the mask was removed. In certain embodiments, this additional step may be necessary to polymerize a thin hydrogel layer across the channel to enhance adhesion of the hydrogel pillars to the channel and to keep their regular arrangement. Specifically, the shortened, flood exposure process created a thin film of hydrogel between the pillars to keep the pillars from being flushed away during the introduction of analyte solutions. Without being bound to any theory, when this step was not carried out in the current embodiment, it was observed that the patterned pillars did not keep their locations in the channel and were easily flushed out by the surrounding flow. Moreover, the UV light intensity decreased slightly from its initial value at the beginning of the experiments. Hence, the exposure time was adjusted accordingly to ensure a constant exposure dose for all experiments.",

The microchannel 126a can be raised above the upper surface of the base substrate 104a or recessed into (or below) the upper surface of the base substrate 104a. Illustratively, the microchannel 126a (or microchannel network) can comprise one or more (thin) layer(s) (e.g. sheet(s)) of polycarbonate or other material (e.g., polymer). The conductive PLA (black) 106a contacts, interacts, and/or intersects the microchannel 126a (so as to be in electrical communication therewith).

The fraction of the total (filled) microfluidic channel area or volume occupied by the pillars 150 is about 19.6% in this embodiment. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the array can have pillar diameters of about 300 \u03bcm, with a spacing of about 600 \u03bcm between the centers of the pillars 150. However, the pillar height (about 50 \u03bcm) and the fraction of the total area occupied by the pillars (about 19.6%) were about the same in both arrays. In another embodiment, the array can have pillar diameters of about 50 \u03bcm, with a spacing of about 100 \u03bcm between the centers of the pillars 150 (see FIG. 8)."

The hydrogel studied here contains both cationic tertiary amines and anionic phenylboronic acid moieties. However, the net hydrogel charge is negative at pH 7.5, and even more so at pH 10.5. Hence the hydrogel is expected to swell when pH is increased from 7.5 to 10.5. To make this swelling change easier to visualize with an optical microscope, we performed the pH response tests in a low ionic strength saline buffer ( 1/12\u00d7 PBS). This reduction in salinity increases the pillar diameter at all pH values, because addition of salt causes hydrogels to shrink by reducing the environmental chemical potential value of water.",

For the sensor containing the smaller pillars, the syringe pump connection was switched between the reservoirs every 30 min, and the flow rate was 10 \u03bcL/min. For the sensor containing the larger pillars, the syringe pump connection was switched between the reservoirs every 60 min, and the flow rate was 10 \u03bcL/min. This flow rate implies a Reynolds number value of less than 100; the ionic current flow attributable to this flow is of order 1 to 10 nA. The ionic current within the main microfluidics channel was measured using a potentiostat (EmStat3+) using a three-electrode configuration. One electrode pad was connected to the working electrode, while the other two were connected to the counter electrode and reference electrode pads. The system operates by applying a small bias voltage and reading the resulting current across the microchannel. The Chronoamperometry method was used to record the current data in PSTrace (Verson 5.2, Houten, The Netherlands), using a software application that came with EmStat3+. A 60 s pretreatment with a constant DV voltage of 0.3 volts was applied before data collection; the same DC voltage was then applied again throughout the entire experimental period.",

The syringe pump was used to flow 1/12\u00d7 PBS into the sensor at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcL/min, with the pH value of this solution increasing with time from 7.5 to 10.5 while photos were being taken.

This micrograph confirms that we succeeded in fabricating a regularly spaced array of smart hydrogel pillars within a microfluidics channel. FIG. 4B compares the pillar diameter at pH 7.5 and 10.5. The pillars swell with increase in pH for the reasons discussed above.",
                                "When the hydrogel pillar diameter changes due to the change in pH, this changes the value of the ionic current detected by the potentiostat at fixed voltage, as shown by the results presented in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 shows the time-dependent behavior of the sensor current at fixed voltage as the pH value is periodically changed between 7.5 and 10.5. Results are presented for two different devices, one containing pillars of diameter 100 \u03bcm, and the other containing pillars of diameter 300 \u03bcm. At the higher pH value, the hydrogel pillars swell, which corresponds to a minimum in the value of the ionic current. The conductance of the microfluidics channel is proportional to both the ion concentration and the cross-sectional area available for current flow. Since the ionic strength was fixed at 25 mOsm/kg in these experiments, the oscillation in current observed in FIG. 5 can be attributed to changes in the microfluidics channel cross-sectional area that occur as the pillars shrink and swell.

The value of Ibase was substantially different for the two devices studied (FIG. 5), probably due to variabilities in the device fabrication procedure. Nonetheless, the signal response, calculated as a percentage (Equation (1)) was quite similar for the two devices studied (FIG. 5). Most of the pH response of the smart hydrogel studied here occurs near pH 7, because this is close to the pKa value of PBA inside polyampholytic hydrogels. Hence it the sensor studied here could probably not be used for pH values below 6 or above 8, unless we changed the hydrogel. Based upon the results in FIG. 5, we estimate that the sensor has a resolution of about 0.1 pH units near pH 7.",

For both devices, the swelling response time is shorter than the shrinking response time. This may potentially be explained as follows. When a hydrogel starts to shrink, it shrinks first at its outer surface, thereby creating an outer surface film with a low permeability that retards further diffusion of the target analyte into the hydrogel. This, of course, tends to increase the hydrogel response time. For both swelling and shrinking response, FIG. 6 shows that the response time is smaller for sensors containing smaller diameter hydrogel pillars. Comparison is made in FIG. 6 between T90 response times obtained using pillars of diameter 100 \u03bcm and diameter 300 with surface area-to-volume ratios of 40 mm\u22121 and 13.3 mm\u22121, respectively. The increase in the surface area-to-volume ratio by a factor of 3 is observed to reduce the sensor response time, averaged over both swelling and shrinking response times, by a factor of approximately 7.",

                                "FIG. 9 illustrates a schematic of a microfluidics sensing device with smart hydrogel for detecting analytes of interest in solution using resistive channel sensing (RCS). The device is designed to detect changes in the size of the hydrogel as it shrinks (or swells) when exposed to an analyte (e.g., when the analyte binds to the hydrogel). The measurement is made using current measurements through the (center of the) microchannel. Using a four-electrode configuration, for example, a small (input) voltage or voltage bias is applied (across the microchannel), and (output) current is measured. In the illustrative starting state depicted in FIG. 9(A), the hydrogel is fully swelled (e.g., in an aqueous fluid (or solution) comprising PBS), which reduces the current that can pass through the central microchannel. As fluid (e.g., PBS solution or water) with the analyte is delivered through the side channels to the central channel, the hydrogel with begin to shrink, allowing more current to travel through the microchannel (B). A plot of current vs. time is shown for each state (C) and (D). This method allows for a simple electronic output for monitoring hydrogel sensing. FIG. 8 shows an example of a hydrogel shrinking from a stimuli (e.g., analyte exposure). The hydrogel can also or alternatively be engineered to expand in response to stimuli (e.g., exposure to certain analyte(s)), which would give currents or current changes in the opposite direction of those shown."

                        "In the present disclosure, we disclose a method for fabricating low-cost and fast-responding smart hydrogel sensors inside microfluidics channels using soft material microfabrication techniques. The use of photolithographic methods to create micrometer scaled smart hydrogel structures inside a microchannel reduces the cost for this device and removes the need for cleanroom facilities. While in this work we did use a UV source from a mask aligner, without being bound to any theory, a low-cost collimated UV source (such as from Omnicure Inc.) would have been sufficient to create the micropillar arrays.",
                        "In the present disclosure, arrays of (pH-responsive, glucose-responsive, etc.) smart hydrogel pillars were fabricated within a microfluidics channel with large surface area-to-volume ratios (e.g., at least 40 mm\u22121). The pH response of these pillars was transduced into an electrical signal using a novel technique termed resistive channel sensing. The electronic signal obtained using this microfluidic pH sensor was shown to be reversible and reproducible. The response time of the microfluidic pH sensor was shown to decrease with increase in the surface area-to-volume ratio of the hydrogel pillars. The fabrication process presented here is a low-cost way to solve a long-standing problem of smart hydrogel analytical devices: namely, their long response times.",
