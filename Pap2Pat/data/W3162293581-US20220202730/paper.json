    "title": "5-Aminolevulinic Acid as a Novel Therapeutic for Inflammatory Bowel Disease",
    "date": "2021-05-20",
    "abstract": "5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a naturally occurring nonprotein amino acid licensed as an optical imaging agent for the treatment of gliomas. In recent years, 5-ALA has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties through upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 via enhancement of porphyrin, indicating that it may be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. This study systematically examines 5-ALA for use in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Firstly, the ex vivo colonic stability and permeability of 5-ALA was assessed using human and mouse fluid and tissue. Secondly, the in vivo efficacy of 5-ALA, in the presence of sodium ferrous citrate, was investigated via the oral and intracolonic route in an acute DSS colitis mouse model of IBD. Results showed that 5-ALA was stable in mouse and human colon fluid, as well as in colon tissue. 5-ALA showed more tissue restricted pharmacokinetics when exposed to human colonic tissue. In vivo dosing demonstrated significantly improved colonic inflammation, increased local heme oxygenase-1 levels, and decreased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 in both plasma and colonic tissue. These effects were superior to that measured concurrently with established anti-inflammatory treatments, ciclosporin and 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine). As such, 5-ALA represents a promising addition to the IBD armamentarium, with potential for targeted colonic delivery.",

                "The global prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has risen significantly in the last 30 years, with an increase of 85.1% in global cases from 1990 to 2017 [1,2]. IBD carries a heavy burden for both patients and healthcare providers [3]. In the U.S, lifetime healthcare costs for individuals with IBD average at over half a million dollars [4]. Physiologically, patients suffer from noninfectious chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, resulting in common symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss, rectal bleeding, and malnutrition [5,6]. It is recognised that these symptoms significantly impact patients\u2019 wellbeing and life chances: people with IBD statistically require more days off work than the general population [7,8]. The umbrella term IBD can be distinguished into two clinically distinct conditions: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In CD, inflammation can occur at any point along the GI tract and is typically transmural, affecting all layers of intestinal tissue [9,10]. In juxtaposition, GI inflammation in UC is confined to the colon and only affects mucosal tissue. The precise aetiology of both CD and UC remains incompletely characterised, though existing treatments mostly target a defective immune response [11,12,13].",
                "Existing IBD treatments do not adequately control disease in all patients. Initial treatments, including mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid, 5-ASA) corticosteroids, ciclosporin, tacrolimus and azathioprine, often do not lead to disease remission, and carry the risk of significant adverse effects [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. Patients who do not respond to first line therapies are typically offered biologic treatment, such as anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) like infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab [12,13,23,24,25]. To date, there are no orally administrable biologic therapies to treat IBD, thus patients must attend regular healthcare appointments to receive treatment [26]. The antibodies also act as systemic immunosuppressants, leading to multiple adverse effects, including an increased risk of lymphoma [27]. Small molecule based JAK inhibitors for treatment of moderate to severe UC also carry their risks, currently marked as \u2018black box\u2019 treatments due to post-marketing reports of pulmonary embolism [28,29]. Even though the emergence of IL12/23 and 23 inhibiting mAbs have been shown to overcome some of the safety challenges of anti-TNF mAbs, the risk of surgery for UC and CD patients is still high, with a substantial proportion of patients needing surgical intervention during their lifetimes [30,31,32]. Clearly, there remains a need for safe, efficacious and early interventional IBD treatments that prevent intestinal damage, and thus disease worsening and surgeries [33].",
                "5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a naturally occurring nonprotein amino acid. Endogenously, 5-ALA plays a key role in both heme production and catabolism [1,2]. Heme is an essential component of the haemoglobin tetramer, and also contributes towards healthy mitochondrial function [34]. Over the last 30 years, there has been much attention on the therapeutic potential of 5-ALA [35]. The small molecule has been cited as showing promise for treatment of numerous diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, endometriosis, and neurodegeneration [36,37,38]. 5-ALA has also recently been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [39]. Despite the wide scientific applications, 5-ALA is only licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as an optical imaging agent in patients with high-grade gliomas [40]. Administered orally, 5-ALA acts as a prodrug, whereby it is converted to fluorescent protoporphyrin (PpIX) by tumour cells, thus facilitating fluorescence-guided surgical resection [35]. Subsequently, 5-ALA has significantly increased patients\u2019 progression free survival and the amount of tumour removable during surgery, with a good safety profile [41]. Interestingly, during clinical trials, researchers noticed that 5-ALA was associated with false-positive fluorescence in up to 35% of tumour biopsies [35,42]. This fluorescent activity in the absence of tumour cells was attributed partly to 5-ALA uptake by non-cancerous inflammatory cells [43]. Uptake of 5-ALA in inflammatory conditions could have significant benefits for treatment of IBD. Following 5-ALA promoted heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalysed heme catabolism, carbon monoxide, iron, biliverdin, and bilirubin are liberated (Figure 1) [44]. Together, these molecules are thought to have antioxidative functions and regulate inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation through distinct yet synergistic effects [2]. Though the additive mechanisms are not yet fully characterised, their clinical relevance has been demonstrated in various disease states, from protection in renal ischaemia reperfusion injury, immunoregulation in heart transplantation, and amelioration of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [45,46,47]. The delivery of 5-ALA to the colon has also been documented, specifically for photodynamic detection of colon cancer and colitis [48,49]. HO-1, the rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, has been shown to play a protective role in intestinal damage [50,51,52]. Thus, HO-1 induction by 5-ALA may present a novel addition to the existing arsenal of IBD therapeutics.",
                "This study seeks to investigate the suitability of 5-ALA for treatment of IBD. Firstly, the ex vivo stability of 5-ALA in the colon and its colonic permeability are investigated using human and mouse tissue. Secondly, the efficacy of 5-ALA, in the presence of sodium ferrous citrate (SFC), is determined using an acute DSS colitis mouse model of IBD. SFC is formulated with 5-ALA as an iron component, to support 5-ALA\u2019s ability to promote HO-1 formation (Figure 1). Both oral and intracolonic routes are investigated, and 5-ALA performance is directly compared to that of two traditional IBD treatments: 5-ASA (mesalamine) and ciclosporin."

During tissue characterisation, human colonic tissue was found to have a pH of 7.01, and protease activity of 61,256 (\u00b18123) units/mL. Mouse tissue had a slightly lower pH of 6.71 and protease activity of 54,782 (\u00b18394) units/mL. Enzymes in the intestinal wall can contribute towards drug degradation [56], thus it is important to characterise drug susceptibility before oral administration to properly predict drug fate in situ. From this data, degradation of 5-ALA by colonic tissue enzymes is not expected to significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics.",

Using mouse tissue, 19% of 5-ALA diffused across the colonic epithelium fully after 3 h, and 2% was in the process of tissue permeation (Figure 3D). This data provides a basis for the assumption that 5-ALA delivered to the colonic lumen will largely remain gut-restricted, extending its availability for local therapeutic action."

This indication that colitis was superiorly treated by IR 5-ALA is echoed by the plasma concentrations of IL-6, as shown in Figure 5B.

However, both doses of IR 5-ALA resulted in a lower average plasma IL-1\u03b2 concentration than untreated controls (group 2).

There was no significant difference between low dose IR 5-ALA (group 10) and other IR treatment groups, including the group with the lowest mean TNF-\u03b1 concentration (group 8, IR ciclosporin, p = 0.18). Colonic tissue IL-6 concentrations again showed group 11 (high dose IR 5-ALA) to be the best performing 5-ALA therapy (Figure 6B). Group 11 achieved significantly lower IL-6 colonic tissue concentrations than PO low dose 5-ALA (group 5, p = 0.02) and PO high dose 5-ALA (group 6, p = 0.004). There was no significant difference between the lowest IL-6 treatment average (group 8, IR ciclosporin) and groups 10 and 11 (IR 5-ALA), indicating that IR 5-ALA was just as effective as a potent immunosuppressive agent like ciclosporin. This was reaffirmed by IL-1\u03b2 levels, wherein IR 5-ALA formulations were statistically comparative to ciclosporin formulations (Figure 6C). Low dose IR 5-ALA (group 10) also achieved statistically lower IL-1\u03b2 concentrations than IR 5-ASA (group 9, p = 0.04). Treatment with high dose IR 5-ALA (group 11) achieved similar IL-1\u03b2 results to the low dose IR 5-ALA formulation (group 10); however, it did not result in significantly better results than IR 5-ASA (group 9).

Furthermore, there does not seem to be a cumulative dose\u2013activity relationship; on several occasions, administration of low dose IR 5-ALA (group 10) has resulted in lower concentrations of inflammatory markers than high dose IR 5-ALA (group 11). This is surprising, as animals in group 11 received a tenfold dose increase compared to those in group 10. These results could indicate that efficacy of 5-ALA is dose-saturable, with dose increases above a certain threshold having no appreciating benefit."

High HO-1 levels in tissue compared to plasma are a positive sign that there is a local anti-inflammatory response to colitis. This is likely partially explained by an intrinsic physiological response to intestinal inflammation, as group 1 (the colitis-free control) had similar levels of HO-1 in plasma and colonic tissue, as opposed to group 2 (the untreated colitis control) with significantly more HO-1 in colonic tissue than plasma (p = 1.23 \u00d7 10\u22125). In addition, an increased colonic tissue HO-1 concentration can also be attributed to localised drug delivery, as shown by the IR formulations (groups 8\u201311). Groups 8, 9, and 11 achieved significantly higher concentrations of colonic tissue HO-1 than the IR placebo (group 7), showing that drug treatment does increase tissue HO-1 (p < 0.05).

In general, IR treatments resulted in higher HO-1 colonic tissue concentrations than the PO treatments (p = 1.72 \u00d7 10\u22127).

                        "The results of this study have presented 5-ALA as a promising addition to the IBD armamentarium. Firstly, 5-ALA is stable in the colonic environment, exhibiting resistance to degradation by colonic microbiota and tissue enzymes. Many drugs are susceptible to chemical transformation by colonic microbial enzymes, thus this data implies that 5-ALA can be relied upon to maintain a predictable concentration profile at its site of action [59,60,61]. In addition, 5-ALA did not show extensive permeability across the human colonic epithelium, indicating that it will primarily remain restricted in the colon tissue for local action where it is needed, with minimal systemic exposure and any associated adverse effects. When tested in a mouse model of colitis, 5-ALA demonstrated efficacy across numerous therapeutic indicators, including spleen weight, colon weight: length ratio, local and systemic inflammatory cytokines, and local HO-1 concentrations.",
                        "No clear adverse effects of 5-ALA treatment were observed during this preclinical study. In line with drug development guidelines, 5-ALA\u2019s toxicity profile will need to be systematically assessed for treatment of IBD; though, when used as an imaging agent, 5-ALA is recognised as a safe molecule [41,62]. In the case of SFC, iron supplements have a well-documented safety profile. Overall, 5-ALA delivered intrarectally achieved better results than when administered orally. Local delivery of drugs at the site of disease is often an efficacious way to enhance therapeutic action whilst decreasing the incidence of systemic side effects and the required dose [63]. Though IR administration of 5-ALA has been shown to be superior to PO administration in this study, a promising hybrid of the two could come in the form of targeted colonic delivery via the oral route [64]. Oral formulations that release the drug in the colon encompass the therapeutic advantages seen with local IR efficacy, whilst offering the patient acceptability and convenience seen with PO formulations [65,66]. 5-ALA could be delivered directly to the colon using targeted formulation. For example, Phloral\u00ae technology, used commercially for delivery of a high-dose mesalazine product for treatment of ulcerative colitis, could be applied to colonic 5-ALA delivery. Phloral\u00ae allows drugs to be orally administered and reliably delivered to the colon by releasing drug in response to shifts in intestinal pH and microbial enzymatic activity [67,68,69]. Finally, another interesting finding of this study was the lack of linear dose\u2013response relationship observed for 5-ALA. Two doses of 5-ALA were tested: 10 mg/kg and a tenfold increase of 100 mg/kg. In numerous instances, low dose 5-ALA outperformed the high dose group, for example, in plasma/tissue TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations. That said, in some cases, the converse was true; for example, high dose IR 5-ALA achieved significant results over all PO treatments in tissue HO-1 concentration, where the low dose IR group did not. Future dose-ascending studies should be employed to investigate 5-ALA\u2019s relationship with dose and efficacy in IBD."

Results demonstrated that 5-ALA is stable in the presence of colonic microbiota and tissue enzymes for up to 24 h. In addition, 5-ALA was revealed as being largely gut-restricted, with low concentrations able to diffuse across the human colonic epithelium. When tested in an IBD mouse model, 5-ALA was shown to decrease plasma and colonic tissue concentrations of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2. Such immunomodulatory effects were frequently superior to that seen with established IBD treatments, ciclosporin and 5-ASA. The anti-inflammatory enzyme, HO-1, was also significantly upregulated locally in colonic tissue by 5-ALA treatment. As delivery of 5-ALA was shown to achieve greater therapeutic benefit than traditional oral administration, the therapy would be ideally suited for oral targeted colonic delivery. Here, 5-ALA has demonstrated promise as a novel addition to the arsenal of therapeutics aimed at early interventional treatment of IBD. Future studies should focus on investigating 5-ALA\u2019s dose\u2013efficacy relationship and explore its specific delivery to the colon via the oral route."
