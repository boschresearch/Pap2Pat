                        "Probabilistic graphical models may be used in applications where an inference is to be derived; for example, the use applications can include health care and medicine (e.g., triage and clinical diagnosis), biology, genetics and forensics, finance and fault diagnosis, question answering systems for troubleshooting and customer assistance, and the like. Other example applications include: optimal control of mechanical systems (e.g., robotic arms) whose state can be inferred via the use of positional sensors or cameras, and object tracking via cameras, radar, infrared and other electromagnetic wave sensors. Such applications have a crucial requirement for quantifying an uncertainty of conclusions inferred from the models. Quantifying the uncertainty is a technical problem. The technical problem is susceptible to being addressed by using a posterior distribution to quantify the uncertainty.

A technical problem that the present disclosure seeks to address is how to improve these methods, for example in practical real-time control applications.",
                        "In some cases, MCMC methods may be implemented using quantum computing resources, e.g., by replacing standard MCMC with quantum annealing hardware when training some types of Bayesian networks and Markov networks. Despite initially promising empirical results, it has been found to be very difficult to show that using quantum computing resources is susceptible to providing any benefit. However, it has been considered that using gate-based quantum computers would be a more promising approach; there exist algorithms for implementing MCMC methods with proven asymptotic advantage, but they require error correction and other features that are not available in contemporary quantum computers.",

Embodiments of the present disclosure benefit from improving inference that is achievable using classical probabilistic models by using quantum computer processing resources. For example, embodiments of the present disclosure use \u201cBorn machines\u201d implemented via parameterized quantum circuits, wherein such machines are susceptible to function as quantum machine learning models that exhibit high expressivity. Moreover, embodiments of the present disclosure beneficially use gradient-based methods and amortization in their training phase of quantum generative models such as Born machines, as will be elucidated in greater detail below.",

Moreover, embodiments of the present disclosure use variational inference (VI), as aforementioned, that is applicable to real physical systems, for example for controlling complex manufacturing apparatus, robotics systems, self-drive vehicles and so forth. Results of the VI can be used at decision points in control algorithms that determine operation of the aforesaid real physical systems.",
                        "Next, in general overview, VI that is used in embodiments of the present disclosure will be elucidated in greater detail. When developing a probabilistic model p over some set of random variables y, the variables y can be continuous or discrete, depending on situation. Moreover, there will be available evidence for some variables in the model p; these variables that are supported by evidence x\u2286y are then observed, for example measured, namely fixed to values of the evidence, wherein it is convenient to use a vector notation x to denote a realization of these observed variable. It is assumed that x\u02dcp(x), meaning that the probabilistic model p is able to capture a distribution of observed data. In an event that it is desirable to infer a posterior distribution of unobserved variables of the model p, these are conveniently included in a set z:=y\\x. Denoting these unobserved data by a vector z, it is desirable to compute the posterior distribution p(z|x), namely a conditional probability of z given x. By definition, the conditional probability can be expressed in terms of a joint divided by a marginal, namely: p(z|x)=p(x,z)/p(x). However, from the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the joint can be written as p(x,z)=p(x|z)p(z). Conveniently, Bayes' theorem combines the two identities and yields a relationship: p(z|x)=p(x|z)p(z)/p(x).",
                        "It will be appreciated that Bayesian networks are known to be targeted to solve inference problems and are beneficially used in embodiments of the present disclosure. A Bayesian network describes a set of random variables with a clear conditional probability structure. This structure is a directed acyclic graph where conditional probabilities are modelled by explicit distributions, for example often modelled using tables, or by using neural networks. Referring to FIG. 1A, there is provided a textbook example of a Bayesian network for a distribution of binary variables, wherein the variables include cloudy (C), sprinkler (S), rain (R) and grass being wet (W). According to a graph shown in FIG. 1A, there is derived a distribution that factorizes as P(C,S,R,W)=P(C)P(S|C)P(R|C)P(W|S,R). In respect of the directed acyclic graph, a given inferential question is: what is the probability distribution of the variables C, S and R given W=tr ? (note: tr=true). The probability can be estimated by \u201cinverting\u201d the probabilities using Bayes' theorem, namely p(C, S, R|W=tr)=p(W=tr|C, S, R)p(C, S, R)/p(W).",
                        "In FIGS. 1B to 1Dd, there are shown additional use applications for utilizing inference derived from applying Bayesian networks. For example, in FIG. 1B, a hidden Markov model is illustrated by way of a joint probability distribution of a time series of asset returns and an unobserved \u201cmarket regime\u201d, for example a booming economic regime vs. a recessive economic regime. An example application for embodiments of the present disclosure is to detect regime switches by observing asset returns, or to implement measures to keep a given power generation plant stable in operation. In FIG. 1C, there is shown a modified version of a \u201clung cancer\u201d Bayesian network that can be used in apparatus that is configured to provide medical diagnosis when in use. The Bayesian network used is configured to encode expert knowledge about a relationship between risk factors, diseases and symptoms. It will be appreciated that, in health care, careful design of algorithms and Bayesian networks are critical in order to reduce biases when making inferences, for example in relation to health care access; moreover, it will be appreciated in relation to inference that medical diagnoses are often causal instead of associative.

                        "Contemporarily, it is found that inference is a computationally hard task to implement using classical (binary) computers, in all but simplest probabilistic models. Exact inference in Bayesian networks with discrete variables is #P-complete. Moreover, even approximate inference is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard); thus, unless some particular constraints are applied, such inference calculations are intractable using, for example, classical (binary) computers. Embodiments of the present disclosure seek to address such intractable calculations by using quantum computers. Conventionally, when tackling such inference computation using classical (binary) computers, there is performed a \u201cforward pass\u201d and unbiased samples are obtained from a joint (x,z)\u02dcp(x,z)=p(x|z)p(z). However, obtaining unbiased samples from a posteriors z\u02dcp(z|x)=p(x,z)/p(x) is intractable due to an associated unknown normalization constant. However, in such a situation, it is feasible to implement MCMC sampling by constructing an ergodic Markov chain whose stationary distribution is a desired posterior. A problem with such ergodic Markov chains is that may converge slowly in practice. In contrast to ergodic Markov chains, variational inference (VI) is often faster in high dimensions but does not provide guarantees. Without such guarantees, it is therefore a technical risk to apply such VI methods to control systems where safety is a critical issue. It will be appreciated that VI is configured to optimize a variational distribution q by minimizing its \u201cdistance\u201d from a true posterior p.",

                        "Embodiments of the present disclosure use an inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to model probability distributions of classical data in one or more simultaneous states within a quantum computer.

Here, |z represents computational basis states, wherein sampling the probabilities is implemented as a simple measurement in a quantum computer hosting the Born machines. Optionally, forms of discrete data can be processed by using suitable encoding. For example, when using amortization, a given variational distribution requires observed variables to be conditioned before being processed further. Optionally, in embodiments of the present disclosure, a parameter x is used as an additional parameter in order to yield a pure state where output probabilities are q\u03b8(z|x)=|z|\u03c8(\u03b8,x)|2. For example, in FIG. 2, there is shown an illustration of a relationship between a classical model for observed data and a quantum model for providing an approximate inference. In some cases, the classical model may comprise a prior over unobserved discrete variables and a likelihood over observed variables. The quantum model approximates a posterior distribution of the unobserved variables given observed data. Here it is assumed that the data distribution is the same as a marginal probability p(x)=\u03a3xp(x|z)p(z) from the classical model.

A quantum computer cannot efficiently implement arbitrary quantum circuits, thus some Born machines are intractable even for a quantum computer. For example, instantaneous quantum poly-time (IQP) circuits are Born machines with O(poly(n)) parameters that yield classically intractable distributions in an average case under widely accepted complexity theoretic assumptions. Thus, quantum Born machines have expressive power that is larger than that of classical models, including neural networks and partially matrix product states. It can be shown that the model remains classically intractable throughout training, which is itself a form of quantum advantage.
