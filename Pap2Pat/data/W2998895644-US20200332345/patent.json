                        "Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by a facultative intracellular pathogen, Francisella tularensis (hereafter, F. tularensis), that may be easily disseminated by a lethal dose of 10 organisms or less. As such, F. tularensis is a potential bioweapon able to cause a major health impact. F. tularensis is comprised of four subspecies: tularensis (type A), holarctica (type B), mediasiatica, and novicida. The type A subspecies is further separated into subtypes: A.I and A.II. These four subspecies and two subtypes differ considerably in virulence, with the type A.I clade possessing the greatest virulence and subspecies novicida possessing the least.",
                        "F. tularensis is distributed globally, with some stronger geographic associations, and can infect more species than any other known zoonotic pathogen. F. tularensis transmission occurs through oral, cutaneous, and conjunctival routes of exposure. Natural exposures to infected arthropods, animals, water, or food are common modes of infection. The most severe form of this disease is pneumonic tularemia that most likely results from the inhalation of contaminated (natural or man-made) aerosols. Fatality rates as high as 35% from a subtype A.I infection have been reported.",
                        "From a Public Health (\u201cPH\u201d) and DoD Force Health Protection (\u201cFHP\u201d) perspective, it is imperative to know if a potential exposure from a virulent F. tularensis strain, particularly a subtype A.I strain has occurred. However, all forms of tularemia, if untreated, can lead to hematogenous spread and eventual acute renal failure. While appropriate medical management is key for all exposures, rapid, accurate, and stand-alone identification of the F. tularensis subspecies and subtype is imperative to ensure that respiratory protection is considered when appropriate; however, this capability is currently lacking.",
                        "For example, the inability to subspeciate F. tularensis was observed in 2005 at a large gathering on the Capital Mall in Washington, D.C. U.S. Government BioWatch sensors were triggered, and the Centers for Disease and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) issued a health advisory to healthcare personnel of possible tularemia exposure. Specimens obtained at the event were later analyzed and shown to contain signatures from F. tularensis subspecies novicida, a naturally-occurring, non-select agent that is not virulent. Had the subspecies been identified prospectively on-site, the CDC health advisory would have been unnecessary.",
                        "A number of other related, avirulent bacterial strains further complicate the positive identification of F. tularensis, such as Francisella persica (a nonpathogenic tick endosymbiont formally classified as Wolbachia persica).",
                        "Conventional polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) assays do not offer accurate subspecies and subtype differentiation. These methods are also not able to definitively identify all four subspecies of F. tularensis with sufficient simplicity that identification may be done in or near the point of operations. Research and reference laboratory methods and platforms capable of F. tularensis subspeciation are known, but require a complex scoring matrix and are only able to differentiate three of the four F. tularensis subspecies.",
                        "Thus there remains a need for rapid, portable, and accurate stand-alone detection assays that can differentiate all four F. tularensis subspecies and the two type-A subtypes. Such assays should be suitable for deployment in Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (\u201cJBAIDS\u201d), or for next generation platforms (such as sequencing or dense array PCR) that will eventually replace JBAIDS."

The singleplex qPCR assay embodiments detect each F. tularensis target separately; in the multiplexed qPCR assay embodiments, different targets may be multiplexed in a single tube. The qPCR assays, according to embodiments of the present invention, are operable on the currently fielded DoD JBAIDS (BioFire Defense, Salt Lake City, Utah), the APPLIED BIOSYSTEMS 7500 Fast instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), the 3M Integrated Cycler (Focus Diagnostics of Diasorin Molecular, LLC, Cypress, California), as well as most other real-time PCR instruments. Furthermore, assays according to embodiments of the present invention may be operated by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequence-based genotyping that is compatible on most DNA sequencers, such as but not limited to, the Ion Torrent (Thermo Fisher, formerly Life Technologies, Corp.).

According to some embodiments, mere detection of a certain qualitative product by sequence is sufficient to be diagnostic for a given F. tularensis subspecies or subtype. The non-specific detector embodiments (those that make amplicon from more than one strain) contain numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (\u201cSNP\u201d) that are indicative of F. tularensis subspecies.",
                        "Referring now to the figures, and in particular to FIG. 1, a method 20 of detecting the F. tularensis species, a subspecies thereof, a subtype thereof, or a combination thereof is described in greater detail. The method 20 begins with obtaining a suspect specimen that the operator would desire a test for the presence of F. tularensis (or F. tularensis nucleic acid) or related bacteria (or bacterial nucleic acid) (Block 22). Such specimen may be, but is not limited to, food, water, soil, insects, arthropods, and human clinical specimens. Genomic DNA is extracted from the suspected specimen by standard methods or other practical means (Block 24). For PCR, however, and as would be understood by the skilled artisan, the specimen may be directly assessed using such methods without the need for isolation of genomic DNA (Optional Block 26).",

Alternatively, (\u201cPCR SEQUENCE\u201d branch of Decision Block 28), primers are selected and prepared according to a desired level of detection, wherein the desired detection level may be species, subspecies, or subtype (Block 30\u2032). Generally, the composition and formula of the reaction is dependent on the make and model of the instruments to be employed, as well as whether the reaction is performed singleplex or multiplex. Likewise, probe fluorophores (and quenchers in qPCR variants) are selected for detection by the intended instrument. Such compositions, formulations, and preparations are known to those having ordinary skill in the art and the benefit of the disclosure provided herein.",

Therefore, each selection includes a negative control assay, a positive control assay, and at least one identifying assay. A product of the negative control assay sequence facilitates a determination of whether a contaminant is present (e.g., DNA template carry over); a product of the positive control assay sequence (i.e., an appropriate DNA target) suggests no inhibitors are present in the reaction and reagents are functioning as expected.",

Such assay will yield a positive product for any sample containing bacterial DNA and provides evidence that the PCR or qPCR reaction was not inhibited. Determination of non-inhibition enables an operator to correctly assess a negative result. Without a proper amplification control, the operator may falsely assume that no product production means that F. tularensis is not present in the sample being tested, when in reality, the assay has failed to work due to the presence of inhibitory compounds or substances.",

The flowchart 32 may be used in determining which assays are selected. At start, a determination as to whether contamination is present within the specimen is made (Decision Block 34), which may also be considered to be a quality control check of the sample preparation. If a product results (\u201cYES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 34), then a contaminant may be present and the sample preparation fails quality control (Block 36). If no (\u201cNO\u201d Branch of Decision Block 34), then a determination as to whether a bacterium is present within the specimen is made (Decision Block 38). If no product is observed (\u201cNO\u201d Branch of Decision Block 38), then either no bacteria is present or the reaction failed due to a presence of inhibitors (for example) (Block 40). Confirmation of reaction failure may optionally be performed by diluting the sample and returning to Decision Block 34 (not shown); otherwise, the process ends. If a product is observed (\u201cYES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 38), the presence of bacteria (or bacterial nucleic acid) is confirmed and the process continues (Block 42).",

If the assay does not yield a product (\u201cNO\u201d Branch of Decision Block 50), then the F. tularensis that is present within the sample may be the novicida subspecies (Block 54); however, such determination is not definitive. For confirmation of the presence of the subspecies novicida (or subsp. novicida nucleic acid), the method may optionally continue (Optional Arrow A) to further determination by one or more of the N1, N2, N3, and N4 assays (Decision Block 56, FIG. 3). If a product results from one or more of these assays (\u201cYES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 56), then the nonvirulent F. tularensis subspecies novicida is present (Block 58).",

Instead, as shown in FIG. 4, the number and type of assays selected depends on the desired detection level. For example, if the desired detection level is to assess whether the F. tularensis species is present (\u201cSPECIES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 86), then only the U16S and 4PAN1 assays are necessary (Block 88). If further determination of subspecies is desired (\u201cSUBSPECIES\u201d Branch from \u201cSPECIES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 86), then the B2, M3, and at least one of N1, N2, N3, and N4 assay need be used (Block 90). Optionally, in determining subspecies, the 3PAN assay may be used in addition to in or place of the 4PAN1 assay (Block 92). Alternatively, if the virulence of the detected species or subspecies is desired (\u201cVIRULENCE\u201d Branch from \u201cSPECIES\u201d Branch of Decision Block 86), then the 3PAN assays are necessary (Block 94). If subtype is desired, (\u201cSUBTYPE\u201d Branch of Decision Block 86), then U165, 4PAN1 (alternatively or also including 3PAN), MD, and A2C assays are necessary (Block 96).

As to PCR and qPCR, a high stringency conventional PCR reaction may proceed (Blocks 100, 102). As to sequencing, a low stringency PCR may be used (Block 104). The low stringency PCR reaction generates background amplification and permits some miss-priming, which extends the number of products generated by the detectors. The prepare reactions may be executed according to the particular parameters for the equipment and instruments used and as would be understood by the skilled artisan (Block 106) and products of the reactions observed (Block 108). PCR only variants may be scored via intercalating dyes (e.g., SYBR Green) or by directly observing the amplified and stained DNA following gel fractionation, if desired. Amplification using qPCR is diagnostic for the various strain types and hydrolysis of the probe provides a quantitative measurement of the detected genomic DNA that is observed by real-time fluorescence.",

The resulting DNA products may then be pooled and sequenced in accordance with the methods and instructions of any given manufacture of sequencer instrumentation. The resulting DNA data may be assembled into theoretical contiguous DNA pieces using any assembler software suited to the task. The assembly corrects errors and removes duplicated data, making the analysis easier.",

Such undesired sequences may include, for example, human DNA or human RNA if the specimen was human in nature. Of the remaining sequences within the filtered amplicon library, a number (n) are randomly selected to form a set (Block 116). While n may vary, and depends largely on the number of sequences within the amplicon library, an n value of 100 may be considered typical.",

In some instances, which may be probable for sequences associated with the A1d, A2c, B2, and M3 (for example, S1, S4, and S5 of FIG. 6A) the result may be a single hit. Thus, accurate strain identification may be determined if an exact sequence match occurs to an organism in the database or listing of F. tularensis sequences.",

For example, a given U16S amplicon product may be a near exact match to many related strains because each strain will possess some homology. As such, the product is not specifically diagnostic, but does identify the presence of bacteria or bacterial nucleic acids. Therefore, the full list of all potential detections in a facultative identification may be reported. Moreover, the U16S assay may provide a DNA barcoding assay of sorts. The enclosed control-barcoding detector, when used with the more specific F. tularensis assays described in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, provides cooperative identification and exclusion effects via multilocus sequencing for every strain in the sample.",

In the illustrated example of FIG. 6A, S1 is provided as an entropy value of 1, S2 is provided as an entropy value of 3, and so forth. For instance, if the entropy score is one, then only one genome/strain is identified and the identity of that genome/strain may be recorded as the closest identification.",

To meet this gap, molecular-diagnostic testing, including singleplex subspecies differentiating real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, multiplex qPCR assays, and those that are sequence-based are proposed. These methodologies provide a set of tools to combat the threat of infection in a deployed scenario by allowing more accurate field detection of the F. tularensis pathogen. Consequently, method described herein according to embodiments of the present invention offer several improvements in the art of pathogen detection by providing a test that may be operated with PCR, qPCR, and sequencing technology. The method allows for the rapid deployment of robust assays with no foreknowledge requirement and provides unprecedented levels of organism detection.",
                                "The method can provide precise identification of even new and previously unobserved pathogens by their DNA sequence. Ultimately, such tools are an essential part of future etiological detection of disease and the epidemiology of pathogens in, but not limited to, the recruit and enlisted populations and emergency first responders, as well as the environment.",
                                "Because the four F. tularensis subspecies and the two type-A subtypes differ considerably in virulence, correctly identifying the stain type is critical for the appropriate response to a detection event. The PCR-based and sequence-based methods described herein are a vast improvement over other current assays, since this method can identify and differentiate the virulent F. tularensis strains from avirulent F. tularensis strains and other closely related nonpathogenic species, such as F. philomiragia, F. persica, and Francisella-like endosymbionts known to exist in ticks and other arthropod and insects (e.g., mosquitoes and deer. flies). Thus the method as described according to the various embodiments herein (i) can differentiate the four F. tularensis subspecies and two type-A subtypes in PCR-based assays, real-time quantitative singleplex PCR assays, or real-time quantitative multiplex PCR assays without the need for a scoring matrix, (ii) can detect strain variation and is operable in a sequencing, PCR and/or real-time quantitative PCR based method, and (iii) is adaptable for the identification of emerging or novel pathogens of operational concern.",

Embodiments of the method may comprise one or more multiplex assays or up to seven independent assays having one target each for speciation, subspeciation, subtyping, or a combination thereof.",
