    "abstract": "Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is premature delivery prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy and is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. sPTB is associated with a unique gene expression profile. Identified herein are numerous safe and proven therapeutic compositions used for unrelated indications that have the biological effect of reversing, in part, the gene expression profile of sPTB and which can be used in preventative or interventional treatments to prevent, delay, or ameliorate sPTB. The repurposed drugs include several Class A and Class B therapeutics that are regarded as safe or low risk in pregnant subjects.",

                        "Preterm birth (PTB) or birth before 37 weeks of gestation is the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. According to global estimates in 2015, complications arising from PTB were responsible for 35.5% of neonatal deaths (and 17.8% of deaths in children under 5). Estimated rates of PTB vary by country with rates as low as 5% and as high as 18%, with a worldwide estimate of 11.1%. Even in non-fatal cases, prematurely-born children are at a higher risk for life-long neurodevelopmental sequelae, such as motor and cognitive impairments. Approximately two-thirds of PTB cases are spontaneous preterm births (sPTBs), an umbrella term for both spontaneous preterm labor (early onset of regular contractions and cervical changes) and preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM, early water breaking). sPTB is difficult to predict, with ongoing studies focused on identifying biological and demographic risk factors as well as potential warning signs during pregnancy. Some studies have suggested that sPTB may be caused by changes in the maternal immune system or in the interplay between the fetal and maternal immune systems.",
                        "While early diagnosis and identification of patients at risk for sPTB is an important goal, there are very few therapeutic options available to prevent sPTB. Cervical cerclage, a surgical procedure to close the cervix, has been shown to have some success in preventing sPTB, however, it is an invasive procedure. For pharmacological measures, vaginally-applied progesterone (P4) supplementation has shown some success in preventing PTB in women with short cervixes. In 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved injections of hydroxyprogesterone caproate, a synthetic progestin P4, to prevent recurrent sPTB in the USA. However, these treatments have limited success, reducing the risk of PTB by approximately one-third. Accordingly, there remains a need in the art foe new therapies and preventative medicines for PTB."

                        "Traditional development of novel pharmaceuticals is both expensive and time-consuming. Drug repositioning, or drug \u201crepurposing\u201d, is the process of discovering new indications for existing drugs. By searching for new applications of drugs that are already FDA-approved for use in humans, development time and costs can be substantially reduced. Existing drugs have already undergone extensive clinical testing and development and have well-established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. Some examples of successful repositioning include atomoxetine for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sildenafil for erectile dysfunction, and finasteride for hair loss. Safety is an especially important consideration within the context of pregnancies; therefore, by working with existing approved drugs, such as FDA-approved drugs, potential drugs for prevention of sPTB with no known adverse effects to the mother or the fetus could potentially be identified.",
                        "With the increasing availability of large public datasets, computational drug repositioning has emerged as a potential approach to identify novel indications for existing drugs. Gene expression microarrays have been used extensively to study genome-wide effects of perturbagens (e.g. drugs) as well as disease states. Differential gene expression profiles can be generated by comparing microarray data from drug-treated samples with those of unperturbed samples. These profiles consist of genes that are up- or down-regulated in cells treated with different compounds relative to those unperturbed. Similarly, disease gene expression signatures can be generated by comparing disease samples with healthy controls. One computational approach utilizes a pattern-matching strategy to find drugs and diseases with opposite differential gene expression profiles\u2014that is, combinations in which genes up- or down-regulated in a disease are down- or up-regulated, respectively, by drug treatment. The hypothesis behind this strategy is that if a disease with a set of gene changes is matched with a drug with the opposite set of gene changes, then that drug could potentially be used therapeutically for the disease.",
                        "During pregnancy, the immune system maintains a tolerogenic anti-inflammatory state by proliferating regulatory T-cells until late gestation. At the end of pregnancy, a switch to a pro-inflammatory state promotes labor. To sustain pregnancy, the balance between innate and adaptive immune cells must be maintained, with a premature shift in the balance potentially leading to preterm labor. In a prior study by the inventors of the present disclosure, a cross-study meta-analysis was performed to identify genome-wide differences associated with sPTB, as described in Vora, et al. Meta-Analysis of Maternal and Fetal Transcriptomic Data Elucidates the Role of Adaptive and Innate Immunity in Preterm Birth. Front Immunol. 2018;9:993. Pathway analyses of these genes identified enrichment in immune-related pathways, with sPTB associated with the up-regulation of innate immunity and down-regulation of adaptive immunity. In particular, genes that were down-regulated were involved in biological processes including T-cell receptor signaling and transduction, B-cell receptor signaling, leukocyte activation, and lymphocyte activation. Upregulated innate immunity processes included IL-1-signaling and neutrophil degranulation.",
                        "With the immune system implicated in sPTB, the inventors of the present disclosure applied a computational drug repositioning approach to drug and disease gene expression profiles to identify potential new treatments for sPTB. FIG. 1 summarizes the general workflow of the repositioning search. Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public genomics data repository administered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, contains over 103,000 gene expression studies across 2.6 million microarray samples. Data in GEO was used to first identify a human gene expression profile of sPTB, followed by querying existing drug gene expression profiles (derived from human cell lines) from the Connectivity Map (CMap) and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) L1000 datasets, resulting in the identification a set of drugs with reversed differential gene expression profiles from that of sPTB. The identified drugs are medications that are all currently used in humans for different indications.",
                        "P4, the existing standard for preventing sPTB, is one of the 83 compounds identified in the screen. Of the identified drugs, 81 of these have a higher reversal score than P4. The list was further narrowed down by focusing on those with plausible safety profiles that fall within the pregnancy category A or B designation, yielding a total of 13 potential drugs.",
                        "Provided herein are novel therapeutic methods for the prevention of sPTB, by the novel administration of certain known agents to subjects at risk of sPTB, wherein the agents partially reverse gene expression profiles associated with sPTB, creating a therapeutic effect that prevents or treats sPTB. The methods of the invention are described in more detail next."

                        "In a primary implementation, the treatment is a preventative treatment administered to a subject at risk of sPTB. The treatment may also be an interventional treatment applied to a subject undergoing premature delivery, in order to inhibit delivery, delay delivery, or decrease fetal morbidity or mortality. In one embodiment, the subject at risk of sPTB is a pregnant subject at any stage of pregnancy. In some embodiments, the subject is a pregnant subject at between 8 weeks and 37 weeks, a pregnant subject at between 16 weeks and 37 weeks, a pregnant subject at between 8 weeks and successful delivery, a subject at between 16 weeks and successful delivery, or a subject at any other stage of pregnancy.

                        "The treatment encompasses the administration of one or more sPTB-reversing agents. An sPTB-reversing agent is any composition of matter which partially reverses differential gene expression of one or more sPTB genes. An sPTB gene, as used herein, is a gene wherein the expression of the gene is typically altered in subjects having sPTB, for example, being upregulated or downregulated as compared to its expression in pregnant subjects not having sPTB. For example, if a gene's expression is increased in sPTB, the selected sPTB-reversing agent will decrease the expression of the gene, and likewise, if a gene is downregulated in sPTB, the selected sPTB-reversing agent will increase the expression of the sPTB gene. In one embodiment, the sPTB gene is a gene selected from Table 2. With respect to an enumerated sPTB gene, an sPTB-reversing agent is a composition of matter that reverses the sPTB-associated upregulation or downregulation of the gene, for example, partially or wholly reversing the sPTB expression level. In various embodiments, the reversal is at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or full reversal of the differential expression of the gene observed in sPTB subjects.",

The Connectivity Map: using gene-expression signatures to connect small molecules, genes, and disease. Science. 2006;313(5795):1929-1935 and the LINCS L1000 dataset, as described in Subramanian et al. A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 platform and the first 1,000,000 profiles. Cell. 2017;171(6):1437-1452.e17. Both are collections of differential gene expression profiles of cultured human cells treated with a variety of small molecule perturbagens. Using DNA microarrays to assay mRNA expression, the creators of CMap generated a broad database cataloging the effects of drugs on genes. CMap is a deep, genome-wide profiling of the effects of approximately 1,300 drugs on a variety of cell lines. The LINCS L1000 dataset can be characterized as a shallow profiling (978 genes) of over 10,000 drugs. While the depth of the CMap dataset and the breadth of the LINCS L1000 dataset provide two complementary views into the effects of drugs on gene expression, the genome-wide aspect of the CMap was utilized in the present disclosure. Of the 210 differentially-expressed genes identified by the sPTB meta-analysis study, 159 were also profiled in CMap, while only 16 were profiled in LINCS.

To identify potential therapeutic drugs, a non-parametric rank-based method was used to identify candidates based on differential gene expression profiles as described in Sirota M, et al. Discovery and Preclinical Validation of Drug Indications Using Compendia of Public Gene Expression Data. Science Translational Medicine. 2011;3(96):96ra77; Dudley JT, et al. Computational Repositioning of the Anticonvulsant Topiramate for Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Science Translational Medicine. 2011;3(96):96ra76; Chen B, et al. Computational Discovery of Niclosamide Ethanolamine, a Repurposed Drug Candidate That Reduces Growth of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells In Vitro and in Mice by Inhibiting Cell Division Cycle 37 Signaling. Gastroenterology. 2017;152(8):2022-2036; and Chen B, et al. Reversal of cancer gene expression correlates with drug efficacy and reveals therapeutic targets. Nature Communications. 2017;8:16022. The goal was to identify drugs with gene changes that are the reverse of those observed in sPTB. Based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, this type of analysis was originally suggested by Lamb et al. in their original publication of the CMap database. This was extended and applied in the present study to specifically identify new uses for existing drugs. Build 02 version of CMap was used to obtain genome-wide gene expression profiles (relative to controls) from a variety of cell lines treated with small-molecule perturbagens. This database provided differential gene expression profiles (\u02dc22,000 genes) for 1,309 drugs/compounds cultured in up to 5 different cell lines. A total of 6,100 drugs were tested with variations in both concentrations and durations of treatment. A pre-filtering step was applied for the profiles similar to a previous computational drug repurposing pipeline. Of the 210 differentially-expressed genes identified by the cross-study meta-analysis, 159 (44 up- and 115 down-regulated, Table 2) were present in the drug gene expression profiles in CMap. Drugs were given scores based on the relationship between their differential gene expression profiles relative to the sPTB gene expression profile. A negative score indicated a reverse profile between the drug and sPTB, where the up-regulated genes in sPTB were lower ranked (more down-regulated) and the down-regulated genes in sPTB were higher ranked (more up-regulated) in the drug profiles. Conversely, a positive score indicated a similar profile between the drug and sPTB. Significances of scores were obtained by a comparison to a distribution of scores generated from random permutations and then adjusted for multiple comparisons; only scores with FDR<0.05 were kept. For drugs with multiple gene expression profiles (from testing on different cell lines and dosages), the profile with the lowest negative (most reversed) score was used.",
                                "Statistical Analysis. Reversal scores were generated for sPTB-drug pairs using a non-parametric, rank-based method based on the Kolgomorov-Smirnov test. Reversal score p-values were obtained by comparing to a distribution of 100,000 random scores and then adjusted via FDR for multiple comparisons. An individual random score was generated by selecting a random subset of genes matching the disease signature (44 ranked up-regulated genes, 115 ranked down-regulated genes) from the entire CMap gene list to act as a proxy signature and then compared to a random CMap drug for score calculation. To ensure that the significance of the score is specific to the drug in question, for one candidate drug, lansoprazole, we also compared 1,000 random input signatures to the lansoprazole profile. The PTB reversal score for lansoprazole was more extreme than each of the 1,000 generated random scores for lansoprazole, highlighting the significance of the findings. For testing the distributions in the mouse model studies, comparisons were made using the 2-tailed Student's t-test and adjusted via FDR for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.",
                                "Results. Computational identification of drug repositioning candidates. By comparing the drug signatures from CMap with the differential gene expression for sPTB, 83 sPTB-reversing drugs were identified, including P4, which significantly reversed the disease gene expression signature. This list can be narrowed down by safety profiles during pregnancy. In the past, the FDA applied broad labels known as pregnancy categories to drugs based on results from both human and animal studies. Letter grades of categories were broadly based upon risk to the pregnant mother and her fetus. Pregnancy category B corresponds to drugs that have failed to demonstrate risk in animal studies with no adequate studies in pregnant women, while pregnancy category A is reserved for drugs for which human studies have failed to demonstrate a risk. By ruling out drugs with no known pregnancy category and drugs with pregnancy categories with positive evidence of risk, a subset of thirteen category A or category B compounds was identified, including cefotaxime, lansoprazole, iopamidol, iohexol, iodixanol, rifabutin, chlorotalidone, benzathine benzylpenicillin, metformin, folic acid, chotrimazole, maprotiline, and progesterone. Notably, P4 is one of the thirteen drug hits identified. Only one pregnancy category A drug was identified: folic acid. Belonging to pregnancy category B are P4 and 11 of the other drugs: three antibiotics (benzathine benzylpenicillin and cefotaxime, and rifabutin), an antifungal (clotrimazole), a PPI (lansoprazole), an antidepressant (maprotiline), an anti-diabetic (metformin), an antihypertensive (chlortalidone), and three contrast agents (iopamidol, iohexol, and iodixanol). Each of the compounds exhibited a clear reversal of the sPTB gene expression signature.",
                                "Common protein interactions among 13 pregnancy category A/B drug hits. Using DrugBank as a reference, 27 proteins that interact with at least 2 of the drug hits were identified. By using these interactions to construct a network (FIG. 2), shared interactions between the drug hits can be visualized (with no interactions recorded for the three contrast agents). Common proteins include members of the cytochrome P450 family (most commonly CYP2D6), members of solute carrier family 22, and multidrug resistance protein 1 (ABCB1). Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is the only common protein that is also shared by the PTB signature.",
                                "Inflammation-induced mouse model validation of lansoprazole. Despite having the highest reversal score, cefotaxime shares few protein interactions. Lansoprazole has the next highest reversal score. Moreover, lansoprazole is available over-the- counter, whereas cefotaxime requires a prescription. Lansoprazole has also been connected to the stress-response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and deficiencies in HO-1 have been linked with pregnancy disorders. Thus, a validation study of lansoprazole was conducted. A mouse model of inflammation using LPS to induce fetal wastage in pregnant mice was employed. In addition to lansoprazole, P4 was tested as a positive control since it is currently indicated for the prevention of sPTB. The counts of viable mouse fetuses at E12.5 for each treatment group are summarized in FIG. 3A and 3B. The LPS-100 group had significantly (p<0.05) fewer viable fetuses compared to the saline group, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LPS- induced model. Treatment with oil (oil+LPS-100) alone (P4 vehicle) had no effect on fetal viability. The positive control group (3\u00d7P4+LPS-100) showed some effectiveness at recovering the number of viable fetuses at E12.5. Lastly, LPS-100 alone was compared to the lansoprazole group (3\u00d7lansoprazole+LPS-100). The lansoprazole group was able to significantly (P<0.05) increase the number of viable fetuses compared with LPS-100 alone. Treatment with 5% DMSO (DMSO+LPS-100) alone (lansoprazole vehicle) had no effect on fetal viability.",

As the data were derived from human gene expression, the physiology of sPTB should be especially represented in the drug predictions. Thirteen of these drugs\u2014benzathine benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, chlortalidone, clotrimazole, folic acid, iodixanol, iohexol, iopamidol, lansoprazole, maprotiline, metformin, P4, and rifabutin\u2014belong to pregnancy category A or B, indicating no known risk in pregnant women.",

Progesterone and the risk of preterm birth among women with a short cervix. N Engl J Med. 2007;357(5):462-469. Clotrimazole, an anti-fungal with no teratogenic effects, is used to treat yeast and fungal infections. An analysis of 17 years of Hungarian births found that mothers receiving clotrimazole treatment during pregnancy tended to have longer pregnancies, with a significant reduction in the rate of PTB, suggesting a protective effect that could not be explained by other factors, as described in Czeizel et al., Preterm birth reduction after clotrimazole treatment during pregnancy. Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2004;116(2):157-163.
