    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the provision of genetically modified fungal cells, such as yeast cells with an improved ability for producing different fatty acids and specifically fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), the main components of biodiesel. An increased in fatty acid production, and hence in FAEE, is obtained in the first place by expressing different heterologous polypeptides in combination with the down-regulation, attenuation, deletion or over-expression of specially selected genes, wherein said genes encode enzymes involved in the fatty acids synthesizing pathway, fatty acid consuming pathways, carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways or enzyme acting as wax ester transporters or a combination thereof. The methods and products of the invention would allow large-scale production of FAEE with carbohydrates as the only externally-supplied substrate.",

                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The present invention relates to the development of genetically engineered microorganisms that can produce wax esters in a controllable and economic fashion. More specifically the invention relates to the production of liquid wax esters that can be used for biofuel, lubricants, cosmetics, linoleum, printing inks as well as products related thereto, and for the production of solid wax esters used for candles and polishes as well as products related thereto.",
                        "2. Description of the Related Art",
                        "Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, have been powering modern society for more than one century. However, fresh discoveries of deposits are on the wane and demands are increasing. The world's demand of fossil fuels will soon outweigh the current supply. An innovative approach offering some solution comes from the biotechnology industries. Efforts have made biodiesel as one of the most thoroughly developed and promising alternative fuels on the market. It works well in conventional diesel engines, with less hazardous emissions, and is consumed at greater than 3.5 billion gallons per year.",
                        "Biodiesel is generally composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), and is mostly derived from vegetable oil or animal fat by chemically transesterification with methanol or ethanol. Despite the fact that ethanol-yielded FAEEs have better performances, for cost reasons methanol is the reagent most frequently used for triglyceride transesterification. The current process has several drawbacks, including energy intensiveness, consuming edible feedstocks, difficulty of removal of the catalyst from the product and treatment of toxic waste-water, as well as geographical and seasonal restrictions.",
                        "To overcome the problems related to the use of catalysts people have been exploring new alternatives such as enzymatic conversion using lipases (EC 3.1.1.3, triacylglycerol hydrolases). Lipases can break down neutral lipids such as triglycerides and perform a transesterification reaction in a solvent system (i.e. tert-butanol). Enzymatic production of biodiesel can be carried out at moderate reaction conditions and at a lower alcohol to oil ratio. The main drawbacks with this kind of enzymatic catalysis are the strong inactivation effect caused by alcohols (i.e. methanol) and the high enzyme costs.",
                        "Both chemical and enzymatic transesterification require the use of toxic, petrochemically-derived alcohols and expensive feedstocks. Thus, transesterification-based biodiesel becomes unsustainable when fossil fuel derived products are used. As a result, the current feedstocks for biodiesel are mainly derived from plant oils like rapeseed oil.",
                        "However such plant oils are inherently limited by supply of water and land, and subsequently, they cannot produce enough biofuel without threatening food supplies and/or native biodiversity. Algae are a promising choice as an alternative feedstock. Nevertheless, there are problems with surface usage and oil extraction from algae based production. Everyone agrees that fuels derived from biomass are one of the best alternatives to fossil fuels. Thus, genetically manipulation of microorganisms to produce fatty acid esters, will substantially contribute to produce environmentally friendlier, sustainable, and cost-effective biodiesels.",
                        "In this regard, it was previously shown that an engineered E. coli strain expressing the wax synthase (WS) from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and ethanol-production genes from Z. mobilis, could produce fatty acid ethyl esters by esterifying exogenously added fatty acids (Kalscheuer, Stolting et al. 2006). The research is an excellent demonstration of feasibility for microbial production of fatty acid esters. Recently, researchers from the Keasling group and the company LS9 Inc. (South San Francisco, USA) developed this idea further by constructing an engineered E. coli that can produce fatty-acid-derived fuels and chemicals from simple sugars and plant-derived biomass, without the need for fatty acid feeding (Steen, Kang et al. 2010). Production of fatty acid derivatives as biofuels has also been reported in recent patent applications WO2009/009391, WO2007136762 and WO2008119082, all owned by LS9 Inc. Briefly, the metabolically engineered E. coli strain was manipulated to be able to produce fatty (acid) esters and derivatives thereof (short and long chain alcohols, hydrocarbons, fatty alcohols, waxes, etc.) through the introduction of several genes encoding for enzymes such as thioesterase, wax synthase, alcohol acyltransferase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and different kinds of fatty alcohol forming acyl-CoA reductases. In U.S. patent publication 2010/0071259, inventors from the same company teach that by adding a mixture of at least two different alcohols to a medium containing the engineered E. coli strain that produces fatty esters, at least two different fatty esters could be produced.",
                        "The afore-mentioned biodiesel producing methods are all based on the use of the bacterium E. coli. However, E. coli is unable to naturally overproduce the two substrates of biodiesel, fatty acids and alcohol (i.e. ethanol), and this organism is not suitable for large-scale production that often involves harsh environmental conditions. Furthermore, E. coli is sensitive to phage contamination often resulting in substantial economic losses. The patents of the prior art successfully teach several strategies to enhance fatty acids biosynthesis in E. coli. Nevertheless, and apart from the drawbacks associated with the use of this host, it should be noted that strategies working in E. coli might not be appropriate when applied in other microorganisms.",
                        "A far better choice of microbial cell factory for industrial production of biodiesel would be the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast is already widely used in industry, including for large-scale bioethanol production, but also for a range of specialty chemicals. The development of S. cerevisiae as a cell factory for biodiesel production would represent a major contribution as this could represent a plug and play solution where current infrastructures used for production of bioethanol could be used for production of far more valuable biodiesels. In contrast to the insufficient ethanol productivity of E. coli, S. cerevisiae is already a good ethanol producer.",
                        "In fact, production of FAEEs and fatty acid isoamyl esters (FAIEs) has been achieved in recombinant S. cerevisiae with oleic acid addition by expressing the A. baylyi bifunctional WS/DGAT enzyme (Kalscheuer, Luftmann et al. 2004). A recent patent application, namely US patent application 2009/0117629 by Schmidt-dannert and Holtzapple, also describes a method for the production of esters, including isoprenoid wax esters and fatty acid alkyl esters, such as FAME and FAEE, by heterologous expression of Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus wax synthase (WS2) in S. cerevisiae. The invention is however, limited to the use of specific isolated polynucleotides from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, and its application in e.g. producing biodiesel). Moreover this method requires exogenous supply of fatty acids as the endogeneous production of fatty acids by yeast is too low to ensure economically viable production of FAEEs.",
                        "A modified strain carrying the genes encoding the wax synthase from Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus could be considered a potential host for biodiesel production in yeasts. Nonetheless, while this product is very suitable for the particular purpose it addresses, it is not the ideal option when the synthesis of other esters is desired. The knowledge of the preferred substrates for each wax synthase allows the use of yeast cells in applications other than biodiesel production. Moreover there is still a need for methods and products allowing large-scale production of fatty acid esters.",
                        "Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved fungal cell factory, such as a yeast cell factory that can be used for fermentation based production of FAEEs, that is not dependent on the addition of exogenous fatty acids to the yeast culture and that possess an increased flux towards fatty acid biosynthesis and where high level production of FAEEs is obtained."

A fatty acid overproducing yeast cell will in turn overproduce fatty acids derived esters, e.g. FAEES (biodiesel). In this embodiment the inventors herein improve the supply of FAEE precursors. Thus an over-expression of the gene coding to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) in combination with an increased expression of fatty acid synthetases (FAS1 and FAS 2) yields an increased amount of Malonyl CoA and Fatty Acids, respectively.",

The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is highly regulated in S. cerevisiae: (1) Transcription of ACC1 is repressed by inositol and choline, as UASINO site was found in the promoter of ACC1 (Chirala, Zhong et al. 1994); (2) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity could be directly inactivated by Snf1p through phosphorylating (Shirra, Patton-Vogt et al. 2001).",

Furthermore, the inventors herein have found that under control of the constitutively expressed promoter, a release of ACC1 phosphorylation sites would provide a further increase towards FAEE biosynthetic flux. For example Ser659Ala and Ser1157Ala could be substituted (SEQ ID NO 16). Thus the inactivation by Snf1 could be avoided.

The supply of acetyl-CoA may become a shortage when the FA biosynthesis ability is severely reinforced. The step for biosynthesizing acetyl-CoA is catalyzed by acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, which is encoded by two genes, ACS1 and ACS2, in S. cerevisiae.

That's why it is important to improve the pool of fatty acids by down-regulating the fatty acid-consuming pathways. Most of the fatty acids are stored in the form of neutral lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters, which can constitute up to 70% of the total lipid content of the cell. In S. cerevisiae, TAG can be synthesized through two different pathways. As shown in FIG. 8, one is an acyl-CoA-dependent reaction that is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (encoded by DGA1 gene); another is phospholipids (PL) dependent reaction that is catalyzed by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (encoded by the LRO1 gene). Steryl esters are formed from sterols through the action of the enzyme acyl-CoA:sterol acyltransferase (ASAT) which is encoded by ARE1 and ARE2 genes in S. cerevisiae.",

In stationary phase, the quadruple disrupted strain has a 2.5-fold increase in fatty acids. Using Cre-loxP system, the four genes, DGA1, LRO1, ARE1 and ARE2, were disrupted sequentially. The mutant would decrease or abolish the amount of FA converted to neutral lipid production.",

The liberated fatty acids and free fatty acids could in turn be oxidized to generate energy by \u03b2-oxidation. S. cerevisiae has only one peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase, Pox1p, which is regarded as being the main enzymatic step controlling the flux through the \u03b2-oxidation. Knocking out the endogenous PDX1 gene to block fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation would be beneficial for the accumulation of lipid.",

Thus, a yeast cell with all non-essential fatty acid conversion reactions deleted or attenuated, specifically those related with R-oxidation, synthesis of phospholipids, triacylglycerol and sterol esters, would show a higher production of fatty acids and hence an over-production of FAEE. On the other hand, as reported by several authors a decrease in \u03b2-oxidation flux would increase lipid accumulation (Slocombe, Cornah et al. 2009; Steen, Kang et al. 2010)."

(2004) showed for the first time that low wax synthase activity could be detected in wild-type S. cerevisiae G175 using palmitoyl-CoA and 1-Hexadecanol as substrates. But no homologous sequence was detected in yeast.

It is obtained by expressing the atfA gene. This wax synthase may have sequence similarity with the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 (see attached Sequence Listing).

For example it could lead to the identification of WSs with higher specificity for ethanol. The selection of WSs with high activity for ethanol is of course, of crucial importance for designing an effective biodiesel producer as biodiesel is generally composed of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE). Said fatty acids have generally a chain-length from 14 to 20 carbon atoms, within the optimal operating range for acyl-CoAs. A recombinant yeast cell expressing e.g a M. hydrocarbonoclasticus is a good choice for designing a FAEEs producer because of its high preference for ethanol.",

These esters relates to liquid wax esters that can be used for biofuel, lubricants, cosmetics, linoleum, printing inks as well as products related thereto, and solid wax esters used for candles, polishes as well as products related thereto.

                                "Saccharomyce cerevisae is the preferred host for carrying out the invention, as it is a popular host in basic and applied research apart from being a good ethanol producer, a precursor of esters and specifically of fatty acid ethyl esters. Nevertheless as previously mentioned herein other fungal cells allowing the present invention are selected from the group consisting of other Saccharomyces species as well as other fungi such as, but not limited to, Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, Candida albicans, Aspergilli, Rhodotorula rubra, Torulopsis, Trichosporon cutaneum, Trichoderma reesei, Apiofrichum curvafum, Yarrowia lipolytica, Cryptococcus curvatus.",
                                "In S. cerevisae, fatty acids act as a feedback inhibitor of acetyl CoA carboxylase, and also as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation in response to increased fatty acid availability. On the other hand we know that the regulatory properties of fatty acids are mediated through their activation to Acyl CoA. This means that in S. cerevisiae, fatty acid biosynthesis is inhibited by its product, the acyl-CoA.",
                                "Acyl CoA binding protein (ACBP) can attenuate the inhibitory effect of Acyl CoA by binding long- and medium-chain acyl-CoA esters with very high affinity. Owing to the high affinity of ACBP for Acyl CoA, the intracellular free Acyl CoA concentration is predicted to be very low. It has been demonstrated that overexpression of Acb1p and bovine ACBP in S. cerevisiae increased the total acyl-CoA pool size. The inventors herein have developed a yeast cell in which ACBP (acyl CoA binding protein) is over-expressed so that to down-regulate the activity of enzymes involved in the lipid metabolism and in this specific case for deregulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Increased ACBP expression is translated in low free Acyl CoA levels and more fatty acid availability.",
                                "As previously explained, the present invention adopted a pESC derived plasmid as the expression vector. The plasmid pSP-GM2 shown in FIG. 4, can express two genes simultaneously. In this specific modification, Acb1 is also ligated to plasmid pSP-GM2 and under control of promoter PGK1 (S. Partow et al., 2010).",
                                "Over-expressing ACBP as used herein means altering the rate of transcription, Post-transcription, or translation of the gene encoding the protein as compared with the same rates in the yeast cell without modification.",
                                "Methods of testing for over-expression are well known in the art, for example transcribed RNA levels can be assessed using rtPCR, and protein levels can be assessed using SDS page gel analysis.",
                                "In a further preferred embodiment the invention teaches a system and a method in which a further increase in fatty acid production is obtained by down-regulating, attenuating, deleting or over-expressing additional genes encoding enzymes involved in the fatty acids synthesizing pathway, fatty acid consuming pathways, carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways or enzyme acting as wax ester transporters or a combination thereof. In this regard the genetically modified yeast cell of the present invention may include other modifications in addition to an over-expressed ACBP, but preferably it should contain genes encoding a combination of different wax synthases with high specificity for short-chain alcohols.",
                                "Basically, the genetic modifications may increase the level of enzymes involved in the different biosynthetic pathways, reduce feedback inhibition at different locations in the biosynthesis pathways, affect the availability of different substrates and cofactors used in said pathways, affect expression of genes coding those enzymes, etc.",

Shown in FIG. 11, the wax synthase and bacterial neo gene (Neo, G418 resistance gene) were fused together, and integrated into delta sequence of chromosome by yeast transformation. The copies of delta sequence occur in multiple places throughout the yeast genome, and, under the selection of increasing concentration of G418, clones with multiple copies of the inserted gene can be generated.

Using plasmid pSP-B2 as the template, the WS sequence with TEF1 promoter and CYC1 terminator could be amplified with primer 3 and primer 4.

The colonies selected from the plate with higher concentration of G418 should contain higher copy number of WS, and contribute to a higher biodiesel production. FIG. 13 shows the relationship of the concentration of biodiesel production and the concentration of G418.
