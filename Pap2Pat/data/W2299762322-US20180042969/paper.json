    "title": "Selenium Augments microRNA Directed Reprogramming of Fibroblasts to Cardiomyocytes via Nanog",
    "date": "2016-03-15",
    "abstract": "We have recently shown that a combination of microRNAs, miR combo, can directly reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo . However, direct reprogramming strategies are inefficient and slow. Moving towards the eventual goal of clinical application it is necessary to develop new methodologies to overcome these limitations. Here, we report the identification of a specific media composition, reprogramming media (RM), which augmented the effect of miR combo by 5\u201315-fold depending upon the cardiac marker tested. RM alone was sufficient to strongly induce cardiac gene and protein expression in neonatal tail-tip as well as cardiac fibroblasts. Expression of pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 was significantly enhanced by RM, with miR combo augmenting the effect further. Knockdown of Nanog by siRNA inhibited the effect of RM on cardiac gene expression. Removal of insulin-transferrin-selenium completely inhibited the effect of reprogramming media upon cardiac gene expression and the addition of selenium to standard culture media recapitulated the effects of RM. Moreover, selenium enhanced the reprogramming efficiency of miR combo.",

                        "We have previously shown that a combination of microRNAs, which we called miR combo (miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, miR-499), directly reprograms cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo35. In this study we sought to identify a method that would enhance the efficiency of microRNA directed reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro35.",
                        "Previous work in our laboratory has shown that a media composed of Advanced DMEM/F12, ascorbic acid and insulin-transferrin-selenium promotes the differentiation of Sca-1+ cardiac progenitors into cardiomyocyte-like cells9. On the basis that cardiac progenitors and fibroblasts have many surface markers in common we hypothesized that this media would augment miR combo direct reprogramming.",
                        "Neonatal cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with a negative control miR (negmiR) or miR combo. Cells were then cultured for 7 or 14 days in growth media (GM) or reprogramming media (RM). In-line with our previous findings, in standard growth media (GM) miR combo significantly induced the expression of a number of markers that are found in mature cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a). Reprogramming media (RM) significantly augmented the effect of miR combo for all of the cardiac markers tested with a fold increase of 2- to 20-fold (Fig. 1a). Similarly, in both the mock and negmiR transfected fibroblasts cardiac gene expression was similarly 2- to 10-fold higher in the RM treated group when compared to the GM treated group (Fig. 1a). Thus, RM was augmenting the effect of miR combo by increasing baseline cardiac gene expression. Changes in gene expression are not necessarily reflected in protein levels so we measured Cardiac Troponin-T and \u03b1-MHC protein expression by flow cytometry. After 14 days neonatal cardiac fibroblasts cultured in RM were found to have significantly higher levels of Cardiac Troponin-T and \u03b1-MHC protein when compared to the growth media treated group (Fig. 1b). Finally, we assessed the specificity of reprogramming media by measuring the expression of ectoderm, endoderm and vascular markers. Reprogramming media did not increase the expression of the endodermal markers Gata6 and Sox17 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Similarly the expression of ectodermal (Pax-2, Pax-6) and vascular markers (Pecam-1, Flk-1) were unaffected by reprogramming media (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1).",
                        "To eliminate the possibility that our results were due to the differentiation of cardiac progenitors within our cardiac fibroblast isolations we repeated our experiments with neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts. Neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were isolated and cultured in either fibroblast growth media (GM) or reprogramming media (RM). We first evaluated gene expression by qPCR. RM significantly increased the mRNA levels of Cardiac Troponin-I, an intermediate cardiomyocyte marker, at all time-points tested (Fig. 2a). Similarly, RM robustly stimulated expression of cardiomyocyte sodium (Scn5a) and calcium (Cacna1c) channels (Fig. 2a). We then determined whether the changes in cardiac gene expression were reflected at the protein level. Neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were cultured for 14 days in either GM or RM. Cells were stained with antibodies for cardiac markers and then analyzed by flow cytometry. RM increased the number of cells expressing \u03b1-sarcomeric actinin, \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin-T by greater than 5-fold, when compared to the GM treated group (Fig. 2b)."

                        "We then wished to determine the mechanism by which RM induced cardiac gene expression in neonatal fibroblasts. Flk-1 expression was not affected by RM suggesting that the neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were not adopting a cardiac progenitor cell fate (Fig. 3a). RM induced the expression of Hand2 and Tbx5, two early markers of commitment to the cardiac lineage, by 3- and 12-fold respectively (Fig. 3b). More dramatic effects were observed with pluripotency markers. Nanog mRNA levels in RM treated neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts reached >100-fold above that of cells cultured in GM by day 7 (Fig. 3c). Similarly, RM induced Oct4 levels ~40-fold, Sox2 levels by ~30-fold, and Klf4 levels by ~25-fold (Fig. 3c). GM had no effect on the expression of these pluripotency genes at any time point (Fig. 3c). We verified the gene expression experiments by flow cytometry. There were significantly higher percentages of Oct4 and SSEA-1 positive cells in neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts cultured in RM when compared to the GM treated group (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Our data suggested that RM was inducing neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts to become iPS cells. To investigate this further, we cultured neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts in GM or RM for 14 days and re-plated the cells onto a MEF feeder layer. These co-cultures were cultured in standard iPSC culture media to measure colony formation. Colony formation was observed with neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts cultured in RM but not GM (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We observed 1\u20133 colonies per 10,000 cells plated. These colonies tested positive for various iPS markers such as alkaline phosphatase (Supplementary Fig. 2b), Nanog (Supplementary Fig. 2c) and Oct4 (Supplementary Fig. 2c) however expansion was very limited indicating that the colonies lacked the proliferative capacity of typical iPS cells (data not shown).",
                        "As described above Nanog expression increased dramatically in neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts cultured in RM. Similarly, RM increased Nanog expression in neonatal cardiac fibroblasts (Fig. 3d). MiR combo had no effect on Nanog expression when cells were cultured in GM. However, miR combo significantly augmented the effect of RM upon Nanog expression (Fig. 3d).",
                        "Taking these results above into consideration we wished to determine if Nanog was responsible for the effect of RM upon cardiac gene expression. Neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were transfected with either a negative control or Nanog siRNA. Nanog knockdown was significant as determined by qPCR (Fig. 4a). Flk1 expression was not affected by Nanog siRNA (Fig. 4b). Knockdown of Nanog significantly inhibited the expression of the pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox2 (Fig. 4c). Moreover, Nanog knockdown significantly inhibited cardiac gene expression in neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts cultured in RM for all the markers tested (Fig. 4d)."

                        "We then wished to determine the active component of RM. Our reprogramming media (RM) differs from standard DMEM:F12 by the inclusion of several specialized components: AlbuMAX, insulin-transferrin-selenium, ascorbic acid, glutathione, ammonium metavanadate, Manganese chloride, and ethanolamine. Neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM:F12, RM, or RM lacking one of the aforementioned specialized components. Cardiac gene expression was assessed after 14 days by qPCR. Only the removal of insulin-transferrin-selenium completely inhibited the effect of RM upon cardiac gene expression (Fig. 5a). Importantly the addition of insulin-transferrin-selenium to DMEM:F12 induced Cardiac Troponin-I and Cacna1c expression (Fig. 5b). We then wished to determine which component of insulin-transferrin-selenium was promoting cardiac gene expression in fibroblasts. Neonatal tail-tip fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM:F12 or DMEM:F12 supplemented with insulin, transferrin, or selenium for 14 days and cardiac gene expression assessed by qPCR. Insulin and transferrin had no effect on cardiac gene expression (Fig. 5c). In contrast, selenium significantly increased cardiac gene expression (Fig. 5c). Moreover, the addition of selenium fully recapitulated the effects of insulin-transferrin-selenium (Fig. 5c). Finally, we wanted to determine if the addition of selenium enhanced the reprogramming efficiency of miR combo. To that end, neonatal cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with miR combo or the control negmiR. Standard growth medium was supplemented with selenium or equivalent volume of vehicle (water). After 14 days cardiac gene expression was determined by qPCR. In standard growth media miR combo significantly induced the expression of the cardiomyocyte markers cardiac troponin-I and Cacna1c (Fig. 5d). The addition of selenium to the growth media enhanced the effect of miR combo; expression of cardiac troponin-I and Cacna1c were enhanced by 10- and 4-fold respectively (Fig. 5d)."

                "Combinations of transcription factors7810 or microRNAs (miR combo)345 have successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts directly into cardiomyocytes. Both of these direct reprogramming methodologies give rise to improvements in cardiac function when delivered into the mouse heart following myocardial infarction3478. Despite these encouraging results direct reprogramming suffers from low efficiency which limits future clinical applications. Thus, there is a need to identify strategies that improve the efficiency of direct reprogramming. Our study shows that the addition of selenium improves the efficiency of direct reprogramming. Selenium is known to be important for cell proliferation11 and is essential for sustained ESC culture expansion12. The necessity of selenium for the maintenance of ESC cultures may partly explain the iPS-like colonies that form in response to RM. It has been known for a number of decades that selenium plays a beneficial role in human health13. This is attributed to the presence of selenium in a number of proteins, named selenoproteins, in the form of the amino acid selenocysteine13. Such selenoproteins are known to be important for the formation of muscle and normal heart function. MyoD, the master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, activates the Selenoprotein W gene14. Selenoprotein W subsequently promotes skeletal muscle differentiation by inhibiting TAZ binding to 14-3-3 protein15. Several selenoproteins have been shown to have extensive roles in the heart16. For example, ablation of GPx1 leads to increased infarct size following injury17 and cardiac tissue restricted ablation TrxR2 results in fatal dilated cardiomyopathy18. It is possible that such selenoproteins may be involved in the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into cardiac-like cells by RM and it is tempting to speculate as to what effect selenium would have upon direct reprogramming efficiency in vivo. Beyond selenium, other small molecules have been used to directly reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. The TGF\u03b2 pharmacological inhibitor SB431542 has been shown to augment transcription factor mediated reprogramming19. Furthermore, SB431542 in combination with the pharmacological inhibitors CHIR99021, forskolin and parnate reprogrammed tail-tip fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes in the presence of the transcription factor Oct420.",
                "Finally the relative ease with which fibroblasts, cardiac and tail-tip, can be forced to express cardiac genes suggests that these cells possess an inherent plasticity. Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. Using fate-mapping techniques cardiac fibroblasts were shown to adopt an endothelial cell phenotype after cardiac injury suggesting that adult fibroblasts possess an intrinsic plasticity21."
