                        "Heart failure is a disease affecting over 5 million people in the U.S., with 825,000 new cases each year (see, e.g., Go, A. S. et al. (2014) Circulation 129:e28-e292). The heart has low intrinsic regenerative ability and excessive fibrosis (i.e. formation of scar tissue) following a myocardial ischemic event results in significant impairment of tissue structure and function (see, e.g., Burridge, P. W. et al. (2012) Cell Stem Cell 10:16-28). Cardiac reprogramming, whereby cardiomyocytes are regenerated from cells inhabiting the scar tissue or from other cells derived from a subject, is an exciting field with a high degree of interest due to its therapeutic potential. For example, several groups have used transcription factors and small molecules to reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes (see, e.g., Ieda, M. et al. (2010) Cell 142:375-386; Qian, L. et al. (2012) Nature 485:593-598; Wang, H. et al. (2014) Cell Reports 6:951-960). Research has also shown that the use of a combination of microRNAs (miR-combo) can induce reprogramming (see, e.g., Jayawardena, T. M. et al. (2012) Circ. Res. 110:1465-1473). However, in spite of this progress, reprogramming efficiency remains low thereby limiting therapeutic potential. Therefore, new compositions and methods are needed to enhance cardiac reprogramming of cells to cardiomyocytes for therapeutic application following injury to cardiac tissue."

                        "Insulin-transferrin-selenium was found to reprogram fibroblast into heart muscle cells through what is called a pluripotent state. Thus a cell culture reprogramming media (RM) containing Insulin-transferrin-selenium was developed. The most distinguishing feature of this a media formulation is that that it induces change of one type of somatic cell into another type of somatic cell. Current technologies require manipulations with viruses or reagents that are very toxic. An important advantage of this media is that it avoids such toxic components and greatly simplifies the process of cell reprogramming. Changing somatic cells from one type into another is important clinically, e.g, to repair and regenerate injured, damaged, or scarred tissue.",
                        "Following a heart attack, muscle cells (one type of somatic cell) die in large numbers and they are not replaced. Instead fibroblasts (another type of somatic cell) invade the injury zone and through a number of processes impair cardiac function. If these fibroblasts could be converted into heart muscle this would improve heart function. The media and methods of the invention are useful to reprogram fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes which function and behave accordingly, e.g., beating heart cells.",
                        "There are two approaches to generate cardiomyocytes from cells such as fibroblasts. Indirect reprogramming involves an intermediary step, fibroblasts are first converted to a pluripotent state, e.g., induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and these iPS cells are then differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Direct reprogramming does not require an intermediary step and the fibroblasts are directly converted into cardiomyocytes. Distinct combinations of transcription factors or microRNAs have been identified that directly reprogram fibroblasts. For example, a combination of microRNAs, (\u201cmiR\u201d such as, but not limited to, miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, miR-499), have been shown to directly reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20140011281, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein). Protocols that promote the in vitro differentiation of iPS cells into neonatal-like cardiomocytes are well established and relatively efficient. In comparison, direct reprogramming in vitro, whether by microRNAs or transcription factors, can be inefficient and induces a relatively low level of cardiac gene expression in cells such as fibroblasts. The media and methods described herein include those that contain ITS and induce/promote fibroblast to cardiomyocyte reprogramming as well as media and methods that include both ITS and ascorbic acid, thereby promoting both indirect and direct reprogramming of the cells without the use of viruses or toxic reagents.",
                        "Any cell culture media is augments with ITS and/or ascorbic acid to promote somatic cell reprogramming Cell culture media formulations are well known in the art and any one of the standard media preparations below are modified according to the invention to reprogram cells to a cardiomyocyte phenotype. Such media formulations are commercially available from vendors such as Sigma, ATCC, and Life Technologies.",
                        "Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) was among the first widely used media and was formulated by Harry Eagle from a simpler basal medium (BME). EMEM contains balanced salt solution, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. It is formulated with a reduced sodium bicarbonate concentration (1500 ml/l) for use with 5% CO2. Since EMEM is a non-complex medium, it is generally fortified with additional supplements or higher levels of serum making it suitable for a wide range of mammalian cells.",
                        "Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) has almost twice the concentration of amino acids and four times the amount of vitamins as EMEM, as well as ferric nitrate, sodium pyruvate, and some supplementary amino acids. The original formulation contained 1,000 mg/L of glucose and was first reported for culturing embryonic mouse cells. A further variation with 4500 mg/L of glucose has been proved to be optimal for culture of various types of cells. DMEM is a basal medium and contains no proteins or growth promoting agents. Therefore, it requires supplementation to be a \u201ccomplete\u201d medium. It is most commonly supplemented with 5-10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). DMEM utilizes a sodium bicarbonate buffer system (3.7 g/L) and therefore requires artificial levels of CO2 to maintain the required pH. Powdered media is formulated without sodium bicarbonate because it tends to gas off in the powdered state. Powdered media requires the addition of 3.7 g/L of sodium bicarbonate upon dissolving it in water. DMEM was used initially for the culture of mouse embryonic stem cells. It has been found to be widely applicable in primary mouse and chicken cells, viral plaque formation and contact inhibition studies.",
                        "RPMI-1640 is a general purpose media with a broad range of applications for mammalian cells, especially hematopoietic cells. RPMI-1640 was developed at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) in Buffalo, N.Y. RPMI-1640 is a modification of McCoy's 5A and was developed for the long-term culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes. RPMI-1640 uses a bicarbonate buffering system and differs from the most mammalian cell culture media in its typical pH 8 formulation. RPMI-1640 supports the growth of a wide variety of cells in suspension and grown as monolayers. If properly supplemented with serum or an adequate serum replacement, RPMI-1640 has a wide range of applications for mammalian cells, including the culture of fresh human lymphocytes, fusion protocols, and growth of hybrid cells.",
                        "Ham's Nutrient Mixtures were originally developed to support the clonal outgrowth of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. There has been numerous modifications to the original formulation including Hams's F-12 medium, a more complex formulation than the original F-10 suitable for serum-free propagation. Mixtures were formulated for use with or without serum supplementation, depending on the type of cells being cultured. Ham's F-10 has been shown to support the growth of human diploid cells and white blood cells for chromosomal analysis. Ham's F-12 has been shown to support the growth of primary rat hepatocytes and rat prostate epithelial cells. Ham's F-12 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES provides more optimum buffering. Coon's modification of Ham's F-12 contains of almost two times the amount of amino acids and pyruvate as compared to F-12 and also includes ascorbic acid. It was developed for culturing hybrid cells produced by viral fusion.",
                        "DMEM/F12 is a mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 and is an extremely rich and complex medium. It supports the growth of a broad range of cell types in both serum and serum-free formulations. HEPES buffer is included in the formulation at a final concentration of 15 mM to compensate for the loss of buffering capacity incurred by eliminating serum.",
                        "Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) is a highly enriched synthetic media well suited for rapidly proliferating, high-density cell cultures. IMDM is a modification of DMEM containing selenium, and has additional amino acids, vitamins and inorganic salts as compared to DMEM. It has potassium nitrate instead of ferric nitrate and also contains HEPES and sodium pyruvate. It was formulated for the growth of lymphocytes and hybridomas. Studies have demonstrated that IMDM can support murine B lymphocytes, hemopoietic tissue from bone marrow, B cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, T lymphocytes, and a variety of hybrid cells.",
                        "The present invention is based, in part, on the observation that a media composed of a base cell culture media (such as, Advanced DMEM/F12), ascorbic acid, purified BSA, glutamine, and insulin-transferrin-selenium, henceforth referred to as \u201creprogramming media (RM),\u201d directly reprograms cells (such as fibroblasts) into cardiomyocytes as well as augments miR-directed reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. Using the instantly described compositions and methods, the efficiency of cell to cardiomyocyte reprogramming was increased by a surprising 5 to 15-fold depending upon the cardiac marker tested. RM induced the expression of cardiac genes in neonatal tail-tip and cardiac fibroblasts. Moreover, RM strongly induced the expression of the pluripotency markers Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, with miR combo augmenting the effect. Knockdown of Nanog by siRNA inhibited the effect of RM on cardiac gene expression. Removal of insulin-transferrin-selenium completely inhibited the effect of reprogramming media upon cardiac gene expression. Accordingly, the compositions and methods described herein have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of direct reprogramming of cells (such as fibroblasts, for example cardiac fibroblasts) to cardiomyocytes following injury to heart tissue brought on by conditions such as, but not limited to, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, or congenital cardiomyopathy.",

                                "The RM includes a base tissue culture media such as those described above. Tissue culture is generally understood as the growth of eukaryotic cells in vitro. Tissue culture media and processes are well known (see e.g., Helgason and Miller 2004 Basic Cell Culture Protocols, 3d Ed., Humana Press, ISBN-10 1588292843; Vunjak-Nokakovic and Freshney, ed. 2006 Culture of Cells for Tissue Engineering, Wiley-Liss, ISBN-10 0471629359; Freshney 2005 Culture of Animal Cells, 5th ed., Wiley-Liss, ISBN-10 0471453293.) Therefore, compositions and methods of the present invention can utilize any base tissue culture media capable of maintaining eukaryotic cells in culture for extended periods of time. In one embodiment, the base tissue culture media comprises Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 media (advanced-DMEM/F12), which is commercially available from Life Technologies. In another embodiment, the base tissue culture media is free of serum.",
                                "The RM may also contain purified bovine serum albumin (also known as BSA or \u201cFraction V\u201d) which is a serum albumin protein derived from cows commonly used in cell culture media. The RM can contain from about 0.05% to 0.4% w/v purified BSA, such as any of about 0.075%, 0.1%, 0.11%, 0.12%, 0.13%, 0.14%, 0.15%, 0.16%, 0.17%, 0.18%, 0.19%, 0.2%, 0.21%, 0.22%, 0.23%, 0.24%, 0.25%, 0.26%, 0.27%, 0.28%, 0.29%, 0.3%, 0.31%, 0.32%, 0.33%, 0.34%, 0.35%, 0.36%, 0.37%, 0.38%, 0.39%, 0.4%, or more, w/v purified BSA inclusive of all values falling within these percentages.",
                                "The RM further contains insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) as the active composition that mediates reprogramming. This reagent is commercially available through companies such as Gibco\u00ae. Prior to the invention, ITS was used as a basal medium supplement in order to reduce the amount of fetal bovine serum (FBS) needed to culture cells. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake, lipogenesis, intracellular transport, and the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. Transferrin is an iron carrier and it may also help to reduce toxic levels of oxygen radicals and peroxide. Selenium, (for example, in the form of sodium selenite), is a co-factor for glutathione peroxidase and other proteins, and is used as an antioxidant in media. The data described herein demonstrates that ITS alone in a culture media induces efficient reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes after only days or a week of culture. In some embodiments, the RM contains from about 0.1\u00d7 to 3\u00d7ITS, such as any of about 0.1\u00d7, 0.2\u00d7, 0.3\u00d7, 0.4\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, 0.6\u00d7, 0.7\u00d7, 0.8\u00d7, 0.9\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 1.1\u00d7, 1.2\u00d7, 1.3\u00d7, 1.4\u00d7, 1.5\u00d7, 1.6\u00d7, 1.7\u00d7, 1.8\u00d7, 1.9\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 2.1\u00d7, 2.2\u00d7, 2.3\u00d7, 2.4\u00d7, 2.5\u00d7, 2.6\u00d7, 2.7\u00d7, 2.8\u00d7, 2.9\u00d7, 3\u00d7, or more ITS, inclusive of values falling in between these numbers. ITS is frequently sold as a 100\u00d7 stock solution (see table below). Each 10 mL vial of Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium 100\u00d7 Supplement is sufficient for up to one liter of medium. In general, it is necessary to add 2-4% FBS to achieve optimal growth, although some adherent cultures may require less serum supplementation following initial adaptation. Store Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium supplemented medium in the dark at 2\u00b0 C. to 8\u00b0 C.",

                                "The methods disclosed herein provide a solution to the clinical problem of non-functional scar tissue in an organ such as the heart following injury or disease. The methods lead to direct reprogramming of differentiated cells such as fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocyte progenitors. Reprogramming is a process by which cells change phenotype, state of differentiation, or function. Accordingly, methods for promoting the conversion of a cell (such as a cardiofibroblast or dermal fibroblast) and/or cardiac fibrotic tissue into a cardiomyocyte and/or cardiomyocytic tissue are carried out by contacting fibrotic tissue (e.g., scar tissue) with any of the reprogramming media disclosed herein. Optionally, the cell and/or cardiac fibrotic tissue are also contacted with one or more microRNAs (such as any of those described above) and/or one or more reprogramming efficiency-enhancing molecules to enhance the efficiency of direct reprogramming Such molecules suitable for increasing the efficiency of conversion to cardiac myocytes include bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK)-1 inhibitor [e.g., 2-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz[h]-imidaz[4,5-f]isoquinolin-7-one, Pyridone 6, P6, DBI (420099 JAK Inhibitor I)], RG108, R(+) Bay K 8644, PS48, A83-01, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) such as valproic acid.",
                                "The fibrotic tissue to be treated is typically present in a heart diagnosed as having experienced cardiac myocardial infarction or other forms of cardiac disease, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and/or congenital cardiomyopathies. For example, the tissue can be contacted with reprogramming media and, optionally, viral (e.g., lentiviral) constructs expressing microRNAs after fibrosis has developed as a result of myocardial infarction or other cardiac disease process, e.g., days (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days after), weeks (1, 2, 4, 6, 8), months (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12), or even a year or more after the primary tissue insult. The fibrotic tissue is contacted in situ.",
                                "In the case in which the organ is treated in a subject, e.g., a human patient, the compositions (i.e. the reprogramming media, the miRNAs, and/or a reprogramming efficiency-enhancing molecule) are delivered locally or systemically, e.g., using intravenous administration or direct injection into cardiac tissue. Other delivery schemes include oral, nasal, intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, suppository, and sublingual administration. For example, the compositions are administered by direct injection into cardiac tissue. Other delivery modes are characterized by sustained release, controlled release, or delayed release. Administration of the compositions may be via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route.",
                                "The compositions are administered as pharmaceutically acceptable compositions, e.g., formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. For in vivo uses, the amounts and routes of administration will depend on numerous factors, including the amount of cardiofibroblast cells to be reprogrammed, severity of tissue damage, means of administration, and the like. In some embodiments, the reprogramming media is directly injected into the heart of the subject. In such embodiments, the amount needed may be about 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL mL to 10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 40 mL, 50 mL, 60 mL, 70 mL, 80 mL, 90 mL, 100 mL or more, inclusive of values falling in between these numbers. In other embodiments, the reprogramming media may be administered via lavage (e.g., soaking the heart of the subject). In such embodiments, the amount of reprogramming media needed may be about 1 L, 2 L, 3 L, 4 L, 5 L or more, inclusive of values falling in between these numbers. In general, dosage is from 0.01 \u03bcg to 100 g per kg of body weight, from 0.1 \u03bcg to 10 g per kg of body weight, from 1.0 \u03bcg to 1 g per kg of body weight, from 10.0 \u03bcg to 100 mg per kg of body weight, from 100 \u03bcg to 10 mg per kg of body weight, or from 1 mg to 5 mg per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. Examples of dosages based on small animal studies are in the range of 80 mg/kg for single or multiple dosages. However, it is expected with appropriate modification dosages 1-25 mg/kg for single to three repeated dosages will confer clinical benefit in human subjects.",

For example, the cells are dermal fibroblasts obtained from the skin of the patient to be treated. Alternatively, the cells are cardiac fibroblasts or epidermal keratinocytes. In other embodiments, the cells are derived from harvested scar tissue obtained from the heart of a subject who as recently experienced an adverse cardiac event such as, but not limited to, myocardial infarction or other forms of cardiac disease, such as ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, valvular heart disease, and/or congenital cardiomyopathies. The cells can also be adiopocytes or CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells. A skin or other tissue biopsy is obtained from a patient using known methods. To extract fibroblasts, the tissue is minced in a buffer, e.g, PBS, into small fragments and cultured in cell culture media. Fibroblasts grow out of the minced pieces of tissue. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells are made by performing a tissue, e.g., skin biopsy procedure on the patient; extracting human fibroblast cells from the skin biopsy tissue; and reprogramming patient-specific fibroblast cells into the pluripotent stem cell stage using ITS supplemented cell culture media or ITS+ ascorbic acid supplemented cell culture media. Thus in addition to ITS-driven reprogramming, the method can also include transfecting the cells with a microRNA or combination of microRNAs (such as any of those described herein) known to cause direct reprogramming of cells into cardiomyocytes (such as, but not limited to, one or more of miR-1, miR-133, miR-208, miR-499). The transfection can occur ex vivo or in vitro.",

In some embodiments, the reprogrammed cells are delivered locally or systemically, e.g., using intravenous administration or direct injection into cardiac tissue. In other embodiments, the cells are delivered to the heart (e.g., to an area of the heart characterized by scar or fibrotic tissue) via surgery, catheter, or intra-cardiac injection (e.g., through the chest wall).",

Optionally, the method can also include transfecting the cells with a microRNA or combination of microRNAs described above prior to, coincident with, or subsequent to contacting them with the RM. The method can further include contacting the cells with any of the reprogramming efficiency-enhancing molecules discussed above. The cells contemplated for use in any of the in vitro/ex vivo methods described herein can be any cell capable of direct reprogramming into a cardiomyocyte.

For in vitrolex vivo uses, the amount of media needed is that sufficient to culture the cell (such as a cardiofibroblast) and will be dependent on factors such as the number of cells being cultured, the size of culturing flask used, and the like and can be determined by one skilled in the art. As an example, not intended to be limiting in any way, suitable volumes may range from 1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, 4 mL, 5 mL to 10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 40 mL, 50 mL, 60 mL, 70 mL, 80 mL, 90 mL, 100 mL, or more, inclusive of values falling in between these numbers.
