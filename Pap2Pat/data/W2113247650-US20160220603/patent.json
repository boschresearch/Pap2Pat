                        "The eight subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to family C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and possess a large extracellular domain (ECD), seven transmembrane domains (TMD) and cytosolic C-terminal tail. The mGluRs are widely expressed in the central nervous system and play critical roles in regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Neyman, S., et al. (2008) The European journal of neuroscience 27:1345-1352). Extensive structural studies have revealed that the endogenous agonist, L-Glutamate (L-Glu), the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, binds at the hinge region of the ECD within the receptor's Venus Fly Trap (VFT) motif to activate the protein. This subsequently stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) and leads to accumulation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and an increase of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Lavreysen, H., et al. (2003) Molecular pharmacology 63:1082-1093; Lindsley, C. W., et al. (2004) Journal of medicinal chemistry 47:5825-5828; Kubo, Y., et al. (1998) Science 279:1722-1725).",
                        "In recent years, mGluRs have received increasing interest as potential drug targets for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and neurological diseases (Whang, P. G., et al. (2008) Orthopedics 31(10)) (FIG. 1). The ligands targeting mGluRs can be classified as orthosteric agonists and antagonists as well as allosteric modulators. Orthosteric agonists and antagonists induce and attenuate, respectively, the activity of the receptor by competitively binding to the L-Glu binding pocket. L-Quisqualate (L-Quis), the most potent agonist of mGluR1 reported to date (Yuan, K., et al. (2011) J Biol Chem 286:24776-24784; Chen, Y., et al. (2011) The Biochemical journal 435:711-722), has been speculated to share nearly the same binding pocket as L-Glu (Levant, J. A., et al. (1973) The New England journal of medicine 289:555-558; Sato, T., et al. (2003) J Biol Chem 278:4314-4321). In contrast, (S)-\u03b1-Methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (\u201c(s)-MCPG\u201d) is an analog of L-Glu and a non-selective competitive antagonist that has been shown to occupy the L-Glu binding pocket, thereby blocking the function of group I/II members in the mGluR family (Tsuchiya, D., et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 99:2660-2665). On the other hand, allosteric modulators bind to sites other than the orthosteric center to affect the activity of the receptor. The molecule (9H-xanthene-9-carbonyl) carbamic acid butyl ester (\u201cRo 67-4853\u201d) is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGluR1 that enhances the potency of L-Glu by interacting with the TMDs of the receptor. The molecule (\u2212)-ethyl (7E)-7-hydroxyimino-1,7a-dihydrocyclopropa[b]chromene-1a-carboxylate (\u201cCPCCOEt\u201d) is a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) that inhibits the activation of mGluR1 by L-Glu by specifically binding to a site residing at the third extracellular loop of mGluR1\u03b1 (Nagar, B., et al. (1996) Nature 380:360-364)."

Moreover, agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of group I mGluRs are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of other CNS disorders, including schizophrenia, cognitive deficits associated with chronic drug use, and deficits in extinction learning. Therefore, these activities can be enhanced by increasing extracellular Ca2+.",

The method can further involve administering to the subject a calcium agent for increasing or decreasing extracellular Ca2+ levels in an amount to modulate the activity of the orthosteric agonist, orthosteric antagonist, or allosteric modulator. Therefore, in some embodiments, the orthosteric agonist, orthosteric antagonist, or allosteric modulator may be administered at a dosage below its normally effective dosage (ED) if administered with the calcium agent.

                        "Like other members of the family of C GPCRs, such as the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), mGluR1\u03b1 senses [Ca2+]o using the extracellular domain (Huang, Y., et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48:388-398; Huang, Y., et al. (2007) J Biol Chem 282:19000-19010). mGluR1-mediated activation of Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 channels is modulated by [Ca2+]o in addition to L-Glu (Kubo, Y., et al. (1998) Science 279:1722-1725). Purkinje cells from mGluR1 knockout mice lose sensitivity to [Ca2+]o, with this sensitivity to [Ca2+]o being restored after mGluR1 was genetically reintroduced into the mice (Tabata, T., et al. (2002) Mol Cell Neurosci 20:56-68). There are sparse reports of [Ca2+]o affecting the action of various classes of compounds acting on mGluRs (Suzuki, Y., et al. (2004) J Biol Chem 279:35526-35534). However, it was not clear how [Ca2+]o is able to modulate the activity of mGluR1 or the actions of various mGluR1 ligands, and no Ca2+-binding sites have been identified in the 15 structures solved by X-ray crystallography to date.",
                        "Using a recently developed computational algorithm, a [Ca2+]o-binding site was identified within the hinge region of the ECD of mGluR1\u03b1, adjacent to the reported L-Glu-binding site (Wang, X., et al. (2009) Proteins 75:787-798; Wang, X., et al. (2010) Protein science: a publication of the Protein Society 19:1180-1190). It is comprised of D318, E325, D322, and the carboxylate side chain of the natural agonist, L-Glu. The carboxylate side chains of both L-Glu and D318 are involved in both L-Glu- and [Ca2+]o-binding. A mutagenesis study indicated that binding of L-Glu and Ca2+ to their distinct but partially-overlapping binding sites synergistically modulates mGluR1\u03b1-mediated activation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i signaling. Mutating the L-Glu-binding site completely abolished L-Glu signaling, while leaving its Ca2+ sensing capability largely intact. Mutating predicted Ca2+-binding residues not only abolished or significantly reduced the sensitivity of mGluR1\u03b1 to [Ca2+]o but also, in some cases, to L-Glu (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474).",
                        "The role of [Ca2+]o in modulating the actions of different orthosteric ligands acting on mGluR1\u03b1, including L-Quis, (s)-MCPG, was examined, as well as reciprocal interactions between Ca2+ and the mGluR1 allosteric modulators, Ro 67-4853 and CPCCOEt. Predicted Ca2+-binding site was found to be adjacent to the orthosteric agonist and antagonist interaction sites and to exhibit a good dynamic correlated motion with these sites as assessed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. These studies furthermore demonstrated that [Ca2+]o enhances [3H]-L-Quis binding to wild type mGluR1\u03b1 and consistently induces [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, these studies indicated that (s)-MCPG efficiently antagonizes both L-Glu- and [Ca2+]o-induced receptor activation at low concentrations, but that increasing the concentration of L-Glu or [Ca2+]o can overcome this inhibition. In addition, these studies demonstrated that Ro-674853 and CPCCOEt potentiate and inhibit responses to [Ca2+]o, respectively, and [Ca2+]o increases the potency of Ro-674853 but reduces the inhibition of mGluR1\u03b1 by CPCCOEt. Therefore, [Ca2+]o modulates the sensitivity of mGluR1\u03b1 to not only orthosteric agonists and antagonists but also allosteric modulators, likely by interacting with the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site in the ECD of the receptor.",
                        "Therefore, as disclosed herein, there is a Ca2+-binding site in the hinge region of group I mGluRs that is adjacent to the site where orthosteric agonist and antagonist drugs bind on the extracellular domain of the receptor. Moreover, extracellular Ca2+ enhances group I mGluR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ responses evoked by orthosteric agonists, and diminishes the inhibitory effect of mGluR orthosteric antagonists. In addition, selective positive and negative allosteric modulators of mGluR potentiate and inhibit responses to extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Therefore, binding of extracellular Ca2+ to the predicted Ca2+-binding site in the ECD of mGluR modulates not only glutamate-evoked signaling but also the actions of both orthosteric and allosteric drugs on mGluRs.",
                        "Orthosteric and Allosteric mGluR Modulators",
                        "To date, eight different mGluR receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized, and these receptors appear to have diverse neuroanatomical distributions as well as unique pharmacological and intracellular signaling properties. The group I family of mGluRs consists of mGluR1 and mGluR5 receptors, whereas the group II family consists of mGluR2 and mGluR3 and the group III family consists of mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8. The disclosed methods and compositions can involve the use of any orthosteric agonist or antagonist of mGluR that binds in the L-Glu binding pocket of a group I mGluR.",
                        "The methods and compositions can also be used with any allosteric modulators that affect the binding of L-Glu to a group I mGluR. Examples of agonists, antagonists, and allosteric regulators of mGluR1 and mGluR5 are set forth in Tables 1A and 1B.",
                        "Extracellular Calcium Modulators",
                        "The disclosed compositions and methods can involve the use of any agent, regimen, system, or process that can modulate the extracellular levels of calcium near group I mGluR receptors. In particular, the compositions and methods relate to calcium agents that modulate the extracellular levels of calcium in the central or peripheral nervous system, such as in the brain.",
                        "In some embodiments, calcium levels are raised by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 200%, or 300% above current levels. In some embodiments, calcium levels are decreased by at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, or 90%.",
                        "Calcium Supplement",
                        "The disclosed calcium agent can be any source of calcium that is capable of raising the free ionized calcium concentration in the plasma to at least 1.0 mmol/L (2.0 mEq/L) in the plasma of a subject. Calcium (Ca2+) must be present in a soluble form for efficient absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. This soluble form is generally Ca2+ ions, which are hydrated by solvent water or loosely complexed to anionic ligands in solution. Calcium absorption from gastrointestinal tract takes place by both active transport and passive diffusion. The active transport is saturable, stimulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and predominates in the duodenum and proximal jejunum; while passive transport is the principal mechanism for absorbing large loads of Ca2+ (which saturate the active process), and involves the distal jejunum and ileum which have longer transit times.",
                        "Many of the studies of Ca2+ absorption have employed a single oral dose, ranging from 250 mg up to 2000 mg. With a smaller dose, 15-500 mg of Ca2+, the fractional absorption varies inversely with the logarithm of the load size. With a larger load (>500 up to 2000 mg), the fractional absorption increases linearly with load size, reflecting a role of the passive transport over the active transport. Calcium absorption has also been modeled by fitting the amount absorbed to an equation with a hyperbolic term for the saturable process and a linear term for the nonsaturable process.",
                        "In some embodiments, the calcium agent can include elemental calcium, calcium salt, and complexed calcium supplements. In various embodiments, the calcium increasing agent is a calcium salt. In some embodiments, the calcium increasing agent can be elemental calcium or a calcium salt or complexed calcium that upon a single and/or multiple administration doses over a period of hours to days, days to weeks, or weeks to months, raises the plasma concentration of free ionized calcium to at least 1.0 mmol/L (2.0 mEq/L) in the subject.",
                        "Free ionized calcium is amenable to calculation once the concentration of total plasma calcium concentration is known. The total plasma calcium concentration consists of three fractions. Approximately 15 percent is bound to multiple organic and inorganic anions such as sulfate, phosphate, lactate, and citrate. About 40 percent is bound to albumin in a ratio of 0.8 mg/DI (0.2 mmol/L or 0.4 mEq/L) of calcium per 1.0 g/DI (10 g/L) of albumin. The remaining 45 percent circulates as physiologically active ionized (or free) calcium. The ionized calcium concentration is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone and vitamin D. The wide range in the normal total plasma calcium concentration is probably due to variations in the plasma concentration of albumin among normal healthy individuals and to variations in the state of hydration and arterial acid-base balance or increased blood concentrations of lactate, citrate and the like in subjects that can alter the albumin concentration and thus the free ionized calcium levels. The net effect is that measurement of the total plasma calcium concentration alone can be misleading, since these parameters can change affecting the ionized calcium fraction.",
                        "In some embodiments, the calcium agent can include calcium supplements. The disclosed compositions can also be formulated with one or more calcium supplements by providing sufficient calcium supplement in the composition to reach a predetermined elemental calcium amount for example, from about 100 mg to about 5000 mg, from 100 mg to about 2000 mg, from about 500 mg to about 1,000 mg in the composition.",
                        "Neurotransmitter or Amino Acid",
                        "In some embodiments, the calcium agent is a neurotransmitter or amino acid that affects sensitivity of the mGluR to calcium. In some embodiments, the calcium agent is a neurotransmitter that promotes calcium release from cellular calcium stores. For example, L-glutamate is a neurotransmitter that can bind with mGluRs to trigger the increase of IP3. IP3 further causes the release of CA2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).",
                        "Electric or Mechanical Stimulation",
                        "In some embodiments, the calcium agent is an electric or mechanical stimulation. Electrical or mechanical stimulation of neurons causes extracellular calcium to enter cells via channels in the plasma membrane (e.g. voltage gated calcium channel, ligand gated calcium channel). This can increase the average cytosolic calcium concentration from around 100 nM to around 1 \u03bcM.",
                        "Calcium Sensing",
                        "Methods and biosensors for measuring levels of extracellular calcium are known and described, for example, in WO 2012/054648 by Yang et al. and WO 2008/076365 by Yang et al, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties for these teachings. Therefore, in some embodiments, the disclosed methods further involve measuring extracellular Ca2+ levels and adjusting the levels of extracellular Ca2+ as described above to optimal levels suitable to enhance the activity of one or more group I mGluR orthosteric agonists, orthosteric antagonists, or allosteric modulators. Normal extracellular concentrations of calcium in the brain are in the range from 1.5-2.0 mM range (Jones, H. C., and R. F. Keep. 1987. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 383:441-453). In some embodiments, \u201coptimal levels\u201d of extracellular Ca2+ includes levels that are at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or 200% higher than physiological levels. In particular embodiments, \u201coptimal levels\u201d of extracellular Ca2+ includes levels that are at least 50% higher than physiological levels.",

Orthosteric agents therefore can compete with the neurotransmitter for binding at the primary site, and may be further classified as \u201ccompetitive\u201d agonists or antagonists. Agonists or antagonists which bind to and are active at a secondary, and in some cases a tertiary, receptor binding site, which are spatially distinct domains for which the endogenous neurotransmitter has very little or no affinity, are termed \u201callosteric\u201d ligands. These allosteric ligands are \u201cnon-competitive\u201d in that, even in high concentration, they will not displace the endogenous ligand by competing for the primary binding site. However, compounds which bind to an allosteric site in a receptor may mitigate, modify, attenuate, enhance, diminish, inhibit, or prohibit the binding of the endogenous neurotransmitter or other orthosteric ligand to the primary binding site. Alternatively compounds which bind to an allosteric site in a receptor may mitigate, modify, attenuate, enhance, diminish, inhibit, or prohibit the physiological function of the activated receptor which include, among others, ion flux regulation, signaling, phosphorylation, and recruitment of proteins. The potency of attraction of an agonist or antagonist, whether orthosteric or allosteric, to its binding site in the receptor, is determined by the sum of non-covalent attractive and repulsive chemical forces of the ligand for the binding site, and is referred to as \u201caffinity\u201d. A high affinity agonist or antagonist will bind to its respective site in the receptor at very low concentration, while much higher concentrations of low-affinity molecules are required before significant binding occurs. Agonists or antagonists with sufficient affinity to bind to an allosteric site will produce a dramatic change in the physiological function of an activated mGluR. Such agonists or antagonists are referred to herein as \u201callosteric modulators\u201d and may exhibit positive (enhanced physiological function) or negative (diminished physiological function) modulation.",

An initially 2 ns simulation was performed using NOE restraint during the equilibration in order to reorient the side chains residues in the Ca2+-binding site, but no restraints were used during the actual simulation. A total of four MD simulations were carried out for 50 ns each on wild type and three mutant mGluRs. The mutations were D318I, D322I, and E325I. First, the structures were minimized to achieve the lowest-energy conformation in each complex. The structures were then equilibrated for 2 ns, starting the MD simulations from the equilibrated structures. During the simulations, an integration time step of 0.002 ps was used to solve Newton's equation of motion. The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle Mesh Ewald method (Darden, T., et al. (1993) J. Chem.

As shown in FIG. 1B, the docked binding site of the agonist, L-Quis, corresponds well with the L-Glu-binding residues previously suggested by the crystal structure. The predicted Ca2+-binding site is also adjacent to the L-Quis pocket and interacts with L-Quis similarly to L-Glu (FIG. 1B). In the reported crystal structure of mGluR1 complexed with an orthosteric antagonist, (s)-MCPG (PDBID: 1ISS), (s)-MCPG interacts with Y74, W110, S165, T188, and K409 in lobe one (LB1) and D208, Y236 and D318 in lobe two (LB2) (FIG. 1B) (Tsuchiya, D., et al.

                                "Molecular Dynamics simulations were next performed to reveal any possible interaction between the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site and the orthosteric ligand-binding site. Residues involved in the [Ca2+]o-binding pocket, such as D318, D322, and E325, have strong correlated motions, as expected given their roles as [Ca2+]o-binding ligands. In addition, residues D318 and R323 residing within the same loop as the predicted Ca2+-binding site are also concurrently correlated. As shown in FIG. 2, most of the critical L-Glu-binding residues, including W110, S165, T188, D208, Y236, D318 and R323, are well correlated to the [Ca2+]o-binding site (D318, D322 and E325). However, mutations at the charged residues involved in [Ca2+]o-binding, such as D318I and E325I, markedly attenuate the correlation of the Ca2+-binding site with the L-Glu binding pocket. The Ca2+-binding site in mutant D318I only correlates with G293 and D208, and mutant D325I only correlates with Y236 and G293. The mutant D322I also exhibits impaired correlation between the [Ca2+]o-binding site and L-Glu-binding site, but to a lesser degree. As shown in Table 2, D318 in the [Ca2+]o-binding site still correlates with four residues in the L-Glu-binding pocket (FIG. 2). Similarly, residues that are involved in binding L-Quis and (s)-MCPG also correlate well with residues involved in the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site. Results from these analyses and previous studies on the effect of binding of [Ca2+]o to its site on L-Glu-mediated activation of mGluR1 indicate that [Ca2+]o regulates the effects of orthosteric ligands on mGluR1\u03b1.",

The residues with absolute correlation values greater than 0.3 are listed in this table. Of note, WT has five residues (shadowed not included because they resides at the same loop of [Ca2+]o-binding site and would have same motion) in the L-Glu-binding site that correlate with [Ca2+]o-binding 1, while there are only correlations between two residues in variants D318I and E325I, and four in D322I. Bolded residues are in the same loop as the [Ca2+]o-binding site, and they have same movements as the [Ca2+]o-binding site by default.",

                                "To test the effect of [Ca2+]o on the activation of mGluR1\u03b1 by the orthosteric agonist, L-Quis, a single cell fluorescence imaging assay was performed by measuring changes in [Ca2+]i using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with mGluR1\u03b1 and loaded with fura-2. To eliminate of the potential effect of trace L-Glu secreted from cells, experiments were conducted using continuous superfusion of cells. FIG. 3A-D show that L-Quis induces intracellular calcium responses mediated by mGluR1 in a similar manner to the activation of the receptor by L-Glu. [Ca2+]o behaves as a PAM of the L-Quis response and induces a leftward shift in the L-Quis CRC (concentration-response curve) for activation of mGluR1\u03b1 (FIG. 3A-D). In the absence of [Ca2+]o (Ca2+-free buffer with less than 2 \u03bcM calcium), the EC50 for the activation of mGluR1a by L-Quis is 12.8 nM. The addition of 1.8 mM [Ca2+]o reduces the EC50 of L-Quis to 2.8 nM (about 4.6 fold) (FIG. 3D, Table 3). This [Ca2+]o-mediated increase in the potency of L-Quis is similar to the effect of [Ca2+]o on the activation of mGluR1 by its natural agonist, L-Glu (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474).",
                                "To test whether this [Ca2+]o-mediated increase in the potency of L-Quis occurs via the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site in the ECD of the receptor, three mGluR1 variants were examined with mutations around the [Ca2+]o-binding site adjacent to the orthosteric binding site at the hinge region. The negatively charged side chain of E325 is important for [Ca2+]o-binding by mGluR1 and not directly involved in L-Glu-binding (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). Removal of the [Ca2+]o-binding ligand residue in the mGuR1 variant E325I reduces potency, increasing the EC50 from 12.6 to 20 nM in the absence of [Ca2+]o (FIG. 3D and Table 3). Importantly, this mutation significantly reduces the [Ca2+]o-mediated enhancement in potency for L-Quis from 4.6-fold to 1.6-fold in 1.8 mM [Ca2+]o, although both the potency and efficacy of L-Quis-mediated activation of the E325I mutant are still enhanced relative to WT mGluR1 (FIG. 3A-D). On the other hand, mutant D322I exhibits WT-like behavior in its response to L-Quis both in the absence and presence of [Ca2+]o (FIG. 3A-D, Table 3), consistent with D322 contributing to [Ca2+]o-binding to a lesser degree, with only its main chain oxygen serving as a ligand atom. WT-like modulation of the L-Glu response of D332I by Ca2+ was also observed (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). These [Ca2+]i imaging data suggest that [Ca2+]o plays a key role in modulating the activation of mGluR1\u03b1 by L-Quis, possibly via interaction of [Ca2+]o at the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site.",
                                "A direct binding assay with radioactive L-Quis ([3H]-L-Quis) was used to assess the impact of [Ca2+]o on the binding of [3H]-L-Quis to mGluR1\u03b1 or its variants with mutations at the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding ligand residues in the absence or presence of [Ca2+]o. L-Quis binds to the wild type receptor expressed in HEK293 with a KD in the range of 30 nM. L-Glu reduces L-Quis binding by competing for the similar orthosteric binding pocket (FIGS. 1B, 4B Insert). [Ca2+]o significantly enhances L-Quis-binding to the wild type receptor with an EC50 in the range of 0.3 mM (FIG. 3E, Table 3). Variant E325I, with removal of negative charge on the key [Ca2+]o-binding residue E325, abolishes L-Quis binding, and this effect is not influenced by the addition of L-Glu or [Ca2+]o (Kd>20 mM) (Table 3). On the other hand, variant D322I retains the binding properties of the wild type receptor for L-Quis suggesting its less essential role in L-Quis binding (FIG. 3E), which is consistent with its role in activation of increases in [Ca2+]i described earlier. Taken together, both the studies of [Ca2+]i responses and L-Quis-binding suggest that [Ca2+]o enhances the activation of mGluR1 by L-Quis by directly modulating binding of L-Quis to mGluR1 through an interaction with predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site 1 in the hinge region.",

                                "The effects of [Ca2+]o on various mGluR1 ligands acting by different mechanisms on mGluR1 were evaluated using L-Glu as the orthosteric agonist, since it is the physiological activator of the receptor in vivo. As shown in FIG. 4, (s)-MCPG induces a concentration-dependent decrease in the L-Glu-evoked [Ca2+]i response (FIG. 4A). A concentration of 0.5 mM (s)-MCPG elicits a parallel rightward shift in the L-Glu CRC, and increases the EC50 for L-Glu from 1.7 to 3.7 \u03bcM. This is consistent with the known action of MCPG as a competitive antagonist at the orthosteric L-Glu binding site.",
                                "Interestingly, FIG. 4A shows that MCPG also induces a concentration-dependent inhibition of the 5 mM [Ca2+]o\u2212 induced [Ca2+]i response, even in the absence of added L-Glu. Unlike the effect of MCPG on the response to L-Glu, MCPG does not completely block the response to [Ca2+]o. This is consistent with the hypothesis that MCPG inhibits the response to [Ca2+]o by acting at a site distinct from the one that allosterically regulates the response to [Ca2+]o. MCPG also induces a rightward shift in the [Ca2+]o CRC. The EC50 for [Ca2+]o increases by \u02dc1.7 fold (from 3.5 to 6.0 mM at 0 and 0.5 mM MCPG, respectively) (FIG. 4C, Table 4). The maximal response to [Ca2+]o was not affected by 0.5 mM MCPG. However, as noted above, higher concentrations of MCPG could not fully block the maximal effect of 5 mM [Ca2+]o.",

                                "CPCCOEt is known as a selective, non-competitive negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of mGluR1 that binds to residues T815 and A818 in the 7th TMD of the receptor (Harrington, P. E., et al. (2007) Current medicinal chemistry 14:3027-3034) (FIG. 1). As shown in FIG. 5A, the L-Glu-triggered [Ca2+]i response is significantly depressed in the presence of 5 and 40 \u03bcM CPCCOEt. In the presence of 40 \u03bcM CPCCOEt, the maximal response decreases to only about half of the control level, while the EC50 value increases from 1.7 to 10.1 \u03bcM (FIG. 5A, Table 5). To determine the effects of CPCCOEt on the activation of mGluR1\u03b1 by [Ca2+]o, the effect of CPCCOEt on [Ca2+]o-induced [Ca2+]i responses was examined. FIG. 5B reveals that CPCCOEt significantly inhibits the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of mGluR1\u03b1. In the presence of 5 \u03bcM CPCCOEt, the EC50 of mGluR1\u03b1 for [Ca2+]o was increased from 3.5 to 14.7 mM. A concentration of 40 \u03bcM CPCCOEt produces an even higher EC50 value of 28.7 mM (FIG. 5B, Table 5). The maximal response is also significantly decreased by 40 \u03bcM CPCCOEt, although the maximal response with 5 \u03bcM CPCCOEt is still comparable. This indicates that 30 mM [Ca2+]o cannot completely reverse the antagonism induced by CPCCOEt, and thus the inhibitory effects of CPCCOEt on the response of mGluR1\u03b1 to [Ca2+]o appears to be non-competitive (FIG. 5B, Table 5).",

(2003) Molecular pharmacology 63:1082-1093; Litschig, S., et al. (1999) Molecular pharmacology 55:453-461) (FIG. 1B), can also potentiate responses to [Ca2+]o. FIG. 6A shows that L-Glu-induced activation of WT mGluR1\u03b1 is enhanced by the addition of 10 or 100 nM Ro 67-4853 using single cell [Ca2+]i imaging. The effects of Ro 67-4853 on the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of wild type mGluR1\u03b1 in the absence of L-Glu was then examined. FIG. 6B shows that both 30 and 300 nM Ro 67-4853 enhanced the [Ca2+]i response induced by [Ca2+]o, reducing the EC50 values for [Ca2+]o from 3.5 mM to 2.1 and 0.7 mM, respectively. As with the effect of Ro 67-4853 on the response to L-Glu, the maximal response to [Ca2+]o is not changed by Ro 67-4853 (FIG. 6B and Table 6).",
                                "To further evaluate the effect of Ro 67-4853 on mGluR1\u03b1, HEK293 cells transiently expressing mGluR1\u03b1 were pre-incubated with 0.5 mM Ca2+ and 5 nM Ro 67-4853 for up to 10 minutes, and then the responses to multiple concentrations of Ro 67-4853 were tested. In the presence of 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o, Ro 67-4853 enhances L-Glu-induced mGluR1\u03b1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Increasing [Ca2+]o to 1.8 mM increases the potency of Ro 67-4853 for mGluR1\u03b1 (FIG. 6C). At the same time, the EC50 value decreases from 20.7 to 10.0 nM (FIG. 6C, Table 6). Interestingly, [Ca2+]i oscillations are observed when the cells are treated with Ro 67-4853. Similar to the Ca2+-sensing receptor, three different patterns of response are noted (Huang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:35919-35931). Most of the cells display a transient spike in [Ca2+]i. Some cells start oscillating after the first peak, while others have a transient peak and oscillations first appear a few minutes later. By analyzing the number of cells oscillating out of the total number of responsive cells, 1.8 mM [Ca2+]o significantly increases the number of oscillatory cells compared to the cells in 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o. The starting point of oscillation is also shifted leftward. This suggests that [Ca2+]o enhances the potency of Ro 67-4853 in activating mGluR1\u03b1.",
                                "To understand whether this modulation by [Ca2+]o f the action of this allosteric modulator acting via the TMDs is indeed a result of [Ca2+]o-binding to the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site 1 in the ECD (e.g., FIG. 1), studies were conducted using an mGluR variant with a key [Ca2+]o-binding ligand residue mutated, E325I. FIG. 1B shows that E325 is not directly involved in L-Glu-binding, and variant E325I is able to sense L-Glu and activate mGluR1\u03b1 in a manner similar to WT (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). FIG. 7A shows that addition of 30 \u03bcM L-Glu enhances the responsiveness of E325I to Ro 67-4853. Of note, FIG. 7B shows that E325I responds to 10 \u03bcM Ro 67-4853 in the absence of L-Glu in [Ca2+]o-free saline. Increasing [Ca2+]o from 0 to 5.0 mM does not affect the sensitivity of E325I to Ro 67-4853, but elevating [Ca2+]o increases the responses of WT mGluR1\u03b1 to 300 nM Ro 67-4853 (FIG. 7B). This suggests mutating the Ca2+ binding site (E325I) eliminates the Ca2+ effect on Ro 67-4853, but not WT mGluR1\u03b1. To determine if the receptors were saturated by Ro 67-4853, higher concentrations of the PAM were applied to both WT mGluR1 and E325I. As shown in FIG. 7B, higher concentrations of Ro 67-4853 increase the responses of both WT mGluR1 and E325I. This result suggests that [Ca2+]o-binding at its predicted site in the hinge region is essential for the positive allosteric action of this modulator.",
                                "Discussion",
                                "As disclosed herein, [Ca2+] has significant modulating effects on the actions of various orthosteric and allosteric ligands on mGuR1a, as assessed using a functional readout (i.e., [Ca2+]i responses) in receptor-transfected HEK293 cells. [Ca2+]o exerted several different effects on the compounds studied here, including the orthosteric agonist, L-Quis, the orthosteric antagonist, MCPG, and allosteric modulators, e.g., the PAM Ro 67-4853 and the NAM CPCCOEt.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 1, the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site partially overlaps the predicted orthosteric binding site for the agonist, L-Quis, and the antagonist, MCPG. [Ca2+]o affects [L-Glu]o-induced activation of the receptor. Consistent with this, activation of mGluR1\u03b1 by L-Quis was enhanced by [Ca2+]o in a similar manner. Through binding to the Ca2+ binding site on ECD-mGluR1, [Ca2+]o was capable of inducing the hydrolysis of PIP2, thus increasing IP3 and Ca2+ release from ER (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). [Ca2+]o was shown to synergistically activate mGluR1\u03b1 with L-Glu (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). However, activation of GPCRs also induces Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ entry channels. By utilizing Gd3+, an inhibitor of these Ca2+ channels, it was noted that mGluR1\u03b1 still could induce a [Ca2+]i increase. But comparing this to the Ca2+-induced response curve, the Gd3+ response brought the curve to the baseline. This suggests that Ca2+ release from the ER predominantly induces a transient peak, while Ca2+ influx elevates the plateau portion of the response. Increasing [Ca2+]o enhanced L-Quis binding to HEK293 cells over-expressing mGluR1\u03b1, while the mutant E325I abolished this effect of [Ca2+]o on the activation of mGluR1 (FIG. 3). Moreover, a clear difference in L-Quis and L-Glu binding was observed in the presence of very low [Ca2+]o. Using purified ECD of mGluR1\u03b1, Jingami et al. reported that [Ca2+]o enhances the increase in Trp fluorescence induced by L-Quis and L-Glu (Suzuki, Y., et al. (2004) J Biol Chem 279:35526-35534), although [Ca2+]o was reported to have no effect on L-Quis binding (Selkirk, J. V., et al. (2001) Neuropharmacology 40:645-656). Nash et al. also observed that [Ca2+]o produces a higher plateau [Ca2+]i response and greater IP3 accumulation in CHO cells mediated by mGluR1\u03b1 (Nash, M. S., et al. (2001) J Biol Chem 276:19286-19293), although the transient increase in [Ca2+]i was not affected. Thus, the disclosed observation that [Ca2+]o enhanced both L-Quis-induced [Ca2+]i responses and L-Quis binding to the receptor has a physiological implication similar to the modulation by [Ca2+]o of the action of L-Glu on mGluR1\u03b1. FIG. 1 shows that the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site is located adjacent to the (s)-MCPG binding pocket in mGluR1 in the X-ray structure (PDBID: 1ISS), which is in the hinge region of the ECD and occupies most of the residues involved in L-Glu-binding (Tsuchiya, D., et al. (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 99:2660-2665). The effects of gradually increasing concentrations of the orthosteric antagonist, (s)-MCPG, was tested on [Ca2+]o-induced signaling by mGluR1\u03b1. As shown in FIG. 4, (s)-MCPG reduced the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of mGluR1\u03b1 (FIGS. 4A and C). Increases in the concentrations of either [Ca2+]o or L-Glu overcame the inhibition induced by (s)-MCPG (FIG. 4). It is interesting to note that (s)-MCPG could not completely block the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of mGluR1 (FIG. 4C). [Ca2+]o-induced responses mediated by mGluR1\u03b1 were found to be only partially antagonized by (s)-MCPG (Kubo, Y., et al. (1998) Science 279:1722-1725). (s)-MCPG, was shown to have a capacity to completely inhibit L-Glu-potentiated Ca2+-activated Cl\u2212 currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes transiently expressing mGluR1 (Kubo, Y., et al. (1998) Science 279:1722-1725). These data indicate that [Ca2+]o modulates the effects of orthosteric ligands on mGluR.",
                                "The observed [Ca2+]o-modulated orthosteric effect is likely dependent on communication of the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site with the adjacent-binding site for orthosteric agonists and antagonists. The L-Quis binding pocket predicted here using AutoDock-Vina overlaps extensively with the L-Glu-binding pocket in the reported crystal structure (Table 7). The sidechain of D318 is involved in both [Ca2+]o- and agonist-binding. Mutation D318I abrogates both the sensitivity to [Ca2+]o and responsiveness to L-Glu (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). In this study, it also completely eliminated L-Quis-mediated activation of mGluR1 (FIG. 3E). Consistently, mutants T188A, D208A, Y236A and D318A abolished the sensitivity of the receptor to both L-Quis and L-Glu, while the mutants R78E and R78L exhibited clearly impaired L-Quis binding (Levant, J. A., et al. (1973) The New England journal of medicine 289:555-558; Sato, T., et al. (2003) The Journal of biological chemistry 278:4314-4321). The key residue E325 is involved in [Ca2+]o-binding, and the mutant, E325I, indeed significantly impaired both the [Ca2+]o and L-Glu sensitivity of the receptor (FIG. 3). On the other hand, variant D322I produced less reduction of the modulatory effects of [Ca2+]o on both L-Quis and L-Glu agonist action and is consistent with its lesser role in [Ca2+]o-binding with a contribution of only a main chain ligand atom (FIG. 1).",
                                "The observed effect of [Ca2+]o on responses to orthosteric agonists and antagonists of mGluR1 is consistent with Molecular Dynamics studies performed here on the correlated motions of the hinge region in the ECD of mGluR (FIG. 2, Table 2). A strong correlation among residues in the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site and residues involved in the orthosteric binding sites shared by L-Glu, L-Quis and MGPG were observed. Interestingly, mutation of the [Ca2+]o-binding site largely removed this correlation. FIG. 1A shows that the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site at the hinge region is conserved in the group I mGluRs, e.g., mGluR1 and mGluR5 (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474), calcium-sensing receptor and T1R3, a taste receptor for [Ca2+]o, (Dorr, P., et al. (2005) Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 49:4721-4732). In our previous study, [Ca2+]o exhibits synergy with L-Glu in activating mGluR1\u03b1 (Jiang, Y., et al. (2010) J Biol Chem 285:33463-33474). The effect of [Ca2+]o in modulating orthosteric ligands that act on mGluR via communication at the hinge region of the ECD. Binding of L-Phe and other amino acids to a site in the hinge region of the CaSR likely communicates with the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site at the hinge region to increase the sensitivity of the receptor to [Ca2+]o (Huang, Y., et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48:388-398; Huang, Y., et al. (2007) J Biol Chem 282:19000-19010; Conigrave, A. D., et al. (2007) The Journal of nutrition 137:1524S-1527S; discussion 1548S; Zhang, Z., et al. (2002) J Biol Chem 277:33727-33735). In recent years, increasing numbers of family C GPCRs, have been found to exhibit synergistic modulation of the primary orthosteric agonist by allosteric modulators. Sweet enhancers binding to the hinge region of the human taste receptor are known to stabilize the active form of the receptor, thus leading to altered perception of sweet taste, while IMP and L-Glu also synergistically activate the umami taste receptor (Zhang, F., et al. (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 107:4752-4757; Zhang, F., et al. (2008) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 105:20930-20934). It is also interesting to note that a suggested allosteric ligand acting at the ECD domain of mGluR is located at the hinge region (Acher, F. C., et al. (2011) Neuropharmacology 60:102-107; Ogawa, H., et al. (2010) Protein science: a publication of the Protein Society 19:544-557). Thus, the disclosed evidence has strong implications for the role of the hinge region of the ECD in modulating action of small molecule ligands on family C GPCRs.",
                                "As for allosteric modulators targeting the TMDs, the binding sites of positive and negative modulators of mGluR1\u03b1 are distinct (Hemstapat, K., et al. (2006) Molecular pharmacology 70:616-626). These allosteric modulators effectively modulate receptor activation by L-Glu, but little is known about the effects of the endogenous mineral ion, Ca2+, on these modulators. In this study, the effects of [Ca2+]o on CPCCOEt (NAM) and Ro 67-4853 (PAM) were further assessed.",
                                "The non-competitive NAM, CPCCOEt, is known to inhibit the L-Glu response by binding to T815 and A818 on the 7th TMD) (Rodriguez, A. L., et al. (2005) Molecular pharmacology 68:1793-1802; Brauner-Osborne, H., et al. (1999) Neuroreport 10:3923-3925). Our data shown in FIG. 5 support the contention that CPCCOEt, acting as a non-competitive inhibitor, also can diminish the [Ca2+]i response of mGluR1\u03b1. Interestingly, increasing [Ca2+]o restored [Ca2+]o sensitivity of the receptor. CPCCOEt not only inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells, but also reverses morphine tolerance (Haas, H. S., et al. (2007) The Oncol Rep 17:1399-1404; Smith, F. L., et al. (2004) Eur J Pharmacol 492:137-142). Thus, the findings in this study indicate that a drug targeting the [Ca2+]o-binding site in mGluR1 has the potential to tune the therapeutic effect of CPCCOEt on melanoma or addiction. V757 in the TMD was revealed to be critical to the activation of mGluR1 by the PAMs (Nemeth, E. F., et al. (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95:4040-4045; Hemstapat, K., et al. (2006) Molecular pharmacology 70:616-626). By analyzing the [Ca2+]i transients and oscillations observed here, [Ca2+]o not only reduced the concentration of Ro 67-4853 required to initiate [Ca2+]i oscillations, but also decreased the EC50 value and increased the maximal responses of HEK293 cells expressing mGluR1 (FIG. 6 and Table 6). In the presence of Ro 67-4853, the [Ca2+]o sensitivity of mGluR1\u03b1 was also enhanced, indicating an allosteric interaction between the [Ca2+]o-binding site and the site for Ro 67-4583. Interestingly, Ro 67-4853 only enhanced activation of mGluR1\u03b1 by physiological [Ca2+]o concentrations, while further increases in [Ca2+]o abolished the Ro 67-4853 effect. This indicates that a change in [Ca2+]o within the physiological range could serve as a PAM, similar to Ro 67-4853, and suggests that [Ca2+]o-induced enhancement of the potency of Ro 67-4853 may activate mGluR1 via the TMDs, and that the activation of the TMDs could enhance the sensitivity of the receptor to agonist. Since site-directed mutagenesis suggests that Ro 67-4853 along with the other PAMs, Ro 01-6128, and Ro 67-7476, likely share the same binding pocket involving V757. [Ca2+]o could potentially enhance the potencies of other members of the Ro and VU series.",
                                "The observed modulation of the effects of PAM and NAM by [Ca2+]o can be explained by the integrated action of the ECD domain with the TMDs of the receptor. This is supported by studies using a mutation of a key [Ca2+]o-binding ligand residue, E325I, at the predicted [Ca2+]o-binding site adjacent to the L-Glu-binding site. Variant E325I markedly reduces the modulation of the action of Ro67-4853 by [Ca2+]o (FIG. 7). PAMs binding to the TMDs have been shown to enhance L-Quis binding to mGluR1\u03b1 (Nemeth, E. F., et al. (1998) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 95:4040-4045). It is possible that the incomplete reduction in the inhibitory effect of MCPG by [Ca2+]o is due to an additional synergistic effect involving the TMD region of the receptor. By tagging the FRET pair YFP/CFP to the two intracellular loops 2 (i2) of the dimeric mGluR1\u03b1, Muto et al. observed that the re-arrangement of the TMD induced by L-Glu was reversed by (s)-MCPG (Tateyama, M., et al. (2004) Nat Struct Mol Biol 11:637-642). Such an integrated effect of the TMDs with the ECD region is further supported by studies of mGluRs with deletions of the VFT. It was found that PAMs not only potentiate the action of agonists on the full-length receptors, but sometimes can display strong agonist activity on VFT truncated receptors (El Moustaine, D., et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 109:16342-16347; Goudet, C., et al. (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 101:378-383). The VFTs of the ECDs are not only responsible for agonist-induced activation, but also prevent PAMs from activating the full-length receptor (El Moustaine, D., et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 109:16342-16347; Goudet, C., et al. (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 101:378-383). Taken together, this study reveals that [Ca2+]o-binding at the hinge region is likely to be responsible for its capacity to modulate action of other allosteric modulators. [Ca2+]o at physiological levels (1.8 mM) enhanced the potency of Ro 67-4853 in modulating mGluR1\u03b1, while increasing [Ca2+]o diminished the inhibitory effects of CPCCOEt (FIGS. 5-7, Tables 5-6). Over the past decade, many new PAMs and NAMs for various receptors have been developed, and the potential exists for developing allosteric modulators with greater subtype specificity than is possible for orthosteric agonists (Wang, L., et al. (2009) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 331:340-348). The co-activation induced by endogenous agonists and PAMs binding to the receptors' hinge regions could be a common feature of family C GPCRs. These data provide further insight into the modulation of mGluR1\u03b1 by [Ca2+]o and suggest that [Ca2+]o has the potential to modulate the profile of a variety of agents acting on mGluR1\u03b1, including agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators.",

After the cells reached 90% confluence, they were loaded by incubation with 4 \u03bcM Fura-2 AM in 20 mM HEPES, containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1% glucose, and 1% BSA (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. and then washed once with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1% glucose, and 1% BSA (bath buffer). The coverslips with transfected, Fura-2-loaded HEK293 cells were placed diagonally in 3-ml quartz cuvettes containing bath buffer. The fluorescence spectra at 510 nm were measured during stepwise increases in [Ca2+]o with alternating excitation at 340 or 380 nm. The ratio of the intensities of the emitted light at 510 nm when excited at 340 or 380 nm was used to monitor changes in [Ca2+]i. mCherry was genetically fused into mGluR1 pcDNA. so cells have fluorescent intensity at 550 nm was selected for further analysis.",

                                "mGluR1 can not only be activated by glutamate but also by calcium. Extracellular calcium can enhance glutamate induced intracellular calcium release in mGluR1 transfected HEK293 cell (FIGS. 18 and 19). Glutamate and extracellular calcium together will induce intracellular calcium oscillation (FIG. 20 and FIG. 21). 0 mM calcium was first used to incubate mGluR1 transfected HEK293 cells. The cells were treated by different concentration of glutamate (1.7 uM/17 uM), causing corresponding transient peaks. After peaks return to baseline, 0 mM calcium was further applied to wash away the remaining buffer. And then 3 mM/6 mM calcium were used to trigger the activation of mGluR1, no response was observed. Again, 0 mM calcium was used to wash away the reaming buffer, and finally the cells were treated by glutamate and calcium (1.7 uM glutamate with 3 mM calcium, 17 uM with 6 mM calcium). More cells response and more intracellular calcium was released, meanwhile calcium oscillation was observed (FIGS. 20 and 21). As shown in FIG. 21, calcium oscillation which triggered by Ringer buffer with 17 uM glutamate and 6 mM calcium can last for 1 h. Calcium oscillation frequency is faster and peak amplitude is larger by higher concentration of glutamate and extracellular calcium.",
