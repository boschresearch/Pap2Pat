    "abstract": "The invention relates to inhibitory nucleotide signal sequences or \u201cINS\u201d sequences in the genomes of lentiviruses. In particular the invention relates to the AGG motif present in all viral genomes. The AGG motif may have an inhibitory effect on a virus, for example by reducing the levels of, or maintaining low steady-state levels of, viral RNAs in host cells, and inducing and/or maintaining in viral latency. In one aspect, the invention provides vaccines that contain, or are produced from, viral nucleic acids in which the AGG sequences have been mutated. In another aspect, the invention provides methods and compositions for affecting the function of the AGG motif, and methods for identifying other INS sequences in viral genomes.",

                        "Lentiviruses belong to the Retrovirus family of viruses. The term \u201clenti\u201d is Latin for \u201cslow\u201d. Lentiviruses are characterized by having a long incubation period and the ability to infect neighboring cells directly without having to form extracellular particles. Their slow turnover, coupled with their ability to remain intracellular for long periods of time, make lentiviruses particularly adept at evading the immune response in infected subjects. Lentiviruses include immunodeficiency viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and equine infectious anemia viruses (EIAV). Lentivirus infection can cause serious illness, and, if left untreated, can be fatal. In recent years several anti-retroviral drugs and drug cocktails that reduce viral load and ameliorate the symptoms of HIV infection have been developed. However, despite their successes, these drugs generally fail to eradicate the viral infection altogether. Instead the virus persists, often in a latent state, in infected subjects. There have also been multiple attempts to generate vaccines against lentiviral diseases such as HIV. However, to date, no vaccine is commercially available. Thus, there exists a need in the art to develop new drugs and vaccines against lentiviruses such as HIV."

                                "For example, the HIV genome encodes the pr55 GAG protein, which can be cleaved by a viral protease into p17MA, p24CA, p7 and p6 proteins that make up the core of the virus. The Pr160 GAG-POL precursor protein produces a polymerase poly-protein that is made by translational frame shifting and is subsequently cleaved into a reverse transcriptase (RT), RNAase H, a protease (PR) and an integrase (IN). The Gp160 envelope protein is cleaved by a cellular protease into a Gp120 protein (ENV) that attaches the virus to the CD-4 receptor and the co-receptor and a Gp41 trans-membrane protein that fuses the viral envelope into the host cell membrane. These are the major structural proteins and enzymes of the HIV particle. Two additional proteins, Tat and Rev, regulate the transcription of the integrated provirus (Tat) and the transport of unspliced mRNAs (GAG-POL and viral genomic RNA) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Rev). These activities regulate the expression of viral genes and the temporal events during the replication cycle. Four accessory proteins: Vpu, Vif, Vpr and NO are adaptors that form complexes with cellular proteins and enhance infectious virus production in vivo, but have more minimal phenotypes in some cell cultures. All of these HIV proteins are within the scope of the invention.",
                                "The HIV virus attaches to T-cells and monocytes using its gp120 ENV protein, which binds to the CD-4 protein and co-receptors at the cell surface. T-cells express the cytokine receptor CXCR4, monocytes express the CCR5 co-receptor, and peripheral blood lymphocytes express both. Genetic alterations in the ENV protein produce monocyte tropic viruses (R5 viruses), T-cell tropic viruses (X4 viruses) and dual tropic viruses. The co-receptor is essential for ENV attachment and Gp41 fusion. People who lack a normal HIV co-receptor, for example because they carry the CCR5/delta 32 polymorphism, are almost completely resistant to HIV infection. (See, for example, Deng et al., Nature (1996) Vol. 381, p 661-6 and Samson et al., Nature, (1996) Vol. 382 p 722-5). Drugs that block the CCR5 co-receptor are now in clinical trials.",
                                "After fusion of the HIV virus with the cell, the virus core particle copies the viral RNA into a DNA copy using reverse transcriptase (RT) and the particle moves to the nucleus where it integrates the viral DNA into the cellular genome using integrase (IN). The long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA sequences contain a number of transcription factor binding sites that are essential to produce viral mRNAs from the incorporated DNA. In addition to a TATA element, there are two NF kappa b sites and three Sp-1 sites in the LTR which are recognized by cellular transcription factors. In addition sites for LEF, ETS and USF transcription factors are also present. These cellular transcription factors help to initiate transcription, but this occurs at a very low level. After TAT is produced, it binds to a cellular protein (cyclin T1) and the TAT-cycT1 complex then binds to an RNA loop structure (called TAR) in the viral mRNA. The TAT-cycT1 complex next binds the CDK9 protein kinase, which phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal end of one of the subunits of RNA polymerase-II. This is required for the efficient initiation of viral RNA transcription (which increases by 100 fold). Over 30 different viral RNA molecules are produced by these events. They fall into three categories: (1) unspliced RNAs that are used to make GAG, POL and the intact viral genomes, (2) partially-spliced RNAs of about 5.0 Kb in size, that are employed to make ENV, Vif, Vpu, and Vpr proteins, and (3) small, spliced RNAs (1.7-2.0 Kb) that are translated into REV, TAT and Nef. The transport of these RNAs out of the nucleus is most efficient for the fully spliced mRNAs. Thus, early after infection, only TAT, REV and NEF are made efficiently. TAT binding to TAR then increases the rate of transcription by 100 fold. The larger, unspliced or poorly spliced mRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm more efficiently only after the REV protein is made and binds to the Rev-responsive element (RRE) in the ENV gene. In this way, the synthesis of TAT and REV regulate timing of the viral life cycle.",
                                "In addition to TAT, there is a second set of signals in the HIV genome that reduce the steady state levels of viral RNA in cells. These are referred to as inhibitory nucleotide signal sequences (INS sequences). Putative INS-containing regions have been identified previously in the gag/pol regions of the HIV genome (see Schneider et al., Journal of Virology, (1997), Vol. 71, p. 4892-4903). In the prior study by Schneider et al. the region containing putative INS sequences was mutated to eliminate AUUUA pentanucleotides and to decrease AU content without altering the coding capacity of the region. It was found that these mutations resulted in an increase in the level of HIV RNA by up to 70-130 fold. With the INS sequences mutated and in the presence of a functional REV, the increase in HIV RNA in an infected cell was 160 fold higher than without these two distinct functions.",
                                "It is believed that the HIV virus gains an advantage by having a low steady state level of viral RNA. It has been proposed that a virus that replicates rapidly and kills the cell rapidly produces less virus per-cell than one that employs a slower cycle. Indeed, rapid efficient virus production and cell killing, as is observed with polio viruses for example, often leads to complete immune clearance of the virus and immunity to subsequent infections. In contrast, viruses which remain intracellular for prolonged periods are able to evade, or at least reduce the effectiveness of, the immune response against them.",
                                "Although mutations in the putative INS-containing region of the gag/pol genes are additive, the sequence(s) of the INS have not been previously defined (Schneider et al.). The INS-containing region(s) acts to lower the steady state levels of viral RNA in an infected cell. At least three possible mechanisms exists including (1) a lowered rate of transcription, (2) an increased rate of RNA degradation of HIV RNA, (3) a lowered rate of transport of HIV RNA out of the nucleus (Schneider et al.)",
                                "Poor immune response to Env and Gag are a fundamental problem in the effort to create a vaccine for HIV-1. For a DNA vaccine, immune response is correlated with expression level, so an increase in expression of these ORFs could alleviate a significant road block to the construction of a viable vaccine. The large mRNAs from HIV have processing problems and are not efficiently exported from the nucleus, presumably due to a set of protein binding sites encoded in their RNA. Identifying and removing the signal which causes the nuclear confinement may significantly increase expression levels of these ORFs and improve the immune response.",
                                "The genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contains nine open reading frames (ORFs), all of which are expressed from a single promoter through alternative splicing. The splice forms for the six ORFs Gag, Pol, Env, Vpu, Vif, and Vpr, along with the full length mRNA, contain REV response elements (RREs) encoded in their RNA. In the absence of the REV protein, these six ORFs are poorly expressed. The remaining three ORFs, Tat, Rev, and Nef, are expressed efficiently independent of the REV protein.",
                                "The mRNAs which contain RREs likely also contain a yet undetermined signal or set of signals which prevents normal expression. A primary cause of the poor expression of these ORFs is nuclear confinement. The genome of HIV-1 has an anomalous nucleotide distribution as compared with the set of known coding genes in the human genome. The percent of Adenine averaged over clinical isolates of HIV-1 is above the mean human coding gene. Codon optimized strains, which are widely used in present experiments and vaccine trials, can increase the expression level of Gag transfected into human cells between 500 and 1000 fold. However, the substantial increase in expression due to codon optimization can, at best, indirectly address the problem of nuclear isolation.",
                                "The assembly of HIV virus particles takes place at the cell membrane where the GAG-POL poly-protein packages the viral RNA. The viral particles bud off from the plasma membrane of the host cell, which now contains the HIV ENV and gp41 proteins. After release of the virus particle the viral protease (PR) cleaves the GAG-POL poly-protein giving rise to mature and infectious particles. Vif is believed to be involved in assembly of the virus. Also, NEF and Vpu are involved in the degradation of cellular CD-4 protein and release of viruses from the membrane of infected cells. The Vpr protein is incorporated into the virion at assembly and appears to play a role early in infection, transporting the particle into the nucleus, while Vif antagonizes an anti-viral cellular enzyme activity in the cell. The released infectious virus attaches to and infects additional cells and the progressive infection and killing of CD-4 lymphocytes results in an incapacitated immune system.",

                                "Because the genetic code is degenerate, nucleotide sequences can differ from each other at the nucleotide level but encode the same protein or peptide. However, in nature there is often selective pressure for particular codon usage and AT/GC content. There is also selective pressure for the frequency and order of amino acids in the proteins encoded by the nucleotide sequences. A method that normalizes for each of these selection pressures, and then calculates the average frequency of sequence motifs (for example, sequence motifs of 2-8 nucleotides in length) expected in a genome and compares this to the actual frequency of these motifs, has been developed. This method is described in co-pending provisional patent application No. 60/808,420, and also in Robins et al. (2005), Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 187, p. 8370-74, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. This method can be used to produce a list of over- and/or under-represented oligonucleotide sequence motifs in a genome. Such over- and/or under-represented sequences may contain functional information.",
                                "In the present invention, the method of Robins et al. was used to look for such over- and under-represented sequence motifs in the HIV-1 and human genomes. A sequence motif, AGG, was found to be over-represented in the HIV genome and under-represented in comparable human genes. For example, FIG. 1 shows 48 AGG motifs identified in the HIV-1 the gag gene. Over two thirds of the AGG motifs identified in the gag gene were not in the reading frame that encodes amino acids, suggesting that these sequences were not conserved due to selection at the amino acid/protein level. While third codon position changes are common in different HIV isolates, the AGG motif was also found to be particularly conserved even in the third position of codons. Furthermore, the AGG motif was found to be conserved in over 400 HIV-1 strains analyzed, and also in HIV-2 and in other lentiviruses including FIV, SIV, and EIAV.",

For example, the first nucleotide in an AGG motif may be mutated from an A to a G, T, C, U, or any other naturally occurring or synthetic nucleotide. The second nucleotide in an AGG motif may be mutated from a G to an A, T, C, U, or any other naturally occurring or synthetic nucleotide. The third nucleotide in an AGG motif may be mutated from a G to an A, T, C, U, or any other naturally occurring or synthetic nucleotide.

Furthermore, any two positions of the AGG motif may be changed as described above, or all three positions of the AGG motif may be changed as described above. Mutating an AGG motif to a non-AGG sequence also encompasses other types of mutations, such as inserting one or more nucleotides to disrupt the AGG motif, or deleting one or more nucleotides from the AGG without substituting them for other nucleotides.",

In embodiments where the AGG motif is located in a coding region, the AGG motif can be changed to a sequence that does not alter the amino acid(s) encoded by the nucleic acid. For example, in the event that the AGG motif constitutes a single codon, and thus encodes the amino acid arginine (Arg), the motif can be changed to either AGA, CGG, CGA, CGC, CGU, or CGT, each of which also encode arginine. It is possible that an AGG motif may span two codons in a coding region. If so, it is again possible, that the AGG motif if changed to a sequence that need not alter the amino acid(s) encoded by either of the two codons spanned by the AGG motif. One of skill in the art can readily determine how to change one or more of the nucleotide positions within an AGG motif without altering the amino acid(s) encoded, by referring to the genetic code, or to RNA or DNA codon tables.",

If the AGG motif is changed to a non-AGG trinucleotide that does affect the amino acid(s) encoded, it is possible to make one of more amino acid changes that do not adversely affect the structure, function or immunogenicity of the protein encoded. For example, the mutant protein encoded by the mutant nucleic acid can have substantially the same structure and/or function and/or immunogenicity as the wild-type protein.

The low amounts of viral particles produced during an infection cycle, coupled with their ability to remain intracellular for extended periods of time, limits the exposure of lentiviruses such as HIV to the immune system. This property is advantageous to the virus but adversely affects the ability to generate an effective vaccine. For example, viral vaccines that are designed to infect and replicate in host cells may produce low levels of progeny and remain \u201chidden\u201d in host cells for extended periods of time. Consequently, such vaccines may not be able to effectively trigger an immune response and immunological memory. Similarly, DNA vaccines which encode one or more lentiviral or viral antigens are likely to express low levels of the antigen in the host, in turn limiting the effectiveness of the DNA vaccine in generating an immune response and immunological memory.",

Such mutant viruses would be useful as viral vaccines. Vaccines that comprise, or are derived from, such mutant viruses are described in more detail below. The discovery of the AGG motif of the present invention also raises the possibility of generating mutant viral nucleic acid sequences that produce virally encoded proteins at a much higher rate, and/or in much larger quantities, than would otherwise be the case.

An ideal preventive vaccine will prevent a virus from establishing an infection in a vaccinated subject, i.e. it will provide complete protective immunity. However, even if it does not provide complete protective immunity, a prophylactic vaccine may still confer some protection to a subject. For example, a prophylactic vaccine may decrease the symptoms, severity, and/or duration of the disease. In the case of HIV, a prophylactic vaccine may prevent or delay the progression to full-blown AIDS even if it is not sufficient to provide complete protective immunity. A therapeutic vaccine, is administered to reduce the impact of a viral infection in subjects already infected with that virus. A therapeutic vaccine may decrease the symptoms, severity, and/or duration of the disease.

                                "In one embodiment, the invention provides attenuated viral vaccines having one or more AGG sequences mutated. Attenuated viruses are viruses that have been altered to weaken them, such that they no longer cause disease, but may still stimulate an immune response. There are many ways in which a virus may be attenuated. For example, a virus can be attenuated by removal or disruption of viral sequences required for causing disease, while leaving intact those sequences encoding antigens recognized by the immune system. Attenuated viruses may or may not be capable of replication in host cells. Attenuated viruses that are capable of replication are useful because the virus is amplified in vivo after administration to the subject, thus increasing the amount of immunogen available to stimulate an immune response.",
                                "According to the invention, a suitable attenuated viral strain may be obtained or generated and one or more of the AGG sequences in the attenuated viral strain mutated to a non-AGG sequence. Several attenuated live viral vaccines have been shown to be useful in protecting against lentiviral or viral infection. For example, live attenuated simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have been used to protect primates against challenge with SIV. See, for example, Daniel et al., \u201cProtective effects of a live attenuated SIV vaccine with a deletion in the nef gene\u201d (1992) Science 258, p 1938; Almond et al., \u201cProtection by attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus in macaques against challenge with virus-infected cells\u201d (1995) Lancet 345, p 1342. The methods of attenuation and attenuated viral strains disclosed in these references may be used in conjunction with the invention. Other methods of attenuation have been described by Desrosiers et al. (\u201cIdentification of highly attenuated mutants of simian immunodeficiency virus\u201d (1998) J. Virol. 72, p 1431) and Guan et al. (\u201cConstruction and in vitro properties of a series of attenuated simian immunodeficiency viruses with all accessory genes deleted\u201d (2001) J. Virol. 75, p 4056). It should be noted that SIV is a commonly used model for HIV, and attenuation methods useful in SIV may also be useful for HIV. Published patent application WO/2001/007637 describes a live attenuated HIV vaccine modified to replicate only in the presence of a tetracycline analogue. Various other live attenuated HIV strains have been developed, for example \u201cdelta 4\u201d which is HIV-1 lacking the nef, vpr, vpu, and Nef-responsive element or NRE genes, and \u201cdelta kURN\u201d which is based on the delta 4 vaccine strain but has an additional deletion in the gene encoding the NFkB-binding element. There are also several articles describing how live attenuated HIV vaccines may be generated. See for example, Mills et al. \u201cLive attenuated HIV vaccines: a proposal for further research and development.\u201d (2000) AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 16, p 1453. Any such methods for attenuation may be used in accordance with the invention. If the attenuation methods used involve deletions within the viral genome or within viral nucleic acids, these mutations can be made to be large enough to reduce the chance reversion. For example, 20 bases or more can be deleted if such methods are used.",

Such vaccines are generally non-functional and thus do not express viral genes or replicate in the vaccinated subject. However, the methods of the invention may be used to facilitate expansion and growth of virus in vitro or ex vivo prior to inactivation of the virus. For example, by mutating one or more AGG motifs in a virus to a non-AGG sequence, the rate of viral expansion may be increased such that larger amounts of the virus can be produced and then inactivated for use as a vaccine.",
                                "Any suitable method of inactivation known in the art may be used to inactivate the mutant viruses of the invention, such as chemical, thermal or physical inactivation or inactivation by irradiation with ionizing radiation. For example, Ilyinskii et al. have developed a physical inactivation method for HIV that utilizes gases to rupture/damage the virus structure in a way that renders it non-infective without comprising its tertiary structure and possible immunogenicity (see Ilyinskii et al. \u201cDevelopment of an Inactivated HIV Vaccine\u201d (2001) AIDS Vaccine Sep. 5-8; abstract no. 192). Others have developed a method of inactivating the HIV virus chemically using 0.2% Beta-propiolactone (BPL) while retaining its immunogenicity (see Addawe et al. \u201cChemically inactivated whole HIV vaccine induces cellular responses in mice\u201d (1996) Int Conf AIDS Jul. 7-12; 11:4; abstract no. Mo.A.100). Whole-inactivated HIV vaccines have also been tested in human trials. For example, the therapeutic vaccine Remune\u00ae (also known as \u201cHIV-1 Immunogen\u201d, \u201cSalk vaccine\u201d, or \u201cAG1661\u201d) which is inactivated by a combination of chemical treatment and irradiation, has been studied as an immunotherapy in HIV-infected patients (see, Fernandez-Cruz et al. \u201c5-year evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine (HIV-1 immunogen) administered with antiretrovirals in patients with HIV chronic infection: induction of long-lasting HIV-specific cellular immunity that impact on viral load\u201d (2003) Second International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis and Treatment, Paris, abstract 486).

Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic immunogenic compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent.

                                "Viruses can be purified using chromatography, such as ion exchange, chromatography. Chromatic purification allows for the production of large volumes of virus containing suspension. The viral product of interest can interact with the chromatic medium by a simple adsorption/desorption mechanism, and large volumes of sample can be processed in a single load. Contaminants which do not have affinity for the adsorbent pass through the column. The virus material can then be eluted in concentrated form.",
                                "Anion exchange resins that may be used include DEAE, EMD TMAE. Cation exchange resins may comprise a sulfonic acid-modified surface. Viruses can be purified using ion exchange chromatography comprising a strong anion exchange resin (e.g. EMD TMAE) for the first step and EMD-SO.sub.3 (cation exchange resin) for the second step. A metal-binding affinity chromatography step can optionally be included for further purification. (See, e.g., WO 97/06243).",

This \u201ctentacle chemistry\u201d allows for a large amount of sterically accessible ligands for the binding of biomolecules without any steric hindrance. This resin also has improved pressure stability.",
                                "Column-based liquid affinity chromatography is another purification method that can be used invention. One example of a resin for use in purification method is Matrex\u2122 Cellufine\u2122 Sulfate (MCS). MCS consists of a rigid spherical (approx. 45-105 .mu.m diameter) cellulose matrix of 3,000 Dalton exclusion limit (its pore structure excludes macromolecules), with a low concentration of sulfate ester functionality on the 6-position of cellulose. As the functional ligand (sulfate ester) is relatively highly dispersed, it presents insufficient cationic charge density to allow for most soluble proteins to adsorb onto the bead surface. Therefore the bulk of the protein found in typical virus pools (cell culture supernatants, e.g. pyrogens and most contaminating proteins, as well as nucleic acids and endotoxins) are washed from the column and a degree of purification of the bound virus is achieved.",
                                "The rigid, high-strength beads of MCS tend to resist compression. The pressure/flow characteristics the MCS resin permit high linear flow rates allowing high-speed processing, even in large columns, making it an easily scalable unit operation. In addition a chromatographic purification step with MCS provides increased assurance of safety and product sterility, avoiding excessive product handling and safety concerns. As endotoxins do not bind to it, the MCS purification step allows a rapid and contaminant free depyrogenation. Gentle binding and elution conditions provide high capacity and product yield. The MCS resin therefore represents a simple, rapid, effective, and cost-saving means for concentration, purification and depyrogenation. In addition, MCS resins can be reused repeatedly.",
                                "Inactivated viruses may be further purified by gradient centrifugation, or density gradient centrifugation. For commercial scale operation a continuous flow sucrose gradient centrifugation would be an option. This method is widely used to purify antiviral vaccines and is known to one skilled in the art (See J P Gregersen \u201cHerstellung von Virussimpfstoffen aus Zellkulturen\u201d Chapter 4.2 in Pharmazeutische Biotechnology (eds. O. Kayser and R H Mueller) Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, 2000.)",

An ultrafiltration/dialfiltration and final sterile filtration step could also be added to the purification method.",

For example, entire \u201clibraries\u201d of agents can be screened in this way using high throughput screening methods. One of skill in the art could readily design a high throughput screening method to identify agents that inhibit or stimulate production of lentiviral or viral RNA, production of lentivirus or virus protein or production of lentivirus or virus particles, or that inhibit or stimulate viral latency. Methods for growing cells in multiwell plates are well known, and methods for administering different agents from a library of agents to different wells of multiwell plates are known. Several methods could be used to determine the effects of the library agents on production of lentiviral or viral RNA, production of lentiviral or viral protein or production of lentiviral or viral particles, or on lentiviral or viral latency. For example, the cells used for the high throughput screening could be engineered to encode one or more fusion proteins, such as a fusion between a lentiviral or viral protein and a fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). In this way, production of lentiviral or viral proteins could be monitored by fluorescent detection methods, which would enable agents that stimulate or inhibit production of the lentiviral or viral protein to be detected.",

In one embodiment, the method comprises providing a control nucleic acid containing at least one AGG motif and a test nucleic acid containing at least one AGG motif that has been mutated to a non-AGG sequence, contacting the test nucleic acid and the control nucleic with one or more agents, and identifying at least one agent that binds to the control nucleic acid but does not bind the test nucleic acid, or that binds to the control nucleic acid with a higher affinity than it binds to the test nucleic acid. In another embodiment, the method comprises providing a test nucleic acid containing multiple repeating AGG motifs and a control nucleic acid containing a random assortment and order of nucleotides, contacting the test nucleic acid and the control nucleic with one or more agents, and identifying at least one agent that binds to the test nucleic acid but does not bind the test control acid, or that binds to the test nucleic acid with a higher affinity than it binds to the control nucleic acid. There are multiple ways in which agents that bind to these constructs could be detected. For example, in one embodiment, the above test and control nucleic acids could be provided on a column or one some other suitable solid substrate, and test samples (such as cell lysates or libraries of test agents) could be passed over these substrates. Agents that bind to the test and/or control substrates could be eluted and analyzed. In other embodiments, yeast one-hybrid methods could be used to identify agents that bind to AGG motifs. In further embodiments, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) could be performed to identify agents that bind to AGG motifs. Other methods suitable for identifying nucleotide binding agents are known in the art, and any such method could be used to identify agents that bind to AGG motifs. The invention also encompasses AGG motif binding agents, such as those identified using the methods of the invention.",

                                "Because the genetic code is degenerate, nucleotide sequences can differ from each other at the nucleotide level but encode the same protein or peptide. However, in nature there is often selective pressure for particular codon usage and AT/GC content. There is also selective pressure for the frequency and order of amino acids in the proteins encoded by the nucleotide sequences. A method that normalizes for each of these selection pressures, and then calculates the average frequency of sequence motifs (for example, sequence motifs of 2-8 nucleotides in length) expected in a genome and compares this to the actual frequency of these motifs in that genome, was used to look for sequence motifs that are over- and under-represented in the HIV-1 genome as compared to the human genome. This method is described in co-pending provisional patent application No. 60/808,420, and Robins et al. (Journal of Bacteriology, (2005) Vol. 187, p. 8370-74, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",
                                "Based on the biology of the HIV agent described above, the HIV genome is likely to contain one or more INS motifs. We predicted that these motifs would not be present in host (i.e. human) genes that have a comparable A-rich content (the HIV genome has a high A-content). 4,000 human genes having A-contents comparable to HIV were identified and studied using the methods described above. A sequence motif, AGG, was identified that was under-represented in these human genes as compared to the expected frequency. The same AGG motif was found to be over-represented in both the gag gene and the pol gene of the HIV-1 genome. Of 48 AGG oligonucleotide sequences present in the gag gene (as shown in FIG. 1), over two thirds were not in the reading frame that encodes an amino acids, suggesting that these sequences were not conserved due to selection at the amino acid/protein level. While third codon position changes are common in different HIV isolates, the AGG motif was also found to be particularly conserved even in the third position of codons. Furthermore, the AGG motif was also found to be over-represented in over 400 different HIV-1 strains analyzed (all were found to contain between 44-48 copies of the AGG motif). These results suggest that the AGG motif may have been selected against in the human genome (i.e. in the HIV host), while being retained and/or enriched in the HIV genome. Taken together, these results suggest that the AGG motif may be an INS sequence.",

All of these viruses were found to have the expected or a higher than expected frequency of the AGG motif. However, it was found that the human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1) and the human retrotransposon LINE-1 did not have the expected or higher than expected frequency of the AGG motif.",

Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting can also be used. Cells will be transfected with nucleic acid encoding either wild type GAG-POL-GFP, or mutant GAG-POL-GFP (i.e. a construct having one or more AGG motifs mutated to a non-AGG motif). It is expected that there will be a much higher level of GFP detected in cells transfected with the mutant sequences.",

There are many reasons why it has not been possible to generate such a vaccine. One factor that may have contributed to the difficulty in producing a vaccine could be the ability of HIV to remain intracellular for extended periods of time. Intracellular virus is protected from antibody-mediated (but not CD-8 T-cell-mediated) immunity. The HIV virus is able to remain hidden intracellularly for long periods because of its slow rate of production inside cells, its ability to remain latent inside cells, and its ability to spread from cell to cell by cell fusion provides.",
                                "These properties of the HIV virus may adversely affect the ability to generate an effective vaccine on multiple levels. On one level, vaccines based on the HIV virus, such as inactivated or attenuated HIV vaccines, may enter and remain in host cells for extended periods of time, as do wild type HIV viruses. Thus, because of the slow life cycle of the virus and the limited amount of time during which the viruses are exposed extracellularly, the immune system is not able to generate an immune response strong enough to provide protective immunity against subsequent challenge with HIV. On another level, DNA may express very low levels of HIV-encoded antigens due to the presence of INS sequences, such as AGG motifs, in the nucleic acid constructs used. Generally, the more antigen that is produced, the greater the immune response will be. Thus, if low levels of HIV-antigens are produced, the immune response generated against those antigens will also be low.",
                                "It may be possible to overcome these problems, and thus generate more effective vaccines, by mutating one or more AGG motifs within the viral nucleic acids used in, or used to produce, vaccines. For example, an attenuated HIV vaccine could be produced which in addition to being altered so as to reduce its ability to cause disease, is also mutated to disrupt on or more AGG motifs.",

The ability of these mutated viruses to infect host cells, express the encoded HIV proteins, and produce new virus particles will be studied in vitro using cell culture systems.

Also, the ability of theses mutated viruses to generate an immune response will be tested in vivo in hosts susceptible to SIV and/or HIV infection.

It is expected that cell lines having integrated copies of the wild type AGG will produce low levels of the GAG and POL RNAs and proteins because of the activity of the AGG sequences. It is also expected that some of the clones will not produce any GAG-POL mRNA or protein due to the phenomenon of stochastic phenotypic switching which is believed to be involved in latency. These clones will provide a cell culture model of latency.",

Thus cells expressing GAG-POL-GFP can be detected by fluorescence detection methods, and cell sorting (such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting or FACS) can be used to separate the two, i.e. those expressing and those not expressing GAG-POL-GFP.

The frequency/rate at which the GAG-POL genes are switched on, and the environmental variables that affect the switch can then be measured. Such a model will be useful for identifying agents (such as protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, and other agents) that reverse HIV latency and thus make the virus more responsive to treatment.",

In this study, nine cellular genes, out of 4,000 genes screened, that have AGG frequencies as high as HIV were identified. It is therefore possible that there is a cellular AGG binding protein present in human cells. In order to determine if such a protein exists, and if so isolate the protein, T-cell extracts will be passed over AGG oligonucleotide columns with washes of competitor human DNA. If such a protein is identified, the amino acid sequence of the protein will be determined, and the gene encoding the protein will be identified.",

The short motif, AGG, is identified, which has the maximal differential representation between the coding genes in the human genome and the HIV-1 genome. This identification was made through the use of the methods of the invention. The method identifies dozens of motifs that exhibit substantial differences in representation between the HIV-1 genome and the human coding genes. The results presented in this example focus on a single motif in order to isolate its contribution to expression level in a controlled experiment. A codon optimized version of Gag is modified, making synonymous changes to reduce the number of occurrences of AGG. Two plasmids are created, one with the original codon optimized (CO) sequence of Gag and the other with the motif optimized (MO) sequence with AGG significantly reduced. The constructs are transfected into a human epithelial cell line (293 cells) and expression of Gag is shown to be 70% higher for the MO sequence. The two sequences of Gag are also made into injectable mouse vaccines to test for differential antibody response between the two constructs. The mice with the MO version of the vaccine have a 4.5 fold greater anti-Gag antibody response after 4 weeks. With a DNA boost at four weeks and a second readout at six weeks, the gap continues to widen between the MO and CO vaccines.",

Codon usage is defined to mean the total fraction of each codon used in a given gene. The result of the Robins-Krasnitz method is a set of exact nucleotide motifs of length 2-7 bases which are under and over represented in the coding regions of the human genome. It is these motifs which are compared to the HIV genome. The first step in the Robins-Krasnitz method is the creation of a background sequence to compare with the human genome. This background is a completely randomized version of the coding sequences from the human genome subject to the constraints of amino acid order and codon usage in each gene. A Monte Carlo program that randomly permutes the codons for each amino acid within each gene can be designed. Table 1 is an illustrative example.",

The shuffling procedure randomly permutes L1, L2, L3, and L4 and separately permutes H1, H2, and H3. Each iteration produces a new sequence. For this example, there are 12 different combinations for the leucines and three combinations for the histidines giving 36 unique sequences. They are weighted in the shuffling procedure so that the MED is attained in the limit of a large number of iterations.",
                                "The shuffling procedure described above gives a set of randomized sequences. A probability distribution is extracted form these sequences. As long as the number of occurrences of each motif found in the total set of sequences is reasonably large, a probability distribution can be formed by estimating the probability of a given motif by its fraction in the set of all motifs.",
                                "After the shuffling procedure, two distributions are defined, the real distribution found from the actual sequence and the Maximal Entropy Distribution (MED) which is used as the surrogate for the background. An information theory standard is used as a method for choosing under and over represented motifs. The motif that contributes the most bits of information to the difference between the real distribution and the MED is the first motif chosen. Using information theory has the nice feature of putting all results in the same units, number of bits. This allows a comparison of motifs of different lengths and motifs that are either over or under represented. The formula employed to compute the motif contributing the most bits of information between the two distributions is the Kullback-Leibler distance or the Relative Entropy. The Relative Entropy contribution for each motif is computed and the largest value is selected.",
                                "Once the most under- or over-represented motif in the sequence is identified, the motif which is the next most under- or over-represented is selected. However, once cannot simply take the motif which has the next largest Relative Entropy. This is because the motifs are overlapping, so under or over representation of a given motif affects the distribution of all the other motifs. The example of CpG illustrates this point. In the human genome, the dinucleotide motif CG will have the largest Relative Entropy. However, all eight trimers which contain CG as a subset fall within the top 50 highest Relative Entropy motifs. This is simply an artifact of the selection against CG. It is required that the contribution of CG from the MED be removed before recalculating the Relative Entropy to find the next motif. If the motif is called w, all motifs that contain w are rescaled by the same amount such that the rescaled MED had the same distribution for was the real distribution. This forces the Relative Entropy of w to zero and, at the same time, removes the contribution of w from all other motifs. This choice of rescaling monotonically decreases the overall Relative Entropy between the distributions.",
                                "The procedure is reiterated, so that the contribution of one motif at a time is removed from the Relative Entropy through rescaling of the MED.

As iteration of the procedure continues, and additional motifs are found, until the motif with the largest remaining Relative Entropy is not statistically significant, as determined by comparing shuffled genomes.",

The motifs are restricted to the set of human genes with \u201cA\u201d content within 1% of the average HIV \u201cA\u201d content. The ratios of the densities in the HIV genome are then divided by densities in the human coding regions. If the human density is greater than that of HIV, the quantity is replaced by its reciprocal.

The result is RK-Gag.",
                                "The first step is to determine if RK-Gag has increased expression as compared to the codon optimized verion, Adarc-Gag. Since the modifications in RK-Gag undo part of the codon optimization, the protein expression levels should be expected to decrease unless the motif AGG is significantly inhibiting mRNA processing or transport. To compare expression levels, human 293 cells were transfected in vitro with one of the two different versions of Gag. Measuring the protein levels, RK-Gag was 70% higher than the codon optimized Adarc-Gag (FIG. 2).",

Anti-Gag antibody titers were measured by anti-P24 ELISA at the four week and six week time points (see method for details). The results are found in FIG. 3. The 70% increase in expression in vitro translated into more than a five fold difference in humoral immune response in a mouse model.",

This short motif is rarer in the human coding sequence than mouse, so the results would be expected to be even more dramatic in humans. A set of steps may be required to move in the direction a clinically viable vaccine including recoding the ENV ORF as well and testing its ability to induce an immune response. Another step may be looking for neutralizing antibody responses in primates. The intent of this work is to provide evidence that recoding the HIV ORFs can greatly improve expression and immune response over present codon optimization schemes. Moreover, the application of a method of the invention is an effective means of generating a set of motifs that should be incorporated into the recoding procedure. Systematic inclusion of other motifs determined by the methods of the invention has the potential to improve upon the large gains displayed in this example."
