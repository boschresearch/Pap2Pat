# DESCRIPTION

- claim priority from previous application

## BACKGROUND

- introduce adenosine and its functions
- discuss limitations of current methods for measuring adenosine

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- describe method for simultaneously detecting adenosine and its metabolites

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- correlate adenosine levels with neurological diseases
- describe label-free, enzyme-free, aptamer-free method for detecting adenosine and its metabolites
- outline steps of the method, including HPLC separation and electrochemical detection
- define biological sample and its preparation for analysis

### EXAMPLE 1

- introduce high throughput neurochemical assay for detecting adenosine
- describe preparation of tissue for HPLC-ECD analysis
- outline preparation of standard solutions and biological samples
- compare ADO separation and quantification using different stationary and mobile phases

### EXAMPLE 2

- determine retention time of ADO, ATP, ADP, and AMP

### EXAMPLE 3

- quantify ADO, ATP, ADP, and AMP in brain regions of C57BL/6J mice

### EXAMPLE 4

- quantify ADO in CNS of different mouse strains
