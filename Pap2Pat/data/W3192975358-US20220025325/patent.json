It is composed of five layers: epithelium, Bowman's membrane, stroma, Descemets membrane, and endothelium.1 The corneal endothelium (CE), is a monolayer of hexagonal cells which is critical in maintaining corneal clarity by mediating hydration through barrier and pump functions.2 The CE cell density is approximately 2500 cells/mm2 in adult CE.3 Corneal endothelial dystrophies and surgical trauma are the major factors that contribute to loss of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and a decrease in CE cell density. The physiological functioning of the CE is undermined below 500 cells/mm2 cell density resulting in corneal edema and loss of vision.3",

In brief, hESCs and iPSCs were differentiated into CECs through the neural crest cells (NCCs). The morphology of differentiating hESCs and iPSCs were examined at regular intervals by phase contrast microscopy. In parallel, the expression of pluripotent and corneal endothelium (CE)-associated markers was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The hESC- and iPSC-derived CECs were tightly adherent, exhibiting a hexagonal-like shape, one of the cardinal characteristics of CECs. The CE-associated markers expressed at significantly higher levels in hESC- and iPSC-derived CECs at day 20 compared to their respective levels in hESCs. Importantly, only residual expression levels of pluripotency markers were detected in hESC- and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CECs.",

The endothelium is the innermost layer of the cornea, which is indispensable for the dynamic regulation of conical hydration. It is worth noting that, unlike other cells in the human body, corneal endothelial cells (CECs) damaged by disease and/or trauma are not repaired or replaced by the body. Nearly half of the corneal transplantations performed in the US each year are due to some form of the conical endothelial disease.",
                        "Accordingly, in certain embodiments, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-originated, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)- and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived clinical-grade conical endothelial cells (CECs) are produced and subsequently cryopreserved. In certain embodiments, the CECs are generated from human embryonic stem cells. Treatment of patients using, in certain embodiments, autologous somatic cells, e.g. PBMCs, allows for personalized medicine and establishes a \u201cpatient-specific\u201d therapeutic strategy to generate a renewable supply of CECs for corneal endothelial dystrophies, reducing the dependency of both donor corneas and corneal transplantation. Alternatively, the use of human embryonic stem cells offers an unlimited allogenic supply of CECs for corneal endothelial dysfunctions.",

                        "Corneal Dystrophies. The term corneal dystrophy embraces a heterogeneous group of bilateral genetically determined non-inflammatory corneal diseases that are restricted to the cornea. Clinically, the corneal dystrophies can be divided into three groups based on the sole or predominant anatomical location of the abnormalities. Some affect primarily the corneal epithelium and its basement membrane or Bowman layer and the superficial corneal stroma (anterior corneal dystrophies), the corneal stroma (stromal conical dystrophies), or Descemets membrane and the corneal endothelium (posterior corneal dystrophies). Most corneal dystrophies have no systemic manifestations and present with variable shaped corneal opacities in a clear or cloudy cornea and they affect visual acuity to different degrees. Corneal dystrophies may have a simple autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive Mendelian mode of inheritance. Different corneal dystrophies are caused by mutations in the CHST6, KRT3, KRT12, PIP5K3, SLC4A11, TACSTD2, TGFBI, and UBIAD1 genes.",
                        "Like the other corneal dystrophies, those of the superficial cornea are genetically determined and usually inherited as Mendelian traits. The unique phenotypes of the vast majority of corneal dystrophies are caused by mutations in different specific genes. The phenotype of some corneal dystrophies result from mutations in different genes and different phenotypes may be the result of different mutations in the same gene. Mutations in four genes (KRT3, KRT12, TGFBI, and TACSTD2) are currently known to cause inherited diseases that are apparently limited to the superficial cornea.",
                        "Corneal stromal dystrophies. This group of corneal dystrophies includes macular corneal dystrophy (MCD), granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) type I, the lattice corneal dystrophies (LCD), Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), fleck corneal dystrophy (FCD), congenital stromal corneal dystrophy (CSCD) and posterior amorphous corneal dystrophy (PACD).",
                        "Posterior corneal dystrophies. The group of the posterior corneal dystrophies includes Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), congenital hereditary endothelial corneal dystrophy (CHED) and X-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy (XECD). These diseases are characterized by abnormalities of the corneal endothelium and Descemet membrane. In most of them, a defective active fluid transport by the corneal endothelium causes excessive edema of the corneal stroma and this impairs the clarity of the cornea and reduces visual acuity.",
                        "The prevalence of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) differs markedly in different parts of the world. It is common and the most prevalent corneal dystrophy in the USA, where it affects approximately 4% of the population over the age of 40 years. In the USA, FECD was a leading indication for penetrating keratoplasty and this surgical procedure accounted for 10-25% of all corneal transplants in different series. This is a significant number considering that the annual number of corneal transplants in the USA is >32,000.",
                        "Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a slow progressing disease that usually affects both eyes and is slightly more common in women than in men. FECD is caused by the gradual deterioration of cells in the corneal endothelium (CE); the causes aren't well understood. Normally, these endothelial cells maintain a healthy balance of fluids within the cornea. Healthy endothelial cells prevent the cornea from swelling and keep the cornea clear. In Fuchs' dystrophy, the endothelial cells slowly die off and cause fluid buildup and swelling within the cornea. The cornea thickens and vision becomes blurred.",
                        "As the disease progresses, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) symptoms usually affect both eyes and include: Glare, which affects vision in low light; Blurred vision that occurs in the morning after waking and gradually improves during the day; Distorted vision, sensitivity to light, difficulty seeing at night, and seeing halos around light at night; Painful, tiny blisters on the surface of the cornea; A cloudy or hazy looking cornea.",
                        "Keratoconus. Keratoconus is a progressive thinning of the cornea. It is the most common corneal dystrophy in the U.S., affecting one in every 2,000 Americans. It is most prevalent in teenagers and adults in their 20s. Keratoconus causes the middle of the cornea to thin, bulge outward, and form a rounded cone shape. This abnormal curvature of the cornea can cause double or blurred vision, nearsightedness, astigmatism, and increased sensitivity to light. A small number of people with keratoconus may develop severe corneal scarring or become unable to tolerate a contact lens. For these people, a corneal transplant may become necessary.",
                        "Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome (ICE). ICE is more common in women and usually develops between ages 30-50. ICE has three main features: visible changes in the iris, swelling of the cornea and glaucoma.",
                        "Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE) is usually present in only one eye. It is caused by the movement of endothelial cells from the cornea to the iris. This loss of cells from the cornea leads to corneal swelling and distortion of the iris and pupil. This cell movement also blocks the fluid outflow channels of the eye, which causes glaucoma. There is no treatment to stop the progression of ICE, but the glaucoma is treatable. If the cornea becomes so swollen that vision is significantly impaired, a corneal transplant may be necessary.",
                        "Bullous Keratopathy. Bullous keratopathy is caused by edema of the cornea, resulting from the failure of the corneal endothelium to maintain the normally dehydrated state of the cornea. Most frequently, it is due to Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) or corneal endothelial trauma. Another frequent cause of bullous keratopathy is corneal endothelial trauma, which can occur during intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract removal) or after placement of a poorly designed or malpositioned intraocular lens implant. Bullous keratopathy after cataract removal is called pseudophakic (if an intraocular lens implant is present) or aphakic (if no intraocular lens implant is present) bullous keratopathy.",
                        "Subepithelial fluid-filled bullae form on the corneal surface as the corneal stroma (the deeper layers of the cornea) swells, leading to eye discomfort, decreased visual acuity, loss of contrast, glare, and photophobia. Sometimes bullae rupture, causing pain and foreign body sensation. Bacteria can invade a ruptured bulla, leading to a conical ulcer.",

                        "When induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are used for the therapeutic treatment of diseases, it is desirable to use somatic cells isolated from patients. For example, somatic cells involved in diseases, somatic cells participating in the therapeutic treatment of diseases and the like can be used. Various media that can maintain undifferentiated state and pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are known in this field, and iPSCs can be efficiently isolated by using a combination of appropriate media. Differentiation and proliferation abilities of isolated iPSCs and hESCs can be easily confirmed by those skilled in the art by using confirmation means widely applied to hESCs.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from a 10 ml blood aliquot by density gradient centrifugation and preserved in liquid nitrogen until further use. The PBMCs were reprogrammed with integration-free Sendai virus gene delivery method by expressing pluripotent factors (c-MYC, KLF4, OCT3/4, and SOX2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Embryonic stem cell-like, putative iPSC colonies were selected and expanded for characterization. The iPSC colonies were evaluated for the expression of pluripotent markers, which revealed expression levels of pluripotent markers i.e. NANOG, OCT4, SOX2 and TRA-1-60 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in PBMC-originated, iPSCs comparable to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The PBMC-originated, iPSCs were also assessed for the protein expression of pluripotent markers (SSEA4 and TRA-1-60) by flow cytometry.
