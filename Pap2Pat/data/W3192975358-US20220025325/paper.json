    "abstract": "Here, we evaluate the efficacy of cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs) to form a functional monolayer of corneal endothelium (CE) in rabbits and monkeys. We injected cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs into the anterior chamber of rabbits and monkeys either immediately after mechanical scraping of the central CE or a few days later when corneal edema developed. All preclinical models developed deturgesced and clear corneas following the injection of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs and remained comparable to the corneas of the untreated eye. Confocal scanning microscopy confirmed an intact structure of hexagonal/polygonal cells and immunohistochemical analysis illustrated a monolayer expressing barrier and pump function proteins in the regenerated CE. The necropsy examination confirmed no remarkable change in multiple tissues assessed for teratoma formation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to form a functional CE on the denuded Descemet's membrane.",

                "The corneal endothelium (CE) is the innermost monolayer of the cornea and is composed of hexagonal/polygonal cells that maintain corneal transparency by mediating hydration through the barrier and pump functions (Bonanno, 2012). An adult CE is reported to have a corneal endothelial cell (CEC) density of approximately 2,500 cells per square millimeter (cells/mm2) and the physiological functioning of the CE may be substantially compromised below a CEC density of 500 cells/mm2, which can lead to corneal edema and vision loss (Tan et\u00a0al., 2012).",
                "Currently, the only treatment modality to restore corneal endothelial dysfunction mediated vision loss is human donor tissue\u2013dependent surgical transplantation, whereas full and partial-thickness keratoplasty techniques have been effective in restoring vision in patients affected with corneal endothelial dystrophies. However, in many areas of the world, transplantable-grade donor CE is limited. A global survey of corneal transplant surgery reported a considerable shortage of corneal transplant tissue, with only one cornea available for every 70 patients in need (Gain et\u00a0al., 2016).",
                "CEC injection has received recent attention to address the worldwide shortage of transplantable-grade donor CE. A few preclinical studies have been reported in rabbit and monkey models to assess the technical efficacy of CEC-injection therapy (Okumura et\u00a0al., 2016; Shen et\u00a0al., 2017). Kinoshita and colleagues have reported the successful treatment of 11 patients suffering from bullous keratopathy and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy by injecting cultured human CECs in combination with a rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor into the anterior chamber (Kinoshita et\u00a0al., 2018).",
                "Pluripotent stem cells have the potential to differentiate into several cell types including CECs. A number of investigators have reported the generation of CECs from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (McCabe et\u00a0al., 2015; Song et\u00a0al., 2016; Wagoner et\u00a0al., 2018; Zhao and Afshari, 2016). We previously reported the differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-originated, iPSCs to CECs that share a similar proteome profile with human CE (Ali et\u00a0al., 2018a). We further confirmed that hESC- and iPSC-derived CECs have largely equivalent transcriptome profiles (Ali et\u00a0al., 2018b).",
                "Here, we examine the efficacy of xeno-free cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs as an alternative to donor corneal transplantation in animal models. We demonstrate that cryopreservation does not affect the viability and transcriptome profile of hESC-derived CECs. Cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs form a functional CE when injected into the anterior chamber of both rabbit and monkey corneal endothelial dysfunction models. A complete necropsy examination confirmed no abnormal pathology including teratomas in multiple tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs as an alternative to donor corneal tissue to restore functional corneal integrity and clarity in animal models."

We employed the same 20-day procedure to generate hESC-derived CECs under feeder- and xeno-free conditions. The morphological examination of hESC-derived CECs at day 20 exhibited a hexagonal/polygonal morphology (Figure\u00a0S1). The examination of hESC-derived CECs for expression of zona-occludens-1 (ZO-1) by immunostaining illustrated expression of ZO-1 at cell boundaries (Figures 1A\u20131C) and confirmed the tightly packed layer of hESC-derived CECs generated under xeno-free conditions.Figure\u00a01Characterization of cryopreserved human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived corneal endothelial cells (CECs)(A\u2013C) Immunostaining for zona occludens-1 (ZO-1; a tight-junction protein).

                        "To examine the possible effects of cryopreservation on hESC-derived CECs, we examined the expression profile of hESC-derived CEC pelleted cells stored at \u221280\u00b0C (termed non-cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs) and hESC-derived CECs cryostored in three distinct pools in liquid nitrogen for 40\u00a0days (termed cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs). We first performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for CE-associated markers (AQP1, ATP1A1, TJP1, COL4A1, COL4A3, COL8A1, COL8A2, FOXC1, and SLC16A3) that suggested indistinguishable expression pattern in non-cryopreserved and cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs (Figure\u00a01D).",
                        "We next performed a comparative analysis employing next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the non-cryopreserved and the cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs. These analyses identified the expression (\u22651 FPKM; fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads) of 14,445 and 14,022 genes in the non-cryopreserved and the cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs, respectively (Data S1 and S2) with a high correlation (Pearson coefficient\u00a0= 0.975) (Figure\u00a01E). Comparative analysis of the non-cryopreserved and cryopreserved hESC-derived CEC transcriptomes revealed 13,423 (>96%) genes shared in both transcriptomes (Figure\u00a01F), which supports the notion that cryopreservation, at least up to 40\u00a0days in liquid nitrogen, does not affect the expression profile of hESC-derived CECs."

To investigate the extent of damage induced by mechanical scraping and to confirm that the scraped area is devoid of CECs, Calcein-AM staining was performed in control rabbits prior to the injection model. Staining confirmed that the scraped area was devoid of CECs after mechanical scraping of the CE (Figures S2A\u2013S2D). We further examined the removal of CE and damage, if any, to the DM by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (in controls prior to the injection model in rabbits).

Although multiple studies have shown intracameral injection of cultured CECs into the anterior chamber of bullous keratopathy rabbit models result in regeneration of the CE (Peh et\u00a0al., 2019; Shen et\u00a0al., 2017), we sought evidence to confirm that a functional CE is only\u00a0possible with the injection of CECs and not other\u00a0cell types, including derivatives of CECs. We, therefore, prepared hESC-derived endothelial-mesenchymal transformed CECs (EnMT-CECs) by a procedure described by Yamashita et\u00a0al. (2018). The morphology of the hESC-derived EnMT-CECs was confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy (Figures S4A and S4B). We cryopreserved the hESC-derived EnMT-CECs similar to the cryopreservation procedure adopted for the hESC-derived CECs and injected cryopreserved hESC-derived EnMT-CECs with 100\u00a0\u03bcM ROCK inhibitor in three rabbits (Rd-1, Rd-2, and Rd-3). The injected hESC-derived EnMT-CECs were unable to reverse the induced corneal edema 28\u00a0days postinjection (Figure\u00a0S5). This is in sharp contrast to the corneas of cryopreserved hESC-derived CEC-injected eyes that attained transparency within three\u00a0weeks postinjection (Figure\u00a02). It is noteworthy that hESC-derived EnMT-CECs are generated from the hESC-derived CECs (please see the methods). Taken together, these data confirm that only hESC-derived CECs and not even derivatives of CECs injected into the anterior chamber can form a functional CE in the rabbit injection models."

On day 2 after the removal of the central CE, we injected 1\u00a0\u00d7 106 cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs supplemented with 100\u00a0\u03bcM of ROCK inhibitor in the anterior chamber of the right eyes of two monkeys (M-4 and M-5), and monitored the recovery and formation of a CEC-derived functional CE. Similar to monkeys in the injection model, the corneal thickness of the injected (right) eye increased 2 to 3 times compared with the untreated (left) eye accompanied by loss of corneal transparency. However, the edema resolved, and corneas attained transparency 7-8\u00a0days postinjection in both monkeys (Figure\u00a05).",

The CEC density of the injected (right) eye was >70% of the CEC density of the untreated (left) eye, while the CEC density in the injected eyes of the injury-injection model monkeys is relatively lower compared with the injection model (>70% versus >80%), it remained stable (\u00b16% and \u00b12% for M-4, and M-5, respectively) at the 3- and 18-month postinjection time points (Figure\u00a06B).

                "Herein, we evaluate the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to reconstitute a functional CE in rabbits and monkeys. We confirmed that cryopreservation does not affect the expression profile of hESC-derived CECs through next-generation RNA-Seq analysis. Next, we examined the potential of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to form a functional monolayer of CE in four different corneal endothelial dysfunction models in rabbits and monkeys. Our approach included an injection of 750,000 (in rabbits) and 1\u00a0\u00d7 106 (in monkeys) cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs into the anterior chamber either immediately after mechanical scraping of the central CE or a few days later when corneal edema developed. The eyes (both the injected right and the untreated left eye that served as a control) of all animals were monitored postinjection for corneal transparency, corneal thickness, CE cell density, and CE cell shape. IHC analysis was performed on injected and untreated eyes of both rabbits and monkeys, and CBC analysis and a necropsy examination was completed for all preclinical models.",
                "The corneas of the injected eyes attained transparency within three weeks postinjection in all preclinical models (Figures 2 and 5). Confocal scanning microscopy confirmed an intact layer of hexagonal/polygonal cells in the CE formed from the injected cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs (Figures 3 and 6). The CEC count in the injected eye was >80% of the CEC count of the untreated control eye for all preclinical models except for the two injury-injection model monkeys, i.e., M4, and M5 where the CEC count in the injected eye was \u223c70% of the CEC count of the untreated control eye but remains stable 18\u00a0months postinjection (Figures 3 and 6). Pachymetry confirmed comparable (\u00b120\u00a0\u03bcm) central corneal thickness of the injected and untreated eyes in all preclinical animal models (Figures 3 and 6). IHC analysis illustrated a monolayer of cells expressing barrier and pump function proteins in the regenerated CE (Figures 4 and 7). Finally, all parameters examined during the CBC analysis were within the normal physiological range and necropsy examination confirmed no remarkable change in multiple tissues examined for teratoma formation (Tables S1 and S2). Taken together, these data confirm that cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs can form a functional monolayer of CE on denuded DM even with corneal edema.",
                "The CE maintains corneal transparency by mediating hydration through barrier and pump functions. The physiological functioning of the CE is substantially compromised with reduced CEC density resulting in corneal edema and loss of vision (Bonanno, 2012; Tan et\u00a0al., 2012). In many areas around the world, there is a shortage of transplantable corneal tissue, which results in the inability to restore functional vision in countless patients affected with loss of vision due to corneal endothelial failure (Lehman et\u00a0al., 2015; Mehta et\u00a0al., 2008; Terry et\u00a0al., 2008). Pluripotent stem cells, neural crest cells, skin-derived precursors, and corneal stromal stem cells, etc., have been explored for the possibility of providing functional CECs for the treatment of corneal endothelial dysfunction (Hatou et\u00a0al., 2013; Ju et\u00a0al., 2012; Shen et\u00a0al., 2017; Song et\u00a0al., 2016; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2014).",
                "Injection of cultured human CECs in combination with an ROCK inhibitor into the anterior chamber of the eye has been demonstrated to treat patients with corneal endothelial dystrophies including bullous keratopathy and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (Kinoshita et\u00a0al., 2018). Kinoshita and colleagues injected human CECs that were cultured from donor corneas into the anterior chamber of the eye selected for treatment (Kinoshita et\u00a0al., 2018). The authors confirm the CEC density exceeding 1,000 cells/mm2 accompanied by a decrease in corneal thickness and an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in the majority of treated eyes.",
                "Our approach of delivering CECs is similar to that described by Kinoshita and colleagues (2018). The use of cultured human CECs likely will not alleviate the need for donor corneas. We believe that pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived CECs may be an alternative to providing adequate quantities of CE worldwide to allow treatment for corneal endothelial failure\u2013mediated vision loss. Both hESCs and the anterior segment of the eye have been reported of possessing immune-privileged characteristics (Li et\u00a0al., 2004; Taylor, 2009), which provide an unprecedented opportunity for the use of hESC derivatives in translational research. In line with published reports, we observed no immune rejection resulting from the injection of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs either in the rabbits and/or the monkeys during the postinjection periods.",
                "The use of pluripotent stem cells and/or pluripotent stem cell derivatives raises reasonable concerns about teratoma formation. It is worth noting that our differentiation protocol consists of an intermediate differentiation step, i.e., differentiation of hESCs to neural crest cells before differentiation to CECs, which reduces the chance of having undifferentiated hESC in aliquots of hESC-derived CECs. In line with the advantage of having an intermediate differentiation step, we only identified residual levels of undifferentiated hESCs at day 20 by qRT-PCR, which is consistent with the results of the necropsy examination that confirmed no remarkable change in multiple tissues examined for teratoma formation.",
                "Finally, the fate of the hESC-derived CECs that do not settle on the denuded DM and persist within the anterior chamber remains elusive. Most likely these unsettled cells pass through the trabecular meshwork without blocking the aqueous humor drainage and into the systemic circulation. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that these unsettled cells find their way to other body organs; however, it is worth noting that the necropsy examination of multiple tissues confirmed no remarkable pathology. In short, the precise whereabouts of the unsettled injected CECs remains unknown, and we plan to investigate the fate of the unsettled CECs through labeled pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived CECs in future studies.",
                "In conclusion, our data demonstrate the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs to form a functional CE on denuded DM when injected into the anterior chamber of preclinical models. Moreover, our data provide evidence suggestive of the clinical utility of pluripotent stem cell\u2013derived CECs as an alternative to human donor CE in keratoplasty that will help combat the shortage of transplantable-grade corneal tissue, which, in turn, will help to reduce vision loss from CEC dysfunction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report confirming the efficacy of cryopreserved hESC-derived CECs as an alternative to donor CE in keratoplasty in multiple preclinical animal models."
