# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising N-acetyl-L-cysteine useful for the treatment of endometriosis and indications associated with endometriosis.

## BACKGROUND

Endometriosis is the third leading cause of gynecologic hospitalization in the United States, and affecting an estimated 14 million women in Europe. Widely used numbers for the incidence of endometriosis include 5-10% of all reproductive age women and 30-40% of all women with an infertility problem. It is a disease characterized by the presence outside the uterine cavity of tissue which is histologically identical to endometrium, i.e. the membrane lining the inside of the mammalian uterus. This misplaced tissue develops into growths or lesions (also called implants or nodules) which respond to the menstrual cycle in the same way that the endometrial tissue of the uterus does: each month the tissue builds up, breaks down, and sheds. While menstrual blood flows out from the uterus, instead the blood and tissue shed from endometrial growths has no way of flowing out. This results in internal bleeding, breakdown of blood vessels and tissue from the lesions, and a consequent chronic inflammation.

The two most common symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility. Symptoms can include: dysmenorrhea, i.e. pain before or after menstrual periods, as well as pain during or after sex; pelvic chronic pain or lower back, intestinal, pain; heavy menstrual periods, or spotting and bleeding between periods; painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods; infertility.

The cause of endometriosis is presently not known and several theories have been proposed to give a reason to the ectopic migration and implant of endometrial cells. Recent evidences relate the occurrence of endometriosis to an altered condition of the tissue of origin itself: the eutopic endometrium. There is an increasing agreement within the art that uncontrolled migration, implant and growth of endometriomas originate from disorders in the eutopic endometrial cells. There is currently no cure for endometriosis. A variety of treatment options exist, and there are ways to minimize the symptoms caused by the condition. Besides the use of analgesics for treating pain, treatment of endometriosis is mainly related to the suppression of ovary function in estrogens secretion, therefore hormone treatments of various entities, up to the induction of menopause in the most severe cases. Surgery is used to remove endometriomas, adhesions, peritoneal implants and deep lesions located in the recto-vaginal septum or in other sites (i.e., bladder, bowel), and to relieve pain. However, recurrences occur after both medical and surgical treatments. Young women with endometriosis are often faced with difficult decisions regarding their future reproduction. Hormone treatment, being intended for the suppression of ovary function, is not compatible with pregnancy.

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (hereinafter referred to as NAC) is a well-known drug, which has been used mainly as a mucolytic agent and in the treatment of paracetamol poisoning. In recent years it has also been acknowledged as having other beneficial properties, such as being antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative, and has been suggested for the treatment of a variety of different disorders and symptoms such as schizophrenia, diabetes and cancer. In previous studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying and relating to endometriosis it has been proposed that the increased cell proliferation rates in endometriosis may be induced by oxidative stress in the endometriotic tissue, caused by free radicals or ROSs. It has thus been proposed that new therapeutic strategies for endometriosis may be based on antioxidants and ROS scavengers such as NAC.

### PRIOR ART

Charlotte Ngo et. al. proposed (The American Journal of Pathology (2009), Vol. 175, No. 1, pages 225-234) that oxidative stress might induce or enhance the proliferation of the endometriotic cells in endometriosis. Antioxidants such as NAC were therefore suggested for the treatment of endometriosis. Studies on primary cell lines from patients with endometriosis as well as in a mouse model implanted with endometriotic tissue of human origin showed that NAC abrogated signs of oxidative stress as well as increased proliferation in the respective models. It was thus suggested that antioxidants such as NAC could be used as a safe and efficient treatment of endometriosis.

Nastaran Foyouzi et. al. also proposed (Fertility and Sterility (2004), Vol. 82, Suppl. 3, pages 1019-1022) that antioxidants such as NAC could be used for the treatment of endometriosis. The article discloses an in vitro study where cells isolated from healthy subjects as well as patients with endometriosis were treated with different antioxidant, e.g. NAC. All antioxidants inhibited proliferation of endometrial stromal cells.

In studies by Yan Wo and Sun-Wei Guo (Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation (2006), Vol. 62, No. 4, pages 193-205; European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, (2008), Vol. 137, pages 198-203); patent document US 2007/0287676 A1) the effect of NAC on proliferation and cell cycle arrest in immortalized human endometrial stromal cells was investigated and compared to other agents proposed for the treatment of endometriosis. NAC was shown to have an effect on both proliferation and cell cycle arrest, although not as pronounced as compared with histone deacetylase inhibitors.

In a study by S. Estany et. al. (Journal of reproductive Immunology (2007), Vol. 75, pages 1-10) it was shown that the antioxidant activity of NAC and other antioxidative agents on endometrial cells in culture improved the viability of oxidized cells, by preventing H202 induced cell cytotoxicity.

Other related art include US2003/0190381 A1, WO2004/096206 A2, US6239137 B1, US2003/0119875 A1, US2004/0014672 A1 and WO2005/048822 A2.

Other background art, describing the molecular effect of NAC in the treatment of cancer, include T. Parasassi, et. al. (Cell Death and Differentiation (2005), Vol. 12, No. 10, pages 1285-1296); E. K. Krasnowska et. al. (Free Radicals Biology and Medicine 2008, 45(11): 1566-72) and A. C. Gustafsson et. al. (BMC Cancer (2005), 5:75).

## OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION

The clinical outcome of NAC treatment in endometriosis has, to the knowledge of the inventors, not been determined in the prior art, nor has an efficient dosage regimen for the treatment of endometriosis or the use of NAC for the treatment of indications associated with endometriosis been proposed.

An aspect of the object is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) for use with an effective dosage regimen for the treatment of endometriosis and of symptoms related to endometriosis in mammals, including humans.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In addition an effective dose range of NAC in the treatment of endometriosis is proposed. In one embodiment of the present invention the prescribed treatment regimen may be used e.g in order to control the frequency and the intensity of pain symptoms (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and acyckic chronic pelvic pain), to reduce the size of endometriotic lesions eventually up to their disappearance, to reduce recurrences after surgery and/or to improve fertility.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### NAC in General

N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a well known low molecular weight pharmaceutical drug, with the chemical formula:

The features of NAC are mainly related to its thiol group, which makes it effective in most biochemical pathways were the tripeptide gluthation (GSH), present in all human tissues at relatively high concentrations, even above 10 mM, acts. Cysteine is indeed among the three aminoacids composing GSH, so NAC is considered a precursor of GSH with its de-acetylated cysteine. NAC has been and still is largely used as a mucolytic agent, where the mode of action is generally attributed to the redox breakage of sensitive cysteine disulfur bridges in the mucus proteins. In fact NAC participates to the complex redox cycling of thiol groups, where several enzymes act. Indeed, of extreme physiological importance is the disulfide formation and breakage cycle, a common mechanism by which protein activity and cellular signaling is regulated. Enzymes such as protein tyrosine phosphatases and tyrosine kinases, for example, play pivotal roles in the control of the cell cycle, cell proliferation and differentiation, and many of them are regulated by the redox state of their cysteines.

Overall, although detailed mechanisms of action have not been finally elucidated, NAC appears to act in all biochemical pathways where GSH does. Enzymes and proteins whose activity is modulated by GSH operate is several processes either directly or through a net of signals transduction pathways. In this picture, NAC may either parallel GSH action, or may be even more effective than GSH.

GSH is e.g. normally conjugated to reactive metabolites formed by paracetamol and helps detoxify them. When paracetamol is overdosed GSH is however depleted and the paracetamol metabolites start reacting with cellular proteins, eventually leading to cell death. In the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol poisoning NAC acts instead of GSH in the detoxification of paracetamol metabolites. NAC is believed to be virtually absent of undesired side effect, which is also indicated by the high NAC doses that are used in the treatment of paracetamol poisoning, estimated, for a 70 kg individual, of about 40 g/day.

Contrary to the tripeptide GSH, which can be degraded already in stomach, the simple NAC molecule freely diffuses in almost all tissues and cells. NAC pharmacokinetic studies determined a peak concentration in plasma reached in about one hour, with a half-life of about three hours. Total clearance occurs between six and twelve hours.

### NAC as an Antiproliferative, Differentiating Agent

The inventors have recently found that N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) possesses a marked antiproliferative effect on cancer cells of epithelial origin—the same origin as of endometrial cells (Cell Death and Differentiation 2005, 12(10): 1285-1296). Although cancer and endometriosis are principally unrelated diseases they share some common properties which eventually led the inventors to the idea that NAC might also be useful in the treatment of endometriosis. In particular, endometriosis, just like cancer, is a proliferative disease albeit with other unknown underlying molecular mechanism and aetiology. The observations made in cancer will here be presented as a background to the effects of NAC and as a likely mode of action also in endometriosis.

NAC was used to arrest proliferation and induce differentiation in two adenocarcinoma cell lines and in primary normal keratinocyte cells, all of epithelial origin. In these systems, the differentiation was characterized morphologically, biochemically and through gene expression analysis (the gene expression analysis extensively reported in BMC Cancer 2005, 5: 75).

The antiproliferative effect of NAC, in the study of cancer, was not related to cell death or to toxicity but, instead, was due to the activation of a physiological differentiation pathway, which can be regarded as a normalization of cell functions towards the tissue of origin.

In addition to the decreased proliferation, the morphology of NAC-treated cancer cells was also altered. In vitro, epithelial cells under active proliferation display an irregular morphology—a mesenchymal morphology—and often form several multiple cell layers. On the contrary, when cells undergo a differentiation process, toward the structure and function of their final target tissue, they stop proliferation, their morphology becomes regularly polygonal, each cell sometimes thicker, and they form a single layer of adjacent cells. This process is accompanied by increased cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions, consistent with a shift from a proliferating mesenchymal to an adhesive, less motile and differentiated phenotype.

On a whole, a complex series of metabolic changes were detected after NAC supplementation to cancer cells, all converging in arresting the uncontrolled proliferation and in inducing their terminal differentiation, as depicted in the scheme shown in FIG. 6.

Notably, NAC treatment induced a considerable increase in cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion complexes. Uncontrolled proliferation can be regarded to as a condition where cells have lost the contact inhibition and their ability to respond to differentiation signals. Cells entering the differentiation pathway exhibit a noticeable increase in cell-cell junction complexes, and the process is also generally indicated as contact inhibition. Several evidences indicate that signals for the cells to enter the differentiation end-point originate from the components of cell-cell complexes themselves. These junctions are also a way for the diffusion of signals between cells.

Migrating cells such as endometrial cells in endometriosis, must in addition to a decreased amount of adhesion complexes, possess and secrete enough active matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes devoted to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, to enable migration through the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, in this model of epithelial cancers, NAC was found to down-regulate this enzyme, suggesting that cell migration was hindered. Also, example 1 of the present disclosure indeed shows that NAC, when used according to the present invention for the treatment of endometriosis, down-regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). This suggests that NAC might hinder cell migration both from eutopic endometrium to new implants (prevention of recurrences) and in endometriotic tissue (prevention of further lesions).

A known effect of NAC is also related to its anti-inflammatory effect, a reason for its addition to the family of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The gene expression profile of NAC-treated cells showed, indeed, a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a gene whose induction is associated with inflammatory reactions. Also this effect of NAC was confirmed in endometriotic tissue in example 1 of the present disclosure, suggesting that NAC may also relieve the symptoms related to inflammation in endometriosis. As an example of the ability of NAC to modulate signal transduction in cells through the redox status of sensitive cysteines, the enzyme non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src was studied in an in vitro model of colon carcinoma (CaCo-2) cells and ovary carcinoma (OVCAR-3) cells (Free Radicals Biology and Medicine 2008, 45(11): 1566-72). c-Sre is involved in the proliferation/differentiation switch, and is active in the assembly/disassembly of junctional complexes and of the cytoskeletal organization. This kinase is activated and over-expressed in a number of human cancers, particularly in colon and ovary carcinoma. Conspicuous international drug design efforts are indeed devoted to the search of specific c-Src inhibitors. Instead, it was found that a simple treatment of adenocarcinoma cells with NAC can reach the objective of c-Src inhibition, with a mechanism related to redox transitions in sensitive cysteine residues in c-Src, able to switch off this kinase and to deliver it to endo-lysosomes, where it is stored or degraded. Thus, the NAC induced terminal differentiation in adenocarcinoma cells was related to the inhibition of c-Src. Of note, the activity of this kinase appears of relevance during the decidual phase of endometrial cells cycling, thus suggesting the involvement of its de-regulation in endometriosis (Endocrine Journal, 2008, 55(5): 795-810).

### NAC and Endometriosis.

As explained in the background section it has previously been proposed that NAC could be used in new therapeutic strategies for endometriosis, based on its use as an antioxidant and a ROS scavenger. From the epithelial cancer studies described above the inventors of the present invention noticed that NAC had some advantageous effects, other than those as an antioxidant and a ROS scavenger, on epithelial cancer cells and that those effects could also be useful in the treatment of endometriotic cells, if the endometriotic cells should respond similarly. In particular, it was hoped that the anti-proliferative and differentiating effects of NAC seen in cancer would also occur when NAC was used in the treatment of endometriosis.

It was believed that if NAC had the following molecular effects, which had been observed in cancer, also on endometriotic tissue they would be beneficial for the treatment of endometriosis;


- - i) an increase in cell-cell and cell-substratum junctions,
    consistent with a shift from a proliferating to a differentiated
    phenotype;
  - ii) a decrease in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases,
    associated with a decrease in cell migration;
  - iii) a decrease in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
    associated with a decreased inflammatory reaction;
  - iv) a modulation of c-Src activity to regulate endometrial
    proliferation/deicidualization cycle and to allow pregnancy.

Hence, it was hypothesized that NAC might have the following physiological effects on endometriosis:


- - i) a decrease in endometrial cell proliferation;
  - ii) a reduction of local chronic inflammation, and thus a related
    pain relief;
  - iii) a normalization to the tissue of origin, the eutopic
    endometrium, through a more regular proliferation-differentiation
    cycling;
  - iv) a decreased number of ectopic endometrial cells related to
    decreased cell motility due both to the reduction in tissue
    metalloproteinases and to the increased cell-cell and
    cell-substratum junctions;
  - v) a reorganization of the conformation of estrogen receptors
    through a reassembling of disulfide bridges in relevant cysteine
    residues.

On a whole, the hypothesized outcomes were all verified either directly or indirectly through the patients' response in a clinical study and through histological analysis of their biopsies or, in an animal model, at the level of morphology, histology, biochemistry and molecular biology.

In particular, the inventors have found that NAC indeed reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in endometriotic tissue. They also show that NAC induces the re-localization of E-cadherin from the cytoplasm in endometriotic tissue, to cell-cell junctions in NAC treated tissue. This indicates an increase in cell-cell junctions, which is consistent with a decrease in cell proliferation. Indeed, other effects, such as the increased expression of p21 and the decreased expression of Ki-67, also indicate that NAC treatment in endometriosis leads to decreased cell proliferation. The inventors also show that these molecular effects of NAC treatment of endometriosis lead to a reduction in the size of endometriotic lesions, to pain relief and to desired pregnancy. An advantage with using NAC to treat endometriosis or indications related to endometriosis is that the normally used hormone treatments for endometriosis, which suppress ovary function, do not need to be used. The use of NAC thus, in comparison, increases the likelihood of these patients to get pregnant. NAC treatment before surgery also resulted in more regular and compact endometriomas which were more easily removed and led to extremely low bleeding during laparoscopy.

### Dosage Regimen

From the study of NAC treatment on adenocarcinoma cell lines and primary normal keratinocyte cells (Cell Death and Differentiation 2005, 12(10): 1285-1296), it was concluded that the effective dose of NAC for induction of the antiproliferative-differentiating effect varied and was cell type dependent. The tissue of origin thus dictates the effective NAC concentration required to observe a complete block of proliferation, and has to be determined for each tissue. In addition, the dose of NAC was also related to the cell malignancy. In detail, while normal cells required a low dose to stop proliferating and start differentiating, carcinoma cells with characteristic poorer prognosis required a higher NAC concentration.

For the purpose of the present invention a dosage regimen of NAC for the treatment of endometriosis in a mammal, including human, was developed based on the following criteria:


- - 1) a dosage of NAC per day which is in agreement with other current
    clinical treatments and is considered without undesirable side
    effects;
  - 2) a dose which is considered high enough to fulfill the requirement
    of abnormally proliferating cells, to switch them into the
    differentiation pathway;
  - 3) given a reported decrease in NAC plasma level after prolonged
    treatments (Pendyala L, Creaven P J. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers
    Prev. 1995; 4:245-51), the suspension of the treatment for about
    half of each week was considered for an optimal biological response
    in a treatment for two months or longer.

The composition of the present invention, comprising NAC for the treatment of endometriosis or indications associated with endometriosis is according to one embodiment to be administered at a dose between approximately 20 and 90 mg/kg/day. The lower limit is based on twice the dose used for mucolytic action, i.e. it is per se known to have a physiological effect. The upper limit is based on the consideration that higher doses have been found to cause gastric problems in many patients. In another embodiment of the present invention the composition comprises NAC to be administered at a dose of approximately 30-60 mg/kg/day. The lower limit has been shown to be effective in endometriosis and the higher limit is known to have virtually no side effects. In still another embodiment of the present invention the composition comprises NAC to be administered at a dose of approximately 30-45 mg/kg/day. This low dosage has surprisingly been shown to be effective in endometriosis.

In one embodiment the composition is to be administered for a period of time which is two months or more, or preferably three months or more. To counteract a decrease in NAC plasma level after prolonged treatment NAC may be administered at the prescribed dosage in an intermittent fashion, i.e. intermittent dosage regimen/treatment. By intermittent administration or treatment is meant that the treatment is interrupted in periods, i.e. that the pharmaceutical composition is administered for a period of time, e.g. a few days, followed by an interruption in administration, where no pharmaceutical composition is administered for a period of time, e.g. for a few days. Intermittent treatment can be regular, e.g. treatment for a fixed number of days or weeks, followed by interruption for a fixed number of days or weeks. Examples include repeated schemes with treatment for 4 days followed by interruption for 3 days each week or treatment for 2 weeks followed by interruption 1 week. A special case of regular intermittent treatment is pulsed treatment, i.e. with regular treatment and interruption duration, e.g. administration every other day or administration for two days followed by two days of interruption etc. Irregular intermittent treatment schemes that are not regularly repeated or have a more complex scheme that is repeated is also conceivable, e.g. dependent on response to treatment. In different exemplifying embodiments of the present invention the prescribed dose of NAC is administered for 3-5 consecutive days followed by 2-4 days of interruption, or administered for 1-3 consecutive days followed by 1-2 days of interruption.

In one embodiment, by referring to a body weight of approximately 60 kg, the NAC dose is in the range between 1.2 and 5.4 g/day, preferably between 1.8 and 3.6 g/day. The dose may be divided in two or more, preferably three or four, daily administrations of either one or two doses (e.g. pills) each, where each dose may comprise e.g. 0.15-2.7 g of NAC or preferably 0.6-1.2 g of NAC. The treatment includes the administration of the above mentioned doses pulsed or intermittently, e.g. every other day or for three to four consecutive days each week, with a suspension from four to three days, respectively. The minimum total duration of the treatment is of two months, with no maximum duration. For patients with other weights, e.g. over- or underweight persons the daily dose needs to be adjusted accordingly.

In one embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition for treatment of endometriosis or endometriosis related symptoms comprises NAC in a dose of 150-5400 mg to be administered in two or more administrations per day, for a period of at least 2 months, such as at least 3 months. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC in a dose of 230-3600 mg to be administered in two or more administrations per day, for a period of at least 2 months, such as at least 3 months. The treatment includes the administration of the above mentioned doses pulsed or intermittently, e.g. every other day or for three to four consecutive days each week, with a suspension from four to three days, respectively.

### Pharmaceutical Formulations

A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be prepared in a manner per se known by a person skilled in the pharmaceutical art. The composition may comprise an effective amount of NAC, in accordance with the invention, as well as a suitable carrier or excipient that serves as a vehicle or medium for the active ingredient. Such carriers or excipients are known in the art and include solid materials such as citric acid, natrium citrate, natrium (acid) carbonate plus flavoring. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably adapted for oral administration. Such compositions could be administered in different forms, at present preferably as tablets. Other forms, such as capsules, suppositories, solutions, suspensions, syrups or the like are also conceivable.

The invention requires a strict assessment of the pharmaceutical quality of NAC preparation for obtaining the effective dose. Therefore, brand or certified generic preparations have to be used. NAC is not a stable molecule, its active thiol residue can be easily oxidized by oxygen, light and other radiations, so that the effective dose would not be reached. The preparation is thus preferably protected from light, in soluble tablets, with sodium hydrogen carbonate, which helps in a partial removal of oxygen from water during dissolution.

It has been observed that high doses of NAC may cause abdominal pain. For overcoming this, an option is to provide NAC in a formulation with gastric protection, suitable for preventing NAC release/solubility in the stomach. Such formulations are well known in the art and may be used with the present invention. For example, tablet coatings that are resistant to gastric fluids and allow release of the drug only in the intestine, after its transit through the stomach, may be used. Commonly used formulations include polymers such as cellulose derivatives, methacrylate amino ester copolymers. The coating protects the tablet core from disintegration in the acidic environment of the stomach by employing pH sensitive polymer, which swell or solubilise after having passed through the stomach, in response to an increase in pH, to release the drug. Another option is to lower the dose of NAC entering the blood stream at any one time.

Administration of NAC three or more times daily can be difficult to accomplish for the patient. Nevertheless, a repeated administration can be desirable to achieve a nearly constant serum concentration of NAC. To overcome these problems, a once or twice-a-day administration could be easier to handle for the patient, for instance morning and night. One option is to provide NAC in a slow-release formulation (also denoted sustained-release or controlled-release). By being able to reduce the rate of diffusion and uptake of NAC into the blood stream such a formulation enables administration of a larger dose at longer intervals. The dose is then distributed in the blood over a long time in small quantities, e.g. over 12+12 hours in the case of a twice-a-day regimen scheme. Many different technologies and formulations for slow-release are since long known in the art and may be applied with the present invention. In such technologies the active substance is for example encapsulated in a coating or matrix that is insoluble or less soluble in the body fluid where it is administered.

Formulations having a combined effect of slow-release and gastric protection is also possible and may be used within the present invention.

### Use/Medical Indications of the Present Invention

The present invention has been shown to have beneficial properties in many aspects related to endometriosis and may be used both for the treatment of endometriosis and for treatment of various indications associated with endometriosis. By treatment of various indications associated with endometriosis is meant e.g. treatment to ease the symptoms of the disease such as pain and inflammation; treatment to increase the likelihood of getting pregnant; pre-treatment before surgery to ease the removal of endometriotic lesions and to improve the outcome of surgery; treatment after surgery to prevent the recurrence of lesions; and preventive treatment in case of validated, assessed risk factors or presence of familial endometriosis.

NAC, according to the present invention, has been shown to decrease lesion size and to revert proliferative tissue to more differentiated, normal tissue. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC for the treatment of endometriosis in order to reduce—eventually up to their disappearance—endometriomas, adhesions, peritoneal implants and deep lesions located in the recto-vaginal septum or in other sites.

NAC, according to the present invention, has also been shown to relieve the symptoms of pain caused by endometriosis. Thus, in another embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC to relieve pain associated with endometriosis. In another embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC for the promotion of a desired pregnancy in a person with endometriosis.

In still another embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC for pretreatment of laparoscopy or surgery in cases of endometriosis, to facilitate the mass removal, decrease bleeding, make tissues more compact/less fragile. In another embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC for the prevention of recurrences after laparoscopy or surgery. In still another embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition comprises NAC for the use in case of validated, assessed risk factors, for prevention of endometriosis due to familial incidence.

## EXAMPLES

The invention will now be further described and illustrated by reference to the following examples. It should be noted, however, that these examples should not be considered as limiting the invention in any way.

### Example 1

**Materials and Methods**

- Materials. Unless specified, all chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich,
  Milan, Italy.
- Animals. 36 female, 6 to 8 weeks-old BALB/C mice were purchased from
  Charles River Italia (Calco, Italy). Pellet food (enriched standard
  diet; Mucedola, Milan, Italy) and water were provided ad libitum.
  Animals were kept on a light/dark cycle of 16/8 hours under controlled
  conditions. Prior to any invasive procedure, the mice were
  anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.4 ml of a
  physiological solution containing 2.5% AVERTIN.
- Induction of endometriosis. Induction of endometriosis was performed
  following the method described in Somigliana et al, Hum Reprod 1999
  December; 14(12):2944-50. Surgical interventions were performed under
  clean conditions. Briefly, uterine horns of syngenic mice were removed
  through a small midline incision into the peritoneal space, just below
  the umbilicus, and put into a Petri dish containing phosphate-buffered
  saline (PBS). Endometrial fragments were obtained by finely chopping
  uterine horns by using a razor blade. Fragments were suspended in 0.6
  ml of PBS and rapidly inoculated into the peritoneal cavity of
  recipient mice with a ratio of one donor to two recipients. The
  endometriosis-induced mice were randomly divided into two groups of 12
  mice each: control and NAC-treatment.
- NAC Treatment. The day after the endometrial implant, mice of the
  treatment group were subjected to gavage with 100 \[mu\] \[iota\] of
  the 10 mg/ml stock solution of NAC in water. The control group only
  received water. NAC administration was continued daily for 21 days.
  Given the average mouse body weight of 22.5+−0.7, the NAC dose of 1
  mg/mouse corresponds to 44 mg/kg/day. No evidence of toxicity was
  noted at the administered dose based on body weight—unchanged at the
  end of treatment—food consumption, grooming behavior, or activity
  levels compared with controls. At the end of treatment, mice were
  killed through cervical dislocation.
- Collection of endometriomas. At the end of the treatment, animals were
  sacrificed and endometriotic lesions were carefully excised from the
  surrounding tissue, their total weight and number was assessed. Cysts
  were either immediately fixed in 10% formalin or frozen in liquid
  nitrogen and stored at −80 \[deg.\] C.
- Histology and immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed samples were
  paraffin-embedded and tissue sections (5 \[mu\] \[iota\] \[eta\]
  thick) were stained using haematoxylin-eosin. All slides were
  evaluated by an experienced pathologist who was blind to the study and
  the histological diagnosis of endometriosis was based on the
  morphological identification of endometrial glandular tissue and
  stroma.

For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in graded ethanol. For antigen retrieval, sections were microwaved for 6 min in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by a 20 min incubation in 3% H202/methanol. Sections were rinsed in PBS/TritonX-100, immersed for 15 min in PBS-bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1% to block unspecific binding sites, and then incubated with the selected primary antibody diluted in PBS-BSA 1%. For the immunodetection of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 (Rabbit anti-mouse polyclonal, Cayman Chemical, Milan, Italy), Ki-67 (Rabbit anti-human polyclonal, Monosan Xtra, DBA Italia, Segrate, Italy), and E-cadherin (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy), incubation was performed overnight at 4 [deg.] C. and the dilutions were 1:100, 1:600, 1:200, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining was continued using the DAKO Cytomation LSAB2 System-HRP (Dako Italia, Milan, Italy) and the antibody binding sites were visualized by strept Rabbit anti-human polyclonal, avidin-biotin peroxidase complex solution using diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, mounted in Canada balsam and then observed with a Leica microscope. The quantification of Ki-67 expression was carried out in a blind fashion by two independent observers; each observer counted at least 200 cells in more than 10 randomly chosen fields for each sample and the Ki-67 labeling index was expressed in percentage.


- RNA extraction, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Total RNA was
  isolated by lysing the frozen endometrial cysts with TissueLyser
  (QIAGEN, Milan, Italy) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy)
  according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total
  RNA from each sample was treated with 1 U of DNAse I (Invitrogen) and
  reverse transcribed with 200 U of Superscript III Reverse
  Transcriptase (Invitrogen), using 250 ng of random primers in 20
  \[mu\] l of final volume. The same cDNA product obtained from each
  sample was used for subsequent PCR amplification with the primer sets
  prepared for the target genes. 18S RNA housekeeping gene was used as
  the internal control. Negative control samples consisted of reaction
  mix and primers without cDNA template. Primer sequences (Table I) were
  designed using the software Primer-BLAST available online from:
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1

First, the ratio between the sample and the housekeeping gene was calculated by simultaneous amplification of gene-specific mRNA and 18S RNA in a single reaction tube. Since this procedure was not successful for all samples—likely due to the relative small number of specific transcripts thus of a preferential amplification of 18S mRNA—to prevent quantitative inaccuracies deriving from competitive effects, the target genes and 18 S cDNA generated in the same RT reaction were amplified in separate tubes. To document amplification in the exponential range, an amplification plot for 18S RNA was generated and the appropriate number of cycles was selected. Semi quantitative PCR was performed in a 25 [mu] [iota] reaction volume, with 1 [mu] [iota] of cDNA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 [mu] [Mu] of each primer and 1.25 U of Hotstart Taq Polymerase (QIAGEN). The PCR amplification was performed by iCycler (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy). PCR products were then resolved electrophoretically on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The levels of target mRNA were estimated by densitometric scanning and normalized against 18S loading controls. The densitometric analyses of the PCR products were performed using an image software Quantity One (VersaDOC, Bio-Rad).

**Results**

- Effect of NAC treatment on the growth of endometriotic lesions.
  Twenty-one days after the induction of endometriosis, all experimental
  mice were sacrificed and their endometriomas removed and collected. Of
  the 12 control mice, one died and one did not develop endometriomas.
  Of the 12 mice treated with NAC two did not develop endometriomas.
  Morphologically, ectopic lesions were large, cystic and vascularized:
  they consisted of fluid-filled cysts, which were either white, red or
  occasionally brown in color, and preferentially localized on the
  peritoneum of abdominopelvic cavity. In the insets of FIG. 1.1, we
  report representative pictures of cysts from control (A) and
  NAC-treated (B) animals. On average, a significant weight reduction
  was observed in the treated group (n=10) compared with the controls
  (n=10) (FIG. 1).
- NAC reduces COX-2 and MMP-9 expression, and switches off
  proliferation. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that, relatively to cysts
  from control mice (n=5), NAC treatment (n=5) induced a significant
  reduction in the levels of COX-2 (−32%) and of MMP-9 (−34%) mRNA, with
  a significance p\<0.01, as normalized to the 18S expression (FIGS. 2A
  and B). The P21 gene, typically expressed only when the proliferation
  cycle is blocked, was never expressed in the 5 controls, while it was
  expressed in 3 of the 5 examined NAC-treated samples (representative
  example in FIG. 2A).
- NAC drives E-cadherin relocalization. Immunohistochemical detection of
  E-cadherin was positive in 100% of examined cases. Labeling was
  restricted to glandular epithelial cells while none of the sample
  presented stromal staining. At a cellular level, in cysts from control
  mice we found that E-cadherin staining was diffused all over cell
  cytoplasm, whereas in cysts from NAC-treated mice E-cadherin was
  mainly detected along cell-cell junctions (FIG. 3). E-cadherin is part
  of the multiprotein adhesion complex, therefore its increased presence
  at the cell borders indicates an increase in cell-cell adhesions. In
  addition and in agreement with the P21 expression reported above, this
  relocation is consistent with the loss of cells' proliferating
  behavior switched towards terminal differentiation (Conacci-Sorrell et
  al, J. Clin. Invest. 2002, 109: 987-991; Parasassi et al, Cell Death
  Differ. 2005, 12: 1285-1296).
- NAC treatment decreases the amount of Cox-2 in endometriomas.
  Immunohistochemical detection of the inflammation-related Cox-2
  protein revealed that relatively to cysts from control mice, the
  samples collected from NAC-treated mice displayed quite a decreased
  staining, that, in some cases, was completely absent (FIG. 4).
- NAC decreases the number of proliferating cells. The Ki-67 antigen
  (Ki-67) is a classic marker of cellular proliferation, with resting,
  non-cycling cells completely lacking Ki-67 expression. When used to
  stain cysts from control mice, several labeled cells could be detected
  (arrows in the panels A-C of FIG. 5). Instead very little labeled
  cells were detected in cysts from NAC-treated mice (arrows in D-F
  panels of FIG. 5). A statistical evaluation performed on 8 animals for
  each group (10 images/200 cells mouse) gave a reduction in
  proliferating cells of 54% (Table II).

**Discussion**

The animal model of endometriosis was effective in inducing ectopic endometrial implants. Only one animal in the control and two in the NAC-treated group did not show endometriomas. Consistently with expectations, the weight—proportional to dimension—of cysts was lower in NAC-treated mice. This can be attributed to an antiproliferative effect of NAC (Parasassi et al, Cell Death Differ. 2005, 12: 1285-1296), as extensively illustrated here by the gene expression analysis and by immunohistochemistry. Indeed P21, a gene only expressed in differentiating, non-proliferating cells, was observed in 60% of NAC-treated animals while it was not expressed in controls. Conversely, the Ki-67 protein, which is only expressed in proliferating cells, showed a 54% decrease in NAC-treated relatively to control mice.

Proteins of relevance in endometriosis, such as the MMP-9 (Collette et al., Hum Reprod 2006; 21: 3059-3067) and Cox-2 (Carli et al, Endocrinology 2009; 150: 3128-3137), showed a decrease after NAC treatment. MMP-9 is considered fundamental for cell motion and invasive behavior, while Cox-2 is a paradigmatic enzyme associated to inflammation. Both relative genes showed a decrease of about 30% after NAC treatment. In addition, the amount of Cox-2 was also examined by histochemical staining in cysts and the results showed a relevant decrease in staining.

Based on the widely accepted notion considering cytoplasmic E-cadherin as a marker of proliferative cell behavior, while, on the opposite, its location at the cell-cell adhesion complex is considered both a marker and an inducer of differentiation, we also examined E-cadherin location in cysts from control and NAC-treated mice. The results are in a perfect agreement with our previous findings on adenocarcinoma cells (Parasassi et al., Cell Death Differ. 2005, 12: 1285-1296), showing a relocation of E-cadherin from cell cytoplasm to the cells borders after NAC treatment. This association of E-cadherin to adhesion complex is also in agreement with a less motile, less invasive cell behavior.

In conclusion, from all examined respects NAC can constitute an optimum treatment in endometriosis. When translated to the treatment of women, this drug has the relevant advantage of being virtually free of side effects, in comparison with the magnitude of undesired effects due to hormone treatment. NAC can therefore be used to reduce cyst dimension, to decrease local inflammation and the associated chronic pain, and to reduce recurrence after surgery. This last point is motivated by a decreased proliferation and decreased cell motility.

**Preliminary Clinical Study on the Effect of NAC to Treat Endometriosis**

- Aim of the study. This pilot clinical study was designed to treat
  women with endometriosis by using NAC instead of other treatments. The
  only possible additive treatment was with analgesics for pain relief,
  when needed.
- Criteria for patient enrollment. Women with a first diagnosis of
  endometriosis, based on pain and on ovarian ultrasound evidence of the
  disease, and patients with a recurrence of pain and/or ovarian
  endometrioma after laparoscopic treatment were enrolled in the study,
- Before treatment, the intensity of pain symptoms was measured by the
  means of a 10 points visual analogue scale (VAS) and the
  characteristics of the ovarian endometriomas by transvaginal
  ultrasounds. During NAC treatment, other treatments are excluded with
  the exception of analgesic to treat pain, when needed.
- Patients. From February 2008 to July 2010, 64 women diagnosed for
  ovaric endometriosis were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of
  35+−7 years (—−SD). Of them, 33 were assigned to NAC treatment (mean
  age: 37+−6 years), while 31 did not follow NAC or any other treatment
  and were considered as control cases (mean age: 33+−8 years). All of
  them presented one or more cysts at one or both ovaries.
- Treatment. The prescribed NAC dose was close to that used in the
  animal study, of 30 mg/kg/day. In practice, for an average body weight
  of 60 kg, the prescription for all enrolled patients was of three oral
  doses of 600 mg NAC, three times a day, for three consecutive days
  each week, with four days of interruption. This resulted in 1.8 g of
  NAC per day, 5.4 g per week, 21.6 g per month. These precise
  modalities of treatment were based on the following considerations: 1)
  the dose of 1.8 g of NAC per day is in agreement with other current
  clinical treatments and is considered without undesirable side
  effects; 2) given NAC pharmacokinetics, the three daily doses of 0.6
  mg approach a nearly constant plasma level, without discomfort of
  patients for a complex treatment; 3) given a reported decrease in NAC
  plasma level after prolonged treatments (Pendyala L, Creaven P J.
  Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1995; 4:245-51), the suspension of
  the treatment for about half of each week warrants an optimal
  biological response in a lengthy treatment, e.g. two to six months or
  longer.
- Follow-up. Pain symptoms intensity (VAS pain scale) and the size of
  the ovarian endometriomas (clinical and US exams) were evaluated after
  the first three months of treatment. If necessary, laparoscopic
  treatment was performed after 3 months.

**Results**

Data after the first three-month follow-up period are reported below.

The modification in size of cysts (unchanged, increased or decreased) after three months of NAC treatment, as measured by ultrasound as the maximum diameter, is shown in FIG. 7A (absolute number of cysts) and FIG. 7B (percent cysts). The figures show a comparison of cysts in NAC treated patients and cysts in untreated controls. In percent terms (FIG. 7B), a decrease in cyst size was observed in 38% cases, while in controls only less that 10% cases showed a spontaneous decrease. Given the reduction of endometrioma size, several (21 out of 33) patients decided to cancel or postpone the programmed laparoscopy.

Pain perception was also modified after NAC treatment. Pain was evaluated, before and after the three-months treatment, by a 10-points visual analogue scale (VAS) with zero representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain. Intensity of symptoms were classified as none (0), mild (1-4), moderate (5-7), or severe (8-10). NAC-treated patients reported an average pain reduction, from 7.6+−0.3 to 5.1+−0.8 (p<0.01) after three months of treatment.

No adverse side effects were reported.

Although we did not evaluate whether patients desired pregnancy, and therefore cannot attribute a statistical significance to our finding, we also report three cases of pregnancy, obviously not possible with the currently used therapies for endometriosis, targeting a suppression of ovary function.

Anecdotic was the observation, reported by an experienced surgeon, that at laparoscopy after NAC treatment, the endometrioma was more regular and compact and more easily removed, therefore associated with a relevant reduction in bleeding during laparoscopy.

In an additional case, a recto-vaginal septum nodule disappeared, suggesting NAC efficacy beyond ovaric endometriomas.

### Example 3

**Materials and Methods**

- Animals. 16 adult virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. They
  weighed 200-230 g at the start of the study and were housed
  individually in a temperature-controlled room in plastic cages lined
  with bedding. The rats had ad libitum access to water and rat chow and
  were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with lights on at 07:00.
  Reproductive status (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) was
  determined by daily vaginal lavage performed.
- Experimental model and pre-surgical training. Prior to induction of
  endometriosis rats were trained to perform an escape response to
  terminate vaginal distention produced by an inflatable latex balloon.
  A small uninflated latex balloon was tied to a thin catheter
  lubricated before being inserted into the mid-vaginal canal. Inflating
  the balloon with different volumes of air distended the vaginal canal.
  The pressure produced by each volume of distention was control
  measured through a small-volume pressure transducer. The testing
  apparatus was a small cylindrical plexiglass chamber designed to
  contain the rat just enough to prevent her from turning around. An
  opening in the rear of the chamber allowed the catheter attached to
  the vaginal stimulator to be connected to a stimulus apparatus. A
  photosensor determined the position of the rat in the chamber. If the
  rat extended, as part of an escape response, the light beam was broken
  and the stimulus was terminated. The rats were adopted to the testing
  chamber by placing it in the chamber for 15 min daily for 5 days. The
  rats were then, during training sessions, accustomed to a mechanical
  escape response to deflate vaginal distension, which involved the rat
  extending her head to interrupt the light beam. All rats learned the
  escape response within 4 sessions. Once trained, testing sessions
  began.

Testing sessions were run 3 times/wk on non-consecutive days. Each testing session included a series of controlled escape trials. Each trial consisted of rapid inflation of the balloon (1 ml/s) to a fixed volume, where it remained until either the rat made an escape response or 15 seconds elapsed, and the balloon rapidly deflated. Different distention volumes, including a control volume (0.01 ml), were delivered three times each in random order. The maximum latency of 15 seconds was considered to be no response.

Time to response and escape responses were measured as a function of distention volume for each session, as described in Cason A M et al (Horm Behav. (2003), Vol. 44, pages 123-31). The shorter the time to response and the smaller the volume giving response, the greater the escape response in the rat. For each rat, the escape responses and pressures/volumes for all of that rat's sessions (at least 12 sessions) were combined, and the mean values calculated. In all four experimental groups (see below), baseline escape responses to vaginal distention prior to the endometriosis surgery was found to be very similar.


- Induction of endometriosis. Endometriosis may be experimentally
  induced in rats by autotransplanting pieces of uterus. The
  endometriosis surgery was done following a protocol originally
  developed by Vernon and Wilson 1985 (Fertility and Sterility, 1985,
  Vol. 44, pages 684-694). Rats in diestrus were anesthetized, placed on
  heating pad to maintain body temperature and the surgery carried out.
  A midline abdominal incision was made to expose the uterus. Four
  pieces of uterine horn were sewn around alternate cascade mesenteric
  arteries that supply the caudal small intestine. Postoperative
  recovery was uneventful and regular estrous cyclicity resumed in all
  rats within one week.
- NAC treatment. All rats were treated with NAC at a dose of 60
  mg/kg/day (where applicable on days when administered) or placebo for
  8 weeks after surgery. The rats were divided into four experimental
  groups:
- A first group received pulsed NAC treatment, i.e. treatment every
  other day.
- A second group received intermittent NAC treatment, i.e. daily
  treatment for 5 days and 2 days rest (i.e. 2 days without treatment).
- A third group received daily NAC treatment.
- A fourth group received sham treatment, i.e. placebo treatment.
- The escape response to terminate vaginal distention, as described
  above, was assessed after 8 weeks.

**Results**

- The results indicate that vaginal hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity
  to pain) was induced in rats following uterus surgery.
- Escape response (i.e. time to response and number of responses within
  15 seconds at a certain distension volume, compared to the control
  group) and vaginal pressure to different volumes of distention of the
  vaginal canal were determined. Results are shown from the four
  different experimental groups (the sham group values are used as
  baseline values)
- The relative reduction in escape response at 0.5 ml distension volume
  in relation to the sham treated group was
- 1. for the pulsed NAC treatment group: 32% reduction in escape
  response.
- 2. for the intermittent NAC treatment group: 28% reduction in escape
  response.
- 3. for the daily NAC treatment group: 18% reduction in escape
  response.  
  The results thus interestingly show that the pain reducing effect
  induced by NAC treatment was more marked in the pulsed treatment group
  and in the intermittent treatment group as compared to the group that
  received daily treatment.
