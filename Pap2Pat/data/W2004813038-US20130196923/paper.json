    "title": "Black mamba venom peptides target acid-sensing ion channels to abolish pain",
    "date": "2012-10-03",
    "abstract": "A new class of peptides, mambalgins, is isolated from the African snake the black mamba, which can abolish pain through inhibition of particular subtypes of acid-sensing ion channels expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. This paper reports the isolation of a new class of peptides from the African black mamba snake that can abolish pain through the inhibition of particular subtypes of acid-sensing channel (ASIC) expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides \u2014 called mambalgins \u2014 are as effective as morphine when it comes to pain relief but are nontoxic in mice and do not induce tolerance or respiratory distress. Their effect differs from the analgesia associated with previously identified animal peptides that can block ASICs, whose action involves activation of the enkephalin system. Polypeptide toxins have played a central part in understanding physiological and physiopathological functions of ion channels1,2. In the field of pain, they led to important advances in basic research3,4,5,6 and even to clinical applications7,8. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are generally considered principal players in the pain pathway9, including in humans10. A snake toxin activating peripheral ASICs in nociceptive neurons has been recently shown to evoke pain11. Here we show that a new class of three-finger peptides from another snake, the black mamba, is able to abolish pain through inhibition of ASICs expressed either in central or peripheral neurons. These peptides, which we call mambalgins, are not toxic in mice but show a potent analgesic effect upon central and peripheral injection that can be as strong as morphine. This effect is, however, resistant to naloxone, and mambalgins cause much less tolerance than morphine and no respiratory distress. Pharmacological inhibition by mambalgins combined with the use of knockdown and knockout animals indicates that blockade of heteromeric channels made of ASIC1a and ASIC2a subunits in central neurons and of ASIC1b-containing channels in nociceptors is involved in the analgesic effect of mambalgins. These findings identify new potential therapeutic targets for pain and introduce natural peptides that block them to produce a potent analgesia.",

                "Mambalgins were purified from Dendroaspis polylepis polylepis venom (Latoxan, France) using cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography steps. The molecular mass and peptide sequence were determined by Edman degradatation and/or MS/MS sequencing, and used to design primers for cloning the full-length mambalgin-1 cDNA from venom. The 3Dstructure was modeled from five templates of three-finger snake toxins. Recordings of recombinant ASIC currents were done after expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes 14 and COS-7 cells, and patch-clamp recordings of native ASIC currents were obtained from primary cultures of mouse dorsal spinal cord neurons 16 , hippocampal neurons and rat DRG neurons. Pain behavior experiments were performed in C57BL/6J mice after i.t. (or i.c.v.) injection of mambalgins (10 \u00b5l at 34 \u00b5M), PcTx1 (10 \u00b5l at 10 \u00b5M) or morphine (Cooper, 10 \u00b5l at 3.1 mM), in the absence or in the presence of naloxone (Fluka, 2mg kg -1 ), and after i.pl. injection of mambalgins (10 \u00b5l at 34 \u00b5M) and PcTx1 (10 \u00b5l at 10 \u00b5M). The effects of mambalgins on acute pain were also tested in ASIC1a -/-27 and Penk1 -/-28 mice. Inflammation was evoked by i.pl. 2% carrageenan (Sigma) or 2% formalin. In vivo ASIC1 and ASIC2 gene silencing experiments were carried out by repeated i.t. injections (2 \u00b5g per mouse twice a day for 3 days) of siRNAs targeting ASIC1a+b, ASIC2a+b, or only ASIC2a, mixed with i-Fect (Neuromics) as previously described 4 . a, Black mamba venom (0.1 mg ml -1 ) reversibly inhibits rat ASIC1a current expressed in Xenopus oocytes. b, 3D-model of mambalgin-1 (disulfide bridges in yellow). c, Electrostatic properties of mambalgin-1 and human ASIC1a channel (based on the 3D structure of chicken ASIC1a 29 ) with positive and negative isosurfaces in blue and red, respectively. d,e, Inhibition of rat ASIC channels expressed in COS-7 cells (n=4-15; peptides applied before the pH drop as in a).

                        "A densitometric quantification of the signal shown in b has been done in c and showed a significant reduction of both ASIC1a and ASIC1b expression in COS-7 cells. In vivo siRNA treatment significantly reduced the level of ASIC1 transcripts in lumbar DRGs of ASIC1a -/- mice but did not affect the level of ASIC2 and ASIC3 transcripts (d). Since ASIC1a is lacking in these mice (the ASIC1a mRNA was not detected in similar experimental conditions), the decrease in ASIC1 expression represents the specific knockdown of ASIC1b in lumbar DRGs. e-h, similar experiments performed with a siRNA targeting both ASIC2a and ASIC2b (si-ASIC2a/2b), showing a significant knockdown of the expression of ASIC2a and ASIC2b in COS-7 cells (f,g). In vivo siRNA treatment against ASIC2 in wild-type mice significantly reduced the level of ASIC2 transcripts in the lumbar dorsal spinal cord but did not affect the level of ASIC1 transcripts (h). The ASIC3 mRNA was not detected in similar experimental Mambalgins are able to block all the ASIC channel subtypes expressed in the central nervous system (i.e., ASIC1a, ASIC1a+ASIC2b and ASIC1a+ASIC2a) but the peptides essentially evoke a naloxone-independent effect upon central injection. This suggests that in vivo and at the concentration that has been used, mambalgins only efficiently target the opioidindependent pain pathway involving ASIC1a+ASIC2a channels, but not the opioid-dependent pathway previously associated with ASIC1a and probably ASIC1a+ASIC2b channels and targeted by PcTx1. This is consistent with the fact that the opioid-dependent pathway prevails when PcTx1 and mambalgins are centrally injected together (see supplementary Figure 11).",
                        "In nociceptors, ASIC1b-containing channels, but not ASIC1a, are targeted by mambalgins to evoke analgesia, demonstrating a role for ASIC1b in triggering cutaneous pain."
