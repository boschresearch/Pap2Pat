                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The taking into account and treatment of pain are essential aspects of improving the quality of life of patients. Pain affects a considerable number of individuals, about 60 million in Europe each year, which represents an annual cost of 1 billion dollars in analgesic medicaments for treating said pain. The amounts spent annually throughout the world on analgesic medicaments can be evaluated at approximately 25 billion dollars, and should reach 42 billion in 2010. Pain is divided up into two categories: acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain corresponds to rapid and brief pain which is limited over time. Conversely, chronic pain is a persistent pain which can be linked, for example, to hyperalgesia, and which constitutes an enormous disease burden, affecting approximately 20% of adults and 50% of the elderly population.",
                        "The treatment of pain is based essentially on the prescription of anti-inflammatories, whether they are nonsteroidal (NSAIDs) or steroidal (corticoids), and of weak or strong opiates. NSAIDs form the therapeutic class most widely prescribed throughout the world, owing to their great efficacy both on inflammation and on pain itself. They are used in all types of inflammatory pain, whether acute or chronic [Bertin and Vergne-Salle, 2007] [1]. When NSAIDs and/or corticoids are not sufficient to relieve inflammatory pain, the prescribing physician combines a non-anti-inflammatory analgesic, for example paracetamol, weak opioids (codeine, tramadol), and, if the pain continues to be resistant to the treatment, strong opioids (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl) [Gutstein & Akil, 2006] [2].",
                        "While NSAIDs are very effective, they nevertheless remain great purveyors of adverse side effects. Among the most standard adverse side effects, digestive effects are very frequent and limit the use of NSAIDs in many clinical situations. There are also renal, cutaneous, mucosal, allergic and respiratory, hematological, hepatic and, finally, neurosensory and psychological adverse side effects [Bertin and Vergne-Salle, 2007, mentioned above][1]. In addition, NSAIDs are not effective in all types of pain. Opioids also play a major role in combating pain, but can cause hallucinatory phenomena and cardiorespiratory depression. Analgesics can also be a source of dependence, for instance morphine, methadone, etc., dependence. There are also cases of habituation to analgesics, that is to say the dose necessary to obtain a constant effect must be increased. This habituation increases over time and therefore leads to the need to increase the doses and can lead to ineffectiveness of the medicament. Indeed, the dose necessary to relieve pain can become greater than the toxic dose of said medicament. Finally, treatment with opioids can also be associated with adverse effects such as severe constipation or hyperalgesia when the treatment is stopped (post-operative pain, for example) [Gutstein & Akil, 2006, mentioned above; Bannister & Dickenson, 2010] [2, 3].",
                        "Despite the diversity of the existing therapeutic arsenal, many types of pain remain relatively insensitive to the known analgesics, such as neuropathic pain following damage to the nervous system (50% of patients experience no relief), chronic visceral pain such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel disease, fibromyalgia, pain associated with cancers and bone metastases, etc. [Yennurajalingam et al., 2004; Mizoguchi et al., 2009] [4, 5].",
                        "In this context, the discovery of novel analgesics compensating for these deficiencies and drawbacks and/or novel analgesic targets should therefore represent real progress.",
                        "Research in the pharmaceutical industry on pain has over the past few years resulted only in a few limited developments. Mention may, for example, be made of triptans for migraine and certain novel medicaments of which the use still remains limited, such as the combination of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol for cancer-related and neuropathic pain. In fact, the progress made over the last two decades comes essentially from a better use and adjustments of the dosage of the available analgesics. None of the major families of these analgesics has a benefit/risk ratio which is optimal, because of a limited efficacy and/or considerable side effects.",
                        "Among the molecular targets identified over the past few years, ion channels hold a particularly important place because they are directly involved in the detection and transmission of pain signals by sensory and central neurons. ASIC channels (Acid Sensing Ion Channels) are cationic channels activated by acidification of the extracellular medium (extracellular acidosis) [Waldmann & Lazdunski, 1998; Wemmie et al., 2006; Lingueglia et al., 2007] [6, 7, 8]. Thus far, four genes encoding at least seven subunits (ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC1b2, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3 and ASIC4) have been identified in mammals. Functional ASIC channels result from the association of various ASIC subunits as trimers [Jasti et al. 2007] [9] resulting in homomeric or heteromeric channels [Lingueglia et al., 1997; Benson et al., 2002; Hesselager et al., 2004] [10, 11, 12]. ASIC channels are essentially expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system and in central nervous system neurons [Waldmann et al., 1997a; Lingueglia et al, 2007, mentioned above; Noel et al., 2010] [13, 8, 14]. Although the ASIC1a and ASIC2 isoforms are present in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, the expression of the ASIC1b and ASIC3 isoforms is restricted to sensory neurons [Waldmann et al., 1997b; Bassler et al., 2001; Chen et al., 1998] [15, 16, 17].",
                        "It has been postulated that the ASIC channels expressed by sensory neurons, and in particular the ASIC3 channel, are capable of detecting extracellular acidifications that may develop during ischemia, inflammation, a hematoma, a fracture, a lesion, a surgical procedure (post-operative pain), or the development of certain tumors [Reeh and Steen, 1996] [18]. As it happens, it has been known for several years now that extracellular acidosis causes pain [Steen et al., 1995a; Issberner et al., 1996] [19, 20], and experiments carried out on healthy human volunteers [Ugawa et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2004] [21, 22] have shown the involvement of ASIC channels in acidic skin pain by means of amiloride and certain NSAIDs, which are nonspecific inhibitors of ASIC channels [Waldmann et al., 1997a, mentioned above; Voilley et al., 2001] [13, 23]. The important role of certain ASIC channels expressed in central nervous system neurons in neuronal activity (synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus, of the amygdala) and the neuromodulation of the transmission of pain information (ASIC 1a channels) by spinal cord neurons has also been demonstrated [Noel et al., 2010] [14].",
                        "Until recently, the repertoire of active ligands capable of inhibiting ASIC channels was mainly limited to amiloride, to certain NSAIDs and to the compound A-317567 [Dub\u00e9 et al., 2005] [24]. However, none of these molecules is absolutely specific for ASIC channels or for a particular ASIC subunit. With the aim of identifying effectors specific for ASIC channels, a very large number of scorpion, bee, spider, snake or sea anemone venoms have been screened. Recently, two animal peptide toxins, PcTx1 and APETx2, have been identified which inhibit homomeric ASIC1a channels and the channels containing the ASIC3 subunit, respectively [Escoubas et al., 2000; Diochot et al., 2004] [25, 26]. The peripheral (subcutaneous) injection of APETx2 induces an analgesic effect on inflammatory and acidic pain in rats [Deval et al., 2008] [27] and on post-operative pain in rats after intra-operative application of APETx2 [Deval et al., J. Neurosci., 31(16): 6059-6066, 2011] [36], while the central injection of PcTx1 induces a powerful analgesic effect in mice [Mazzuca et al., 2007] [28]. The analgesic effects of these two toxins have made it possible to demonstrate the involvement in ASIC channels in the perception and transmission of pain information.",
                        "There is therefore a real need to identify other effectors specific for ASIC channels or for a particular ASIC subunit, capable of exhibiting an analgesic effect while at the same time compensating for the deficiencies, drawbacks and obstacles of the prior art analgesics."

                        "The inventors have now discovered and identified, from the venom of the snake Dendroaspis polylepis (black mamba), novel peptides which induce analgesia and which inhibit ASIC channels (Acid Sensing Ion Channels), more specifically homomeric ASIC1a channels, homomeric ASIC1b channels, heteromeric ASIC1a+2a channels and heteromeric ASIC1a+1b channels.",
                        "They are in particular the peptides ASICalgin-1 (\u03c0-Dp1) and ASICalgin-2 (\u03c0-Dp2) which, after central (intrathecal and intracerebroventricular) injection in vivo in mice, exhibit a powerful analgesic effect on different pain modes (chemical, thermal, inflammatory), which is comparable to that of morphine but largely independent of opiate receptor activation. In addition, these peptides do not exhibit neurotoxic effects when they are injected centrally. When administered by subcutaneous peripheral injection, these peptides also exert an analgesic effect with reversion of inflammatory hyperalgesia. These two peptides are the first peptides extracted from the venom of Dendroaspis polylepis (black mamba) to exhibit an analgesic effect.",
                        "Without being limited by this explanation, the most probable mechanism of action of these peptides appears to result from the inhibition of ASIC ion channels which play an important role in the perception, transmission and modulation of pain information. Indeed, these peptides efficaciously inhibit homomeric ASIC1a channels, homomeric ASIC1b channels and/or heteromeric channels containing an ASIC1a and/or ASIC1b subunit of rats and humans. These two peptides are in particular the first known inhibitors of homomeric ASIC1b and ASIC1a channels and heteromeric ASIC1a+ASIC1b and ASIC1a+ASIC2a channels.",
                        "The ASICalgin-1 (\u03c0-Dp1) and ASICalgin-2 (\u03c0-Dp2) peptides also inhibit the native ASIC currents present in sensory neurons and in central neurons. They have no effect on the TRPV1 current activated by capsaicin and by heat and which is itself also involved in pain perception. They do not modify the electrical properties of neurons in the basal state, but reduce neuronal excitability in response to an extracellular acidification capable of activating ASIC channels.",
                        "The ASICalgin-1 (\u03c0-Dp1) and ASICalgin-2 (\u03c0-Dp2) peptides therefore have, in rodents, powerful analgesic properties comparable to those of morphine, which continue to be observed when the opiate receptors are blocked, and which can be explained by their capacity to specifically inhibit certain rodent and human ASIC channels. The central injection of said peptides induces no toxicity (neurotoxicity, convulsions, etc.), nor any effect on motor activity (accelerating rotarod test).",
                        "The ASICalgin-1 (\u03c0-Dp1) and ASICalgin-2 (\u03c0-Dp2) peptides can therefore be envisioned as novel molecules having a therapeutic potential against pain (for example, cancer-related pain, neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, etc.) in humans.",

Thus, the analgesic activity of a peptide according to the invention can be determined, for example, by means of one or more of the following in vivo tests: i) tail/paw withdrawal latency (measurement of thermal nociception) [Abott et al., 1982; Cridland and Henry, 1992] [29, 30], ii) hot/cold plate threshold (measurement of thermal nociception) [Woolfe and Macdonald, 1944, Ankier, 1974] [31, 32], iii) von Frey filament threshold or Randall-Selitto test or instrumented pincher test (mechanical nociceptive activity measurement) [Kim et al., 1993] [33], iv) dynamic weight distribution test (measurement of nociceptive activity linked to posture), v) measurement of spontaneous nociceptive behavior, and/or of one or more in vitro tests: for example, screening of candidate compounds by competition in which a peptide according to the invention which has been labeled (for example, with a radiolabel such as C14, H3 or I125, an enzyme such as peroxidase or alkaline or acid phosphatase, a fluorescent label such as FITC or rhodamine, an antibody, an antigen, biotin, a paramagnetic ion, a latex particle, etc.) is brought into contact with a sample under conditions which allow it to bind to said sample, and the binding of said labeled peptide bound to the sample is measured, and in which the compounds which mimic the activity of said labeled peptide compete with said peptide for binding to the sites on the receptor (ASIC channels containing at least one subunit chosen from the group consisting of the ASIC1a and ASIC1b subunits). Thus, a lower amount of detectable labeling is measured when the test compounds mimic the activity of said peptide by binding to the receptor than when the test compounds do not mimic the activity of said peptide and do not bind the receptor, or bind with less affinity. As an alternative, the competition screening can be carried out with labeling of the candidate compound instead of labeling of the peptide according to the invention. Thus, a higher amount of detectable labeling will be measured when the test compounds mimic the activity of said peptide by binding to the receptor than when the test compounds do not mimic the activity of said peptide and do not bind the receptor, or bind with less affinity.",

The messenger RNA was captured by means of magnetic beads grafted with dT25 oligonucleotides (Dynal, UK). These oligonucleotides were directly used as primers for carrying out the reverse transcription of the mRNA to cDNA with the PrimeScript\u2122 reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan). The resulting solid-phase cDNA library was used to carry out a degenerate PCR with the sense (TGITTYCARCAYGGIAARGT, SEQ ID No: 7) and antisense (YTTIARRTTICGRAAIGGCAT, SEQ ID No: 8) oligonucleotides defined from the partial protein sequence of the toxin determined by direct N-terminal sequencing. In order to exclude any error due to the polymerase, three independent PCRs were carried out, which produced fragments at the hoped for size (89 base pairs), that were subsequently subcloned into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega) and sequenced. By virtue of these sequences, a specific sense oligonucleotide with an added EcoRI restriction site was synthesized (ACAC(GAATTC)GCTATCATAACACTGGCATG, SEQ ID NO: 9), as was a nonspecific poly-dT30 antisense oligonucleotide, also with an added EcoRI site (ACAC(GAATTC)dT30, SEQ ID No: 10). These two oligonucleotides made it possible to amplify by PCR the entire 3\u2032-coding and 3\u2032-noncoding end for identification purposes. Three independent PCRs generated a band of approximately 400 base pairs and the subcloning thereof into the pGEMTeasy vector at the EcoRI restriction site made it possible to sequence it while excluding any error generated by the polymerase.",
