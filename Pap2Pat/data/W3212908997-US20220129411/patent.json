Quantum circuits can be represented by unitary matrices (e.g., a quantum circuit operating on n qubits for any suitable positive integer n can be represented by a 2n\u00d72n unitary matrix). The quantum state of a set of qubits can be represented by a quantum state vector (e.g., for n qubits, a quantum state vector can have 2n elements), and quantum circuits can be applied to a quantum state vector via matrix multiplication. Quantum circuits can be combined in series via matrix multiplication and/or can be combined in parallel via tensor products (e.g., Kronecker products).",
                        "The long-term success of quantum computing depends on achieving at least partial fault-tolerance. Clifford circuits are a particular type of quantum circuit that are integral to fault-tolerant quantum computation (e.g., after all, the encoding circuits for many quantum error-correcting codes are Clifford circuits). Because Clifford circuits can be so useful in quantum computing, synthesis of optimized Clifford circuits implementing a given Clifford operator can be desired. Optimization of a Clifford circuit aims to reduce the single-qubit and/or two-qubit gate count in the Clifford circuit so that the computation time and/or computational resources needed to execute the Clifford circuit can be reduced.",
                        "Much study has been performed on the synthesis of asymptotically optimized Clifford circuits (e.g., Clifford circuits that are optimal up to a constant factor, and thus that are not exactly optimal). Conventionally, synthesis of exactly optimized Clifford circuits is prohibitively expensive even for small numbers of qubits (e.g., conventional techniques can generate exactly optimized Clifford circuits only for up to four qubits, and can generate optimized Clifford circuits up to input/output permutations for up to five qubits). Conventional techniques for optimizing Clifford circuits include template matching and peephole optimization. Template matching involves leveraging templates (e.g., a string of gates known to equate to identity) to reduce gate counts in a given circuit. Conventional template matching is a general technique that works with Clifford circuits and non-Clifford circuits alike. Thus, conventional template matching does not leverage and/or make use of the particular structural characteristics of Clifford circuits, and this limits the extent to which the circuits can be optimized. Peephole optimization involves identifying a subcircuit in an overall Clifford circuit and utilizing a library of known optimal circuits to optimize the subcircuit. A technical problem with conventional peephole optimization is that it requires the subcircuit to be completely isolated from the rest of the Clifford circuit. In other words, if the subcircuit contains entangling gates that link the subcircuit to the rest of the circuit, conventional peephole optimization cannot be used.",

Circuit optimization using template matching is an iterative procedure where, at each step, the optimization starts with a given gate in the circuit and it is attempted to match a given template as far backward and/or forward as possible. If the matched gates can be moved together and the substitution is beneficial, the template can be applied as defined above. However, if the matched gates cannot be moved together and/or cannot otherwise be made consecutive, the template cannot be applied. If the matched gates are not consecutive, it can be said that there is at least one blocking gate between the matched gates. Equivalently, it can be said that there is at least one blocking gate in the template matching range. In various cases, the step can be repeated for all templates and/or for all gates in the circuit, until a predetermined convergence criterion (e.g., any suitable predefined convergence criterion) is satisfied. The result can be that the circuit gate count is reduced (e.g., optimized).",

Thus, although conventional template matching is applicable to Clifford circuits, it does not utilize the specific properties of Clifford circuits for optimization. As explained herein, the inventors of various embodiments of the invention devised a technique for improving template matching (e.g., making template matching more efficient) that functions by exploiting the particular structure of Clifford circuits.",
                        "Next, consider peephole optimization. Similarly to template matching, peephole optimization is an iterative procedure that optimizes a circuit by considering subcircuits on a small subset of qubits, which small subset of qubits can be called A, and attempting to replace such subcircuits with an optimized version from a database/library of precomputed optimal circuits. At each step, for a given gate, all subcircuits on a fixed small number of qubits (e.g., |A|=4) including that gate are considered. For each subcircuit, its cost can be computed and the optimal cost of the unitary implemented by it can be computed (e.g., this optimal cost can be retrieved from the database of precomputed optimal circuits). If a substitution is beneficial, the subcircuit is replaced with the optimal implementation. The step can be repeated for all gates until any suitable predetermined convergence criterion is satisfied.",
                        "As explained above, such conventional peephole optimization works only if the subcircuit is completely decoupled from the rest of the circuit (e.g., the subcircuit cannot include any straddling two-qubit gates that couple the subcircuit to the rest of the circuit). As explained herein, the inventors of various embodiments of the invention devised a technique for enabling peephole optimization to be performed on a subcircuit even when the subcircuit is not fully decoupled from the rest of the circuit.",
                        "Various embodiments of the invention can address one or more of these technical problems. Specifically, various embodiments of the invention can provide systems and/or techniques that can facilitate partitioned template matching and/or symbolic peephole optimization, which can optimize Clifford circuits more efficiently than conventional template matching and/or conventional peephole optimization. In various aspects, the teachings described herein can amount to a heuristic approach to Clifford circuit optimization which can bridge the gap between non-scalable methods for the synthesis of exactly optimized Clifford circuits and the suboptimal (albeit asymptotically-optimal) inexpensive synthesis techniques. In various instances, embodiments of the invention can be considered as a computer-implemented tool (e.g., a computer-implemented software program) that can receive as input suboptimal Clifford circuits and that can produce as output optimized versions of those suboptimal Clifford circuits more efficiently and/or effectively than can conventional systems and/or techniques.",
                        "In various aspects, such a computer-implemented tool can apply partitioned template matching to an inputted Clifford circuit, which can be considered as an improved version of template matching that leverages/utilizes the unique properties/structures of Clifford circuits. Specifically, partitioned template matching leverages the observation that, in Clifford circuits, Pauli gates can always be \u201cpushed\u201d to the end of the circuit (e.g., via the Pauli-push equations explained above) without changing the non-Pauli Clifford gates (e.g., H, S, CNOT). In various aspects, partitioned template matching can include three steps. First, the Clifford circuit can be partitioned into a computation stage, a Pauli stage, and a SWAP stage by \u201cpushing\u201d any Pauli gates and any SWAP gates in the Clifford circuit to the end of the Clifford circuit (those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that SWAP gates can be \u201cpushed\u201d through Clifford circuits in the same and/or similar way as Pauli gates can be \u201cpushed\u201d through Clifford circuits). In various cases, the computation stage can include only H gates, S gates, and CNOT gates, the Pauli stage can include only Pauli gates, and the SWAP stage can include only SWAP gates. Second, template matching can be applied to the computation stage so as to reduce gate count (e.g., it can be easier to apply templates since the Paulis and SWAPs are pushed to the end of the circuit during the partitioning; in other words, the Paulis and the SWAPS are factored out of the computation stage). Third, the SWAP stage can be optimized by leveraging the fact that a SWAP gate can be implemented at the effective cost of one two-qubit gate if the SWAP gate can be \u201caligned\u201d with another two-qubit gate. In some cases, if the application of templates or SWAP optimization yields any Pauli gates in the computation stage, such Pauli gates can be pushed through to the Pauli stage (e.g., the circuit can be re-partitioned). In some aspects, the application of a template to the computation stage can be prevented by a blocking gate. As explained herein, the inventors devised a novel floating-gates technique that can remove the blocking gate, thus allowing application of the template. In other words, the inventors devised a procedure that enables application of templates to sequences of non-consecutive gates that cannot be moved together directly. Such procedure attempts to move (e.g., \u201cfloat\u201d) out single-qubit gates that block the application of a template by decomposing such single-qubit gates into linear combinations of Pauli operators and \u201cpushing\u201d the Pauli operators until they can be combined back into a single-qubit gate that is no longer blocking the application of the template.",
                        "In other words, while conventional template matching simply applies templates to a given Clifford circuit directly, partitioned template matching can include: (1) partitioning the given Clifford circuit into three stages (e.g., computation, Pauli, and SWAP) by \u201cpushing\u201d any Pauli gates and/or SWAP gates in the given Clifford circuit to an end of the given Clifford circuit; (2) applying templates to one of the three partitions (e.g., the computation stage); and (3) implementing SWAP optimization by aligning SWAPs with two-qubit gates. As also mentioned above, various embodiments of the invention can implement a floating-gates technique that can enable a template to be applied to non-consecutive sequences of gates. As explained herein, the floating-gates technique can involve rewriting a blocking gate as a linear combination of Paulis, and then \u201cpushing\u201d the Paulis out of a desired template matching range, thereby allowing application of the desired template. Conventional template matching simply includes neither such partitioning nor such a floating-gate technique.",
                        "In various instances, a computer-implemented tool in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can apply symbolic peephole optimization to a given circuit, which can be considered as an improved version of peephole optimization that can function even without complete subcircuit decoupling. Specifically, when considering a subcircuit that is coupled/entangled to the rest of the circuit by a straddling gate, such straddling gate can be rewritten so that a target of the straddling gate is in the subcircuit (e.g., this can usually be done by the application of various Hadamard gates and/or Phase gates), and the rewritten straddling gate can then be replaced and/or represented by a symbolic Pauli gate as defined herein. As explained below, a symbolic Pauli gate is a Pauli gate that is controlled by a symbolic variable rather than by another qubit. It can be obtained from a two-qubit gate by removing the control and replacing the target with a Pauli gate as desired. Thus, a symbolic Pauli gate can be treated as a single-qubit gate. The subcircuit having the symbolic Pauli gate can then be optimized using dynamic programming and/or a library of precomputed optimal circuits. That is, when symbolic Pauli gates are implemented, the subcircuit can effectively be treated as if it is fully decoupled from the rest of the circuit notwithstanding the fact that the subcircuit is not fully decoupled from the rest of the circuit.",

Further, some of the processes performed can be performed by a specialized computer (e.g., performing, by a device operatively coupled to a processor, template matching on a Clifford circuit associated with a set of qubits; partitioning, by the device and prior to the template matching, the Clifford circuit into a computation stage, a Pauli stage, and a SWAP stage, wherein the template matching is performed on the computation stage; pushing, by the device, a blocking gate out of a template matching range in the computation stage by replacing the blocking gate with a linear combination of Pauli operators; selecting, by the device, a subset of qubits from the set of qubits; rewiring, by the device, at least one entangling gate in the computation stage such that a target of the at least one entangling gate is in the subset of qubits; replacing, by the device, the at least one rewired entangling gate with a symbolic Pauli gate, wherein the symbolic Pauli gate is a Pauli gate that is controlled by a symbolic variable; and performing, by the device, peephole optimization on the subset of qubits with the symbolic Pauli gate). Such defined tasks are not typically performed manually by humans.

More specifically, such a computerized tool can facilitate such optimization by implementing partitioned template matching (as opposed to conventional template matching) and by implementing symbolic peephole optimization (as opposed to conventional peephole optimization). The electronic generation of optimized Clifford circuits is certainly a useful and practical application of computers, especially in view of how important Clifford circuits are to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, as mentioned above, various embodiments of the invention can solve/address some technical problems experienced by conventional techniques. Specifically, conventional template matching is a generic procedure, but partitioned template matching can be considered as a Clifford-specific version of template matching that optimizes Clifford circuits more efficiently than conventional template matching allows. Additionally, conventional peephole optimization does not work if the subcircuit under consideration is not fully decoupled from the rest of the circuit (e.g., does not work if there is a straddling gate), but symbolic peephole optimization can be considered as an improved version of peephole optimization that works notwithstanding the absence of full decoupling.

In various instances, a template can be any suitable string of quantum gates that implements and/or is equivalent to the identity transformation. In various cases, the template component 114 can facilitate template matching on the computation stage of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104 by leveraging the library of templates. In other words, the template component 114 can apply one or more templates from the library of templates to the computation stage of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104 in order to reduce the gate count of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104. Note that, in some cases, application of templates to the computation stage can be easier and/or more efficient/effective than can application of templates to an unpartitioned version of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104. That is, because all the Pauli gates and/or SWAP gates in the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104 are \u201cpushed\u201d toward an end of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104 by the partition component 112, those Pauli gates and/or SWAP gates are no longer present in the computation stage and thus cannot block and/or otherwise impede the application of templates to the computation stage (e.g., without partitioning, the Pauli gates and/or SWAP gates could possibly be located in the middle of a template matching range, which could thus block/prevent the application of a template).",

Conventionally, nothing is done, and a different template is tried. However, in various aspects, the floating component 116 can solve this problem. Specifically, in various instances, the floating component 116 can utilize the floating-gate conversion rules to rewrite and/or convert the blocking gate into a linear combination of Pauli gates (e.g., H can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli gates, and S can be expressed as a linear combination of Pauli gates). Then, the floating component 116 can \u201cpush\u201d the linear combination of Pauli gates, via the Pauli-push equations, out of the template matching range. Accordingly, the blocking gate is removed from the matching range and the template can be applied. In some cases, the floating component 116 can utilize the floating-gate conversion rules to covert the moved linear combination of Pauli operators back into a single-qubit gate.

In various aspects, the symbolic component 120 can perform various actions that can prepare the partitioned and template-matched version of the suboptimal Clifford circuit 104 for peephole optimization. Specifically, the symbolic component 120 can select any suitable subcircuit within the computation stage (e.g., a subcircuit that operates on two qubits and/or three qubits). In various instances, the symbolic component 120 can then rewrite any straddling gates such that their targets are in and/or operated on by the subcircuit. In various cases, a straddling gate can be a two-qubit gate (e.g., CNOT and/or CZ) that has exactly one of a target qubit or a control qubit in the subcircuit. If the target qubit of the straddling gate is in and/or operated on by the subcircuit, then the control qubit of the straddling gate is in and/or operated on by the rest of the circuit. On the other hand, if the control qubit of the straddling gate is in and/or operated on by the subcircuit, then the target qubit of the straddling gate is in and/or operated on by the rest of the circuit. Thus, a straddling gate couples the subcircuit to the rest of the circuit. In various aspects, the symbolic component 120 can utilize any suitable mathematical equations/formulas to rewire a straddling gate such that the target qubit of the straddling gate is in the subcircuit. In various instances, the symbolic component 120 can then replace the rewired straddling gate in the subcircuit with a symbolic Pauli gate. Like an entangling gate (e.g., CNOT and/or CZ), a symbolic Pauli gate can be a controlled Pauli gate (e.g., X, Y, and/or Z). However, unlike an entangling gate, a symbolic Pauli gate can be controlled by a symbolic variable rather than by another qubit. In various aspects, the value of the symbolic variable can be 0 or 1, and the symbolic variable can be an exponent of the symbolic Pauli gate. Thus, if the symbolic variable has a value of 1, the symbolic Pauli gate can implement the underlying Pauli. However, if the symbolic variable has a value of 0, the symbolic Pauli gate can instead implement the identity transformation. In this way, the symbolic Pauli gate can mimic the behavior of a controlled Pauli (e.g., CNOT and/or CZ), but can be treated as a single-qubit gate (e.g., can be treated as a non-entangling gate) for peephole optimization purposes.",

As explained above, template matching can involve matching a subsequence of gates in a template to a corresponding subsequence of gates in the circuit. As long as the corresponding subsequence of gates in the circuit are consecutive (e.g., as long as there is no blocking gate in the template matching range), the subsequence of gates in the circuit can be replaced with the inverses of the remaining gates in the template, which can thus reduce the gate count of the circuit.

FIG. 10 illustrates exemplary and non-limiting templates that can be used for Hadamard and Phase \u201cpushing.\u201d Consider template (a) in FIG. 10.

Note that if the circuit is already optimized in terms of two-qubit gate count, template matching can be applied to single-qubit gate count reduction specifically by restricting the templates used to a subset that can reduce single-qubit gate count without also reducing the two-qubit gate count. Such a subset of templates can include single-qubit templates and templates with an even number of two-qubit gates when applied to replace half the entangling gates with the rest.",

At this point, the floating component 116 can convert O1 and O2 back to a single-qubit gate based on the rules specified in table 1202 and table 1204 of FIG. 12. More specifically, the table 1202 can specify the rules for converting a floating Phase gate into a one-qubit gate, based on the final values of O1 and O2 (e.g., an S gate can be converted into a linear combination of Paulis by the above equations, the linear combination of Paulis can be \u201cpushed\u201d via the Pauli-push equations such that the linear combination of Paulis is outside of the template matching range and is acting on one qubit, and then the pushed linear combination of Paulis can be replaced with the results shown in table 1202 depending on the values of the pushed linear combination of Paulis). Similarly, table 1204 can specify the rules for converting a floating Hadamard gate into a one-qubit gate, based on the final values of O1 and O2 (e.g., an H gate can be converted into a linear combination of Paulis by the above equations, the linear combination of Paulis can be \u201cpushed\u201d via the Pauli-push equations such that the linear combination of Paulis is outside of the template matching range and is acting on one qubit, and then the pushed linear combination of Paulis can be replaced with the results shown in table 1204 depending on the values of the pushed linear combination of Paulis).

From these observations and since the conversion is only defined up to global phase, the tables 1202 and 1204 can be considered as exhaustive. In various aspects, the floating gate conversion rules 1102 can include the tables 1202 and 1204, thus allowing the floating component 116 to convert floating Phase gates and floating Hadamard gates back into single-qubit gates.",

                        "As shown, FIG. 13 depicts an exemplary, non-limiting template 1302 and an exemplary, non-limiting circuit 1304. Note that the template 1302 can be equivalent to the template (e) of FIG. 9. As can be seen, the first three gates (e.g., CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2, with ordering of qubits from top to bottom) of the template 1302 are matched in the circuit 1304 (e.g., the circuit 1304 also has CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2 in that order). Thus, the circuit 1304 can potentially be optimized by the template 1302. However, the template 1302 cannot be directly applied to the circuit 1304 due to the S gate that is in between the CNOT2,1 and the CNOT3,1 of the circuit 1304. In such case, the S gate can be considered as a blocking gate (e.g., the S gate is in between the matched gates in the circuit 1304, such that the matched gates in the circuit 1304 are not consecutive; equivalently, it can be said that the S gate is in the template matching range). Conventional template matching offers no solution for this problem; instead, a different template would be tried. However, the floating component 116 can solve this issue. Specifically, the floating component 116 can convert the S gate (e.g., a non-limiting example of a blocking gate) into a linear combination of Pauli operators according to the above equations (e.g., according to the floating gate conversion rules 1102). The floating component 116 can then independently push the linear combination of Pauli operators, via the Pauli-push equations, out of the template matching range (e.g., so that the S gate is no longer in between the CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2) and can continue such pushing until the linear combination of Pauli operators are single-qubit gates acting on the same qubit. At such point, the floating component 116 can use the floating gate conversion rules 1102 (e.g., the table 1202 since an S gate is being floated in this example) to convert the moved linear combination of Pauli operators back into a single-qubit gate. The circuit 1306 can be the result of floating the S gate of the circuit 1304 in this way. As shown in the circuit 1306, the CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2 are now consecutive, which allows application of the template 1302. Note that in this case, the floating S gate can have to be moved past the fourth gate (e.g., CNOT1,3), since floating the S gate only past CNOT3,1 and CNOT3,2 in this example does not result in a one-qubit gate (e.g., again, those ordinary skill in the art will appreciate how to perform such floating via the Pauli-push equations). In various aspects, since the matched gates (e.g., CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2) are consecutive in the circuit 1306, the template 1302 can be applied to reduce the gate count. That is, the matched gates (e.g., CNOT2,1, CNOT3,1, and CNOT3,2) in the circuit 1306 can be replaced with the inversion of the remaining gates in the template 1302. The result can be the optimized circuit 1308, which can have a lower gate count than the circuit 1304 as shown.",

Those circuits were recompiled using the baseline compiler, and then optimization (e.g., partitioned template matching and symbolic peephole optimization) was performed. The inventors found that the introduction of the floating gates technique resulted in an average improvement in two-qubit gate count of about 2.6% due to the additional template applications that were enabled by the floating gates technique. Moreover, average improvements of 64.5% over reference circuits and 35.4% over circuits synthesized using the baseline compiler were achieved.

Specifically, partitioned template matching can include partitioning a Clifford circuit into three distinct stages (e.g., computation, Pauli, and SWAP), performing template matching on one of those distinct stages (e.g., computation), and eliminating SWAP gates via alignment with other two-qubit gates. Moreover, various embodiments of the invention can include a floating gates technique that can be used to remove blocking gates from desired template matching ranges. Symbolic peephole optimization can be considered as an improved version of peephole optimization which does not require complete decoupling to function. Specifically, symbolic peephole optimization can include identifying a desired subcircuit, rewiring any straddling gates such that their targets are in the subcircuit, and then replacing the rewired straddling gates with symbolic Pauli gates that are controlled by symbolic variables rather than by other qubits.",
