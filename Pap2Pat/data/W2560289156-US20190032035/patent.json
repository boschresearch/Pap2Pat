                        "One of the basic tools of molecular biology are proteins with a clearly defined activity, used, for example, in genetic engineering, diagnostics, medicine and industry for manufacturing and processing various products. One example of such enzymes are DNA endonucleases, also referred to as restriction enzymes, which recognize and cleave specific sequences of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA).",
                        "Ribonucleases (RNases) are counterparts of DNA restriction enzymes, and they play an important role in the processing and degradation of RNA in cells by taking part in various biochemical reactions based on exo- or endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA molecules. Exoribonucleases degrade",
                        "RNA molecules in a sequence-independent manner, starting from their ends, while endoribonucleases (endoRNases) cleave single- or double-stranded RNA molecules (ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively) inside. Although many RNases show substrate specificity, their target sequence is usually limited to one or few nucleotides in ssRNA, very often in a context of a particular secondary and tertiary structure of the whole molecule. One of such enzymes is the phage protein RegB, which cleaves the GGAG sequence in the middle. To cleave efficiently, RegB requires additional determinants, such as a proper RNA secondary structure and enzyme interaction with a ribosomal protein S1 (Lebars, I., et al., J Biol Chem, (2001) 276, 13264-13272, and Saida, F., et al., (2003) Nucleic Acids Res, 31, 2751-2758.).",
                        "There are other sequence-specific ribonucleases known, but they are unsuitable for engineering due to the fact that, in addition to a suitable nucleotide sequence, a unique structure formed by a particular ssRNA fragment is required. There have been attempts to change the substrate specificity of T1 and MC1 RNases (Hoschler, K., et al., J Mol Biol, (1999) 294, 1231-1238, Numata, T., et al., Biochemistry, (2003) 42, 5270-5278). In these two cases, enzyme variants with specificity narrowed from single nucleotide to two nucleotides were produced (Numata, T., et al., Biochemistry, (2003) 42, 5270-5278; Czaja, R., et al., Biochemistry, (2004) 43, 2854-2862; Struhalla, M., et al., Chembiochem, (2004) 5, 200-205). However, low or no specificity towards hydrolysed RNA sequence greatly limits its processing, and hence also the possibility to apply such enzymes.",
                        "Apart from proteins, hammerhead ribozymes, catalytic DNA molecules (DNAzymes), and artificial enzymes based on peptide nucleic acids (PNAzymes) are also used to cleave RNA sequences. Described molecules may be designed to obtain sequence-specific cleavage of RNA molecules. Hammerhead ribozymes are 30-nucleotide RNA molecules initially discovered in plant viruses (Prody, Ga., et al., Science, (1986) 231, 1577-1580). They form three stems, wherein the sequences forming stems I and III bind complementary sequences of substrate RNA molecule flanking the target sequence UH (where H is any nucleotide except G), which is cleaved in the middle. Hammerhead ribozymes may be designed to cleave target sequences in cis or trans conformation (Usman, N., et al., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. (1996) 4, 527-533). DNAzymes are catalytic DNA molecules that have been identified using in vitro selection from random DNA sequences. Thus far, many DNAzymes with a broad range of specificity have been described. Designed Cu2+ dependent PNAzymes also provide a possibility for highly selective cleavage of RNA molecules. They are designed to bind with an RNA complementary sequence and form a bulge of four nucleotides in a target molecule. If the formed bulge comprises the AYRA sequence (where Y=C, U; R=A, G), it can be cleaved by the PNAzyme (Murtola M., et al., J Am Chem Soc (2010) 26, 8984-8990).",
                        "Enzymes with the ability to process dsRNA belong to ribonuclease III superfamily in which four families have been identified: Dicer, Drosha, RNase III, and Mini-III. All proteins classified thereinto are characterized by the catalytic domain of ribonuclease III. Ribonuclease Mini-III from Bacillus stubtilis has a domain of this type, yet it does not have a dsRNA binding domain typical for other known members of ribonuclease III superfamily. Genes encoding Mini-III are present in genomes of Gram-negative bacteria and in plant plastids. In both bacteria and plastids, the Mini-III enzyme is involved in the process of 23S rRNA maturation. A natural substrate for this protein is 23S pre-rRNA in which 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends are cleaved. The sequence cleaved by Mini-III in the natural substrate of 23S pre-rRNA has been determined, and it has been found that close to the cleavage site the 23S pre-rRNA fragment attains a partly double-stranded and partly irregular structure with unpaired single-stranded elements. The studies conducted thus far have suggested that the Mini-III may have predispositions to recognize irregularities in the dsRNA helix structure (Redko, Y., et al., Molecular Microbiology, (2008) 68(5), 1096-1106). The activity of Mini-III towards 23S pre-rRNA is significantly stimulated by L3 protein which acts on the substrate, and not on the enzyme conformation state (Redko, Y. et al., Molecular Microbiology, 2009) 71(5), 1145-1154). It has been shown that in the plastids of plant cells Mini-III regulates the amount of introns and non-coding RNA molecules present in the cell by degradation thereof (Hotto A., et al., Plant Cell, (2015), 27(3), 724-740).",
                        "The inventors' team, for the first time in history, has described the sequence specific activity of RNase towards double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) exhibited by the Mini-III enzyme and its mutant D94R. The reported results confirm the sequence-dependent cleavage of long dsRNA molecules by Mini-III RNase from Bacillus stubtilis (BsMiniIII). The analysis of sites cleaved by this enzyme during limited cleavage of long dsRNA molecules, bacteriophage \u03c66 genome, has led to the identification of a sequence motif in dsRNA cleaved by this enzyme. Moreover, nucleotide residues within the cleavage site have been established which affect the cleaving efficiency and are essential for the enzyme to recognize the dsRNA sequence. Structural studies followed by the computer modelling backed up with suitable experiments, have also shown that the \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop, a structural element characteristic for enzymes belonging to Mini-III RNases, plays a key role in specific activation of the protein, but not in the process of binding dsRNA (Glow D., et al., Nucleic Acids Res, (2015), 43(5), 2864-2873).",
                        "The identification of other RNases exhibiting sequence specificity towards dsRNA and the possibility to change the specificity thereof would enable development in the field of RNA nucleic manipulation techniques, as well as the development of novel research methods and applications with such enzymes, and new technologies using such enzymes.",
                        "Based on the above premises, the aim of the invention is, firstly, to provide dsRNA RNases with high sequence specificity, other than BsMiniIII, recognizing and cleaving a particular sequence in double-stranded RNA, and secondly, in order to change substrate preference and activity thereof, to provide a method based on the exchange of defined structural elements between the enzymes of this endonuclease subfamily. The aim of the invention is also to provide a method of determining, isolating, obtaining, selecting, and preparing such sequence-specific dsRNA RNases.",
                        "While testing the activity and specificity of a set of BsMiniIII homologues, the inventors have unexpectedly found that the enzymes of ribonuclease Mini-III family have different a nucleotide preference during dsRNA cleavage than BsMiniIII. As in the case of BsMiniIII, this preference depends only on the dsRNA sequence and is independent from both an occurrence of irregular helix in dsRNA and cooperation with other proteins. Unexpectedly, the inventors have found that the enzymes of the ribonuclease III superfamily, which in in silico modelling have a loop formed by a polypeptide chain fragment, located in and interacting with the major groove of dsRNA helix, show an activity which allows for specific and defined fragmentation of dsRNA, with properties close to these of restriction enzymes for dsDNA. For the first time, the studies conducted by the inventors have provided evidence for the dependence of cleavage preference on the \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop sequence. Furthermore, the model analysis surprisingly allowed us to find an additional structural element\u2014an \u03b14 helix which, similarly to the mentioned loop, is located suffficently close to the dsRNA sequence and affects the activity and specificity of Mini-III enzymes. The exchange of structural elements between the proteins unexpectedly yielded a change in both specificity and activity of resulting chimeric proteins."

                        "Mini-III RNases exhibiting sequence specificity and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases exhibiting sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention, and the use thereof enable development of a whole new field of RNA manipulation techniques, as well as development of novel research methods and applications of such enzymes and novel technologies utilizing such enzymes. Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and derivatives and/or variants thereof, for example, will be used in ribonucleotide modifications, in structural studies of RNA in order to understand the structure of RNA molecules and/or modifications thereof, in the generation of RNAi molecules, in particular siRNA, in diagnostics and treatment of plant and animal viral diseases, as well as in applications in nanotechnology based on RNA, so-called \u2018RNA tectonics\u2019.",
                        "New Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention will be used in novel biotechnological applications. There have been known enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA in a sequence-dependent manner, yet the activity thereof depends not only on the substrate sequence, but also on its structure, thus they are not very useful in practice. In contrast, new Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention do not have these disadvantages and can be used as laboratory reagents commonly used for dsRNA cleavage, such as restriction enzymes used in molecular biology for dsDNA cleavage. In addition to the in vitro use of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA, there is also a possibility to employ these in medicine, diagnostics and nanotechnology. For example, in structural studies of RNA, direct RNA sequencing by reverse transcription reaction is currently the one most used to identify modifications, or mass spectrometry is used for the same purpose. In both cases the analysis of large RNA molecules (e.g., rRNA or mRNA) is problematic. In these methods, nucleases are used to fragment RNA, the cleavage products being short RNA fragments or ribonucleotides. Such cleavage is unspecific, and the multitude of resulting products makes the interpretation of the obtained results difficult or even impossible. The use of new Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases according to the invention enables cleavage of such RNA molecules into smaller repeatable fragments in a controlled way. Their molar mass and properties may be determined independently, whereby it is possible to perform analyses of ribonucleotide modifications as well as RNA structural studies what thus far has been impossible or very difficult. Such studies of modifications and structures of RNA molecules will provide information on the potential therapeutic targets, like, for example the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. The use of new Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases according to the invention enables development of technologies based on RNAi, short interfering dsRNA molecules. Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention will be used in methods and applications using siRNA or shRNA for gene silencing, used in medicine, for example, to treat cancers, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, one of the strategies which result in obtaining short double-stranded RNA fragments is to treat long dsRNA, obtained from a particular DNA fragment, with ribonuclease III from Escherichia coli. This enzyme cleaves dsRNA non-specifically, producing fragments of 18 to 25 base pairs. Thus obtained short siRNA fragments are used in gene silencing. The use of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases according to the invention gives completely new and unknown possibilities for the production of specific siRNA, enabling the generation of a defined pool of these dsRNA fragments which would most efficiently silence expression of a particular gene, and also would reduce side effects of silencing other genes.",
                        "Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention will be applicable in diagnostics, and also in the treatment of diseases caused by viruses with dsRNA as a genetic information carrier. One example of such viruses is rotaviruses from the Reoviridae family, of which three groups are pathogenic for humans. Currently, to detect and identify these groups, reverse transcription followed by PCR technique is used. The availability of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases according to the invention enables the manipulation of dsRNA, significantly accelerating the diagnostics. Currently, the treatment of rotavirus infections is highly ineffective. Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity, and/or chimeric proteins, and/or derivatives and/or variants of Mini-III RNases showing sequence specificity towards dsRNA according to the invention will be used as means for the treatment of diseases caused by rotaviruses, enabling the specific cleavage of viral genome, and thus preventing further replication thereof.",

                                "As a result of the visual analysis of the model of BsMiniIII with dsRNA dimer complex structure, it was found that two elements of the structure are located close enough to the RNA substrate to participate in the selection of the substrate sequence to cleave, and the differences in the amino acid sequence of these two elements can be responsible for the differences observed among the tested enzymes in preference towards various substrates. Selected structure elements are \u03b14 helix and \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop (FIG. 6). One of the methods for experimental verification of roles played by these structural elements is to test the effect of a change in the amino acid sequence of these Mini-III regions on the preference to cleave different sequences. To establish precisely the functional region, an alignment of amino acid sequences was done for the enzymes described in Example 1. It occurred that although the selected fragments of protein Mini-III amino acid sequences corresponding to \u03b14 helix and \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop are characterized by significant differences on the sequence level, on ends thereof there are similar positions, conserved in the course of evolution. For sequence fragments, intended for the exchange between analysed enzymes, to constitute exact equivalents, the borders thereof were set on positions directly adjacent to conserved positions. For BsMiniIII amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1), these are amino acids 46-52 for \u03b14 helix, and 85-98 for \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop. For CtMiniIII amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 6), these are 56-62 for \u03b14 helix, and 93-106 for \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop. For FpMiniIII amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 8), these are 45-51 for \u03b14 helix, and 82-95 for \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop. For SeMiniIII amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 12), these are 43-49 for \u03b14 helix, and 82-95 for \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop. Both structural elements, with reference to the amino acid sequence of proteins, are marked in FIG. 7. Positions of flanking amino acids are shown in Table 11.",

Sequences of used primers are given in Table 12.",
                                "PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase. Reaction products were treated with phage T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 1 mM ATP in order to phosphorylate DNA 5\u2032-ends, and subsequently, they were combined with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising a sequence encoding the exchanged element derived from a different microorganism (Table 10). In the case of sequences encoding \u03b15b-\u03b16 loop, the insert was obtained by filling in 3\u2032-ends of the hybrid resulting from the renaturation of two oligonucleotides with partly complementary sequences (Table 11).",
                                "Ligation was conducted at room temperature for 1 hour in the presence of 5% PEG 4000 and 5 units of phage T4 DNA ligase. Ligation products were used to transform E. coli Top 10 strain, and then the selection was performed as described in Example 1. The material from single colonies was used in PCR using Taq polymerase and ET-long and ET-reverse primers (Table 12) which amplified the whole insert. Amplification product was subjected to sequencing which enabled the selection of clones with desired insert orientation in relation to vector sequence. Obtained chimeric proteins are listed in the table (Table 13).",

The next step was to measure the initial rate of cleaving the substrates selected from pUC910S substitution variants. The kinetics measurement for the cleavage of these substrates was performed as described in Example 8. The results are shown in FIG. 8. Enzymes Ct(FpH)MiniIII, Ct(FpL)MiniIII, Ct(FpHL)MiniIII, and Bs(FpH)MiniIII, demonstrated increased activity in relation to both initial enzymes forming the chimeric protein (CtMiniIII and FpMiniIII). Enzymes Ct(FpH)MiniIII, Ct(FpL)MiniIII, and Ct(FpHL)MiniIII showed significantly changed sequence preference. While 910S-UGCA substrate is cleaved by wild type CtMiniIII very slowly, chimeric protein Ct(FpL) cleaves this substrate much faster, and chimeric protein Ct(FpH) cleaves this substrate at a rate close to the rate for cleaving 910S-ACCU substrate. In the case of chimeric protein Ct(FpHL), 910S-UGCA substrate is cleaved with efficiency similar to the efficiency of FpMiniIII donor, almost three times faster than the original 910S-ACCU substrate (FIG. 8).",
