    "abstract": "Background To develop and validate a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) based radiomics model for discriminating osteoporosis and osteopenia. Methods A total of 635 patients underwent QCT were retrospectively included from November 2016 to November 2019. The patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis (N = 590) were divided into a training cohort (N = 414) and a test cohort (N = 176). Radiomics features were extracted from the QCT images of the third lumbar vertebra. Minimum redundancy and maximum relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for data dimensional reduction, features selection and radiomics model building. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to construct the combined clinical-radiomic model that incorporated radiomics signatures and clinical characteristics. The performance of the combined clinical-radiomic model was evaluated by the area under the curve of receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC\u2013AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Results The patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis were randomly divided into training and test cohort with a ratio of 7:3. Six more predictive radiomics signatures, age, alkaline phosphatase and homocysteine were selected to construct the combined clinical-radiomic model for diagnosis of osteoporosis and osteopenia. The AUC of the combined clinical-radiomic model was 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95 to 0.98) in the training cohort and 0.96 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.00) in the test cohort, which were superior to the clinical model alone (training-AUC = 0.81, test-AUC = 0.79). The calibration curve demonstrated that the radiomics nomogram had good agreement between prediction and observation and decision curve analysis confirmed clinically useful. Conclusions The combined clinical-radiomic model that incorporates the radiomics score and clinical risk factors, can serve as a reliable and powerful tool for discriminating osteoporosis and osteopenia.",

                "Osteoporosis is a age-related musculoskeletal disease characterized by reduced bone mass and increasing of bone fragility and fracture susceptibility [1]. Obviously, aging of population is becoming more severe and it has been estimated about 6 million fragility fractures will occur in China by 2050 [2]. Early screening and intervention\u00a0will effectively slow down the development of\u00a0bone resorption and reduce the risk for initial or subsequent fractures [3].",
                "Dual energy X-ray (DXA) is currently widely used for diagnosis of osteoporosis, but it may be interfered by vascular calcification, osteophyte, and body position. Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is also an imaging technique based on radiation absorption to measure volumetric density, which can assess cortical and trabecular bone compartments separately [4]. The changes of bone mineral density (BMD)measured by QCT are more sensitive to age-related or treatment-related than that measured by DXA for the whole vertebral body [4].",
                "Since radiomics [5\u20139] was proposed in 2012, a high-throughput approach of mining-specific image characteristics from standard medical images, which has drawn increasing attentions. It extracts a large number of features and applies them to the clinical decision support systems to improve the accuracy of qualitative evaluation and prognosis of lesions. Radiomics has been successfully applied in prediction and differentiation of disease outcome in high-risk prostate cancer [10], bone mineral loss [11], osteopenia and osteoporosis for X-ray [12], osteoporosis prediction [13] and types of multiple myeloma [5]. Tagliafico AS et al. [5] was the first study bringing radiomics signatures into musculoskeletal system to differentiate bone tissue into focal and diffuse pattern of multiple myeloma, and their model validation effective rates were 73\u201371%, respectively.",
                "Therefore, our study aimed to establish and validate a nomogram radiomics model that incorporated both the radiomics signatures based on QCT images and clinic risk factors to evaluate osteoporosis and osteopenia for individual pre-treatment."

In comparison to BMD obtained by QCT, bone microstructure parameters brings additional and complementary information to improve the prediction of fracture risk [17, 18]. As a new technology, radiomics can produce many features that reflect the microstructure of images. Some studies have shown that there is a certain correlation between the texture parameters of cancellous bone extracted from radiological images and bone microstructure [19, 20]. He et al. have established a radiomics model based on MRI for the diagnosis of osteoporosis [21]. In our study, the model based on QCT images and clinical data can quantify the information of higher dimensions of vertebral body to a certain extent, which is comprehensively analyze the changes of bone structure and bone mineral density, and has certain application value for the evaluation of osteoporosis.",

Then, LASSO approach was used to reduce the regression coefficient, extract 6 features with high performance of discrimination for osteoporosis and osteopenia to establish rad-score. Signatures extracted from LASSO were considerable accurately and the regression coefficients of most signatures were reduced toward zero during overfitting [22], making the model easier to construe and available to identify the top ranking signatures [23]. Compared to the clinical predictors alone (training-AUC\u2009=\u20090.81, test-AUC\u2009=\u20090.79), the combined model showed significant improvement (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96).",

Several studies has confirmed that [26\u201328] the lumbar spine is the good observation site for bone loss in all skeletal structures, among long bone backbone, femoral neck, and spinal segment [29, 30]. Among the lumbar vertebrae, the L3 has the highest specificity [26], because L3 is found to be the vertebral body with the highest bone metabolism rate and the lowest bone density in all vertebral bodies. In our study, the L3 was used to extract radiomics signatures, and it was proved that the extracted signatures could significantly discriminate the osteoporosis and osteopenia (AUC\u2009=\u20090.96). In comparison, some studies developed a predictive model for BMD based on hip BMD [31], lumbar and hip BMD [32] or unspecified [33]. The delineation of ROI is the most important part in the analysis of radiomics, because the subsequent data is generated by the delineated area, and the gray scale of cancellous bone and cortical bone is clear and easy to distinguish.",
                "The 6 more predictive radiomics signatures mainly concluded wavelet_LLH features, which had been proved having high discriminating and predictable performance of model verification, especially in distant metastases of lung cancer [34] and improvement of radiomics reproducibility for pulmonary nodules or masses [35]. In these 6 features, 2 were the wavelet_LLL features, 3 were wavelet_LLH features and 1 was original feature. In addition, features include both first-order features and grayscale features. Wavelet features could reflect the spatial heterogeneity of vertebral body synthetically cause they contain high-order image [36]. Studies have shown that both skewness and glrlm can reflect the heterogeneity of regions of interest [37\u201339]. Our analysis demonstrated that the 6 radiomics features had a strong discrimination ability to evaluate osteoporosis and osteopenia. Previous studies [40\u201342] proposed that age, gender, Hb, UA, Hcy, ALP, Ca, are related with osteoporosis, but the correlations are weakly positive compared to BMD [40]. In our study, the specific clinical predictors performed a training AUC of 0.81 and a test AUC of 0.79. Therefore, our results showed that adding the rad-score to the model can improve the performance of clinical nomogram (training-AUC\u2009=\u20090.96, test-AUC\u2009=\u20090.96). This finding may support multi-dimension data is most effectively way to construct clinical decision model. However, some studies only use clinical data to diagnose osteoporosis [43, 44]. There are several limitations in our study. First, this study was derived from single center and there is no external data, so its performance evaluation may be overly optimistic. Second, the follow-up data like therapeutic response and fracture rate was not considered currently.",
                "In summary, a rad-score derived from QCT images was proposed in this study, which was an independent risk factor for abnormal BMD patients. In addition, diagnostic nomograms combining rad-score and clinical predictors provided a convenient way to discriminate osteoporosis and osteopenia and may influence decision-making on the possible benefit of treatment."
