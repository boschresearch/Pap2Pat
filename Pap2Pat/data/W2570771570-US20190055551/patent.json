                        "One obstacle to using RNA nanomotifs such as pRNA 3WJs as building blocks in the rational design of diagnostics and therapeutics has been their characteristic low stability. Disclosed herein are novel trifurcate pRNA 3WJ motifs and methods of their use to construct compounds which can be used in therapeutic and biotechnology applications, including, but not limited to, therapeutic delivery, diagnosis of diseases, promotion of RNA crystallization, or creation of stable RNA aptamers. The stability of the novel 3WJs contributes to the self-assembly properties of pRNA. Thus pRNA 3WJ motifs disclosed herein indicate new scaffolds for pRNA-based nanotechnology.",

The results, discussed further below, show that certain 3WJs such as the GA1, SF5, and M2 pRNA 3WJs described herein have greater thermodynamic stability than the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ commonly used as a scaffold in RNA-based nanotechnology. Furthermore, certain deletions in the phi29 pRNA 3WJ are shown to increase its stability relative to the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ.

Thus, the described deletion mutant constructs can be used as more robust alternatives to current technologies that utilize the WT phi29 pRNA 3WJ stem as a building block for polyvalent, nanoscale delivery systems. The presently disclosed novel pRNA 3WJ constructs have at least one use as an improved drug delivery scaffold due to their enhanced stability over currently used technologies, such as the previously noted WT phi29 pRNA 3WJ motif. Functional RNAs designed using the enhanced stability phi29 pRNA 3WJ deletion mutants disclosed herein or M2, SF5, or GA1 pRNA 3WJs disclosed herein include but are not limited to: therapeutic delivery vehicles to carry various therapeutic, targeting, or diagnostic molecules, including but not limited to siRNAs, ribozymes, riboswitches, aptamers, and antisense RNA, and linkers for connecting such therapeutic, targeting, or diagnostic molecules, such as but not limited to those shown in U.S. Pat.

Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a method used to screen for aptamers having desired binding specificities, from randomized RNA pools developed in vitro. Using this technique, various aptamers can be selected for targeting markers relevant to diseases.",

Among the advantages of the compounds, compositions and methods as disclosed herein, e.g., for RNA nanomedicine, there are included the attributes of self-assembly, high physicochemical and physiological stability, multi-valency, targeted delivery, protein-free (including advantages associated with being non-immunogenic, non-inflammatory, non-toxic, non-eliciting of lymphokine, chemokine or cytokine responses such as an interferon response), nanoscale size, controlled synthesis with defined structure and stoichiometry, combining therapy and detection of therapy effects into one particle.",
                        "In non-limiting embodiments, each branch of the 3WJ scaffold may be separately functionalized to carry different therapeutic payloads, reporters and/or targeting ligands thereby forming a multivalent compound. Targeted compounds enable cell-type-specific delivery resulting in a lower concentration of the drug to be administered, thus reducing the side effects. The multivalent approach permits certain embodiments to comprise a mixture of therapeutic agents (e.g., different drugs delivered via a different subunit that may be assembled into the 3WJ nanoparticle complexes assembled herein) thereby producing a synergistic effect. The multi-valency offers an additional advantage in these and/or other contemplated embodiments that permit therapy along with detection of therapeutic effects, combined into one nanoparticle that is introduced in a single administration.",

In non-limiting embodiments, particles ranging from 10-50 nm are suitable as they are large enough to be retained by the body yet small enough to pass through the cell membrane via the cell surface receptor mediated endocytosis. The herein described nanoparticle delivery thus improves the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, and safety of therapeutic and/or diagnostic agents. Additionally, the protein-free nature of the presently disclosed therapeutic compounds result in these nanoparticles being substantially non-immunogenic; by avoiding the induction of antibodies in a recipient, these embodiments permit safely the repeated administration of the nanoparticles for the treatment of chronic diseases including cancers, viral infections, and genetic ailments.",

                                "The pRNA 3WJ can be assembled from three RNA oligomers mixed in approximately equimolar concentrations. The pRNA constructs investigated in this study were assembled from three RNA strands designated 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc (FIG. 1A-B). Constructs were designed to encompass the central 3WJ region of folded pRNA, not including the A, CE, and D bulges (FIG. 1A), to form three helices of approximately equal free energies. The pRNA 3WJ constructs utilized herein retained substantial sequence identity to the wild types at the 3WJ \u201ccore\u201d, and included changes distal to the 3WJ \u201ccore\u201d in certain constructs (e.g., FIGS. 2-3) to ensure that the free energy of helix formation for each branch was within 0.1 kcal/mol. The three oligonucleotide sequences for each 3WJ construct are shown in Table 1. The predicted free energy for each branch duplex includes a helix initiation term that assumes two strands come together independently. This is an overestimation of the penalty of helix formation in the third branch formed because this branch should not have the same entropic penalty in the 3WJ. Thus, the calculated 3WJ free energies shown below (e.g., Table 2) actually underestimate the stabilities of the 3WJs. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purity was confirmed to be >95% by 32P labeling and gel electrophoresis.",

                                "For each 3WJ construct, the three RNA oligomers 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc were mixed in approximately equimolar concentrations spanning a 100-fold dilution range from 0.4 \u03bcM to 40 \u03bcM. UV optical melting was performed as described previously (Schroeder and Turner 2009), with variation in the analysis for a three-component RNA system. Briefly, melts were carried out under standard melt buffer conditions (1 M sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium cacodylate, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) (Gu et al. 2013) using a Beckman Coulter DU-800 spectrophotometer. Absorbances at 260 and 280 nm were measured as a function of temperature from 4\u00b0 C. to 90\u00b0 C., both the largest measurable temperature range and the range for which the midpoint and the constructs' expected Tms were approximately equal. In order to form reproducibly the lowest energy structure, RNA samples were heated to 90\u00b0 C. and slowly cooled prior to melting or the addition of magnesium. The sodium chloride concentration was reduced by an order of magnitude for melts with 10 mM metal ions, but all other conditions remained the same. Due to the presence of EDTA, the effective Mg2+ concentration may have been slightly less than 10 mM. For each construct, optical melts of single RNA strands 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc and all pairwise combinations were also performed. Melt curves were fit using Meltwin in order to determine melting temperatures, and thermodynamic parameters were determined from van't Hoff plots where the equilibrium constant Keq was given by Eq. 1:",

The sharpness of the melting transition and the linearity of the van't Hoff plots suggest two-state melting; however, the assumption of \u0394Cp=0 is not rigorously followed. Although the enthalpies show some temperature dependence, there is a large range of error in the enthalpy and heat capacity values. The errors in enthalpy and entropy are correlated, and thus, the free energy still provides a useful, predictive value. Furthermore, corrections for temperature-dependent changes in heat capacity have a small effect within error of the value for the final free energy of the multibranch loop motif, i.e., <0.5 kcal/mol. Thermodynamic stabilities of the pRNA 3WJ nanomotifs were calculated by subtracting the stability contributions of the RNA helices as calculated from the Nearest Neighbor Database (Table 2, FIGS. 6A-6B).\n\npRNA 3WJ Secondary Structure and Free Energy Predictions",
                                "The secondary structure and stability of each pRNA construct was predicted using four RNA secondary structure prediction programs: RNA Structure, RNAfold, mfold, and RNAsoft. For predictions in RNA Structure, RNAfold, and mfold, pRNA strands 3WJa and 3WJb as well as 3WJb and 3WJc were joined with a 5\u2032-aaaa-3\u2032 hairpin and then the construct was folded as a single strand. Free energy predictions were not affected by the position of the hairpins, i.e., whether the hairpins were placed between strands 3WJa and 3WJb and strands 3WJb and 3WJc, between strands 3WJb and 3WJc and strands 3WJc and 3WJa, or between strands 3WJc and 3WJa and strands 3WJa and 3WJb. For predictions in RNAsoft, pRNA strands 3WJa and 3WJb were joined with a 5\u2032-aaaa-3\u2032 hairpin and folded with strand 3WJc. Again, free energy predictions were not affected by the position of the hairpin, i.e., whether the hairpin was placed between strands 3WJa and 3WJb, between strands 3WJb and 3WJc, or between strands 3WJc and 3WJa. For each construct, the most stable structure output by each program was the designed structure. No forced base pairs or single strand constraints were used. To correct for the added hairpins, two 5\u2032-aaaa-3\u2032 hairpin penalties were subtracted from the secondary structure stabilities output by RNA Structure, RNAfold, and mfold. For stabilities predicted by RNAsoft, one 5\u2032-aaaa-3\u2032 hairpin penalty was subtracted. Because the calculations take into account the initiation terms for the 3WJs, their free energies are accurate within error whether in the context of a single-stranded RNA, a duplex, or a three-component system. The entropic penalties for bringing together two oligomers are included in the free energy of initiation terms. The free energies of initiating an RNA hairpin and RNA intermolecular interactions are 5.4\u00b10.2 kcal/mol to 6.4\u00b10.2 kcal/mol (spanning loop lengths n=3 to n=9) and 4.09\u00b10.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, while there is a substantial entropic energy difference in bringing together three oligonucleotide strands compared to a single strand self-folding, the calculation of the free energy of the multibranch loop accounts for this difference and makes comparison of the 3WJ motif comparable in different contexts.",

                                "Thermodynamic parameters determined by UV optical melting for each construct and its respective 3WJ nanomotif are reported in Table 2. The GA1, SF5, and M2 pRNA 3WJs showed greater stability than the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ (Table 2).",
                                "Melt curves showed very sharp transitions, supporting the assumption of a cooperative transition from the RNA triplex to single-stranded RNAs (FIG. 4A). None of the single strand or pairwise combination melts showed a significant transition that would compete with the 3WJ (data not shown). For example, a melt of phi29 strands 3WJa and 3WJb showed a transition with a melting temperature of 51\u00b0 C., while the complete 3WJ (i.e., strands 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc together) showed a transition with a melting temperature of 56\u00b0 C. However, formation of the 3WJ is favored when all three strands are present. As previously shown for non-self-complementary RNA duplexes, the non-self-complementary duplex will form even when the Tm for an alternative conformation of a single strand forming a self-complementary duplex has a higher Tm if the enthalpy is more favorable for the non-self-complementary duplex. Free energies for the 3WJ constructs were calculated from van't Hoff plots, where the goodness of linear fit was \u22650.90 for all melts (FIG. 4B). Thermodynamic stabilities of the pRNA 3WJ nanomotifs were calculated by subtracting the stability contributions of the RNA helices as calculated from the Nearest Neighbor Database (Table 2, FIGS. 6A-6B). The free energies for the investigated 3WJs range from \u22129.9 kcal/mol to 10.2 kcal/mol (Table 2). By comparison, 1.4 kcal/mol at 37\u00b0 C. is approximately one order of magnitude in a binding constant. Thus, the range of free energies of formation for the investigated 3WJs spans 14 orders of magnitude in terms of binding constants.",

Specifically, the following two deletion combinations increased stability relative to the WT phi29 pRNA 3WJ: (1) deletion of a single U bulge (U29) in strand 3WJa along with two of the three U residues in the tri-U bulge in strand 3WJb (i.e., U72-73-74); and (2) deletion of all bulge U residues at the 3WJ (i.e., U29/U72-73-74) (Table 2, FIG. 2). Other investigated deletions either did not significantly affect the stability of the phi29 pRNA 3WJ or actively destabilized it (Table 2).",
                                "Of the four RNA secondary structure prediction programs used, none accurately predicted either the actual free energies of the junctions or variations in mutant phi29 pRNA 3WJ stabilities (FIGS. 5A-5B). Best predictions ranged from within 1 kcal/mol of the measured free energy (for phi29\u0394U29/\u0394U72-73-74, by RNAsoft) to 9 kcal/mol (for phi29\u0394U72-73, by RNAfold), while worst predictions ranged from within 1 kcal/mol (for phi29\u0394U29/\u0394U72-73-74, by RNAsoft) to 11 kcal/mol (for phi29\u0394U72-73, by RNAfold).

Additionally, gels depicting the mobility of each pRNA 3WJ construct relative to each single RNA strand and all pairwise combinations in TMS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) were compared to previous work published on the assembly and stabilities of various biological RNAs (data not shown). For each gel, mobility decreased as more components of the RNA system were added, indicating formation of a higher molecular weight complex. Single strands showed the fastest migration and pairwise combinations showed intermediate migration relative to a slow-migrating band that appeared when all three RNA 3WJ strands were present (FIG. 8), indicating that the three RNA components interact more favorably than any two components, and confirming formation of the pRNA 3WJ from strands 3WJa, 3WJb, and 3WJc.",

                                "Among the investigated pRNA 3WJ constructs, the SF5 and M2 pRNA 3WJs were most thermodynamically stable, making them attractive alternatives to the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ scaffold used in pRNA-based nanotechnology. Interestingly, these pRNAs also have shown the highest propensity for self-assembly under the laboratory conditions studied thus far. Analyses of our measured 3WJ stabilities with loop-loop interaction stabilities calculated from sequences provided by Gu and Schroeder (Gu and Schroeder 2011, op.cit.) and Hao and Kieft (Hao and Kieft 2014, op.cit.) provide insights into whether the 3WJ nanomotif plays a compensatory role in stabilizing pRNA. The analyses indicated that while loop-loop interactions are all favorable, 3WJs have a wider range of stabilities (FIG. 9A-B). Specifically, the phi29 and GA1 pRNAs have less favorable 3WJ stabilities, while the M2 and SF5 pRNAs have more favorable 3WJ stabilities (FIG. 9A-B). For phi29 and GA1 pRNAs, the loop-loop interaction stabilities are offset by 3WJ stabilities, while for SF5 and M2 pRNAs, the loop-loop interactions and the 3WJ are both stabilizing. The combination of stabilizing nanomotifs may help explain why only SF5 and M2 pRNAs have shown in vitro self-assembly of higher order multimers. Consistent with their increased thermodynamic stabilities and propensities to assemble into higher-order multimers relative to phi29, the SF5 and M2 sequences may both adopt 3WJ pre-organizations that do not require the disruption of existing coaxial stacking or other favorable interactions in order to self-assemble.",

                                "The new thermodynamic data presented here provide a foundation for inferences about RNA structure-energetics relationships, especially for the four bulge U residues at the 3WJ. Non-Watson-Crick base pairing predominates in RNA 3D structure, forming motifs that facilitate RNA-RNA interactions and bind ligands. The phi29 3WJ crystal structure revealed the formation of a cis base pair between the Watson-Crick edges of U29 and U72 as well as base stacking between U29 and U74. By comparison, the phi29 pRNA 3WJ constructs in which U29 and at least one of the three U residues in the tri-U bulge (i.e., U72-73-74) were retained did not appear to have equivalent thermodynamic stabilities, despite the possibility of base pair formation across these constructs' 3WJs. However, the stability of a 3WJ where U29 and two of the three U residues in the tri-U bulge were retained was nearly equal to that of the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ (4.7 vs. 4.6 kcal/mol, respectively). Interestingly, notable increases in the stability of the phi29 pRNA 3WJ occurred only when one of the U residues in the tri-U bulge was retained (\u22123.3 kcal/mol), or when all bulge U residues at the 3WJ were deleted (0.6 kcal/mol). Neither of these 3WJs would permit the observed base pairing or base stacking between U residues across the junction, suggesting that pairing and stacking are not the only favorable tertiary interactions stabilizing the junction. These mutations may allow for different, favorable helical coaxial stacking interactions, which may contribute to the stability differences observed.",
                                "Free energy outputs by RNA secondary structure prediction programs were not accurately predictive. While all of the programs implemented in this work utilized the same free energy database, the way that multibranch loops are predicted varies in different RNA structure prediction programs. The prediction may consider all possible conformations of coaxial stacking, include only the single most favorable coaxial stacking arrangement, or include knowledge-based parameters from analysis of known secondary structures. None of the algorithms was able to account for the magnitude of differences observed among the measured stabilities of the 3WJs investigated herein. All programs overestimated the stabilities of the phi29 and GA1 pRNA 3WJ constructs and underestimated the stabilities of the SF5 and M2 pRNA 3WJ constructs (FIGS. 5A-6B). Furthermore, none of the programs' predictions discriminated between the stabilities of constructs with deletions in the stem phi29 pRNA 3WJ. For example, neither the mutant that was shown to have the highest stability, nor the mutant that was shown to have the lowest stability, was predicted as such (FIGS. 5A-6B). Instead, deletion mutants were all predicted to have roughly the same free energies (within \u02dc1 kcal/mol).",
