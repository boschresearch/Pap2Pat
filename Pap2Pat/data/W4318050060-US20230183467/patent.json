                                "Conductive polymers and elastomers are known, whether including inherently conductive polymers such as polyanilines, or prepared using conductive metal or carbon powder and/or particulate fillers and/or fiber fillers, which may include metals, polymers, carbon, graphite and similar materials. Such polymers and elastomers are known for use in radio frequency interference (RFI) and/or electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding at high filler loadings for seals, gaskets and other component shielding parts to prevent harm due to interference signals. They are also known in varying amounts for dissipative uses, such as in exterior vehicle parts where it is important to avoid sparking and fire risk by running electronic static charge from certain polymers to ground. Polymer and elastomer compositions with conductive or dissipative properties are used in various applications, however, there is still a need in the art for improvement of such materials in various end applications and for creating new and important end applications such as employing such materials for use in a cleanroom environment. Further, new fields and uses for such compositions are yet to be developed.",
                                "Various parts and components used in manufacturing, particularly those for use in semiconductor manufacturing, including slit valve and gate valve doors, and other seals and gaskets are well known. With respect to slit valve and gate valve doors, such doors close against surfaces within semiconductor manufacturing equipment with a seal or gasket to ensure that contaminants remain outside the reaction chamber and that reactants from within the chamber do not escape the chamber. However, such reaction chambers need to open and close during manufacture to allow wafers for manufacturing chips and similar target substrates to move into and out of a reaction chamber. In one preferred design, the seal for such slit and gate valves is incorporated in a bonded assembly referred to as a bonded gate valve or a bonded slit valve (\u201cBSV\u201d). A goal in such cases is to minimize the level of particulation as it can create contamination in the process. In some cases, as seals degrade, particles can be released and the ultimate sealing properties generally tend to erode over time. Thus, measuring the reliability of seals and minimizing particulation are highly desired properties in most semiconductor manufacturing applications.",
                                "Measuring reliability and degradation rates of seals and gaskets also is a desirable end goal in a wide variety of end applications to maximize effective production life of a seal or gasket, while minimizing the leaks or end effects of compromised seal properties due to degradation.",
                                "BSVs and other seals can be variably impacted by different reactants and different reactant conditions. Such slit valves, incorporating a door and seal, operate on a valve that actuates so as to open and close the door over the \u201cslit\u201d opening into the chamber. The seal is provided so as to seal around the opening or slit in the chamber and seal the chamber opening when the valve is in the closed position. When the valve is open, substrates for semiconductor manufacture are moved in and out of the process chamber through the slit.",
                                "Harsh precursors, plasmas, high-temperature and other conditions can cause different types of seals to wear at variable rates. A majority of such reaction chambers operate under vacuum conditions and use seals throughout the system to maintain the vacuum environment.",
                                "Such seals are generally formed of highly chemically-resistant elastomeric materials, that are costly to purchase, so it is understandable that one may not want to replace a seal before replacement is indicated. However, due to the variability in the impact of reactants and conditions on various elastomeric materials used to make the seals, it is not always easy to predict when a seal is compromised and/or when it will be subject to imminent failure. Elastomeric sealing properties as well as other physical properties of the materials can be tested to estimate failures in different environments and that information used to provide expected seal life information. However, with varying environments, conditions and use expectations, to be safe, one would expect to change out the seal before harm, inconsistency in product outcome or failure to a particular product occurs.",
                                "As the products made in such environments are themselves very costly to manufacture, unnecessary maintenance down time and/or failure are even more costly to a manufacturer than replacement of the seals. Thus, effective seal life is a key factor that impacts chamber up-time, use of the chamber, maintenance scheduling and product failures due to seal material degradation. The chemical, temperature and other process conditions impact the material of the seal and door and mechanical stresses occur due to valve actuation, all of which can lead to seal degradation and failure.",
                                "Such issues also arise in other industries where maintenance costs, seal cost or downtime are costly and/or where the sealing function is key to operation safety, such that seal life monitoring and timely replacement that is cost effective is important. In areas where particulation is problematic, such as in the semiconductor or pharmaceutical industries and other manufacturing clean room environments, minimizing such contamination is also important.",
                                "One way of addressing expected seal life in the prior art is testing, which can incur additional costs and/or labor. Monitors are also sometimes positioned within reaction chambers which are monitored for changing conditions within the chamber that could impact manufacture. Reactants are also monitored. Degradation is typically realized by detecting a vacuum leak or the presence of particle generation from the degrading seal material.",
                                "However, such problems can be ameliorated, cost savings achieved and failures minimized if there were a successful way to know when a seal is compromised and/or impacting the process and requires maintenance. Further, operations could be improved if there were a way to maximize seal life while avoiding the disadvantages of seal degradation as noted above.",
                                "In downhole applications in the oilfield area, seals that provide feedback are described in the prior art, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2017/0130562 A1 which teaches seals in wells and in other components used well head assemblies that embed sensors in a seal to acquire data that can be used to determine and monitor the condition of seals by monitoring physical operating conditions and the stress or strain on the seal. This data is used to determine when the seal will need to be replaced on a scheduled basis regardless of its condition. Data gathered is compared to base-line data using a data analyzer and predictive algorithms to evaluate expected performance characteristics of seals. Antennae and RFID tags or wear sensors may also be incorporated. Sensors may also be embedded in packing.",
                                "Other prior art attempts to monitor aspects of seal life, or to employ sensors and other detectors in semiconductor processing steps include, e.g., placing sensors on slit valves and sealing plates to monitor an aspect of the process, but such attempts more typically focus on monitoring the door function, door pressure or avoidance of damage to process substrates moving in and out of the door so as to ensure their proper transport and positioning within the chamber. Such patents insert or incorporate sensors in or on the seal or separated between chambers and/or inside and outside a chamber or door for monitoring pressure differentials.",

No. 7,841,582 B2 describes a method and apparatus for controlling pressure on a slit valve door using an actuator to apply a different pressure to the actuator and door during cleaning as opposed to during a reaction where the internal pressure will be higher than during cleaning so that the seal is not unnecessarily under high vacuum conditions during cleaning.",

Further, there is further a need for such clean seals if able to provide controlled, but varied levels of electrical properties when needed for particular end applications, such as electronic shielding or dissipative end applications, which levels of conductivity are consistent through the seal and can range from low to high levels of conductivity. Such materials would be particularly useful in semiconductor end applications where low levels of particulation and contamination are desired.",
                                "Gaskets and seals have been available in the art for use in EMI shielding and/or RFI shielding for various end applications. For example, one may insert a shield between a source of electromagnetic radiation and a desired area of protection. Shielding devices may include shielding gaskets or seals and may come in various configurations to close gaps between an EMI shielding device and the area to be protected. EMI shielding devices may include multiple layers and/or coatings may be applied to various materials by sputtering conductive materials on surfaces of those materials using metals such as nickel or tin. Varying matrix materials have been used including for such parts and components, including metals and polymeric or elastomeric materials such as silicones, fluorosilicones, ethylene-propylene copolymers, epoxy polymers and polyurethanes. Typically, the fillers used in such material are conductive in nature, generally include metal or carbon and are in the form of a particle or fiber filler(s). For example Russian Publication No. RU2724650 C1 discloses use of spherical particles of aluminum, graphite or copper in a silicone, fluorosilicone or ethylene-propylene copolymer.",

                                "Available shielding materials typically used for semiconductor or cleanroom use employ a nickel-coated graphite particle in a silicone polymer. Despite the variety of EMI and RFI composites available, not all of them are satisfactory when used in clean seals or cleanroom environments, such as semiconductor manufacturing processes. Such environments may require a higher purity sealing material (e.g., a melt-processible fluoropolymer or perfluoropolymer, a fluoroelastomer or a perfluoroelastomer) or other polymer that does not introduce contaminants into the manufacturing process. To achieve desired electrical properties, in many cases the conductive filler loading must be reasonably high to achieve even a nominal EMI and/or RFI shielding effect, and to achieve a high efficiency level, the filler loading must be very high. For certain \u201cclean\u201d or highly chemically resistant matrices, such high filler loadings are not possible when also trying to maintain adequate sealing and physical properties. Further, in a cleanroom environment, many of the state-of-the-art EMI and/or RFI filler materials such as nickel-coated graphite or metallic fillers can be problematic particulates in the environment as the seals degrade over time. It can also be difficult with respect to some of the known EMI and/or RFI shielding materials known in the art to maintain consistent properties throughout the matrix material of the composition. As a result, conductive properties may also be inconsistent within the matrix leaving too much variation in performance and properties.",

There is further a need in the art for such materials, with levels of conductivity that are generally consistent throughout the seal, gasket or other shielding component, and can range from low to high levels of conductivity.

                        "Applicants have developed compositions and methods using varying amounts of a particular type of a carbon nanostructure additive to provide articles having varying electrical conductivity such that they may be useful, e.g., as additives in EMI shielding and/or RFI shielding applications, or in amounts that allow for an article to function as a quantum tunneling composite (QTC) or a dissipative conductive polymer or elastomer to be employed in various end applications. When acting as a QTC, in one embodiment, e.g., seals or gaskets can be made to respond to levels of compression that may be translated from conductivity changes in the polymer or elastomer under compressive stress in use so as to allow for evaluation of the seal or gasket life in real time.",
                        "Thus, for sealing applications, seals can be made that act as self-sensing seals that can be employed in various end applications where monitoring seal life is key to efficient and cost effective seal performance and maintenance. In semiconductor applications, such seals may be employed in valve assemblies having seals, such as slit valve doors with seals, e.g., BSVs, pendulum valves and other chamber or flow isolation valves, and may also be employed in pharmaceutical clean room applications, downhole and other oil field applications as well as in gas and/or liquid applications in fluid handling chemical applications as seals or other formed articles. As used herein, a \u201cseal\u201d is intended to include a general category of seals and sealing components, including O-rings, gaskets, V-rings, inserts, sealing or shielding layers, and other similar products and is not intended to be limiting unless a specific type of seal is expressly indicated. \u201cArticles\u201d are intended to encompass parts, components, devices, and seals used as products or as part of a product that are formed using the compositions disclosed herein, either alone or in combination with other existing compositions.",
                        "With respect to articles such as seals, providing a seal that can respond sensitively by way of its conductivity level in response to an applied compressive stress (such as when subject to a load), the seal may act as a pressure sensor, and the deterioration of the seal can be evaluated by the relationship between compressive stress and the conductivity at a base line, with and without a load applied, when new, so that the seal can be replaced before seal life and performance are impacted through repeat use and/or harsh conditions. While the self-sensing seals, and methods and systems herein for monitoring seal-life herein are particularly useful for seals, such as vacuum seals or KF type seals and in semiconductor manufacturing valve assemblies including BSVs, and other semiconductor seals, they may also be employed in similar valves that are used in fluid handling and in other environments, especially those in which a seal's life is important to operation and in which the seals are in an environment under pressure, strain and environmental or ambient operating conditions wherein the seal is subject to degradation. This is a particularly difficult issue in the semiconductor manufacturing, and with a particular focus on semiconductor seal assemblies, such as BSVs, pendulum valves and isolation valves. It will be understood, based on this disclosure, that the embodiments described herein can be employed for use in other similar valve sealing assemblies and end applications.",
                        "Examples of gate and slit valves that include seals are known in the art, and articles made from the compositions and methods herein can be implemented using any of these designs. Examples of commercially acceptable doors of this nature are available from Greene,",

Other BSVs and gate valves with bonded or other assemblies with seals that are known or to be developed can be used in the system and method herein.",
                        "Such gate and slit valves are generally formed of a metallic door material (metal or metal alloy), with preferred materials including aluminum or stainless steel. The seals in such doors are preferably formed of elastomeric material or material that has elastomeric properties under the operating conditions. Typical materials used are fluoroelastomer, perfluoroelastomers, and silicon-based elastomers, including fluorosilicones. In addition, back-up rings or seals may also be incorporated such as fluoropolymers (like polytetrafluoroethylene) alone or as a backup protection seal for primary seals formed with elastomeric or materials with elastomeric properties.",
                        "Such seals may be mechanically affixed, bonded, or molded in place on the door, with a variety of materials and door assemblies available commercially.",
                        "The carbon nanostructure additives used herein are preferably those that are formed to have a three-dimensional branched structure and are preferably also formed so as to include within the structures crosslinked carbon nanotubes interlinked with one another to form the three-dimensional branched carbon structure network. Such materials are distinguished from standard single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes and from carbon allotropes such as plate-like carbons and fluorinated graphites. In preferred embodiments herein, such a three-dimensional, branched carbon nanostructure additive is used that has a carbon content of \u2265 about 97% and a bulk density of about 0.135 g/cm3, although these properties may be varied depending on the degree of linking and branching that occurs in the manufacturing process. One suitable carbon nanostructure for use herein is available commercially in pellet form through Cabot Corporation as Athlos\u2122 Carbon Nanostructures. Other suitable materials are also available from Cabot, and/or may be made or manufactured as well as purchased commercially. A description of carbon nanostructure materials that are branched and linked and how to make them may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,107,272, 9,111,658, 9,447,259 and 9,650,501, each of which is incorporated herein in relevant part for its disclosure of methods of making and preparing branched and linked carbon nanostructures.",
                        "Because of the dielectric nature of certain of the curable polymer compositions and their resulting elastomer properties when cured, particularly those of fluoroelastomers and/or perfluoroelastomers, the impact of the branched, three-dimensional carbon nanostructure additives may be felt from a strong conductivity level only when the polymer is highly loaded, however, in other applications, such as for preparing pressure-sensing applications, a smaller loading of such carbon nanostructure additive is indicated.",
                        "In addition to self-sensing end applications and other uses of QTC compositions as noted above and elsewhere herein, when articles are formed using higher loading of the conductive nanostructure additives herein, such articles may be formed into seals or sealing components, including gaskets, covers and a variety of other component parts having a polymeric or elastomer material therein to provide a bulk resistivity of about 0.5 ohm-cm or less, thereby providing useful EMI and/or RFI shielding effects.",
                        "With respect to EMI and/or RFI shielding applications, depending on the curable polymer chosen, the loading may vary. In a variety of polymers, compositions may incorporate from about 0.1 to about 300 parts by weight of the carbon nanostructure per 100 parts by weight of the at least one polymer or curable polymer in the composition, preferably about 0.25 to about 250 parts, more preferably about 0.5 to about 250 parts or about 0.5 to about 80 parts by weight of the carbon nanostructure additive per 100 parts by weight of the at least one polymer or curable polymer in the composition.",
                        "Preferably, in polymers such as curable perfluoropolymers and curable fluoropolymers, about 10 to about 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymer or curable polymer may be employed to provide a preferred level of shielding by absorbing or reflecting EMI and/or RFI. For curable perfluoro- and other curable fluoropolymers which may otherwise be generally more difficult to highly load, about 20 to about 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the curable polymers in the composition may be employed.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the amount of carbon nanostructure additive used may be varied to attempt to get the best shielding effect, and, if possible also maintaining effective elastomeric and/or mechanical properties for the formed article to be used in the shielding end application(s), all of which will depend on the type of shielding part or component being made. With this material, a desired level of maximum bulk resistivity is about 0.5 ohm-cm for effective shielding, although this may be modified for different end applications. In a perfluoropolymers, for example, use of between about 20 to about 40 parts per 100 parts of the perfluoropolymers in the composition will maintain a balance of required mechanical and elastomeric properties while allowing a bulk resistivity of about 0.5 ohm-cm.",
                        "Use of such a carbon nanostructure additive in a curable polymer, once cured may form an elastomeric article according to the invention which may have a variety of shapes and configurations, such as formation into a seal, gasket, a EMI or RFI shielding device or components parts thereof, such as an EMI or RFI filter seal or filter cover. Further, shielding parts formed of other polymeric matrix materials using the carbon nanostructure herein are also within the scope of the disclosure.",
                        "When incorporating the at least one carbon nanostructure additive herein to a curable polymer or other polymeric matrix for use in developing a QTC effect or a dissipative conductive polymer or elastomer, lower loadings of the carbon nanostructure additive(s) are indicated in the inventions herein. For example, about 1 part to about 30 parts by weight of the carbon nanostructure additive per 100 parts by weight of the curable polymer(s) or polymeric matrix polymer(s) may be employed to provide a lower level of conductivity than need in a shielding application. Preferably about 1 part to about 15 parts by weight of the carbon nanostructure additive are used per 100 parts by weight of the curable polymer(s) or polymer(s) in the polymer matrix are used.",
                        "For some lower conductivity uses, such as antistatic dissipative materials that may be used in automotive, aerospace, oilfield, medical and pharmaceutical or other end uses requiring a conductive material that can dissipate a charge to avoid sparking or other issues yet withstand environments in which particular elastomer matrices are indicated, such lower loading up to about 15 parts by weight of the additive per 100 parts by weight of any base polymers(s) are acceptable for this purpose.",
                        "When using the composition for a QTC effect, such as for having a composition that can allow charged particles to jump as in a QTC when the article formed is under compression, low levels of at least about 2 parts, more preferably at least about 3 parts, and most preferably at least about 4 parts to about 30 parts, or to about 15 parts by weight are indicated per 100 parts by weight of the polymer or curable polymer in the composition. In some embodiments, about 4 parts by weight to about 20 parts by weight, and more preferably about 4 to about 15 parts by weight, each per 100 parts by weight of the curable polymer(s) in the composition may be used.",
                        "To create the QTC effect, the carbon nanostructures, which are three-dimensional, branched and crosslinked so that the longer tubes are interlinked, create a more densely accessible QTC electron carrying option throughout the article. As the elastomers used may be selected to act as dielectrics when in use and without compressive stress, such as an applied load, the QTC effect in such elastomers may be carried out by applied compressive stress without the need for intervening dielectric additives and/or without the need for acicular carbons as described in prior art QTC composites. The polymer matrix or elastomer matrix in a cured article provides a dielectric environment that is activated with the application of compressive stress on the compressible dielectric elastomer material to yield a level of proportionate conductivity within the matrix that is measurable depending on the degree of compressive stress applied to allow the relationship between compressive stress and content of the carbon nanostructure additive in the elastomer to be measured and quantified in real time when in use, and analyzed so as to determine seal life.",
                        "For example, a finished molded article such as an elastomeric seal may be placed in use in electrical communication with a circuit having an applied voltage and known resistance to enable measurement of the bulk resistivity or conductivity of the seal both before application of compressive stress, such as through an applied load or in use by compression of moving parts surrounding the seal in its gland, as well as measuring the same properties over time in use for a given amount of carbon nanostructure additive in the elastomer. The resulting relationship can be used to analyze when the additive and elastomer matrix are beginning to deteriorate and the resistivity and conductivity change. Such measurements can then be used to monitor the performance and life of the seal in use to determine when replacement is needed.",
                        "By providing such formed articles from the compositions herein, a seal, gasket or other seal assembly or component part, such as a polymeric or elastomeric component may be made which is \u201cself-sensing\u201d in that its own properties are measured and evaluated to determine seal life and performance in real-time during usage without the need for external sensors, embedding of sensors that impact properties, such as sealing properties, or use of complex sensor placement and relationships around or near a seal on doors such as BSV doors or gates or within reaction chambers or surrounding environments. Further, the carbon nanostructures herein contribute to more consistent conductivity properties throughout the polymer or elastomer matrix of the articles formed.",
                        "Further use of compositions herein to form articles that have QTC effects formed from polymers or elastomers can be employed using varying polymers and elastomers for forming self-sensing articles, such as seals, and for use in other known QTC material applications formed from prior art QTC composites such as for use in medical devices, such as blood pressure machine cuffs, in clothing for pressure sensitive controls for audio or phone devices for playing digital sound or video files, for transducers in downhole tools in oil field applications as in U.S. Pat. No. 8,893,547, for sport training dummies having sensors used in boxing or fencing, for evaluating athletic training footwear, for touch sensors and prostheses based on robotic technology as well as in smart seals, and for use in various medical and pharmaceutical applications.",
                        "In addition to the carbon nanostructure additives herein, with respect to curable polymer compositions, such compositions include at least one curable polymer that is incorporated in the composition prior to cure. Further such compositions may also include in some preferred embodiments herein crosslinking agents or curative materials, that enable crosslinking of the curable polymers to form elastomers. Crosslinking may also be thermally induced or carried out by radiation using techniques that are known or to be developed in the relevant art, including curing various commercial products using the cure systems that function with their functional crosslinking group, including those that may be indicated by a manufacturer of a commercial curable polymer(s) as described further below.",
                        "For polymer-based compositions herein or for elastomer compositions herein formed using curable polymer compositions once cured, such polymer and elastomer compositions can provide polymeric or elastomeric articles, including seals, e.g., O-rings, gaskets, component parts, coatings, layers, and the like that may be used in a variety of end applications including those noted above.",
                        "Other additives used may vary depending on whether a non-curable or a curable polymer system selected. For example, varying curable polymers when cured as elastomers have varying mechanical and elastomeric properties and can tolerate or are best used with different additives, processing aids, fillers, pigments and the like. Such additions for polymeric and elastomeric compositions are generally known.",
                        "As the carbon nanostructures herein are may be used to impart unique conductivity and resistivity properties to a polymeric or a curable polymeric and/or cured elastomer matrix, whether as a shielding additive, a dissipative additive or a QTC additive, the additives used are preferably those that can either complement or enhance those effects or that do not substantially affect the desired conductive and resistive properties and that also do not overly impact in a negative manner the mechanical or elastomeric properties of the resulting article for its intended end use.",
                        "Compositions herein may incorporate elastomeric or non-elastomeric matrix materials. Preferably, in EMI and/or RFI shielding components, the matrix is an elastomer, and in further preferred embodiments, the matrix is a fluoroelastomer, including elastomeric perfluoropolyethers, fluorosilicones, perfluoroelastomers, and blends of these materials and of more than one type of these materials. QTC components may be either elastomeric or non-elastomeric, but in the case of formation of specialty self-sensing seals formed of a QTC composition, it is preferred that the matrix is also elastomeric.",
                        "With respect to suitable curable polymers, such materials including those that may crosslink or cure by functional groups to form an elastomeric matrix material. For example, useful elastomers include silicones, fluorosilicones, nitrile rubber, olefinic rubbers (such as ethylene-propylene-diene rubber or ethylene-propylene rubber), fluoroelastomers including perfluoropolyether-based elastomers, perfluoroelastomers, polyurethanes, and copolymers and blends thereof.",
                        "Such elastomers are formed from curable polymers, copolymers and blends thereof, including those formed from monomers comprising silicon and/or fluorine, curable polymers having at least one acrylonitrile monomer and at least one butadiene monomer, curable polymers with at least one olefinic monomer, and curable polymers having at least one fluorinated monomer and/or perfluorinated monomer. Such materials may be copolymerized, blended and/or functionalized to form curable polymers. Preferably, at least one of the monomers used to form the at least one curable polymer has one or more functional groups for crosslinking. Crosslinking may be carried out chemically, through use of radiation or heat and/or through addition of one or more crosslinking compounds that upon chemical reaction with a crosslinking site on a functional group on a monomer, can crosslink various monomers to form crosslinked polymers.",
                        "\u201cCuring\u201d as used herein is meant to encompass any method of providing an elastomeric structure to a curable polymer by either vulcanization, chemical crosslinking, thermal cross-linking, catalyzed cross-linking, radiation cross-linking and the like. After curing, a curable polymer forms an elastomer. An \u201celastomer\u201d (also sometimes referred to as a rubber) as used herein is intended to mean a polymeric material that has viscoelastic properties, and that upon application of a stress will deform, but after removal of the stress, will recover a portion of its original form.",
                        "As used herein, \u201ccompression set\u201d refers to the propensity of an elastomeric material to remain distorted and not return to its original shape after a deforming compressive load has been removed. The compression set value is expressed as a percentage of the original deflection that the material fails to recover. For example, a compression set value of 0% indicates that a material completely returns to its original shape after removal of a deforming compressive load. Conversely, a compression set value of 100% indicates that a material does not recover at all from an applied deforming compressive load. A compression set value of 30% signifies that 70% of the original deflection has been recovered. Higher compression set values generally indicate a potential for seal leakage.",
                        "Other elastomeric properties typically measured include elongation at break, tensile modulus, and other physical properties. Thermal behavior of elastomers and their cure system's impact on such properties are also useful for evaluation of an elastomer for various end use applications.",
                        "The terms \u201cuncured\u201d or \u201ccurable,\u201d refer to curable polymers for use in compositions herein, which have not yet been subjected to crosslinking reactions in any substantial degree such that the material is not yet sufficiently cured for the intended end application.",
                        "The following provides further information on useful categories of polymers that may be used herein, including those noted above as useful as matrix materials for QTC components or for EMI and/or RFI shielding components.",
                        "Silicones for use herein may be formed using a silicon-containing polymer that may be any of a variety of silicone homopolymers and co-polymers that are curable to form a silicone elastomer (also referred to as a silicone rubber). Silicones are generally polymers that incorporate at least silicon, oxygen and hydrogen in their chemical structure. Curable silicon-containing polymers (silicones) which may be used to form silicone elastomers include polymers having a backbone as classified by the Standard Rubber Nomenclature definitions provided by ASTM International in ASTM D1418-17 as VMQ (silicones), PVMQ (phenylsilicones) and FVMQ (fluorosilicones). However, silicones that are not readily classified by ASTM D1418-17 may also be used provided they demonstrate useful manufacturing characteristics. Any such silicones, fluorosilicones or phenylsilicones may be employed in the invention.",
                        "Silicones for forming silicone rubber can be cured using a variety of curing systems, including catalyst cure systems, typically using a platinum-based catalyst, a condensation curing system, a peroxide cure system and an oxime cure system.",
                        "In platinum catalyst curing, crosslinks are formed using functional silicone polymers such as vinyl-functional silicones and hydride-functional silicones through addition reactions to form the crosslinks. Such reaction leaves no byproducts and so is a preferred pathway for curing in the art.",
                        "Condensation systems typically involve a crosslinking material that is activated in some manner. In a common one-part system, functional silicones are employed that when contacted with water at room temperature will undergo hydrolysis and the hydrolyzable groups (hydroxyl or silanol groups) will initiate the curing reaction. The hydrolysis reaction once initiated continues until curing is done, and can take place at room temperature. Crosslinking materials include for condensation systems including functional silanes having active oxygen containing groups such as alkoxy, acetoxy, ester, enoxy or oxime silanes, e.g., methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriacetoxysilane and similar materials. Such substituted groups and/or functionalized groups can be catalyzed as well if desired using organometallic catalysts such as tetraalkoxytitanates, chelated titanates, tin catalysts (e.g., dibutyl tin dilaurate and acetoxy tin).",
                        "In a two-part condensation, the crosslinking material and any catalyst is retained in one container while the curable silicone polymer composition (absent those materials) is retained in a separate container. The curing is initiated upon mixing of the materials in the two containers.",

Suitable commercial silicones for use herein including NuSil\u00ae from Nusil Silicone Technology Co., which may be used in QTC or EMI and/or RF shielding applications, and PDMS-Sylgard\u00ae from Dow-Corning which may be used in QTC end applications.",

Further, such silicon-containing polymers may have one or more hydrogen or one or silicon-bonded bonded group(s) on the silicon atoms in the main chain substituted with one or more groups, each of which substituted groups may further be functionalized or further substituted or used for crosslinking. Such substituted or functional groups may be branched and/or straight chain groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, alkoxy, alkenoxy, alkynoxy, aryloxy, arylalkyl, arylalkoxy, arylalkenoxy, vinyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, halogen, heterocyclic, and fluorinated or perfluorinated groups.",
