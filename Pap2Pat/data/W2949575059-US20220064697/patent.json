    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for imaging or determining nucleic acids in cells or other samples. In some cases, the transcriptome of a cell may be determined. Certain embodiments are generally directed to determining nucleic acids and other targets in a sample at relatively high resolutions. For instance, nucleic acid probes may be applied to sample, and binding of the nucleic acid probes to a target may be amplified using primary and secondary amplifier nucleic acids. In some cases, there is a maximum number of amplifier nucleic acids that can be bound to a target, e.g., the binding is saturatable, and cannot grow indefinitely, even in the presence of abundant reagents. This may be advantageous, for example, for controlling the brightness of each binding event, controlling the size of the amplified regions (e.g., during imaging), and/or for limiting the degree of amplification noise (i.e. the final variation in amplified signal from molecule to molecule), etc. In addition, in some embodiments, the primary and/or secondary amplifier nucleic acids may be formed from only 3 of the 4 naturally-occurring nucleotides, which may result in less secondary structure, faster binding rates, etc. These properties can in some cases facilitate the rapid design of multiple orthogonal amplification sequences, allowing the extension of such an approach to many distinct molecular targets.",

                        "Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) provides both RNA abundance and spatial positions by the direct detection of individual RNA molecules in single cells. By using this technique, RNA localization has been shown to associate with multiple cell functions, like body patterning in development, cell fate determination during cell division, local translation, cell migration, and establishment of polarity. To study RNA localization at transcriptomic scale within intact cells and tissues, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) and in situ sequencing have been developed. Among these, MERFISH uses error-robust binary barcoding and sequential imaging to multiplex smFISH measurements with high detection efficiency. However, higher photon counts of the signal would improve throughput limited by imaging acquiring speed, light scattering caused by deep tissue imaging, and low signal to background due to sample autofluorescence. Thus, improvements in increasing photon counts are needed to allow substantial increases in imaging throughput, the targeting of short RNAs that may not allow the binding of sufficient probes to produce signals above the background signal levels, and/or to extend multiplexed measurements to sample types with high levels of background signal.",
                        "However, the performance of multiplexed single-molecule RNA imaging methods depends on many properties that signal amplification can degrade or challenge. For example, it is often important for the variation in the signal brightness from molecule to molecule to be relatively small. Similarly, it is often important for the physical size or extent of the signal from individual molecules to be as small as possible to prevent substantial overlap of the signal from physically adjacent molecules. In parallel, amplification methods may not be high efficiency, and some molecules may not be amplified while others are, leading to a reduction in the fraction of detected molecules. In addition, it is often important to be able to amplify multiple, orthogonal, molecular signals and, critically, to be able to rapidly extend amplification methods to more distinct molecular signals. Finally, such amplification methods should be rapid to reduce sample preparation time. For these reasons, amplification methods that do not introduce signal brightness variation, increase the physical extent of the signal from individual molecules, which are highly efficient in the amplification of the signal from all target molecules, and which can be rapidly extended to multiple distinct targets are needed."

                        "The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for imaging or determining nucleic acids in cells or other samples. In some cases, the transcriptome of a cell may be determined. Certain embodiments are generally directed to determining nucleic acids and other targets in a sample at relatively high resolutions. For instance, nucleic acid probes may be applied to sample, and binding of the nucleic acid probes to a target may be amplified using primary and secondary amplifier nucleic acids. In some cases, there is a maximum number of amplifier nucleic acids that can be bound to a target, e.g., the binding is saturatable, and cannot grow indefinitely, even in the presence of abundant reagents. This may be advantageous, for example, for controlling the brightness of each binding event, controlling the size of the amplified regions (e.g., during imaging), and/or for limiting the degree of amplification noise (i.e. the final variation in amplified signal from molecule to molecule), etc. In addition, in some embodiments, the primary and/or secondary amplifier nucleic acids may be formed from only 3 of the 4 naturally-occurring nucleotides, which may result in less secondary structure, faster binding rates, etc. These properties can in some cases facilitate the rapid design of multiple orthogonal amplification sequences, allowing the extension of such an approach to many distinct molecular targets.",
                        "In one aspect, the present invention is generally directed to systems and methods for amplifying the signal of targets (potentially tens, hundreds, thousands, or more) within a biological sample, e.g., for imaging using MERFISH or other techniques. For example, in some embodiments, these techniques provide a fast, simple, and/or efficient way to amplify the signal of hundreds or thousands of RNA targets simultaneously, e.g., in the native environment of biological samples. Such amplification can be well-controlled by using a saturatable system, in certain embodiments, as discussed herein. Because of this, the variation in brightness from spot to spot can be minimized during the amplification, which can be useful in decoding using MERFISH or other techniques. In some embodiments, the sizes of the amplified spots also do not increase. This may improve the ability to identify targets, e.g., located relatively to close to each other. For example, the signal from one target may overlap with that from another target if the spot sizes increase too much. In addition, as discussed below, the amplifier nucleic acids in some embodiments do not contain hairpin structures, e.g., that may be involved in the amplification process, which may facilitate the creation of a saturatable system, and/or apply the design of multiple amplifier systems to a large number of targets. In addition, also as discussed below, the amplifier nucleic acids may be constructed using only three nucleotides. Three-letter nucleotides may have significantly less secondary structure than four-letter nucleotides, and faster binding rates. In addition, in some cases, the possibility that any given amplifier sequence will work reliably is increased, e.g., by reducing the possibility of unintentional secondary structure.",
                        "A non-limiting example of such a system is now illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1E. In FIG. 1A, a target 10 (RNA, in this example) is illustrated. There may be hundreds or thousands of targets distributed within a biological sample (e.g., a cell or a tissue), and the binding of nucleic acid probes to the targets may be used to determine their distribution, e.g., by using fluorescent probes and imaging the sample. Note, however, that only a single target is illustrated here for clarity.",
                        "In some embodiments, a plurality of nucleic acid probes are used that have different sequences, and the distribution of each of the nucleic acid probes is sequentially analyzed and used to create \u201ccodewords\u201d for each location, based on the binding patterns of each of the nucleic acid probes. By selecting nucleic acid probes that defines a suitable code space, apparent errors in the observed binding patterns can be identified, and/or discarded and/or corrected to identify the correct codeword, and thus the correct target of the nucleic acid probes within the sample. This error-robustness and error-correction system was first introduced for multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), and has also been subsequently used in various related techniques. See, e.g., Int. Pat. Apl. Pub. Nos. WO 2016/018960 and WO 2016/018963, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.",
                        "An example of an encoding nucleic acid probe is shown in FIG. 1A, where an encoding nucleic acid probe 15 (shown in a dotted box) has bound to a target 10, e.g., a target RNA. Other nucleic acid probes 16, 17 may also bind to the target RNA, and/or to other targets within the sample. Probe 15 may comprise a target sequence 11 that is able to bind to the target RNA (e.g., via specific binding), and a read sequence 12 (or \u201creadout\u201d sequence), i.e., a sequence that can be \u201cread\u201d to determine whether or not binding has occurred. One, two, three, or more read sequences may be present on a probe. For instance, in this example, two such read sequences are present in probe 15 (identified as read sequence 12 and read sequence 19). The read sequences may each independently be the same or different. In addition, probes such as 16 and 17 may have the same or different numbers of read sequences, and/or the same or different structures, as nucleic acid probe 15.",
                        "If no amplification is applied, then nucleic acid probe 15 may be exposed to a suitable secondary nucleic acid probe 32 containing a signaling entity 40, as is shown in FIG. 1E. In this example, the signaling entity is linked to the secondary nucleic acid probe via a disulfide linkage, although other techniques may be used in other embodiments. However, in this case, only one signaling entity can be linked to the target. It thus can be relatively difficult to detect the single signaling entity, and use it to determine binding of nucleic acid probe 15 to target 10, due to the low signal intensity produced after such a binding event.",
                        "Accordingly, in FIG. 1B, a primary amplifier nucleic acid 20 can be used, in accordance with certain embodiments. The primary amplifier nucleic acid may contain a first primary recognition sequence 22 able to bind (e.g., specifically) to a read sequence of nucleic acid probe 15, and one or more primary read sequences 23 able to bind (e.g., specifically) to one or more secondary amplifier nucleic acids, as discussed below. In this example, \u201cN\u201d such read sequences are shown schematically in the primary amplifier nucleic acid (N may be, for instance, 5, 7, 9, or other numbers as discussed herein). The primary read sequences may each have the same or different sequences, and may have the same or different lengths. In this example, each read sequence is 20 nucleotides long, although this is by way of example only. In addition, as previously noted, although two such primary amplifier nucleic acids are shown here, this is by way of example only, and other numbers of primary amplifier nucleic acids may be bound to the nucleic acid probe in other embodiments.",
                        "Next, as shown in FIG. 1C, secondary amplifier nucleic acids 30 may be bound to the primary amplifier nucleic acid. A secondary amplifier nucleic acid may contain a first recognition sequence 33 able to bind (e.g., specifically) to read sequence 23 of primary amplifier nucleic acid 20, and one or more secondary read sequences 34 able to bind to a signaling entity, as discussed below.",
                        "As with the primary amplifier nucleic acids, any number of secondary read sequences may be present in the secondary amplifier nucleic acids, as is shown in this figure. The secondary read sequences may each have the same or different sequences, and may have the same or different lengths relative to each other. The secondary read sequences also may be the same or different than the read sequences of the primary amplifier nucleic acids. In this example, each secondary amplifier nucleic acid may have \u201cM\u201d read sequences. M may be, e.g., 5, 7, 9, or other numbers as discussed herein, and M may be the same or different than N.",
                        "In FIG. 1D, a plurality of signaling entities 40 has been bound to the read sequences of the secondary amplifier nucleic acids. In this example, the signaling entities are each bound via a disulfide linkage, although other techniques may be used in other embodiments, as discussed herein.",
                        "Additionally, in this case, there is expected to be a maximum, or a saturation limit, of signaling entities that have bound to each read sequence of the target sequence. In this particular example, there are N\u00d7M such positions available for each of the read sequences of the nucleic acid probe (2 such read sequences here), assuming both have substantially the same structure (although they do not necessarily have to have the same structure, i.e., the same number of N\u00d7M positions available, e.g., if they have amplifier nucleic acids with different structures). Thus, the number of signaling entities that can be associated with a given target is a finite, predictable number, and cannot grow indefinitely or without bound.",
                        "In this example, two read sequences 12 and 19 were discussed, each of which may have primary and secondary amplifier nucleic acids and associated signaling entities. These may or may not have the same or different structures, e.g., signaling entities and/or amplifier nucleic acids associated with read sequence 12 may not associate with read sequence 19, and vice versa. (However, as mentioned above, 2 read sequences are provided here by way of example only, and in other embodiments, there may be 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. distinct read sequences, which can be amplified in parallel, e.g., using similar approaches, including with distinct amplifier nucleic acids, etc.) The read sequences may be independently determined, e.g., sequentially or simultaneously, by determining signaling entities associated with each of the read sequences, which may be the same or different. For instance, as shown in FIG. 1D, signaling entities 40 are able to associate with primary amplifier nucleic acid 20 and secondary amplifier nucleic acid 30, ultimately to read sequence 12, but are not able to associate with read sequence 19 or its associated primary and secondary amplifier nucleic acids 29 and 39, respectively.",
                        "In addition, in some embodiments, amplification can involve the binding of only one round of amplifier nucleic acids (producing a N-fold amplification), two rounds (producing N\u00d7M-fold amplification), three rounds (producing a N\u00d7M\u00d7O amplification where the third round of molecules contain 0 read sequences), or more in some cases. In some cases, any number of rounds of amplification can be applied.",
                        "Additionally, the sample may contain nucleic acid probes that have many different readout sequences, e.g., that can be recognized using different amplifier nucleic acids or signaling entities. For example, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, or other numbers of readout sequences could be used, including more than 64 rounds. In some cases, unique amplifier nucleic acids can be used for the amplification of the readout sequences, e.g., such as that the original readout sequence present can be amplified into, e.g., N\u00d7M copies, using suitable amplifier nucleic acids. In certain cases, the amplifier nucleic acids may be efficiently designed. For example, by utilizing only three of the four nucleotides in the sequences of the amplifier nucleic acids, the probability of unanticipated secondary structure within the amplifier nucleic acids can be reduced. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that because the effect of such secondary structure of binding of the amplifier nucleic acids themselves, or subsequent amplifier nucleic acids can be difficult to predict, reducing or eliminating secondary structure can increase the probability that a given amplifier nucleic acid will properly assemble, which can facilitate the design and use of large numbers of orthogonal amplifier nucleic acids. In addition, by reducing secondary structure, which can also inhibit the rate of binding of these amplifier nucleic acids, such design considerations can decrease the time required to assemble such structures, or decrease the amount of amplifier nucleic acids required for each sample, etc.",
                        "The controlled amplification provided by this approach is in contrast to techniques such as hairpin unfolding or rolling circle amplification, where amplification of a signal can effectively grow in an uncontrolled manner or indefinitely, i.e., when sufficient reagents are present. Such uncontrolled amplification can be difficult to accurately determine, as the amount of signal present may not be well-correlated to the number of targets, or the location of the target (for example, with larger amounts of signal created by uncontrolled amplification, the \u201cspot size\u201d appearing in a microscopic image may grow larger, and not necessarily centered around the target, thus impeding the resolution of the image, or interfering with signals from other, nearby targets). In contrast, the use of saturatable amplification techniques, as discussed herein, may create a maximum number of signaling entities that can associate with a target, which may limit spot sizes, create uniformity in the brightness or intensities of the spots, improve detection, or the like.",
                        "As mentioned, in certain embodiments, such techniques may be combined with error correction, e.g., as is used in MERFISH or other similar techniques. For example, codewords may be based on the binding (or non-binding) of the plurality of nucleic acid probes, and in some cases, the codewords may define an error-correcting code to help reduce or prevent misidentification of the nucleic acid probes. In some cases, a relatively large number of different targets may be identified using a relatively small number of labels, e.g., by using various combinatorial approaches. Image acquisition techniques such as STORM can also be used to image such samples and facilitate determination of the nucleic acid probes. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 9,712,805 or 10,073,035, or Int. Pat. Apl. Pub. Nos. WO 2008/091296 or WO 2009/085218, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for additional details regarding techniques such as MERFISH.",
                        "The above discussion is a non-limiting example of one embodiment of the present invention that can be used to improve determination of targets in a sample using MERFISH or other techniques. However, other embodiments are also possible, in addition to the ones described above. Accordingly, more generally, various aspects of the invention are directed to various systems and methods for imaging or determining nucleic acids in cells or other samples.",
                        "Certain aspects thus are directed to determining a sample, which may include a cell culture, a suspension of cells, a biological tissue, a biopsy, an organism, or the like. The sample can also be cell-free but nevertheless contain nucleic acids in some cases. If the sample contains a cell, the cell may be a human cell, or any other suitable cell, e.g., a mammalian cell, a fish cell, an insect cell, a plant cell, or the like. More than one cell may be present in some cases.",
                        "Within the sample, the targets to be determined can include nucleic acids, proteins, or the like. Nucleic acids to be determined may include, for example, DNA (for example, genomic DNA), RNA, or other nucleic acids that are present within a cell (or other sample). The nucleic acids may be endogenous to the cell, or added to the cell. For instance, the nucleic acid may be viral, or artificially created. In some cases, the nucleic acid to be determined may be expressed by the cell. The nucleic acid is RNA in some embodiments. The RNA may be coding and/or non-coding RNA. For example, the RNA may encode a protein. Non-limiting examples of RNA that may be studied within the cell include mRNA, siRNA, rRNA, miRNA, tRNA, lncRNA, snoRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, piRNAs, or the like.",
                        "In some cases, a significant portion of the nucleic acid within the cell may be studied. For instance, in some cases, enough of the RNA present within a cell may be determined so as to produce a partial or complete transcriptome of the cell. In some cases, at least 4 types of mRNAs are determined within a cell, and in some cases, at least 3, at least 4, at least 7, at least 8, at least 12, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 22, at least 30, at least 31, at least 32, at least 50, at least 63, at least 64, at least 72, at least 75, at least 100, at least 127, at least 128, at least 140, at least 255, at least 256, at least 500, at least 1,000, at least 1,500, at least 2,000, at least 2,500, at least 3,000, at least 4,000, at least 5,000, at least 7,500, at least 10,000, at least 12,000, at least 15,000, at least 20,000, at least 25,000, at least 30,000, at least 40,000, at least 50,000, at least 75,000, or at least 100,000 types of mRNAs may be determined within a cell.",
                        "In some cases, the transcriptome of a cell may be determined. It should be understood that the transcriptome generally encompasses all RNA molecules produced within a cell, not just mRNA. Thus, for instance, the transcriptome may also include rRNA, tRNA, siRNA, etc. in certain instances. In some embodiments, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or 100% of the transcriptome of a cell may be determined.",
                        "In some embodiments, other targets to be determined can include targets that are linked to nucleic acids, proteins, or the like. For instance, in one set of embodiments, a binding entity able to recognize a target may be conjugated to a nucleic acid probe. The binding entity may be any entity that can recognize a target, e.g., specifically or non-specifically. Non-limiting examples include enzymes, antibodies, receptors, complementary nucleic acid strands, aptamers, or the like. For example, an oligonucleotide-linked antibody may be used to determine a target. The target may bind to the oligonucleotide-linked antibody, and the oligonucleotides determined as discussed herein.",
                        "The determination of targets, such as nucleic acids within the cell or other sample, may be qualitative and/or quantitative. In addition, the determination may also be spatial, e.g., the position of the nucleic acids, or other targets, within the cell or other sample may be determined in two or three dimensions. In some embodiments, the positions, number, and/or concentrations of nucleic acids, or other targets, within the cell or other sample may be determined.",
                        "In some cases, a significant portion of the genome of a cell may be determined. The determined genomic segments may be continuous or interspersed on the genome. For example, in some cases, at least 4 genomic segments are determined within a cell, and in some cases, at least 3, at least 4, at least 7, at least 8, at least 12, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 22, at least 30, at least 31, at least 32, at least 50, at least 63, at least 64, at least 72, at least 75, at least 100, at least 127, at least 128, at least 140, at least 255, at least 256, at least 500, at least 1,000, at least 1,500, at least 2,000, at least 2,500, at least 3,000, at least 4,000, at least 5,000, at least 7,500, at least 10,000, at least 12,000, at least 15,000, at least 20,000, at least 25,000, at least 30,000, at least 40,000, at least 50,000, at least 75,000, or at least 100,000 genomic segments may be determined within a cell.",
                        "In some cases, the entire genome of a cell may be determined. It should be understood that the genome generally encompasses all DNA molecules produced within a cell, not just chromosome DNA. Thus, for instance, the genome may also include, in some cases, mitochondria DNA, chloroplast DNA, plasmid DNA, etc., e.g., in addition to (or instead of) chromosome DNA. In some embodiments, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or 100% of the genome of a cell may be determined.",
                        "As discussed herein, a variety of nucleic acid probes may be used to determine one or more targets within a cell or other sample. The probes may comprise nucleic acids (or entities that can hybridize to a nucleic acid, e.g., specifically) such as DNA, RNA, LNA (locked nucleic acids), PNA (peptide nucleic acids), and/or combinations thereof. In some cases, additional components may also be present within the nucleic acid probes, e.g., as discussed below. In addition, any suitable method may be used to introduce nucleic acid probes into a cell.",
                        "For example, in some embodiments, the cell is fixed prior to introducing the nucleic acid probes, e.g., to preserve the positions of the nucleic acids or other targets within the cell. Techniques for fixing cells are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As non-limiting examples, a cell may be fixed using chemicals such as formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ethanol, methanol, acetone, acetic acid, or the like. In one embodiment, a cell may be fixed using HEPES-glutamic acid buffer-mediated organic solvent (HOPE).",
                        "The nucleic acid probes may be introduced into the cell (or other sample) using any suitable method. In some cases, the cell may be sufficiently permeabilized such that the nucleic acid probes may be introduced into the cell by flowing a fluid containing the nucleic acid probes around the cells. In some cases, the cells may be sufficiently permeabilized as part of a fixation process; in other embodiments, cells may be permeabilized by exposure to certain chemicals such as ethanol, methanol, Triton, or the like. In addition, in some embodiments, techniques such as electroporation or microinjection may be used to introduce nucleic acid probes into a cell or other sample.",
                        "Certain aspects are thus generally directed to nucleic acid probes that are introduced into a cell (or other sample). The probes may comprise any of a variety of entities that can hybridize to a nucleic acid, typically by Watson-Crick base pairing, such as DNA, RNA, LNA, PNA, etc., depending on the application. The nucleic acid probe typically contains a target sequence that is able to bind to at least a portion of a target, e.g., a target nucleic acid. In some cases, the binding may be specific binding (e.g., via complementary binding). When introduced into a cell or other system, the target sequence may be able to bind to a specific target (e.g., an mRNA, or other nucleic acids as discussed herein). The nucleic acid probe may also contain one or more read sequences, as discussed below.",
                        "In some cases, more than one type of nucleic acid probe may be applied to a sample, e.g., sequentially or simultaneously. For example, there may be at least 2, at least 5, at least 10, at least 25, at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, at least 300, at least 1,000, at least 3,000, at least 10,000, or at least 30,000 distinguishable nucleic acid probes that are applied to a sample. In some cases, the nucleic acid probes may be added sequentially. However, in some cases, more than one nucleic acid probe may be added simultaneously.",
                        "The nucleic acid probe may include one or more target sequences, which may be positioned anywhere within the nucleic acid probe. The target sequence may contain a region that is substantially complementary to a portion of a target, e.g., a target nucleic acid. For instance, in some cases, the portions may be at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 92%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100% complementary, e.g., to produce specific binding. Typically, complementarity is determined on the basis of Watson-Crick nucleotide base pairing.",

Combinations of any of these are also possible, e.g., the target sequence may have a length of between 10 and 30 nucleotides, between 20 and 40 nucleotides, between 5 and 50 nucleotides, between 10 and 200 nucleotides, or between 25 and 35 nucleotides, between 10 and 300 nucleotides, etc.",
                        "The target sequence of a nucleic acid probe may be determined with reference to a target suspected of being present within a cell or other sample. For example, a target nucleic acid to a protein may be determined using the protein's sequence, e.g., by determining the nucleic acids that are expressed to form the protein. In some cases, only a portion of the nucleic acids encoding the protein are used, e.g., having the lengths as discussed above. In addition, in some cases, more than one target sequence that can be used to identify a particular target may be used. For instance, multiple probes can be used, sequentially and/or simultaneously, that can bind to or hybridize to the same or different regions of the same target.

For instance, the amount of saturation (or the number of signaling entities bound, relative to the maximum number that can bind) may be less than 97%, less than 95%, less than 90%, less than 85%, less than 80%, less than 75%, etc., and/or at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, etc. In some cases, allowing more time for binding to occur and/or increasing the concentration of reagents may increase the amount of saturation.",
                        "Because of the potential upper limit on the number of signaling entities actually bound to a nucleic acid probe or its target, the binding events distributed within a sample, e.g., spatially, may present substantially uniform sizes and/or brightnesses, in contrast to uncontrolled amplifications, such as those discussed above. For instance, due to the specific number of secondary amplifier nucleic acids that can bind to a primary amplifier nucleic acids, the secondary amplifier nucleic acids cannot be found greater than a fixed distance from the nucleic acid probe or its target, which may limit the \u201cspot size\u201d or diameter of fluorescence from the signaling entities, indicating binding.",

                        "In addition, as previously discussed, certain aspects of the invention use code spaces that encode the various binding events, and optionally can use error detection and/or correction to determine the binding of nucleic acid probes to their targets. In some cases, a population of nucleic acid probes may contain certain \u201cread sequences\u201d which can bind certain amplifier nucleic acids, as discussed above, and the locations of the nucleic acid probes or targets can be determined within the sample using signaling entities associated with the amplifier nucleic acids, for example, within a certain code space, e.g., as discussed herein. See also Int. Pat. Apl. Pub. Nos. WO 2016/018960 and WO 2016/018963, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As mentioned, in some cases, a population of read sequences within the nucleic acid probes may be combined in various combinations, e.g., such that a relatively small number of read sequences may be used to determine a relatively large number of different nucleic acid probes, as discussed herein.",
                        "Thus, in some cases, a population of nucleic acid probes may each contain a certain number of read sequences, some of which are shared between different nucleic acid probes such that the total population of nucleic acid probes may contain a certain number of read sequences. A population of nucleic acid probes may have any suitable number of read sequences. For example, a population of nucleic acid probes may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. read sequences. More than 20 are also possible in some embodiments. In addition, in some cases, a population of nucleic acid probes may, in total, have 1 or more, 2 or more, 3 or more, 4 or more, 5 or more, 6 or more, 7 or more, 8 or more, 9 or more, 10 or more, 11 or more, 12 or more, 13 or more, 14 or more, 15 or more, 16 or more, 20 or more, 24 or more, 32 or more, 40 or more, 50 or more, 60 or more, 64 or more, 100 or more, 128 or more, etc. of possible read sequences present, although some or all of the probes may each contain more than one read sequence, as discussed herein. In addition, in some embodiments, the population of nucleic acid probes may have no more than 100, no more than 80, no more than 64, no more than 60, no more than 50, no more than 40, no more than 32, no more than 24, no more than 20, no more than 16, no more than 15, no more than 14, no more than 13, no more than 12, no more than 11, no more than 10, no more than 9, no more than 8, no more than 7, no more than 6, no more than 5, no more than 4, no more than 3, or no more than two read sequences present. Combinations of any of these are also possible, e.g., a population of nucleic acid probes may comprise between 10 and 15 read sequences in total.",
                        "As a non-limiting example of an approach to combinatorially identifying a relatively large number of nucleic acid probes from a relatively small number of read sequences contained within the nucleic acid probes, in a population of 6 different types of nucleic acid probes, each comprising one or more read sequences, the total number of read sequences within the population may be no greater than 4. It should be understood that although 4 read sequences are used in this example for ease of explanation, in other embodiments, larger numbers of nucleic acid probes may be realized, for example, using 5, 8, 10, 16, 32, etc. or more read sequences, or any other suitable number of read sequences described herein, depending on the application. For example, if each of the nucleic acid probes contains two different read sequences, then by using 4 such read sequences (A, B, C, and D), up to 6 probes may be separately identified. It should be noted that in this example, the ordering of read sequences on a nucleic acid probe is not essential, i.e., \u201cAB\u201d and \u201cBA\u201d may be treated as being synonymous (although in other embodiments, the ordering of read sequences may be essential and \u201cAB\u201d and \u201cBA\u201d may not necessarily be synonymous). Similarly, if 5 read sequences are used (A, B, C, D, and E) in the population of nucleic acid probes, up to 10 probes may be separately identified (e.g., AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE). For example, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that, for k read sequences in a population with n read sequences on each probe, up to",

In addition, it should also be understood that the number of read sequences on each probe need not be identical in some embodiments. For instance example, some probes may contain 2 read sequences while other probes may contain 3 read sequences.",
                        "In some aspects, the read sequences and/or the pattern of binding of nucleic acid probes within a sample may be used to define an error-detecting and/or an error-correcting code, for example, to reduce or prevent misidentification or errors of the nucleic acids. Thus, for example, if binding is indicated (e.g., as determined using a signaling entity), then the location may be identified with a \u201c1\u201d; conversely, if no binding is indicated, then the location may be identified with a \u201c0\u201d (or vice versa, in some cases). Multiple rounds of binding determinations, e.g., using different nucleic acid probes, can then be used to create a \u201ccodeword,\u201d e.g., for that spatial location. In some embodiments, the codeword may be subjected to error detection and/or correction. For instance, the codewords may be organized such that, if no match is found for a given set of read sequences or binding pattern of nucleic acid probes, then the match may be identified as an error, and optionally, error correction may be applied sequences to determine the correct target for the nucleic acid probes. In some cases, the codewords may have fewer \u201cletters\u201d or positions that the total number of nucleic acids encoded by the codewords, e.g. where each codeword encodes a different nucleic acid.",

A variety of such codes have previously been developed in other contexts such as the telecommunications industry, such as Golay codes or Hamming codes. In one set of embodiments, the read sequences or binding patterns of the nucleic acid probes are assigned such that not every possible combination is assigned.",

If in each round, each target can give two possible outcomes, such as being detected or not being detected, up to 2n different targets may be possible for n rounds of probes, but the number of targets that are actually used may be any number less than 2n. For example, if in each round, each target can give more than two possible outcomes, such as being detected in different color channels, more than 2n (e.g. 3n, 4n, . . . ) different targets may be possible for n rounds of probes. In some cases, the number of targets that are actually used may be any number less than this number. In addition, these may be randomly assigned, or assigned in specific ways to increase the ability to detect and/or correct errors.",
                        "The codewords may be used to define various code spaces. For example, in one set of embodiments, the codewords or nucleic acid probes may be assigned within a code space such that the assignments are separated by a Hamming distance, which measures the number of incorrect \u201creads\u201d in a given pattern that cause the nucleic acid probe to be misinterpreted as a different valid nucleic acid probe. In certain cases, the Hamming distance may be at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, or the like. In addition, in one set of embodiments, the assignments may be formed as a Hamming code, for instance, a Hamming(7, 4) code, a Hamming(15, 11) code, a Hamming(31, 26) code, a Hamming(63, 57) code, a Hamming(127, 120) code, etc. In another set of embodiments, the assignments may form a SECDED code, e.g., a SECDED(8,4) code, a SECDED(16,4) code, a SCEDED(16, 11) code, a SCEDED(22, 16) code, a SCEDED(39, 32) code, a SCEDED(72, 64) code, etc. In yet another set of embodiments, the assignments may form an extended binary Golay code, a perfect binary Golay code, or a ternary Golay code. In another set of embodiments, the assignments may represent a subset of the possible values taken from any of the codes described above.",
                        "For example, an error-correcting code may be formed by using only binary words that contain a fixed or constant number of \u201c1\u201d bits (or \u201c0\u201d bits) to encode the targets. For example, the code space may only include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, etc. \u201c1\u201d bits (or \u201c0\u201d bits), e.g., all of the codes have the same number of \u201c1\u201d bits or \u201c0\u201d bits, etc. In another set of embodiments, the assignments may represent a subset of the possible values taken from codes described above for the purpose of addressing asymmetric readout errors. For example, in some cases, a code in which the number of \u201c1\u201d bits may be fixed for all used binary words may eliminate the biased measurement of words with different numbers of \u201cF\u201d s when the rate at which \u201c0\u201d bits are measured as \u201cF\u201d s or \u201c1\u201d bits are measured as \u201c0\u201ds are different.",
                        "Accordingly, in some embodiments, once the codeword is determined (e.g., as discussed herein), the codeword may be compared to the known nucleic acid codewords. If a match is found, then the nucleic acid target can be identified or determined. If no match is found, then an error in the reading of the codeword may be identified. In some cases, error correction can also be applied to determine the correct codeword, and thus resulting in the correct identity of the nucleic acid target. In some cases, the codewords may be selected such that, assuming that there is only one error present, only one possible correct codeword is available, and thus, only one correct identity of the nucleic acid target is possible. In some cases, this may also be generalized to larger codeword spacings or Hamming distances; for instance, the codewords may be selected such that if two, three, or four errors are present (or more in some cases), only one possible correct codeword is available, and thus, only one correct identity of the nucleic acid targets is possible.",

For instance, in one set of embodiments, more than one type of signaling entity may be used and assigned to different numbers within the error-correcting code. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a first signaling entity (or more than one signaling entity, in some cases) may be assigned as \u201c1\u201d and a second signaling entity (or more than one signaling entity, in some cases) may be assigned as \u201c2\u201d (with \u201c0\u201d indicating no signaling entity present), and the codewords distributed to define a ternary error-correcting code.

In some embodiments, the signaling entities may be fluorescent, and techniques for determining fluorescence within a sample, such as fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy, may be used to spatially identify the positions of signaling entities within a cell. In some cases, the positions of entities within the sample may be determined in two or even three dimensions. In addition, in some embodiments, more than one signaling entity may be determined at a time (e.g., signaling entities with different colors or emissions), and/or sequentially.",

                        "In another embodiment, the fluorophore may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide via one or more phosphorothioate modified nucleotides in which the sulfur modification replaces the bridging and/or non-bridging oxygen. The fluorophore may be cleaved from the oligonucleotide, in certain embodiments, via addition of compounds such as but not limited to iodoethanol, iodine mixed in ethanol, silver nitrate, or mercury chloride. In yet another set of embodiments, the signaling entity may be chemically inactivated through reduction or oxidation. For example, in one embodiment, a chromophore such as Cy5 or Cy7 may be reduced using sodium borohydride to a stable, non-fluorescence state. In still another set of embodiments, a fluorophore may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide via an azo bond, and the azo bond may be cleaved with 2-[(2-N-arylamino)phenylazo]pyridine. In yet another set of embodiments, a fluorophore may be conjugated to an oligonucleotide via a suitable nucleic acid segment that can be cleaved upon suitable exposure to DNAse, e.g., an exodeoxyribonuclease or an endodeoxyribonuclease. Examples include, but are not limited to, deoxyribonuclease I or deoxyribonuclease II. In one set of embodiments, the cleavage may occur via a restriction endonuclease. Non-limiting examples of potentially suitable restriction endonucleases include BamHI, BsrI, NotI, XmaI, PspAI, DpnI, MboI, MnlI, Eco57I, Ksp632I, DraIII, AhaII, SmaI, MluI, HpaI, ApaI, BclI, BstEII, TaqI, EcoRI, SacI, HindII, HaeII, DraII, Tsp509I, Sau3AI, PacI, etc. Over 3000 restriction enzymes have been studied in detail, and more than 600 of these are available commercially. In yet another set of embodiments, a fluorophore may be conjugated to biotin, and the oligonucleotide conjugated to avidin or streptavidin. An interaction between biotin and avidin or streptavidin allows the fluorophore to be conjugated to the oligonucleotide, while sufficient exposure to an excess of addition, free biotin could \u201coutcompete\u201d the linkage and thereby cause cleavage to occur. In addition, in another set of embodiments, the probes may be removed using corresponding \u201ctoe-hold-probes,\u201d which comprise the same sequence as the probe, as well as an extra number of bases of homology to the encoding probes (e.g., 1-20 extra bases, for example, 5 extra bases). These probes may remove the labeled readout probe through a strand-displacement interaction. The oligonucleotide sequence may be, for example, a primary or secondary (or other) amplifier nucleic acid, such as those discussed herein.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201clight\u201d generally refers to electromagnetic radiation, having any suitable wavelength (or equivalently, frequency). For instance, in some embodiments, the light may include wavelengths in the optical or visual range (for example, having a wavelength of between about 400 nm and about 700 nm, i.e., \u201cvisible light\u201d), infrared wavelengths (for example, having a wavelength of between about 300 micrometers and 700 nm), ultraviolet wavelengths (for example, having a wavelength of between about 400 nm and about 10 nm), or the like. In certain cases, as discussed in detail below, more than one entity may be used, i.e., entities that are chemically different or distinct, for example, structurally. However, in other cases, the entities may be chemically identical or at least substantially chemically identical.",
                        "In one set of embodiments, the signaling entity is \u201cswitchable,\u201d i.e., the entity can be switched between two or more states, at least one of which emits light having a desired wavelength. In the other state(s), the entity may emit no light, or emit light at a different wavelength. For instance, an entity may be \u201cactivated\u201d to a first state able to produce light having a desired wavelength, and \u201cdeactivated\u201d to a second state not able to emit light of the same wavelength. An entity is \u201cphotoactivatable\u201d if it can be activated by incident light of a suitable wavelength. As a non-limiting example, Cy5, can be switched between a fluorescent and a dark state in a controlled and reversible manner by light of different wavelengths, i.e., 633 nm (or 642 nm, 647 nm, 656 nm) red light can switch or deactivate Cy5 to a stable dark state, while 405 nm green light can switch or activate the Cy5 back to the fluorescent state. In some cases, the entity can be reversibly switched between the two or more states, e.g., upon exposure to the proper stimuli. For example, a first stimuli (e.g., a first wavelength of light) may be used to activate the switchable entity, while a second stimuli (e.g., a second wavelength of light) may be used to deactivate the switchable entity, for instance, to a non-emitting state. Any suitable method may be used to activate the entity. For example, in one embodiment, incident light of a suitable wavelength may be used to activate the entity to emit light, i.e., the entity is \u201cphotoswitchable.\u201d Thus, the photoswitchable entity can be switched between different light-emitting or non-emitting states by incident light, e.g., of different wavelengths. The light may be monochromatic (e.g., produced using a laser) or polychromatic. In another embodiment, the entity may be activated upon stimulation by electric field and/or magnetic field. In other embodiments, the entity may be activated upon exposure to a suitable chemical environment, e.g., by adjusting the pH, or inducing a reversible chemical reaction involving the entity, etc. Similarly, any suitable method may be used to deactivate the entity, and the methods of activating and deactivating the entity need not be the same. For instance, the entity may be deactivated upon exposure to incident light of a suitable wavelength, or the entity may be deactivated by waiting a sufficient time.",
                        "Typically, a \u201cswitchable\u201d entity can be identified by one of ordinary skill in the art by determining conditions under which an entity in a first state can emit light when exposed to an excitation wavelength, switching the entity from the first state to the second state, e.g., upon exposure to light of a switching wavelength, then showing that the entity, while in the second state can no longer emit light (or emits light at a much reduced intensity) when exposed to the excitation wavelength.",
                        "In one set of embodiments, as discussed, a switchable entity may be switched upon exposure to light. In some cases, the light used to activate the switchable entity may come from an external source, e.g., a light source such as a laser light source, another light-emitting entity proximate the switchable entity, etc. The second, light emitting entity, in some cases, may be a fluorescent entity, and in certain embodiments, the second, light-emitting entity may itself also be a switchable entity.",
                        "In some embodiments, the switchable entity includes a first, light-emitting portion (e.g., a fluorophore), and a second portion that activates or \u201cswitches\u201d the first portion. For example, upon exposure to light, the second portion of the switchable entity may activate the first portion, causing the first portion to emit light. Examples of activator portions include, but are not limited to, Alexa Fluor 405 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), Cy2 (GE Healthcare), Cy3 (GE Healthcare), Cy3B (GE Healthcare), Cy3.5 (GE Healthcare), or other suitable dyes. Examples of light-emitting portions include, but are not limited to, Cy5, Cy5.5 (GE Healthcare), Cy7 (GE Healthcare), Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 700 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 750 (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 790 (Invitrogen), DiD, DiR, YOYO-3 (Invitrogen), YO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen), TOT-3 (Invitrogen), TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) or other suitable dyes. These may linked together, e.g., covalently, for example, directly, or through a linker, e.g., forming compounds such as, but not limited to, Cy5-Alexa Fluor 405, Cy5-Alexa Fluor 488, Cy5-Cy2, Cy5-Cy3, Cy5-Cy3.5, Cy5.5-Alexa Fluor 405, Cy5.5-Alexa Fluor 488, Cy5.5-Cy2, Cy5.5-Cy3, Cy5.5-Cy3.5, Cy7-Alexa Fluor 405, Cy7-Alexa Fluor 488, Cy7-Cy2, Cy7-Cy3, Cy7-Cy3.5, Alexa Fluor 647-Alexa Fluor 405, Alexa Fluor 647-Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 647-Cy2, Alexa Fluor 647-Cy3, Alexa Fluor 647-Cy3.5, Alexa Fluor 750-Alexa Fluor 405, Alexa Fluor 750-Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 750-Cy2, Alexa Fluor 750-Cy3, or Alexa Fluor 750-Cy3.5. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of the structures of these and other compounds, many of which are available commercially. The portions may be linked via a covalent bond, or by a linker, such as those described in detail below. Other light-emitting or activator portions may include portions having two quaternized nitrogen atoms joined by a polymethine chain, where each nitrogen is independently part of a heteroaromatic moiety, such as pyrrole, imidazole, thiazole, pyridine, quinoine, indole, benzothiazole, etc., or part of a nonaromatic amine. In some cases, there may be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more carbon atoms between the two nitrogen atoms.",
                        "In certain cases, the light-emitting portion and the activator portions, when isolated from each other, may each be fluorophores, i.e., entities that can emit light of a certain, emission wavelength when exposed to a stimulus, for example, an excitation wavelength. However, when a switchable entity is formed that comprises the first fluorophore and the second fluorophore, the first fluorophore forms a first, light-emitting portion and the second fluorophore forms an activator portion that switches that activates or \u201cswitches\u201d the first portion in response to a stimulus. For example, the switchable entity may comprise a first fluorophore directly bonded to the second fluorophore, or the first and second entity may be connected via a linker or a common entity. Whether a pair of light-emitting portion and activator portion produces a suitable switchable entity can be tested by methods known to those of ordinary skills in the art. For example, light of various wavelength can be used to stimulate the pair and emission light from the light-emitting portion can be measured to determined wither the pair makes a suitable switch.",
                        "As a non-limiting example, Cy3 and Cy5 may be linked together to form such an entity. In this example, Cy3 is an activator portion that is able to activate Cy5, the light-emission portion. Thus, light at or near the absorption maximum (e.g., near 532 nm light for Cy3) of the activation or second portion of the entity may cause that portion to activate the first, light-emitting portion, thereby causing the first portion to emit light (e.g., near 647 nm for Cy5). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,838,302, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some cases, the first, light-emitting portion can subsequently be deactivated by any suitable technique (e.g., by directing 647 nm red light to the Cy5 portion of the molecule).",

Each of the secondary amplifier had a complimentary sequence to one of the 20-mer repeating sequences on primary amplifiers and N 20-mer repeating sequences that were complimentary to the final readout. After primary and secondary amplifiers staining, the original readout signal was one-to-one amplified N2-fold to the final readout signal. This amplification was termed as N\u00d7N amplification (FIGS. 1A-1E).",
                                "There were several notable advances in these amplifications. First, the amplifiers were designed using only three nucleotides. Probe sequences that contain only three of the four nucleotides had faster hybridization rates than sequences that use all four nucleotides. This is believed to be due to significantly less secondary structure in such sequences. In addition, to preserve the encoding probes binding to RNAs during amplifier staining and washing step, 20-mer binding sequences were used for amplifiers that stained and washed with 10% formamide at 37\u00b0 C. Encoding probes containing 30-mer targeting regions to RNAs were washed with 30% formamide at 47\u00b0 C. The amplification was performed on gel embedded and cleared MERFISH samples that inherited the ability to remove fluorescence background. See, e.g., Int. Pat. Apl. Pub.

In this example, to implement the design, encoding probes containing readout sequences were hybridized to filamin A (FLNA) mRNA and 5\u00d75 amplification was performed on the encoding probes in U-2 OS cells with 15 minutes per amplifier staining round. The average FLNA smFISH spots brightness of either direct labeling readout on encoding probes or labeling 5\u00d75 amplified with the readout on the encoding probe were measured. A 10.5 fold signal increase was observed, which achieved 42% of the theoretical value. See FIGS. 2A and 2B.",

A time series of the same 5\u00d75 amplification was conducted, with each round of amplifier staining with 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes (FIG. 2C). The results showed that the amplified signal was saturated with hybridized amplifiers within 15 minutes in each round. Saturation at 15 minutes indicates that full assembly of the amplifiers was very rapid, illustrating an additional advantage of the use of the three-letter alphabet for the design of the amplifier probes in this example. In comparison, other methods can often take 45 minutes or more per round of amplification.",

The spot size measurements of 4\u00d74 amplification, 5\u00d75 amplification and 9\u00d79 amplification were identical, as expected (FIG. 2E). Based on this design, the variation in brightness from spot to spot was not expected to increase substantially. To confirm this, the coefficient of variations of spot brightness was measured with unamplified, 4\u00d74 amplified, 5\u00d75 amplified, and 9\u00d79 amplified samples.

This approach was used to amplify a RNA smFISH signal to 5.5\u00d710.5\u00d7 and 30.6\u00d7 without spot size changes by using 4\u00d74 amplification, 5\u00d75 amplification and 9\u00d79 amplification, respectively. The coefficient of variations of spot brightness in unamplified, 4\u00d74 amplified, 5\u00d75 amplified and 9\u00d79 amplified samples were very close, indicating that the variation of the spot brightness did not increase during DNA amplification, which was important for MERFISH decoding. Finally, accurate identification and counting of 130 RNA species was demonstrated with a near 100% detection efficiency in amplified samples according to the ratio between the copy numbers measured in the amplified sample to those measured in the unamplified sample was 0.98.",
                                "It was observed that the amplification factors were around 40% of theoretical number for all three amplifications, including 4\u00d74, 5\u00d75, and 9\u00d79 amplification. It is believed that the amplifier and readout binding efficiencies were not 100%. The average binding rate per round was around 73.5%. In addition, 80% of the screened amplifier sets worked well, producing substantial amplification. The remaining 20% had either high background or low amplification efficiency. This probability of a amplifier set working without further refinement illustrates the ability to rapidly scale this approach to the amplification of a large number of readout sequences, which, in turn, will be useful for extending the multiplexing capacity.",
                                "Amplification was applied on an existing MERFISH library. The substantial increase in signal brightness generated by amplification should extend several additional applications of MERFISH. MERFISH measurements were performed using 92 encoding probes per RNA here. The increase in signal from this amplification approach should provide the possibility to detect RNAs that are much shorter, potentially RNAs that are as short as 300-mer length with as few as 10 encoding probes. The ability to detect RNA molecules with relatively few probes would also dramatically improve RNA isoforms discrimination. Second, MERFISH measurements used dynamic time, which is proportional to the imaged field of view (FOV) number, and a fixed readout staining, readout cleaving and washing time. Imaging time would dominate MERFISH throughput when the FOVs increased to a large number. It should be possible to substantially reduce the imaging duration with shorter exposure time by amplified signals, thus improving MERFISH throughput. In addition, spinning-disk confocal imaging gave higher contrast but less sensitive in detecting photons in thicker samples than wide-field microscopy. Thus, integration of amplification with MERFISH would facilitate the detection of FISH signals in tissues, e.g., with spinning-disk confocal microscopy."

Briefly, a 16-bit MHD4 code were used to encode the RNAs. In this encoding scheme, each of the 140 possible barcodes has a constant Hamming weight (i.e., the number of \u201c1\u201d bits in each barcode) of 4 to avoid potential bias in the measurement of different barcodes due to a differential rate of \u201c1\u201d to \u201c0\u201d and \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d errors. In addition, all barcodes have a Hamming distance of at least 4 to allow for error detection and error correction. 130 of the 140 possible barcodes were used to encode cellular RNAs, and 10 barcodes were used to serve as blank controls. In the encoding probe library, each RNA species contained 92 encoding probes, with each encoding probe containing three of the four readout sequences assigned to each RNA.",

Briefly, the oligopools (CustomArray) were amplified via limited-cycle PCR to make in vitro transcription templates first, converted and amplified into RNA through in vitro transcription (New England Biolabs), then converted the RNA back to DNA via reverse transcription (Maxima RT H-, Thermo Fisher). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Apl. Pub. No. 2017/0212986, incorporated herein by reference. Excess NTPs or dNTPs were removed via desalting columns (Thermo Fisher) after both the in vitro transcription and the phenol-chloroform extraction to improve the purity and reaction yield. The final DNA probes were purified via alkaline hydrolysis to remove RNA templates, phenol-chloroform extraction to remove proteins, and ethanol precipitation to concentrate probes. The final probes were resuspended in RNAase-free water and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C.",

The sample was aspirated to remove excess PA gel solution, then inverted onto the 50-microliter droplet to form a thin layer of PA between the coverslip and the glass plate without any bubbles. The coverslip and the glass plate was then gently separated after the gel cast for 1.5 h at room temperature, and the coverslip was washed twice with a digestion buffer of 2% (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 8 (Ambion), 1 mM EDTA (Ambion), and 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in nuclease-free water.

                                "MERFISH imaging platforms. The samples were imaged on a home-built high-throughput imaging platform at Center for Advanced Imaging, Harvard University. Briefly, this microscope was constructed around an Olympus IX-71 microscope body and a Nikon, CFI Plan Apo Lambda 60\u00d7 oil objective. Illumination in 750, 647, 560, 488 and 405 nm was provided using solid-state lasers (MBP Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-500-750-B1R; MBP Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-2000-647-B1R; MBP Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-2000-560-B1R; MBP Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-500-488-B1R; Coherent, Cube 405). These laser lines were used to excite readout probes labeled with Alexa750 and Cy5, orange fiducial beads, Poly dT readout and DAPI, respectively. The illumination profile was flattened with a \u03c0Shaper (Pishaper). The fluorescence emission from the sample was separated from the laser illumination using a penta-band dichroic (Chroma, zy405/488/561/647/752RP-UF1) and imaged with a scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS; Hamamatsu, C11440-22CU) after passing through two duplicate custom penta-notch filters (Chroma, ZET405/488/561/647-656/752m) to remove stray excitation light. The pixel size for the sCMOS camera was determined to correspond to 109 nm in the sample plane. The exposure time was 500 ms for each imaging frame. The sample position was controlled via a motorized microscope stage (Ludl) and focus was maintained via a custom focus-lock system realized through a feedback system between an objective nanopositioner (Mad City Labs, Nano-F100S) and the reflection of an IR laser (Thorlabs, LP980-SF15) onto a CMOS camera (Thorlabs, DCC1545M). The sample coverslip was held inside a flow chamber (Bioptechs, FCS2), and buffer exchange within this chamber was directed using a custom-built automated fluidics system, controlling three eight-way valves (Hamilton, MVP and HVXM 8-5) and a peristaltic pump (Gilison, Minipuls 3).",
                                "Sample imaging. Sequential MERFISH imaging was carried out on the high-throughput imaging platform described above. Briefly, each MERFISH round used readout probe staining (10 min), wash buffer washing (5 min), imaging buffer flowing (3 min), 100-400 FOVs imaging, readout fluorophore cleaving (15 min), and 2\u00d7SSC washing (5 min). 8 rounds of two color MERFISH imaging were performed on each sample. Specifically, the readout probes staining was done by flowing 3 nM readout probes in hybridization buffer of 2\u00d7SSC, 10% (vol/vol) ethylene carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% (vol/vol) murine RNase inhibitor (NEB) in nuclease-free water. Wash buffer contained 2\u00d7SSC and 10% (vol/vol) ethylene carbonate in nuclease-free water. The imaging buffer used 2\u00d7SSC, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10% (wt/vol) glucose, 2 mM Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), 40 micrograms/mL catalase (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% (vol/vol) murine RNase inhibitor in nuclease-free water. Cleavage buffer comprising 2\u00d7SSC and 50 mM of Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP; Sigma) was used to cleave the disulfide bond conjugating dyes to the probes. SmFISH imaging was similar to single round MERFISH imaging but without cleaving and 2\u00d7SSC washing steps.",
                                "Image processing and decoding. For FLNA smFISH data, the brightness and PSF sizes of unamplied and amplified FISH spots were calculated via a Gaussian fitting routine. For the MERFISH data, registration of images of the same FOV across different imaging rounds as well as decoding of the RNA barcodes was conducted as follows. Briefly, the offsets between images in each imaging round were corrected using the localizations of the fiducial beads in each round of imaging. Next, background in the images were removed with a high-pass filter, RNA spots were tightened by deconvolution, and RNA centroids that differed slightly in location between images were connected via low-pass filter. Then the brightness of RNA spot different color channels were normalized by equalizing their intensity histograms via an iterative process. By comparing the normalized intensity of each pixel across all the 16 images in 8 two-color rounds, the barcodes were assigned to individual pixels.",

Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the \u201cand/or\u201d clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to \u201cA and/or B\u201d, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as \u201ccomprising\u201d can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.",

For example, when separating items in a list, \u201cor\u201d or \u201cand/or\u201d shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as \u201conly one of\u201d or \u201cexactly one of,\u201d or, when used in the claims, \u201cconsisting of,\u201d will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term \u201cor\u201d as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. \u201cone or the other but not both\u201d) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as \u201ceither,\u201d \u201cone of,\u201d \u201conly one of,\u201d or \u201cexactly one of.\u201d",

This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase \u201cat least one\u201d refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, \u201cat least one of A and B\u201d (or, equivalently, \u201cat least one of A or B,\u201d or, equivalently \u201cat least one of A and/or B\u201d) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.",
