Based on this surprising discovery, the inventors developed a novel approach for generating an infectious RNA virus which does not require cloning and propagation of a full-length cDNA into bacteria.",

Unlike the other bacterium free approaches, disclosed in prior art, the method of the invention does not require any additional step beside preparation of cDNA fragments. The assembly of the construct is not made in vitro by Gibson assembly or circular polymerase extension cloning before the transfection but through a recombination process that directly takes place in cellulo which greatly facilitates and shortens the methodology.",

Such fragments correspond to \u201csubgenomic fragments\u201d. The inventors enlightened that, when such fragments are transfected within a cell, they surprisingly spontaneously recombine in cellulo to reconstitute the entire viral genome. Said recombination occurs even if the viral genome is not genetically modified to incorporate additional and not naturally occurring recombination site.

Their working hypothesis was that transfection of overlapping double-stranded DNA fragments, covering the entire genome of an RNA virus, into permissive cells would spontaneously enable recombination and synthesis of a DNA copy of the complete viral genome. By including at the 5\u2032 terminus of the first (5\u2032) DNA fragment, a promoter of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and at the 3\u2032 terminus of the last (3\u2032) DNA fragment a ribozyme sequence and a signal sequence for RNA poly-adenylation, the inventors anticipated that this genomic DNA copy would be transcribed as a full-length RNA genome with authentic 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini that would be efficiently exported out of the nucleus (in the case of a virus replicating in the cytoplasmic compartment).",
                                "The inventors first tested this hypothesis with 6 flaviviruses (i.e., arthropod-borne enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells) that represent major flaviviral evolutionary lineages: two Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV; genotype I (JEV I) and genotype III (JEV III)), one genotype 2 West Nile virus (WNV), one serotype 4 dengue virus (DENV-4), one wild-type strain of Yellow fever virus (YFV) and one Far-Eastern subtype Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (Table 1).",
                                "Entire genomes were amplified by PCR in 3 DNA fragments of approximately 4 kb, each with 70-100 bp overlapping regions. The first and last fragments were flanked respectively in 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 by the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (HDR/SV40 pA) (FIG. 1). PCR products were column-purified, and 1 \u03bcg of an equimolar mix of all fragments was transfected into SW13 and/or BHK-21 cell lines, which, ensure efficient recovery of flaviviral infectious genomes. Cell supernatant media from these infectious cultures were serially passaged four times using the same cell types, enabling the isolation of JEV I, JEV III, TBEV and WNV. For more demanding viruses, isolation could be achieved by passaging in additional permissive cells (e.g., DENV-4: VeroE6 cells; YFV: HEK-293 cells). Virus replication after four serial passages was demonstrated for each virus using a combination of the following criteria:\n\n\n- - (i) production of viral genomes in cell supernatant medium using\n    real time RT-PCR methods,\n  - (ii) production of infectious particles in cell supernatant medium\n    using TCID50 assays,\n  - (iii) detection of cytopathic effect (CPE),\n  - (iv) detection of viral antigens by direct immunofluorescence\n    assays, and\n  - (v) complete viral genome sequencing using next generation\n    sequencing (NGS) method.",
                                "The robustness, flexibility and versatility of the methods were further challenged as follows. Firstly, the inventors decreased the size and increased the number of overlapping fragments combined for transfection. This was exemplified in the case of JEV I, for which the ISA method generated infectious viruses, when using up to 6 overlapping amplicons of approximately 2 kb. Secondly, they applied the ISA method to viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that belong to different families: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV, an enveloped virus, family Togaviridae) and Coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3, a nonenveloped virus, family Picornaviridae). Again, infectious viruses could be isolated following transfection and four passages in HEK-293 cells (CHIKV) or BGM cells (CV-B3) (Table 2 under). Furthermore, the inventors used as a control the CV-B3 obtained following transfection of a plasmid-bearing infectious genome and they obtained similar results in terms of infectivity and sequence data (Table 2).",
                                "Summary of the different viruses produced in this study: the specific name of the strain, the origin of the initial material (DNS, De Novo Synthesis; I.C., Infectious Clone; or Viral RNA) used as the template for production of the first (I), second (II) and third (III) fragment, the cell line used for the transfection and the passages, the relative quantification of the amount of viral RNA and infectious titres in cell supernatants at the fourth passage by real time RT-PCR and TCID50 assay, the presence or absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) as well as the research of viral antigens by direct immunofluorescence assay (dIFA). Complete viral genome sequences were obtained using NGS technology. dN and dS correspond respectively to the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site and the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site. * Results obtained by transfection of six overlapping fragments. \u00b6 Results obtained by transfecting directly the CV-B3 plasmid-bearing infectious clone. N/A and AU mean not available and arbitrary unit respectively.",
                                "Thirdly, the inventors demonstrated the capability of ISA method to generate genetically modified viruses in days. This was exemplified by the PCR-based correction of a frame-shift mutation (1915del) in fragment one of a defective JEV III infectious clone and the subsequent recovery of the corresponding virus (Supplementary Methods). They were also able to produce chimeric viruses by exchanging the first DNA fragment (encoding structural proteins) of genotype I and III JEVs. Despite 11 mismatches in the overlapping region of the first two fragments, transfection resulted in the production of intergenotypic JEV I/JEV III and JEV III/JEV I chimeras. Analysis of complete genomic sequences established at the fourth passage, using NGS, showed that the genetic drift (rate of sequence change) was modest (ranging from 1.45E-03 to 9.00E-05 substitutions per site when considering fixed mutations). A majority of non-synonymous mutations, the presence of shared mutations amongst the different JEV strains (7/85), and the non-random distribution of mutations (at frequency above 10%) along the genome (with both hot spots and highly conserved regions) denoted adaptation to the cell culture conditions.",
                                "The mutation rate varied according to the cells used for isolation and, as expected, was higher in viruses derived from low-passage strains than in those derived from culture-adapted strains. In conclusion, the ISA method is a very simple procedure with which to expedite production of infectious genetically modified RNA viruses within days, with perfect control of the viral sequences and starting from a variety of initial sources including pre-existing infectious clones, viral RNA or de novo synthesized DNA genomic sequences. This technique has the future potential to generate the design of large reverse genetics experiments for RNA viruses, on a scale that could not previously have been considered. It also has the capacity, specifically to modulate the characteristics of the viruses recovered from experimental procedures. Additionally, because DNA subgenomic fragments can conveniently be obtained by PCR, this method has the potential to conserve the genetic diversity of viral populations13 when starting from viral RNA. Error-prone PCR may be also be used to create artificial viral heterogeneity, e.g. for facilitating the selection of adapted viruses15 under various experimental selection conditions and, conversely, high-fidelity polymerases and clonal amplification templates may be used to control the degree of clonality of the viruses produced.",
                                "Finally, the method of the invention has the potential to revolutionise the safety and security of future exchanges of RNA viruses between scientific institutions, by the separate shipment at room temperature of simple, on-infectious, DNA subgenomic fragments that, could then be combined and transfected by the recipient institute, enabling rapid, simple and safe recovery of the infectious viral strain."
