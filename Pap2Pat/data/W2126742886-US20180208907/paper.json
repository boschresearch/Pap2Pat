                "Development of molecular methods that enable production of infectious virus from DNA copies of their genomes has significantly improved our knowledge of RNA virus life cycles and pathogenesis, by permitting the development of \u2018reverse genetics\u2019, i.e. studies of the impact of specific mutations on the biological properties of viruses (Gorchakov et al., 2012; Ruggli & Rice, 1999). However, current methodologies for construction of infectious cDNA clones are unpredictable and laborious processes frequently associated with undesirable mutations or unstable/toxic clones in bacteria (Ruggli & Rice, 1999). Various methodological improvements, such as the use of alternative hosts (Cs\u00f6rgo et al., 2012; Polo et al., 1997; Schoggins et al., 2012), low-copy-number plasmids (Bredenbeek et al., 2003; Gritsun & Gould, 1998), cosmid vectors (Zhang et al., 2001), bacterial artificial chromosomes (Suzuki et al., 2007), modified promoters (Mishin et al., 2001) or modified viral genome sequences with reduced cryptic bacterial promoter activity (Pu et al., 2011) have been proposed. More recently, a new method was described to propagate flavivirus infectious cDNA clones in bacteria by introducing tandem repeat sequences upstream of virus genome (Pu et al., 2014). Bacterium-free approaches have also been developed, for example with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) by Gritsun & Gould (1995) and with West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV) by Edmonds et al. (2013) and Siridechadilok et al. (2013), respectively. Although they represented significant advances, these methods require substantial optimization for each virus studied and do not provide a unified methodological process.",
                "In the current study, we describe a simple and versatile reverse genetics method designated ISA (infectious-subgenomic-amplicons) that facilitates the rescue of infectious RNA viruses from genomic DNA material without requiring cloning, propagation of cDNA into bacteria or in vitro RNA transcription. Our working hypothesis was that transfection of overlapping double-stranded DNA fragments, covering the entire genome of an RNA virus, into susceptible animal cells would spontaneously enable recombination and synthesis of a DNA copy of the complete viral genome. By including at the 5\u2032 terminus of the first (5\u2032) DNA fragment a promoter of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and at the 3\u2032 terminus of the last (3\u2032) DNA fragment a ribozyme sequence and a signal sequence for RNA poly-adenylation, we anticipated that this genomic DNA copy would be transcribed as a full-length RNA genome with authentic 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini that would be efficiently exported out of the nucleus (in the case of a virus replicating in the cytoplasmic compartment)."

                "We first tested this hypothesis with six flaviviruses (i.e. arthropod-borne enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells) that represent major flaviviral evolutionary lineages. We used two Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEVs), genotype I (JEV I) and genotype III (JEV III), one genotype 2 WNV, one serotype-4 DENV, one wild-type (WT) strain of Yellow fever virus (YFV) and one Far-Eastern subtype TBEV (Table 1). Entire genomes were amplified by PCR in three DNA fragments of approximately 4 kb, each with 70\u2013100 bp overlapping regions. The first and last fragments were flanked respectively at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 by the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal (HDR/SV40pA) (Fig. 1). PCR products were column-purified, and 1 \u00b5g of an equimolar mix of all fragments was transfected into human adrenal carcinoma (SW13) and/or baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 cell lines, which, in our experience, ensure efficient recovery of flaviviral infectious genomes. Cell supernatant media from these infectious cultures were serially passaged four times using the same cell types, enabling the isolation of JEV I, JEV III, TBEV and WNV. For more demanding viruses, isolation could be achieved by passaging in additional permissive cells, such as DENV-4 in African green monkey kidney (VeroE6) cells or YFV in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Virus replication after four serial passages was demonstrated for each virus using a combination of the following criteria: (i) production of viral genomes in cell supernatant medium using real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR methods, (ii) production of infectious particles in cell supernatant medium using TCID50 assays, (iii) detection of cytopathic effect (CPE), (iv) detection of viral antigens by direct immunofluorescence assays and (v) complete viral genome sequencing using the next generation sequencing (NGS) method (Fig. S1 available in the online Supplementary Material, Table 1). Four passages were made for each virus produced using the ISA method to ensure the complete disappearance of the DNA used during the transfection.",
                "The robustness, flexibility and versatility of the methods were further challenged as follows.",
                "Firstly, we decreased the size and increased the number of overlapping fragments combined for transfection. This was exemplified in the case of JEV I, for which the ISA method generated infectious viruses, when using up to six overlapping amplicons of approximately 2 kb.",
                "Secondly, we applied the ISA method to viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that belong to different families: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV, an enveloped virus, family Togaviridae) and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3, a non-enveloped virus, family Picornaviridae). Again, infectious viruses could be isolated following transfection and four passages in HEK-293 cells (CHIKV) or Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cells (CV-B3) (Table 1). Furthermore, we used the CV-B3 obtained following transfection of a plasmid-bearing infectious genome as a control, and we obtained similar results in terms of infectivity and sequence data (Table 1).",
                "Thirdly, we demonstrated the capability of the ISA method to generate genetically modified viruses in days. This was exemplified by the PCR-based correction of a frame-shift mutation (1915del) in fragment one of a defective JEV III infectious clone and the subsequent recovery of the corresponding virus (Supplementary Methods). We were also able to produce chimeric viruses by exchanging the first DNA fragment (encoding structural proteins) of genotype I and III JEVs. Despite 11 mismatches in the overlapping region of the first two fragments, transfection resulted in the production of inter-genotypic JEV I/JEV III and JEV III/JEV I chimeras (Table 1).",
                "Analysis of complete genomic sequences established at the fourth passage, using NGS, showed that the genetic drift (rate of sequence change) was modest (ranging from 1.45\u00d710\u22123 to 9.00\u00d710\u22125 substitutions per site when considering fixed mutations) (Table 1). A majority of non-synonymous mutations, the presence of shared mutations amongst the different JEV strains (7/85, Table S1), and the non-random distribution of mutations at a frequency above 10\u200a% along the genome, with both hot spots and highly conserved regions (Fig. S2), denoted adaptation to the cell culture conditions. The mutation rate varied according to the cells used for isolation, and as expected, was higher in viruses derived from low-passage strains than in those derived from culture-adapted strains.",
                "In conclusion, the ISA method is a simple procedure with which to expedite production of infectious WT or genetically modified animal RNA viruses within days, with great control of the viral sequences and starting from a variety of initial sources including pre-existing infectious clones, viral RNA or de novo synthesized DNA genomic sequences. Unlike other bacterium-free approaches, the ISA method does not require any additional steps beside the PCR amplification needed to obtain the different cDNA fragments. The assembly of the construct is not produced in vitro by Gibson assembly or circular polymerase extension cloning before the transfection, but by in cellulo recombination, which greatly facilitates and shortens the method. Such an in cellulo recombination process was previously proposed in the case of plant viruses (Marillonnet et al., 2004), but the in planta method proposed was quite different since (i) DNA fragments were provided in the form of plasmids; (ii) they were not transfected, but brought by agroinfiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana by a mix of Agrobacterium strains carrying provector plasmids; and (iii) a site-specific recombination was used that required the introduction of a specific sequence within the construct.",
                "This novel technique has the potential to generate the design of large reverse genetics experiments for RNA viruses on a scale that could not previously have been considered (i.e. generating dozens or even hundreds of modified viruses at the same time). It also has the capacity, specifically, to modulate the characteristics of the viruses recovered from experimental procedures. Additionally, because DNA subgenomic fragments can conveniently be obtained by PCR, this method allows the conservation of the genetic diversity of viral populations (Edmonds et al., 2013) when starting from viral RNA. Error-prone PCR may also be used to create artificial viral heterogeneity, e.g. for facilitating the selection of adapted viruses (Bacher et al., 2002) under various experimental selection conditions, and conversely, high-fidelity polymerases and clonal amplification templates may be used to control the degree of clonality of the viruses produced. Finally, the ISA method has the potential to profoundly improve the safety and security of future exchanges of RNA viruses between scientific institutions by the separate shipment at room temperature of simple, non-infectious, DNA subgenomic fragments that could then be combined and transfected by the recipient institute, enabling rapid, simple and safe recovery of the infectious viral strain."
