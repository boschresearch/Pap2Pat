    "abstract": "A telecommunications control apparatus is included in each of a plurality of nodes constituting a telecommunications system and includes a reception power decider for determining the reception power value of a control signal received from another node. A control signal decider decides, in accordance with the reception power value of the control signal thus determined, whether or not the own node should communicate with the other node in relation to interference at the own node.

                        "The present invention relates to a telecommunications control apparatus and a method therefor, and more specifically to a telecommunications control apparatus configured to avoid the conflict of data, otherwise due to radio interference or similar cause, which are transmitted and received between a number of nodes that are spatially distributed in a sensor network, LAN (Local Area Network) or similar system or mounted on mobile bodies.",
                        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
                        "As systems for allowing a plurality of spatially distributed nodes to transmit and receive data without any conflict, available are the time division multiple access (TDMA) system and the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) system, such as a CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) system and a CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) system, as taught in Y. Matsushita, et al., \u201cWireless LAN Architecture\u201d, pp. 47, 53-59 and 69, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, 1996.",
                        "The TDMA system, for example, allots a particular time slot to each of a plurality of nodes so as to cause each node to transmit data only in the time slot allotted thereto, and allows the number of channels available for communication at the same time to be increased more easily than the CSMA system. When nodes expected to communicate with each other dynamically change, a certain node plays the role of a central or management node for dynamically allotting time slots to the other nodes. However, a problem with the TDMA system is that, when the central node expected to allot time slots malfunctions, the entire telecommunications system goes down.",
                        "In order to solve the above problem, there have been proposed various methods practicable without resorting to a central node, i.e., allowing the individual node to allot time slots in a distributed coordination control fashion for mutual adjustment for thereby avoiding data collisions. That is, the individual nodes interact with each other by transmitting and receiving periodic impulse signals.",
                        "More specifically, to adjust the allotment of time slots in the distributed coordination manner, each node controls, by using nonlinear oscillation, the timing for transmitting an impulse signal in response to the timing of impulse signal transmission from another node such that the impulse signal from the own node and the impulse signal from another node are spaced in timing from each other as far as possible.",
                        "Further, the methods stated above include a mode in which the interaction between the nodes is continuous in addition to the mode in which it is discrete. To implement the continuous interaction mode, as distinguished from the discrete interaction mode, phase signals are continuously transmitted and received between nodes so as to establish an adequate phase relation for thereby realizing time slot acquisition in the distribution coordination manner.",
                        "Moreover, each node generates, as the phase of a virtual node, an estimated communication timing value of another node as the phase of a virtual node on the basis of interaction using impulse and then establishes an adequate phase relation through interaction with the virtual node, also realizing time slot acquisition in the distribution coordination manner.",
                        "As stated above, the conventional methods execute timing control by relaying an impulse signal, or control message, instead of assuming two different kinds of communication ranges, i.e., a communication range and an interaction.",
                        "Although the conventional methods stated above allow communication to be efficiently held between nodes without any collision of received signals after the establishment of an adequate phase relation or conversion, the problem is that they cannot always establish a phase relation between adequate nodes and hence an adequate communication timing, depending on the characteristic of radio communication. For example, in the case of wired communication, when a plurality of nodes, sharing the same communication channels, start transmitting signals at the same time, the signals collide with each other and cause both data to disappear with the result that a receiving node cannot correctly receive data. By contrast, in the case of wireless communication, only if reception power is sufficiently great, the receiving node can receive data with great reception power even when a plurality of nodes start transmitting signals at the same time."

                        "More specifically, assume that, when a certain node is expected to receive a radio signal transmitted from a source node which is away from the node by a distance of d, the radio signal has reception power of Ps, that a radio signal sent from a point which is away from the node by a distance of Ri is an interference signal, and that the interference signal has reception power, or interference power, of Pi. Then, the SIR is expressed as:",

As shown, while a node j lies in both the communicable range of a node i and the communicable range of a node k, the node j can receive a signal from the node j even when the nodes i and k transmit signals at the same time. Stated another way, so long as the node i does not communicate with a node ling in its communication range Rt, a signal collision ascribable to radio interference does not occur between the node i and a node lying within a distance of D2 from the node i.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2, the node of the illustrative embodiment is shown in a schematic block diagram. As shown, the node, generally 10, is made up of an impulse signal receiver 11, a communication timing calculator 12, an impulse signal transmitter 13, a tuning decider 14, a data signal transmitter/receiver 15, a sensor 16 and a control signal decider 17, which are interconnected as illustrated. In the illustrative embodiment, the impulse signal receiver 11, transmission timing calculator 12, impulse signal transmitter 13, control signal decider 17 and tuning decider 14 constitute a telecommunication control apparatus in combination.",

The impulse signal received from the neighboring node does not convey destination information. It is to be noted that an impulse signal refers to a signal transmitted and received as a transmission timing signal and has its impulse waveform of a Gaussian or similar distribution. The impulse signal may convey some data information, if desired. A received impulse signal Spr11, which will be described later, may be an impulse signal resulting from shaping the waveform of the received impulse signal Sin11 or an impulse signal regenerated from the received impulse signal Sin11.",
                        "The control signal decider 17 is configured to receive the received impulse signal 51, or a control signal as sometimes referred to hereinafter, from the impulse signal receiver 11 and determine, in accordance with a reception power value at the time of receipt of the impulse signal, whether or not communication timing adjustment or control should be executed in response to the impulse signal or control signal. With this configuration, the control signal decider 17 is capable of selecting an impulse signal or control signal received from a node necessary for the transmission timing calculator 12 to determine a transmission timing for thereby accurately determining a node to which communication timing adjustment should be applied. In the following, signals are designated with reference numerals of connections on which they are conveyed.",

In the illustrative embodiment, the transmission timing calculator 12 is assumed to generate and output the phase signal Spr12 even when the received impulse signal Spr11 is absent.",
                        "Assuming that the phase signal of a node of interest i has a value of \u03b8i(t) at a time t, then the transmission timing calculator 12 varies, in response to the received impulse signal Spr11, the phase signal Spr12(=\u03b8i(t)) with a nonlinear oscillation rhythm, as represented by expressions (6) and (7):",

                        "The above variation of the phase signal realizes a nonlinear characteristic that causes nearby nodes to tend to become opposite in phase (inversion of an oscillation phase) to each other, and uses such a characteristic to avoid collisions. More specifically, in order to prevent the transmission timings of impulse signals Sout11 sent out from neighboring nodes from colliding with each other, the illustrative embodiment establishes a suitable time relation or time lag into a timing at which the phase signals of those nodes take the same value.",
                        "Various factors included in the expressions (6) and (7) will be briefly described hereinafter. The expression (6) is representative of a rule for varying the nonlinear oscillation rhythm of the phase signal \u03b8i(t) of the own node i (generally referred to as a time evolution rule). In the expression (6), parameters t and i are respectively representative of time and the phase of nonlinear oscillation of the own node at a time t while, in the expression (7), \u0394\u03b8ij(t) is a phase difference produced by subtracting the phase \u03b8i(t) of the own node i from the phase \u03b8j(t) of a neighboring node j.",
                        "Further, in the expression (6), \u03c9 denotes a specific angular frequency parameter. The function Pj(t) is representative of an impulse signal received from the neighboring node j. The function R(\u0394\u03b8ij(t)) is a phase response function expressing a response characteristic that causes the basic rhythm of the own node i to vary in response to an impulse signal Spr11 received from another node. N denotes the total number of neighboring nodes present in a spatial distance range over which the own node i can receive an impulse signal Spr11. The function \u03be(Si(t)) is a term that stores stresses when the relative phase difference between the own node i and the neighboring node j is small, and shifts the phase by a random size in accordance with a stored stress value Si(t).",
                        "The functional principle of the transmission timing calculator 12 will be described more specifically with reference to FIGS. 3A through 3C and 4A through 4C. It is to be noted that the function of the impulse signal transmitter 12 also relates to state transitions shown in FIGS. 3A through 4C. Paying attention to a given node, FIGS. 3A through 4C demonstrate a relation between the node of interest or own node i and another node or neighboring node j, i.e., how a phase relation between the nonlinear oscillation rhythms of the nodes i and j varies with the elapse of time. The angles of the material points i and j on the circle are representative of the instantaneous values of phase signals. The circular movements of the material points i and j are projected onto the ordinate or the abscissa to represent the respective nonlinear oscillation rhythms.",
                        "The two material points i and j tend to become opposite in phase to each other in accordance with the operation represented by the expression (1), which will be described specifically later. As a result, even when the phases of the two material points i and j are close to each other, as shown in FIG. 3A, the state varies as the time elapses via a transitional state shown in FIG. 3B to a stable state shown in FIG. 3C in which the phase difference between the two points i and j is substantially equal to \u03c0.",
                        "The two material points i and j rotate at the primary angular velocity equal to the respective specific angular oscillation frequency parameter \u03c9. When the two nodes become interactive in response to impulse signals transmitted therebetween, the two material points i and j vary the angular velocity thereof ahead or behind so as to ultimately establish the stable state at which the appropriate relation is maintained. This operation may be considered to indicate that the two points i and j repel each other while rotating to establish the stable phase relation. In the stable state, FIG. 3C, if each of the two nodes is adapted to transmit the output impulse signal Sout11, FIG. 2, when it is in a predetermined phase, e.g., zero, then both nodes are brought into the transmission timing to establish the appropriate timing relation with each other.",
                        "FIGS. 4A, 4B and 4C show another specific case wherein the own node i and two neighboring nodes j1 and j2 exist together. In this case, too, the material points i, j1 and j2 repel each other while in rotation, establishing the stable phase relation with respect to time. This is also true when three or more nodes neighbor the node of interest i.",
                        "The stable phase relation or stable state thus established is, in nature, remarkably adaptive to a change in the number of neighboring nodes, i.e. remarkably flexible. For example, assume that, when a single node j1 neighbors the node of interest i in a stable phase relation or stable state, another neighboring node j2 is added. Then, although the stable state is once disturbed, a new stable state is again established with the node of interest i and two neighboring nodes j1 and j 2 via a transitional or transient state. This is also true when either one of the neighboring nodes j1 and j2 disappears or fails due to an error or similar cause occurring therein.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 2, the phase signal Spr12 equal to \u03b8i(t) output from the transmission timing calculator 12 is fed to the impulse signal transmitter 13, tuning decider 14 and data signal transmitter 15, as stated previously. The impulse signal transmitter 13 is adapted for transmitting an output impulse signal Sout11 to the network in response to the phase signal Spr12. More specifically, when the phase signal Spr12 reaches a predetermined phase \u03b1 lying in the range of 0\u2266\u03b1<2\u03c0, the transmission timing calculator 12 commands the impulse signal transmitter 13 to transmit an output impulse signal. The predetermined phase \u03b1 should preferably be uniform in the entire telecommunications system and will be assumed to be zero hereinafter. In the state shown in FIG. 3C, because the phase signals of the nodes i and j locally differ in phase from each other by n in the stable state, the transmission timings of output impulse signals Sout11 from the node i and j are shifted from each other by n despite that a is uniform in the entire system.",
                        "The tuning decider 14 is configured to determine whether the mutual adjustment of the transmission timings of the output impulse signals, which is executed at the own node or between one or more neighboring nodes, is in the transition state shown in FIG. 3B or whether it is in the stable state shown in FIG. 3C or 4C. More specifically, by monitoring the timing at which the received timing signal Spr11, corresponding to an output impulse signal Sout11 sent out from another node, is generated and the timing at which the output impulse signal Sout11 is generated, the tuning decider 14 determines that the above mutual adjustment is in the stable state if a time lag between the generation timings of a plurality of nodes that transmit and receive impulse signals is stable with respect to time. In the illustrative embodiment, the phase signal Spr12 is input to the tuning decider 14 instead of the output impulse signal Sout11 as a signal that allows the decider 14 to grasp the generation timing of the output impulse signal Sout11 from the own node.",
                        "To make the above decision on tuning, the transmission timing calculator 12 may execute the following specific sequence of steps. The transmission timing calculator 14 monitors, over a single period of the phase signal Spr12, the value \u03b2 of the phase signal Spr12 occurring at the input timing of the received impulse signal Spr11 from the control signal decider 17. Assume that the values \u03b2 of the phase signal Spr12 thus monitored are \u03b21, \u03b22, . . . , \u03b2N(0<\u03b21<\u03b22< . . . <\u03b2N<2\u03c0). The transmission timing calculator 12 then calculates, based on the monitored values \u03b2, differences between nearby values, i.e., phase differences \u03941=\u03b21, \u03942=\u03b22\u2212\u03b21, . . . , \u0394N=\u03b2N\u2212\u03b2(N\u22121).",

Why the minimum value \u03b21 is output as a slot signal Spr14, as stated above, is related to the parameter \u03b2 which is assumed to be zero, so that the value of \u03b2 to be applied to the slot signal Spr14 varies in accordance with the value of \u03b1.",

It should be noted that the time slot mentioned above is used for the sake of description although it differs from a fixed time interval assigned by, e.g., a system.

When the error rate, for example, is higher than a preselected threshold value, the parameter corrector 26 may correct the parameters in such a manner as to reduce the distance D2. A time constant with which a high error rate continues may be made longer than a time constant with which the timing control system executed by the transmission timing calculator 12, FIG. 2, converges, so that stable operation can be implemented.",

Then, the response control signal generator 34 writes the reception power value of \u221280 dBm in the response impulse signal. The response impulse signal 63 thus generated by the response control signal generator 34 is fed to the control signal transmitter 36 and then transmitted thereby.",

In response, the interference decider 33 sees that immunity to interference of up to \u221280 dBm is written in the response impulse signal, and determines that, if power to reach the node or source B transmitted the response impulse signal is greater than the value written in the response impulse signal, transmission from the own node C would cause interference to occur at the node B during communication between the nodes A and B. The interference decider 33 then reports the receipt of the impulse signal to the transmission timing calculator 12, FIG. 2.",

In the illustrative embodiment described first, it is assumed that the own node writes in an impulse signal a reception power value liable to bring about interference and that transmission timing control is executed between the above node and a node capable of receiving an impulse signal with a greater reception power value. However, the present invention is applicable not only to a telecommunications system using an impulse signal but also to other telecommunication systems because it autonomously determines a range in which transmission from a node brings about interference and a range in which transmission from a node to another node suffers from interference.",

For example, when a node A transmits an RTS message to a node B while the node B transmits a CTS message, the node B writes in the CTS message a reception power value based on the reception power value of the RTS message and then transmits the CTS message in accordance with the present invention. In this case, a node C, having received the CTS message from the node B, can determine whether or not transmission from the node C would interfere with communication between the nodes A and B in accordance with the present invention and can therefore decide whether or not it should really hold back from transmitting a signal.",
                                "It has been customary to hold back from transmitting a signal when a control signal is received without exception without regard to the reception power value. By contrast, by applying the present invention, it is possible to execute strict control over conflicts not on the basis of whether or not a control signal has arrived but on the basis of power strength actually arrived.",
                                "While the communication timing calculator 12 included in the illustrative embodiments uses a differential expression represented by the expression (6), the differential expression is merely an example of an expression that defines a calculating method and may, of course, be replaced with a difference expression or recursion formula obtainable by differentiating the expression (6), i.e., by making the continuous time parameter t discrete.",
                                "As for other methods of description, there are available a general, nonlinear oscillation or chaos oscillation model represented by, e.g., van del Pol equation, as taught in Morikazu Toda et al. \u201cNonlinear Dynamics\u201d, Kyoritsu Shuppan Co., Ltd., Japan. Of course, such oscillation can be implemented when interaction between nodes is either discrete with respect to time, i.e., pulse-like or continuous. The van del Pol equation models a nonlinear oscillation phenomenon to occur on electric circuitry. Operations based on the van del Pol equation may be mounted on a node as hardware by use of electric circuitry or as software by use of Runge-Kutta method or similar numerical calculating method in general use.",
                                "The present invention is not dependent on time, operation status or difference between the methods of describing individual models, e.g., a discrete model and a continuous model or other models each expressing a respective oscillation phenomenon, but can be implemented by using various models each having a particular operation status that varies in accordance with a certain, time evolution rule. Arrangements using models whose operation statuses vary either periodically or chaotically are other embodiments of the present invention.",
                                "While the embodiment described first is applied to a system in which a number of spatially distributed nodes transmit and receive data therebetween on radio, the present invention is similarly applicable to, e.g., Ethernet (trademark) or similar LAN system in which such nodes transmit and receive data over wired connections. Also, the present invention is applicable to a network in which different kinds of nodes, e.g., sensors and actuators or severs are connected together by wire and, of course, to a network in which nodes connected by wire and nodes connected by radio exist together.",
                                "Further, the present invention may be used as a telecommunications protocol that allows routers to transmit and receive routing tables on Internet at timings different from each other. A router refers to a relaying apparatus configured to distribute each of various information flowing on a network to a particular destination while a routing table refers to a communication path selection rule referenced at the time of distribution.",
                                "More specifically, in order to realize efficient communication, it is necessary to update a routing table in accordance with every instantaneous change on a network or in traffic and so forth. In light of this, a number of routers distributed on a network transmit and receive routing tables with each other at preselected time intervals. However, it is known that despite that each router sends a respective routing table independently of the other routers, transmissions from the routers gradually become synchronous or conflict, as taught in Floyd, S., and Jacobson. V., \u201cThe Synchronization of Periodic Routing Messages\u201d, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 122-136. This document proposes to solve the above problem by providing the processing period of each node with random variability with respect to a communication protocol to be used for the transmission and reception of routine tables and reports effects achievable with such a scheme. However, the scheme disclosed in the above document is basically dependent only on randomness and cannot achieve sufficient effects.",
                                "By contrast, when the present invention is applied to the circumference stated above, it allows neighboring routers to autonomously control time slots for transmitting respective routing tables and therefore causes transmissions from the neighboring routers to occur at different timings from each other. In this sense, the present invention is advantageous over the scheme disclosed in the document stated above.",
                                "As stated above, the present invention is a drastic solution to the problems of the conflict or the tuning of data transmitted on any kind of wired or wireless network and can be used as a communication protocol for implementing efficient data communication having both of adaptability and stability.",
                                "While in the illustrative embodiments the specific angular frequency parameter \u03c9i is assumed to be the same throughout the system, such a condition is not essential to the present invention, i.e., a particular parameter \u03c9i can be assigned to each node without effecting the operation shown and described. For example, the illustrative embodiments are operable even if the values \u03c9i assigned to nodes are slightly scattered around a reference value in accordance with Gaussian distribution or similar probability distribution.",
                                "The present invention is characterized by control over the acquisition of communication timing information, which is a phase signal in the illustrative embodiments, and is not restricted in the usage of the timing information for communication at all. For example, when each node transmits a data signal with a respective frequency, communication may be held without setting time slots, in which case, too, the start of data communication should only be determined in accordance with the communication timing information.",
                                "While in the illustrative embodiments the conflict ratio \u0394\u03b8ci(t) is reflected by the phase ci (T) as a stress response function value and as the switching of the characteristic of the phase response function \u0394\u03b8ij(t), it may be reflected only as the switching of the characteristic of the phase response function \u0394\u03b8ij(t).",
