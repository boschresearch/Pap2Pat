### Summary of the Results

### Example 1: Sequence Variations in HCMV UL40-Encoded Peptides Control the Activation of Adaptive NKG2C+ NK Cells

### Example 2: Co-Stimulatory Signals are Required to Elicit Polyfunctionality of Adaptive NKG2C+NK Cells Upon Engagement with Sub-Optimal Peptides

### Example 3: Adaptive NKG2C+NK Cells Differentially Recognize HCMV-Encoded Peptides During Infection

### Example 4: Peptide Recognition Controls Relative Accumulation of NKG2C+NK Cells from HCMVâˆ’ Individuals in the Presence of Pro-Inflammatory Signals

### Example 5: Peptide Recognition and Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Co-Operate in Guiding the Differentiation of Adaptive NKG2C+ NK Cells

### Discussion of Examples 1-5
