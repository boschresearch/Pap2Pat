                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate immune cells, which contribute to early immune responses against viral infections (1). Their role in host protection is highlighted by patients with primary NK-cell deficiencies, who suffer from severe and disseminated viral infections caused by herpesviruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (2); and further supported by studies of the murine CMV (MCMV) infection model (3). HCMV has a high prevalence in the adult human population and establishes livelong latency in healthy individuals. The host innate and adaptive immune systems jointly play a crucial role in restraining viral replication and preventing disease but do not eliminate the virus, which in turn engages in a dynamic interaction with the host, resulting in drastically imprinted immune-cell repertoires (4).",
                        "In accordance with these findings, Ly49H+ NK cells from C57BL/6 mice were shown to undergo expansion and adaptation in response to MCMV (3). Similarly, HCMV-seropositivity is associated with a skewed repertoire of human NK cells, and expression of the activating receptor CD94/NKG2C (NKG2C) marks a well characterized NK-cell subset adapted to HCMV infection, consequently termed \u2018adaptive NK cells\u2019 (5, 6, 7). Apart from NKG2C expression, adaptive NKG2C+NK cells can be characterized by altered receptor profiles and remodeled epigenetic landscapes compared to conventional NK cells (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). In contrast to the murine infection model, in which the MCMV protein m157 was established as the ligand for Ly49H (12, 13), a HCMV ligand driving the specific expansion and differentiation of human NKG2C+NK cells has not been identified.",
                        "The non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E serves as cognate ligand for NKG2C as well as its inhibitory counterpart CD94/NKG2A (NKG2A) (14, 15, 16) and has been reported to elicit effector functions in adaptive NKG2C+NK cells (6) as well as to contribute to their expansion in vitro (17, 18). Cell surface stabilization of HLA-E requires loading with peptides, which can be derived from the signal sequences of MHC class I molecules (19) or other proteins such as HSP60 (20) at steady state. In addition to host peptides, the UL40 gene of HCMV was found to encode HLA-E-stabilizing peptides, which partially mimic MHC class I signal sequences (21, 22, 23, 24). Despite HCMV-mediated down-regulation of HLA class I to evade recognition by CD8+ T cells, UL40-derived peptides permit maintenance of HLA-E surface expression on infected cells and thereby preserve inhibition of NK-cell activation via engagement of NKG2A. Indeed, it was demonstrated that co-transfection of UL40 and HLA-E confers protection against NKG2A+NK-cell lines and infection of fibroblasts with UL40-competent HCMV inhibits cytotoxic activity of NKG2A+NK cells (21, 22, 23, 24).",
                        "However, whether NKG2C can recognize UL40 peptides during HCMV infection and result in activation of NKG2C+NK cells remains completely unclear. HLA-E-stabilizing nonameric peptides derived from both MHC class I or UL40 share conserved residues at amino acids 2 and 9, while mutations at positions 5 and 8 have been shown to alter binding of HLA-E/peptide complexes to CD94 heterodimers with NKG2A or NKG2C in structural and biochemical analyses (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30). Conversely, analysis of peptide impacting on functional recognition of HLA-E-expressing cells by NKG2A and NKG2C has been confined to NK-cell clones (28, 29, 30). It was shown that CD94/NKG2C can be activated on an experimental cell line (Jurkat-NKG2C+ reporter cells) by HLA-E displaying cells that were pre-incubated with peptides VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) or VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) (Pupuleku A et al: \u201cElusive Role of the CD94/NKG2C NK Cell Receptor in the Response to Cytomegalovirus: Novel Experimental Observations in a Reporter Cell System\u201d, FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY, vol. 8, 24 Oct. 2017, (30)). These results demonstrate the general peptide-dependency of the interaction of CD94/NKG2 receptors with HLA-E. However, these articles provide no information about NKG2C receptor specificity towards peptides with single amino acid differences and effects of the peptides on, for example, NKG2A activation. They also do not assess the functional consequences of this peptide specificity in terms of cytokine production and most importantly the differential induction of proliferation and specific expansion of NKG2C+NK cells by the different peptides. Furthermore, a medical application of the material and in particular the peptides is not described and no conclusions about their potential use can be based on the data of this article. The article completely focuses on experimentally determining activation of NKG2C in an artificial reporter system.",
                        "To which extent peptide recognition can impact on NK cell-mediated immune responses and whether distinct peptides can drive differential activation, expansion, differentiation, and heterogeneity of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells during HCMV infection remain outstanding questions.",
                        "Infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is widespread in the general population, with the age-adjusted prevalence in Germany being around 30%. HCMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, especially patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which are at large risk for reactivating the virus with potentially lethal consequences. Importantly, the immune system of these patients is concomitantly challenged by HCMV and relapsing leukemia. Therefore, a strategy aimed at controlling both viral infection and leukemia relapse would be of great use.",
                        "Moreover, HCMV congenital infection is associated with microcephaly, mental disabilities and hearing problems. About 1 in 100 to 500 babies is born with congenital HCMV, and of the 10-20% symptomatic infections 30% are lethal, making this a large scale global health problem. Accordingly, large efforts have been invested into developing a vaccine against HCMV, but so far none of these approaches has been of success.",
                        "While large scale efforts in prevention and significant improvements in treatment strategies are bearing fruit in the last years by reducing both cancer incidence and mortality rates, especially advanced tumors still remain a challenge in modern medicine. Increasing lifespans in industrialized and developing countries mean that absolute incidence and mortality numbers are on the rise, which opens opportunities for developing more specific therapeutic approaches to treat subtypes of cancer. One particularly successful concept, which quite recently has found its way into the clinics with impressive results is cancer immunotherapy, with checkpoint inhibition being named the breakthrough of the year 2013. However, a great share of patients remains unresponsive to checkpoint inhibition for various reasons, and the widespread occurrence of autoimmunity further limits its use. One way to circumvent this is to target more specific tumor-associated ligands, as done by the recently FDA-approved CAR T cell therapy for B cell leukemia. In sum, the identification of new and more specific cancer immunotherapy targets bears great potential to develop new and improve current treatment regimens.",
                        "The use of HSP60-derived, HLA-E-binding nonameric peptides for the treatment of tumors has been described in WO 03/011895 A2. The invention described therein relates to modulation of CD94/NKG2 receptor function by HLA-E-bound peptides, which involves parallel modulation of activation NKG2A and NKG2C. However, as also disclosed in the context of the present invention, modifications of single amino acids of a HLA-E-binding peptide can have a tremendous impact on the activation of NK-cell receptors such as NKG2A and NKG2C, so that effects of a specific peptide cannot be extrapolated to apparently similar peptides that differ in one or more amino acids from the peptides of WO 03/011895 A2.",
                        "The innate lymphocytes Natural killer (NK) cells expressing the activating receptor CD94/NKG2C display adaptive features and are stably expanded in a group of individuals who have been infected with HCMV (41). It has been proposed that these cells have beneficial effects against HCMV reactivation (46). Importantly, correlation of reduced relapse rates in patients reactivating HCMV and presenting with NKG2C+NK cell expansions has been reported, pointing towards an anti-leukemic effect of these cells highlighting their potential as an anti-cancer treatment (Cichocki et al. Leukemia. 2016; 30(2):456-63). However, an ex vivo expansion method for such protective CD56dim CD57+ NKG2C+NK cells has not been described by Cichocki et al. and it is to be noted that ex vivo manipulation and expansion of NKG2C+NK cells isolated form a donor probably has an impact on the overall character of the cells, such a modification of the epigenetic landscape, gene and surface marker expression, morphology and/or other characteristics, so that ex vivo expanded NKG2C+NK cells most likely differ significantly from naturally occurring circulating NKG2C+NK cells.",
                        "However, the means by which NKG2C+NK cells can be expanded and activated by HCMV or cancer cells remain unclear, thus limiting their potential therapeutic use. WO2014037422A1 describes the ex vivo expansion of NKG2C+NK cells for adoptive transfer. However, this approach raises severe concerns with respect to safe use of the cells, standardization of treatment and logistics. Besides this method bearing these significant disadvantages, there are no means known in the art to induce expansion and activation of NKG2C+ cells, in particular not for in vivo expansion and activation.",
                        "In light of the prior art, there remains a significant need to provide means for harnessing the therapeutic use of NKG2C+ cells in the treatment of HCMV infection and/or treatment of cancer."

                        "The present invention is based on the entirely surprising finding that peptides of the present invention specifically induce the activation and expansion of NKG2C+NK cells. In particular, presentation of the peptides of the present invention or fragments thereof on a non-classical MHC class I molecule, such as preferably HLA-E, leads to the activation of NKG2C+NK cells resulting in expansion and/or activation of various effector functions such as induction of cell death of the cell presenting the peptide of the present invention on the non-classical MHC class I molecule, preferably HLA-E, and secretion and/or expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL3 and/or CD107a. This was very surprising, since it had been reported that presentation of such peptides on HLA-E mainly display universal inhibitory effects on NK cells based on their binding to the inhibitory receptor NKG2A. Contrastingly, some of these peptides could induce preferential activation of NKG2C+NK cells.",
                        "Furthermore, as disclosed herein, it was found out that the peptides of the invention have a specific activating effect on the subset of NKG2C+NK cells, but not for example on NKG2C\u2212 NK cells. Additionally, the activating effect of the peptides of the invention was receptor specific, since blockage of the NKG2C/CD94 heterodimers almost completely inhibited the activating effect of the peptides of the present invention. Accordingly, the peptides of the invention can be applied in the context of the treatment of diseases associated with pathogenic cells expressing HLA-E and a peptide of the present invention.",
                        "Furthermore, it was entirely unforeseen that, even though the HLA-E binding peptides of the present invention do not differ from other peptides by their binding efficiency to HLA-E, the activation of NKG2C is peptide sequence specific. Indeed, other peptides, which bind to and stabilize HLA-E with equal efficiency as peptides of the present invention, lead to reduced or no selective activation of NKG2C+NK cells. As shown in the example disclosed herein, single amino acid exchanges within peptides presented on HLA-E can be differentially recognized by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells, resulting in differential activation of the cells. This finding was very surprising because, in contrast, NKG2A inhibition is less dependent on peptide sequence recognition and NKG2A+NK cells are equally inhibited by recognition of HLA-E complexed with the peptides according to SEQ ID NO 1.",
                        "It was completely unexpected that the complexes formed by HLA-E and the peptides of the present invention engage differentially with CD94/NKG2C and lead to specific activation of this receptor complex on NK cells, whereas other receptors or receptor complexes that can interact with HLA-E, such as NKG2A, do not differentiate between specific peptide/HLA-E complexes. Accordingly, the present invention unexpectedly enables efficient, specific and selective activation of NKG2C+NK cells. Surprisingly, the peptides of the present invention are comprised by the UL-40 protein of different HCMV strains as well as MHC Class I molecules, in particular the signal sequence of HLA-G. HLA-G is a non-classical MHC class I molecule absent in most healthy tissues and is mainly expressed during pregnancy and in certain cancer cells and is upregulated during inflammatory processes. Accordingly, the peptide of the present invention can be used in the context of treating diseases, which are associated with pathogenic cells, which express HLA-E and peptides comprising an amino acid sequence of a peptide of the present invention, for example cells expressing HLA-G or UL-40 of HCMV.",
                        "In preferred embodiments, the peptide of the invention consists of an amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID NO 2 (VMAPRTLFL).

                        "This aspect of the invention is based on the surprising finding that cells presenting the complex formed by HLA-E and the peptide of the present invention on their surface are recognized by NKG2C+NK cells through engagement of the complex with the CD94/NKG2C heterodimer. This leads to activation of the NKG2C+NK cells resulting in secretion of several effector proteins and induction of cytotoxicity towards the cells presenting the complex. Such cells are in most cases pathogenic cells, such as tumor/cancer cells expressing HLA-G, comprising a peptide of the present invention in its leader/signal sequence, and HLA-E, or HCMV infected cells comprising actively replicating HCMV expressing UL-40. The pathogenic cells can be more efficiently fought by the immune system after recognition by NKG2C+NK cells. Accordingly, provision of an increased number of NKG2C+NK cells is beneficial for the treatment of disease associated with pathogenic cells expressing peptides comprising the amino acid sequence of a peptide of the present invention an HLA-E. Such an increased number of NKG2C+NK cells can be provided or achieved by administration of the peptide of the present invention leading to in vivo expansion of the NKG2C+NK cells, or administration of NKG2C+NK cells of the present invention, which have been generated by the in vitro method of the present invention.",

                        "Check point inhibitors have gained a lot of attention in the context of cancer treatment, since it turned out that the inhibition or blockage of inhibitory receptors expressed by immune cells and in particular immune effector cells, such as for example T cells, but also NK cells, enables robust activation of the effector cells to elicit an effective immune response against for example cancer cells. This is due to the fact that in many pathological conditions, especially cancer and viral infections, the pathogenic cells prevent an effective immune response by activating inhibitory receptors on immune cells, thereby preventing an effector response of the immune system against the pathogenic cells. However, check point inhibitors make it possible to overcome this pathological mechanism by preventing activation of the inhibitory receptors and therefore enabling and potentiating the activation of an effective immune response against the pathogenic cells.",

It can be advantageous to use the peptides of the present invention in combination with an activator or stimulator of CD2, which can act as a co-stimulatory receptor on NK cells and particularly on NKG2C+NK cells, since surprisingly the combined activation leads to an enhanced poly-functional response of the NKG2C+NK cells including activation of cytotoxic activity as well as secretion of inflammatory mediators such as CCL3, CD107a, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, which cannot be explained by the addition of the individual effects of the peptides and the CD2-activators, but instead argue for the presence of a synergistic effect. Accordingly, the engagement of the co-stimulatory receptor CD2 can lower the activation threshold of NKG2C+NK cells by the peptides of the present invention and therefore enable the peptides of the present invention to optimally trigger multiple effector functions in adaptive NKG2C+NK cells.",

NK cells provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. Typically, immune cells detect major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release, causing lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named \u201cnatural killers\u201d because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \u201cself\u201d markers of MHC class 1.

These receptors stimulate or inhibit cytotoxic activity of NK cells, therefore they are divided into activating and inhibitory receptors according to their function. CD94/NKG2 recognize non-classical MHC glycoproteins class I. CD94/NKG2 family includes seven members: NKG2A, B, C, D, E, F and H. NKG2 receptors are transmembrane proteins type II which dimerize with CD94 molecule. CD94 contains a short cytoplasmic domain and it is responsible for signal transduction. Therefore NKG2 receptors form disulfide bonded heterodimers with CD94. NKG2D represent an exception, since it predominantly forms a homodimer.",

As a result, NK cell activation is suppressed.",

NKG2D is activating receptor as well but it couples with adaptor protein DAP10 and triggers actin reorganization (cell polarization) and degranulation upon ligand engagement. The function of NKG2F receptor is not clear.",

Non-classical MHC glycoproteins class I are structurally similar to classical MHC class I molecules, but they present mainly peptides derived from the signal peptides of MHC class I. Therefore NK cells can indirectly monitor the expression of classical MHC class I molecules through the interaction of CD94/NKG2 with HLA-E.",
                        "Non-classical MHC class I molecules comprise HLA-G, HLA-E and HLE-F. For HLA-G, 7 protein isoforms have been described. Four of these isoforms are membrane-bound (HLA-G 1-4) while 3 of them lack exons 5-7, hence and existing as secreted forms (HLA-G 5-7). Of all membrane-bound HLA-G variants, HLA-G1 represents the sole full-length version of the molecule. Conversely, HLA-G2 does not contain exon 3, HLA-G3 is missing exons 3 and 4, and HLA-G4 does not include exon 4. The soluble isoforms of HLA-G (namely, HLA-G5, HLA-G6, and HLA-G7) contain part of intron 4, harboring a stop codon. This results in the expression of truncated proteins lacking exon 5, which encodes the transmembrane domain. HLA-G5, -G6, and -G7 represent the soluble counterparts of HLA-G1, G2, and-G3, respectively. HLA-E consists of 8 exons, wherein the first encodes the leader peptide sequence, exons 2, 3 and 4 encode the MHC immunoglobulin-like a domains 1, 2, and 3, respectively, exon 5 encodes the transmembrane domain and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail. Similar to HLA-G, HLA-E forms a complex with \u03b22 microglobulin. HLA-E consists of 8 exons. Of these, the first encodes the leader peptide sequence, exons 2, 3 and 4 encode the MHC immunoglobulin-like a domains 1, 2, and 3, respectively, exon 5 encodes the transmembrane domain and exons 6 and 7 encode the cytoplasmic tail. Similar to HLA-G, HLA-E forms a complex with \u03b22 microglobulin.",
                        "HLA-G, -E, and -F are important regulators of the immune system and the upregulation of HLA-G, -E, and -F following IFN\u03b3 stimulation suggests that non-classical MHC class I molecules may be involved in negative feedback responses to potentially harmful pro-inflammatory responses. While inflammatory responses are required to eliminate cancer cells, they also trigger strong immuno-regulatory mechanisms that limit the recognition of malignant cells by the immune system, hence favoring tumor progression. Non-classical MHC class I molecules constitute means whereby malignant cells escape immuno-surveillance. Indeed, these molecules inhibit the activity of the immune system by binding to inhibitory receptors expressed by effector cells, hence suppressing their functions or inducing their apoptotic demise (Kochan et al. Oncoimmunology. 2013 Nov. 1; 2(11): e26491; Smyth et al. Oncoimmunology. 2013 Mar. 1; 2(3): e23336). HLA-E has a very specialized role in cell recognition by NK cells by binding a restricted subset of peptides derived from signal peptides of classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules, such as HLA-A, B, C, G. These peptides are released from the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the signal peptide peptidase, trimmed by the cytosolic proteasome, transport into the ER lumen by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and subsequently bound to the groove on the HLA-E molecule. This allows HLA-E to assemble correctly and to be stabilized, leading to expression on the cell surface. NK cells recognize the complex formed by HLA-E+peptide using the heterodimeric inhibitory receptors CD94/NKG2A, B and/or C. When CD94/NKG2A or CD94/NKG2B is engaged, it produces an inhibitory effect on the cytotoxic activity of the NK cell to prevent cell lysis, whereas binding of HLA-E to CD94/NKG2C results in NK cell activation. This interaction has been shown to trigger expansion of NK cell subsets in antiviral responses.",
                        "HLA-G may play a role in immune tolerance in pregnancy, being expressed in the placenta by extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT), while the classical MHC class I genes (HLA-A and HLA-B) are not expressed. HLA-G is a ligand for NK cell inhibitory receptor KIR2DL4, and therefore expression of this HLA by the trophoblast defends it against NK cell-mediated death. Aberrant induction of HLA-G expression has been observed in various malignancies and strongly associated with tumor immune escape, metastasis and poor prognosis. HLA-G, membrane-bound or soluble, strongly binds its inhibitory receptors on immune cells (NK, T, B, monocytes/dendritic cells), inhibits the functions of these effectors, and so induces immune inhibition. HLA-G function may therefore be beneficial and protective when expressed by a fetus or a transplant, but deleterious when expressed by a tumor or cancer cells, because it also protects malignant cells from antitumor immunity. Accordingly, HLA-G can be classified as an checkpoint molecule.",

It is typically abbreviated as HCMV or, commonly but more ambiguously, as CMV. It is also known as human herpesvirus-5 (HHV-5). HCMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the immune-compromised, such as HIV-infected persons, organ transplant recipients, or newborn infants. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can lead to significant morbidity and even death. After infection, HCMV remains latent within the body throughout life and can be reactivated at any time.

Human CMV has evolved multiple strategies to interfere with immune recognition of the host. A variety of mechanisms target Ag presentation by MHC class I molecules resulting in a reduced class I cell-surface expression. This down-regulation of class I molecules can trigger NK cytotoxicity, which would have to be counteracted by the virus to establish long-term infection. The UL-40 protein of HCMV, which is encoded by the open reading frame UL-40, encodes a canonical ligand for HLA-E, and expression of UL-40 in HLA-E-positive target cells is thought to induce resistance to NK cell lysis via the CD94/NKG2A receptor. However, as disclosed herein, UL-40 can comprise the peptides of the present invention and therefore HCMV infected cells may express the complex of HLA-E and the peptide of the present invention on their surface.

In general, an adjuvant is an agent that is given in addition to the primary or initial therapy to maximize its effectiveness. In the context of the present invention, the adjuvant is to be understood as an immunologic adjuvant. Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a compound that modifies the immune system, such as the peptide of the present invention or a vaccine. In embodiments, the peptide of the invention may be regarded as a peptide vaccine. An immunological adjuvant stimulates the immune system to respond more vigorously to an immunological treatment. As a consequence, the combined treatment with an adjuvant provides increased immunity to a particular disease. It is believed that adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called PAMPs, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), molecular cages for antigen, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific antigenic moieties, the presence of an adjuvant can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells (DCs), lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection. Furthermore, the use of such adjuvants that are mimicking PAMPs leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

Cytokines are currently being clinically used as biological response modifiers for the treatment of various disorders. The term cytokine is a general term used to describe a large group of proteins. Particular kinds of cytokines may include Monokines, namely cytokines produced by mononuclear phagocytic cells, Lymphokines, namely cytokines produced by activated lymphocytes, especially Th cells, Interleukins, namely cytokines that act as mediators between leukocytes and Chemokines, namely small cytokines primarily responsible for leucocyte migration. Cytokine signaling is flexible and can induce both protective and damaging responses. They can produce cascades, or enhance or suppress production of other cytokines. Despite the various roles of cytokines, a skilled person is aware of which cytokines may be considered as immune response stimulating and therefore applied in the treatment of a tumor disease as described herein. Cytokines have the ability to modulate immune responses and are often utilized by a tumor to allow it to grow and manipulate the immune response. These immune-modulating effects allow them to be used as drugs to provoke an immune response against the tumor. Chemokines refer to a sub-group of cytokines (signaling proteins) secreted by cells. Chemokines have the ability to induce directed chemotaxis in nearby responsive cells; they are chemotactic cytokines.

For reinsertion of viral genes US2-US6 deleted in TB40 BAC4, two-step replacement mutagenesis based on homologous recombination in E. coli64 was performed utilizing the shuttle plasmid pUH1565. The resulting BAC TB40R was further modified by addition of the Cre gene and loxP sites flanking the BAC vector sequences to allow self-excision upon introduction into HCMV-permissive cells. A gpt gene in BAC TB40R was replaced with a tetracycline resistance marker by en passant mutagenesis in E. coli strain GS178366 and utilizing a PCR fragment amplified with primers US2-lox-tet.for (see Table 6 for primer sequences using during mutagenesis) and G-lox-tet.rev and template plasmid pori6K-Tet (M. Messerle, unpublished). The PCR product was recombined with TB40R, giving rise to TB40R-lox-Tet, into which the Cre recombinase sequences were inserted. To this end, a template plasmid was generated containing sequences for a polyomavirus promoter, an intron-containing Cre gene with internal insertion of a kanamycin-resistance marker (kanR) and a loxP site. The kanR marker (with an adjacent I-Scel restriction site) was amplified with primers pIC1.for and MC-Cre.rev with plasmid pori6K-RIT (M. Messerle unpublished) as template, and the PCR fragment for the Cre gene was amplified with primers kanR-ISce.for and pIC.rev and template plasmid pMC-Cre-Intron (E. M. Borst, unpublished; pMC-Cre-Intron contains the Cre gene of plasmid pGS40367, the latter kindly provided by G. Smith, Northwestern University). The resulting PCR products were added to vector pIC168 next to a loxP site by Gibson assembly69 using the Gibson Assembly Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEB). Integrity of the plasmid pIC-kanR-Cre-Intron was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. A PCR fragment was produced from pIC-kanR-Cre-Intron with primer pair loxPUS2.for and KanRITyellow.rev, and recombined with TB40R-lox-Tet, followed by seamless excision of the kanR cassette as described66. The final HCMV BAC, TB40R-Cre, served for mutagenesis of the UL40 sequences. To mutate the UL40 region, the following primer pairs were used with pori6K-RIT as template: UL40_VMAPRTLIL.for and UL40_VMAPRTLIL.rev, UL40_VMAPRTLFL.for and UL40_VMAPRTLFL.rev, and UL40_VMAPQSLLL.for and UL40_VMAPQSLLL.rev. En passant mutagenesis using the resulting PCR products and BAC TB40R-Cre, followed by excision of the kanR marker as reported66, gave rise to recombinant HCMV BAC genomes containing UL40 genes encoding for VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2), VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3), or VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 4) peptides, respectively. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing of the relevant parts within the BAC genomes. Virus mutants were reconstituted by transfection of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF; Merck Millipore; cultured as outlined elsewhere64) by adenofection as described70. Virus stock was produced by seeding 1\u00d7107 HFF into four T75 flasks, followed by infection the next day in serum-free medium at a multiplicity of infection of 1, followed by centrifugal enhancement at 950 g for 30 min.

From Equation (1), we may compute the total cell number at each time point as C(t)=\u03a3i=0\u221eNi(t). Equation (1) is a variant of the well-established Gett/Hodgkin model38, for which a convenient analytical formulation was described71. That analytical description considers the dynamics of dividing cells after their first division (generations N1, N2, . . . ). Since the cell number data in our study show substantial initial cell death before the onset of clonal expansion, we additionally consider generation N0. That generation consists of dividing cells that have not yet divided (first term), and non-dividing cells, which we take as decaying with the same death rate as dividing cells (second term). To be consistent with our observation that almost all cells present at day 7 have divided at least once across conditions (FIG. 7 and FIG. 10a), in Equation (1), we set the fraction of non-dividing cells to \u03c7=0.05/e\u2212kttp=6 days. Thus, in the model, the non-dividing cells have dropped to 5% of their initial population on the 6th day after stimulation. For precursor frequencies, we have experimental measurements at days 1 through 7 from the CellTrace data analysis (FIG. 7e and FIG. 10a).

Here, \u0393(x) is the Euler gamma function, and we determined the parameters \u03b1,\u03b2 by nonlinear optimization. Thus, the only free parameters were division time tdiv and death rate kd. These values were obtained by non-linear optimization with respect to experimentally measured cell numbers. For all curve fitting procedures, the function fitnlm in Matlab, (Mathworks, version R2017b) was used. Specifically, the distribution \u03c6(t) of first division times from the measured precursor frequencies, and the division time tdiv as well as death rate kd were determined by fitting Equation (1) to kinetic cell number data. In both cases, experimentally obtained kinetic data was averaged across donors and the variability between donors at each time-point was considered by weighting the averaged data by the weights wl=1/\u03c3l2, where \u03c3l is the standard deviation across donors at the l-th measurement time-point.",

In some individuals infected by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), an NK-cell subset expressing the activating receptor NKG2C undergoes clonal-like expansion, partially resembling anti-viral adaptive responses. However, the viral ligand driving the activation and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells differentially recognize distinct HCMV strains encoding variable UL40 peptides, which\u2014in combination with pro-inflammatory signals\u2014control the expansion and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells.

However, both the percentage of NKG2C+NK cells and their CD2+ Siglec-7-NKG2A\u2212Fc\u03b5R1\u03b3\u2212 adaptive phenotype are prominently heterogeneous, as indicated by the respective coefficients of variation (CV) (FIG. 1a, b). This heterogeneity suggests the involvement of variable host or HCMV factors in driving the expansion and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells among different individuals. In quest of virus factors driving this phenomenon, we performed an integrated analysis of 217 clinical isolates obtained by combining sequencing of viral UL40 DNA with a meta-analysis of reported HCMV isolates. The analysis corroborated considerable heterogeneity within the UL40-encoded peptide repertoire (30, 31) and the sequences VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3), VMAPRTLLL (SEQ ID NO. 4), and VMAPRTLVL (SEQ ID NO. 5), were most commonly represented (FIG. 2a, b), while 31.2% of the strains encoded alternative and not yet described HCMV UL40 sequences, such as VMAPRTLLM (SEQ ID NO. 27), VMGPRTLLL (SEQ ID NO. 35), VMAPWTLLL (SEQ ID NO. 17), or VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) (FIG. 2a, Table 2). We next asked whether high sequence variability within the HCMV UL40 region could impact on the capacity to stabilize HLA-E and to activate NKG2C+NK cells. To address this question, murine TAP-deficient RMA-S cells transfected with human \u03b22-microglobulin and HLA-E (RMA-S/HLA-E) were pulsed with a selection of peptides from the sequence analysis, namely VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3), VMAPRTLVL (SEQ ID NO. 5), VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2, and VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12), the latter serving as control due to its poor interaction with NKG2 receptors (30). Stimulation of purified NK cells with peptide-pulsed RMA-S/HLA-E revealed that VMAPRTLVL (SEQ ID NO. 5), VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3), and VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) differentially triggered TNF, IFN-\u03b3, CD107a, and CCL3 expression by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells from healthy HCMV+ individuals, while no activation was detected when using VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12)-pulsed targets. Notably, a gradient in the ability of peptides to induce NKG2C+NK-cell effector functions could be consistently observed (VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)>VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3)>VMAPRTLVL) (SEQ ID NO. 5) (FIG. 2c, d). Differential activation was also detected in cytotoxicity assays (FIG. 1d). Importantly, the ability of peptides to activate NKG2C+NK cells with different efficiency did not depend on their intrinsic ability to bind HLA-E: with the exception of VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12), the analyzed UL40-encoded peptides equally stabilized HLA-E at saturating concentrations (FIG. 1e), which is in line with comparable binding affinities predicted by the NetMHC 4.0 algorithm32 (FIG. 1f). Moreover, pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the decay in surface HLA-E of VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3)- and VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)-pulsed cells followed identical kinetics (FIG. 1g). Along this line, elevated activation of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells by VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) was consistent upon pulsing with sub-optimal peptide concentrations, at which VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) was more efficiently stabilizing HLA-E (FIG. 2e; FIG. 1h). Further corroborating specific receptor-mediated recognition, activation was restricted to NKG2C+NK cells and entirely inhibited in the presence of an anti-CD94 blocking antibody (FIG. 1i, j). Since both NKG2A and NKG2C can recognize HLA-E/peptide complexes, we co-cultured purified NK cells with K562 cells transfected with HLA-E (K562/HLA-E) pulsed with varying peptide concentrations. As opposed to murine RMA-S, human K562 represent susceptible targets for all human NK cells, rendering this experimental platform optimally tailored for side by side analysis of adaptive NKG2C+ cell activation and conventional NKG2C\u2212 NKG2A+ cell inhibition. In contrast to adaptive NKG2C+NK-cell activation, NKG2A+ NKG2C\u2212 NK cells did not preferentially respond to VMAPRTLFL(SEQ ID NO. 2)-pulsed targets (FIG. 1k), suggesting different functional abilities of NKG2C and NKG2A upon interaction with HLA-E/peptide complexes. Together, these data demonstrate that HCMV isolates encode for a broad range of HLA-E-stabilizing peptides and that recognition of distinct HLA-E/peptide complexes controls the activation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells."

Stimulation with peptide-pulsed K562/HLA-E, which express a broad range of ligands for NK-cell receptors, resulted in overall amplified NKG2C+ cell activation, while the hierarchy among peptides was maintained (FIG. 3a). Since effector functions were strongly decreased by blocking the LFA-3-CD2 axis (11) (FIG. 3b, c), we next examined whether peptides recognized with low or intermediate functional avidity could preferentially benefit from CD2 co-stimulation by using RMA-S/HLA-E transfected with human LFA-3. While stimulation with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)-pulsed RMA-S/HLA-E was sufficient to induce consistent co-expression of multiple effector functions (CCL3+ CD107a+ IFN-\u03b3+ TNF+) even in the absence of co-stimulation, engagement of CD2 was required to elicit polyfunctional responses upon stimulation with the VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) variant (FIG. 4a-d). These findings highlight that recognition of the VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptide is sufficient to induce maximal functionality of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells, but that engagement of the co-stimulatory receptor CD2 can lower the activation threshold, enabling peptides such as VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) to optimally trigger multiple effector functions in adaptive NKG2C+NK cells."

                                "To ascertain whether distinct UL40-encoded peptides could be differentially recognized by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells during infection, we re-inserted the immunomodulatory US2-6 genes into the TB40 BAC4 and genetically modified the UL40 locus of the resulting repaired TB40 (TB40R) HCMV strain to encode either VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12), VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3), or VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptides (FIG. 5a). Upon infection of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), UL40 transcripts were abundantly present as early as 16 hours post infection (FIG. 6a) and the genetically modified viruses were equally efficient in infecting HUVEC (FIG. 5b, c) as well as in modulating HLA class I levels (FIG. 6b). In line with previous reports, HCMV infection of HUVEC did not result in HLA-E up-regulation (33) (FIG. 6c). Importantly, adaptive NKG2C+NK cells displayed significantly elevated TNF, IFN-\u03b3, CD107 and CCL3 expression in response to HUVEC infected with TB40RUL40_VMAPRTLFL compared to the other strains, while TB40RUL40_VMAPRTLIL elicited slightly increased activation of selected effector functions (FIG. 6d). Differential activation by HUVEC infected with distinct HCMV strains was further enhanced by IFN-\u03b3 treatment, which can prime anti-viral NK-cell functions (34) (FIG. 5d, e). In contrast, NKG2C\u2212 NK cells were not affected by virus variants even after IFN-\u03b1 priming (FIG. 6e). These findings suggest that single amino acid exchanges within the UL40 protein can be differentially recognized by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells during infection and imply that selected mutations in UL40 modulate adaptive NKG2C+NK-cell responses."

                                "To examine whether peptide recognition not only affects the differential activation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells from HCMV+ individuals, but could also influence the extent of NKG2C+NK-cell proliferation from HCMV\u2212 individuals, purified CD56dim NK cells from HCMV\u2212 donors were co-cultured with peptide-pulsed target cells in the presence of IL-15. In the absence of co-stimulation, only the VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptide significantly induced preferential cell division of NKG2C+NK cells (FIG. 7a-b). However, co-engagement of CD2 synergized with peptide recognition and enabled both the VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) and the VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptides to drive consistently higher proliferation of NKG2C+NK cells compared to VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12) (FIG. 8a-c, FIG. 7c). Elevated cell division was reflected in increased absolute counts, although not in frequency, of NKG2C+NK cells after 7 and 14 days of culture (FIG. 8d-e, FIG. 7d-e). In vivo, CMV generates a systemic inflammatory milieu (35), which is required for the generation of MCMV-specific adaptive Ly49H+ mouse NK cells (36). Integration of pro-inflammatory signals by short-term addition of IL-12 and IL-18 (IL-12/18) to VMAPRTLVL (SEQ ID NO. 5)-, VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3)-, or VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)-pulsed targets resulted in an increase of NKG2C+NK-cell absolute counts as well as frequencies compared to the non-activating VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12) peptide (FIG. 9a-c), indicating a permissive role for pro-inflammatory cytokine signals in the accumulation of NKG2C+ cells in a peptide-dependent fashion. In the early culture period, presence of IL-12/18 lead to progressive NK-cell loss independent of peptide recognition, while at later time points, engagement of NKG2C by VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) rescued cell numbers, resulting in increasing frequencies of NKG2C+NK cells (FIG. 9d, e, FIG. 10a). In order to gain a quantitative understanding of NKG2C+NK-cell proliferation and accumulation dynamics in this setting, we modified the Gett-Hodgkin model (37) to explicitly take cell division and cell death as well as non-dividing, dying cells into account. Using experimentally determined precursor frequencies (FIG. 10b, c), division times as well as death rates as fitting parameters, the model could describe the data experimentally obtained in the first week of culture, both in the presence (FIG. 9f) and absence of IL-12/18 signaling (FIG. 10d). Without taking varying cell division times and death rates into account, experimental differences in precursor frequencies alone could not explain the observed dynamics of NKG2C+ NK cells (FIG. 10e, f). In the absence of IL-12/18, model analysis revealed shortened division times in the presence of VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)\u2014compared to VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12)-pulsed targets, while inferred cell death rates were similar (FIG. 10d). Provision of pro-inflammatory cytokines during the initial phase of culture resulted in dramatically accelerated NKG2C+NK-cell division induced by VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2), while death rates were higher in the presence of VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12) compared to VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) (FIG. 9f). Thus, mathematical model analysis suggests that the experimentally observed fast proliferation onset and increased absolute NKG2C+NK-cell numbers in response to VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)-pulsed targets can be largely explained by accelerated cell division; and presence of IL-12/18 results in slightly decreased cell death upon pulsing with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) compared to VMAPQSLLL (SEQ ID NO. 12).",

                                "Bac Remodeled receptor repertoires and epigenetic landscapes are hallmarks of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells in HCMV+ individuals (5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Since peptide recognition was required to enable relative accumulation of NKG2C+NK-cells from HCMV\u2212 individuals in the presence of IL-12/18, we examined the individual and combined contributions of the potent VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptide and of pro-inflammatory cytokines to initiate adaptive NK-cell differentiation. While culture with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) alone only had mild effects, the combination of VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) with IL-12/18 skewed expression of several markers including CD2, Siglec-7, educating KIR, Syk, and CD161 preferentially in NKG2C+ cells (FIG. 11a-b, FIG. 12a). Moreover, short stimulation with IL-12/18 played a predominant role in inducing down-regulation of Fc\u03b5R1\u03b3 and CD7 in both NKG2C+ and NKG2C\u2212 cells (FIG. 12a, b), while other factors might control NKG2A and DNAM-1 dynamics, since their expression was variable after culture (FIG. 12a, b). Notably, levels of DNA methylation of the IFNG conserved non-coding sequence (CNS1), which is hypo-methylated in adaptive NK cells (9, 11), were strikingly reduced after combined treatment with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) and IL-12/18 (FIG. 11c, d). Overall, NKG2C engagement co-operated with pro-inflammatory cytokines in guiding the differentiation of NKG2C+NK cells from HCMV\u2212 individuals. As VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)+IL-12/18 stimulation of NKG2C+NK cells from HCMV\u2212 individuals appeared to most efficiently favor the phenotypic skewing towards adaptive NK cells, we next analyzed the global transcriptional imprinting induced by the combined stimuli. Apart from SIGLEC7, CD7, SYK, and CD2, VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)+IL-12/18 resulted in consistent transcriptional modulation of several other markers associated with adaptive NK cells including NCR3 (NKp30), SH2DB1 (EAT2) and ZBTB32 (PLZP), while the expression of other adaptive genes such as ZBTB16 (PLZF), ZBTB20, ITGAL or CRTAM was altered only in some individuals (FIG. 11e; FIG. 12c) (5, 7, 38). Functionally, VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)+IL-12/18 promoted sustained up-regulation of activation and exhaustion markers such as HLA-DR, TNFRSF9 (4-1 BB), LAG3, CTLA4, and PDCD1 (PD1) as well as of effector functions including IFNG, TNF, CCL3, CCL4, IL8, CSF2, IL10, GZMB, and TNFSF10 (TRAIL) (FIG. 12d), indicating that the combination of these two stimuli promote broad transcriptional imprinting of phenotypic and effector features typical of adaptive NK cells.",
                                "Finally, to substantiate the data obtained from in vitro systems, we monitored a cohort of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients, which did or did not reactivate HCMV (Table 3). Upon detection of HCMV reactivation, the peptide-encoding UL40 region of the strain causing the acute infection was sequenced. Next, the NK-cell phenotype was comparatively analyzed after resolution of acute infection selectively in patients infected with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)- or VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3)-encoding viruses (FIG. 13a). In line with HCMV causing the expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells (39, 40), percentages of NKG2C-expressing CD56dim NK cells were elevated in patients with HCMV reactivation, although this was not consistently impacted by HCMV strains (FIG. 14a, b) and NKG2C+ NK-cell frequencies were dynamic in time among patients infected with both VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) or VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) HCMV variants (FIG. 13c). Notably, frequencies of NK cells displaying the adaptive phenotype CD2+ Siglec-7-NKG2A\u2212Fc\u03b5R1\u03b3-were elevated in NKG2C+ NK cells derived from patients infected with VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2)-encoding viruses (FIG. 14c, FIG. 13b). Conversely, patients infected with VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) variants displayed varying degrees of adaptive NK-cell differentiation (FIG. 14c, FIG. 13b). Phenotypic alterations were acquired early after HCMV-reactivation within the NKG2C+ compartment and remained relatively stable over time (FIG. 14d), implying that this phenomenon is largely uncoupled from NK-cell maturation after HSCT. Together with the data from in vitro experiments, these findings imply that recognition of distinct UL40-encoded peptides differentially contributes to the accumulation and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells during infection.",
                                "In summary, our data provide evidence for sensitive recognition of HCMV-encoded peptides by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells, which\u2014in co-operation with pro-inflammatory cytokine cues\u2014drives their activation and shapes their population size as well as their phenotypic features in response to HCMV infection. Thus, we propose that the diversity of the NK-cell repertoire among healthy HCMV+ individuals is impacted by the HCMV strain causing the infection."

                                "HCMV-induced adaptive NKG2C+NK cells display several features partially recapitulating aspects of T-cell biology, including clonal-like expansion, reprogramming of their recognition repertoire, and global epigenetic remodeling (41). In this study, we propose that expression of NKG2C marks an additional adaptive feature of innate lymphocytes, equipping NKG2C+NK cells with a germ line-encoded receptor displaying fine peptide specificity and enabling differential recognition of HCMV strains. These findings are even more striking considering our previous identification of CD8+ T cells bearing T-cell receptors (TCR) specific for UL40 peptide/HLA-E complexes, which indicates UL40 as a shared epitope recognized by both NKG2C+NK cells and CD8+ T cells (42). It seems counter-intuitive that HCMV has maintained an activating ligand for NKG2C, despite extensive co-evolution with ist human host. Inversely, UL40-encoded peptides were suggested to serve as an immune evasion strategy by maintaining HLA-E surface expression in the absence of HLA-A/B/C-derived peptides, thus preventing activation of NK cells expressing the cognate inhibitory receptor NKG2A22. Indeed, peptides unable to stabilize HLA-E are rarely encoded by UL40, suggesting that expression of UL40 could be an advantage for the virus. However, our data indicate that the inhibitory function of NKG2A is only subtly tuned by recognition of distinct peptides, unlikely explaining highly polymorphic UL40 sequences. Conversely, UL40 polymorphisms result in NKG2C-mediated responses with different functional avidities: recognition of potent HCMV peptides is sufficient for optimal activation of NKG2C+NK cells, while peptides with lower potency rely more stringently on co-stimulatory signals. Thus, peptides with lower potency might provide a window of opportunity for the virus to suppress activation of NKG2A+ NK cells and simultaneously allow a certain degree of NKG2C+ NK-cell activation on the host side. Therefore, we propose that immune pressure mediated by adaptive NKG2C+NK cells could underlie the heterogeneity of UL40 sequences. This immune pressure potentially explains the relative rareness of the VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptide\u2014displaying potent functional avidity for NKG2C\u2212 and the high frequency of UL40-encoded peptides with low or intermediate avidity towards NKG2C.",
                                "Interestingly, commonly represented HCMV UL40 peptides with low or intermediate avidity toward NKG2C, such as VMAPRTLIL (SEQ ID NO. 3) and VMAPRTLVL (SEQ ID NO. 5), closely resemble self-peptides derived from HLA class I alleles. We envisage that these peptides would not promote expansion and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells at steady state. However, viral mimics with identical sequences might enable activation and differentiation of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells in the presence of pro-inflammatory signaling and HLA class I down-regulation, which concomitantly occur during HCMV infection. Conversely, the rare UL40-derived VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) peptide, which is particularly efficient in driving adaptive NKG2C+NK-cell responses, mimics the signal peptide of HLA-G, the expression of which is restricted to pregnancy and up-regulated in tumors or during inflammation (43). In light of these data, it is conceivable that activation and expansion of adaptive NKG2C+NK cells from HCMV+ individuals observed during heterologous infections (44, 45) could reflect cross-reactivity of NKG2C towards other viral or even self-peptides in the presence of co-stimulation and inflammatory conditions. Structural analyses of CD94/NKG2 heterodimers have indicated that the C-terminus of peptides presented on HLA-E primarily interacts with CD94 (25, 26, 27). Intriguingly, our data imply that engagement of CD94/NKG2A and CD94/NKG2C by HLA-E/peptide complexes results in strikingly differential and peptide-dependent functional consequences. Although NKG2A and NKG2C display high sequence homology, several amino acids distinct between the two proteins are located in close proximity to the interface with CD94 (25, 26). Accordingly, it was suggested that slight differences in the amino acid sequence between NKG2A and NKG2C could alter the conformation or orientation of the CD94/NKG2 heterodimers (25, 26). Such conformational changes could indirectly affect the recognition of the C-terminal sequence of HLA-E-bound peptides by CD94, resulting in distinct interaction strengths and functional avidities by the two heterodimers.",
                                "Despite the pivotal role of NKG2C in activating NK cells during infection and a case report suggesting that NKG2C+NK cells can control HCMV infection in the absence of T cells in vivo (46), individuals deficient for KLRC2 (encoding NKG2C) lack a clinical phenotype (11, 47). These findings imply the presence of compensatory mechanisms and suggest that NKG2C recognition of HLA-E/UL40 peptide complexes does not represent the only HCMV-derived signal driving adaptive responses of specific NK-cell subsets. Indeed, adaptive NKG2C\u2212 NK cells expressing activating KIR have been described in KLRC2-deficient and -sufficient humans (8, 11, 48) and recognition of yet unknown viral ligands by activating KIR or other receptors could result in expansion and differentiation of adaptive cells within the NKG2C\u2212 compartment. Supporting this scenario, it was recently reported that selected HCMV strains can modulate HLA-C on infected cells and thereby induce activation of KIR2DS1+ NK cells (49). Similarly, Ly49H-independent NK-cell control of MCMV has been demonstrated in mouse strains other than C57BL/6 (50, 51), reinforcing the concept that NK-cell subsets expressing distinct receptors provide multiple and partially redundant recognition strategies of CMV-infected cells in both humans and mice. Generation of murine adaptive Ly49H+ NK cells requires cross-linking of Ly49H (12, 13, 52) and is enhanced by DNAM-1 co-stimulation53. Furthermore, IL-12 is essential for the expansion and protective function of virus-specific Ly49H+ NK cells (36). Our data indicate that pro-inflammatory signaling via IL-12/18, which was shown to generate memory-like NK-cell properties independent of CMV infection (54, 55), results in fundamental phenotypic and functional changes and initiates adaptive NK-cell differentiation. However, provision of IL-12/18 is not sufficient to expand NKG2C+ NK cells form HCMV\u2212 individuals and induces sustained activation-induced cell death. When exposed to IL-12/18, the strength of peptide recognition by NKG2C correlated with the numerical and relative expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells, implying that the quality of peptide recognition contributes to configure variable pools of differentiated adaptive NK cells in infected individuals.",
                                "In conclusion, our data reveal an exquisite mechanism of specific innate recognition of HCMV\u2212 infected cells as a novel adaptive property of NKG2C+ NK cells. By recognizing variable UL40-encoded peptides, NKG2C can contribute to dynamic shifts in the NK-cell compartment, favoring the expansion and differentiation of adaptive subsets based on the strength of peptide recognition. On the pathogen side, variability in the UL40 peptide repertoire can be regarded as an adaptation attempt of HCMV to modulate host responses. Together, peptide recognition by NKG2C and sequence variants of UL40-derived peptides further expose the well-adapted host-pathogen interaction between NK cells and HCMV.",

                                "The HCMV peptide VMAPRTLFL is also found in the leader sequence of HLA-G (Llano et al., 1998; European journal of immunology 28, 2854-2863), another non-classical MHC class I molecule which is not expressed in most healthy tissues but frequently upregulated by tumors (Curigliano et al. 2013; Clin Cancer Res. 2013; 19(20):5564-71). HLA-G inhibits immune cells by directly binding to inhibitory receptors of the LIR-family, such as LILRB1, which allows tumor cells to evade immune recognition. On the other hand, VMAPRTLFL (SEQ ID NO. 2) is cleaved off the signal sequence of HLA-G and presented an HLA-E (Llano et al., 1998; European journal of immunology 28, 2854-2863), making HLA-G/HLA-E coexpressing tumors potentially susceptible to recognition by NKG2C+ NK cells.",
                                "Indeed, we could demonstrate this effect using a cell line transfected with HLA-G. Compared to the untransfected control, HLA-G-expressing cells specifically activated NKG2C+ NK cells, even in the context of low HLA-E expression (FIG. 15a-b, FIG. 16). The activation was blocked by an antibody against CD94 (FIG. 15c), demonstrating its role in recognition. These data demonstrate the reactivity of NKG2C+ NK cells against HLA G expressing targets. Since in this system HLA-G is extrinsically overexpressed to very high levels and the endogenous expression of HLA-E is low (Supp. FIG. 1), we assessed the activation under blockade of the inhibitory HLA-G receptor LILRB1. The blockade further increased the activation, arguing that the in vivo NK cell response might be even more pronounced, as endogenous expression of HLA-G will not be that much higher than of HLA-E and therefore the inhibitory signal through LILRB1 will be less dominant. Based on these findings, we propose the in vivo expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells as an immunotherapy to treat HLA-G/HLA-E co-expressing tumors.",
                                "To identify patients suitable for these treatment strategies, tumor biopsies or circulating tumor cells can be tested for HLA-G and HLA-E expression by flow cytometry or by RT-PCR. Isolated tumor cells from biopsies can also be directly tested for susceptibility to lysis by NKG2C+ adaptive NK cells in in vitro cytotoxicity assays using adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells. Our approach of NKG2C+ NK cell expansion might be especially valuable for patients receiving HSCT for the treatment of leukemia. In contrast to adaptive cell types targeted by classical vaccines, NK cells are among the first lymphocyte populations to recover after transplantation and therefore can be targeted early using our approach, thus potentially protecting against HCMV reactivation and tumor relapse. Secondly, an interesting correlation of reduced relapse rates in patients reactivating HCMV and presenting with adaptive NK cell expansions points towards an anti-leukemic effect of adaptive NK cells (Elmagaacli et al., Blood. 2011; 118(5):1402-12; Cichocki et al. Leukemia. 2016; 30(2):456-63.) Therefore, our approach might be of dual advantage for these patients, combining protective effects against HCMV with an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia response."
