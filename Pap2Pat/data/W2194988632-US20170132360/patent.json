    "title": "Method for Determining Relatedness of Genomic Samples Using Partial Sequence Information",
    "date": "2015-06-17 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Disclosed are methods for testing biological samples containing genomic nucleic acids obtained from an organism having a genome, such as a human genome. It is often desirable to analyze a DNA sample or more than one, different DNA samples, to determine whether the sample comes from one individual or two individuals. The present method requires very low amounts of DNA and can use partial sequences of DNA fragments. Partial sequences are analyzed for the presence of polymorphisms (e.g. SNP's) that can be mapped to a reference SNP map. The distance between similar SNPS, which are genetically linked, can be used to statistically determine a likelihood of identity of individuality in a sample.",

                        "Determining whether two DNA samples originate from the same individual is difficult when the amount of retrievable DNA is limited. In the field of Ancient DNA, DNA preservation and the amount of material available for extraction limit our ability to construct high-coverage shotgun sequencing libraries from historical samples. As a result, in two libraries prepared from the samples from the same individual, very few sequenced reads will overlap between libraries and even fewer will fall on polymorphic positions that can be used to verify their origin in a single individual.",
                        "Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing now allow for small DNA fragments to be extracted and sequenced from ancient or heavily degraded samples. DNA is now routinely extracted from bones, teeth, and hair from individuals that lived hundreds or thousands of years ago. Deep sequencing of well-preserved samples can yield many-fold coverage of the complete nuclear genome [1-3], but many more samples can offer only a low-coverage (<1\u00d7) view. This is due to several factors. First, the amount of endogenous DNA present varies greatly between samples and in most samples, endogenous DNA makes up only a small fraction of the extracted fragments. Deep sequencing and/or capture techniques can applied to enrich for human DNA, but this can be limited by a small starting number of intact fragments. In addition to this, some samples are limited by the material available for destructive sampling and extraction, e.g. single hairs or unique specimens. Low-coverage nuclear genomic sequence has provided key insights into human prehistory [4, 5] and analysis methods designed specifically for low-coverage sequence data are required as more ancient and historical samples are sequenced. Although DNA has been used for human identification for decades, current methods are not readily applicable to extremely low-coverage genome sequence. In certain embodiments a genome fragment such as a particular chromosome or a mitochondrion could be studied. In other embodiments an entire genome will be used.",
                        "The most basic strategy for determining if two samples are from the same individual is to identify the alleles found at known polymorphic sites for each sample and compare the results. If the two samples are from the same individual, all genotypes of DNA tested should match with the exceptions of differences caused by measurement error, allelic dropout, or somatic mutation. Low sequence coverage makes this difficult. First, identifying an individual requires identifying specific alleles at known polymorphic sites. Reads from a low coverage sample must overlap polymorphic positions in order to find alleles (bases) that differentiate the individual from others. The majority of positions in the genome will not have any observations in a single low coverage library. Comparing two low-coverage libraries compounds this problem, as very few positions will have observations in both libraries. This limits direct comparisons of alleles in different libraries to a very small number of informative sites.",
                        "Identification methods that rely on a handful of specific variable lengths of repetitive sequences, like CODIS, may not be suitable to highly fragmented DNA, where these loci may not have been sampled or remain intact. Alleles at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be identified from small fragments. SNP-based forensic analyses rely on a relatively small set (50-80) of heavily curated SNPs and most of these markers would not be observed in low-coverage shotgun sequencing of the genome. Out of all of the loci used in forensic analyses, the mitochondrial sequence (mtDNA) is most easily applied to ancient DNA, as its high cellular copy number often allows for the complete sequence to be assembled from libraries with low nuclear coverage. However, this single loci provides limited information on only the matrilineal ancestry of an individual and has no power to differentiate between individuals that share the same mtDNA sequence. We present a method for determining whether low-coverage shotgun data from two samples are derived from the same individual."

These reference panels can be obtained from publicly available data that describes the genetic correlations observed within human populations. We compare observed alleles at closely linked polymorphic sites (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) to determine whether they are consistent with the patterns of linkage present in the reference panel. Robustness of the method is shown by performing coalescent simulations (See, Arenas, M. and Posada, D. (2007) Recodon: Coalescent simulation of coding DNA sequences with recombination, migration and demography. BMC Bioinformatics 8: 458) to assess the power of the method to distinguish between pairs of simulated low-coverage libraries derived from a single individual or two individuals using a simulated reference panel.

It is a form of genotyping, which is the measurement of more general genetic variation. SNPs are one of the most common types of genetic variation. A SNP is a single base pair mutation at a specific locus, usually consisting of two alleles (where the rare allele frequency is >1%). SNPs are found to be involved in the etiology of many human diseases and are becoming of particular interest in pharmacogenetics. Because SNPs are conserved during evolution, they have been proposed as markers for use in quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis and in association studies in place of microsatellites. The use of SNPs is being extended in the HapMap project, which aims to provide the minimal set of SNPs needed to genotype the human genome. SNPs can also provide a genetic fingerprint for use in identity testing. The increase in interest in SNPs has been reflected by the furious development of a diverse range of SNP genotyping methods.",

Since majority of these positions will not be observed in a low-coverage library, our method does not rely on direct comparison of SNP alleles but instead uses a likelihood model to examine pairs SNPs in linkage disequilibrium to determine whether the observations are consistent with a single individual. To assess the utility of this approach, we tested it using simulated data and down sampled high-coverage sequence data.

                                "The term \u201ccoverage\u201d in terms of sequence coverage of a nucleic acid molecule is used in its conventional sense. In general, it is the number of times that a given nucleotide in the sequence has been read, or sequenced. A number like 80\u00d7 coverage means that, on average, each nucleotide will have been sequenced 80 times. It is important to note that this is only an average. Sequence coverage is further explained in Sims et al., \u201cSequencing depth and coverage: key considerations in genomic analyses,\u201d Nat. Rev. Gen. 15:121-132 (2014). By way of further example, a coverage 0.5%\u00d7 means that, as to the DNA molecules being sequenced, each base position will be observed 0.005 times. As described herein, the analysis of low coverage sequence libraries means between a lower limit of between about 0.1%\u00d7 (0.001\u00d7) and 0.5%\u00d7 (0.005). The present methods perform at higher coverage levels that are nonetheless below those useful with other known methods, e.g. coverages less than 10%\u00d7 (0.1\u00d7). Coverage is related to the idea that a nucleic acid sample is being sequenced in a random fashion, rather than targeting a specific sequence region. Further, the concept of coverage is related here to the ability to obtain a high coverage of sequencing. For example, low sequence coverage may result from a highly degraded sample, or a very small sample, where there is less than an amount of DNA necessary of other analysis methods. By way of example, an STR match has been reported to require a nanogram of DNA, whereas the present methods may be carried out on less, as described below.",

Some of these technologies are commercially available from Illumina Corp., Roche 454, Ion Torrent (Life Technologies) and others. These technologies use miniaturized and parallelized platforms for sequencing of 1 million to 43 billion short reads (50-400 bases each) per instrument run. (Wikipedia \u201cMassively parallel sequencing; see also Moorthie et al., \u201cReview of massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies,\u201d Hugo J. 5(1-4): 1-12 (2001).) An example of massively parallel sequencing is a commercial product available from Illumina Inc., San Diego Calif. In this (and other platforms) During DNA sequencing, the bases of a small fragment of DNA are sequentially identified from signals emitted as each fragment is re-synthesized from a DNA template strand. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) extends this process across millions of reactions in a massively parallel fashion. The slide is flooded with nucleotides and DNA polymerase. These nucleotides are fluorescently labelled, with the color corresponding to the base. They also have a terminator, so that only one base is added at a time. The slide is flooded with nucleotides and DNA polymerase. These nucleotides are fluorescently labelled, with the color corresponding to the base. They also have a terminator, so that only one base is added at a time. Computers are then used to detect the base at each site in each image and these are used to construct a sequence. All of the sequence reads will be the same length, as the read length depends on the number of cycles carried out. In Illumina sequencing, 100-150 bp reads are used. Since massively paralleling sequencing methods typically have limited read lengths, the methods will general a large number of independent sequences that are assembled as described above. Each independent sequence originates from a different DNA molecule in the sequencing library.",

It is further described in Morton, \u201c\u201cSequential tests for the detection of linkage\u201d. American Journal of Human Genetics 7 (3): 277-318 (1955). The LOD score compares the likelihood of obtaining the test data if the two loci are indeed linked, to the likelihood of observing the same data purely by chance. Positive LOD scores favor the presence of linkage, whereas negative LOD scores indicate that linkage is less likely. By convention, a LOD score greater than 3.0 is considered evidence for linkage, as it indicates 1000 to 1 odds that the linkage being observed did not occur by chance. On the other hand, a LOD score less than \u22122.0 is considered evidence to exclude linkage."

The present method is easily illustrated in a forensic situation where one wishes to match nucleic acids (DNA is used by way of example) from one hair (for example) with another hair. Also, the method may be used to determine if a recovered blood sample contains from blood of a single individual or more than one individual. The method comprises obtaining sequence information from known sequencing methods, even though very incomplete sequence information can be obtained. For example, in certain situations, only between about 1% and 10% of a genome (e.g. human genome, having 3\u00d7109 base pairs) can be sequenced from a sample.

This is found using the frequency of A and B appearing together estimated from the reference panel (f(A\u039bB)) and the frequencies of A and B in the reference panel (f(A), f(B). We assume that we are equally likely to make observations from each chromosome, so there is an equal probability of observing bases from the same chromosome (linked) and from different chromosomes (unlinked). Similarly in FORMULA 1B, P2 represents the probability of observing alleles A and B on independent (unlinked) chromosomes. Here the probability of observing both alleles is the product of their frequencies in the population. Again, we estimate these frequencies using the reference panel of haplotypes. As described below, these formulas are calculated (preferably using a computer) a log odds ratio for all linked pairs of SNPs.",
                                "Two loci are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) if their alleles are not randomly associated [11]. This non-random association implies that observing the allelic state of one locus provides some information about the state of the other. Similarly, our approach is based on the idea that observations made in one sample should not provide information about bases in another sample if the two individuals are unrelated. In other words, the probability of observing one combination of alleles at linked loci should be dependent on the allele frequencies if the two alleles originate from different chromosomes. However, if they both observations are made from the same chromosome, the probability of the observation is the frequency of that haplotype.",

We compare the probabilities of observing the first base given the observation of the second under two simple models. The first represents the case where the two bases have been drawn from independent chromosomes, so the probability of the observation is the frequency of the base in the population and is independent of the first base. The second model represents the case where the two bases where drawn from the same diploid individual, where there is an equal chance the two bases come from the same chromosome or independent chromosomes. The two models are compared as a log-likelihood ratio (LLR).",
                                "We aggregate the LLRs for pairs of SNPs by sampling pairs from sliding windows across each chromosome to avoid the effects of linkage and to mitigate the influence of heavily sampled regions. We model the genome-wide LLR at a random variable and build an empirical distribution by sampling across the genome many times. Positive values indicate support for the single diploid individual model, while negative values indicate the observations are more likely to be from two independent individuals.",
                                "This method is illustrated schematically in FIG. 3. A representation of a chromosome or related contiguous nucleic acid fragment is shown at 301. A reference panel of phased haplotypes (shown at 302) describes the known variants associated with this nucleic acid fragment (referred to for illustration purposes as a chromosome). Note that these variants, referred to and for illustration purposes as SNPs, are not randomly associated with each other in the phased polymorphism population (304) as mapped in the reference 302. In this illustration, 5 known SNPs are detected; data from SNPs 303, 305, 306 and 308 are used in two pair-wise calculations. Reads from two samples are mapped to the chromosome and alleles are observed at variant sites (e.g. 303 and 305). Pairs of observations are grouped for purpose of analysis and for calculating log-likelihood ratios using the reference panel. This illustration shows a single window or region of a chromosome where several comparisons of SNP pairs could be made (303-305 and 306-308). Any number of sliding windows (overlapping or non-overlapping) of various physical sizes on the chromosome can be used. For each window, a single pair comparison and calculated LLR is drawn to represent the window. LLR values are aggregated across windows by summation. Because multiple pair comparisons are available for each window, this step can be repeated using a bootstrapping approach",
                                "The method can be applied to sets of base observations made within a single sample and between two samples. Within-sample comparisons are used to examine how consistent the observations made from a single sample are with a single diploid individual, given the reference population. Positive LLR values indicate that the sample is consistent with a diploid individual that originated from a population closely related to the reference panel. Negative LLR values or values not significantly different from zero can be the result of the reference panel being too distantly related from the sample individual or the sample itself being a mixture of fragments from more than one individual. Between-sample comparisons are made to examine how consistent two sets of base observations are with originating in a single diploid individual. Ideally, each sample should be compared with itself first, before comparing it with another library.",
                                "The method begins with a SNP reference panel of haplotypes from a population chosen based on a priori knowledge or previous analyses to best represent the population from which the samples originated. For each sample, we examine reads that overlap SNP positions from the panel to identify the base at that position. Bases that do not match one of the two alleles from the reference panel are discarded. Observations for positions where multiple reads map are omitted. The majority of positions will have no observation.",
                                "In selecting pairs of SNPs used in calculating LLR values, one should consider the proximity of the SNPs, the minor allele frequency, and the possible misinformation caused by damage bases. A variety of SNP databases can be used in analyzing sequence results from the present method. In addition the present method may use only SNPs that are informative to the present method. As of Jun. 15, 2015, the National Center of Biotechnology Information's dbSNP databases contains over 90 million validated SNPs found in the human genome (http(colon slash slash) www (dot)ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_summary.cgi?view+summary=view+summary&build_id=144). SNPs used by this method should have minor alleles found at low to intermediate frequencies so that linkage disequilibrium can be identified and quantified with confidence. Presently used SNPs preferably are uniquely mapped to the human genome. These may be selected by identifying SNPs that occur in unique base pair contexts in the human reference genome. For example, this can be achieved using a database such as the UCSC genome browser and the Duke 35-mer Mapability track to select SNPs that occur in unique 35 base pair segments. Also, SNPs that represent transversions rather than transitions are preferred, to avoid errors caused by DNA damage or multiple mutation hits that may occur with transition mutations.",

Segregating sites with minor allele frequencies lower than 10% were removed. For diploid individuals, we simulated base observations from low-coverage sequencing by drawing a single allele from segregating sites randomly chosen at a rate of 0.01.

SNPs must be polymorphic in our reference panel but it is not clear what the minimum minor allele count should be. Rare alleles represent the majority of our available markers, but they are not as informative at common alleles in strong LD. Furthermore, it is difficult to confidently describe the linkage between two alleles when only a few observations are available. A balance must be struck that allows for many informative pairs to be observed throughout the genome. We filtered for biallelic SNPs that were polymorphic in the target population (CEU, GBR, etc.) with a minimum minor allele count of 10. SNPs must occur in uniquely mapping regions of the genome. To avoid errors from mismapped reads, we restricted our panels to sites where all overlapping 35 mers are unique across hg19 according to the Duke Mapability track on the UCSC Genome Browser. In other words, we filtered for SNPs that occur in unique 35-mers. Finally, to avoid errors caused by DNA damage for historic samples, we only consider SNPs that represent transversion mutations (no C,T or A,G polymorphic sites)."

Under a simple demographic model of a single population of constant size (Ne=10,000), we found our method can consistently distinguish between two single allele observation sets that originate from the same or different individuals (FIG. 1A) when the reference panel and diploid individuals are drawn from the same population. Thus, sets of base observations made from the same diploid individual are distinguishable from those made from different individuals. Genotypes for diploid individuals and a reference panel of haplotypes were simulated under a simple demographic model of a constant effective population size of 10,000. Sets of base observations (libraries) were simulated by drawing random alleles from segregating sites chosen at a rate of 0.01, approximating 1%\u00d7 coverage of the genome. The simulation was repeated 100 times with each line in the plot representing one comparison. In the case where the sampled individuals are from a population related to the reference population, it is still possible to differentiate between samples that come from one individual or two, but this becomes increasingly difficult as the number of generations since the split of these populations increases (FIG. 1B). In other words, comparisons made between the same and different individuals can still be distinguished when the reference panel is drawn from a related but diverged population. Under a demographic model where the diploid individuals are drawn from a distinct population related to the reference panel's population, sample pairs that originate from different diploid individuals can still be identified. As the time separating the two populations increases and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium diverge, the power to discern between one and two individuals decreases.",

We simulated diploid individuals and reference population panels for three subpopulations representing subpopulations sampled from Africa, Asia and Europe. Importantly, this model features historical bottlenecks that increase and restructure LD in the effected subpopulations. Simulated libraries that were made from the same individual can be distinguished from those made from different individuals when the individuals and reference panel were drawn from the same subpopulation; in other words, comparisons made within each subpopulation can differentiate between samples that come from one or two individuals (FIG. 1C). We also found that the increased LD in subpopulations affected by bottlenecks offers more power in these comparisons; subpopulations with higher levels of linkage disequilibrium (for example, non-Africans) offer more information that can be used to make the comparisons. We also found that these events also limit the power of comparisons where the samples and the reference population are drawn from distinct subpopulations. This highlights the importance of choosing a suitable reference panel."

With coverage levels 0.005 fold and higher, we have found that comparisons between the same and different individuals are distinct and easily differentiable.
