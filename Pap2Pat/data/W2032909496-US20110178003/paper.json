    "abstract": "Viral fusogenic envelope proteins are important targets for the development of inhibitors of viral entry. We report an approach for the computational design of peptide inhibitors of the dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) envelope (E) protein using high-resolution structural data from a pre-entry dimeric form of the protein. By using predictive strategies together with computational optimization of binding pseudoenergies, we were able to design multiple peptide sequences that showed low micromolar viral entry inhibitory activity. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, were designed to displace regions in the domain II hinge, and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection, respectively, and show fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of 8 and 7 microM respectively in a focus forming unit assay. The antiviral peptides were shown to interfere with virus:cell binding, interact directly with the E proteins and also cause changes to the viral surface using biolayer interferometry and cryo-electron microscopy, respectively. These peptides may be useful for characterization of intermediate states in the membrane fusion process, investigation of DENV receptor molecules, and as lead compounds for drug discovery.",

                "Fusogenic viral envelope glycoproteins are multimeric proteins that facilitate the fusion of viral and target cell lipid membranes during the initiation of infection. The membrane fusion process is energetically favorable and essentially irreversible, but has a considerable kinetic energy barrier [1]. These proteins allow rapid membrane fusion by drawing the opposing membranes together and either stabilizing or providing the activation energy to surmount the transition state [1], [2]. In this way, they behave in many aspects like a fusion catalyst. Because they effect a macromolecular process that involves large scale conformational changes in the substrate membranes and the proteins themselves, these proteins possess multiple interacting surfaces that could be targeted by inhibitors [3].",
                "There are several distinct types of viral fusion proteins, including the class I, primarily alpha helical proteins (such as HIV TM and influenza HA), the class II, primarily beta sheet proteins (such as the flavivirus E and alphavirus E1), and mixed helix/sheet proteins (including herpes virus gB and rhabdovirus G) [3], [4]. To date, most progress with viral fusion protein inhibitors has focused on class I alpha helical proteins. The HIV TM protein provides an excellent example of targeting distinct, interacting surfaces for inhibition. The HIV TM functions as a homotrimer with each monomer contributing two alpha helical regions that interact to form a post-fusion six-helix bundle. Inhibition of the formation of this six-helix bundle can be accomplished by exogenous peptides mimicking either of the two reciprocally interacting helices [5]\u2013[7].",
                "Only a few examples of viral entry inhibitors with activity against the primarily beta sheet envelope proteins (E) from flaviviruses have been described [8]\u2013[10]. However, few of these have taken advantage of the available crystal structures of flavivirus E proteins, including both pre-fusion and post-fusion forms [11]\u2013[22]. The authors of some of these structures have predicted that several regions of these proteins might be targets for inhibition [11], [14], [15]. Here we report the use of structural data from the pre-fusion dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) E protein as a model for a computational approach to the design of new peptide inhibitors of DENV-2 entry. This approach makes use of a residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) score to identify in situ amino acid sequences that are likely to have high structural and binding stability [23], [24]. Out of seven computationally designed peptides that were synthesized and tested, two were identified as possessing fifty percent in vitro inhibitory activity (IC50) below 10 \u00b5M and another with IC50 activity below 40 \u00b5M. Two of the inhibitors (DN57opt and DN81opt) are binding optimized variants of peptides originally designed from DENV inhibitory peptide sequences located in domain II near the domain I/domain II hinge region [9]. The other (1OAN1) is an entirely novel peptide designed from an extended beta sheet region comprising the first connection between domains I and II. We show that the two peptides with the highest inhibitory activity interfere with virus:cell binding, cause structural changes to the surface of DENV-2 virions, and bind specifically to purified DENV-2 E protein.",
                "The causative agent of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, DENV has emerged in the past several decades as the most important mosquito borne viral disease with an estimated 2.5 billion people living in areas at risk for epidemic transmission and 50\u2013100 million people infected annually [25], [26]. Complicating this situation, the four distinct serotypes of DENV generate only low level immunological cross protection, allowing for repeated epidemic outbreaks in the same populations [27], [28]. The phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement has been shown to result in more severe disease in individuals who have been previously infected with a different serotype [29]\u2013[33]. With no specific treatment or prevention available other than vector control, DENV is an important target for the development of antivirals and vaccines. The results presented here indicate that the DENV E glycoprotein has multiple accessible surfaces that can be targeted by distinct inhibitors and is an amenable target for rational inhibitor design."

                        "Peptide inhibitors were designed to have improved in situ binding compared to naturally occurring sequences using the residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) [24]. The x-ray diffraction structure of DENV-2 envelope protein (Protein Data Bank identifier 1OAN) was used as a template for creating mutant structures from which the peptides were derived [14]. For each peptide, we randomly selected a residue side chain and substituted it with a new side chain. The substitution was performed using a backbone-dependent side chain rotamer library and a linear repulsive steric energy term provided by SCWRL version 3.0 [34]. The resulting all-atom models were energy minimized for 200 steps using the Energy Calculation and Dynamics (ENCAD) program [35]\u2013[37]. RAPDF scores were then calculated to estimate the structural stability of a given E protein structure derivative. For a selected residue, side chain substitution was carried out ten times. The amino acid that produced the best RAPDF score was selected and used as a template for further mutation. The entire mutation process was repeated 100,000 times to enable a rigorous search for peptides that produced the best RAPDF score (i.e., highest predicted stability)."

                        "A 20 residue acid sliding window that moved from the N to the C terminus of the E protein in 10 residue acid increments was evaluated by a structural stability (pseudoenergy) optimization protocol using the RAPDF. A Metropolis Monte Carlo search algorithm [38] was used to change each amino acid in the 20 residue window to one of the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids, and the stability of corresponding peptide in the context of the entire E protein structure was evaluated. This process was iterated 100,000 times using RAPDF as the target scoring function. The Metropolis criterion was used to select a particular change in the simulation: if a particular change resulted in a better RAPDF score (lower pseudoenergy), then it was retained. If a particular change resulted in a worse RAPDF score (higher pseudoenergy), then a random choice, based on the score difference between the previous change and the current one, was made to retain the corresponding change. This procedure enables not only enables design of peptides that will result in high structural and binding stability (i.e., the best RAPDF scores/pseudoenergies), but also enables surmounting local minima encountered during the search. Computational optimization was performed on the four regions corresponding to the best RAPDF score, and therefore the highest binding potential, within the E protein as described above to generate variant peptides sequences."

Four de novo designed peptides, 1OAN1, 1OAN2, 1OAN3, and 1OAN4 were also tested for inhibitory activity using the same FFU reduction assay (Figure 2C). 1OAN1 was found to be an effective inhibitor of DENV-2 infection with an IC50 of 7\u00b14 \u00b5M and a maximum inhibition of 99% at 50 \u00b5M. A scrambled version of 1OAN1 (1OAN1scr) did not inhibit infection by DENV-2 at any concentration tested (Figure 2D). In addition to these full dose response inhibition experiments using approximately 100 infectious units of virus, both the DN57opt and 1OAN1 peptides were also capable of inhibiting 4,000 infectious units of virus (data not shown)."

                        "Because toxicity could result in a decrease in focus formation and be interpreted as evidence of antiviral activity, the inhibitory peptides and their scrambled versions were assessed for cellular toxicity. Confluent monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells used in FFU reduction assays were exposed to increasing concentrations of peptide before measuring mitochondrial reductase activity using an MTT mitochondrial reductase activity assay (Figure 3). When we initially performed these assays to exactly mimic the focus forming unit assay by waiting five days after peptide exposure, we saw no evidence of toxicity at any concentration of any peptide (data not shown). However, we found that a shorter post-exposure incubation time revealed a subtle toxicity on the part of one of the peptides. Apparently, waiting more than 24 h post-exposure gives the cells a chance to recover and conceals this effect. At 24 h post-exposure, DN57opt was found to be mildly toxic to cells at 40 \u00b5M (one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post hoc test, P\u200a=\u200a0.0004, N\u200a=\u200a18), so only inhibitory data using lower, nontoxic concentrations was considered.

            "paragraphs": [
                "We have used computational methods to design multiple peptide inhibitors of the DENV E glycoprotein. Importantly, out of seven peptides synthesized and tested, two peptides with high activity and one peptide with intermediate activity were identified. A high resolution crystal structure of the pre-fusion conformation of the DENV-2 E [14] was used as the starting point to generate in situ energy minimized peptides. Two distinct approaches were used for the design of these peptides. First, we built upon previous work targeting DENV fusion peptide and domain II hinge regions with naturally occurring E protein sequences from these regions [9]. No inhibitory activity was found for the optimized fusion peptide region sequence (DN80opt), indicating that this region may not be a promising target mechanistically for DENV peptide inhibitors. Since an analogous, naturally occurring WNV domain II hinge region peptide was shown to be inhibitory against WNV [9], we reasoned that a more tightly binding analog of this region in the DENV E protein could be designed and might have improved inhibitory activity. This turned out to be correct, and we identified two distinct binding-optimized peptide sequences to this region with antiviral activity, DN57opt and DN81opt. This supports previous predictions of hinge region inhibitors and the proposed mechanism of fusion based on hinge region movements [11], [14], [15]. The second approach to designing peptide inhibitors was to identify peptides with non-native sequences derived from E protein regions that are highly stable in terms of structure and binding as evaluated by an all-atom scoring function (RAPDF). This identified four regions that were used to derive additional optimized peptides (Figure 1). Of the four resulting peptides tested, one, 1OAN1, was identified as having antiviral activity. This confirms the use of the sliding window RAPDF minimization approach for finding tightly binding protein ligands [23], [24]. It is perhaps not surprising that computational binding optimization increased the activity of previously inactive peptides that were based on naturally occurring E protein sequences. Naturally occurring sequences have multiple balancing selection pressures that may limit their binding stability in vivo. The combined use of primary sequence prediction tools [9] and structural optimization tools [23], [24] should be a valuable approach for finding binding partners and inhibitors for other protein targets.",
                "Neither peptide showed inhibitory activity when added directly to cells after infection had already occurred, indicating that the peptides were acting during an entry step in the virus life cycle, and sequence scrambled versions of the two most active peptides were inactive, confirming sequence specific activity. Both peptides also block virus:cell binding, but are still capable of inhibiting infection even when added after virions have already bound to the surface of target cells.",
                "CryoEM was used to visualize the effect of the peptides on DENV-2 virions. The surface of virions appeared to change from smooth to rough after incubation with the antiviral peptides. This suggests that there may be an alteration of the arrangement of the surface envelope protein (Figure 4). Biolayer interferometry was used to measure the kinetics of binding between the peptides and soluble, truncated E protein (Figure 5). These binding studies showed a direct interaction between the peptides and DENV-2 E protein with affinities in the 1 \u00b5M range and relatively fast on/off rates. The cryoEM images demonstrate that these inhibitory peptides probably cause structural deformations in intact viral particles, but do not provide information about the kinetics of these changes. It is possible that the peptides trap the viral E proteins in some conformation that is part of the normal breathing of the viral particles, and that this interferes with cell binding and entry.",
                "The DN57opt and 1OAN1 peptides were designed for optimized binding to the pre-fusion E structure and we show direct evidence for this interaction, both with the purified, monomeric E protein, and with virion particles. These peptides likely function by displacing portions of the E protein and interfering with normal cell binding or the structural changes during entry. Although separate in the primary protein sequence, the regions targeted in the design the DN57 and 1OAN1 peptides are partially adjacent to each other in the crystal structure, with the C terminus of the 1OAN1 region occupying a pocket surrounded by the DN57 region (See Figure 1). We stress that we do not know the structures of the bound and inhibited peptide/E protein complexes, but these structures may shed light on the mechanistic details of cell binding and fusion. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that both of these peptides interact directly with DENV-2 E proteins and are entry inhibitors.",
                "Despite difficulties with oral administration and degradation in the digestive tract, peptides may make useful antiviral agents when targeted against viral envelope proteins. Directing inhibitors to viral surface proteins avoids the major difficulty of crossing cellular membranes in order to reach the target. For example, peptide inhibitors of intercellular viral targets, such as proteases or polymerases, would need to cross the cell plasma membrane, and in the case of flaviviruses, possibly internal membrane bound replication and assembly compartments. The HIV entry inhibitor T-20 (Fuzeon) is a peptide, and in the context of a chronic infection, repeated life-long injections are problematic. DENV is an acute infection and most severe DENV infections require intravenous fluid support, facilitating delivery of anti-DENV peptides by this route.",
                "We have established the existence of multiple, distinct inhibitory peptides targeting the DENV E glycoprotein and confirmed the utility of rational design using structural data for developing DENV E protein inhibitors. Applications of this strategy should also be possible for the generation and refinement of lead compounds for other viral envelope fusion proteins. It would be optimistic to propose that any single antiviral would provide an effective treatment for DENV given the enormous genetic variability of the four serotypes and multiple substrains. Different classes of inhibitors targeting the E protein and other DENV targets [44], [45], could form the basis for the development of a combination treatment plan to combat this disease."
