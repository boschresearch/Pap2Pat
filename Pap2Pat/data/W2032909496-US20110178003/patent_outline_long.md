# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- inhibitors bindable to regions of a virus, particularly dengue virus envelope glycoprotein

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- dengue virus imposes a large social and economic burden
- no specific treatment for infection, and control of dengue virus by vaccination has proved elusive
- enveloped viruses enter cells by membrane fusion
- structural protein E of the flavivirus mediates receptor binding and fusion
- class II viral fusion proteins are found in flaviviruses, alphaviruses, and Hepatitis C
- mechanism of fusion of class II viral fusion proteins is not well-understood

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- peptide entry inhibitors bindable to regions in viral class II E proteins
- interaction of an inhibitor with such regions inhibits viral fusion and infectivity
- compounds and methods of screening against these bindable regions to discover therapeutic candidates
- diseases for which a therapeutic candidate may be screened include dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, etc.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- methods of inhibiting dengue infection that includes inhibiting the fusion between the virion envelope and a cell membrane
- any peptide or protein which inhibits the fusion between the dengue virion envelope and a cell membrane may be used
- bindable region refers to a region of a dengue virus E protein which is a target for binding an agent
- dengue peptide entry inhibitor is 10AN having a SEQ ID No. 1
- peptides related to the dengue peptide entry inhibitor include homologous peptides
- dengue peptide entry inhibitors may be linked to a carrier molecule such as a protein
- dengue entry inhibitory peptides may be utilized to inhibit dengue virus virion:cell fusion
- methods for administering peptides to patients are well known
- techniques can be used to screen, identify, select and design chemical entities capable of associating with a dengue virus E protein
- knowledge of the structure for a dengue virus E protein permits the design and/or identification of molecules
- method of drug design generally includes computationally evaluating the potential of a selected chemical compound
- Monte Carlo method is a technique which obtains a probabilistic approximation to the solution of a problem
- Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale is a tool for exploring the topology and other features of membrane proteins

### Preparation of Dengue Peptide Entry Inhibitors

- peptides may be produced from naturally occurring or recombinant viral proteins

### Viruses and Cells

- DENV-1 strain HI-1, DENV-2 strain NG-2, DENV-3 strain H-78, and DENV

### Focus Forming Unit (FFU) Reduction Assay

- LLCMK-2 target cells were seeded at a density of 1Ã—105 cells
- virus/chemistry or virus/control mixtures were allowed to infect confluent target cell monolayers

### Cytoxicity Assay

- cytotoxicity of the chemistries was measured by monitoring mitochondrial reductase activity

### Mechanistic Assays with 10AN

- post-entry focus-forming assay with 10AN against DENV-2
- pre-binding focus-forming assay with 10AN against DENV-2
- post-binding focus-forming assay with 10AN against DENV-2
- qRT-PCR virus binding assay
- infection of LLCMK-2 target cells in six well plates was performed in duplicate
- viral RNA was extracted from the cell pellets using the Qiagen Viral RNA Extraction kit
- quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR was performed on the extracted RNA

### Analysis

- figures were generated using the Origin 6.0 graphing software

### Results

- inhibition assays were used to quantitate the inhibitory activities of each chemistry against DENV-2

### Cytotoxicity

- effect of the chemistry on the mitochondrial reductase activity of the target cells was measured
- no sign of toxicity was observed with any compound compared to medium only controls
- pre-binding focus-forming assay with 10AN against DENV-2
- qRT-PCR virus binding assay with 10AN against DENV-2
- 10AN does not prevent virus binding/attachment to target cells under the experimental condition tested
