# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

- inhibitors for dengue virus

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- dengue virus and flaviviruses
- viral fusion and entry
- need for entry inhibitors

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- peptide entry inhibitors for dengue virus
- methods for identifying and using inhibitors

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- methods of inhibiting dengue infection
- bindable regions of dengue virus E protein
- dengue peptide entry inhibitors and derivatives
- administration and treatment of dengue virus infection
- design and identification of inhibitors
- computational methods for inhibitor design

### Preparation of Dengue Peptide Entry Inhibitors

- production and synthesis of peptides

### Viruses and Cells

- viruses and cell lines used in the invention

### Focus Forming Unit (FFU) Reduction Assay

- method for measuring viral infectivity

### Cytoxicity Assay

- method for measuring cell toxicity

### Mechanistic Assays with 10AN

- post-entry focus-forming assay
- pre-binding focus-forming assay
- qRT-PCR virus binding assay

### Analysis

- statistical analysis and graphing software

### Results
