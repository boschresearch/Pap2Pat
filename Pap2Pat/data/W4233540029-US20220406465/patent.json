                        "More than 10% of the United States population\u2014at least 34.2 million people\u2014is affected by diabetes mellitus (hereinafter \u201cdiabetes\u201d). The mental health needs among people with diabetes are well documented. Approximately 25% of people with diabetes experience significant depressive symptoms and 10% to 15% are formally diagnosed with a depressive disorder. Approximately 27% to 40% of people with diabetes experience significant anxious symptoms and 14% are formally diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These statistics are up to 2 to 3 times greater than for people without diabetes, and do not include the increased prevalence of other mental health concerns such as disordered eating and diabetes distress. Beyond prevalence, the health and economic burdens associated with co-morbid diabetes and mental health are significant. Those with co-morbid diabetes and mental health have been found to be less adherent to diabetes treatment recommendations, including diet, exercise, medication use, glucose monitoring, and medical appointments, and at greater risk for adverse medical outcomes. Healthcare costs for those with co-morbid diabetes and mental health have been estimated to be $4 billion to $9 billion greater than for those without.",
                        "Proactive detection of mental health needs among people with diabetes could facilitate early intervention, thereby improving the overall health and quality of life of people with diabetes and reducing the health and economic burdens placed on the diabetes population and healthcare system as a whole. Yet, the current state of mental health detection in people with diabetes is poor. Despite recommendations by the American Diabetes Association and United States Preventive Services Task Force to routinely evaluate people with diabetes for mental health needs, only 25% to 50% of people with diabetes who have depression receive a mental health diagnosis and intervention. There are myriad reasons for this, including a shortage of mental health professionals available to offer assessment and intervention, lack of mental health knowledge among primary care providers who most often care for subjects with diabetes, and limited access to mental health screening tools in healthcare practices offering services to subjects with diabetes."

                        "There is a clear need for improvement in the methods used to detect mental health needs in people with diabetes. Existing methods are not scalable in that they rely on trained professionals to deliver assessment and are effortful and time-intensive in that they require subjects to actively respond to questions about their emotional and mental state. Newer methods, such as passive sensing and ecological momentary assessment (EMA), are more scalable and less effortful and time-intensive.",
                        "Passive sensing refers to the capture of data about a person without extra effort on their part. EMA refers to the repeated sampling of behavior in real-time within the natural environment. Both methods can be integrated into or with devices and services people with diabetes already utilize in their daily lives, such as blood glucose (BG) meters, smartphones, and health coaching, and therefore require little to no additional effort and time. And because they enable the collection and processing of data in real time and context, they can serve as a springboard for just-in-time adaptive interventions\u2014interventions that can be used for people at the very moment they need them.",
                        "Passive sensing and EMA have previously been examined in the detection of mental health concerns among the general population, but few have focused on the detection of mental health needs among people with diabetes in particular. Previous efforts focused narrowly on smartphones as data warehouses, relying on accelerometer, GPS, ambient light sensor, and call log data. They have also used traditional assessments and measures as validation measures\u2014for example, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). No known effort to date has attempted to detect mental health concerns in people with diabetes via BG meters. However, there is a rationale for doing so. People with diabetes are encouraged to engage with their BG meters at regular intervals, BG monitoring has been correlated with psychological effects, and BG engagement and BG level may indicate mood or stress. Further, BG meter data can be paired with data from other sources for a robust view of a person's behavioral and emotional profile.",

                        "FIG. 1 illustrates a system 100 for training a machine learning (ML) system 102 for mental health (MH) risk detection in diabetes patients. The ML system includes a ML model 104 that may be trained using a plurality of MH risk input signals 106 and MH status data 108 from a plurality of subjects.",
                        "The MH risk signals 106 may generally be divided into four categories based on their respective sources: glucometer data 110; coaching data 112; demographics data 114; and event data 116. These data may be collected from a plurality of subjects, who may be participating in a diabetes management program. An example of such a program is that provided by Livongo Health, Inc., of Mountain View, Calif.",
                        "Each subject 118 may have a blood glucometer 120, such as the Livongo BG300. Generally, the glucometer 120 is used to analyze a sample of the subject's blood and calculate the subject's blood glucose level. The glucometer 120 may store a history of the subject's glucose checks in database in an on-board data storage system. Each glucose check record may be stored in association with the date and time of the check, as well as other information. For example, when the subject 118 uses the glucometer 120 to check their blood glucose level, the glucometer may query the subject 118 for additional information. The glucometer may prompt the subject 118 to input how they are feeling at the time of the check; whether they consumed a meal before the check; and/or whether the subject exercised before the check. All or portions of this glucometer data 110 may be included among the MH risk input signals provided to the ML system. By way of example, the glucometer data 110 may be transferred via a wireless Bluetooth connection to another device such as the subject's smartphone 122.",
                        "The subject's smartphone 122 and/or other web-enabled device, such as a laptop 124, may also be sources of MH risk input signals 106. By way of example, the subject 118 may use their laptop 124 to enroll in the diabetes management program and input demographics data 114 when establishing their patient profile. In another example, the subject may log into a web portal and interact with a diabetes coach via laptop 124. In yet another example, the subject may interact with coaches via a mobile app installed on the smartphone 122. And in yet another example, the subject may use the mobile app on their smartphone 122 to share health progress reports with friends and family members via one or more social media platforms. Subjects may also use the mobile app or web portal for food logging and integration with other devices and programs, such a blood pressure device and hypertension management program, and connection to a Fitbit\u00ae device and/or Apple\u00ae Healthkit\u00ae.",
                        "The ML system 102 may employ any suitable machine learning approach. In one embodiment, the ML system 102 employs a supervised machine learning system such as a deep learning neural network or gradient boosting algorithm such as LightGBM. The ML system 102 may be embodied in a software module that executes on one or more servers coupled to one or more networks (not shown) that connect other devices in system 100, such as the Internet. Alternatively, the ML system 102, or portions of it, may execute on the subject's devices or a healthcare provider's device.",

In one embodiment, the training set provided to the ML system 102 includes a set of MH risk input signals for a plurality of subjects over a predetermined period of time. Each subject whose data is included in the training set may also be labelled to indicate whether the subject is known to have a MH condition. This data labelling may be accomplished using the MH status data 108. The MH status data 108 may come from various sources, including MH medication data 126, MH assessment data 128, MH claims data 130, and MH intervention data 132. The system 100 may query and receive this information from a subject's pharmacy, medical record, medical provider, insurance provider, diabetes management program profile, and/or other sources of health information on the subject 118.",
                        "The MH medication data 126 may include information on whether each subject has been prescribed and/or filled a prescription for certain medications used to treat MH conditions. For example, if the MH medication data 126 indicates that a particular subject has received and filled a prescription for Prozac or its generic equivalent, that particular subject may be labelled as having a MH condition in the training set.",
                        "The MH assessment data 128 may include information from past medical assessments of the subjects. For example, if the MH assessment data 128 indicates that a particular subject was seen by a psychiatrist and diagnosed with depression, that particular subject may be labelled has having a MH condition in the training set. Similarly, the MH intervention data 128 may include information on past MH-related interventions for the subjects. For example, if the MH intervention data 128 indicates that a particular subject received suicide counseling, that particular subject may be labelled has having a MH condition in the training set.",
                        "The MH claims data 130 may include information related to MH medication, MH assessment, and MH intervention, like those discussed above, but derived from each subject's insurance claims information, as opposed to pharmacy records, medical records, or other sources.",
                        "FIG. 2 defines a number of MH risk input signals in the demographics data 114 and glucometer data 110 categories discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. Demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race have been shown to be related to mental health. Thus, these and other factors may be included among the MH risk input signals to the ML system 102.",
                        "Glucometer data 110 in FIG. 2 defines a number of signals in the glucometer data 110 category. The glucometer is a frequent interaction point for people with diabetes, and particularly those enrolled in diabetes management programs. Low rates of blood glucose monitoring and poorer blood glucose control have been linked to depression among those with diabetes. Similarly, depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms are greater among people with diabetes than people without. Differences in glucometer usage is particularly informative of conditions such as depression when examining usage time of day and weekday. Accordingly, volume of BG checks, BG values and variations, and responses to questions to assess context such as current emotional state and check time of day and day of week, and other signals in the glucometer data 110 may be useful indicators in assessing MH risk in a subject.",
                        "FIG. 3 defines a number of MH risk input signals in the coaching data 112 and event data 116 categories. With regard to the coaching data 112, in some diabetes management programs, coaches may contact participants under certain conditions. As numerous studies have affirmed, there are relationships between sociability and mental health. For example, fewer calls and fewer incoming SMS (or \u201ctext\u201d) messages have been linked to depression. In addition, frequency and duration of conversations have been shown to be useful in evaluation of bipolar disorder. The coaching data 112 input signals shown in FIG. 2 can serve as a poxy for sociability. The number, rate, and/or changes in rates of successful or failed coaching contacts and time spent interacting with coaches can provide meaningful insight into a subjects MH risk. Further, changes in the number or rate of successful or unsuccessful contacts via specific communication platforms (e.g., voice calling, text messaging, email, and/or glucometer-based communication) can also be used to identify MH risk in a subject.",
                        "The event data 116 shown in FIG. 3 may also provide useful MH risk input signals. The event data 116 may include data concerning all types of interactions between a subject and the diabetes management program across all available platforms, including mobile apps and web platforms associated with the program. By way of example, the system may collect the frequency, duration, interactivity, and consistency of interaction sessions with the diabetes management program mobile app and web portal. In addition, the system may track whether, how often, and how consistently subjects voluntarily share reports with friends and family members, as well as interactions with pop-up reminders.",
                        "To the extent that the data received from the various inputs (e.g., glucometer, mobile device, laptop, and demographics) are not already formatted or expressed in the form or definition of the MH risk input signals 106 discussed above, the ML system 102 may include a pre-processor for formatting the data accordingly. Alternatively, this step can occur elsewhere in the system. For example, if the received glucometer data 110 includes a series of blood glucose values, but not a standard deviation of blood glucose values, the ML system 102 or some other processor may calculate the standard deviation of the blood glucose values and either insert the standard deviation into the MH risk input signals or otherwise use the calculated standard deviation as the corresponding MH risk input signal 106.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows a system 400 for mental health risk assessment in diabetes patients in accordance with the present disclosure. The system 400 may include an ML system 402 with an ML model 404 that has been trained using a training set of mental health risk input signals and mental health status data as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1-3. A diabetes patient or subject 406 may interact with various devices as part of a diabetes management program. For example, the subject 406 may check their blood glucose levels using a glucometer 408. The subject may also interact with a diabetes coach using a mobile app on their smartphone 410 or by logging on to a web portal using a web-enabled device such as a laptop 412. Data about these interactions may be collected by the system in the form of MH risk input signals 414. These signals may include glucometer data 416, coaching data 418, demographics data 420, and event data 422, as discussed above.",
                        "The collected MH risk input signals may be fed into the ML system 402 for analysis using the trained ML model 404, which then outputs an MH risk score 424. The MH risk score may indicate a degree of confidence that the subject 406 presents with a mental health condition. The MH risk score 424 may be output as a statistical confidence value expressed as, for example, a decimal between 0 and 1 or a percentage between 0 and 100. In another embodiment, the MH risk score 424 may presented as a confidence value that has been discretized into a number of ranges, such as \u201clow risk\u201d, \u201cmedium risk\u201d, and \u201chigh risk\u201d. The MH risk score 424 may additionally or alternatively be presented graphically, such as with a bar graph, gauge, dial, or color scheme. The MH risk score 424 may be presented on a display interface to a healthcare provider 426. In one embodiment, the score 424 could be made available to or otherwise presented to a coach or healthcare provider during a communication session with the subject 406. The MH risk score 424 may also serve as an input to another computer program or application, or otherwise be used to automatically trigger an alert or notification to a healthcare provider 426 that the subject 406 presents a mental health risk.",
                        "The ML system 402 may also include a feedback process 428 to update and refine the ML model 404. The feedback can come from any number of sources, including the subject's coaches, healthcare providers, family, friends, the subject themselves, and/or additional or other training data. In one embodiment, the system 400 may determine, based on the subject's input signals 414 that the subject 406 has a high MH risk score. The system 400 may alert a healthcare provider 426 that the subject 406 has a high MH risk score. The healthcare provider 426 may than schedule an evaluation with the subject 406. Once the subject has been evaluated, the healthcare provider 426 may interface with the feedback process 428 to indicate whether the evaluation revealed the presence of an MH condition in the subject 406. The healthcare provider's evaluation may also be automatically fed back into the ML system 402 via the feedback process 428. The ML system may then update its internal model(s) 404 and provide different weights to various inputs, thereby improving the accuracy of the MH risk score 424 in the future.",
                        "The feedback process 428 may update the machine learning system 402, using, for example, a gradient descent algorithm and back propagation and the like as will be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the art. In some examples, the machine learning system 402 may be updated in real time or near real time. In other examples, the machine learning system 402 may perform model updates as a background process on a mirror version of the machine learning system 402 and directly update the machine learning system 402 once the mirror version has converged on an updated model. In still other examples, the feedback process 428 may perform updates on a schedule or through a batch process. The updates can be performed on a singular device or may be performed across parallelized threads and processes and the like.",
                        "FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a process 500 for detecting MH risk in diabetes patients using blood glucometer data in accordance with the present disclosure. The process may begin at step 502 with the collection of MH risk input signals and MH status data from a first set of subjects. Next, at step 504, a training set is created using the collected MH risk input signals and MH status data. In one embodiment, this involves using the MH status data to label each subject's associated input signals as either having or not having a mental health condition. At step 506, the training set is provided to the ML system to in a training stage to create the ML model.",
                        "Next, the ML model created in step 506 may be validated. In one embodiment, this is accomplished by collecting MH risk input signals and MH status data from a second set of subjects at step 508 and creating a validation set from those data at step 510. The validation set is then provided to the ML system and the results are validated at step 512. At step 514, it is determined whether the model requires updating. If so, the model is updated at step 516.",
                        "After validation, the process may proceed to step 518, where the model may be deployed within a system such as that described above with respect to FIG. 4 and used to predict MH risk in diabetes patients. At step 518, MH risk input signals are collected from a subject. At step 520, the MH risk input signals are provided to the trained and validated ML system. At step 522, the ML system produces an MH risk prediction score for the subject, which may be presented to a healthcare provider, stored in a database, or otherwise used to alert or notify a healthcare provider of the subject's MH risk. In one embodiment, if the MH risk score exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., a confidence score above 0.5), the system may send an electronic message to a healthcare provider alerting them of the subject's MH risk.",
                        "In one embodiment, the ML model consists of an ensemble of constituent models trained on random subsets of the training data. Each model may be tuned using any suitable method, such as automated hyperparameter tuning using the hyperopt Python library with 5-fold cross-validation on the training set. The outputs of each of the constituent models may be averaged to obtain a single MH risk score.",
