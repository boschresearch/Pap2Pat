In some embodiments, the result of the analysis are rendered 350, e.g., into a memory, on a display device, or submitted to another application. Examples of the applications include, but not limited to an automatic drilling machine control, automotive car seat occupation detection system, robotic arm/hand sensing, bio-sensing, factory automation, and security applications.",

The processors determine if an object is in proximity to the resonant structure by comparing 410 the phase of the two reflected signals with the reference value of the phases of the original first and the second signals. The processor determines 430 if any of the first or the second change is present.
