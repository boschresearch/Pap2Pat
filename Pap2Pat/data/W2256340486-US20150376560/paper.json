    "title": "<i>In Vitro</i> Engineering of High Modulus Cartilage-Like Constructs",
    "date": "2016-04-01",
    "abstract": "To date, the outcomes of cartilage repair have been inconsistent and have frequently yielded mechanically inferior fibrocartilage, thereby increasing the chances of damage recurrence. Implantation of constructs with biochemical composition and mechanical properties comparable to natural cartilage could be advantageous for long-term repair. This study attempted to create such constructs, in vitro, using tissue engineering principles. Bovine synoviocytes were seeded on nonwoven polyethylene terephthalate fiber scaffolds and cultured in chondrogenic medium for 4 weeks, after which uniaxial compressive loading was applied using an in-house bioreactor for 1 h per day, at a frequency of 1 Hz, for a further 84 days. The initial loading conditions, determined from the mechanical properties of the immature constructs after 4 weeks in chondrogenic culture, were strains ranging between 13% and 23%. After 56 days (sustained at 84 days) of loading, the constructs were stained homogenously with Alcian blue and for type-II collagen. Dynamic compressive moduli were comparable to the high end values for native cartilage and proportional to Alcian blue staining intensity. We suggest that these high moduli values were attributable to the bioreactor setup, which caused the loading regime to change as the constructs developed, that is, the applied stress and strain increased with construct thickness and stiffness, providing continued sufficient cell stimulation as further matrix was deposited. Constructs containing cartilage-like matrix with response to load similar to that of native cartilage could produce long-term effective cartilage repair when implanted.",

                "Cartilage damage can eventually lead to osteoarthritis, causing pain and reduced joint mobility, seriously compromising the affected individual's quality of life.1 It is well recognized that cartilage has a poor capacity for spontaneous self-repair, which is, in part, because of its low cellularity and the lack of vascular and lymphatic systems necessary for efficient healing. In addition, any neotissue that is deposited is likely to be destroyed by the stresses acting within joints during daily activities because it is mechanically weak.2,3 Intervention is required to maintain quality of life. However, so far, surgical treatments for articular cartilage defects have not been consistently effective in preventing the recurrence of damage.1,4",
                "One potential strategy for repairing cartilage is the implantation of cartilage constructs, produced in vitro, that have matrix composition and mechanical properties similar to those of the surrounding native cartilage. The principles of tissue engineering would be followed in creating such cartilage constructs, where appropriate mechanical stimulation would be applied onto cells seeded onto a suitable 3D scaffold to promote a chondrocyte-like phenotype and matrix. It is well documented that biochemical stimulation is a prerequisite for successful differentiation/redifferentiation of cells and desired tissue deposition.5 Mechanical stimulation is also a highly influential factor in the formation of tissue, especially musculoskeletal tissue.6 In order for mechanical loading to elicit a desired mechanotransductive effect on a cartilage-like construct, the following criteria need to be met: (1)\u2002The scaffold should be sufficiently compliant and populated by viable cells with a chondrocyte-like phenotype7\u201310 and surrounded by a cartilage-like matrix such that when loaded, the scaffold will deform and the applied force will be transmitted through the matrix to the cells, and transduced into the cells through appropriate integrins.11\u201313(2)\u2002The values of compressive strain applied onto the constructs should be within the physiological range, which maintain the native tissue's functional properties and are, therefore, likely to induce the desired anabolic effects.14,15 In vitro cyclic compressive loading regimes shown to elicit beneficial chondroinductive effects on tissue-engineered constructs have applied cyclic strains between 5% and 15% at frequencies of, or near, 1\u2009Hz.9,16\u201325",
                "However, the application of compressive loading to engineered constructs in vitro has had limited success in creating mechanically functional constructs that are suitable to implant. This could be because these constructs had moduli that were significantly lower than those of the surrounding native cartilage, they would deform by a greater amount postimplantation, generating excessive shear at the construct\u2013tissue interface impeding integration. In addition, such constructs may be unable to withstand the combination of high compressive and shear stresses arising in the joint. If constructs with mechanical properties comparable to those of the surrounding native cartilage were to be implanted, they are more likely to survive the rigors of the mechanical environment within the joint, integrate with the surrounding native cartilage, and produce long-term repair.26",
                "In previous studies, the values of strain (mechanical stimulus) applied onto constructs have been apparently justified solely by their falling within physiological values.9,20\u201322 However, immature constructs have different matrix composition (e.g., much looser structure) and consequently much lower moduli than those of native cartilage. Hence, to produce adequate mechanical stimulus to the cells resident within the constructs, it is likely that applied strain will be greater for these immature constructs than for native cartilage. We hypothesized that determining the response to load of (immature) precultured constructs would help determine a strain that will provide effective mechanical stimulation to the residing cells within the construct. This would then lead to the formation of cartilage-like constructs with biochemical composition and high-compressive moduli similar to those of native cartilage, and so be mechanically functional.",
                "The objectives of this study were, therefore, to (1) determine appropriate parameters for mechanical stimulation, namely the range of strains to be applied on the constructs; (2) develop a method for implementing the desired mechanical stimulation; (3) compare the compressive properties of the constructs that were subjected to this mechanical stimulus with those of nonloaded controls and native cartilage; and (4) potentially identify any histological characteristics of the constructs that might be associated with their compressive properties."

Each synovial sample was cut into small pieces and digested in 0.25% (w/v) collagenase 1A (Sigma Aldrich, Gillingham, United Kingdom; C9891) within Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium (DMEM/F12) (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom; 21041) at 37\u00b0C for 3\u2009h.

These were comprised of nonwoven 20\u2009\u03bcm diameter filaments that had been plasma treated (Xiros Ltd., Leeds, United Kingdom).31 Scaffolds had an overall porosity of 90.2% by volume and were in the form of disks of 5\u2009mm diameter and 0.9\u2009mm thickness. A 250,000 cells/mL suspension was prepared and 1\u2009mL of cell suspension was combined with one PET scaffold and placed within a 2\u2009mL capacity polypropylene tube. Each tube was then inserted into an in-house built, dynamic cell-seeding apparatus in which these tubes were rotated at a rate of approximately 0.25\u2009Hz. The dynamic cell-seeding apparatus was placed into an incubator at 37\u00b0C for 24\u2009h to allow cells to attach to the PET scaffold.

                        "To identify a suitable loading regime to apply onto the immature constructs, their mechanical response to load needed to be ascertained. After 4 weeks in chondrogenic culture, 13 constructs were each subjected to 20% cyclic strain, at a frequency of 1\u2009Hz, within a dynamic universal testing machine (ElectroPuls E3000, Instron), and the corresponding load was recorded. A representative example of the data is shown in Figure 2. The data showed that the loads recorded at strains of less than 10% were almost negligible and consequently little stress was being transmitted to the matrix and its resident cells. However, at strains greater than approximately 13%, the measured load increased exponentially, indicating the potential for stress to be transmitted to the matrix and residing cells, which was hoped would be adequate to elicit the desired mechanotransductive effects. This strain value of 13% was, therefore, selected as the minimum strain to be applied to the immature constructs. An upper limit of 30% strain was chosen. This value tended toward the higher limit of strains observed in native cartilage, but we assumed that the loose matrix populating the construct was not likely to transmit damaging forces to the cells.",
                        "Application of the selected strain range was achieved using an in-house built compressive bioreactor. The bioreactor was driven by a 12 volt DC motor connected to an assembly comprising a gear box, timing belt, and pulley system, which caused 12 individual plungers to reciprocate vertically at a frequency of 1\u2009Hz. The bioreactor was force controlled. The force delivered by each plunger (which was 7\u2009mm in diameter) comprised the weight of the plunger assembly and the load exerted by a precompressed spring. Each construct was cultured in a separate well of a custom chamber, comprising six wells, made of (316) stainless steel, as shown in Figure 3. A flexible polyurethane film (OpSite Flexigrid, Smith & Nephew, Hull, United Kingdom; 4631) sealed the rim of each well. The plunger penetrated the film, which also sealed the exit of the plunger but did not constrain the plunger's vertical movement. The film allowed for gaseous exchange while maintaining sterility of the culture wells.",
                        "The following setup was adapted to apply mechanical loading in a quasistrain controlled modality. The plunger displacement was limited by surrounding each construct with a silicone ring of 1\u2009mm in thickness and compressive modulus of 2.64\u2009MPa (produced from Sylgard 184 elastomer, VWR International; Lutterworth, United Kingdom; 634165S), as shown in Figure 3. The silicone ring had substantially greater stiffness than the constructs after their 4-week incubation in chondrogenic culture. The effect of the constructs on the plunger displacement was assumed to be negligible when the bioreactor applied a relatively high force of 5\u2009N. Hence, the initial plunger displacement could be determined from (1) the force applied by the bioreactor plunger, (2) the stiffness of the silicone ring, and (3) the contact surface areas of the plunger with the silicone ring and construct. Construct strain was, therefore, dependent on plunger displacement and construct thickness.",
                        "To achieve the desired strain, constructs of thicknesses between 1110 and 1250\u2009\u03bcm were selected. Thickness measurement at this stage of experimentation was achieved using sterile Vernier callipers having an accuracy of 10\u2009\u03bcm. This corresponded to a strain between 13% and 23%. Thirty five per cent of the constructs was discarded, because their thicknesses did not fall within the desired range after 4 weeks in static chondrogenic culture.",

This was attempted by first seeding bovine synoviocytes onto synthetic nonwoven PET scaffolds and culturing in a chondrogenic medium for 4 weeks. The resulting immature constructs were then subjected to cyclic compressive loading, for periods lasting 28, 56, or 84 days. The initial loading parameters were determined from the immature constructs' response to load, which indicated that cyclic strains of amplitude between 13% and 30% could produce suitable stress within the deposited matrix and residing cells, and trigger desired anabolic mechanotransductive effects. Compressive loading was achieved using a force-controlled bioreactor and silicone rings that surrounded each construct, thereby delivering the desired strain.",
                "Within 28 days of applying compression, an increase in cell proliferation was observed, evidenced by a statistically significant increase in DNA content that was absent in nonloaded controls. The DNA content remained at an elevated level throughout the remaining culture period (total 84 days). By day 56 of applying compression, there was a substantial increase in the compressive moduli in the constructs in comparison with those observed at day 28 and in comparison with those in the nonloaded (control) constructs. This occurred in conjunction with the histological findings of intense, homogeneous Alcian blue staining and type II collagen immuno-positive staining, with low immuno-positive staining for type I collagen throughout the loaded constructs. The results indicate an effect of the applied mechanical stimulus on the resident cells within the constructs, whereby these cells have deposited extracellular matrix (ECM) that has characteristics similar to that of native cartilage. Furthermore, the modulus of the constructs reached values that were at the higher end of the range of modulus values of native cartilage.",
                "The effects of compressive loading on tissue-engineered cartilage constructs have been previously reported and are similar in nature to the results within this study, whereby mechanical stimulus resulted in cellular differentiation and deposition of ECM, which increased the modulus of the constructs.9,16\u201325 Indeed, the response of native cartilage to mechanical stimulus is well known, and the regional variations in the compressive modulus of native cartilage have been shown to correlate with the corresponding variations in the predominating regional stress.14,40,41",
                "Numerous publications have reported an increase in cell proliferation attributed to mechanical stimulation during 3D culture of chondrocytes.42\u201345 Different pathways have been implicated in such a response, involving stretch-activated sodium ion channels44 and integrins (specifically \u03b11\u03b25).43 Significantly, these studies suggested that proliferation caused by mechanical stimulation occurs primarily in immature chondrocytes44 and second when the cells are in a \u201creceptive\u201d phenotype (e.g., after treatment with TGF-\u03b23).43 The observation that cell proliferation occurs in immature chondrocytes implies that proliferation is a natural stage in the formation of new cartilage tissue.44 This suggests that the synoviocytes used in this study had differentiated to an immature chondrocyte-like phenotype after the 4 weeks of chondro-induction and upon commencement of mechanical loading.",
                "From days 0 to 28 of mechanical loading, there was a statistically significant drop in protein content for both loaded and nonloaded constructs, whereas both experimental groups displayed a significant increase in staining for cartilage matrix. This unexpected phenomenon could, therefore, be attributed to the continued action of the chondrogenic medium, which caused the noncartilage-like matrix to undergo significant turnover toward a cartilage-like matrix with an overall net drop in protein content.",
                "The moduli of constructs produced in this study were substantially greater than any previously published values for in vitro-produced cartilage constructs, to our best knowledge. This is the first time in which a means is shown to form cartilage constructs with dynamic mechanical properties that compare with the higher range of native articular cartilage. In addition, the compressive modulus was strongly correlated with the mean intensity of Alcian blue staining in the construct sections, suggesting that it is the accumulation of suitable ECM (i.e., glycosaminoglycans) within the constructs that is associated with the mechanical properties. Although the engineered tissue is similar to native cartilage in its mechanical and matrix staining properties, we refer to it as cartilage-like because it did not exhibit the zonal variations observed in native cartilage, in particular, the presence of a calcified zone.",
                "One aspect that may contribute to the high moduli reached in this study could lie in the scaffold used here in comparison to those used previously by others, that is, hydrogel versus nonwoven filaments. As hydrogels encapsulate cells, matrix is deposited around the periphery of the cell and, therefore, matrix initially forms in pockets with respect to the overall construct.9,18 Nonwoven fiber scaffolds have greater voids for the deposited matrix to fill (in this case 90.2% space void of material) and so matrix was observed throughout the scaffold. Uniformity of deposited matrix (such as that we have reported here) means that overall applied strain will directly relate to matrix strain, rather than scaffold strain. A nonwoven fiber scaffold will also enhance cell\u2013cell communication over an encapsulating scaffold, which has been implicated in partially controlling differentiation toward a chondrogenic phenotype.46,47",
                "The site-specific distribution of the matrix components might also be expected to contribute toward construct moduli, although this was not investigated in detail in this study. Huang et al. (2010) found that although application of compressive loading to constructs improved mechanical properties, these improvements were attributed to a change in matrix distribution and not to changes in matrix quantity.10 In addition, by computer simulation, Nagel and Kelly (2012) were able to predict experimental observations of constructs improving their mechanical properties after compression by structural changes in the collagen network.48 However, an explanation as to why the constructs in our study reached high-moduli values could be related to the nature of the mechanical regime as the constructs matured."

The following developments were observed: (1)\u2002The thickness of the loaded constructs significantly reduced from day 0 (that is after 4 weeks of preculture) to day 28, after which it steadily increased for the remaining culture period up to day 84. The estimated applied strain followed a similar trend.(2)\u2002The modulus of the constructs increased in step as mentioned (as shown in Table 2 and Fig. 9). Because the compressive stiffness of the constructs was gradually becoming more comparable with that of the surrounding silicone ring (and indeed eventually increased beyond it), the constructs would be compressed with progressively increasing load as they took a greater proportion of the load delivered by the plunger of the bioreactor.",
                        "It appears that upon mechanical loading (for 1\u2009h per day, 5 days per week), there is initial compaction of the constructs, causing an observed decrease in thickness. Then during the periods of rest, the cells respond to mechanical loading by synthesizing and depositing cartilage-like matrix that progressively fills the voids within the scaffold, thereby increasing its stiffness and thickness. As a direct result, the stress and strain applied to the constructs by the bioreactor increase accordingly during the following periods of loading. This iterative process of increasing mechanical stimulation could be a significant contributing factor in creating cartilage-like constructs with compressive moduli that are comparable to the higher range of native articular cartilage values.",
                        "Based on our combined data, we suggest that when mechanical loading is initiated, the loading regime triggers a surge in cellular proliferation and a compaction of the constructs. After deposition of an appropriate quantity of cartilage-like matrix (primarily as a result of continuous exposure to TGF-\u03b23), the residing cells react to the challenge of mechanical loading by upregulating the cartilage-like ECM net synthesis and secretion in an attempt to \u201cresist\u201d the applied load. As the cells continue to lay down cartilage-like matrix, the ECM will spread (and would be expected to transmit) the load away from the cells, reducing their stimulation. However, because of the bioreactor setup, as the constructs' stiffness and thickness increase, the stress and strain applied onto the constructs also increase, thereby maintaining cellular mechanical stimulation, inducing continued anabolic effects. This would continue until the majority of the load applied from the bioreactor is taken by the constructs and not by the surrounding silicone ring. At this point, the mechanical loading to the constructs will have reached a plateau and will act to simply maintain tissue composition akin to the homeostasis of native articular cartilage.14 This hypothesis is summarized in Figure 16.",
                        "Using an increasing magnitude of applied load over time to promote matrix deposition has not been reported previously in the literature. However, a study by Khoshgoftar et al. (2013), using finite element analysis, suggested that an increase in applied load would be required to maintain cellular loading as pericellular matrix increased,49 supporting the experimental evidence within this study.",
                        "The initial strategy of selecting a loading regime based on the mechanical properties of precultured constructs was seemingly an important step in creating the initial baseline mechanical culture conditions, by furthering the differentiation of the residing cells as evidenced by triggered proliferation. However, the data suggest that the presence of a self-increasing loading regime (that is driven by the maturation of the developing constructs themselves) appears to have been a key feature, and most significant finding of this study, to produce cartilage-like constructs with high moduli.",
                        "The rate at which each construct progressed along the overall growth trajectory appeared to be individual. Despite starting with the same conditions (scaffold, seeding density, and chondrogenic medium), variations in construct thickness and stiffness were first measured after 4 weeks in the chondrogenic culture and there was clear variation at later time points, with or without the presence of mechanical loading. A self-adapting mechanism proposed here, delivered by a multichannel bioreactor (with one construct per loading station), would be advantageous to the seemingly inherent variability of tissue-engineered, biological samples. The majority of bioreactors, to date, have used one loading mechanism to apply load to multiple constructs9,17,20,22\u201324,50,51 and, therefore, may not deliver optimum stimulation to each individual sample during its growth. The choice of scaffold (nonwoven filamentous, rather than hydrogel), the use of a multichannel bioreactor, and the self-regulating mechanical loading regime appear to be the significant aspects of this study to form constructs with high stiffness and cartilage-like appearance over previous studies.",
                        "It remains unknown to what exact construct properties are required to elicit repair. In a recent study by Fisher et al. (2014),52 they suggest that the most suitable time to implant a construct should be based not only on the mechanical and biochemical properties at a given time point, but also on the time in which the highest rate of change is occurring (with regard to increase in cartilage components and mechanical properties). This was based on a static in vitro integration experiment. This would suggest that implantation should occur when the mechanical properties are sufficient to survive and transmit load within the joint, and when the residing cells are at their most active. This would appear to expedite the formation of new cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix interactions plus increased matrix turnover, which improves the rate and chances of integration to occur. Fisher et al. are currently investigating this strategy with in vivo experiments and this strategy could be applied to the constructs in this study.",
                        "Although high-compressive moduli values were achieved in this study, there remains scope for further optimization to improve the rate of quality matrix deposition and further understanding of the mechanical cues (such as tension and shear triggered by uniaxial compression), to which the residing cells and matrix could be subjected to. Nevertheless, we have illustrated that a self-regulating system, which increases the applied stress and strain as the constructs' stiffness and thickness increase, has the potential to produce constructs with moduli values equal to those of native cartilage, raising the possibility of improved clinical outcomes when such constructs are used as a direct tissue replacement. Such a construct could be produced from autologous cells, or alternatively decellularized to create an \u201coff the shelf\u201d replacement tissue."

The applied regime initially caused a surge in cell proliferation and continued cartilage-like matrix deposition from static chondrogenic culture. We hypothesize that what followed was a self-regulating mechanical regime that increased the applied stress and strain in conjunction with the maturing constructs' stiffness and thickness, which was generated by the bioreactor setup. These two processes initialized and maintained significant mechanical cell stimulation to form cartilage-like constructs with both histological appearance and high compressive moduli comparable to those of native cartilage, far greater than nonloaded controls and other cartilage constructs described in the literature. Hence, the constructs could be mechanically functional as a direct tissue replacement for cartilage repair."
