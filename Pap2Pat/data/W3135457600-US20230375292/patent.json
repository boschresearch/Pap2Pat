                        "Turning now to the drawings, systems and methods in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention can provide a method for smart boiling. In a variety of embodiments, systems can include a data-driven learning framework that correlates high-quality imaging on dynamic bubbles with associated boiling curves. The framework can leverage cutting-edge deep learning models including (but not limited to) convolutional neural networks and object detection algorithms to automatically extract both hierarchical and physics-based features. By training on these features, models in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can learn physical boiling laws that statistically describe the manner in which bubbles nucleate, coalesce, and depart under boiling conditions, enabling in situ boiling curve prediction with a mean error of 6%. Frameworks in accordance with several embodiments of the invention can offer an automated, learning-based, alternative to conventional boiling heat transfer metrology.",
                        "In a variety of embodiments, the method can include receiving a set of one or more bubble images from a boiling system, identifying bubble characteristics from the set of bubble images, identifying a set of image features from the set of bubble images, predicting a set of boiling heat characteristics based on the identified bubble characteristics and the set of image features, and controlling the boiling system based on the predicted set of boiling heat characteristics.",
                        "Controlling boiling systems in accordance with numerous embodiments of the invention can modulate flowrates through pump control panels remotely accessed by the computer that processes visualization data. In a variety of embodiments, smart boiling models can be trained to find the optimum flowrate based on different combinations of heat flux, surface temperature, and pressure drops. The model can be trained to predict the optimal flowrate based on provided image data.",
                        "As the heat generation at the device footprint continuously increases in modern high-power density systems, boiling heat transfer surfaces as an excellent remedy to many thermal management issues. Flow boiling can be a powerful strategy to remove massive thermal loads from a boiling surface but suffers from large bubble-induced pressure drops that can severely damage the system. The traditional workflow of flow boiling studies was to use passive control of flow boiling conditions with limited data analysis (e.g., surface, flow rate, working fluid). The passively optimized, boiling surfaces or boiling conditions are not suitable for electric systems where hotspot blueprints keep changing actively. While there has been increasing interest and demand for innovative flow boiling strategies, it has been difficult to actively control the flow boiling with synchronized image analysis due to the intrinsic complexity of boiling physics associated with bubble dynamics. While deep learning frameworks have surfaced as a new alternative to characterize boiling heat transfer, no system has yet been able to fully connect image data with boiling physics by using machine learning based systems in relation to electric input signals.",
                        "One of the many advantages of implementing smart flow boiling in accordance with many embodiments of the invention is its resource-effectiveness. Active controlling of flowrates for liquid cooling promotes efficient use of energy, which can substantially reduce costs and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and other air pollution emitted as a result. In addition to the energy-efficiency, the learning framework through the image automation significantly will be faster and save time for researchers to analyze large datasets by synchronizing image data with the measured values.",
                        "Systems in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can enable computer vision assisted data analysis for the active control of boiling conditions. The computer vision assisted, in situ data analysis in accordance with some embodiments of the invention can quantify boiling characteristics through a visualization-based learning framework. Boiling frameworks in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention can correlate high-quality bubble images with boiling conditions (e.g., associated heat flux, temperature, and pressure profiles). In many embodiments, boiling frameworks can automatically leverage cutting-edge convolutional neural networks and object detection algorithms to automatically extract both hierarchical image- and physics-based features. By training on these features, boiling models in accordance with a variety of embodiments of the invention can learn physical boiling laws that statistically describe the manner in which bubbles nucleate, coalesce, and depart under boiling conditions, enabling in situ smart control of boiling conditions by reducing maximum junction temperature and pressure requirements.",
                        "In a variety of embodiments, systems can provide active and smart control of boiling conditions in a flow boiling setup by acquiring high-fidelity images. Active control in accordance with a variety of embodiments of the invention can be performed through automated real-time analysis of high-quality bubble images via trained deep learning models. Active control models in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can be trained to predict updated flowrate values which can balance heat flux, surface temperature, and/or pressure drops within the system. In numerous embodiments, appropriate flowrates can automatically be applied to the system (e.g., through a pump control panel). The techniques are applicable to any type of flow boiling system with minimum modifications to the original system and requires no additional cost.",

Process 100 receives (105) a set of bubble images. Process 100 identifies (110) a set of bubble characteristics from the set of bubble images.

Process 100 predicts (120) a set of boiling heat characteristics based on the identified set of bubble characteristics and the identified set of image features. Process 100 controls (125) the flow boiling system based on the predicted set of boiling heat characteristics.",
                        "While specific processes for controlling flow boiling systems are described above, any of a variety of processes can be utilized to control flow boiling systems as appropriate to the requirements of specific applications. In certain embodiments, steps may be executed or performed in any order or sequence not limited to the order and sequence shown and described. In a number of embodiments, some of the above steps may be executed or performed substantially simultaneously where appropriate or in parallel to reduce latency and processing times. In some embodiments, one or more of the above steps may be omitted.",
                        "Boiling is a heat transfer mechanism that utilizes liquid-to-vapor phase transition to dissipate great amounts of heat with minimal temperature difference. Since boiling enables a system to maintain fairly constant surface temperatures during large thermal energy fluctuations, many modern high power density systems such as power plants, power electronics, laser diodes, and photovoltaics rely on boiling for thermal management. The energy per unit area (i.e., heat flux) measures how much thermal energy is relieved via boiling and is a critical factor in characterizing boiling heat transfer. For instance, the efficacy of boiling heat transfer can be quantified by either the improvements in the critical heat flux (CHF) and/or heat transfer coefficient (HTC), both of which are functions of the boiling heat curves. With the goal of increasing the CHF limit and HTC, prior works have investigated the effects of flow condition, surface treatment and design, and bubble morphology on boiling curves. These past findings suggest that inherent structural characteristics as well as intrinsic material properties can significantly affect boiling performance, and therefore the boiling curve.",
                        "Quantification of boiling curves has been studied in many theoretical, numerical, or experimental works. Theoretical research on boiling mechanisms provided the foundations for heat flux estimation. However, the intrinsic complexity of the dynamic boiling phenomena has limited those theoretical studies to very simplified models. With numerical simulations, single to multi-bubble physics are investigated for detailed characterization of heat flux. Although direct numerical simulation of the boiling process enables studying dissipated heat flux at local and global scales, the accuracy of these simulations is debatable. Therefore, researchers still heavily rely on experiments to measure the boiling heat flux via, e.g., thermocouples, electrical power input, or infrared (IR) techniques. However, these experimental methods are inefficiently connected with visual information, which can be a huge downfall for providing a clear description of dynamic boiling physics.",
                        "Smart boiling systems and methods in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can provide a bridge between measurements and visual information to relate surface design inputs (e.g., surface morphology, material type, and/or surface chemistry) and boiling statistics (e.g., bubble size, count, shape, trajectory, velocity vectors, and bubble-bubble interactions) with boiling curves (e.g., CHF and HTC). Despite the significance of gathering essential visual information, current measurement setups fail to synchronically analyze image data without extensive user involvement, which is not only time-consuming, but can also introduce user bias. In various embodiments, systems and methods can include a non-destructive and automated optical method that can provide in situ heat flux quantification during boiling.",
                        "Current advances in deep learning and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled automatic and scalable image analysis for, e.g., object detection, classification, and even image-based predictions. Many CNN-based deep learning frameworks are effective because CNNs emulate the human brain's natural visual perception mechanism by systematically learning features through multiple operational layers. Image-based deep learning models in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can play a vital role in fully understanding boiling physics because boiling images may be richly embedded with bubble statistics (e.g., bubble size, count, trajectory, and velocity vectors), which are quantitative measurements of the dynamic boiling phenomena. Despite the potential for understanding image-based boiling physics via deep learning frameworks, very few attempts have been made to build them. Recent works have developed a framework to classify boiling regimes and to quantify boiling heat transfer. However, the boiling experiments in these studies are conducted on one-dimensional (1D) wires, which cannot represent the complex and volatile bubble motions associated with realistic two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) surfaces. Many past models were unable to evade the notorious title of being indiscernible black boxes that predict outputs with given input parameters, without providing any description about the related physics. In addition to this, there have been no such an effort to practice machine learning based computer vision link bubble dynamics and boiling processes.",
                        "Systems in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can provide a data-driven boiling analysis framework that can predict boiling heat flux based on high-quality bubble images in real-time (FIG. 2). Boiling analysis frameworks in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can conceptualize state-of-the-art CNNs and object detection algorithms to automatically extract hierarchical image features as well as physics-based bubble statistics to learn inherent boiling physics. By training on these features, frameworks can not only describe the manner in which the bubbles nucleate and depart under boiling conditions, but also predict the boiling curves with a mean error of 6% using a small dataset. Boiling analysis frameworks can provide quantitative descriptions of underlying boiling activities that can potentially help discover unknown boiling laws.",

The proposed framework in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can learn from a hierarchy of image features as well as boiling physics with the aim of predicting real-time boiling heat flux. In a variety of embodiments, frameworks in accordance with numerous embodiments of the invention can learn from a hierarchy of image features as well as boiling physics with the aim of predicting the optimum flowrate required to optimize the boiling conditions.",

In FIG. 3a, all pool boiling experiments are conducted on a pool boiling rig with fixed thermal attachment, consistent imaging distance, and an identical plain copper substrate. FIG. 3b shows temporal bubble images captured from the high-speed camera confirm that it is challenging to differentiate bubble changes with small heat flux steps. FIG. 3c shows that the changes in bubble appearance become more noticeable when heat flux steps are relatively large."

                                "Boiling analysis frameworks in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract hierarchical image features (see FIG. 3a and Methods for data acquisition). Primitive features such as edges and corners are at the lower levels of this hierarchy, whereas more abstract features (e.g., the existence of a bubble) are at the higher levels. Using these hierarchical features, CNN models can recognize small and critical details in images that the human eye may not perceive. While it has been challenging to differentiate bubble images between relatively small boiling heat flux steps (<20 W/cm2) (FIG. 3b), the CNN's recognition capability makes this task possible. In contrast to the images within similar heat flux ranges, the bubble images display quite distinguishable changes across relatively large heat flux steps (>20 W/cm2) (FIG. 3c), which has been the ranges investigated and analyzed in conventional boiling studies. In some embodiments, deep CNNs can be employed because they can learn more efficiently than shallow CNNs by naturally integrating incredibly enrichened image features. A representative robust and easily-trainable deep CNN architecture, VGG16, is selected for this study. Regardless of the high performance of VGG16, the complex and spontaneous nature of the boiling bubble dynamics could still require thousands of images per class to learn from the scratch, leading to a substantial cost of data analysis. In several embodiments, a transfer learning technique, called fine-tuning, can be performed to retrain a pre-trained CNN network on a specific task (e.g., bubble image recognition (see Supplementary Information, FIG. 7)."

                                "In numerous embodiments, boiling analysis frameworks can employ advanced object detection algorithms to extract pre-determined features (i.e., bubble statistics) that provide clear physical meaning from a group of images. The relationship between bubble statistics (e.g., bubble size and count) and heat flux is well-described in previous studies; higher heat flux increases the wall superheat, thereby facilitating bubble growth and coalescence. Image-based deep learning models can play a vital role in fully understanding boiling physics because boiling images are richly embedded with bubble statistics, which are quantitative measurements of the dynamic boiling phenomena. However, manual extraction of such detailed information from thousands of images is laborious and time-consuming. To automate image analysis, processes in accordance with a number of embodiments of the invention can utilize instance segmentation models (e.g., Mask R-CNN) to automatically detect and record bubble statistics by measuring individual bubbles in each time frame. See Methods Section for Mask R-CNN training process. FIG. 4 displays bubble parameters obtained from a Mask R-CNN data analysis as a function of boiling heat flux. As the boiling continues with incremental increases of the power, the number of bubbles coalescence events increases, displaying a linear correlation between the bubble size and boiling heat flux in FIG. 4a. The inset shows that the bubbles sizes are originally extracted as pixel values. The pixel values are converted to mm2 bubble sizes using a commercial program ImageJ and then averaged over the corresponding heat flux.",
                                "The error bars in FIG. 4a represent the bubble size deviation, which also linearly correlates with the boiling heat flux in FIG. 4b. Low heat fluxes have small standard deviations, which means bubbles sizes are relatively uniform. As heat flux increases, the difference becomes small and large bubbles become increasingly noticeable and is reflected in the plot. The bubble size differences for low and high heat fluxes are illustrated in the inset. The linear increase in bubble size deviation describes the presence of both small and large bubbles in the same image frame at high heat fluxes. It is evident that vigorous bubble coalescing events expedite bubble growth and continuous bubble genesis on heated surfaces.",
                                "In contrast to the linear increase in bubble size, the average bubble count exponentially decreases as heat flux increases in FIG. 4c, due to the active bubble coalescence events. The inset portrays individual bubbles that are identified and counted. The measurements are performed on the train and validation datasets, as described in the Methods Section. The good agreement between those datasets in FIGS. 4a-c implies that the bubble statistics are repeatable and thus suitable to predict the boiling curves. By selecting the optimal combination of heat flux, surface temperature, and pressure, models in accordance with several embodiments of the invention can be trained to predict the flowrate outcome by viewing images in real-time.",
                                "In certain embodiments, bubble statistics can then be processed through multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks, where feature weights can be adjusted to learn boiling physics. In many embodiments, MLP networks can be implemented because, unlike CNNs, segmentation models may only extract features and therefore may need an additional network to train them. MLP neural networks in accordance with a variety of embodiments of the invention can use a group of images (e.g., collected over a few seconds) per each heat flux step as the input, whereas individual images per each heat flux step can be processed through CNNs. In various embodiments, aggregated bubble statistics (e.g., bubble size, count, shape, trajectory, velocity vectors, and bubble-bubble interactions) can be incorporated in the CNN's prediction in a hybrid format, to improve the prediction accuracy. Since prediction models are predominantly built around the MLP network, the compiled Mask R-CNN and MLP neural network model may be denoted as the MLP model throughout this description.",

As described in FIG. 8 in detail, the coupling process of CNNs and MLPs can reinforce the model by complementing unique learning strategies of each method; the CNN is capable of recognizing subtle visual alterations (e.g., light diffractions and bubble patterns) without learning the reason why they deviate from original values; whereas the MLP neural network recognizes how bubbles should behave in relation to boiling laws without learning any significant visual variations. FIG. 5 illustrates an example of how datasets are processed in the HyPR model. Images from the high-speed measurements can be distributed into train, test, and validation datasets where only the train datasets are applied with data augmentation for dataset diversification. The augmented images are then simultaneously fed through VGG16 CNN and Mask R-CNN networks where image features and bubble statistics can be extracted, respectively. It should be noted that the Mask R-CNN model can already be pre-trained to automatically detect and segment bubble images. The bubble statistics exported from Mask R-CNN can be additionally processed through MLP neural networks before being concatenated with the CNN outputs. In numerous embodiments, the outputs through the coupled CNN and MLP networks are then fully connected and applied with a linear activation function, which enables the HyPR model to predict continuous heat flux values. The HyPR model in accordance with numerous embodiments of the invention can be fine-tuned (e.g., on ImageNet) and saved to be assessed with the validation dataset."

For the CNN model, the test loss is relatively lower than the train loss and display more noise compared to the other models. The high train loss with respect to test loss is attributed to data augmentation being applied only on the train dataset, making test dataset images easier to predict. On the other hand, the hybrid model shows much smoother decay than CNN models, verifying the effectiveness of using combined features. The testing loss for the HyPR, CNN, and MLP models are 2.4, 7.1, and 5.3, respectively.

During the boiling experiments, the power input for the validation dataset is spontaneously increased or decreased for five heat flux steps (S1-5). Between steady states, transitional states (T1-4) are also measured to confirm the models' ability to identify real-time boiling heat flux changes. In FIG. 5d, the prediction values of HyPR, CNN, and MLP models are indicated by using green, yellow, and blue markers, respectively, and the thermocouple measurements are shown in black circles. While all three models predict the general increasing- or decreasing-trend of the new dataset, the CNN model deviates the most from thermocouple measurements and overpredicts mid-range boiling heat fluxes, which are 50-80 W/cm2. The error bars in FIG. 6d indicate the standard deviations of heat flux measurements and model predictions. The errors from thermocouple measurements are translated to real-time heat flux changes during transitional steps and measurement uncertainties. The errors from the model predictions represent prediction fluctuations caused by the model making predictions for individual images. The prediction fluctuations of HyPR model are greatly minimized to near nullity, supporting the hypothesis that the bubble statistics features function as prediction guidelines for the hierarchical image feature-based predictions. It should be noted that the prediction fluctuations are relatively high for the CNN models because they operate on an individual image-basis.

The error bars show the standard deviation of MAPE over all heat flux steps. The HyPR model exhibits relatively smaller deviations than the MLP model while both models exhibit similar MAPE. This suggests that the use of hierarchical image features in the HyPR model positively impacts the prediction capability of the hybrid model. Generally, MAPE is known to decrease as the training dataset size increases at the expense of increased training cost. Despite the advantages of using a large image dataset, the model was intentionally trained on a small (250 image per class) dataset while achieving similar MAPEs compared to the recent work with 91% dataset size reduction47, which confirms that the collective effectiveness of coupling multiple learning techniques (e.g., CNN, Mask R-CNN, MLP, fine-tuning, data augmentation, etc.) performs well. It should be noted that the increases in the dataset size can further improve the MAPE by providing extra learnable image and bubble statistic features with additional computational cost."

                        "A great advantage of using deep learning techniques is their flexibility to be upgraded to improve in any possible directions by adjusting tasks or leveraging new algorithms. For instance, boiling curves are often correlated with surface structures, which makes the framework suitable for detecting potential surface changes during boiling conditions. Nanotextured surfaces are known to have more bubble nucleation sites than plain surfaces, which can cause excessive bubble coalescence and eventuate in premature CHF. The previous findings show a good agreement with preliminary boiling curve measurements of plain and nanotextured surfaces in FIG. 9 where the nanotextured surface showcases larger average bubble size as well as lower bubble count at similar heat fluxes. The different signals between plain and nanotextured surfaces are clear such that they can help differentiate the surface types in detail or identify the surface deterioration. As with the capability to characterize different surfaces through an agglomeration of spatial bubble statistics, models in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention can be used to study spatiotemporal evolutions of predetermined features (e.g., bubble size, count, shape, trajectory, velocity vectors, and bubble-bubble interactions) by implementing tracking algorithms.",
                        "Perhaps more importantly, the use of deep learning framework can be resource effective, in experimental and computational manners. For instance, visualization-based methods can be remote, so that the measurements can be conducted over multiple boiling setups with minimum space requirements. Furthermore, processes in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can be cost-effective. Conventional methods using thermocouple and electrical power input setups require wired attachments (i.e., probes and multimeters) while IR cameras need dichroic mirror fixture stages and can only conduct bottom-to-top imaging. In many cases, these attachments substantially increase the costs of boiling devices at both lab and commercial scales. In addition to the space and cost considerations, the learning framework through the image automation significantly saves computational time to analyze large-size datasets by synchronizing image data with the measured values. While high-resolution images are extremely memory-expensive, the transfer learning and data augmentation techniques can reduce the required image dataset size and model training time. The resource-effective framework demonstrated here will help describe other types of image-based transport phenomena to impact the heat transfer community."

The pool boiling rig mainly consists of the boiling surface, a heating block, a data acquisition device connected to thermocouples, and a high-speed camera. The boiling surface is a 1 cm\u00d71 cm plain copper sample, which is soldered and left attached on a custom-built copper heating block in all measurements to ensure consistent thermal contact resistance. The boiling surface is cleansed for 5 minutes before each experiment via a piranha solution. The heating block consists of four cylindrical cartridge heaters, which can be heated by AV voltage regulator (Variac Transformer), where an insulating glass wool thoroughly encloses the copper block to promote one-dimensional thermal conduction. The generated heat flux is calculated by taking the average heat flux q\u2033=k\u0394T/L measured from four K-type thermocouples positioned incrementally along the copper heating block where k is the thermal conductivity and \u0394T is the temperature difference measured between a prescribed distance L. The uncertainty of thermocouple measurements is \u00b11\u00b0 C., which leads to an estimated uncertainty of 2.2% at the maximum heat flux by using the law of propagation of uncertainty (see Supplementary Information). The train and test dataset heat fluxes can be measured only during steady states while the validation dataset includes both steady and transitional state measurements to demonstrate real-time prediction. Furthermore, the input heat fluxes in the validation dataset can be arbitrarily raised and lowered to test the model's robustness. A data acquisition device (Labjack U6) records temperatures for approximately 3 minutes during both steady and transitional states. Above the boiling surface, a transparent guard heater-installed boiling chamber maintains degassed DI water in saturation conditions by receiving signals from a PID controller."

                                "Pool boiling images and videos can be obtained via a high-speed camera (FASTCAM Mini AX50). Since high resolution images convey important bubble statistics in relation to the boiling heat flux, the image resolution is set to 1024\u00d71024 pixels in this study. To improve the imaging quality, a light diffuser is placed opposite from the camera to evenly distribute background lighting (FIG. 3a). High speed imaging of 2,000 fps improves the image quality even further by reducing motion blurs. On the other hand, high-speed imaging can produce overly correlated image datasets if captured in high frame sequences. Highly sequential image datasets, in turn, risk being biased towards only a few numbers of bubbles and requires unnecessarily many images to increase the dataset diversity. To minimize potential bias to the identification process caused by highly correlated frame sequences, processes in accordance with various embodiments of the invention can capture images at random time frames (i.e., randomized imaging) for a duration of 30 seconds. The structural similarity index (SSIM) confirms the image dataset correlation by comparing two images, where SSIM=1 corresponds to identical images and SSIM=0 indicates completely uncorrelated images. The SSIM plot in FIG. 10a shows that the randomized imaging dataset display relatively lower SSIM indexes than the sequential imaging dataset. The higher correlation of sequential images becomes clearer in the histogram plot (FIG. 10b), where a greater number of high SSIM indexes are observed. On the other hand, randomized images are well distributed (i.e., less correlated) and form a gaussian curve with a relatively low mean SSIM index of 0.6. Therefore, randomized imaging techniques can be employed to collect 250 images for each heat flux step, which provides the total of 3,250 images to train the model."

The labelling process in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention can be greatly minimized by utilizing data augmentation techniques, which can increase the generalizability of the model by randomly transforming the original data into new, increased, and slightly modified versions (FIG. 12). Augmentations can include (but are not limited to) flipping the image, rotating the image, resizing the image, cropping the image, modifying the brightness of an image, and/or modifying the noise of an image.

In this example, the model is initialized using weights pre-trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO) dataset. Mask R-CNN trains for a total of 100 epochs using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 1e-3 and momentum of 0.9. A checkpoint at each epoch saves the model's state for optimal model selection. The training results in FIG. 11c show that training and test loss both decrease, with a minimum test loss of 0.09 at epoch 98, which has been selected for this study.
