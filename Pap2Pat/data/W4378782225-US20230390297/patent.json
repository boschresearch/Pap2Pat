                        "MLL3 and MLL4, within the Complex of Proteins Associated with Set1 (COMPASS) family, are the major histone H3K4 mono-methyltransferases functioning at enhancers. Their roles in enhancer activity regulation and gene expression rely on both catalytic-dependent functions through H3K4 mono-methylation and catalytic-independent activities via co-function with UTX and p300 for enhancer activation. MLL3 and MLL4 are essential for a variety of developmental processes including mammalian myogenesis and adipogenesis, macrophage activation, cardiac development, and B-cell lymphomagenesis just to mention a few. The distinct requirement for MLL3 and MLL4 during mammalian development is stage dependent: MLL4 is required after implantation, and its action is dosage dependent; MLL3 is essential during late gestation and for organ maturation. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), MLL4 is dispensable for cell identity and self-renewal, but is essential for cells to exit pluripotency state and cell fate transition.",
                        "The emerging roles of chromatin function in developmental diseases and cancers involves the multifaceted and orchestrated interplay between chromatin-modifying enzymes, chromatin regulatory factors, and the regulatory elements on chromatin. The large consortium project, Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC), has identified a large number of somatic mutations in chromatin modifiers that regulate enhancer chromatin across a wide-range of human tumor types. The most frequently mutated factors include H3K4 mono-methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 (KMT2C and KMT2D) and their cofactor H3K27 demethylase UTX (KDM6A) indicating the broad tumor suppressor roles of these proteins. Intriguingly, mutations resulting in loss-of-function on MLL4 and UTX also results in the developmental disorders such as Kabuki syndrome. Despite the extensive characterization of recurrent mutations across different cancer types and developmental disorders, scarce information has been acquired regarding the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of the mutations in these essential genes that regulate enhancer chromatin function. In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to better understand the functional outcomes of these mutations in MLL3/4 and any therapeutic insight it may provide."

                                "To characterize the consequences and phenotypic changes of MLL3/4 loss, we generated an Mll3/4 double knockout mouse ES cell line by deleting exon8-9 of Mll3 and exon 16-22 of Mll4 respectively (FIG. 7A). Successful knockout of Mll3 and Mll4 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies against different regions of MLL3 and MLL4, and subunits unique to MLL3/4 branch of COMPASS (including NCOA6, UTX, and PTIP) (FIG. 7B). To examine the histone modifications and gene expression pattern changes in Mll3/4 KO cells, we performed H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq. K-means clustering (k=2) separated the previous defined M114 peaks (9) into two groups based on the log 2 fold change ChIP-seq signal of H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac (FIG. 7C). Meta-analysis of Group2 revealed that prominent H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac reduction in Mll3/4 KO cells coincided with strongly reduced gene expression of those where MLL4 peaks were found (FIG. 7C). Feature distribution of MLL4 peaks and the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of nearby genes demonstrated similar distribution of MLL4 peaks. These peaks were mostly at enhancer regions in group 1 and group2 defined by K-means clustering and enriched in pathways related to cytoskeleton and junction organization (FIG. 7D, E). Finally, pluripotency markers, including Pou5f1 and Nanog gene expression, remained the same in WT and Mll3/4 KO cells suggesting MLL3/4 are dispensable for self-renewal of the mESCs (FIG. 7F). The cellular growth rates of WT and MLL3/4K0 cells were comparable (FIG. 7G).",
                                "To investigate the cellular vulnerabilities with MLL3/4 depletion, we performed a dropout screen with the Brie CRISPR knockout library in WT and Mll3/4 KO mESCs (FIG. 1A). We took day 3 as initial state and day 15/21 as final state. After scrutinizing normalized read counts and sample clustering (FIG. 8A), the enrichment of sgRNAs in live cells after 15 and 21 days of selection was compared with cells harvested at 3 days of infection without selection (FIG. 1A). The top 300 negatively selected genes in Mll3/4 KO cells, in comparison with wild type cells, were enriched in pathways related to a variety of metabolic processes including \u2018nucleobase-containing small molecule metabolic process\u2019 (FIG. 1B). Specifically, the 12 critical metabolic enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis (16) were all essential at final state as shown in the rank plot based on the negative RRA score (17) (FIG. 1C). To further examine the dependencies of these metabolic genes, the beta score of gene essentiality was calculated for WT and KO cells using MLE algorithm (18). Indeed, all these critical purine and pyrimidine de novo synthesis genes were only essential in KO, but not WT cells, as shown in the scatter plot (FIG. 1D). This was further explored by examining the log 2 fold change of sgRNA enrichment (FIG. 8B). For instance, distribution of normalized sgRNA read counts of Ppat and Mthfd1 were depleted only in Mll3/4 KO cells at final state (day 15 and day 21) (FIG. 1E). Similar trends were also observed with other genes encoding the critical metabolic enzymes for de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis (FIG. 8C). To validate the CRISPR screening results, WT and KO cells were labeled with GFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins and mixed one-to-one ratio for individual sgRNAs infection. Fluorescent signals were captured with flow cytometry during the indicated time course (FIG. 8D). Normalized ratio of mCherry/GFP was calculated for several negatively selected genes in Mll3/4 KO cells (including Yrdc, Strap, Pfas, Zic3, Umps and Slc25a19) suggesting KO cells are preferentially more sensitive to the depletion of these genes by sgRNAs (FIG. 8E). Overall, our CRIPSR screen identified the existence of a de novo nucleotide synthesis dependency alteration when the functions of MLL3 and MLL4 were diminished in mESCs.",
                                "Loss of MLL3 and MLL4 Increases Flux Through Purine Synthesis in mESCs",
                                "Due to the cellular dependency alteration of nucleotide synthesis pathway genes in Mll3/4 KO cells, we performed liquid-chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based steady-state metabolite profiling to globally assess the metabolome of WT and Mll3/4 KO cells (FIG. 9). Among the small molecules detected, the steady-state levels of metabolites involved in methionine metabolism (S-adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cystathionine), urea cycle (argininosuccinate, carbamoyl-phosphate) and nucleotide metabolism (UMP, CMP, AICAR, carbamoyl-phosphate, inosine, adenosine, and hypoxanthine) were significantly altered in MLL3/4-deficient cells compared to wild-type cells (FIG. 9C-E). We note that, at the steady-state levels, information about the dynamic regulation of the metabolic pathways is not complete, and parallel approaches must be employed to reach a conclusion on whether the activity of a metabolic pathway is altered (19).",
                                "Because several metabolite intermediates involved in nucleotide metabolism were altered in Mll3/4 KO cells, we decided to focus our study on the role of MLL3/4 on nucleotide synthesis. Nucleotide metabolism is an essential metabolic process that enables the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Nucleotides support nucleic acid and protein synthesis, energy preservation, signaling activity, and cytoskeletal function (16). Nucleotides can be produced through the de novo or salvage synthesis pathways. The de novo pathways utilize amino acids (such as glutamine and other small molecules) to build the purine and pyrimidine rings.",
                                "On the other hand, the purine salvage pathway recycles existing nucleosides and nucleobases such as hypoxanthine to maintain purine nucleotide pools. To further investigate whether changes in nucleotide levels observed in Mll3/4 KO cells reflect alteration in metabolic flux through the de novo or purine salvage pathways (FIG. 2A), we employed LC-MS-based isotope tracing (15 N-(amide)-glutamine and 13C-hypoxanthine). 15 N-glutamine tracing study revealed that Mll3/4 KO cells exhibit increased flux through de novo purine synthesis but not significantly through de novo pyrimidine synthesis (FIG. 2B-D). Interestingly, 13C-hypoxanthine tracing study also showed that the purine salvage pathway is also slightly increased in Mll3/4 KO cells (FIG. 2E). Overall, these metabolic studies suggest that cells depleted of MLL3 and MLL4 have a higher flux through purine synthesis and are more dependent on purine metabolic pathway genes for survival.",
                                "Mll3/4 KO mESCs Confer Enhanced Sensitivity to Purine Synthesis Inhibition",
                                "We hypothesized that Mll3/4 KO cells should have enhanced sensitivity to purine synthesis inhibition due to the metabolic dependency shift towards purine nucleotide synthesis pathways. WT and Mll3/4 KO cells were treated with lometrexol (LTX), a de novo purine synthesis inhibitor targeting glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GART). On the other hand, hypoxanthine (HPX), one of the nucleobases for purine salvage pathway, was added to rescue the purine synthesis inhibition by LTX (FIG. 3A). We observed elevated sensitivity to LTX in Mll3/4 KO cells, and the cell growth and/or viability inhibition was completely rescued by HPX (FIG. 3A, FIG. 10A). If Mll3/4 KO cells gain sensitivity to de novo purine synthesis inhibition, we hypothesize that these cells lacking MLL3 and MLL4 should also be sensitive to pathway inhibition upstream of purine synthesis including folate-mediated one-carbon (1C) metabolism. Indeed, Mll3/4 KO cells showed enhanced sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX) and SHIN1 (FIG. C). MTX targets dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and de novo purine synthesis, and SHIN1 inhibits serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT1/2), which further demonstrated the metabolic rewiring in Mll3/4 KO cells. In order to elucidate the differential sensitivity of LTX treatment in the presence or absence of MLL3/4, we performed RNA-seq to compare the gene expression change in WT and KO cells in response to LTX and/or HPX treatment (FIG. 3B). Interestingly, principal component (PC) analysis showed that the majority of variance of gene expression was explained by PC1 (94%) which was separated by the genotype of mESCs (WT or Mll3/4 KO) (FIG. 3C). HPX alone elicited subtle gene expression or phenotypic change, whereas LTX treatment induced significant gene expression change which was almost completely rescued by HPX in both WT and Mll3/4 KO cells (FIG. 3C). The differentially expressed genes in WT and KO cells were also uniquely altered in response to LTX treatment, with a more prominent effect in KO cells (FIG. 3D). A significant number of the upregulated genes in KO cells were further elevated by LTX treatment (top cluster in KO LTX group), while downregulated genes in KO cells were further depressed (bottom cluster in KO LTX group) (FIG. 3D). The differential sensitivity to LTX treatment promoted us to investigate the unique gene expression changes between WT and KO cells. First, we found 1063 genes commonly downregulated with LTX treatment in WT and KO cells (FIG. 3E). The pathway analysis demonstrated these genes enriched in biological processes related to amino acid and cofactor metabolism, which was an expected outcome of purine synthesis inhibition by targeting GART (FIG. 3F). When analyzing the pathway enrichment of uniquely downregulated genes in WT cells with LTX treatment, we identified processes related to RNA and its metabolism (FIG. 3G). In contrast, the uniquely downregulated genes in Mll3/4 KO cells with LTX treatment were enriched in pathways related to actin filament-based process and microtubule cytoskeleton organization (FIG. 311). On the other hand, there were 1195 genes commonly upregulated with LTX treatment (FIG. 10D), and they were enriched in a variety of biological processes including chromatin organization, cellular response to DNA damage, and stress stimulus (FIG. 10E). Another interesting observation was that the enriched pathways for the uniquely upregulated genes in WT and KO cells were reciprocal to that of downregulated genes (FIG. 10F, G). The distinct gene expression signature changes in the presence or absence of Mll3/4 may predict the differential sensitivity to LTX treatment.",
                                "To investigate whether the elevated purine biosynthesis inhibition sensitivity is due to the loss of catalytic dependent or independent activity, we compared the LTX treatment in WT, MLL3/4 \u0394SET (20), and MLL3/4 KO cells. Loss of SET domains did not affect COMPASS subunits stability specific to MLL3/4 including NCOA6 and UTX, but the bulk levels of H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 were reduced to a similar level in MLL3/4 \u0394SET and MLL3/4 KO cells compared with WT cells (FIG. 11A). Of note, the shift of UTX proteins from nucleus to cytosol compartment and the downregulation of NCOA6 were also only observed in complete KO cells not MLL3/4 \u0394SET cells (FIG. 11B). Finally, we showed the sensitivity to LTX of MLL3/4 KO cells is largely due to the catalytic independent activities of MLL3/4, as MLL3/4 \u0394SET cells exhibited indistinguishable sensitivity to LTX in comparison to WT mESCs (FIG. 11C).",
                                "A Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) Proteomics Profiling Identifies Purine Metabolism Possessive Upregulation in Mll3/4 KO Cells",
                                "Due to the profound change in gene expression in WT and KO cells (\u2014 4500 down- or upregulated genes with adj.p<0.01), it is difficult to dissect what are the most significant gene/protein signature changes that lead to the metabolic dependency shift and other cellular defects seen in Mll3/4 KO cells. As a complement of RNA-seq approach to identify the transcriptomics change, we took TMT proteomics approach to quantify the total protein level alteration between WT and Mll3/4 KO cells. In summary, we identified 7,379 total collapsed proteins, 7,096 quantified proteins, and 57,479 quantified peptides. PC analysis demonstrated the separation of genotype by PC1 using all 7096 proteins identified in TMT (FIG. 12A). A stringent cutoff (fold change >1.75, p.val<0.01) identified 343 proteins upregulated and 384 proteins downregulated in MI13/4 KO cells (FIG. 12B). We further confirmed that protein levels of MLL3/4 COMPASS identified and quantified by TMT approach were consistent with our previous Western blot analysis with significant diminished levels of MLL4 (Kmt2d), NCOA6, UTX (Kdm6a), and PTIP (Paxip1) (FIG. 7B and FIG. 12C). Pathway enrichment analysis of the downregulated proteins in KO cells showed several processes related to cytoskeleton organization, cell shape regulation, cell junction organization, and cell-cell adhesion (FIG. 12D), and the terms were consistent with the MLL4 peak annotation with KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (FIG. 7E). Among the biological processes of annotated as upregulated genes in Mll3/4 KO cells, there was significant enrichment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I pathway (FIG. 12E). The identity of sub-terms in this group (Group 1) were all related to nucleotide metabolic pathways (FIG. 4A), in accordance with the increased de novo purine synthesis and purine salvage upregulation in MLL3/4 KO cells (FIG. 3C, E). It is important to note that a major function of mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is also upregulated, is to support nucleotide metabolism (21). Further, the heatmap revealed 59 proteins in Group1 change between WT and KO cells related to purine nucleotide metabolic processes (FIG. 12F), suggesting Mll3/4 KO cells also exhibited elevated expression levels of purine metabolism genes. Collectively, we observed that loss of MLL3/4 functions rewired cells to require higher demand for purine and/or pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis for viability and survival.",
                                "Identification of Suppression of Purine Metabolism Pathway with Integration Study of TMT, RNA-Seq and Hi-C",
                                "We integrated RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT proteomics study to seek the top target genes of MLL3/4 and determine the transcriptional clue for purine metabolism genes' regulation. An overall consistency of RNA and protein changes was shown with a correlation of 0.797 (FIG. 4B). Using the RNA and protein correlation plot, we also identified factors with protein level change but not RNA, including MLL4 and NCOA6 (FIG. 13A). The top 20 down-regulated targets with both RNA and protein levels were selected for further functional analyses (FIG. 4B). These genes were likely to be the direct transcriptional targets of MLL3/4; a significant reduction of H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac and an increase of H3K27me3 were found surrounding the enhancers of these genes (FIG. 13B-E). Next, we knocked down each of the 18 genes with shRNAs and analyzed the RNA-seq data after batch removal (except for Rnf213 and Dppa3, due to the unavailability of efficient shRNAs) (FIG. 13F). Ncoa6 was also included as a control since it was the most down-regulated COMPASS subunit when MLL3/4 were depleted (FIG. 7B, FIG. 12C and FIG. 13A). First, we confirmed the knockdown efficiency of individual shRNAs (FIG. 13F). Interestingly, Ncoa6 knockdown also led to the downregulation of most of these top MLL3/4 targets (FIG. 13F). A significant overlap of gene regulation was found with Ncoa6 knockdown and Mll3/4 depletion, reassuring the co-function of MLL3/4 and NCOA6 (FIG. 13G). Then, we analyzed the set of purine metabolism genes' expression, which were elevated after MLL3/4 depletion (FIG. 12F). A collection of genes knockdown showed partial upregulation of the purine metabolism gene set (including Map6, Khdc3, Ghpr2, Mcf2, Susd2, and Ncoa6) (FIG. 4C). A number of these MLL3/4 targets were involved in the spindle and cytoskeletal function, suggesting that the change of cell shape and cell state may ultimately drive the metabolic dependency change when the activity of MLL3/4-COMPASS is impaired.",
                                "Another bold assumption of the metabolism reprogramming in MLL3/4 deficient cells is the consequence of the higher order chromatin structural change due to MLL3/4 loss. To investigate this potential mechanism, we performed Hi-C in WT and MLL3/4 KO mESCs to explore the relationship between chromatin structure and epigenetic alterations in defining the metabolic rewiring. The loop number increased from 10,118 to 13695, when MLL3/4 are depleted, as well as the B to A compartment shifting (FIG. 14A). To quantitate and visualize compartment strength, we plotted interaction frequencies along the first eigenvector to generate compartmentalization saddle plots (FIG. 4D, E). The results revealed that the strength of A-A interactions was gained while the strength of B-B interactions was diminished in MLL3/4 KO cells (FIG. 4D, E). Majority of A and B genomic compartments are unaltered upon MLL3/4 depletion, but shifted regions primarily undergo decompaction and B to A compartment shifting (6.79% of B to A, and 2.01% of A to B) (FIG. 4F). To correlate the gene expression with the AB compartment shifting, we examined the gene expression change located at the B-A and A-B shifted compartments found in FIG. 4F. A significant upregulation of gene expression was observed in MLL3/4 KO cells when they are located within B-A shifted compartments, whereas gene expression was largely unaffected in stable and A-B shifted compartments (FIG. 4G). Consistently, the eigenvector of the top upregulated genes' TSS in MLL3/4 KO cells was significantly higher than WT cells (FIG. 14B). In contrast, the eigenvector of the top downregulated genes' TSS in MLL3/4 KO cells remained the same as WT cells (FIG. 14C). In summary, the higher order chromatin structure change due to MLL3/4 loss adds another layer of gene expression control and contributes to the metabolic conversion.",
                                "MLL4 Mutant Colorectal Cancer Cells are Selectively Sensitive to Lometrexol Treatment",
                                "MLL4 is highly mutated in a variety of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Some of the loss-of-function mutations are believed to function as driver mutations, conferring competitive advantages for clonal expansion (22). Given our studies in mESCs (FIG. 1-4), we sought to examine whether cancer cells bearing MLL4 loss-of-function mutations share similar gene expression profiles. We focused on colorectal cancer since MLL4 has a relatively high rate of mutation in this type of cancer. We first examined CCLE colorectal cancer cell line RNA-seq data. When we analyzed the contribution of all genes to the principal component (PC), truncation mutation of MLL4 tends to segregate the different cell lines along PC2, suggesting genes (anti)correlated with PC2 are those dysregulated as a result of MLL4 truncation mutation (FIG. 15A). The top genes anti-correlated with PC2 (or upregulated genes in MLL4 truncation versus WT) were found in intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway by p53 class mediator, cell projection morphogenesis, and protein polyubiquitination such as BCL2, PIAS2, E2F2, etc. On the other hand, the top genes correlated with PC2 (or downregulated genes in MLL4 truncation versus WT) were found in matrisome associated, myeloid leukocyte activation, response to wounding, inflammatory response, extracellular matrix organization, and hemostasis such as MMP7, APOE, ACE2, etc (FIG. 15A). Similar GO terms were also found in downregulated genes of Mll3/4 KO versus WT mESCs (eg. cytoskeleton organization, matrisome associated, cell junction organization) (FIG. 15B, C, FIG. 7E, FIG. 12D), suggesting loss-of-function MLL4 mutation in colorectal cancer shares similar gene expression features with mESC depleted of MLL3/4. We further examined the differentially expressed genes in MLL4 Truncation and WT patient samples from TCGA PanCancer Atlas (FIG. 15D, E). Some of the key pathways of the downregulated genes were consistent between colorectal cancer cell lines and patient samples including cell junction organization and matrisome associated (FIG. 15D, F). One of the crucial consequences of MLL4 truncation mutation is the upregulation of immune response activation found in the patient samples (FIG. 15E), which was missing from in vitro cell line study. Our finding is consistent with a previous study showing MLL4 deficiency sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade (23), and the mutation status of MLL4 (especially truncation mutations) in cancer patients may predict response to immunotherapy and influence patient stratification and decision making.",
                                "Next, we sought to examine whether colorectal cancer cells bearing MLL4 mutations exhibited elevated sensitivity to lometrexol treatment. Eight colorectal cell lines were selected for comparison including normal epithelial cells (FHC), MLL4 wild type cancer cells (Caco2, SW1417, HT55), and MLL4 mutant cancer cells (SW480, DLD1, HCT116, RKO) (FIG. S16A). It's worth noting that all cancer cell lines have mutations on MLL3 but not UTX (FIG. S16A). Our studies showed that cell lines that harbor MLL4 mutation (especially truncation mutations) were selectively more sensitive to lometrexol treatment than their MLL4 wild type counterpart cells (FIG. 5A and FIG. 16B, C), indicating purine nucleotide synthesis is a general synthetic lethal pathway in MLL3/4 COMPASS deficient cells. Due to the role of MLL4 in mitochondrial metabolism and the fact that upregulation of genes enriched in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I pathway in MLL3/4 KO mESCs (FIG. 12E), we further treated colorectal cancer cells with Piericidin A or Phenformin\u2014the mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We observed no sensitivity difference between MLL4 WT and mutant cells (FIG. 16D, E).",
                                "We further employed 15 N-glutamine tracing in MLL4 WT (SW1417 and Caco2) and MLL4 truncation mutation (RKO and HCT116) colorectal cancer cells, and demonstrated that mutant cells exhibited increased flux through de novo purine synthesis (FIG. 17A, B). Next, we generated MLL4 truncation mutated (MLL4hNTD) or MLL4 complete knockout (MLL4KO) CAL51 breast cancer cells and measured sensitivity to methotrexate (MTX). CAL51 cells with compromised MLL4 functions gain elevated MTX sensitivity (FIG. 17C). The cytotoxic effect of MTX on MLL4KO cells was rescued by inosine not thymidine, further confirming the inhibitory effect via purine synthesis but not dTMP synthesis (FIG. 17D). We also knocked down GART and PAICS, two key enzymes for de novo purine synthesis in these colorectal cancer cells (FIG. 17E). Both cellular growth and colony formation were significantly decreased in MLL4 mutant cells (RKO and HCT116) but not MLL4 WT cells (Caco2 and HT55) (FIG. 17F-J). Our data demonstrated that cancer cells with reduced MLL4 functions have an elevated flux through purine synthesis and are more sensitive to inhibitors targeting de novo purine synthesis specifically. Lometrexol Elicited Downregulated Mitotic Cell Cycle Genes Expression in MLL4 Mutant Cancer Cells",
                                "To investigate the potential mechanisms of LTX induced cytotoxic effects in MLL4 WT and mutant cells, we examined a panel of cell cycle and apoptosis markers (FIG. 5B, FIG. 18A). A significant downregulation of histone H3 Serine10 phosphorylation (H3 Ser10-p), CDT1 and CyclinB1 was observed only in MLL4 mutant cells but not WT cells, indicating LTX induced cell cycle arrest and mitotic defects (FIG. 5B). We further examined the gene expression change 24 hours after LTX treatment in order to define a unique gene expression signature associated with LTX. Consistent with the morphological change and cell cycle defect, LTX only induced significant differential gene expression change in MLL4 mutant cells (FIG. 18B). In total, there are 885 genes commonly downregulated by LTX treatment in all MLL4 mutant cells (FIG. 5C-E), and these genes were unaffected in MLL4 WT cells (FIG. 5D, E). Vice versa, 707 genes commonly upregulated by LTX treatment in MLL4 mutant cells were unaffected in MLL4 WT cells (FIG. 18C-E). LTX downregulated genes were involved in mitotic cell cycle, regulation of chromosome organization, PLK and AURORA kinase pathways, and G2/M transition (FIG. 5F). For example, PLK1 and AURKA gene expression were remarkably diminished in all MLL4 mutant cells in response to LTX while the gene expression remained the same in MLL4 WT cells (FIG. 19A, B). Out of the 885 commonly downregulated genes, we focused on a collection of 217 genes related to mitotic cell cycle pathways and examined their gene expression in MLL4 mutant cells. The top 20 downregulated genes involved in mitotic cell cycle pathways in each cell line were shown in the volcano plots (FIG. 19C). We next defined a \u201clometrexol responsive mitotic gene signature\u201d including PLK1, AURKA, CDCA3, CDC20, SFPQ, POLA1, PSRC1, KIF20A, FAM83D, and DLGAP5, all of which were the top downregulated genes in each MLL4 mutant cell line, with no effect in MLL4 WT cells (FIG. 19D).",
                                "Inhibition of De Novo Purine Synthesis by Lometrexol Inhibits MLL4 Mutant Tumor Growth",
                                "Based on the biological effects of LTX in vitro, we hypothesized that LTX treatment should suppress MLL4 mutant tumor growth in vivo in different xenograft models. To determine the anti-tumor activity of LTX in MLL4 mutant tumors, we subcutaneously implanted HCT116 cells into the right flank of mice and treated the mice with LTX (25 mg/kg) or vehicle control (DMSO) intraperitoneally when tumor size reached 100 mm3 (day 6 after implantation). Mice were euthanized when the tumor size reached 1,000 mm3. LTX treatment significantly inhibited the subcutaneous (sc) tumor growth (P<0.0001, FIG. 6A-C) and extend the survival of recipient mice with HCT116 sc xenografts compared to the control group (P<0.0001, FIG. 6D). Cell proliferation was significantly decreased accompanied with enhanced apoptosis (FIG. 6E). We next decreased the dosage of LTX to 15 mg/kg and compared the tumor growth of HT55 (MLL4 WT) and HCT116 (MLL4 mutant) (FIG. 20). HT55 colorectal was almost completely resistant to LTX (FIG. while HCT116 xenograft tumors maintained the sensitivity to LTX at a lower dose (FIG. 20E-H), indicating the mutation status of MLL4 may be useful for patient stratification and guide the treatment plan for cancer patients.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "Our study involving CRISPR dropout screen combined with metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics approaches presented evidence of direct crosstalk between epigenetic alteration and metabolic dependency shift (FIG. 6F). We demonstrated that mESCs depleted of MLL3/4 acquired higher demand for purine nucleotide synthesis and elevated levels of purine metabolisms factors (FIG. 6F). De novo nucleotide synthesis is usually activated in proliferating cells in response to the enhanced demand for nucleotides to support RNA and DNA synthesis, and cancer cells tend to use de novo nucleotide synthesis (16). The observation that Mll3/4 knockout cells have elevated nucleotide synthesis flux implicates a cellular state alteration and further impairment during cell fate transition (9, 10).",
                                "Recurrent mutations in the genes encoding KMT2C (MLL3) and KMT2D (MLL4) are frequently found in a broad spectrum of cancers, and some of these mutations are believed to behave as driver mutations (7, 24-26). We and other groups have demonstrated that some of these mutations may act as major mediators in the pathogenesis of breast cancer (26), bladder cancer (22, 27, 28), prostate cancer (29), pediatric brain cancer medulloblastoma (30-32), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (26, 33-36). In Kabuki syndrome, a multisystem disorder resulting in abnormalities during development caused by mutations in KMT2D and KDM6A genes, \u02dc60% of KMT2D mutations result in protein truncation and loss of function (13-15). Although the occurrence of recurrent mutations in MLL4 has been well documented in these solid tumors, hematological malignancies, and Kabuki syndrome, the associated signaling pathways involved in how MLL4 mutation lesions drive oncogenesis and disease progression remain elusive. Recent exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing studies revealed that MLL3/4 and UTX mutations are not only found in tumor tissues but also present in normal tissues such as esophagus (37, 38), endometrial epithelium (39), urothelium (22, 28), skin, and lung (40). This indicates the loss of function of MLL3/4 COMPASS mutations may lead to the macroscopic clonal expansion to further drive tumorigenesis when other key tumor suppressors are co-mutated. Our study showed a metabolic dependency shift caused by MLL3/4 loss. This provides insights into how clonal expansion may occur and how interventions of metabolism inhibition at early stages may prevent clonal expansion. It is worth investigating whether mutations of MLL3/4 and UTX elicited broad changes in gene expression that favor cell proliferation and activate proliferative signaling, further inducing metabolic programming. It is also worth elucidating whether these effects are dosage-dependent for MLL3 and MLL4 as most of the loss-of-function mutations are heterozygous in the patient tumor samples. We also noticed that the presence of multiple missense mutations may contribute to the abnormal protein functions such as the mutations in DLD1. MLL4 mutation occurs throughout the whole protein, and mutations may elicit different outcome depending on the different domains. Truncation mutations frequently result the loss of enzymatic activity since the SET/postSET domains are located on the very C-terminus of the protein. Other missense mutations occurring on the critical PHD fingers or other domains may also contribute to the abnormal protein functions, yet due to unknown mechanisms. One possibility is the compromised H4K16ac reader function since PHD6 finger of MLL4 (MLL4-PHD6) as a selective reader of the epigenetic modification H4K16ac shown in a previous study (41).",
                                "MLL4 has also been shown to suppress glycolytic genes in lung tissue, and deficiency of MLL4 confers glycolytic vulnerabilities in lung cancer (42) and melanoma (43). However, another study using MEFs and skin fibroblasts showed that MLL4 knockout cells display features of reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and glycolytic flux (44). The disparity may have arisen since MLL4 may regulate distinct sets of genes in different tissues based on their origin and depending on their differential enhancer activation. Nevertheless, our study and previous studies all address that MLL4 has an influential impact on function for multiple aspects of metabolism including nucleotide metabolism, glycolysis, and mitochondrial metabolism, and the use of metabolism inhibitors such as lometrexol to suppress MLL4 mutant cancer cell growth. Interestingly, we have noticed a consistent downregulation of mitotic genes such as PLK1 and AURKA after lometrexol treatment, so we defined the gene set as \u201clometrexol responsive mitotic gene signature\u201d. Indeed, our RNA-seq results also echoed a previous study to propose the use of aurora kinase inhibitors for MLL4 mutant cancer (45).",
                                "The enhanced purine synthesis flux in MLL3/4 knockout cells displayed increased sensitivity to nucleotide synthesis inhibition upon lometrexol treatment (FIG. 3). Metabolic therapies against nucleotide metabolism and amino acid metabolism have been widely tested and used for a variety of cancers (46). We demonstrated that MLL4 mutant colorectal cancer cells are selectively sensitive to lometrexol treatment. There are multiple nucleotide synthesis inhibitors that have been used in clinical trials (47). Further investigating if mutations of MLL3/4 COMPASS predict a higher sensitivity and response to these nucleotide synthesis inhibitors in human cancers and developmental diseases will be critical for enhancing patient treatments. Overall, our study provides insights into the identification of novel therapeutic targets and approaches to exploiting the reprogrammed regulation of metabolic pathways in human cancer for future clinical translation.",

                                "Background: In our previous study, we aimed to explore the sensitivity of tumor cells with MLL3/MLL4/UTX-COMPASS mutations to lometrexol, an inhibitor targeting de novo purine synthesis. To achieve this, we used a variety of cell line-based systems, including wild type and MLL3/4 knockout isogenic mouse embryonic stem cells, multiple cancer cell lines with MLL4 wild type or mutant genotypes, and CRISPR correction knock-in isogenic human cancer cell lines. Our results showed that MLL4 mutant tumor cells are highly sensitive to lometrexol. We also observed the same phenomenon in xenograft mouse models of colorectal cancer, using MLL4 wild type and mutant cell lines. Overall, our findings suggest that lometrexol could be an effective treatment for tumors with MLL3/MLL4/UTX-COMPASS mutations.",
                                "N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) is a carcinogen, that mimics the tobacco use in human. When administered to C57/B6 male mice in drinking water for at least 20 weeks, causes muscle invasive bladder tumors (MIBC) (1). Besides, 70% of Kmt2d/MLL4 is mutated in BBN mouse model, mimicking high MLL4 mutation rate (and low UTX mutation rate) found in colorectal cancer (1, 2). Thus, we believe that this is a valuable system where we could examine the effect of lometrexol in bladder cancer based on the MLL4 mutation stratification.",
                                "Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is that tumors with MLL4 mutations may be more responsive to treatment with lometrexol in BBN induced bladder cancer mouse model.",
                                "Experiment design: Thirty 7-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were used in our study to induce bladder cancer by feeding them with 0.1% BBN containing water for 6 weeks. The mice were then randomized into two groups: DMSO (n=15) or lometrexol treatment (n=15) and were given intraperitoneal injections of the respective treatments twice a week at a dose of 15 mg/kg for 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, the bladder tissues of the mice were harvested for H&E staining and RNA isolation. Each mouse's tumor grade was assessed, and RNA samples were analyzed for mutations in the kmt2d/MLL4 gene through mRNA-seq. Finally, we compared the MLL4 genotype and treatment to the tumor stage to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.",
                                "Results: The mice with MLL4 mutant tumors receiving lometrexol treatment has significant lowered tumor stages compared with other groups (Fisher's exact test, p=0.037) (FIG. 21A, B).",
                                "Discussion: Our results in BBN bladder cancer mouse model bucket trial revealed MLL4 mutation within COMPASS is a reliable stratification marker for lometrexol sensitivity, depicting a targetable metabolic dependency arising from epigenetic factor deficiency. Our study further provides insight to inform therapy for cancers with epigenetic alterations secondary to MLL3/4 COMPASS dysfunction.",
