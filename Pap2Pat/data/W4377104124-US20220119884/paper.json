    "date": "2023-05-17",
    "abstract": "T-cell recognition of antigen epitopes is a crucial step for the induction of adaptive immune responses, and the identification of such T-cell epitopes is, therefore, important for understanding diverse immune responses and controlling T-cell immunity. A number of bioinformatic tools exist that predict T-cell epitopes; however, many of these methods highly rely on evaluating conventional peptide presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, but they ignore epitope sequences recognized by T-cell receptor (TCR). Immunogenic determinant idiotopes are present on the variable regions of immunoglobulin molecules expressed on and secreted by B-cells. In idiotope-driven T-cell/B-cell collaboration, B-cells present the idiotopes on MHC molecules for recognition by idiotope-specific T-cells. According to the idiotype network theory formulated by Niels Jerne, such idiotopes found on anti-idiotypic antibodies exhibit molecular mimicry of antigens. Here, by combining these concepts and defining the patterns of TCR-recognized epitope motifs (TREMs), we developed a T-cell epitope prediction method that identifies T-cell epitopes derived from antigen proteins by analyzing B-cell receptor (BCR) sequences. This method allowed us to identify T-cell epitopes that contain the same TREM patterns between BCR and viral antigen sequences in two different infectious diseases caused by dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The identified epitopes were among the T-cell epitopes detected in previous studies, and T-cell stimulatory immunogenicity was confirmed. Thus, our data support this method as a powerful tool for the discovery of T-cell epitopes from BCR sequences.",

                "T-cell epitope recognition is fundamental to inducing proper and robust cellular and humoral immune responses during adaptive immunity induced by various triggers, including infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity, transplantation, and cancer [1]. Short peptides recognized by T-cells, termed T-cell epitopes, are presented as a complex associated with the groove of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Complexes of the T-cell epitope and MHC elicit distinct T-cell responses depending on different MHC classes [2,3]. MHC class I usually binds short peptides (e.g., 9-mer) and activates CD8 + T-cells to differentiate into cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) during cellular immunity. By contrast, MHC class II interacts with slightly longer peptides (e.g., 15-mer), which are mainly expressed on professional APCs, cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) during cellular immunity. By contrast, MHC class II interacts with slightly longer peptides (e.g., 15-mer), which are mainly expressed on professional APCs, including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B-cells. These cells take up exogenous antigens to stimulate the differentiation of CD4 + T-cells into helper T-cells. CD4 + helper T-cells producing interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-2 promote CTL responses, whereas helper T-cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 promote the activation and differentiation of B-cells, resulting in antibody production in humoral immune responses.",
                "The identification of T-cell epitopes enables a mechanistic understanding of various diseases and immune responses, which might help improve vaccine designs. Given the vast diversity of antigens, polymorphisms in MHC and the T-cell populations of individuals, bioinformatic analysis is a powerful tool for predicting T-cell epitopes. Many in silico methods of T-cell epitope prediction have been developed [1,4]. However, many of these are highly dependent on evaluating the probability of possible target epitope sequences for MHC binding and antigen processing, and do not focus on more direct epitope sequences scanned by T-cell receptors (TCRs).",
                "To establish a new T-cell epitope prediction strategy and take advantage of data generated by TCR/B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing, we focused on: (1) Idiotopedriven T-cell/B-cell (T-B) collaboration; (2) The immune network theory proposed by Jerne [5] (Figure 1)."

                "Infecting antigens or antigens taken up by phagocytosis in a professional antigen-presenting cell (pAPC) are processed and presented as peptides (red) on the MHC molecule to be recognized by specific T-cells. The activated Tcells recognize a peptide (T-cell epitope) on a target cell or B-cell and exert effector functions as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in cellular immunity and as helper T-cells both in cellular and humoral immunity, respectively. In T-B collaboration, the helper T-cells recognize an antigen-derived peptide (red) and promote the production of antibodies against the antigen, while in idiotope (id)driven T-B collaboration, they recognize an idiotypic peptide (red) and help B-cells produce antibodies containing ids (red). (B) Molecular mimicry. Antibody 1 idiotypic antibody (Ab1) is specific for an antigen (Ag). Anti-idiotypic antibody Ab2 will be induced as a consequence of idiotypic interactions and will recognize Ab1. Ab2 is specific for the paratope of Ab1, and thus, exhibits molecular mimicry with the Ag. Analysis of Ab2 sequences will thus identify Ag-derived sequences.",
                "First, the so-called T-B collaboration is the interaction of a T-cell and B-cell during antibody production, where the B-cell captures antigens on the BCR expressed on the plasma membrane, degrades them, and presents the resulting peptide on MHC class II to cognate CD4 + T-cells, which recognize and are already activated by the same antigen, and pass activation signals to the B-cells (Figure 1A) [6]. In contrast, idiotope-driven T-B collaboration is characterized as a specialized T-B collaboration, involving idiotopes, immunogenic determinants produced in the variable regions of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules [7]. B-cells in idiotope-driven T-B collaboration display peptides derived from their own In T-B collaboration, the helper T-cells recognize an antigen-derived peptide (red) and promote the production of antibodies against the antigen, while in idiotope (id)-driven T-B collaboration, they recognize an idiotypic peptide (red) and help B-cells produce antibodies containing ids (red).

                "Second, according to Jerne's immune network theory [5], B-cells form a network of Igs through idiotypic interactions (Figure 1B). Each antigen-specific BCR sequence is created by random V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) [8]. The resulting BCRs display a novel sequence comprising one specific set of idiotopes, the idiotype, which determines the specificity of the antigen binding sites (paratope). Because of the complementary structures to antigens, the idiotopes of a given antibody (Ab1) can become immunogenic and stimulate the production of new antibodies with complementary idiotypes of Ab1 (Ab2, anti-idiotype). These idiotypic interactions lead to sequential reactions and the formation of antibody networks. Indeed, anti-idiotypic antibodies exist in organisms that recognize idiotopes of different antibodies [9][10][11][12][13]. An anti-idiotypic antibody specific for and binding to the paratope of an idiotypic antibody exhibits the molecular mimicry of the paratope to an antigen.",
                "Evidence for idiotope-driven T-B collaboration was reported in human diseases and mouse models [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. Given the presence of anti-idiotypic antibodies, we hypothesized that the analysis of BCR (anti-idiotypic antibody) sequences to determine the molecular mimicry of idiotopes and binding of idiotopes to MHC will identify T-cell epitopes that activate T-cells that recognize idiotopes, and thus, the original antigen.",
                "Here, we defined TCR-recognized epitope motif patterns and developed a new T-cell epitope prediction pipeline that performed a comprehensive search for full-length (FL) BCR sequences containing the epitope motif patterns that were present in the reference antigen sequences. This method identified the functional T-cell epitopes present during infectious diseases, including dengue fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This prediction method will be applicable to other diseases using different reference sequences, and thus, will be important for the identification of T-cell epitopes present during various immune responses."

Figure 3 displays the scheme (Figure 3A) and workflows (Figure 3B,C) of our T-cell epitope prediction method.  First, the unbiased BCR repertoire analysis method we developed [40] was employed to identify specific BCR clones (Figure 3A). Normally, the BCR repertoire observed in healthy donor samples has extremely high diversity, and BCR clones with high frequencies \u22651% are rare. By contrast, such clones are often observed in samples undergoing immune responses and are considered highly specific and related to the immunological state. Therefore, we selected such clones for subsequent analysis using our pipelined T-cell epitope prediction algorithm (Figure 3B). The FL sequences of BCR clones were produced in Step 1. Subsequently, BCR repertoire-specific TREM sequences were identified and characterized in terms of their TREM pattern, MHC binding affinity, SHM, and B-cell epitope probability in Steps 2-4. Reference TREM sequences and repertoire-reference common TREM were determined and characterized in Steps 5 and 6. After sample-specific TREM sequences were identified in Step 7, T-cell epitope candidates shared among samples were selected in Step 8."

In this step, allele information for each gene, V, D, J, and C, was also obtained from the results of repertoire analysis. At Step 1.2, the reconstructed nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences, producing FL BCR amino acid sequences. At Step 1.3, germline sequences corresponding to each BCR clone were acquired according to the allele information obtained at Step 1. At Step 1.4, the obtained germline sequences were translated to amino acid sequences, resulting in FL germline BCR amino acid sequences. At Step 1.5, SHMs were determined by comparing the FL BCR sequences with corresponding germline sequences.

We thus evaluated whether the FL BCR sequences contained such linear epitope sequences, which could be targeted by antibodies. For each clone, the FL BCR sequences were analyzed using BepiPred-2.0.

We thus concluded that IFN-\u03b3 production reflected mostly non-specific responses in the cultured ELISPOT assays. Half of the peptides (peptides 2, 8, 11, and 14), which had stronger HLA binding affinity for the tested HLA alleles (Tables 3 andS3), exhibited notable T-cell immunogenicity (Figure 6D,E). Among the confirmed peptides were all the peptides containing SHMs in the TREM sequences and only one germline-derived TREM peptide, suggesting that SHMs are more effective at providing T-cell immunogenicity. To further confirm the T-cell immunogenicity of the peptides, we performed ex vivo ELISPOT assays using PBMCs from an individual with a history of DENV infection. Stimulation with the pooled peptides elicited T-cell responses (Figure 6F). The responses might also include the cross-reactivity of T-cells because some epitopes are conserved between different DENV serotypes and other flaviviruses. Such conserved epitopes could induce protective immune responses, and thus, be vaccine candidate sequences. Taken together, our T-cell epitope prediction method efficiently identified T-cell stimulatory epitopes."

                        "SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is responsible for the current worldwide pandemic [49]. Toward understanding the human T-cell immunity and pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2, as well as developing effective vaccines, a number of epitope predictions against T-cell stimulating epitopes were made [50]. Such studies identified SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes and conserved epitopes across other coronaviruses, totaling over 58,000 epitopes as of January, 2022, in the IEDB. Given such deposition of epitopes, SARS-CoV-2 provides a great opportunity to assess our T-cell epitope prediction method further.",
                        "We predicted SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes using PBMCs isolated from 20 COVID-19 patients from Vietnam who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection [28]. BCR repertoire analysis resulted in 128 BCR clones with a frequency of \u22651% (98 for IgG and 30 for IgM). As in DENV infection, there were no overlapping clones among patients, and thus, it was confirmed that disease-specific BCR clones were highly specific to individuals. T-cell epitope prediction was conducted using these clones and reference sequences, including three SARS-CoV-2 isolates that were collected in Vietnam, the original strain from Wuhan, other SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, P.3, B.1.617.2, and BA.1, and other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1. Our analysis revealed 72 SARS-CoV-2 TREMs (Figure 7A), of which 26 (36.1%) were found in the reported SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes with T-cell activity, such as cytokine release, activation, cytotoxicity, qualitative binding, and proliferation (Figure 7B, Supplementary Data File S3). The corresponding proteins included spike (S), open reading frame 3a (ORF3a), ORF3b, ORF7a, membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), nsp12, and nsp14. Among the remaining 46 TREMs, 8 (11.1%) were reported to be negative for T-cell reactivity, and it had not been studied whether the other 38 (52.8%) could stimulate T-cells. Therefore, more positive TREMs were included in the predicted epitopes.",
                        "As for the DENV epitopes, the SARS-CoV-2 TREMs included SHM IGHV TREMs, germline IGHV TREMs, and matched human proteome-derived TREMs. Because these TREMs were previously confirmed to be T-cell-stimulating epitopes, the data support the notion that germline IGHV TREMs and TREMs encoded in the human genome do not simply provide tolerance to T-cells.",
                        "All 26 identified TREMs we examined were conserved across all SARS-CoV-2 variants, and several were also shared with SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and CCCs (Figure 7B), which may relate to previous findings of cross-reactive T-cell immunity [51]. Taken together, these results demonstrated that our T-cell epitope prediction algorithm enabled the identification of functional T-cell epitopes recognized by the T-cells that stimulate individual-specific and patient-common immune responses in infectious diseases.

Consequently, the idiotope-producing B-cells become abundant and their BCR sequences are detected by repertoire analysis. By analyzing such abundant BCR clones, we identified TREM epitopes with molecular mimicry for antigens in the cases of two different infectious diseases caused by DENV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, there were no identical 9-mer or 15-mer sequences between BCR and the antigens, which confirms that TREM motifs have more relevance for T-cell epitope prediction than the complete peptide sequences. The identified epitopes were validated in this study, and some were confirmed by previous reports.",
                "Interestingly, despite there being no overlap in the BCR clones, our analysis revealed the conservation of TREMs among individuals and among distinct clones during different phases in the same individual, with the maximum observed conservation being all 18 individuals in DENV infection. This indicates that even though every BCR clone is unique, the BCR repertoire appears to converge among different individuals experiencing viral infection, and changes over time, while maintaining a certain degree of antigen specificity. The conserved TREMs may represent such a factor, being involved in this type of convergence and maintenance. The conserved TREMs included many germline TREMs. Although it was previously shown that T-cells are tolerant to germline-encoded Ig sequences [44], our results demonstrated the T-cell immunogenicity of the germline TREM. This germline TREM had SHMs in MAM sequences in 59.6% of clones, and 24.3% sequences with MAMs mutations showed increased binding affinity. Thus, unlike previous data, germline TREMs would not readily provide T-cell tolerance, and T-cell tolerance to germline BCR sequences could depend on individual HLA types, rather than the sequence itself. This may also be true for human proteome TREMs [55] because TREMs overlapping with the human proteome were among the confirmed TREMs for T-cell stimulation.",
                "In addition to affecting MAM sequences, SHMs and V(D)J recombination, as expected, appeared more important for controlling TREM sequences in terms of T-cell tolerance and Tcell immunogenicity because of the following reasons. First, most of the identified referencerepertoire common TREMs were SHM TREMs and were present in CDR3-containing regions. Second, SHMs converted germline BCR sequences to antigen-specific TREMs. Third, T-cell immunogenicity was confirmed for all tested SHM TREMs (3/3), unlike germline TREMs (1/5). Furthermore, SHMs and V(D)J recombination might facilitate the creation of individual-specific and public T-cell populations. The patient-specific, unique TREMs were almost all SHM TREMs. By contrast, there were convergent mutations that converted one germline IGHV allele sequence into another germline sequence in different individuals, which resulted in the same conserved TREMs. These conserved TREMs may be prominent T-cell epitopes that are associated with antigen specificity and are commonly recognized by T-cells in various individuals.",
                "Recently, it has been reported that autoantibodies against the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a binding target of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, are generated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and this may have implications for the development of long COVID after SARS-CoV-2 infection [56,57]. These antibodies represent anti-idiotypic antibodies that have molecular mimicry with S proteins. Furthermore, autoantibodies against chemokines were observed in COVID-19 and are associated with severity and long COVID [58]. These autoantibodies may induce anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic those chemokines, or might be anti-idiotypic antibodies that have sequences resembling their receptors. These provide evidence that anti-idiotypic antibodies are induced in infectious diseases, and strongly supports our concept of T-cell epitope prediction, which involves searching for mirror images of antigens in BCR sequences. Therefore, our T-cell epitope prediction strategy will also be useful for investigating the cause of such autoimmunity that results from viral infection, as well as diseases involving changes in immunological status.",
                "In general, it is thought that antibodies target structural epitopes, whereas TCRs recognize linear epitopes. Thus, the molecular mimicry of anti-idiotypic antibodies may represent such a \"structural\" property. However, TREM-like linear epitopes repeatedly found in antibodies stimulated the production of antibodies against the original antigens, and elicited T-cell responses [12]. Despite these findings, there is still a substantial gap in our knowledge regarding the extent to which T-cell linear epitopes with molecular mimicry are present in BCR sequences. Further comprehensive identification and experimental examination of T-cell epitopes in BCRs are needed to understand the importance of the T/B-shared linear epitopes with molecular mimicry in the immune system."
