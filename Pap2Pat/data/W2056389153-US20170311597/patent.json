    "abstract": "Identification and evaluation of a set of first-in-class potent inhibitors targeting a new cancer target, Grb2-associated binder\u02dc1 (GAB1), which integrates signals from different signaling pathways and is frequently over-expressed in cancer ceils. Intensive computational modeling is utilized to understand the structure of the GAB1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and screened five million compounds. Upon biological evaluation, several inhibitors were found that induced large conformational changes of the target structure exhibited strong selective binding to GAB1 PH domain. Particularly, these inhibitors demonstrated potent and tumor-specific cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells. This targeting GAB1 signaling may be used for cancer therapy, especially for triple negative breast cancer patients.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Overexpression of Grb2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1) has been observed in several human cancers, such as breast and lung cancers. This protein is a substrate of several growth factors and interleukin receptors, and it is involved in the integration of different signal transductions. Particularly, GAB1 mediates the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K) cascades. It belongs to a family of scaffolding proteins closely related to the insulin receptor substrates (e.g., IRS1). It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain binding to phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), tyrosine phosphorylation sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) binding and a proline-rich domain interacting with Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. PH domains can be subdivided into four groups based on their selective binding to phosphoinositides, and GAB1 PH domain belongs to Group 1 which exhibits the strongest binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but weak affinity and specificity to PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2. Additionally, the phosphorylation of GAB1 on Y627 depends on the intracellular translocation from cytosol to membrane by binding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via its PH domain. Therefore, inhibition of GAB1 PH domain functions may prevent the recruitment of GAB1 to the membrane and suppress cancer cell (e.g., breast cancer) proliferation and metastasis. Herein, the inventors have identified novel small molecule inhibitors that selectively target the PH domain of GAB1, and that exhibit high therapeutic potency for cancer treatment.",
                        "Unfortunately, no three-dimensional (3D) structure is available to date for GAB1 PH domain or any PH domain in complex with drug-like small molecules. Challenges remain for accurate structural prediction due to its low sequence identity (<30%) to other PH domains with known structures. However, the core n-sandwich fold among PH domains is conserved, making it possible to construct a reliable homology model structure of GAB1 PH domain. Here, based on the position-site specific matrixes (PSSM) obtained from all non-redundant PH domain structures, the inventors performed fold recognition and homology modeling, followed by intensive structural refinement. The resulted model was then applied to high-throughput virtual screening of a unique collection of over five million drug and lead-like compounds with an in-house drug discovery workflow (FIG. 1). Upon biological evaluation, five out of the initially tested 20 hits exhibited positive activities to form direct binding to GAB1 PH domain, inhibit GAB1 Y627 phosphorylation and suppress breast cancer cell proliferation with low micromolar IC50. As is known, triple negative breast cancers are more aggressive with poor prognosis and difficult to treat clinically, but the inhibitors showed high potency against these malicious cells. Therefore, this present invention validates the effectiveness of the in silico platform for drug discovery, and demonstrates that targeting the PH domain of GAB1 provides a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.",
                        "Outside of biological treatments, there are other ways to treat cancer. These include: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually only used in cancer that is isolated in one place and not metastasized cancer. Chemotherapy has ill side-effects due to it targeting many fast growing cells. Radiation therapy has the potential to kill even non harmful cells. Within biological treatments, there are four main categories. The first is rituximab, which can target antigens on cancerous cells which in turn can signal antigens on B-cells. These B-cells can then lyse the cancerous cells. One major advantage that the present invention has over these types of therapies is versatility. In order to target specific antigens, the drug must be specifically made to do this. Antigens differ from cell to cell, so different drugs have to be made to target different cell types.",
                        "Another type of treatment involves removing the immune system's inability to attack the body's own cells. Drugs such as ipillimumab can allow immune cells to attack body tissue. This opens up a large possibility of immune cells attacking tissue that is not cancerous or harmful. Therefore, a variety of autoimmune issues may emerge from this treatment path. A third type of biological cancer treatment involves attaching a cell-killing substance onto an antibody. When the antibody binds onto a cancerous cell antigen, the cancer cell with intake the cell-killing substance, and promptly undergoes cell death. Again, there is the chance that non-cancerous cells may uptake this substance and undergo apoptosis. Lastly, there exist the inhibitory biological compounds similar to the present invention. In addition to inhibiting GAB1 there are compounds which inhibit other molecules like growth effectors such as cetuximab and panitumumab. Unlike the present invention, these treatments are usually specific to cancer that is caused by a mutation in the KRAS gene.",
                        "In the present invention, the compounds may be used as a cancer therapeutic drug. Some advantages of the present invention are that the compound works upstream of other chemical components, the compounds do not directly target components of the immune system, and this biological inhibitor-based treatment has less damaging side effects than radiation or chemotherapy. There are a few call signaling pathways that are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. Two of these pathways are the RAS pathway and the PI3K pathway, and both of these pathways are deregulated in the formation of human cancer thereby leading to the over-production of GAB1. It has been shown that inhibiting upstream components of pathways complicit in tumorigenesis can reduce the rate of cancer. This is demonstrated in inhibitions of PI3K in the PI3K pathway. The invention has demonstrated that GAB1 inhibitors exist in a variety of compounds and that they have the potential to reduce the rate of tumorigenesis in humans.",

To improve the quality of homology modeling, the multiple sequence alignment generated by ClustalX were manually corrected to ensure each secondary structure elements (e.g., \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheets) were properly aligned. GAB1 PH domain homology models were built using MODELLER 9v10. As the active site residues of DAPP1 have the highest homology to those of GAB1 PH domain, the coordinates of the IP4 co-crystallized with DAPP1 was used as the initial structure. The initial 1,000 homology models were generated. Since the lysine-rich loop \u03b21,2 is important for phosphoinositide binding, especially for Group 1 PH domain, the \u03b21,2 loop of top ten initial models (evaluated by DOPE score) were subjected to ligand-steered refinement using built-in function of MODELLER. Five models were selected out of the 100 generated loop models based on the overall DOPE scores, Ramachandran plot, and the consistencies to IP4 binding site features and the reported mutagenesis studies. These five GAB1-IP4 complex models were refined by MD simulations using AMBER10 available at Texas Advanced Computing Center. All MD simulations were performed in triplicates with different initial velocities. The MD simulations were performed using ff99SB force field in TIP3P explicit solvent with particle mesh Ewald (PME), periodic boundary conditions and SHAKE.

Protein pharmacophore modeling was performed using GRID v22c. Briefly, the GRID calculations were performed with a grid box enclosing the target with 1 \u212b beyond each dimension. During the calculations, the GRID directive Move was set (MOVE=1) to allow the flexibility of the side chains. The molecular interaction fields (MIFs) were computed to determine the interaction between the receptor atoms and three different probes: the hydrophobic (DRY), the amide nitrogen (N1, H bond donor), and the carbonyl oxygen (O, H bond acceptor). Via visual inspection of the local minima of the GRID energy maps, the favorable binding sites of these three probes were used to define the features of a pharmacophore query. The derived pharmacophores were used to evaluate the binding poses of the initially selected 10,000 hits out of the five million compounds. If the docked hit poses fit the pharmacophore, they would be selected and subjected to clustering analysis based on the MACCS fingerprints and Tanimoto coefficient.

                        "PH domains are unique due to their conserved secondary structures and 3D folds, all with seven \u03b2-sheets and a C-terminal helix. However, the pairwise sequence identities among different PH domains are usually below 30%, and the loop regions are hypervariable in length and amino acid sequence. Herein, the inventors collected all available 34 non-redundant crystal structures of PH domains from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and performed secondary structure-based sequence alignment using STRAP. From the sequence alignment, the inventors generated PSSMs for \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b26, \u03b27 and \u03b11 (presented as sequence logos in FIG. 8) to guide secondary structure prediction of new PH domain (e.g., GAB1). As no reliable PSSMs for \u03b24 and \u03b25 were generated due to low sequence similarity, the inventors used PSIPRED server to predict these two \u03b2-sheets.",
                        "FIG. 8 shows the sequence logos derived from the collected 34 PH domains, in which the size of residue indicates the relative frequency of that residue at the corresponding position. As expected, the most conserved residues are found in the hydrophobic cores of PH domains. The residues responsible for phosphoinositide binding are generally located at \u03b21[7], \u03b22[2], \u03b22[5], \u03b23[4], \u03b23[+1] and \u03b27[1] (the number in the brackets indicates the residue position at the secondary structure element). Predominantly, they are basic residues such as lysine and arginine. These observations were combined with PSSM and PSIPRED to predict the secondary structure of GAB1 PH domain, and found the predicted structure preserves a typical \u03b2-sandwich fold where C8-K14, W26-L33, V44-Y48, R58-D61, Q66-G71, I84-N88, and R92-V97 form the respective seven \u03b2-sheets, while E101-I114 forms the C-terminal \u03b1-helix (FIG. 2). However, the GAB1 PH domain is unique with: 1) a long \u03b21,2 loop landmarked by the conserved K14 and W26, similar to myosin X (PDB ID: 3TFM); 2) a long \u03b22,3 loop, similar to IRS1 (PDB ID: 1QQG); 3) a long \u03b25,6 loop, similar to TAPP1 (PDB ID: 1EAZ); 4) the highest sequence identity of active-site residues (except for \u03b21,2 loop region) to DAPP1 (PDB ID: 1FAO) (shadowed residues in FIG. 2). Therefore, the above four proteins were chosen as the templates for the following-up homology modeling studies.",

                        "The inventors constructed 1,000 homology models of GAB1 PH domain in complex with inositol-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) based on the X-ray crystal structures of four aforementioned templates. After loop refinement and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, one reliable model was selected in which IP4 binds stably to GAB1 PH domain with a minor fluctuation of phosphates (RMSF <1.1 \u212b), shown in FIG. 9. The simulation of this model reached the equilibrium after 5 ns, as judged by the RMSD of all of the backbone atoms (C, CA and N) (FIG. 9). Large fluctuations of the Ca atoms were only observed in the \u03b21,2, \u03b22,3 and \u03b25,6 loops (FIG. 9). The quality of the lowest-energy model was assessed by QMEAN, ProSA and PROCHECK. The Ramachandran plot showed reasonable backbone dihedral angles: 92.2% of the residues were in the most favored regions, and eight residues in the additional or generously allowed regions. Both the ProSA Z-score (\u22124.04) and QMEAN Z-score (\u22120.13) of final model were within the range as typically seen for the native proteins of the similar size (FIG. 10). In addition, the DOPE per-residue profile demonstrated a significant decrease in the DOPE scores at the \u03b22,3 loop, \u03b24,5 loop, \u03b25, \u03b25,6 loop and \u03b26 for the refined structure compared with the initial homology model (FIG. 11).",
                        "As illustrated by FIG. 3A, the 3D model of GAB1 PH domain maintained the conserved \u03b2-sandwich folding. Similar to other Group 1 PH domains (e.g., Grp1 and Btk), the phosphoinositide-binding site of GAB1 was surrounded by the \u03b21,2, \u03b23,4 and \u03b26,7 loops. The 2-hydroxyl group of IP4 oriented towards the \u03b21,2 loop, and the 3,4,5-phosphates intensively interacted with the aforementioned basic residues in the \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b24 and \u03b27. Particularly, K19 and R23 in the \u03b21,2 loop formed hydrogen bonds with 5-P and 1-P, respectively (FIG. 3B). This explains why GAB1 PH domain specifically binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 but not PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2. Strikingly, the sequence motif NKKEFE in the \u03b25,6 loop folded into an additional \u03b1-helix, as termed \u03b1\u2032. This additional \u03b1-helix also occurs in phospholipase C\u03b4 PH domain (PDB ID: 1MAI), and it interacts with W26, F79 and Y95 in the \u03b21,2 loop via hydrogen bonding networks and hydrophobic interactions (FIG. 3C). This \u03b1\u2032-helix was likely to stabilize the IP4-bound conformation of \u03b21,2 loop, as W26A or W26C mutation impairs the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding. Furthermore, the motif SPP in the \u03b21,2 loop formed intensive vdW interactions with the \u03b27 and inositol scaffold (FIG. 3C). Finally, GAB1 PH domain had an extra hydrophobic region (later defined as Region II) due to the smaller side chains of those hydrophobic residues around \u03b26,7 loop compared to IRS1. All these specific structural features intrinsically offered possibility of designing selective inhibitors against GAB1 over other PH domains, as further discussed in the ligand-induced conformational changes section.",

Residues K14, R23, K27, R29, R58 and R92 were identified as the residues that favorably interact with hydrogen bond acceptors, whereas Y47, F94 and I60 were specified as the preferential areas for hydrophobic moieties (FIG. 12). The residues responsible for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding were predicted to be K14, K27, R29, Y47, K49, R58 and R92, consistent to the mutagenesis studies. These critical residues were employed to define the protein pharmacophores to select docking poses of those 10,000 top ranked hits (only based on docking scores ranging 43.47-101.39) from the virtual screening of over five million compounds of the in-house collection. The resulted 2,783 hits were subjected to cluster analysis based on their chemical diversity (Tanimoto coefficient <0.65), and the inventors obtained 268 clusters and selected the best-scored hits from each cluster (FIG. 1).

The experiments revealed that 10 out of 20 hits demonstrated submicromolar to micromolar binding affinity (<50 \u03bcM) to GAB1 PH domain measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

In addition, it inhibited Y627 phosphorylation and killed breast cancer cells at IC50=23.7\u00b12.7 \u03bcM (for T47D). GAB-004 achieved similar binding selectivity as GAB-001, but had a stronger inhibition of pY627 (81%) and a lower IC50 (19.4\u00b12.9 \u03bcM). Interestingly GAB-007 demonstrated weak binding (KD=42.3\u00b18.9 \u03bcM) and mild pY627 inhibition (53%), but it showed high cytotoxicity in both MDA-MB-231 (IC50=4.6\u00b10.7 \u03bcM) and T47D (IC50=20.1\u00b14.3 \u03bcM) cell lines (FIG. 5), probably due to other off-target mechanisms.

The principle of this approach has been described elsewhere. Here, this method was implemented using ff99SB force field. Briefly, the umbrella sampling and weighted histogram analysis were used as the primary tools to derive two sets of PMF: ligand conformational PMF w(\u03be) and protein-ligand separation PMF w(r). The details of mathematical calculations were described in the Results section, and the w(\u03be) and w(r) plots for eight protein-ligand complexes were available in FIG. 17 and FIG. 18. As indicated by FIG. 6 and Table 2, the predicted absolute binding free energies via PMF method were in a good agreement with the experimental values (RMSE=0.64 kcal/mol, R2=0.85). One may notice that these predictions encompassed two different PH domain targets (GAB1 and IRS1) and a variety of ligand chemotypes.

When comparing the bound and unbound protein structures, it was observed for the first time the ligand-induced conformational changes in three regions around the phoshpoinositide-binding pocket (termed as Region I, Region II and Region III) for both GAB1 and IRS1 PH domains.",
                        "The Region I is comprised of the conserved K14GAB1/K21IRS1 (\u03b21[7]), K27GAB1/K21IRS1 (\u03b22[2]), Y47GAB1/Y46IRS1 (\u03b23[4]) and F94GAB1/F93IRS1 (\u03b27[3]) (FIG. 7A-E). The MD simulations showed significant conformational changes in Region I (RMSD >2 \u212b) for both GAB1 and IRS1, as illustrated by the RMSD analysis (red plots in FIG. 7A). The side chain rearrangement of these residues, especially K14GAB1/K21IRS1 and Y47GAB1/Y46IRS1, created a pocket which favorably binds an aromatic moiety connecting with a H-bond acceptor group. This moiety could form cation-\u03c0 and hydrophobic interactions with the surrounding K14GAB1/K21IRS1 and F94GAB1/F93IRS1, respectively (FIG. 7B-7E). All inhibitors identified in this study contain such a pharmacophore (phenyithiazole in GAB-004, phenylisoxazole in GAB-010, S-phenyl carbothioate in GAB-007, benzenesulfone in GAB-001, GAB-016 and GAB-017) (FIG. 19). As previously mentioned, the \u03b21[7], \u03b22[2] and \u03b23[4] were the PIP3-binding residues, thus Region I conformational changes were attributable to the activities of the inhibitors. Generally, the conformational changes of Region I residues in GAB1 were more substantial than IRS1, except F94GAB1 (FIG. 7A). In comparison, GAB-010 could induce an alternative conformation of F93IRS1 (FIG. 7E), which also occurred in ArhGAP9 crystal structure (PDB ID: 2POD). The function of conformational change of F93IRS1 is likely to further open the pocket to accommodate larger moiety such as phenylisoxazole (GAB-010), as other IRS1 Region I residues were less flexible.",
                        "The Region II is formed by \u03b24, \u03b26,7 loop and the first several amino acids of \u03b27 (FIG. 7A-E). The key residues are R58GAB1/R62IRS1 (\u03b24[2]) and R92GAB1/E91IRS1 (\u03b27[1]). Compared with Region I residues, more significant conformational changes were observed in the Region II residues in the GAB1 PH domain (RMSD >2.5 \u212b) (blue plots in FIG. 7A). These conformational changes created a new pocket which binds aliphatic (GAB-016 and GAB-017) and aromatic moieties (e.g., chlorobenzothiophene in GAB-001 and furan in GAB-004). Remarkably, the bulky aromatic moieties (GAB-001 and GAB-004) generally induced more movement of GAB1 Region II residues than the aliphatic moieties (GAB-016 and GAB-017) (blue plots in FIG. 7A). It was also observed that significant conformational changes only occurred in GAB1, but not in IRS1 PH domain (blue plots in FIG. 7A), probably because the electrostatic attraction between R62IRS1 and E91IRS1 significantly restrained the fluctuation of these two residues, while the electrostatic repelling between R58GAB1 and R92GAB1 made these two residues more flexible. These findings imply that the flexibility of Region II residues of PH domain may correlate the size of binding group.",
                        "The Region III is located on the solvent-accessible side of the \u03b27, especially I92GAB1 or H92IRS1 (\u03b27[3]) (FIG. 7A-E). When GAB-010 binds IRS1 PH domain, the benzimidazole moiety induced a significant side chain movement of H92 (RMSD=3.39 \u212b) as compared with unbound form (magenta plots on the right in FIG. 7A. In contrast, this region in GAB1 PH domain did not exhibit significant conformational changes when binding any inhibitor (magenta plots on the left in FIG. 7A). Upon comparison of GAB1 and IRS1 PH domain sequences, it is speculated that the accessibility of Region III was affected by the length of \u03b21,2 loop: GAB1 PH domain has a longer \u03b21,2 loop than IRS1 (FIG. 2), and the residues P16 and P17 forms intensive vdW interactions with \u03b27, which would in turn block the access of inhibitors to Region III. This explains the selective binding of GAB-010 to IRS1, but not GAB1 PH domain.",
                        "GAB1 is a critical protein in cellular signaling, and its PH domain has been suggested as an attractive target for various cancer treatments. However, the absence of its 3D structure makes it challenging for structure-based drug discovery. Herein, the present invention features a rigorously designed workflow for inhibitor identification by integrating various techniques ranging from structural bioinformatics, homology modeling, ligand-steered refinement, molecular dynamics, and virtual screening, followed by experiment evaluation with biochemical/biophysical and cellular assays. With the integrated protocol, several selective inhibitors have been successfully identified targeting the GAB1 PH domain and they are selective to breast cancer cells. This discovery offers a great starting point to target this critical protein for cancer treatment, particularly for the triple negative breast cancer.",
                        "The results also showed that the triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was more resistant to GAB1 inhibitors than ER-positive breast cancer cell line, T47D (Table 1). It has been reported that MDA-MB-231, but not T47D, has mutations on GAB1 downstream proteins, such as KRas and BRaf mutations. Since KRas and BRaf mutations are known to reduce the dependency on the upstream activators, such as EGFR, it was not surprising that MDA-MB-231 was more resistant to GAB1 inhibitors. Strikingly, it was observed a concomitant inhibition of pGAB1 and pIRS1 by either GAB1-specific or IRS1-specific inhibitors (FIG. 14). This could be due to the crosstalk between c-Met and \u03b16\u03b24 integrin pathway, which couples the phosphorylation of GAB1 and IRS1 upon HGF stimulation. These observations may bring new insights of combined PH domain-targeted cancer therapeutic strategies.",
                        "Although selective inhibitors of the GAB1 PH domain have been identified using the unique computation-experimentation integrated platform, the inventors further disclose that some of the other hits also bind to multiple PH domains (e.g., IRS1 and AKT1), as demonstrated by Table 1. For example, GAB-001 and GAB-004 are selectively inhibitor GAB1, but GAB-016 and GAB-017 are pan inhibitors against GAB1, IRS1 and AKT1. More follow-up experiments also showed that GAB-016 targets GAB2 PH domain as well. In addition, GAB1 and GAB2 PH domains are highly homologous (76% sequence identity), and IRS1 is one of the templates used in the homology modeling to build the 3D structure of GAB1 PH domain. Of note, all GAB1-selective or IRS1-selective inhibitors showed much better IC50 against T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines than the non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cell line (FIG. 5). More intriguingly, it is also observed that AKT1-selective inhibitors (e.g., GAB-012 and GAB-013) were toxic to MCF-10A at 100 \u03bcM, but not for T47D and MDA-MB-231 at the same concentration (data not shown). This may imply that targeting GAB1 or IRS1, but not AKT1, might be a better targeted strategy for breast cancer treatment.",
                        "Although PH domains have been intensively studied as cancer target for drug discovery, to date there are no available protein structures in complex with any drug-like small molecules. As mentioned, this has significantly limited the structure-based drug discovery efforts. In the present invention, several inhibitors were utilized to investigate the dynamics of GAB1 PH domain and evaluate their selectivity in potential cancer cell inhibition. Interestingly, it was found that the apo-structure of the PH domain protein could undergo large conformational changes in three regions to accommodate different inhibitors. The side-chain conformations of the residues in Region I determines the binding of either multiple electronegative groups (e.g., the multiple phosphates in IP4) or an aromatic moiety conjugated with a group containing H-bond acceptors (e.g., benzenesulfone), as shown in FIG. 7. The accessibility of Region II and Region III depend on several critical amino acids on \u03b24 and \u03b27 and the length of \u03b21,2 loop, respectively. The selectivity of PH domain inhibitors may be designed based on the modeling of the protein structures. For instance, GAB-010 is highly selective to IRS1 but no binding to GAB1 or AKT1, largely due to the short \u03b21,2 loop. The knowledge that GAB1 PH domain undergoes conformational change upon ligand binding provides insights of guiding structure-based drug design efforts.",
