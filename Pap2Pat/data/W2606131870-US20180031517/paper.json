    "abstract": "New ionophores are essential for advancing the art of selective ion sensing. Metal-organic supercontainers (MOSCs), a new family of biomimetic coordination capsules designed using sulfonylcalix[4]arenes as container precursors, are known for their tunable molecular recognition capabilities towards an array of guests. Herein, we demonstrate the use of MOSCs as a new class of size-selective ionophores dedicated to electrochemical sensing of molecular ions. Specifically, a MOSC molecule with its cavities matching the size of methylene blue (MB + ), a versatile organic molecule used for bio-recognition, was incorporated into a polymeric mixed-matrix membrane and used as an ion-selective electrode. This MOSC-incorporated electrode showed a near-Nernstian potentiometric response to MB + in the nano- to micro-molar range. The exceptional size-selectivity was also evident through contrast studies. To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, a simulated wastewater experiment was conducted using water from the Fyris River (Sweden). It not only showed a near-Nernstian response to MB + but also revealed a possible method for potentiometric titration of the redox indicator. Our study thus represents a new paradigm for the rational design of ionophores that can rapidly and precisely monitor molecular ions relevant to environmental, biomedical, and other related areas.",

It has an edge-directed octahedral geometry and features an outer diameter of 3.3\u2009nm, an inner diameter of 1.7\u2009nm, and an internal volume of 1.2\u2009nm3. It possesses a total of seven well-defined binding domains, including one endo- and six exo-cavities (Fig. 1b). Recently, we have shown that the 1-Co MOSC molecule has the ability to selectively bind to MB+ in both solution and solid-state1213. Specifically, 1-Co encapsulates ca. 7 equivalents of MB+ (i.e., one MB+ per cavity) with an apparent binding constant of 1.42\u2009\u00d7\u2009104\u2009M."

                        "The characteristics of the 1-Co MMM ISEs were investigated using both impedance spectroscopy and potentiometry. The impedance of the MMM with and without 1-Co is shown in (Fig. 1c). A reduction of the charge-transfer resistance by a factor of two is revealed when comparing the MMM with 1-Co to the MMM without 1-Co. The decrease in charge-transfer resistance is a strong indication of 1-Co promoting MB+ ion transfer across the MMM\u2502analyte interface. This was the first sign that the MOSC molecule could be used for potentiometric sensing. It is worth noting that the understanding of the membrane constituents and resulting potential has been well-established31. Thus, the concentration-dependence of the phase-boundary potential across the MMM\u2502analyte interface (charge separation layer) is governed by the change in the ratio between free 1-Co and the complexed 1-Co within the first few nanometers of the MMM as well as the inclusion of counter-ions (ionic sites)32."

                        "For the initial potentiometric study, a conventional ISE with an inner filling solution was chosen because it has proven to be extremely versatile and can be easily set up in the laboratory31. The potential (Ewe) of the conventional 1-Co MMM ISE was recorded versus a standard Ag/AgCl reference electrode as depicted in Fig. 2a. The potentiometric results of the 1-Co MMM ISE shown in Fig. 2b give a near-Nernstian response to [MB+] with a slope of 56.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u2009mV/p[MB+] and a detection limit of ~300\u2009nM. As described above and previously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, 1-Co possesses endo- (\u00d8 ~1.7\u2009nm) and exo-(\u00d8 ~0.74\u2009nm) cavities that determine its ion-capture properties. The sizes of these cavities fit nicely with the dimensions of MB+ that has a length of 1.6\u2009nm and a width of 0.7\u2009nm33. Thus, the MB cation can orientate itself to fit into the endo-cavity by length and the exo-cavity by width. While the binding affinity towards the endo- and exo- cavities may differ, the effect should not alter the sensitivity as described by the Nernst equation2021. The ideal dimensional match of MB+ with the MOSC cavities enables the size-selective potentiometric response to MB+. This result provides clear evidence for the use of 1-Co as an ionophore and its direct implementation in ISE sensors.",
                        "The 1-Co MMM ISE was further investigated for its potentiometric response to a concentration series of ions much smaller in size (ionic radii) than MB+, including K+ (0.275\u2009nm)34, Ag+ (0.172\u2009nm)34, and NH4+ (0.143\u2009nm)35. It is of particular importance to note that the 1-Co MMM ISE expressed a substantially smaller response to the K+ (10.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009mV/p[K+]), Ag+ (5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u2009mV/p[Ag+]), and NH4+ (\u22126.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4\u2009mV/p[NH4+]), presumably because their sizes are too small to allow effective binding with the 1-Co MOSC molecule (Fig. S1). This draws a direct contrast to related calixarene molecules that were found to be efficient in recognizing small metal ions such as Co2+, Fe2+, Pb2+, Ag+, etc., through binding sites at their lower rim363738. In comparison, in the case of 1-Co, the lower rim of its precursor calixarene simply serves as a structural site by coordinating to Co(II) using its phenolic oxygen atoms. While this structural element is fundamental to the formation of the MOSC structure, it diminishes the affinity of the calixarene precursor to small metal ions due to the lack of available binding groups. The lower rim of the sulfonylcalix[4]arene in 1-Co is further tethered by the 1,4-benzendicarboxylate linker to generate an endo-cavity enclosed by aromatic walls (Fig. 1b). This configuration contributes to the selective recognition of bulkier molecular ions by virtue of a size matching and the so-called \u201ccation-\u03c0 interactions\u201d, a mechanism well recognized in the biological binding of molecular ions (such as neurotransmitters)39. In addition, the six exo-cavities are each capable of binding to an ionic species that fits within the cavity structures. The highly organized arrangement of these exo-cavities around the central endo-cavity thus provides an effective strategy to locally concentrate the target ion and thereby enhance the ion recognition as a result. These unique features are not accessible in the calixarene precursor and thus, we conclude that the MOSC-based ionophores are superior for the sensing of molecular ions."

                        "The size selectivity of this particular MOSC ionophore was further investigated by examining the response of the 1-Co MMM ISE to a cation with a size comparable to MB+ but a very different chemical structure. Tetrabutylammonium (TBA+; Fig. 1a) was chosen due to its spherical shape with a diameter around 0.8\u2009nm. The near-Nernstian response (60.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u2009mV/p[TBA+]) of the 1-Co MMM ISE to TBA+ is shown in Fig. 2b. The detection limit was ~1\u2009\u03bcM. The response time (for >\u200990% potential change) of the 1-Co MMM ISE for MB+ and TBA+, shown in Fig. 2c, proved to be extremely short, on the order of 1\u2009s (Fig. S2), for concentrations above ~30\u2009\u03bcM. The response was slower for lower concentrations with a time duration of 50\u2013100\u2009s, presumably a consequence of slowed ion-exchange kinetics40. A good potential stability with a drift that does not exceed a few mV/h is also evident in Fig. 2c. These results confirmed the size selectivity of the MOSC ionophore."

The SC-ISE is considered as a new generation ISE, benefiting from miniaturization, integration into microelectronics, and a decrease in cross-membrane ion fluxes3141. Ewe of the SC-ISE was also recorded versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode as depicted in Fig. S3a. The 1-Co\u00b7MMM SC-ISE exhibited the same near-Nernstian response to MB+ as the conventional setup (Fig. S3b). This result demonstrated the possibility of integrating MOSCs into solid state electronic sensors which can be mass produced with the well-established microelectronics industry at very low costs.",
                        "It is noteworthy that once the MMM was cast as either a conventional ISE or a SC-ISE, the stability of both MOSC and MB+ in the MMM was exceptional and showed no sign of leaching. A simple leaching test was performed by preparing two MMMs, one with 1-Co and one without, while keeping all other constituents the same. The MMMs were then stored in deionized (DI) water for over one week. No change in the color of the water for the MOSC MMM was observed since MB+ was captured by 1-Co. However, the solution in contact with the MMM without 1-Co turned blue, indicating that MB+ had leached out (Fig. S4). Notably, both the SC-ISE with a MMM that did not contain 1-Co and the ISE without MMM altogether (i.e. plain carbon electrode) did not show a pronounced potentiometric response to MB+ (Fig. S5). This further confirmed that the MMM ISE sensitivity resulted from the inclusion of the MOSC."

                        "To illustrate that the above proof-of-concept protocols can be applied in a more practical setting that involves a more complex analyte, we conducted a simulated wastewater experiment with water collected from the Fyris River (Fyris\u00e5n) in the city of Uppsala. By adding controlled amounts of the \u201cpollutant\u201d MB+, the response curve for the simulated wastewater remained near-Nernstian, although an apparent shift of the detection limit was observed (Fig. 3). We attribute this shift to a decrease in the oxygen content of Fyris\u00e5n\u2019s water caused by microorganisms found in the river water42. The loss of oxygen due to microorganisms after collection of the water sample produces a reducing environment, which can in turn decrease the actual MB+ ion concentration by a certain amount and cause a small shift in the response curve. This speculation was confirmed by a control experiment, in which an equal amount of MB+ was dissolved in DI water and the water from Fyris\u00e5n. The UV-vis absorption showed a lower concentration of MB+ in the river water (Fig. 3), indicating that MB+ was indeed being partially reduced. It should also be noted that, despite the reduction of MB+, the inclusion of wastewater to the system is not expected to change the detection limit of the ISE since the ISE responds to the MB+ only in the cationic form. Thus, the detection of MB+ by MOSC based ISEs provides a possible method for potentiometric titration of the redox indicator, an exciting aspect we are pursuing in future studies."

The unique endo- and exo-cavities of the MOSC molecule provide locally concentrated and potentially synergistic binding sites for large molecular cations while expressing limited sensitivity towards smaller cations. Our results demonstrate that MOSCs can serve as a new class of size-selective ionophores that are architecturally unique, chemically modular, and functionally robust. The myriad of possibilities to tune the ion recognition capability of the MOSCs by modifying their nanocavity structure, coupled with their ideal compatibility with both conventional and solid-contact ISEs, is anticipated to afford exciting new opportunities in a wide array of sensing applications including environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical surveillance. Many such potential applications remain elusive with currently available technologies."
