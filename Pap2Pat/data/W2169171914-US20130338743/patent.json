    "abstract": "The present invention provides a method of stimulating an excitable tissue (e.g., in vitro, in vivo) with a primary electrical stimulus through a primary electrode at a primary stimulation frequency, to produce a propagating action potential in the excitable tissue. The invention is carried out by concurrently stimulating the excitable tissue with a secondary electrical stimulus through at least one secondary electrode at a secondary stimulation frequency. The primary and secondary stimulation frequencies are preferably different from one another. The secondary electrical stimulus preferably has an amplitude not more than one third that of the primary electrical stimulus. Preferably, propagation of the action potential in the excitable tissue is enhanced (e.g., when propagation of action potentials in the tissue is otherwise unstable, partially blocked, or fully blocked). Apparatus for carrying out the method is also described.",

                        "Post-traumatic adjustment of pulse propagation in nerves with reduced excitability is a challenging biomedical and technological problem. In many cases such adjustments can be achieved with surgical interventions. However, surgery does not necessarily restore nerve conductivity to its pre-trauma levels, therefore still impaired conduction may cause partial or complete muscular paralysis. In this case propagation of excitation waves can be enforced only by applying external functional electrical stimulation (FES) using implantable [1] or surface stimulation electrodes [2-4]. This method has been confirmed as an effective tool for restoration of movement of paralyzed muscles in individuals with variety of neurological impairments [5].",
                        "Computerized systems for control of FES can deliver sequences of electrical stimuli with different frequency, amplitude and duration [6]. Commonly, these systems include variety of control units and electrical leads with multiple array or patch type stimulation electrodes. These electrodes deliver programmable stimuli, which are designed to maximize the effect of stimulation based on configuration of a particular stimulation field [7-10].",
                        "Successful FES process of functional restoration of muscle contraction depends on ability of nerve tissue to adequately conduct action potential. It also depends on excitation-contraction coupling in neuromuscular junctions, which transmit nervous impulses to muscular fibers. If any of these steps is impaired muscle does not contract normally. Usually, after severe neuromuscular injuries nerve conductivity is significantly reduced which, in turn, prevents the passage of excitation waves through neuromuscular transmitters. Under these circumstances propagation of excitation pulses is marginally stable and implementation of FES necessitates a significant increase of frequencies and amplitudes of functional electrical stimuli. The latest, instead of stabilization of propagation, can facilitate conduction blocks and may completely disrupt the process of training paralyzed muscles.",
                        "Accordingly, there is a need for new methods, systems and apparatus for stimulating excitable tissues which treat the problem of conduction instability and blockage therein."

King et al. reconfigures an excitation pattern by applying two spatially distinguished sub-threshold electrical stimuli. These stimuli create a superposition of local electric fields and induce additional supra-threshold excitation zones. In Schallhorn et al., reconfiguration of excitation pattern is achieved by a controlled activation of multiple spatially distributed stimulation sites combined in one lead. Both are simply dealing with reconfiguring of stationary excitation patterns using multiple spatially distributed periodic stimuli. Neither address dynamic features of the nerve action potential and in no way relate to stabilization of its propagation.",

FIG. 1B visualizes propagation of excitation waves which results from a superposition of main (primary) pulse and spatially distributed secondary stimulations applied to one-dimensional excitable cable. For our simulations we implemented rate dependent modification of analytically solvable two variable Chernyak-Starobin-Cohen (CSC) reaction diffusion model [11-13] as depicted in FIG. 2A. Equations (1),(2) describe the process of propagation of excitation in an one-dimensional excitable cable of finite length with linear dependence of excitation threshold (memory) on period of primary stimulations [14].",

Parameter vr is the critical excitation threshold necessary to initiate the propagation of an action potential through the cable. Another parameter of the model, \u03b5, reflects the two order-of-magnitude difference in time constants between the fast excitation and slow recovery processes.",
                                "According to the method of the present invention, a set of primary and secondary excitation sources formed a spatially distributed array of independent stimulation sites. The first site near the cable left end was a primary stimulation site. Over-threshold stimuli P(x, t) applied at this site initiated a sequence of primary excitation waves which propagated through the cable from left to right with a period T0 and amplitude A0. Secondary sub-threshold stimuli Si(xi,t) were applied at other stimulation sites with a period T and amplitude A, respectively. Secondary stimuli did not initiated additional waves, but provided additional charge to accelerate the propagation of primary waves.",
                                "If the first primary stimulus applied to a cable at rest (v(x, t=0)=vr) has a sufficient amplitude to overcome the excitation threshold vr , it will initiate action potential which will propagate along the cable. During the depolarization phase the magnitude of action potential, u, rises from its equilibrium state (u(x, t=0)=0) to the value of unity, while v rises from its resting value of The intersection between the values of u and v defines the beginning of the action potential. During the repolarization phase (refractory period) both u and v decrease from their maximum values toward corresponding resting values. This results in a second intersection between u and v near which marks the end of the action potential duration (FIG. 2B). At any particular spatial point of interest the action potential duration, TAP, was computed as the time interval between successive intersections of u and v. Action potential computations were performed after delivering 80 primary stimuli to ensure that all corresponding measurements reflected steady state values of TAP.",

In our simulations we used six equidistant secondary sites located between x=40\u0394x and x=140\u0394x . The primary stimuli P(x, t) (red dotted line) were applied at every point between x=2\u0394x and x=15\u0394x. Here \u0394x=0.23 is a spatial grid interval.

Secondary stimulations were simultaneously initiated at all six secondary sites after the first primary wavefront (intersection between u and v) reached the end of the cable.

At sufficiently long periods of stimulation a slow recovery current v has enough time to reach its equilibrium state vr before the next stimulus is applied to the cable. However, at shorter periods v does not completely recover and its minimum value, vmin, is still greater than the excitation threshold vr (FIG. 4A). Below a certain value of primary stimulation period Tend recovery current v becomes so much higher than vr, that the next primary stimulus may not result in initiation of a complete action potential. The latest may lead to instabilities that can occur in the form of alternating action potentials (alternans) or complex M:N (M>N) conduction blocks (FIG. 4B).",

FIG. 4C (dashed line) shows a phase portrait of the solution of Eqs. (1)-(2) in the absence of secondary excitations for Tend=30 and vr=0.24. In this case propagation of excitation wave is at a margin of stability and therefore countour of u significantly deviates from its N-shaped nullcline shown in black. Further decrease in primary stimulation period below the critical value T0*<Tend results in conduction blocks as depicted in FIG. 4B. On the contrary, FIG. 4C (solid line) demonstrates that propagation can be stabilized, if the secondary stimuli with sub-threshold amplitudes A=0.1A0 and periods T=T0* are applied in addition to primary stimulations."
