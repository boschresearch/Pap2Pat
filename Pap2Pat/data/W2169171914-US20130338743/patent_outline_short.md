# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to functional electrical stimulation of nerve tissue

## BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

- introduce post-traumatic adjustment of pulse propagation in nerves

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- describe method of stimulating excitable tissue with primary and secondary electrical stimuli

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS

- outline steps of the method

### EXAMPLE 1

- simulate propagation of excitation waves in one-dimensional nerve tissue

### EXAMPLE 2

- demonstrate principle of stabilization of excitation wave using additional sub-threshold stimulations

### EXAMPLE 3

- show resonant nature of dependence of action potential duration on amplitude of secondary stimuli

### EXAMPLE 4

- demonstrate dependence of resonant action potential locking on amplitude and frequency of secondary stimulations

### EXAMPLE 5

- show increase of safety margin of stability of primary waves at higher amplitudes of secondary stimuli

### EXAMPLE 7

- determine optimal number of secondary stimulation sources
