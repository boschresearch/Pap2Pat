- add phytohormones to culture medium
- keep dishes in phytochamber at 26Â° C
- transfer fragments into new dishes with fresh medium every 15 days
- evaluate callus induction percentages
- select callus fragments for cell cultures
- transfer callus fragments into liquid medium
- promote gas exchanges and cell dispersion
- centrifuge and separate supernatant from pellet
- extract taxanes from supernatant and pellet
- filter supernatant with nylon filter
- recover taxanes with methanol
- pulverise pellet and dissolve in methanol
- filter solution through nitrocellulose filter
- perform HPLC/MS analysis
- compare with standards
- confirm presence of taxanes in hazel and taxus cell cultures
