                        "It has been known for many decades that various types of taxus, in particular Taxus Brevifolia, contain a cytotoxic active ingredient, used as anti-tumour agent, known as taxol or paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a complex tricyclic diterpenoid with a side amide group, of the following formula (Wani et al., 1971):",
                        "This molecule, approved as an anti-tumour drug by the FDA in 1992, is one of the most promising drugs in the treatment of various types of tumour, like for example ovarian carcinoma, breast carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, tumour of the colon and of the lungs, melanoma, lymphoma and polycystic kidney disease (McGuire et al., 1989; Woo et al., 1994; Skell 1999).",
                        "Ever since taxol was approved for clinical use, substantial availability problems have arisen.",
                        "The species that contains the greatest amount of taxol is Taxus brevifolia, the most widespread taxus species in North America, and the bark is the comparatively richer part for active ingredient. North American taxuses were thus debarked for the production of the drug. The taxol yield is, however, rather low (0.01-0.03%); indeed, to obtain 1 kg of active ingredient about 7 tons of bark are needed, which is the equivalent of 2000-3000 trees, and the debarking of taxus causes it to die.",
                        "Since taxus trees, although quite common in the North-Western forests of America, are hardly ever a dominant species and as they have very slow growth rates, their large-scale debarking risked putting the conservation of the species in serious danger. The search for alternative and renewable sources of taxol thus began.",
                        "Initially the possibility of producing taxol by total synthesis was explored but despite the efforts of many research laboratories, the best result obtained involved an overall yield of 2% and extremely high costs (Holton et al., 1994).",
                        "Therefore, attention was turned to the possibility of obtaining the molecule semi-synthetically, starting from its natural precursors. Currently, the main precursor used in the semi-synthesis of taxol is 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which can be extracted with a good yield (about 0.1%) from T. baccata leaves. The method for the semi-synthesis of taxol officially approved by the FDA was devised by Holton and co-workers (Holton et al., 1995) and involves four stages only starting from 10-deacetylbaccatin III, with a taxol yield of over 80%.",
                        "This method currently constitutes the only commercially viable way of producing taxol with a good yield, but it still suffers from some limitations, linked to the need to extract the precursor from the taxus plants.",
                        "Firstly, the taxane content is subject to considerable variations, both in quality and in quantity, due to numerous factors including the species, the cultivar, the age of the plant, the environmental conditions, the season, the soil, the temperature.",
                        "Moreover, the slow growth rate of taxus trees is a factor that limits the extraction of taxanes.",
                        "Finally, the precursor must necessarily undergo an expensive purification procedure.",
                        "In the light of the limitations highlighted above, various experimental attempts have been made to obtain taxol from cellular taxus cultures, since in vitro cultures theoretically represent an unlimited source of the desired compound, thanks also to the possibility of using bioreactors that exert precise control on the production process.",
                        "It is worthwhile noting that the plant tissue culture is obtained from explants of differentiated tissue such as, for example, leaf, stem or root. The fragments obtained must be sterilised and then transferred, in aseptic conditions, in solid culture medium containing appropriate nutrients, vitamins, agar and phytohormones. These latter comprise two classes of compounds, auxins and cytokinins, often used in association with each other to promote a balanced cell growth and to induce the production of callus, i.e. a mass of tissue consisting of totipotent undifferentiated cells that are formed on the side of the explant two or three weeks after culturing. The callus can be propagated indefinitely, by transferring small fragments thereof into fresh medium, or else it can differentiate into root, leaf, bud, from which it is possible to induce the regeneration of a new plant. It is also possible to obtain cell cultures from the callus, upon transfer into liquid medium.",
                        "Cell cultures can produce secondary metabolites and release them into the culture medium or conserve them within the cells.",
                        "In the case of taxus, numerous authors have highlighted that cell cultures obtained from callus of different species of Taxus are capable of producing taxol, 10-deacetylbaccatin III and other taxanes (Wu et al., 2000, 2001; Cusid\u00f2 et al., 1999; Shen et al., 1999).",
                        "Patent application EP 0 568 821 describes a method for inducing callus cells capable of producing taxanes from explanted tissues and refers to plant tissues of the family of the Taxaceae.",
                        "Other documents that describe the production of taxol and/or taxanes from cell and tissue cultures of the Taxus species are application WO 95/02063, U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,054, application WO 92/13961 and application WO 95/02063.",
                        "Although taxol has always been considered a special product of the metabolism of the genus Taxus, several studies have highlighted that some species of fungi and bacteria (Taxomices andreanae, Pestalotiopsis microspora) that infest taxus are also capable of producing taxol and taxanes (Stierle et al., 1995; Pulici et al., 1997).",
                        "Hoffman and co-workers have shown that some American varieties of Corylus avellana (scientific name of hazel) contaminated by fungal pathogens have, in the leaves, in the branches and in the fruits, small amounts of taxol and other taxanes (Hoffman et al., 1998).",
                        "The amounts found are not, however, such as to realistically consider the possibility of extracting taxol and taxanes from the hazel plant.",
                        "Despite the numerous attempts to increase the production of taxol, its availability is still limited, due to the relative presence of taxol and taxanes in the differentiated taxus tissues and due to the difficulty in growing taxus cells in vitro.",
                        "In the light of the above it is clear that there is the requirement to find new sources of taxol and/or of its taxane precursors."

The selected fragments are transferred individually into a liquid culture medium, which can be one of those cited above, used for the induction of the callus, obviously without gelling agents or containing gelling agents in an amount such as not to cause the solidifying of the medium. Preferably, the MS medium is used, at the same concentration of phytohormones used for the induction of the callus.",

In FIGS. 2a and 2b the chromatogram and the mass spectrum of the taxol used as standard are shown and in FIGS. 4a and 4b the spectrum of the ions obtained from the MS/MS fragmentation of standard taxol and that of the taxol recovered in the hazel cell cultures are shown.",
                                "The presence of taxanes in the hazel has thus been confirmed and the production of taxol and taxanes in cell cultures of the same species has also been revealed for the first time. This suggests that also in the C avellana species there are enzymes involved in the metabolism of the taxanes.",
                                "It should also be noted that taxus and hazel are very different plants, both for growth and diffusion (the genus Taxus is somewhat rare and grows slowly, as opposed to the genus Corylus, which as well as being more common, also grows faster), and for genetic characteristics. Taxus, in fact, belongs to the group of the gymnosperms whereas hazel belongs to the group of the angiosperms. The first group comprises higher plants characterised by generally needle-shaped leaves and ovules that upon fertilisation transform into mainly woody strobili, whereas the second group comprises seed plants, endowed with flowers and ovules that, upon fertilisation, develop into fruits.",
                                "It is important to note that the in vitro cultivation of hazel, in particular starting from the seed, has proven to be more advantageous with respect to that of taxus; this is due to a greater ability of the hazel both of inducing callus from differentiated tissues of the plant (Table I), and of regenerating new young plants through the formation of buds from the undifferentiated callus tissue after about three months from the culturing of the different tissues, as shown in the data reported in the following table",
                                "The formation of callus from hazel was clear from 15 days after the culturing of the explants, whereas the taxus callus began to be assessable only after 30 days from the preparation of the dishes.",
                                "After 30 days of culturing the hazel reached the maximum callus induction percentage, even if with a large variability with respect to the hormone concentration and to the type of explant. The explants that have proven to be more productive were the seeds with a variable callus induction percentage of between 10.0% and 75%; the phytohormone that proved to be least suitable for inducing callus from hazel was BA when used alone at a concentration of 0.5 and 1 mg/l.",
                                "The taxus cultures reached the maximum callus induction after 60 days from culturing. Also in this case the BA phytohormone proved not to be very active, with the exception of the production of callus from seed revealed at 60 days for BA 1 mg/l.",
                                "Moreover, only one of the callus cultures obtained from taxus was capable of differentiating into bud and thus of producing a new young plant in vitro at a relatively low percentage (1%), whereas it was possible to obtain hazel buds and therefore young plants from callus induced in all of the hormone concentrations used by us with a greater frequency than that obtained for taxus.",
                                "Hazel therefore represents a rich and unlimited source of taxol and taxanes, both for its wide diffusion, and for the greater ease in being cultivated in vitro and in being regenerated in experimental conditions in which taxus regenerates with difficulty."
