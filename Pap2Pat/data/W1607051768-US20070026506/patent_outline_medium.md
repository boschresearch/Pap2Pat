# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF APPLICATION

- introduce cell culture production of active ingredients

## PRIOR ART

- motivate taxol as anti-tumour agent
- describe limitations of taxol extraction from taxus trees
- summarize attempts at total synthesis of taxol
- describe semi-synthesis of taxol from natural precursors
- highlight limitations of semi-synthesis method
- introduce cell cultures as alternative source of taxol

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- motivate need for alternative source of taxol
- describe method for producing taxol from hazel cells
- highlight advantages of method

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

- describe figures illustrating taxol production

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- obtain and prepare Corylus avellana plant material
- induce callus formation and cell cultures
- extract and analyze taxol and taxanes

### EXAMPLE

- prepare in vitro cultures of Taxus baccata and Corylus avellana
- induce callus formation with different hormone concentrations
- select and transfer callus fragments to liquid medium
- extract and analyze taxanes from supernatant and pellet
- perform HPLC/MS analysis of taxanes
- compare results with standards
- confirm presence of taxanes in hazel cell cultures
- discuss advantages of hazel over taxus for taxol production
- conclude on the potential of hazel as a source of taxol and taxanes
