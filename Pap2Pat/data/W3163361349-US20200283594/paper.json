    "abstract": "Bioinspired vascular networks transport heat and mass in hydrogels, microfluidic devices, self-healing and self-cooling structures, filters, and flow batteries. Lengthy, multistep fabrication processes involving solvents, external heat, and vacuum hinder large-scale application of vascular networks in structural materials. Here, we report the rapid (seconds to minutes), scalable, and synchronized fabrication of vascular thermosets and fiber-reinforced composites under ambient conditions. The exothermic frontal polymerization (FP) of a liquid or gelled resin facilitates coordinated depolymerization of an embedded sacrificial template to create host structures with high-fidelity interconnected microchannels. The chemical energy released during matrix polymerization eliminates the need for a sustained external heat source and greatly reduces external energy consumption for processing. Programming the rate of depolymerization of the sacrificial thermoplastic to match the kinetics of FP has the potential to significantly expedite the fabrication of vascular structures with extended lifetimes, microreactors, and imaging phantoms for understanding capillary flow in biological systems.",

Vascular and porous synthetic materials are also used for electrical insulation in microelectronics8, gas exchange in synthetic devices9,10, thermal management in heat exchangers and fiber-reinforced composites11,12, chemical reactions in flow batteries and microreactors13\u201315, and material regeneration in self-healing structures16,17.",
                "The new vasculature in biological load-bearing materials such as bone is created through coordinated deposition of new tissue and removal of old tissue, triggered by coupled cellular processes18\u201320. In contrast, the formation of vasculature inside synthetic materials requires an additional fabrication step to remove embedded sacrificial templates through pullout17,21, dissolution3,6,22\u201325, melting26\u201329, or thermal vaporization16,30\u201335 techniques. Vaporization of sacrificial components (VaSC) is the only method that enables the fabrication of complex vascular networks in load-bearing polymers and composites processed at high temperatures and pressures16,30,31,33. However, the VaSC process requires a sustained external heat source first to cure the host matrix and subsequently to depolymerize the sacrificial template (ca. 200\u2009\u00b0C for 12\u201324\u2009h under vacuum)31, consuming megajoules to gigajoules of external energy36. New strategies for faster matrix curing and template depolymerization at lower temperatures are thus desirable to reduce the time, energy, and complexity of fabricating vascular structures for aerospace, automotive, marine, biomedical, and renewable energy industries."

                        "Inspired by the coordinated vascularization process in biological structures, we have developed a coupled polymerization and depolymerization strategy for rapid manufacturing of vascular thermosets and composites under ambient conditions (Fig.\u00a01a). This synchronized process relies on the exothermic frontal polymerization (FP)37,38 of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) monomer. Here, a sacrificial template is first embedded in liquid or gelled DCPD resin. Brief (seconds), localized heating activates a latent second-generation Grubbs\u2019 catalyst (GC2) to initiate the self-propagating reaction wave that converts a liquid or gelled resin into rigid poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermoset (Fig.\u00a01b). The surplus of energy released during the curing reaction is harnessed for concurrent depolymerization of an embedded sacrificial template. This tandem approach eliminates the need for a sustained external heat source to manufacture vascular structures, enabling efficient fabrication at room temperature (RT).Fig. 1Overview of synchronized polymerization and vascularization concept.a Schematic representation of the coordinated fabrication of a microvascular structure. \u2780A sacrificial polymer template is embedded inside a liquid or gelled host matrix. \u2781A self-propagating exothermic polymerization reaction transforms the host into a solid matrix and concurrently depolymerizes the sacrificial template into small molecules through a localized increase in temperature. \u2782A durable thermoset with vasculature mirroring the starting template is manufactured under standard ambient conditions within minutes. b Scheme for FP of DCPD monomer (1) into crosslinked pDCPD (2) using a second-generation Grubbs\u2019 catalyst (GC2) and tributyl phosphite inhibitor (TBP). c Scheme for photoacid generator (PAG) catalyzed thermal depolymerization of PPC (3) into PC monomer (4).",
                        "Successful coordination between polymerization and vascularization requires a sacrificial polymer that remains stable during melt processing and integration into the host matrix, yet depolymerizes efficiently and rapidly under the thermal conditions generated during FP. In situ temperature measurements during FP of DCPD resin incubated to different degrees of precure (\u03b10) show maximum temperatures exceeding 200\u2009\u00b0C for \u03b10 \u2264 0.08, followed by cooling to below 100\u2009\u00b0C within 2 min (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c). The chemical enthalpy released during FP decreases with increasing \u03b10 (Eq.\u00a01 in the \u201cMethods\u201d section), thus reducing the maximum temperature. Thermal vaporization of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) templates used in prior vascularization methods requires several hours at such temperatures30,31, making PLA an unsuitable sacrificial polymer for our strategy. We found that these seemingly incompatible requirements for high-temperature processing and low-temperature depolymerization are satisfied by poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC)39. In its thermally stable state, PPC is templated into fibers, sheets, and printed architectures. An orthogonal stimulus such as UV light subsequently transforms the template into a thermally unstable state for facile depolymerization.",
                        "PPC is thermally stable up to 250\u2009\u00b0C but undergoes acid-catalyzed depolymerization into propylene carbonate (PC) monomer (Fig.\u00a01c) at much lower temperatures (100\u2013200\u2009\u00b0C)39. Melt extrusion of PPC blended with an acid catalyst is not feasible due to depolymerization at typical processing temperatures (150\u2013200\u2009\u00b0C). Instead, the high thermal stability of a diaryliodonium-based photoacid generator (PAG) (up to ca. 180\u2009\u00b0C39) enables the melt-spinning of PPC fibers (Mw ~ 196\u2009kDa) blended with PAG at 155\u2009\u00b0C without significant depolymerization (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). The depolymerization onset temperature (Td, defined by 5% mass loss) of as-spun PPC (1% PAG) fibers occurs at 200\u2009\u00b0C with complete mass loss at 230\u2009\u00b0C (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). Activation of the PAG via UV irradiation reduces Td to ca. 93\u2009\u00b0C with complete mass loss at 130\u2009\u00b0C, which is ca. 100\u2009\u00b0C lower than as-spun fibers. These mass loss results suggest that UV-irradiated PPC (1% PAG) templates are suitable for depolymerization during FP of the host matrix."

                        "Initially, we investigated the depolymerization of a single UV-irradiated PPC (1% PAG) fiber in tandem with FP of a DCPD gel (\u03b10 = 0.25) (Fig.\u00a02a). The sacrificial fiber is embedded in liquid resin which cures slowly at RT into a gel with the desired \u03b10 (Supplementary Table\u00a01). FP is triggered by briefly powering a resistive wire oriented perpendicular to the fiber. The polymerization front propagates through the specimen at ca. 0.6\u2009mm\u2009s\u22121 and vascularization trails by ca. 1.5\u2009mm (Fig.\u00a02a, Supplementary Video\u00a01). A slight distortion in the shape of the polymerization front also occurs near the sacrificial fiber. Temporal delays associated with heat conduction from the matrix to the template and its subsequent endothermic depolymerization into liquid and gaseous molecules are responsible for these observations. Optical microscopy of the microchannel cross section and X-ray computed microtomography (\u03bcCT) reconstruction of the microchannel volume reveal that the dimensions and circularity of the channel replicate the sacrificial fiber (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04 and Supplementary Table\u00a05). As expected, as-spun fibers without UV irradiation do not depolymerize in similar experiments (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). Vascularization of pDCPD specimens with UV-irradiated sacrificial fibers occurs in less than 2\u2009min under ambient conditions after triggering FP. Activation of the PAG and FP initiation require minimal energy input, ca. 108\u2009J, reducing the thermal energy consumption by six orders of magnitude compared to ca. 120 MJ estimated for conventional curing and VaSC steps for samples of similar size (Supplementary Table\u00a02).Fig. 2Experimental characterization and thermochemical modeling of the coordinated vascularization process.a Optical image of propagating FP reaction in a DCPD gel (\u03b10 = 0.25) in tandem with depolymerization of an embedded PPC (1% PAG) template to create vascular pDCPD (t\u2009=\u200931\u2009s after initiation). b Front velocity (black triangles) and maximum front temperature (red squares) during FP as a function of \u03b10 of the DCPD gel. Successful VaSC through complete depolymerization of PPC depends on the amount of heat released during FP, which decreases with increasing \u03b10. Sacrificial templates undergo complete depolymerization for \u03b10 \u2264 0.25. Partial depolymerization results in clogged microchannels for 0.30\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b10 \u2264 0.35 and FP is no longer possible for \u03b10 \u2265 0.40. Error bars represent one standard deviation from the mean (n\u2009=\u20093). c Simulation of a DCPD gel (\u03b10 = 0.25) showing the spatial distribution of the degree of cure (\u03b1) of DCPD and the degree of depolymerization (\u03b2) of the sacrificial template during FP (t\u2009=\u200931\u2009s after initiation). d Predicted spatial variation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the direction of the propagating front (t\u2009=\u200931\u2009s after initiation). Successful polymerization and vascularization are defined by \u03b1 and \u03b2 reaching 0.90 or higher, as shown by the \u03b10 = 0.25 case (orange lines). The \u03b10 = 0.35 case (blue lines) shows successful polymerization but unsuccessful vascularization, corroborating experimental observations.",
                        "The depolymerization kinetics of PPC is highly temperature-sensitive (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a, b) and successful vascularization depends on the surplus heat released by the host matrix during FP. Using the single sacrificial fiber geometry inside a glass mold, we explore the potential range of \u03b10 for vascularization of the host matrix. As \u03b10 increases, both the front velocity (Vfront) and maximum front temperature (Tfront) decrease (Fig.\u00a02b) due to a reduction in the fraction of chemical bonds capable of ring-opening during FP38. Concurrent FP and vascularization occur for \u03b10 \u2264 0.25, yielding fully evacuated channels. While the polymerization front still propagates in gels with 0.30\u2009\u2264\u2009\u03b10 \u2264 0.35, the released heat is insufficient for complete depolymerization of the sacrificial fiber, leaving partially to fully obstructed microchannels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). The polymerization front does not propagate in gels with \u03b10 \u2265 0.40 due to the reduced heat released during FP and heat loss to the glass mold."

                        "To gain insight into the tandem vascularization process, we developed a coupled thermochemical model for the thermal field (T), the degree of cure (\u03b1) of DCPD, and the degree of depolymerization (\u03b2) of PPC. The reaction-diffusion model38 was implemented in a transient, nonlinear finite-element solver (see \u201cMethods\u201d section). Successful curing and depolymerization are numerically defined by \u03b1 \u2265 0.90 and \u03b2 \u2265 0.90, respectively. The simulation shown in Fig.\u00a02c predicts localized deceleration of the polymerization front near the sacrificial template and a spatial delay in vascularization with respect to the location of the front, which are observed experimentally in Fig.\u00a02a. The computational results reveal that these observations are the consequence of the time required for heat to transfer from the cured pDCPD into the PPC template for endothermic depolymerization. The Vfront and Tfront predictions for different \u03b10 also match closely with experiments in the presence of the glass molds (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). The model predicts successful curing and vascularization for \u03b10 = 0.25, while also predicting unsuccessful vascularization due to incomplete depolymerization of PPC for \u03b10 = 0.35 (Fig.\u00a02d), as observed experimentally.",
                        "We further exploited this coupled thermochemical model to investigate the effect of a more insulating boundary condition (i.e., air) on the window for successful vascularization. Slightly higher Vfront and Tfront are predicted for an air boundary compared to a glass mold boundary (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010). The lower convective heat loss to air compared to the conduction-driven heat loss to the glass mold allows longer heat retention in the matrix after FP, thereby extending the window for vascularization to \u03b10 \u2264 0.35 and the window for front propagation to \u03b10 \u2264 0.50. To compare these predictions with experiments, elastomeric DCPD gels with \u03b10 > 0.20 containing sacrificial fibers are removed from the molds and subjected to FP. The Vfront and Tfront measurements along with the successful vascularization regime agree with the calculations from the model and the cooling profile of the matrix after FP is substantially slower (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c). The model successfully captures the thermochemical competition between the heat generated by the host matrix, the heat consumed by the depolymerizing fiber, and the heat lost to the surroundings, which determine the successful fabrication of vascular structures."

                        "Our concurrent vascularization strategy offers excellent control over the matrix and microchannel architecture. Incubating the resin at RT to obtain viscoelastic gels proves advantageous for passive and dynamic modulation of the microchannel architecture. A range of complex vascular structures (Fig.\u00a03a\u2013f) is easily fabricated from elastomeric DCPD gels containing sacrificial PPC (1% PAG) templates. A 3D helical microchannel is created in pDCPD from a heat-set PPC template (Fig.\u00a03a, b). \u03bcCT reconstruction of the microchannel reveals excellent dimensional and morphological fidelity. A flat gel with a straight fiber is bent into a horseshoe shape prior to FP without fracturing the template and this shape is preserved in the resulting microchannel (Fig.\u00a03c). Further, this vascularization process also enables in situ modulation of the vascular geometry by applying oscillatory strain to a gel with a sacrificial template during FP (Fig.\u00a03d and Supplementary Video\u00a02). The polymerization front permanently sets the instantaneous out-of-plane deformation experienced by the gel and the fiber during each loading cycle (Fig.\u00a03e). The pitch and amplitude of the channel are tuned by controlling the oscillation frequency (Fig.\u00a03f). Such control over vascular features may find use in particle/cell separation40 or mixing of multiple fluids via non-laminar flow26.Fig. 3Advanced manufacturing of microvascular structures.a\u2013f On-demand modulation of the vascular architecture in free-standing elastomeric DCPD gels (\u03b10 = 0.25). a Optical image of a helical sacrificial template (diameter\u00a0= 384\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009\u03bcm) embedded in a DCPD gel prior to FP. b \u03bcCT reconstruction of the resulting microchannel (diameter\u00a0= 404\u2009\u00b1\u200912\u2009\u03bcm) filled with a radiocontrast fluid for the sample region encompassed by the dashed box in a. c Microchannel inside a horseshoe-shaped pDCPD structure traces the curvature of the matrix. d\u2013f Concurrent polymerization and vascularization under oscillatory loading create sinusoidal microchannels.

                        "Vascularized carbon-fiber-reinforced composites with circular microchannels are also rapidly manufactured with the FP-based method (Fig.\u00a03g and Supplementary Table\u00a05). The presence of the fiber reinforcement exacerbates the thermochemical competition between FP and VaSC processes due to the decreased resin volume, resulting in lower front temperatures38. Additional PAG is added to the PPC fibers to accelerate the depolymerization kinetics and achieve complete mass loss at lower temperatures (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). PPC (3% PAG) fibers are sandwiched between layers of carbon-fiber fabric, then the fabric layup is infused with a liquid DCPD monomer. Briefly powering a resistive heating mat underneath the impregnated fabric stack triggers FP through the thickness of the laminate and facilitates longer heat retention in the cured composite, which ensures complete depolymerization of the sacrificial fiber. The fabrication time and energy are reduced by three and four orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to conventional curing and vascularization of similar size samples in an oven (Supplementary Table\u00a02). We anticipate even more significant energy savings for larger components. For traditional autoclave cure and vaporization of templates at high temperature, energy consumption scales directly with part size36,38. In great contrast, the required energy input per unit volume for FP-mediated processing actually decreases with increasing component size38."

                        "Scaling of the vascularization process for larger structures and fabrication of more complex networks will require addressing several challenges. Currently, the architectural complexity is limited by the resolution and capability of the 3D printing process for the sacrificial templates. Our experiments and modeling reveal that the total heat available for depolymerization is dictated by the enthalpy of FP, the thermal conductance at the boundaries, the surrounding temperature, and the placement of the sacrificial templates. Templates that are placed near the surfaces of the host thermoset or composite will experience faster heat loss to the surroundings compared to the center, which could impede the formation of clear microchannels. Monomers with higher enthalpy of FP can increase the heat available for depolymerization. Alternatively, replacing metallic tooling surfaces with more thermally insulating materials such as rigid polyisocyanurate foams will prolong heat retention in large structures and aid complete depolymerization. The maximum size of a template and the irradiation time are dictated by the dimensions and the intensity of the UV lamp, respectively. We envision a narrowband LED source with a higher intensity for continuous irradiation of the fiber during spooling to circumvent these limitations. The maximum thickness of the templates that undergo complete depolymerization depends on sufficient activation of the PAG. Short-wave UV irradiation may not penetrate well through templates thicker than 600 \u03bcm, leading to an insufficient amount of activated PAG. Adding a photosensitizer to extend the absorption window to longer wavelengths will be beneficial in overcoming this challenge. The experimental methods and computational tools that we have developed can be used to investigate these different design parameters and help build a library of compatible host resins and sacrificial components for synchronized fabrication of large-scale vascular structures.",
                        "We have successfully exploited the frontal polymerization of a structural host matrix in tandem with the depolymerization of a sacrificial template to create a range of vascular structures in a rapid, energy-efficient single-step process. Excellent control over the microchannel shape, size, and complexity was achieved with orthogonally triggered sacrificial templates. Vascularization of thermosets with interconnected microchannels was achieved within a few minutes under ambient conditions with energy savings of six orders of magnitude over competing techniques. Our thermochemical model successfully captures the competition between the reaction enthalpy of the host matrix, the energy consumed during template depolymerization, and the energy dissipated into the surroundings. The model provides a promising tool for the design of host matrix and sacrificial components for FP-based synchronized manufacturing of vascular structures. Tandem polymerization and vascularization will propel the use of high-performance vascular structures by reducing the energetic and temporal footprint for fabrication by several orders of magnitude."

The channel fidelity and void content in the cured composite are measured by polishing the cross sections of samples cut along the panel, then imaging the polished surfaces via a digital optical microscope (VHX-5000, Keyence). ImageJ software is used to measure the circularity of the channel and to calculate the ratio of void to cross-sectional area for each polished sample. The composite fiber volume fraction, Vf, is calculated using Eq.\u00a04:\\(V_{f} = \\frac{f_{A}n}{\\rho_{f}z}\\) where fA is the areal weight of the fabric, \u03c1f is the fiber density, n is the number of plies, and z is the composite thickness."
