### Targeted Disruption of the Centrin Gene Leads to Amastigote Stage Specific Attenuation of Growth in Leishmania donovani

- generate LdCEN null L. donovani promastigotes using homologous recombination
- delete both alleles of centrin gene using hyg and neo constructs
- confirm deletion of centrin by PCR, Southern blot, Northern blot, and Western blot analyses
- show LdCEN−/− promastigotes grow normally, but axenic amastigotes do not
- demonstrate centrin is required for basal body duplication in axenic amastigotes
- show LdCEN−/− axenic amastigotes accumulate at G2/M stage of cell cycle
- observe LdCEN−/− axenic amastigotes form large cell aggregates with multiple nuclei
- demonstrate LdCEN−/− axenic amastigotes undergo programmed cell death
- show LdCEN−/− parasites do not survive in macrophages
- observe LdCEN−/− parasites become multinucleated in macrophages
- demonstrate reversal of growth inhibition by centrin expression in LdCEN−/− parasites
- show centrin re-expression restores normal growth and morphology in LdCEN−/− axenic amastigotes
- conclude centrin is essential for growth and survival of L. donovani axenic amastigotes
