The device is based on a MOS design in the telecomm O, E, S, C, L, U-band wavelengths. Through active tuning of the carrier concentration of a nanometer-thin indium tin oxide (ITO) layer sandwiched inside the MOS structure, an active three-waveguide switch for transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light is enabled. Classical weak optical coupling (such as waveguide-to-waveguide) is strongly enhanced by the deep-subwavelength optical mode of the hybridized plasmons, i.e. the plasmonic MOS mode [13-16]. The switching functionality is achieved by the ITO's capability of changing its imaginary part of the refractive index by several orders of magnitude, shifting the effective index of the optical mode and hence altering the modal overlap between neighbouring waveguides [16].",

                        "Reference to the drawings illustrating various views of exemplary embodiments of the present invention is now made. In the drawings and the description of the drawings herein, certain terminology is used for convenience only and is not to be taken as limiting the embodiments of the present invention. Furthermore, in the drawings and the description below, like numerals indicate like elements throughout.",
                        "Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C, there are illustrated various views of a photonic router or electro-optic switch, generally designated as 100, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The switch 100 comprises a semiconductor oxide substrate 110 and three waveguides, including a first end waveguide 120, a second end waveguide 130, and a center waveguide 140. Optical light signals travel through the waveguides 120, 130, 140 carrying data. The switch 100 is a 2\u00d72 switch, whereby the center waveguide 140 switches light signals between the two end waveguides so that the light signals travel within one of the end waveguides 120, 130 or passes from one of the waveguides 120, 130 to the other of the waveguides 120, 130. The substrate 110 is a low dielectric layer that serves as a substrate cladding, such as SiO2 or Al2O3. The substrate 110 can be a Silicon \u201chandle\u201d wafer, and the entire starting structure is called SOI=silicon-on-insulator, with the 2(3) Si waveguides are the top epitaxial silicon layers. However, other suitable structures can be used, such as III-V or II-VI semiconductor structures.",
                        "The first end waveguide 120 has a height, h1, and a width, w1; the second end waveguide 130 has a height, h2, and a width, w2; and the center waveguide 140 has a height, h3, and a width, W3. In an exemplary embodiment, the end waveguides 120 and 130 are formed from silicon, and the semiconductor oxide substrate 110 is formed from SiO2. In a further exemplary embodiment, h1 and h2 are each 250 nm, and w1 and w2 are each 450 nm. In one embodiment, h1 and h2 are not less than 220 nm, which is the cut-off at \u03bb=1310 nm, and 250 is the value for light going through. However, other suitable dimensions can be utilized within the spirit and scope of the invention.",
                        "As shown, the center waveguide 140 is disposed on the substrate 110 between the two end waveguides 120, 130. Each of the waveguides 120, 130, 140 is elongated, with a length that is substantially greater than the width and height, and each has a respective longitudinal axis that extends along the length of the respective waveguide. The waveguides 120, 130, 140 are arranged to be parallel to one another, with the longitudinal axis of each waveguide 120, 130, 140 being parallel to the longitudinal axis of each other waveguide 120, 130, 140. The center waveguide 140 is separated from the first end waveguide 120 by a gap 125 of width, g1, and from the send end waveguide 130 by a gap 135 of width, g2. The center waveguide 140, therefore, is an \u201cisland\u201d between the two end waveguides 120, 130. In an exemplary embodiment, the center waveguide 140 is substantially centered between the two end waveguides 120, 130. Thus, the gap 125 of width, g1 is equal to the gap 135 of width, g2.",
                        "As best shown in FIG. 2C, each of the waveguides 120, 130, 140 has two transverse ends, two longitudinal sides, a top and a bottom. The switch 100 is, therefore, a 2\u00d72 switch for switching light input at either of the two inputs 121, 131 to either of the two outputs 122, 132. The traverse ends include a first transverse end 121, 131 and a second transverse end 122, 132 opposite the first end 121, 131, respectively. And the longitudinal sides include a first side 123, 133 opposite a second side 124, 134, respectively. Thus, the first waveguide 120 has a first end footling an input 121 and a second end forming an output 122 for TM polarized light, and the second waveguide 130 has a first end forming an input 131 and a second end forming an output 132 for TM polarized light. The center waveguide 140 has a first transverse end 141 and a second transverse end 142 opposite the first end, and a first longitudinal side 143 opposite a second longitudinal side 144.",
                        "Each of the waveguides 120, 130, 140 has a rectangular shape and is arranged parallel to one another. Accordingly, the sides 123, 124, 133, 134, 143, 144 each lie in a respective plane, and the planes are parallel to each other. In addition, one side 124 of the first waveguide 120 faces the first side 143 of the center waveguide 140, and one side 133 of the second waveguide 130 faces the second side 144 of the center waveguide 140. And as best shown in FIG. 2C, the center waveguide 140 is substantially shorter in length than the length of the two end waveguides 120, 130. The center waveguide 140 is arranged to at least partially overlap with each of the two end waveguides 120, 130, and can be centered with respect to the lengths of the one or both of the end waveguides 120, 130. Though the end waveguides 120, 130 are shown to have equal lengths and are aligned with one another in the embodiment of FIG. 2C, they can have different lengths or can be offset from one another. The end waveguides 120, 130 can have the same height and width as shown. The dimensions of the center waveguide 140 will be discussed in more detail below, but the center waveguide 140 can have any suitable length, height and width, including that the height is greater (FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B) and the width is smaller (FIG. 2C) than that of the two end waveguides 120, 130. The height of the center waveguide (145) improves the switch performance; that is, the optical mode profile overlap (i.e. the electric field density) between the two waveguide busses (i.e. 120, 130) with the local optical mode profile of the system comprised by the island region (i.e. 145-148) is better when the physical height of layer 145 is lower relative to the height of waveguides 120, 130. This so called \u2018detuning\u2019 increases the mode profile overlap and hence strengthens the interaction of the global optical system (i.e., optical supermodes).",
                        "Referring to FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, the two end waveguides 120, 130 are a single layer of a single homogeneous material, though any suitable waveguides can be provided. The center waveguide 140 has a bottom layer 145, two middle layers 146, 147, and a top layer 148, stacked one on top of another. The bottom layer 145 can he a high dielectric layer 145 such as a semiconductor, the first middle layer 146 can be a Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) layer 146 such as an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), the second middle layer 147 can be an low dielectric layer 147 such as a semiconductor oxide, and the top layer can be a metal. Thus, the metal layer 148 is positioned over the oxide layer 147, which is positioned over the ITO/TCO oxide layer 146, which is positioned over the dielectric layer 145. The layers 145, 146, 147, 148 have the same width and length as each other, so that each layer covers the entire adjacent layer. A first electrode 162 is coupled to the semiconductor layer 145 or TCO layer, and a second electrode 164 is coupled to the metal layer 148. Active switching in the device 100 between the inputs 121, 131 and the outputs 122, 132 occurs at the center island 140 in the control of a bias voltage or the absence of a bias voltage bias applied thereto, specifically via the electrodes 162, 164. In one embodiment, the semiconductor layer 145 has a height equal to or less than that of the two end waveguides h1 and h2; the TCO layer 146 thickness is in the range of about 10 nm to 80 nm; the height of the oxide layer 147 is determined based on the equation discussed below; and the metal layer 148 has a height of about 100 nm.",
                        "The layered configuration of the center waveguide 140 forms a MOS capacitor comprising the layers 145, 146, 147, and 148, which allows an electronic accumulation region to form at the interface between the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 and the semiconductor oxide layer 147 upon the application of a voltage bias between the metal layer 148 and the silicon layer 145 via the respective electrodes 162, 164.",
                        "In an exemplary alternative embodiment of the waveguide 140, the electrode 162 is coupled to the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 rather than to the silicon layer 145 to avoid additional optical losses of highly-doped semiconductors. In this configuration, when a voltage bias is provided between the metal layer 148 and the transparent conducting oxide layer 146, the electronic accumulation layer is still formed at the interface between the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 and the oxide layer 147. In this configuration, the MOS capacitor comprises the layers 146, 147, and 148. In another embodiment of the invention, the electrode 162 can be coupled to the ITO layer. However, it is desirable to have ITO in the optical low-loss state for no applied voltage. This state has the downside of being electrically of high resistance, which increases the contact resistance, which leads to high voltages and low modulation speeds. However, a selective Oxygen plasma treatment of ITO can make the ITO being low-resistive at any selected contact regions.",
                        "In accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the waveguide 140, the semiconductor layer 145 is formed from silicon; the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 is formed from ITO; the oxide layer 147 is formed from SiO2; and the metal layer 148 is formed from aluminum. Upon applying a voltage bias between the aluminum layer 148 and the silicon layer 145 via the respective electrodes 162, 164, the electronic accumulation layer forms at the ITO 146-SiO2 147 interface. In an exemplary variation on this embodiment, the electrode 162 is coupled to the ITO layer 146. In this configuration, when a voltage bias is provided between the metal layer 148 and the ITO layer 146, the electronic accumulation layer is still formed at the interface between the ITO layer 146 and the SiO2 layer 147. Alternatively, the electrodes 162, 164 can be placed at the TCO layer (146) and the metal layer (148). The relative placement position of the electrodes 162, 164 along the x-axis is not critical.",
                        "In each of the exemplary embodiments of the waveguide 140 discussed above, the MOS capacitor formed in the waveguide 140 offers a strong optical confinement, which is significantly below the diffraction limits of light, and strong electrostatics, such that a low bias voltage is needed to switch the device 100. When the waveguide 140 is unbiased, the effective index of the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 causes it to be a dielectric, in accordance with the following:",

                        "The center waveguide 140 selectively controls the direction of light that enters the end waveguides 120, 130. For instance as illustrated in FIG. 2C, light that enters the input end 121 of the first waveguide can travel in first direction shown by dashed line 150 along the entire length of the first waveguide 120 to the output end 122. And, light entering the input end 131 of the second waveguide 130 can travel along the entire length of the second waveguide 130 to the output end 132. The waveguides 120, 130 are not coupled, i.e., they are decoupled, when light enters the input port 121 and exits the waveguide 120 at the output port 122, or when light enters the input port 131 and exits the waveguide 130 at the output port 132. When the waveguides 120, 130 are not coupled, the device 100 is deemed to be in a bar state.",
                        "Alternatively, the light entering the input end 121 can travel in second direction 152. Here, the waveguides 120, 130 are coupled when light enters the input port 121 of the first end waveguide 120, crosses over to the second end waveguide 130 through the center waveguide 140, and exits the second end waveguide 130 at the output port 132. Or, light enters the input port 131 of the second end waveguide 130 and crosses over to the first end waveguide 120 through the enter waveguide 140, and exits the first end waveguide 120 at the output port 122. When the waveguides 120, 130 are coupled, the device 100 is deemed to be in a cross state.",
                        "Coupling is achieved when the device 100 is unbiased. Thus, FIG. 2C illustrates a path 152 that the light takes between the input port 121 and the output port 132 when the waveguides 120, 130 are coupled when the device is unbiased. FIG. 2C also illustrates a path 150 that the light takes between the input port 121 and the output port 122 when the waveguides 120, 130 are decoupled when the device is biased.",
                        "An eigenmode analysis approach is adopted at plane A\u2032 in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2A to map-out and optimize the coupling performance of the device 100. In the eigenmode simulation, there are five supermodes; two are TE polarized light that are ignored here as both effective indices do only marginally change with a voltage bias, and three TM polarized supermodes (two symmetric modes, TM1 and TM2, and an anti-symmetric mode TM3) are of interest to this analysis.",
                        "Thus, by controlling the voltages applied to the electrodes 162, 164, the center waveguide 140 controls whether the light entering the input 121 travels along the first path 150 and exits the output 122 or crosses over the center waveguide 140 and exits the output 132. When a voltage is applied to the electrodes 162, 164, the device 100 is biased because the loss coefficient of the ITO layer 146 increases, which makes the center waveguide 140 a quasi \u201creflector\u201d, and the light travels along the first path 150 and exits the output 122. When there is no voltage, the device 100 is unbiased, the center waveguide 140 is considered as a dielectric, and the light travels along the second path 152 and exits the output 132.",
                        "The function description of each individual layer of the island region is as follows, and can be divided into an electrical and an optical analysis. Electrically, layers 145, 147, and 148 form an MOS capacitor, whereas layer 147 is the electron flow prohibiting layer. Here layer 146 is the active material layer, whose carrier concentration is changed due to an accumulation of electrons. Optically, the island forms a hybrid plasmon polariton waveguide mode. The benefits of this mode for the switch are that the light is squeezed into a sub diffraction-limited area, which in turn enhances the light matter interaction of the system. This results in a strong optical index modulation of 146, which also alters the local island mode and the global supermode. The latter determines the overall switch performance (i.e. bar and cross states).",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 6, there is illustrated a method 600 of optimizing the coupling performance of the device 100, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The optimization method in analyzing the device 100 is performed follows:",

The Step 610 comprises two sub-steps 612 and 614.

In one embodiment, the length of the center waveguide 140 is shorter or equal to that of the end waveguides 120, 130, though any suitable length can be provided. One objective of the device is to operate at (a) a small on-chip footprint, and (b) with low electrical power consumption. Both are affected by the physical device length. For (b), the device length relates to an electrical capacitance, which in turn relates to the average energy consumption of the device with Energy/bit=\u00bd CV2, where C is the electrical capacitance and V the applied voltage. C, however, relates to the capacitance formed by 148 and 146 (or 145), and is proportional to the area spanned by the area in the xy-plane by the layers connected to the electrodes. In summary, the shortness of the device length, Le. the length of the island 140, relates directly to the usefulness of the device.",
                        "(ii) Analyze the effect of changing the widths, g1 and g2, of the gaps 125, 135, Step 620. Reducing the size of gap 125, 135 may produce undesired coupling from the end waveguides 120, 130 directly without going through the center waveguide 140. Conversely, increasing of the size of the gaps 125, 135 leads to weaker coupling. Hence the required coupling length, L, increases monotonically, as shown in FIG. 3A. Furthermore, the coupling length, L, of the bar state increases faster than that for the cross state, which introduces the basis of the switching behavior of the device 100. An explanation for this phenomenon is two-fold. First, the refractive index of the transparent conducting oxide layer 146 changes due to the bias applied to the island 140 altering the propagation constant of the supermode, preferably inside the island 140. Second, the optical loss of the island 140 is significantly increased. Thus, the island 140 part acts as a metal-like reflector, keeping the incoming light in the waveguide 120.",
                        "(iii) Analyze the effect of the width, w3, of the waveguide 140 (FIG. 3B) and the height, h3, of the silicon layer 145 (FIG. 3C), Step 630. Note, the height, h3, and width, w3, of the silicon layer 145 relative to that of the waveguides 120 or 130 is a \u201clever\u201d in the device 100, and this difference of the geometrical height, h3, and width, w3, is referred to as \u201cdetuning.\u201d The height, h3, of the silicon layer 145 need not be the same as the height, h1, of the waveguide 120 or the height, h2, of the waveguide 130. Detuning the height, h3, of the silicon layer 145 would give an even higher coupling length, L, ratio. This indicates that if the height, h3, of the silicon layer 145 would be lowered below the cut-off wavelength of the waveguide 140, more of the electric field would sit in the plasmonic section, which lower the effective index of the cross state, to produce the larger effective index change. The optical MOS mode has a tight optical confinement overlapping with the TCO (number) and Oxide layer 148. Modal overlap is preferred to light passing through without applied bias between the electrodes 162, 164. In one embodiment the TCO layer 147 absorbs or reflects the light back to end waveguide 120 with bias between the electrodes 162, 164.",

FIG. 5A shows a cross state without a voltage bias. Accordingly, the light is shown crossing from the first waveguide 120, through the center waveguide 140, to the second waveguide 130, and exiting the second waveguide 130. Referring jointly to FIG. 2C and FIG. 5, the light exits out of the longitudinal side 124 (toward the front end 121 in the embodiment shown) that faces the center waveguide 140. The center waveguide 140 is positioned with respect to first waveguide 120 so that the light enters the first longitudinal side 143 of the center waveguide 140 (toward the front end 141 in the embodiment shown), and exits through the second longitudinal side 144 of the center waveguide 140 (toward the rear end 142 in the embodiment shown). The light then passes into the second end waveguide 130 through the first longitudinal side 133 (toward the output end 132 in the embodiment shown). Of course, any suitable configuration can be provided, and the light can exit and enter along any part of the length of the waveguides 120. 130, 140.

                        "Wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM), one data and signal routing scheme in optical communications, has been established as a desired means of delivering high-data bandwidths. In order to prevent device failure caused by an individual resonator-based design, a spectrum analysis by scanning the wavelengths from 1.30 to 1.85 micrometer is applied for testing broadband operation performance. The optimized extinction ratio of 21 dB at the cross state and 7.3 dB at the bar state is observed at 1.55 \u03bcm wavelength, respectively. It gives a promising L ratio of 35 and above for a 400 nm bandwidth. Thus, the device 100 offers to comply with the future requirement for the applications of WDM architectures.",
                        "Important performance figures of the electro-optic (EO) switch 100 are operating efficiency (E/hit) and bandwidth (i.e. speed). Both may be optimized by varying different geometric parameters of the device 100. Compared with a conventional Mach-Zehnder or ring structure-based optical switch, the switch 100 is more compact at a length range in between 4.8 to 5.5 \u03bcm, which is about 100 times more compact than current devices, and the insertion loss can be as low as 1.52 dB. Furthermore, the speed performance is estimated up to THz switching by calculating the RC delay time for the waveguide 140 with a resistive load of 50 \u03c9 to 500 \u03c9. The energy per bit is low as 8.98 fJ. Thus, the device 100 has high potential application for ultra-compact photonic integrated circuits and data routing. In an exemplary embodiment, the switch 100 is connected and integrated seamlessly to a low-cost data-routing silicon-on-insulator platform.",

The gate oxide thickness varies from 5 to 25 nm. The bandwidth (BW) is calculated from BW=1/RC where R has values from 50 to 500 Ohm. Energy per bit (E/bit) is calculated by E/bit=\u00bd CV2, where applied voltage is 1 to 2 V and 2 to 3 V for graphene and ITO, respectively.",
                        "The invention is described as controlling a light signal passing from one of the inputs 121, 131 to one of the outputs 122, 132. It should be recognized however, that the center waveguide 140 can also control light traveling in reverse from the output side 122, 132 (which is now an input side) to one of the input sides 121, 131 (which is now an output side), such as along paths 150, 152. In addition, light can travel along the paths 150, 152 at the same time or at different times. Thus, for instance, light can travel from input 121 to output 122 at the same time light travels from input 131 to output 122. Or, light can travel from output 122 to input 131 at the same time light travels from input 121 to output 132. In addition, while only a single center waveguide 140 is shown, there can be multiple center waveguides. And, while the invention is shown and described as being a 2\u00d72 switch, other size switches are within the spirit and scope of the invention, such as a cascaded 3\u00d73 switch or a 2\u00d73 switch. And, the switch 100 can be utilized for symmetric and anti-symmetric waveguide coupling.",
                        "As shown and described, the center waveguide 140 as the control node of the switch is constructed by four layers 145, 146, 147, 148, which are provided in the designated order and arrangement. However, other suitable number of layers can be provided and for instance additional layers can be added to the center waveguide 140. For instance, one more oxide layer can be added in between the bottom layer 145 and the TCO layer 146 as passivation.",
                        "The performance of the switch is quantified by three parameters; physical footprint, modulation speed capability (i.e. device delay), and electrical power consumed (i.e. energy/bit). In all metrics the device 100 are an improvement. As mentioned above, in one embodiment of the invention, the two end waveguides 120 and 130 have the height h1 and h2 equals to 250 nm and width w1 and w2 equal to 450 nm. Layers 145, 146, 147, 148 in the center waveguide 140 share a width w3 equal to 300 nm. The bottom layer 145 in the center waveguide 140 obtains a height less than 250 nm, and 160 nm is preferred. The thickness of the ITO/TCO layer 146 is in the range of 10 nm-80 nm, and 80 nm is preferred. The oxide layer 147 varies from 5-25 nm, with 5 nm being preferred. The metal layer 148 is preferred to be 100 nm. For all of these preferred values, the switch 100 with a length of 5.03 \u03bcm produces an insertion loss of 1.52 dB and extinction ratio of 21 dB when light going through path 152, and an insertion loss of 2.94 dB and extinction ratio of 7.31 dB when light going through path 150 at a speed of 1.0 THz to 10.0 THz. The energy per bit is 8.98 fJ. The insertion loss is improved, which the island 140 bears higher optical losses per length compared to state-of-the-art devices, which are typically pure photonic vs. plasmonic here). the actual physical length of the device 100 is significantly shorter, thus the absolute loss is reduced by factors ranging between about 2-10. In another embodiment of the invention, the island 140 layers 145-148 can be flipped around in the z-direction, i.e. the island 140 starts from the bottom with a metal layer and ends at the top with a high dielectric layer.",
                        "It is noted that the switch 100 is especially useful in computing and networking hardware, such as network-on-chip designs (i.e. inter-core), or in optical communication links within a processing element (i.e. intra-core). However, other suitable applications can be made, within the spirit and scope of the invention.",
