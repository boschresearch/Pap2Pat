    "abstract": "Genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems is often difficult using conventional methods. Here, we describe a mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns (MoDMP) pipeline to address this problem in three difficult-to-transform bacterial strains. Twenty-four putative DNA methyltransferases (MTases) from these difficult-to-transform strains were cloned and expressed in an Escherichia coli strain lacking all of the known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thirteen of these MTases exhibited DNA modification activity in Southwestern dot blot or Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) assays. The active MTase genes were assembled into three operons using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA assembler and were co-expressed in the E. coli strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases. Thereafter, results from the dot blot and restriction enzyme digestion assays indicated that the DNA methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform strains are mimicked in these E. coli hosts. The transformation of the Gram-positive Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TA208 and B. cereus ATCC 10987 strains with the shuttle plasmids prepared from MoDMP hosts showed increased efficiencies (up to four orders of magnitude) compared to those using the plasmids prepared from the E. coli strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases or its parental strain. Additionally, the gene coding for uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp) was directly inactivated using non-replicative plasmids prepared from the MoDMP host in B. amyloliquefaciens TA208. Moreover, the Gram-negative chemoautotrophic Nitrobacter hamburgensis strain X14 was transformed and expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Finally, the sequence specificities of active MTases were identified by restriction enzyme digestion, making the MoDMP system potentially useful for other strains. The effectiveness of the MoDMP pipeline in different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This pipeline could facilitate the functional genomics of the strains that are difficult to transform.",

                "Experimental genetic manipulation has been an essential tool for gaining insight into the significance of bacterial metabolism, physiology and pathogenesis [1], [2] and has been instrumental in developing microbial biotechnology [3]. To date, only a limited proportion of the laboratory culturable bacterial species are amenable to genetic manipulation. Among these manipulation-friendly species, many strains are refractory to transformation by exogenous DNA. The currently available laboratory model species satisfied the research need for genetic uniformity, but the handicap in genetic manipulation is a challenge when exploring the unique traits of these non-model species/strains [4].",
                "Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems are composed of restriction enzymes (REases) and DNA methyltransferases (MTases). These systems are widespread in both bacteria and archaea. Approximately 95% of the genome-sequenced bacteria harbor R-M systems, and 33% carry more than four REases [5]. R-M systems have been classified into four groups depending on their subunit composition, cleavage sites, sequence specificity and cofactor requirement [6]. Type I, II and III REases cleave unmethylated DNA at specific sites, and Type IV cut methylated DNA with foreign patterns [6]. R-M systems are believed to act as defenses to protect the prokaryotic cells against invading DNA; exogenous DNA with foreign methylation patterns are recognized and rapidly degraded [7]. Inevitably, this defensive machinery hinders the experimental genetic manipulation of many bacteria species. Moreover, genetic modification becomes even more difficult when the targeted bacteria carry multiple R-M systems.",
                "The Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14 strain oxidizes nitrite to conserve energy and is commonly used in nitrification research [8]. Although the strain was isolated more than 100 years ago [9], limited research on this strain has been published due to the lack of genetic manipulation tools. Genomic sequencing has revealed eleven sets of R-M genes in N. hamburgensis X14 [10]. Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 is a non-lethal strain in the same genetic subgroup as B. anthracis [11]. Although genetic manipulation has been routine in many other B. cereus strains [12], limited research has been performed in B. cereus ATCC 10987 due to its resistance to genetic manipulation. Transformation of B. cereus ATCC 10987 has been performed with DNA prepared from Bacillus subtilis with low efficiency [13], [14], and four REases have recently been characterized [15]. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TA208 is an industrial guanosine-producing strain [16] and has been reported to be transformed at low efficiencies with plasmids prepared from Escherichia coli [17].",
                "Here, we describe a mimicking-of-DNA-methylation-patterns (MoDMP) pipeline. An E. coli strain lacking all of the known six characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases was generated to prevent unintentional modification of propagated plasmids or cleavage of DNA with foreign methylation patterns. After expressing multiple active MTases from the target bacteria in the E. coli strain lacking known R-M systems and orphan MTases, the DNA methylation patterns of E. coli were altered to reflect the patterns of the target bacteria. Plasmids prepared from these hosts escaped the host REases, and genetic manipulation could be readily achieved. The pipeline was shown to be effective in all of the three aforementioned strains which are difficult to transform using conventional methods. We report the first genetic transformation of Nitrobacter, the improvement of transformation efficiency by exogenous plasmids in B. cereus ATCC 10987 and B. amyloliquefaciens TA208 using the MoDMP pipeline, and direct mutagenesis using non-replicative plasmids in B. amyloliquefaciens TA208. The MoDMP pipeline may be readily adapted to bacteria carrying multiple R-M systems."

                        "To avoid the unintentional activation of the Type IV R-M systems in the target bacteria, plasmids that are to be used for genetic transformation should be prepared from an E. coli host that does not methylate DNA (dam- dcm- hsdRMS-). Moreover, the expression of MTases in E. coli would induce foreign patterns of modification on the E. coli chromosomal DNA; therefore, the REases that restrict methylated DNA (Mrr, McrA and MrcBC) should be inactivated in the MoDMP host. To date, three E. coli strains that do not methylate DNA or restrict DNA with foreign methylation patterns have been described (E. coli DB24 [18], E. coli HST04 from Clontech and E. coli JTU007 [19]). In this study, an E. coli mutant lacking all of the six characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases genes, namely strain EC135, was generated in the E. coli TOP10 background by deleting the dam and dcm genes. A wild-type recA allele was introduced into the strain prior to dam inactivation to counteract the inviability of the dam recA double mutant strain [20]. The construction of the E. coli EC135 strain is explained in detail in the Supporting Information Methods (Text S1), and validation of the strain is described in the Supporting Information Results (Text S1 and Figure S1)."

In the MoDMP procedure, MTases from the difficult-to-transform bacterial strains were used to protect DNA from being degraded by the REases. The genes of 24 putative MTases including two belonging to Type I R-M systems, 19 belonging to Type II R-M systems, two belonging to Type III R-M systems, and one orphan MTase were cloned from the genomes of the three difficult-to-transform strains into the pBAD43 vector (Table 1).",
                        "To date, three types of methyl-transferring activity have been described for bacterial DNA MTases, namely N6-methyladenine (m6A), N4-methylcytosine (m4C) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modifications. Dot blot assays were conducted to detect the modified bases in the total genomic DNA of the E. coli EC135 strains expressing individual MTase using antibodies against m6A, m4C and m5C. In total, 13 of the putative MTase genes exhibited methyl transfer activity to DNA (Figure 1), and the bases they modified are summarized in Table 1. The spots of the dot blots were also scanned and quantified, and the relative intensity of each spot is shown in Figure S2.",
                        "The hybridization signals of BCE_0392, Nham_0582, Nham_0803 and Nham_3225 were weak in the dot blot experiments. To confirm their activity, the total DNA of the E. coli EC135 strains expressing these four MTases individually were digested to deoxynucleosides, and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) assays were performed to detect N6-methyl-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) in the DNA. In High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF/MS) analysis, m6dA (m/z 266.12) was readily detected in the digested DNA of the BCE_0392-, Nham_0582- and Nham_3225-expressing strains in the MS spectrum at the corresponding retention time of standard m6dA, validating that BCE_0392, Nham_0582, and Nham_3225 displayed DNA m6A modification activity in E. coli (Figure 2). Xu et al. has reported that MTase activity was not detected for in vivo translated BCE_0392 protein using [H3]AdoMet and phage \u03bb DNA or pXbaI plasmid DNA as substrate [15]. This might either be caused by the mis-folding of in vivo translated BCE_0392 protein or by the absence of BCE_0392 recognition sites from the substrate DNA they used.",
                        "Although m6dA was not detected for Nham_0803 in the HPLC-QTOF/MS analysis (Figure 2), the MTase activity of Nham_0803 could not be ruled out, since the DNA of the Nham_0803-expressing strain displayed slight but noticeable signal increase compared with the E. coli EC135 strain harboring empty vector (Figure S2). Other more sensitive and targeted MS approaches could be useful in detecting the possible modified nucleoside conferred by Nham_0803 [21].",
                        "It is noteworthy that the E. coli strain EC135 expressing the Nham_0569 MTase grows much slower than the control strain or strains expressing other MTases (Nham_0803 and Nham_3225), and the final biomass of strain EC135 carrying Nham_0569 was about 60% of that for the control strains (Figure S3). This growth retardation in E. coli may be attributed to the toxicity of the Nham_0569 MTase. The E. coli EC135 strain lacks methylation-dependent REases activity, which will cleave its own DNA when foreign methylation patterns are detected, leading to cell death; however, the modification of m6A by the Nham_0569 MTase may occur on sequences overlapping with Dam sites in E. coli, which participates in DNA mismatch repair and replication initiation. Consequently, the premature and untimely methylation of DNA may interfere with strain proliferation [22]. Subsequent sequence specificity analysis has revealed that Nham_0569 modified GATC sequences (see below)."

                        "To mimic the DNA methylation patterns of the strains that are difficult to transform, we co-expressed the active MTases from each strain. By taking advantage of the high rates of recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MTase genes, with optimized ribosome binding site (RBS) for expression in E. coli, were inserted into the pWYE724 backbone to form three operons. The diagrams of the pMoDMP plasmids are shown in Figure 3. The insertion of the MTase genes was verified by multiple methods, including PCR analysis of plasmids, restriction digestion (Figure S4) and DNA sequencing. The protocol for DNA assembly in S. cerevisiae is very powerful, and up to eight MTase genes from Nitrosococcus oceani ATCC 19707 could be readily assembled in our lab (Zhang et al., unpublished).",
                        "DNA from the E. coli EC135 strain expressing multiple MTases was also tested by dot blot assay, with the DNA of the parent strains as the positive controls (Figure 4). DNA from the co-expression strains exhibited multiple methylation signals, indicating the alteration of the DNA methylation patterns in E. coli. It is worth noting that the m4C and m5C signals in B. amyloliquefaciens strain TA208, the m5C signal in B. cereus strain ATCC 10987 and the m4C signal in N. hamburgensis strain X14 were much weaker when compared with their corresponding MTase over-expressing E. coli strain. This signal weakness could be attributed to the different number of MTase target sequences between the genomic sequences of E. coli and the parent strains or to the fact that the B. amyloliquefaciens TA208 strain is an adenine auxotroph, which limits the availability of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). However, pMK4 plasmid DNA prepared from the TA208 strain is resistant to BamHI digestion, which is a homolog to the restriction subunit of the BAMTA208_16650-BAMTA208_16660 systems (see below). Thus, regulational expression of the R-M systems could also explain the weak blot signals in the parent strains; Hegna et al. has reported that the R-M system is activated when B. cereus is grown in the presence of exogenous DNA [23]."

Hence it may also be that the plasmids methylated at the Dam and Dcm sites would not be inherited in B. amyloliquefaciens TA208, e.g., methylated replication origin would not be bound by the replication protein. The MoDMP protocol increased the transformation efficiencies of all the plasmids tested in B. amyloliquefaciens TA208. The pMK4 plasmid from MoDMP hosts showed the highest transformation efficiency (3\u00d7106 CFU/\u00b5g DNA), representing a 104-fold increase compared to that of the plasmids from the E. coli EC135 strain. The MoDMP procedure also enabled two previously untransformable plasmids, pAD123 and pDG148StuI, to be transformed at an efficiency of 1\u00d7105 CFU/\u00b5g DNA (Figure 5A).",

The plasmids prepared from E. coli TOP10 and EC135 strains showed similar transformation efficiencies, indicating that the putative Type IV R-M systems (BCE_1016 and BCE_2317) in B. cereus ATCC 10987 may be inactive.

The B. amyloliquefaciens TA208 strain was transformed with pWYE748 plasmids that had been through the MoDMP host. The pWYE748 plasmid recombines with chromosome of B. amyloliquefaciens TA208 at the upp locus with a low rate (10\u22126) because it lacks a replication origin for Bacillus (Figure 6A). BS043 was obtained and PCR and sequencing analyses revealed the successful replacement of the upp gene with the chloramphenicol resistance gene in this strain (Figure 6B). Uracil phosphoribosyltransferase converts 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to 5-fluoro-UMP, which is ultimately metabolized to the toxic compound 5-fluoro-dUMP capable of inhibiting the activity of thymidylate synthetase. The upp/5-FU module has been widely used in many bacterial species for deletion of genes without introducing antibiotic resistance markers [26]. In contrast with the B. amyloliquefaciens TA208 strain, the BS043 strain could grow on minimal medium (MM) supplemented with 5-FU (Figure 6C). These findings suggest that the MoDMP system elevated transformation efficiencies of exogenous plasmid to enable direct gene inactivation, and the upp gene could be used as a counter-selection marker for the in-frame deletion of genes in B. amyloliquefaciens."

                        "The four active MTases from N. hamburgensis X14 provided DNA partial protection from cleavage by DpnI, DpnII, PvuII, SspI, SpeI, MfeI, NlaIII, AseI, HinfI and TfiI when co-expressed, and the genomic DNA of the N. hamburgensis X14 strain was sensitive to DpnII digestion, partially resistant to DpnI digestion and resistant to SpeI, AseI, HinfI and TfiI digestion (Figure S8B). These results indicated that Nham_0569 was only partially expressed in its native host.",
                        "The modification sequences of MTases are summarized to Table 1. The MoDMP hosts and difficult-to-transform bacteria showed similar DNA methylation patterns based on the REase digestion analysis, but the DNA from MoDMP hosts have more modification sites than corresponding difficult-to-transform bacteria. And this was mainly caused by the limited expression of some MTases in their native hosts, especially some prophage-derived MTases, i.e., BAMTA208_6525, BCE_0393 and Nham_0569, which are multi-specific MTases."

                "Genetic transformation of bacteria harboring multiple R-M systems has been problematic using conventional methods. It has been long recognized that the exogenous MTases over-expressed in E. coli could modify DNA in vivo and protect them from digestion by their cognate REases [31]. Strategies based on this fact have been developed to overcome the restriction barrier of bacteria, including in vitro or in vivo plasmid modification prior to transformation [32], [33], heat inactivation of the REases [34] or gene knock-outs [35]. However, it has been reported that the inactivation of the SauI Type I R-M system is insufficient for Staphylococcus aureus to efficiently accept foreign DNA [36]. In this study, a strategy has been developed to mimic the DNA methylation patterns of the difficult-to-transform bacteria in a modified E. coli strain. To achieve this goal, active MTases from the difficult-to-transform bacteria were co-expressed in an E. coli host lacking all of the characterized R-M systems and orphan MTases.",
                "The protocol for genetic transformation of difficult-to-transform bacteria using a plasmid prepared in a different E. coli host is diagramed in Figure S9. As indicated in strain B. amyloliquefaciens TA208, DNA from the E. coli hosts with Dam and Dcm contains methylated bases in GAmTC and CCmWGG sequences but is not methylated at the recognition sequences of the host Type I\u2013III REases; this DNA would then be recognized by Type I\u2013IV REases in the target bacteria (upper left panel in Figure S9). Plasmids prepared from dam dcm EcoKI mutant E. coli would make the strains transformable at a low efficiency due to the plasmids being able to avoid restriction by the Type IV REases in the target bacterium (lower left panel in Figure S9). Many bacterial species have been reported to restrict DNA containing Dam and Dcm methylation; for example, B. anthracis could be transformed by DNA from an E. coli dam dcm mutant strain but not by DNA from E. coli host strains with the wild type alleles [37], [38]. Additionally, DNA prepared from the E. coli SCS110 strain was more accessible to Corynebacterium glutamicum than DNA from E. coli hosts with Dam and Dcm [39]. However, not all difficult-to-transform bacteria behave like this. Bacteria lacking functional Type IV REases could be transformed by DNA prepared from E. coli hosts with Dam, Dcm or EcoKI, albeit at a low efficiency. Currently, it has been shown that the B. cereus ATCC 10987 strain does not restrict DNA with Dam and Dcm methylation. It has also been reported that the plasmids methylated in E. coli TOP10 cells using the MTases of the target bacteria can allow for the genetic manipulation of Bifidobacterium breve [40]. Ryan et al. showed that the bbe02 and bbq67 loci limited the transformation of Borrelia burgdorferi by shuttle vector DNA prepared from E. coli, irrespective of its Dam, Dcm or EcoKI methylation status [41]. The N. hamburgensis X14 strain used in this study may restrict DNA with Dcm methylation; the plasmid-borne putative Type IV R-M system Nham_4502-Nham_4503 has been annotated in the REBASE database [5], though its activity and specificity remain unclear.",
                "As shown in the upper right panel in Figure S9, expression of exogenous MTases in E. coli would result in methylation of chromosomal DNA, and Mrr, McrA and McrBC would recognize and cleave the DNA with foreign patterns, making the strain inviable or resulting in poor MTase expression [42], [43]. Therefore, an E. coli strain lacking all of the known R-M systems and orphan MTases was generated with MTases expressed. The plasmids prepared from this host could escape the REases that recognize unmethylated DNA or DNA methylated in foreign patterns (lower right panel in Figure S9). The MoDMP concept could greatly improve genetic transformation efficiency.",
                "Recently, four REases from the B. cereus ATCC 10987 strain have been cloned and characterized, namely BceSI, BceSII, BceSIII and BceSIV [15]. Only faint and non-specific hybridization blots were observed using the antibodies against m6A and m5C for the MTase of BceSI (BCE_1018) in this study; these faint blots may be caused by the vagaries of dot blot approaches. It might also be that BCE_1018 modifies the DNA in a way other than methylation, such as hydroxymethylation or glucosyl-hydroxymethylation. BCE_1018 was not included in the downstream MoDMP application. Nevertheless, the highest transformation efficiency was achieved using the plasmids modified by six other MTases and was within the acceptable range for gene knock-out experiments (107 CFU/\u00b5g DNA). This efficiency may be caused by the low abundance and the weak REase activity of BceSI in strain B. cereus ATCC 10987, as described by Hegna et al. [23]. BceSI was induced only when the strain B. cereus ATCC 10987 was grown in the presence of exogenous DNA.",
                "Nham_3845 (NhaXI) has been reported to be a fused enzyme harboring both restriction and modification subunits, but the m6A or m4C modification activity was not detected [44]; in this study the MTase activity was not detected either. It might be that Nham_3845 modified DNA in ways other than methylation, which could not be detected using immunoblot assays.",
                "The contribution of individual MTases to genetic transformation was not evaluated in this study because a shuttle plasmid containing all of the MTase recognition sequences cannot be defined. A MTase that does not modify one particular plasmid might be useful when other plasmids are to be used. Therefore, to make a universal system for all plasmids, all of the identified active MTases were employed for MoDMP. The orphan MTase BAMTA208_06715, which lacks a counterpart REase, was also used in the MoDMP pipeline of B. amyloliquefaciens TA208. Orphan MTases, such as CcrM, may participate in methylation-directed DNA mismatch repair [45]. Methylated DNA could potentially escape inspection from the host mismatch repair machinery and eventually exhibit an elevated transformation performance, hence the use of BAMTA208_06715 in the MoDMP pipeline.",
                "The use of DNA mimic protein Ocr (overcome classical restriction) alongside the plasmid (TypeOne Restriction Inhibitor, Epicentre; [46]) which specifically inhibits Type I REase activity, also enhances transformation efficiency in bacterial species [47]. Combination of this method with the MoDMP pipeline could further elevate transformation performance in strains which are difficult to transform. Recently, a novel R-M system has been shown to phosphorothioate DNA, preventing the degradation of the DNA by its REase counterparts [48]. The MoDMP concept may also be adapted to those bacteria restricting unphosphorothioated DNA.",
                "In conclusion, we devised a system in E. coli that mimics the DNA methylation patterns of bacterial strains harboring multiple R-M systems. Eventually, the R-M barrier of three represented bacterial strains were overcome, including Gram positive, Gram negative, chemoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs. The adaptability of this pipeline to different bacterial groups suggests a universal potential. This protocol is very fast; a MoDMP plasmid can be generated in less than one week using the S. cerevisiae assembler, if the MTase activity assay step is omitted and the putative MTases are cloned and expressed directly. We expect that the pipeline will be applicable to other strains of known genome sequence that are resistant to genetic transformation."
