    "abstract": "TGD2 proteins of Arabidopsis are proposed to be a substrate binding component of a lipid transfer complex in the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Loss of function of this protein or other components of this complex may disrupt the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-pathway of thylakoid lipid biosynthesis. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a minimal binding domain capable of specifically binding phosphatidic acid. Alternatively, the minimal binding domain may further comprise accessory binding domains that, in combination, create a complete TGD2 phosphatidic acid binding domain. Consequently, phosphatidic acid may be quantitatively detected from samples as described in the methods herein.",

For example, if a lipid is specific for tertiary structure \u201cA\u201d, the presence of a protein containing tertiary structure A (or free, unlabelled A) in a reaction containing labeled \u201cA\u201d, the lipid will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the lipid.",

More rarely, a variant may have \u201cnonconservative\u201d changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions (i.e., additions), or both. Guidance in determining which and how many amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted or deleted without abolishing biological or immunological activity may be found using computer programs including, but not limited to, DNAStar\u00ae software.",

These may be detected using a variety of methods (e.g., sequencing, hybridization assays etc.). Included within this definition are alterations to the genomic DNA sequence which encodes TGD2 (i.e., for example, SEQ ID NO:1), the inability of a selected fragment of SEQ ID NO:1 to hybridize under high stringency conditions to a sample of genomic DNA (e.g., using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes), and improper or unexpected hybridization, such as hybridization to a locus other than a wild type chromosomal locus (e.g., using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)).",

The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods which depend upon binding between nucleic acids.",
                        "The terms \u201chomology\u201d and \u201chomologous\u201d as used herein in reference to nucleotide sequences refer to a degree of complementarity with other nucleotide sequences. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A nucleotide sequence which is partially complementary, i.e., \u201csubstantially homologous,\u201d to a nucleic acid sequence is one that at least partially inhibits a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid sequence. The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (i.e., the hybridization) of a completely homologous sequence to a target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.",
                        "The terms \u201chomology\u201d and \u201chomologous\u201d as used herein in reference to amino acid sequences refer to the degree of identity of the primary structure between two amino acid sequences. Such a degree of identity may be directed a portion of each amino acid sequence, or to the entire length of the amino acid sequence. Two or more amino acid sequences that are \u201csubstantially homologous\u201d may have at least 50% identity, preferably at least 75% identity, more preferably at least 85% identity, most preferably at least 95%, or 100% identity.",
                        "As used herein, the term \u201cprimer\u201d refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product which is complementary to a nucleic acid strand is induced, (i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and an inducing agent such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH). The primer is preferably single stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification, but may alternatively be double stranded. If double stranded, the primer is first treated to separate its strands before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxy-ribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method.",
                        "DNA molecules are said to have \u201c5\u2032 ends\u201d and \u201c3\u2032 ends\u201d because mononucleotides are reacted to make oligonucleotides in a manner such that the 5\u2032 phosphate of one mononucleotide pentose ring is attached to the 3\u2032 oxygen of its neighbor in one direction via a phosphodiester linkage. Therefore, an end of an oligonucleotide is referred to as the \u201c5\u2032 end\u201d if its 5\u2032 phosphate is not linked to the 3\u2032 oxygen of a mononucleotide pentose ring. An end of an oligonucleotide is referred to as the \u201c3\u2032 end\u201d if its 3\u2032 oxygen is not linked to a 5\u2032 phosphate of another mononucleotide pentose ring. As used herein, a nucleic acid sequence, even if internal to a larger oligonucleotide, also may be said to have 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. In either a linear or circular DNA molecule, discrete elements are referred to as being \u201cupstream\u201d or 5\u2032 of the \u201cdownstream\u201d or 3\u2032 elements. This terminology reflects the fact that transcription proceeds in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 fashion along the DNA strand. The promoter and enhancer elements which direct transcription of a linked gene are generally located 5\u2032 or upstream of the coding region. However, enhancer elements can exert their effect even when located 3\u2032 of the promoter element and the coding region. Transcription termination and polyadenylation signals are located 3\u2032 or downstream of the coding region.",

Promoters and enhancers consist of short arrays of DNA sequences that interact specifically with cellular proteins involved in transcription. Maniatis, T. et al., Science 236:1237 (1987).

The data presented herein, demonstrates that the binding of DsRed-TGD2C to PA displays positive cooperativity with a Hill number of 5.8 and the apparent Kd of 39.81 mol % PA (wt/wt). Further data presented herein, utilized deletion and truncation mutagenesis to identify a 25 amino acid TGD2C segment as a specific PA minimal binding domain.",
                        "The task of studying lipid-protein interactions is difficult due to the hydrophobicity property of the interacting molecules. Moreover, there are few reliable quantitative techniques available to assess specific binding kinetics and each method has its own limitations. Therefore, the present invention overcame these limitations by utilizing: (1) a protein-lipid overlay assay for rapid detection and qualitative assessment of binding; and (2) a liposome-association assay combined with densitometry quantification to evaluate relative binding between proteins. Together, these methods allow us to identify a specific binding domain and evaluate it semi-quantitatively."

                                "As plant leaves expand, the demand on the lipid biosynthetic machinery is high because leaf cells contain one of the most extensive membrane systems found in Nature, for example, a chloroplast photosynthetic thylakoid membrane. Chloroplast thylakoid lipids include, but are not limited to, nonphosphorous galactolipids.",
                                "Galactolipid biosynthesis involves the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) in the plastid and at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in many plants, including Arabidopsis. Browse et al., (1991) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 42:467-506; and Roughan et al., (1982) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 33:97-132. Fatty acids derived from de novo synthesis in the plastid are assembled into PA in the plastid or at the ER. In Arabidopsis, diacylglycerols derived from the plastid pathway or the ER pathway are present in galactolipids in approximately equal proportion. Browse et al., (1986) Biochem. J. 235:25-31. The Arabidopsis lipid galactosyltransferases MGD1 and DGD1, which successively galactosylate diacylglycerol, are associated with the inner and the outer chloroplast envelope membranes, respectively. Benning et al., (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280:2397-2400. The topology of the galactolipid biosynthetic machinery and the involvement of the ER pathway require extensive subcellular lipid trafficking, most of which is mechanistically not understood.",
                                "To date, two mutants of Arabidopsis have been described that affect lipid trafficking from the ER to the plastid. The act1(ats1) mutant is deficient in the plastidic glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase, and most of the galactolipids in this mutant are derived from the ER pathway. Kunst et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4143-4147. In contrast, galactolipids in the tgd1 mutant are primarily derived from the plastid pathway. Xu et al., (2003) EMBO J. 22:2370-2379. This mutant presents a complex lipid phenotype comprising: i) the accumulation of oligogalactolipids (i.e., for example, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol) and triacylglycerols in the leaves; ii) a 5-fold increase in PA content; and iii) an increase of 16-carbon fatty acids in the galactolipids. Xu et al., (2005) Plant Cell 17:3094-3110.",
                                "Such observations are believed indicative of a change in molecular species toward those formed de novo in the plastid. Xu et al., (2003) EMBO J. 22:2370-2379; and Xu et al., (2005) Plant Cell 17:3094-3110. These observations comprised pulse-chase labeling of leaves that were consistent with a disruption of the transfer of lipid molecular species from the ER to the plastid in the tgd1 mutant. Isolated tgd1 chloroplasts showed a decreased rate of conversion of labeled PA into galactolipids. The TGD1 protein resembles the permease component of bacterial ABC transporters and was shown to be an integral component of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Such data supports a proposed that TGD1 is a component of a PA transporter in the inner chloroplast envelope and may play a role in the biosynthesis of ER-derived molecular species of galactolipids. Stronger alleles of tgd1 led to increased embryo arrest and seed abortion, suggesting that the affected biological process is essential.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a composition comprising a trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 2 (tgd2) mutant of Arabidopsis. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a TGD2 gene. In one embodiment, the composition comprises a TGD2 protein.",
                                "Pulse-chase labeling of leaves also indicates a disruption of the transfer of lipid molecular species from the ER to the plastid in the tgd1 mutant. For example, isolated tgd1 chloroplasts show a decreased rate of conversion of labeled PA into galactolipids. The TGD1 protein resembles the permease component of bacterial ABC transporters and was shown to be an integral component of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Such observations lead to the proposal that TGD1 is a component of a PA transporter in the inner chloroplast envelope and that may be involved in biosynthesis of ER-derived molecular species of galactolipids. A second Arabidopsis TGD, trigalactosyldiacylglycerol 2 (tgd2), has been identified and characterized.",
                                "Protein importation into chloroplasts is believed to involve an interaction of protein complexes spanning the inner and outer chloroplast envelope membranes. Gutensohn et al., (2006) J. Plant Physiol. 163:333-347; and Jarvis et al., (2004) Curr. Biol. 14:R1064-R1077. Currently, knowledge about lipid importation into the plastid is extremely limited. Like protein importation into the plastid, ER-derived lipid importation during chloroplast biogenesis is extensive and presumably requires transporters mediating the transfer of lipids between and through the involved membranes.",
                                "As discussed above, TGD1 and TGD2 proteins may comprise components of a lipid transporter of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Although the analysis of the tgd1-1 mutant to date is far more extensive, it is apparent that the tgd2-1 mutation causes identical biochemical and physiological phenotypes: i) the accumulation of oligogalactolipids and triacylglycerols; ii) the increase of 16-carbon fatty acids in plastid lipids indicative of reduced presence of ER-derived molecular species; and iii) the increase in growth in the dgd1 background. Until the presently disclosed invention, a difference in phenotypes between TGD1 and TGD2 had not been identified, thereby suggesting that the products of the two genes are involved in the same biological process, thylakoid lipid biosynthesis from ER-derived precursors.",
                                "Currently available molecular analysis supported this interpretation because: i) TGD1 and TGD2 proteins are localized in the inner chloroplast envelope membrane; and ii) expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions for both proteins cause punctate fluorescence patterns in the periphery of plastids. Moreover, the Arabidopsis TGD1 and TGD2 proteins were reported as similar permeases and substrate-binding proteins of bacterial ABC transporters, respectively. Their corresponding bacterial orthologs are found in clusters, which is usually interpreted as meaning that the function of the gene products are in the same pathway or process. Overbeek et al., (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33:5691-5702.",
                                "Nonetheless, past research was unable to identify unambiguous evidence for any direct similarities in TGD1 and TGD2 function. Two findings suggest that TGD2 is active in a protein-lipid complex in Arabidopsis because: i) ectopic expression of the tgd2-1 mutant cDNA gives rise to the mutant phenotype, i.e., a dominant-negative mutation; and ii) the wild-type TGD2 protein is protected in isolated chloroplasts against trypsin whereas the TGD2 fusion protein is not. Both results can be interpreted as the association of the TGD2 protein with other proteins and/or specific lipid domains inaccessible to proteolytic activity.",
                                "Previous investigation of the tgd1-1 mutant indicated the accumulation of PA, and the reduced incorporation of PA into glycolipids of isolated plastids, led to the suggestion that the TGD1 protein is a component of a PA transporter. Xu et al., (2005) Plant Cell 17:3094-3110. Consistent with the proposed interaction of TGD1 and TGD2 in a PA-transporting complex, the recombinant TGD2 protein lacking the membrane-spanning domain was found to specifically bind PA. See, FIG. 8. An alternative interpretation would be that TGD2 binds PA as an effector molecule modulating the activity of TGD1. Further, TGD2 could remove a PA molecule from the outer envelope membrane and make it available to TGD1 for import into the plastid and conversion by the plastidic PA phosphatase. Because TGD2 appears to be tethered with its membrane-spanning domain to the inner envelope membrane, the PA binding domain might reach out to the inside of the outer envelope membrane either locally fusing the two membranes or extracting an ER-derived PA. Although, to date, there is no direct evidence for this hypothesis, one intriguing observation in support is derived from mycobacterial orthologs of TGD2 required for cell entry of the bacterium. Chitale et al., (2001) Cell. Microbiol. 3:247-254. Recombinant bacterial orthologs can mediate the uptake of latex beads into mammalian cells, a process requiring an interaction of the protein on the bacterial surface with the mammalian cell membrane. The MCE domains present in the MCE proteins or bacterial substrate binding proteins associated with ABC transporters have been delineated based on sequence. The finding that TGD2 specifically binds PA, possibly through its MCE domain, might also be relevant to the possibility that these bacterial proteins interact with membrane lipids."

                                "Phosphatidic acid (PA) has only recently been identified as a putative signaling molecule in both plants and animals. Nonetheless, PA already appears to be equivalent to the classic second messengers Ca2+ and/or cAMP. In plants, PA's formation may be triggered in response to various biotic and abiotic stress factors, including pathogen infection, drought, salinity, wounding and cold. In general, PA signal production is fast (i.e., for example, in minutes) and transient. Recently, reports indicated that PA formation in stress responses may be a result of phospholipases C and D activity. Moreover, some protein targets of PA have been identified. Testerink et al., \u201cPhosphatidic acid: a multifunctional stress signaling lipid in plants\u201d Trends Plant Sci. 2005 August; 10(8):368-375.",
                                "Phospholipid-derived molecules maybe involved as second messengers in plant defense signaling. Recent research has begun to reveal PA signals produced by the enzymes phospholipase C, phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 in relationship to their putative downstream targets. These include, but are not limited to, the activation of a MAP kinase cascade and triggering of an oxidative burst by phosphatidic acid; the regulation of ion channels and proton pumps by lysophospholipids and free fatty acids; and the conversion of free fatty acids into bioactive octadecanoids such as jasmonic acid. Laxalt et al., \u201cPhospholipid signalling in plant defence\u201d Curr Opin Plant Biol. 2002 August; 5(4):332-338.",
                                "PA may also be a positive regulator of RPM1- or RPS2-mediated disease resistance signalling, and that an observed biphasic PA production may be a conserved feature of signalling induced by the coiled-coil nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat class of resistance proteins. Bacterial pathogens are believed to deliver type III effector proteins into plant cells during an infection. On susceptible host plants, type III effectors contribute to virulence, but on resistant hosts they betray the pathogen to the plant's immune system and are functionally termed avirulence (Avr) proteins. Recognition induces a complex suite of cellular and molecular events comprising the plant's inducible defence response. As recognition of type III effector proteins occurs inside host cells, defence responses can be elicited by in planta expression of bacterial type III effectors. Andersson et al., \u201cPhospholipase-dependent signalling during the AvrRpm1- and AvrRpt2-induced disease resistance responses in Arabidopsis thaliana\u201d Plant J. 2006 September; 47(6):947-59. Recognition of either of two type III effectors, AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2 from Pseudomonas syringae, induced a biphasic accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA). The first wave of PA accumulation correlated with disappearance of monophosphatidylinosotol (PIP) and is thus tentatively attributed to activation of a PIP specific phospholipase C (PLC) in concert with diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) activity. Subsequent activation of phospholipase D (PLD) produced large amounts of PA from structural phospholipids. This later wave of PA accumulation was several orders of magnitude higher than the PLC-dependent first wave. Inhibition of phospholipases blocked the response, and feeding PA directly to leaf tissue caused cell death and defence-gene activation. Inhibitor studies ordered these events relative to other known signalling events during the plant defense response. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ occurred downstream of PIP-degradation, but upstream of PLD activation. Production of reactive oxygen species occurred downstream of the phospholipases.",
                                "The involvement of phospholipase C/diacylglycerol kinase (PLC/DGK)-mediated signalling in oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death was studied in rice suspension-cultured cells treated with benzothiadiazole (BTH) and infected by Xanthomonas oryza pv. oryza (Xoo), believed to be a causative factor of rice leaf blight disease. Treatment of rice suspension cells with BTH resulted in a significant oxidative burst, as indicated by accumulation of superoxide anion and H2O2, and hypersensitive cell death, as determined by Evans blue staining. A peak in oxidative burst was detected 3-4 h after BTH treatment and hypersensitive cell death was observed 8 h after treatment. In addition, significant oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death were detected in BTH-treated suspension cells, but not in untreated control cells, after Xoo infection. Scavengers and antioxidants of active oxygen species, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, N-acetylcysteine, and flavone, reduced significantly the BTH-induced oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death, indicating that oxidative burst is required for BTH-induced hypersensitive cell death. Expression of the PLC/DGK pathway genes, a diacylglycerol kinase gene, OsDAGK1, and a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C gene, OsPI-PLC1, and a defense-related EREBP transcriptional factor gene, OsBIERF3, was activated in rice cells after BTH treatment and in the BTH-treated cells after Xoo infection. Treatment of rice cells with phosphatidic acid, a phospholipid signalling molecule, resulted in the production of oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death. However, neomycin, a PLC inhibitor, inhibited partially but not completely the production of oxidative burst, hypersensitive cell death, and expression of OsBIERF3 and OsDAGK1 induced by BTH in rice cells. These results suggest that PLC/DGK-mediated signalling plays an important role in BTH-induced oxidative burst, hypersensitive response, and activation of defense response in rice.

                                "Phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in multiple plant stress responses. Its gene transcription and activity increase upon exposure to various stresses, and manipulation of PLD protein levels leads to altered stress tolerance. The plant PLD family is relatively large and heterogeneous, and different PLD isoforms are involved in separate stress responses. PLD and its product, phosphatidic acid, exert their effects by functioning in signal transduction cascades and by influencing the biophysical state of lipid membranes.

Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy provided a high-throughput metabolic fingerprint of M. grisea interacting with the B. distachyon accessions ABR1 (susceptible) and ABR5 (resistant). Principal component-discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) allowed the differentiation between developing disease symptoms and host resistance. Examination of PC-DFA loading plots indicated that fatty acids were one chemical group that discriminated between responses by ABR1 and ABR5 to M. grisea. To identify these, non-polar extracts of M. grisea-challenged B. distachyon were directly infused into an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (ESI-MS). PC-DFA indicated that M. grisea-challenged ABR1 and ABR5 were differentially clustered away from healthy material. Subtraction spectra and PC-DFA loadings plots revealed discriminatory analytes (m/z) between each interaction and seven metabolites were subsequently identified as phospholipids (PLs) by ESI-MS-MS. Phosphatidyl glycerol (PG) PLs were suppressed during both resistant and susceptible responses. By contrast, different phosphatidic acid PLs either increased or were reduced during resistance or during disease development. This suggests considerable and differential PL processing of membrane lipids during each interaction which may be associated with the elaboration/suppression of defence mechanisms or developing disease symptoms. Allwood et al., \u201cMetabolomic approaches reveal that phosphatidic and phosphatidyl glycerol phospholipids are major discriminatory non-polar metabolites in responses by Brachypodium distachyon to challenge by Magnaporthe grisea\u201d Plant J. 2006 May; 46(3):351-68.",

Antisense abrogation of PLD\u03b1 decreased post-wounding phosphatidic acid induction, jasmonic acid (JA), and a JA-regulated gene for vegetative storage protein. Examination of the genes involved in the initial steps of oxylipin synthesis revealed that abrogation of the PLD\u03b1 attenuated the wound-induced expression of lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) but had no effect on allene oxide synthase (AOS) or hydroperoxide lyase in wounded leaves. The systemic induction of LOX2, AOS, and vegetative storage protein was lower in the PLD\u03b1-suppressed plants than in wild-type plants, with AOS exhibiting a distinct pattern. These results indicate that activation of PLD mediates wound induction of JA and that LOX2 is probably a downstream target through which PLD promotes the production of JA.

                                "Over the years, several signaling lipids have been identified in plants (1, 2). Among those are various important sphingolipids, glycerol lipids and fatty acid metabolites (3-6). Phosphatidic acid (PA), was found to be one representative signaling lipid. PA may represent a lipid second messenger that transiently accumulates in plants within minutes after a pathogen attack and/or a variety of stress conditions (i.e., for example, osmotic and temperature stress) (7-9). PA may be generated via two distinct pathways: i) by phosphalipase D (PLD), which is believed to hydrolyze structural phospholipids to generate PA; or ii) by sequential action of phospholipase C (PLC) and diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase (DGK), wherein PLC can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [Ptdlns(4,5)P2, PIP2] into inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] and DAG, which may be immediately converted to PA by DGK (10).",

                                "Despite ongoing efforts, the identification of PA targets has remained elusive. A few cellular targets of PA have been described but no clear lipid binding motif has been found. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that predicting biochemical interactions with PA may be difficult because since the putative targets may not share sequence similarity. For example, in mammalian cells, protein kinases Raf-1 (11; 12), protein phosphatases SHP-1(13) and PP1(14), and protein kinase C\u03b5 (15) have been reported as PA targets. In yeast, the SNARE protein Spo20p (16) and the inositol-regulated transcriptional repressor Opi1p(17) are putative PA targets.",
                                "Similarly, a limited number of PA targets have so far been identified in plants, for example, ABI1 (ABA insensitive 1) (18) and PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) (19). In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates that PA may be a positive regulator of the ABA signaling pathway. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that ABI1 may be a protein phosphatase 2C that negatively regulates ABA signaling, whereupon the ABA response, PA becomes induced and binds to ABI1, thereby reducing its phosphatase activity and resulting in translocation to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, Arabidopsis PDK1 is believed to be a protein kinase that binds both PA and phosphoinositides, whose activation is limited to PA and not by polyphosphoinositides (19, 20). Additional PA targets were isolated using a PA-affinity matrix, consisting of a PA analogue covalently linked to Affi-Gel 10, which is incubated with suspension-cultured tomato or Arabidopsis cell lysates (21). Mass spectrometry has shown that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) preferentially binds to PA over other phospholipids (21).",

                                "PA is also believed to act as a substrate that may be directly transported across the membranes by phospholipids and thus play a role in membrane biogenesis. For instance, it is believed that TGD2 comprises a PA target involved in lipid trafficking between the ER and chloroplast. On study has suggested that TGD2C (i.e., the C-terminal 6\u00d7-His tag-fused protein of TGD2 having both the N-terminal transit peptide and transmembrane domain removed) interacts selectively with PA (22). Further, an Arabidopsis TGD2 protein is proposed to be the substrate binding component of a lipid transfer complex in the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Supporting this mechanism is the observation that the lipid transfer complex also comprises TGD1, a permease, wherein loss of function of TGD1 results in accumulation of PA in Arabidopsis plants (23, 24). Loss of function of other lipid transfer complex components also disrupt the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-pathway of thylakoid lipid biosynthesis. Thus, TGD proteins, in general, play an active role in PA transport between the ER and the chloroplast, and possibly thylakoid lipid biosynthesis pathway as well.",

In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for characterizing PA-binding domains in TGD2.

The results suggested that, like TGD2C-His, a DsRed-TGD2C WT protein also shows specificity for PA over other lipids. FIG. 15, right. To verify that the binding was not due to non-specific PA interactions with DsRed, DsRed protein itself was also assayed for binding.

The DsRed-TGD2CWT fusion proteins were found to bind PC/PA liposome mixtures, as most of the proteins remained in the pellet/bound fraction. FIG. 2A, left panel, bottom.

These blot were scanned, each individual band was quantified, and the resulted data was plotted and fit to the Hill equation for receptor-ligand binding. FIG. 2B. The data revealed that liposomes made with 100% PA bound the greatest amount of the protein. Moreover, from the Sigmoidal fit, the half maximal binding affinity (Kd) of DsRed-TGD2C WT for PA was estimated to be 39.8 mol % PA (wt/wt), which is comparable to the results obtained for RafC-PA association (20 mol % PA) (11). From the binding plot, a Hill number of 5.8 was obtained, suggestive of positive cooperativity. FIG. 2B. Again, this value is similar to that obtained for RafC-PA interaction (Hill number between 3.3 and 6.2) (11). The results may reflect that there is a cooperative sequestering of a domain of PA surrounding the C-terminal part of the TGD2 protein.",
                                "3. Identification of TGD2C PA Binding Regions",
                                "It has been reported that various reported PA-binding regions share no significant homology in primary structures (10). Consequently, attempting to identify any TGD2 PA binding domain was not intuitively obvious. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method to identify TGD2 PA-binding regions by using a liposome-association assay. In one embodiment, the liposome association assay comprised incubating liposomes with purified mutant proteins. In one embodiment, the mutant proteins comprised amino acid sequences generated using a TGD2C nucleic acid template. In one embodiment, the TGD2C nucleic acid template generated deletion or truncation nucleic acid sequence mutants encoding a mutant TDG2C protein. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence mutants were fused to a C-terminal end of a DsRed nucleic acid open reading frame. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that because the liposome association assay relies on a nonquantitative assessment of binding to identify regions of lipid interaction within the protein, maximizing the binding of TGD2 proteins was highly desired. The present data show that liposomes made with 100% PA bind the greatest amount of the TGD2 protein. FIG. 2. Hence, the binding reactions reported herein included liposomes comprised of 100% PA to achieve the highest lipid binding specificity. As a specificity control, liposomes comprised of 100% phosphatidylcholine (PC) and/or 50% PC+50% PA were included for comparison. Insolubility problems due to the deletion of large portions of the protein (i.e., for example, possibly exposing hydrophobic domain) were solved by using the DsRed protein as a solubilizing and stabling partner. As a result, all the generated mutant proteins disclosed herein were obtained at a satisfactory amount and purity. PA binding data for these representative TGD2 protein mutants are presented. FIG. 3.",
                                "These data show binding characteristics of representative truncated TGD2 mutants ranging in length from between approximately 130 to 180 amino acids. FIG. 3A. DRWT (119-381) and four mutants displayed significant binding to PA, while having no interaction with the PC control lipid. DsRed itself does not display binding to either PC or PA, confirming the specificity of PA binding by TGD2. FIG. 3B. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that these data suggest that the PA-specific binding domain might reside in the TGD2 region comprising 221-250 amino acid residues, since this region overlaps between the tested mutants.",
                                "Two internal deletion mutants within the 221-250 amino acid residues were then generated and tested for PA binding. Surprisingly, the deletion of entire 221-250 region did not seem to affect PA binding, while the deletion of a smaller 221-225 region decreases binding activity dramatically. FIG. 3C.",
                                "This data was completely counterintuitive and required considerable analysis before proceeding with further evaluation. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that protein folding effects may mediate this observation, wherein a deletion could potentially disrupt or reconstitute the protein structure and thus affect protein function depending on the realistic location of the function domain. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a PA binding domain that is in or close to a TGD2 region comprising amino acid residues 221-250. Observations that a fifth mutant (i.e., comprising, amino acid residues 119-300) also shows strong binding to PA provide corroborating data. FIG. 3C.",
                                "These initial deletion studies indicate that a region between residues 201 and 225 may be sufficient for PA specific binding, even when fused with DsRed. Furthermore, it was observed that this short fusion segment has much less overall binding, suggesting the presence of a minimal PA binding domain (infra).",

In one embodiment, the binding domain was identified by fragmenting a TGD2 region comprising amino acid residues 119-250 (SEQ ID NO: 11). In one embodiment, the fragments were fused to DsRed, and assayed using liposome association.",
                                "In brief, amino acids were removed from the N-terminal of TGD2C down to the middle of a TGD2C region comprising amino acid residues 221-250 (i.e., for example, amino acid residue 225). See, FIG. 4A. The data indicated that a 25 amino acid sequence (i.e., for example, amino acid residues 201-225; SEQ ID NO: 12) is sufficient to mediate specific binding to PA. FIG. 4A. A TGD2C region comprising amino acid residues 221-250 was also tested; however, no interaction to PA was detected. These data indicate that this TGD2C region may play a lesser role in PA binding, and partially explains why deletion of this region does not appreciably affect PA binding (supra). A protein-lipid overlay in accordance with Example II verified PA binding by the 25 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 12). FIG. 4B. Similar to DR-WT, this mutant itself binds PA on the membrane strip, with apparent lower affinity.",
                                "Some reports have identified that TGD2 PA-binding regions involve basic amino acids and/or tryptophan residues (10). In particular, one recent study shows that electrostatic interactions of PA with basic amino acids (i.e., for example, lysine and/or arginine) combined with hydrogen bond interactions, may form a basis for specific binding of PA to PA targets (33). Based on sequence similarity of TGD2 to its closely related homologs in plants and green algae, several charged and/or conserved amino acids were picked as potential interesting residues in the 25-mer minimal domain for possibly mediating interactions with PA. An alanine screen was then performed to evaluate these residues within a minimal PA binding region of TGD2 (i.e., for example, SEQ ID NO:12). Point mutations were generated in the 25-mer minimal domain and fused with DsRed to test PA binding by liposome-association assay using 100% PA liposomes. The data demonstrate that, all point mutations have little or no effect on PA-liposome binding except K221A. FIG. 4C. This lysine-to-alanine mutation significantly reduced the amount of interaction with PA-liposomes. No detectable PC-liposome binding was observed for any of the constructs (data not shown).",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a TGD2 PA binding domain comprising amino acid residues 201-225 (SEQ ID NO: 12). In one embodiment, the binding domain is adjacent to a MCE domain. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that mutation of 221Lys to 221Ala significantly diminishes PA binding. Further, upon generation of a point mutant (K221A) within a minimal domain, PA binding was diminished, thereby identifying 221Lys as an amino acid residue involved in PA binding. This discovery is consistent with previous hypotheses that basic amino acids and/or tryptophan might be involved in lipid PA binding (10; 33).",
                                "Surprisingly, a PA binding TGD2 minimal domain is sufficient, but not necessary, to mediate interactions between TGD2 and PA liposomes. For example, a TGD2 fragment wherein a minimal domain was deleted still retains residual binding activity, albeit with significantly lower affinity. Moreover, a TGD2 protein having a minimal domain deletion still displays positive cooperativity to PA binding. FIGS. 5E and 5F. These data suggested the presence of accessory PA binding domains or segments that also play a role in cooperating PA binding by the minimal domain.",

                                "The above data showing that DR-WT protein displayed positive cooperativity upon PA binding suggested that a 25 amino acid sequence comprising a minimal PA binding domain may not be acting independently. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the minimal binding domain may comprise accessory biochemical properties involved in PA binding. Liposome-association assay was performed with mixed PA/PC liposomes using DR-WT as a quantification control. The data show DR-25 binding to PA loses positive cooperativity, while DR-WT binding to PA still obeys the Hill equation, with a modified Kd of 37.66 mol % and a Hill number of 2.8. FIGS. 5A-5C.",
                                "A 25-mer deletion mutant (designated as DR-\u039425) was generated that retained some residual PA binding activity. But moreover, the binding of this deletion mutant to PA also displayed positive cooperativity. An increased Kd of 53.47 mol % and a Hill number of 7.3 were identified from the fitting curve. FIGS. 5E and 5F. In contrast, the data show that DR-25 is not cooperative. FIGS. 5D and 5F. Apparently, a 25-mer minimal domain, alone, is sufficient to facilitate PA binding, but might also involve accessory components. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates PA binding accessory components capable of modulating PA binding of TGD2 protein. This hypothesis is consistent with observations that some deletions of the TDG2 region comprising amino acid residues 221-250 do not affect PA binding, while some deletions of the TDG2 region comprising amino acid residues 221-225 significantly decrease PA binding activity. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that these observations also suggest that there are accessory PA binding components flanking the TGD2 region comprising amino acid residues 201-225, wherein different deletions differentially affect protein folding and, ultimately, functionality. This semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated that PA binding by a minimal domain lost positive cooperativity, which was also a property of wild type TGD2C protein.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a plurality of TGD2 accessory PA binding segments. For example, TGD2 mutants were generated with truncated sequences from either the C-terminus (i.e., for example, amino acid residue 381) or within the middle of TGD2 (i.e., for example, amino acid residue 204) and fused to an DsRed open reading frame. (FIG. 6B). These mutated TGD2 proteins were tested for PA binding by using the liposome association assay using 100% PA liposomes. The data show that, at least four mutants were found to have various PA binding activity. FIG. 6B. In one embodiment, a TGD2 accessory PA binding site comprises amino acid residues 251-300. In one embodiment, a TGD2 accessory PA binding site comprises amino acid residues 161-204. In one embodiment, a TGD2 accessory PA binding site comprises amino acid residues 291-340.",

In one embodiment, a PA binding motif further comprises at least three other regions in proximity with, or adjacent to, a TGD2 minimal PA binding domain. In one embodiment, the TGD2 minimal PA binding domain comprises amino acid residues 201-225, wherein at least one amino acid residue is a proline. In one embodiment, at least two amino acids are prolines. In one embodiment, at least three amino acids are prolines. In one embodiment, at least four amino acids are proline. In one embodiment, at least five amino acids are prolines. In one embodiment, at least six amino acids are prolines. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that proline residues within the TGD2 region comprising amino acid residues 201-225 may induce folding alongside an N-terminal \u03b2-strand and a C-terminal \u03b1-helix to form a PA binding site.",
                                "This proline-induced folding hypothesis is supported by a secondary structure prediction showing that residues 201-225 is a loop-strand fold lacks helical or \u03b2-strand structure. FIG. 1A. Therefore, a full PA binding domain on TGD2 likely comprises amino acid residues comprising a minimal PA binding domain (i.e., for example, TGD2 amino acid residues 201-225) as well as amino acid residues present in both sides of a minimal PA binding domain (i.e., for example, amino acid residues 161-204 and/or amino acid residues 251-300). Such a combination of a minimal PA binding domain with at least one accessory PA binding domain is believed to generate a complete PA binding domain having a complicated tertiary binding structure.",
                                "Because the TGD2 protein resembles substrate binding proteins of bacterial ABC transporters, and because the tgd2-1 phenotype was consistent with a defect in lipid transfer into the chloroplast, the TGD2 protein was tested for the specific binding of different lipids. To distinguish lipid binding to the TMD from lipid binding to a possible substrate site in the C-terminal domain, an N-terminally truncated version, TGD2-dTMD-His, was produced in Escherichia tag was used for purification and detection of TGD2-dTMD-His by an anti-His tag antibody. A commercial membrane with different phospholipids and membranes with plant-specific lipids were used. Of all of the lipids tested, including diacylglycerol (data not shown), only PA bound to TGD2-dTMD-His. See, FIG. 8A.",

Liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine alone did not bind. Binding was independent of the molecular species of PA at least at the semiquantitative immunoblot level. The results suggested that TGD2 contains a PA-specific binding domain in the C-terminal part of the protein.",

The quality of the expressed fusion protein was routinely monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Typically, the purity of the DsRed-TGD2 fusion proteins was greater than 90%. A variety of DsRed-TGD2 mutated fusion proteins have been evaluated. Table 2.",

(22) However, a major drawback of using this reported His-tag-fused-TGD2C protein is bad solubility, which brings significant technical difficulties when attempting mutagenesis and other in vitro studies. In fact, most reports in the lipid binding field use GST-fusion techniques to create a better solubilized protein. However, GST-TGD2 fusion proteins also resulted in unsatisfactory results. While expression and purification of the GST-TGD2 fusion protein was possible, GST alone resulted in non-specific PA binding to the tested lipid substrates, leading to controversial conclusions (data not shown).",

As discussed above, these DsRed-TGD2 fusion proteins demonstrated specific PA binding using protein-lipid overlay assay. See, FIG. 7. Furthermore, a minimal PA binding domain in TGD2 was identified that is sufficient to mediate the interaction between the protein and lipid. These data: i) demonstrate that TGD2 specifically binds PA and is a possible substrate for transportation by the proposed TGD123 complex; and (2) define a specific TGD2 PA binding domain that does not show any sequence or structure homology with known PA targets.",

Attempts to identify other PA binding proteins using a TGD2-minimal PA binding domain sequence (i.e., for example, amino acid residues 201-225) yielded no results when searching a non-redundant protein database.

Xu et al., (2003) EMBO J. 22:2370-2379. The dgd1 mutant was reported to be deficient in DGD1, the protein believed responsible for the bulk of digalactolipid biosynthesis. Do{umlaut over ( )}rmann et al., (1999) Science 284:2181-2184. Presence of the tgd2-1 mutation in the dgd1 background partially alleviated the digalactolipid deficiency and caused the accumulation of a lipid co-chromatographing with trigalactosyldiacylglycerol diagnostic for all tgd mutants. Crossing the double-homozygous dgd1/tgd1-1 and dgd1/tgd2 mutants gave rise to uniform plants in the F1 generation with a homozygous dgd1-like phenotype, suggesting that tgd1-1 and tgd2-1 are not allelic. The tgd2-1/dgd1 homozygous double mutant was crossed to Arabidopsis wild-type, ecotype Columbia-2 (Col-2). The F1 plants showed a wild-type lipid phenotype confirming that the tgd2-1 mutant allele is recessive. After selfing and lipid analysis, F2 plants homozygous at the tgd2-1 locus were genotyped at the DGD1 locus by using a derived cut amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) marker to test for loss of the dgd1 mutation. A homozygous tgd2-1 mutant line was back-crossed with wild type (Col-2) three times to reduce the chance of secondary mutations. Unless indicated otherwise, further analysis was done with this tgd2-1 mutant in the wild-type background.",

Leaf lipid extracts of the wild type and the tgd1-1 and tgd2-1 mutants were compared by TLC. In the tgd2-1 sample a lipid staining positive for sugar and cochromatographing with authentic trigalactolipid of tgd1-1 is present. See, FIG. 10A. A lipid co-chromatographing with authentic triacylglycerol accumulating in tgd1-1 leaves was present in the tgd2-1 sample as well. See, FIG. 10B. Quantitative analysis of the polar lipids indicated similar changes in the two mutants with relative amounts of the monogalactolipid and digalactolipid reduced and relative amounts of phosphatidylcholine increased. See, FIG. 10C. In addition, trigalactolipid was present to a similar extent in both mutants (tgd1-1, 2.7\u00b11.4 mol %; tgd2-1, 1.6\u00b10.4 mol %; n=4; data are \u00b1SD) but was not detectable in the wild type. Analyzing the fatty acid composition of the two galactolipids indicated a reduction of 18-carbon fatty acids and an increase in 16-carbon fatty acids to the same extent in both mutants. See, FIG. 10D. These overall fatty acid compositions for the tgd2-1 mutant imply a change in molecular species distribution in the two galactolipids consistent with a reduction of molecular species derived from the ER pathway. In addition, similar to the tgd1-1 mutant carrying a weak chemically-induced mutant allele, the tgd2-1 mutant produced a fraction 43%, 281 of 651 in a representative sample) of aborted seeds.",

See, FIG. 11A. In an enlarged F2 mapping population from the same cross (3,506 chromosomes) the tgd2-1 mutant locus was mapped to an \u02dc45-kb fragment flanked by CAPS marker MQC12-3 and dCAPS marker MQC12-4.

AAD17959; 25.0% identity over >100 aa) of Pseudomonas putida. T his protein is predicted to be the substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter, and its ORF is flanked by one encoding the ABC transporter permease ttg2B (GenBank accession no. AAD17958).

NC\u25a1003074) and leading to a glycine-to-arginine change in the amino acid sequence. See, FIG. 11A.

See, FIG. 13B. The TGD2 wild type and the tgd2-1 mutant proteins were detected with a polyclonal antibody against TGD2. The chloroplasts were either untreated or treated with thermolysin, a protease unable to penetrate the outer envelope membrane, or trypsin, a protease able to penetrate the outer envelope but not the inner envelope membrane. Interestingly, the wild-type TGD2 protein was resistant to both proteases, whereas the mutant protein tgd2-1 was resistant to thermolysin but not trypsin. See, FIG. 13B, top and middle.",

See, FIG. 13B, bottom. With the exception of the TGD2 wild-type protein, the result suggests that the TGD2 protein is associated with the inner envelope membrane with the C terminus facing the intermembrane space. The wild-type TGD2 is trypsin-resistant either because it is inside the plastid or, more likely, because it is in a complex or a membrane domain inaccessible to trypsin."

Loss of function of this protein or other components of this complex disrupts the ER-pathway of thylakoid lipid biosynthesis. Previous studies demonstrated that the C-terminal 6\u00d7-His tag-fused protein of TGD2 (TGD2C, with removal of the N-terminal transit peptide and transmembrane domain) interacts selectively with phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). Awai et al., (2006) \u201cA phosphatidic acid-binding protein of the chloroplast inner envelope membrane involved in lipid trafficking\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103: 10817-10822) To improve expression and solubilization of this protein, we fused the open reading frame encoding the TGD2C truncated protein C-terminally to the Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) open reading frame and expressed the fused open reading frame under the control of the T7 promoter. Like its predecessor, the DsRed-TGD2C fusion protein was shown to specifically bind PtdOH.
