    "abstract": "Disclosed herein include methods, compositions, and kits suitable for use in sorting a population of cells. In some embodiments, the method comprises flowing a fluid sample comprising a population of cells through a microfluidic channel. The population of cells can be configured to express gas vesicles (GVs) in a context-dependent manner. The expression of GVs within a cell can increase the compressibility (\u03b2) and reduce the density (\u03c1) of said cell, thereby modulating the acoustic contrast (\u03a6) of said cell relative to the fluid in the microfluidic channel.

                                "The ability to selectively manipulate and control the spatial arrangement of genetically defined cells is critical for the fields of living materials, biomedicine and synthetic biology. Ultrasound has the ability to manipulate a variety of objects remotely and en masse with high spatial and temporal precision via acoustic radiation force (ARF). However, this capability is currently disconnected from intracellular genetic programs. Here, it is shown that gas vesicles (GVs) - a unique class of genetically encoded gas-filled protein nanostructures - can serve as genetically encodable actuators for ARF, enabling the selective acoustic inversion and manipulation of engineered cells. Due to their differential density and compressibility relative to water, GVs are effectively moved with acoustic standing waves despite their nanometer dimensions. When expressed inside genetically engineered cells, GVs amplify the ARF experienced by the cells by a factor of ten and invert their acoustic contrast, allowing the cells to be selectively manipulated with sound waves based on their genotype. This enables dynamic patterning, focal trapping, translation, holographic bioprinting, and microfluidic sorting of specific cells with acoustic fields. In addition, the unique material properties of purified GVs enable new modes of acoustic interaction, including force inactivation, multiplexed manipulation, and endosomal labeling. Unlike fluorescent proteins, which have no intrinsic ability to serve as actuators for cellular manipulation, GVs provide a direct link between gene expression and mechanical actuation, creating a new paradigm for molecular and cellular control in a broad range of contexts.",

                                "The ability to remotely pattern, actuate and apply force to genetically specified cells would have many applications in biomedicine and synthetic biology, ranging from the fabrication of biological living materials and bioprocessing of engineered cells, to drug delivery and noninvasive control of cellular function. Ultrasound offers unique advantages in such contexts over optical, magnetic and printing-based approaches due to its functionality in opaque media, non-invasiveness, relatively high spatial precision on the \u00b5m scale, and rapid, reconfigurable field formation. Acoustic radiation force (ARF) allows ultrasound to manipulate materials whose density or compressibility differ from their surrounding medium. This capability can been used to manipulate, pattern and sort synthetic particles and cells, for example by using acoustic standing waves to create stable attractors for such objects or to separate them in microfluidic devices. However, due to the similarity of acoustic contrast factor among endogenous cellular materials, it is challenging to connect ARF-based actuation directly to intracellular gene expression. Doing so would require a genetically encodable agent capable of drastically altering the acoustic properties of a cell.",
                                "To address this need, it was hypothesized that gas vesicles (GVs) - a unique class of biologically assembled air-filled protein nanostructures - could experience strong ARF and enable the selective acoustic manipulation of GV-expressing cells. GVs are genetically encoded protein-shelled nanostructures with hydrodynamic diameters on the order of 250 nm (FIGS. 1A-1B) which evolved in aquatic photosynthetic microbes as a means to achieve buoyancy for improved access to sunlight. GVs comprise a physically stable hollow compartment enclosed by a 2 nm-thick protein shell that is permeable to gas but excludes liquid water. Based on their unique physical properties, GVs were recently developed as genetically encodable and engineerable contrast agents for non-invasive imaging. However, the ability of GVs to serve as actuators of ARF has not been tested.",
                                "It was hypothesized that GVs\u2032 differential density and compressibility relative to aqueous media would allow these nanostructures to experience significant ARF (FIG. 1C), and that cells genetically engineered to express GVs would experience a drastically different radiation force due to changes in their acoustic properties (FIGS. 1D-1E). It was further hypothesized that the resulting forces would act in the opposite direction from other biomaterials, which are generally denser than water, allowing selective acoustic manipulation. This would connect mechanical actuation directly to the expression of a specific gene - a capability not provided by other genetic labels such as fluorescent proteins. In this study, these fundamental hypotheses were tested and the use of GVs was demonstrated in the selective acoustic trapping, translation, patterning, holographic bioprinting, and acoustofluidic sorting of genetically engineered cells. In addition, it is shown herein that the physical properties of purified GVs provide new capabilities for acoustic multiplexing, pressure measurement and endocytic cell labeling.",

                                "To estimate the expected ARF acting on GVs, they were modeled as spherical particles with an effective density of 120 kg/m3 and compressibility of 1.55E-8 Pa-1. Because both of these values are radically different from water (FIG. 1B), it was predicted that GVs would have a strongly negative acoustic contrast in aqueous media, with a contrast factor of -11.7 (FIG. 1F, Eq. 1 in Methods). While cells and most biological components exhibit positive acoustic contrast in aqueous solution, a few materials - such as microbubbles, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer microparticles and lipids - exhibit a negative contrast factor, allowing them to migrate up pressure gradients and efficiently separate from positive-contrast materials, as demonstrated in several important applications. It was hypothesized that GVs could be manipulated in a similar manner by responding directly to ARF at typical frequencies and energy densities of several MHz and ~10-100 J/m3. Despite their nanometer dimensions, it was anticipated that GVs\u2032 exceptionally large contrast factor would allow them to overcome the challenges of sub-micron particle actuation caused by the volumetric scaling of ARF and the competing process of acoustic streaming.",
                                "To test the ability of GV nanostructures to be manipulated with ARF, GVs were purified from the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae (Ana), chemically labeled them with a fluorescent dye, and imaged them in suspension inside a microfluidic channel coupled to a bulk piezoelectric resonator operating at 3.8 MHz (FIG. 2A). The channel width of 200 \u00b5m represents a half-wavelength at this frequency, resulting in a pressure node at its center and antinodes (areas of highest pressure) at each wall (FIG. 2B). As expected based on their negative acoustic contrast, GVs readily migrated to the pressure anti-nodes upon ultrasound application (FIGS. 2C-2D). As a control, GVs that were collapsed before the experiment with hydrostatic pressure were imaged (FIGS. 8A-8C). Neither collapsed GVs nor similarly-sized polystyrene tracer nanoparticles -included as an additional control and indicator of fluid motion - migrated in the acoustic field, confirming the absence of streaming.",
                                "Next, the ARF acting on GV particles in solution was quantified using single-particle tracking (FIG. 2D). The Brownian motion of each particle before ultrasound application was used to determine its mobility and hydrodynamic size (FIG. 2E, Eq. 2 & 5 in Methods). For the same particle, its motion within the acoustic field during ultrasound application was fitted to an equation accounting for the spatial field profile (Eq. 4 in Methods), allowing the determination of peak particle velocity (FIG. 2F). The maximum ARF acting on GV particles was then determined by a balance with hydrodynamic drag, and measured to be 24.5 \u00b1 1.7 fN under the acoustic parameters used in this measurement (FIG. 2G). In contrast, control particles showed no substantial ARF.",
                                "Colloidal association of individual GVs within the microfluidic channel resulted in tracked particles having a range of hydrodynamic radii larger than expected from a single GV. Therefore, to estimate the ARF acting on a single GV, the dependence of the ARF on the hydrodynamic radius of the clusters was plotted and it was fitted with a power law function accounting for fractal clustering (FIG. 2H, Eq. 6 in Methods, force-mobility exponent = 1.39 \u00b1 0.06; R2 = 0.744). Given the acoustic energy applied in this experiment (0.25 \u00b1 0.02 J/m3, FIGS. 9A-9C), this single-particle force corresponds to an acoustic contrast factor of -15 \u00b1 9, consistent with the theoretical estimate of -11.7 (FIG. 1E). Using this contrast factor, one can predict the ARF on a single GV across a range of typical acoustic parameters (FIG. 21), with the expected force spanning from 0.01 to 10 pN. Forces of this magnitude are more than sufficient to overcome Brownian motion, as shown in the disclosed experiments, and are relevant to many biomolecular and cellular interactions. Overall, these results establish GVs as a genetically encodable biomolecular nanomaterial that can be manipulated with acoustic fields.",

                                "Having established the ability of GVs to experience strong ARF, the ability of these genetically encodable nanostructures to act as a driver of ARF response in genetically engineered cells was tested. This possibility is based on the fact that GV expression significantly reduces the average density of the cell, resulting, for example, in the floatation of GV-expressing bacteria in water. In combination with an anticipated increase in average cellular compressibility, this is expected to change the acoustic contrast of the cells from +0.07 to -1.1, inverting the sign of their acoustic contrast from positive to negative and increasing its magnitude by more than 10-fold.",
                                "This hypothesis was first tested by heterologously expressing intracellular GVs in E. coli using a recently developed genetic construct, bacterial acoustic reporter genes (bARG1), comprising of a combination of 13 genes from A. flos-aquae and B. megaterium (FIGS. 3A-3B). After enriching for high expression using centrifugation, which uses buoyancy as an indicator of GV formation, the cells were labeled with a fluorescent dye to enable live cell tracking. bARG1-expressing cells or control cells with pressure-collapsed intracellular GVs were then subjected to acoustic standing waves under static flow conditions using the microfluidic device depicted in FIG. 2A. Remarkably, while control cells showed no response to the applied acoustic field, the genetically modified bARG1-expressing cells containing intact intracellular GVs quickly migrated to pressure antinodes at the channel wall (FIG. 3C and movie data not shown). This result confirms that GV expression results in cells having a negative contrast factor, which is opposite from normal cells (FIG. 1F), and shows that the magnitude of this contrast factor is substantially larger than for wildtype controls, since under the same acoustic conditions the control cells did not migrate to the pressure node. This is consistent with the fact that small cells such as bacteria are challenging to manipulate with ARF in their native form.",
                                "To quantify the ARF enhancement provided by GV expression, single-cell tracking was performed on bARG1-expressing cells containing intact or collapsed intracellular GVs in the presence or absence of applied ultrasound and analyzed the resulting cellular trajectories using the method described above for GVs. It was found that while control cells have an acoustic contrast factor of 0.10 \u00b1 0.02, similar to that of wildtype cells, GV expression provides the engineered cells with an acoustic contrast factor of -1.0 \u00b1 0.2, consistent with the theoretical estimate of -1.1, and representing a 10-fold enhancement in magnitude compared to controls (FIG. 3D).",
                                "After establishing that GVs can strongly amplify cellular ARF, it was next hypothesized that cells expressing GVs can be selectively actuated within a heterogenous cell mixture (FIGS. 3E-3F). To test this hypothesis, a genetic circuit was implemented placing the expression of GVs under the control of chemical induction by isopropyl (\u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and created a cell mixture containing induced and non-induced cells where each population was separately labeled with a fluorescent dye. When ultrasound was applied to this cell mixture under static flow conditions, it was observed that only the cells that have been induced with IPTG were actuated, while the non-induced cells showed no response to the applied acoustic field (FIGS. 3G-3H). These results demonstrate the ability of GVs to connect an acoustophoretic phenotype to the output of a genetic program, providing the means to selectively manipulate cells based on a variety of cellular states.",

                                "Having established that GV-expressing cells experience strong ARF towards areas of high acoustic pressure, it was asked whether this capability would enable the trapping and spatial patterning of living cells. Considerable interest exists in the use of engineered cells as patterned components of living materials for biomedical uses such as tissue engineering, and as self-healing and actively reconfigurable materials in non-biomedical applications. However, few methods exist to dynamically configure the location of cells in 3-D space. In contrast, ARF in the form of engineered standing and traveling waves has been used to create complex 2-D and 3-D arrangements.",
                                "It was hypothesized that ARF combined with GV expression would allow engineered cells to be patterned in a precise and rapid manner. To test this basic concept, a standing wave pattern of repeating pressure antinodes was generated in a specially designed acoustic chamber by using an unfocused 5 MHz transducer reflected by glass (FIG. 4A). Imaging the cells using fluorescence microscopy, it was observed that engineered cells readily adopted the desired pattern in solution, and that changing the ultrasound frequency allows the spatial pattern of these cells to be dynamically reconfigured on the timescale of seconds (FIG. 4B, FIG. 10 and movie data not shown).",
                                "Another method of acoustic manipulation involves the confinement of acoustic particles at the focus of an ultrasound transducer, allowing the particles to be concentrated and transported between discrete locations in space, analogous to an optical trap. To determine whether focal trapping is possible with engineered acoustic cells, a trap was generated using a 40 MHz focused ultrasound transducer reflected on glass (FIG. 4C). This configuration is expected to exert radial ARF on the cells towards the center of the ultrasound focus. As expected, GV-expressing cells within this acoustic field coalesced into a cellular cluster upon ultrasound application (FIG. 4D and movie data not shown) and could then be moved around in space by laterally translating the ultrasound transducer, generating a desired spatiotemporal pattern (FIGS. 4E-4F and movie data not shown).",
                                "Acoustic manipulation can also be used for rapid fabrication of heterogeneous materials by concentrating acoustic particles in spatial patterns defined by the acoustic field, and subsequently immobilizing the pattern with cross-linking chemistry. Negative contrast agents have an intrinsic advantage in this application due to their migration to acoustic pressure maxima, which are more easily patterned in complex spatial arrangements. It was hypothesized that living materials containing GV-expressing acoustic bacteria could be fabricated using this method (FIG. 4G). To test this possibility, an acoustic hologram was created using a single-element 3.5 MHz transducer and a 3D-printed phase mask designed to produce an \u2018R\u2019-shaped pressure profile (FIG. 4H, FIG. 12). This hologram was applied to acoustic bacteria suspended in an agarose solution that can be solidified at cold temperatures to form a gel. As expected, the bacteria were immobilized inside the gel in the desired spatial pattern (FIG. 4I). As an added feature, the spatial distribution of GV-expressing cells could be imaged with ultrasound (FIG. 4J), providing a means to verify patterning in optically opaque media.

                                "Having established GVs as a genetically encodable acoustic actuator in bacteria, the ability of GVs to similarly alter the acoustic properties of mammalian cells was examined (FIG. 5A). To test this concept, human HEK293T cancer cells were engineered to express GVs as part of a chemically inducible genetic program (mARG1) (FIG. 5B). When ultrasound was applied to these cells in the microfluidic channel under static flow conditions, it was observed that a large fraction of the engineered population displayed a negative contrast factor by moving to the pressure antinodes at the channel walls (FIGS. 5C-5D). In contrast, control cells expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry or GV-expressing cells in which GVs were pre-collapsed with hydrostatic pressure migrated to the pressure node in the middle of the channel (FIGS. 5C-5D), as expected from their positive contrast factor.",
                                "After demonstrating the ability of GVs to provide mammalian cells with genetically encoded acoustic actuation, the ability of these biomolecules to serve as externally applied acoustic labels was also tested. For this purpose, fluorescently-tagged GVs were incubated with murine macrophages, leading to the endosomal uptake of the GV particles (FIG. 5E). After applying ultrasound under static flow conditions, it was observed that a distinct sub-population of the macrophages moved towards the pressure antinodes, indicating an inversion of their acoustic contrast (FIG. 5F). Visualizing the separate fluorescence channels corresponding to the macrophages and the GVs revealed that the cells with a negative contrast factor had significantly higher GV content than the positive-contrast cells (FIGS. 5G-5H). In this setting, the GVs enabled mammalian cells to be separated acoustically based on a specific biological function - endocytosis. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of GVs to enable selective manipulation of mammalian cells on the basis of gene expression or biological activity.",

                                "After establishing that GVs can be used to drive differential manipulation of mammalian cells by acoustic fields, it was sought to apply this capability towards acoustic sorting of cells based on their genotype in an acoustofluidic device. Currently, the most common method for genotype-based selection of cells uses fluorescent proteins in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). However, FACS instruments are complex and expensive, often limiting their use to centralized facilities. To enable more widespread genetic engineering and preparation of therapeutic cells, there is a need for more efficient and lower cost methods for genotype-based cell selection. It was hypothesized that GVs in combination with acoustofluidic sorting devices could enable this capability.",
                                "To examine this possibility, mammalian cells were engineered to express GVs via transient transfection, which produces a range of transgene expression levels due to the stochastic incorporation of the transfection complex by the cells. The genetic sequence was designed such that the expression of the GV structural protein, GvpA, is transcriptionally linked to a desired genotype, in this case the expression of a cargo protein via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence (FIG. 6A). A fluorescent protein, EBFP2, was chosen as the model cargo protein to enable the quantification of the cargo expression level optically. Fluorescence and phase-contrast imaging of the engineered cells revealed co-localized expression of EBFP2 and GVs to the same cells (FIG. 6B).",
                                "To enable sorting, an acoustofluidic device was constructed with three fluidic inlets and outlets to facilitate the enrichment process in a continuous flow manner (FIG. 6C). Cells with a range of transgene expression were introduced into the device via the center fluidic inlet and hydrodynamically focused to the center flow stream by the sheath flow introduced by the two side inlets. An acoustic field was applied to a section of the channel, resulting in antinodes at its walls. It was reasoned that cells with sufficient transgene expression, resulting in negative acoustic contrast, would be actuated towards the flow streams near the walls of the channel, while cells with lower transgene expression would remain in the central flow streams due to their neutral or positive acoustic contrast. A trifurcation at the outlet separated the central and peripheral streams, with cells collected from the side outlets expected to be enriched for high transgene expression (FIG. 6C).",
                                "Quantifying the genotypes of the input and output cell populations by fluorescent flow cytometry (FIG. 6D) revealed, as expected, a significant enrichment of EBFP2-positive cells after acoustofluidic sorting (FIG. 6E). This result demonstrates proof of principle for acoustically sorting cells directly based on their genotype in a continuous-flow microfluidic device, with GV-encoding genes serving as a generalizable genetic label for cellular selection and enrichment.",

                                "Finally, after establishing the basic ability of GVs to respond to ARF and serve as genetically encodable cellular actuators, one additional property of these nanostructures was examined: their ability to be collapsed at specific, tunable acoustic pressures (FIGS. 7A-7B). Since GV collapse causes the rapid dissolution of their gas contents, it was hypothesized that in situ collapse inside acoustofluidic devices would provide a means to instantaneously convert GVs experiencing ARF into an ARF-silent state. This would provide an additional means to spatially pattern GVs inside microfluidic channels, enable them to serve as probes for in situ pressure measurement and be differentially manipulated in space based on their genetically determined collapse pressure thresholds.",
                                "To test the ability of GVs to be patterned based on in situ collapse, an engineered variant of Ana GVs (Ana\u0394C), whose acoustic collapse pressure (FIG. 7B) has been tuned to be lower than wild-type Ana GVs by removing the outer scaffolding protein GvpC, was imaged. Three different driving voltages were applied to the piezoelectric element coupled to the microfluidic channel while the GV sample was infused into the channel at a steady flow rate, and the steady-state distribution of GVs inside the channel was imaged. It was predicted that GVs in regions with acoustic pressures lower than their critical collapse pressure would migrate towards regions of higher pressure due to ARF, while GVs in regions with pressure above their critical threshold would collapse and therefore remain stationary, resulting in the formation of distinct bands (FIG. 7C). Indeed, this pattern was observable starting with the lowest applied voltage (FIG. 7D). As the driving voltage was increased, the location of the material interface shifted toward the middle of the channel, consistent with the expected increase in acoustic pressure across the channel (FIG. 7D and movie data not shown).",
                                "The ability of GVs to assume a pressure-dependent spatial arrangement provides a convenient approach to measuring acoustic pressure inside microfluidic channels. Whereas conventional methods to calibrate such devices by tracking the ARF-induced motion of single-particle standards are laborious, it is relatively straightforward to locate the boundary between migrating and stationary GVs (FIG. 7C). Since this boundary corresponds to the GVs\u2032 known crucial collapse pressure, and the pressure across the channel follows a known sinusoidal function, imaging the location of GV collapse reveals the standing wave pressure profile inside the channel. Comparing the pressure calibrated this way with an established method based on single particle tracking revealed a linear correspondence between the two measurement approaches. The slope is 1.1, indicating that particle tracking slightly underestimates the pressure relative to GVs (FIG. 7E).",
                                "After demonstrating ARF-silencing of a single GV type, it was hypothesized that multiple GV types with different characteristic collapse pressures could be arranged in distinct patterns. Such differential manipulation would be desirable, for example, to enable separate visualization or multiplexed separation of analytes. To test this possibility, either Ana\u0394C GVs or heterologously expressed B. megaterium GVs (Mega GVs), which have critical collapse pressures of 0.6 MPa and 1.9 MPa, respectively, was imaged (FIG. 7F). These GVs in solution were infused into the channel at a steady flow rate and subjected to a standing wave with a maximum acoustic pressure of 1.6 MPa, which should collapse Ana\u0394C but not Mega GVs. As expected, it was observed that the two GV populations followed distinct migration patterns inside the acoustic field (FIG. 7G). These results demonstrate a unique mode of acoustic manipulation enabled by GVs\u2032 genetically engineerable collapse mechanics."

                                "Taken together, these results establish GVs as the first genetically encodable material to enable selective cellular manipulation and patterning with ultrasound. Due to their unique physical properties, GVs have an exceptionally large, negative acoustic contrast factor in aqueous environments, allowing these nanostructures to experience strong ARF despite their submicron size. The expression of GVs inside engineered cells greatly enhances and changes the sign of the force experienced by these cells due to ultrasound, enabling the selective acoustic manipulation and patterning of these cells based on their genotype.",
                                "The methods and compositions provided herein find applications in various areas of biomaterials and biotechnology. First, the ability of GVs and GV-expressing cells to be patterned and manipulated dynamically in 3-D space enables the development of protein- and cell-based materials for applications in tissue engineering, living materials, and stimuli-responsive \u201csmart\u201d materials. In these applications, ultrasound has intrinsic advantages compared to optical, magnetic or printing-based approaches due to its compatibility with opaque media, fine spatial resolution, non-invasive access, simultaneous assembly, and rapid reconfigurability. GV-expressing cells have a unique advantage in such applications due to their negative contrast, simplifying the acoustic field needed for complex patterning. Second, the development of acoustofluidic devices combining ultrasound with microfluidic channels enables the use of GVs to drive the separation of cells based on their gene expression or other biological activity. In these applications, GVs carry a major advantage over fluorescent proteins. Whereas fluorophores provide no intrinsic actuation capability - requiring a separate mechanical step after a fluorescent readout as done one cell at a time in fluorescence-activated cell sorting - the expression or uptake of GVs provides a direct handle for selective acoustic manipulation. This allows cellular patterning or separation to be done en masse.",
                                "The ability of GVs to connect an acoustophoretic phenotype to the output of genetic circuits in both bacterial and mammalian cells enables their expression to designate specific cells for separation, trapping and patterning using ultrasound. Both endogenous and engineered promoters can be connected to gene expression, allowing the formation of GVs to indicate a wide variety of cellular states, based on which the cells can now be selectively manipulated and sorted. Disclosed herein is proof of principle for high-performance cell sorting using GVs as a genetic label. In some embodiments, GVs can be used as exogenous cellular labels. To this end, GVs are readily functionalized with moieties providing the ability to bind specific biomolecular targets. In addition, compared to synthetic materials used to externally functionalize cells for acoustic manipulation, the ability of GVs to be internalized by mammalian cells to enable selective actuation, and subsequently be lysosomally degraded by the same cells, can provide a unique strategy for \u201ctraceless\u201d labeling and cellular actuation.",
                                "These capabilities for selective actuation can extended from in vitro devices to inside living animals or patients using emerging approaches for in vivo ARF. In addition, in some embodiments, GVs can be used as a nanoscale actuator to locally apply specific forces to biological systems. The fN to low pN forces that can be achieved by GVs, while not sufficient to rupture cells, are comparable to forces in processes such as cell-matrix adhesion and the gating of ion channels, which can be useful for studies of mechanosensation or for engineered mechanisms of non-invasive cellular control.",
                                "In some embodiments of the methods and compositions provided herein, GVs are applied to specific biological problems, taking advantage of their potential for biomolecular and genetic engineering. In some embodiments, and without being bound by any particular theory, the basic gradient trapping of GVs and engineered cells generalizes to more complex acoustic fields. In some embodiments, acoustic manipulation of these objects is achieved using traveling acoustic waves to overcome the need for acoustic reflectors. Third, the theoretical model of GV acoustic contrast can vary in some embodiments. The calculations performed in this study approximated that GVs have spherical geometry and that their shell has a constant density and compressibility as a function of applied acoustic pressure. In reality, GVs are anisotropic cylindrical nanostructures that can undergo reversible buckling under applied acoustic pressure. In some embodiments, this buckling behavior enhances the effective compressibility of GVs and thereby the ARF they experience. In some embodiments, theoretical analysis of GV ARF with more realistic geometry and experiments using a broader range of pressures encompassing the buckling regime informs the engineering and use of these biomolecules in ARF applications. In some embodiments, and without being bound by any particular theory, inter-particle interactions arising between GVs and GV-expressing cells in an applied acoustic field influence their clustering, separation and motion. In some embodiments, and without being bound by any particular theory, there can be an interaction of GV ARF and acoustic streaming at higher acoustic frequencies and pressures than those examined herein. As disclosed herein, GV phenotypes can be genetically engineered with size, shape and mechanical properties enhancing their exceptional response to ARF."
