                        "1. Field of the Invention",
                        "The present invention relates to systems, compositions of matter, and techniques for the specific identification and tracking of genes and cells. In particular, the invention relates to positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) reporter genes and reporter probe systems.",
                        "2. Description of Related Art",
                        "Gene and cell-based therapies hold great promise in oncology and many other areas of medicine. In such technologies, targeted therapeutic cells (TCs) or therapeutic transgenes (TGs) can be injected into patients to restore normal organ function in degenerative diseases, eliminate cancer cells, or correct a system malfunction in other diseases. In such contexts, the selection of appropriate cells, optimization of the cells (e.g., in vitro genetic engineering) to perform a specific therapeutic function, and determination of an appropriate administration route and cell dose are necessary to achieve the desired cell therapeutic effect. Similarly, identifying the appropriate transgenes and determining an optimal delivery of the transgenes to target tissues are necessary to achieve the desired gene therapeutic effect. However, achieving these objectives remains a major challenge. Despite decades of research in gene- and cell-based therapies, there are currently no approved products for routine oncological applications in the United States.",
                        "A formidable roadblock in this technology is an inability to routinely monitor the tissue pharmacokinetics (PK) of therapeutic genes and cells and correlate this information with therapeutic outcomes. Most cell/gene therapy trials use invasive biopsy techniques to localize TGs or TCs at target sites. This is a significant problem since tissue biopsies are prone to sampling errors, cannot reveal either whole body therapeutic gene or cell distribution at any one time or alterations in distribution with time. Moreover, biopsies are invasive procedures that may put patients at risk. Inappropriate administration of TCs or TGs based on incomplete and/or unreliable tissue PK data may not yield good treatment efficacy and may lead to severe adverse effects, up to and including lethality (see, e.g. Morgan, R. A., et al. Molecular Therapy (2010) 18 4, 843-851). Thus there is an unmet need for techniques to monitor the whole-body tissue distribution of TCs and TGs\u2014to quantify TCs and to measure TG expression at all locations, non-invasively and sequentially following treatment.",
                        "Unmet needs in this technology are reflected, for example, in the hurdles encountered in clinical trials of Adoptive Cellular Gene Therapy (ACGT) against melanoma. ACGT is a cancer immunotherapy technique under evaluation in multiple FDA-approved clinical trials. In ACGT, billions of patient-derived T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated ex vivo are transplanted back into the patient (the immunological term for T cell transplantation is \u201cadoptive transfer\u201d). Adoptively transferred T cells proliferate, seek out and kill tumor cells (see, e.g. Rosenberg, S. A., et al. Nat Rev Cancer 8:299-308, 2008; FIG. 2A). Building on the pioneering work by Rosenberg and colleagues (see, e.g. Rosenberg, S. A., et al. N Engl J Med 359:1072, 2008), studies have shown that ACGT induces partial responses in patients with advanced melanoma. Unfortunately, these responses are not sustained and most patients relapsed within 6 months. FIG. 2B shows a representative clinical case from one ACGT trial. Sequential [18F]FDG PET scans showed the remarkable anti-tumor activity of ACGT (note the regression of many melanoma lesions), but also identified a resistant lesion. A biopsy of this resistant lesion revealed low numbers of tumor infiltrating therapeutic T cells, presumably because cancer cells at this site lacked the expression of the target antigen. Such findings show that an imaging procedure to detect and quantify therapeutic T cells in melanoma lesions throughout the body is needed to monitor and optimize immune cell-based therapies against melanoma and, by extrapolation, against other cancers.",
                        "An alternative to biopsies is a non-invasive, repeated, quantifiable imaging of therapeutic genes and cells throughout the bodies of living subjects. One such alternative is the use of PET reporter gene (PRG) imaging, which provides a possible solution to the tissue PK measurements problem affecting gene and cell-based therapies. A PRG encodes a protein that mediates the specific cellular accumulation of a PET reporter probe (PRP) labeled with a positron-emitting isotope. Several types of PET reporter gene/probe (PRG-PRP) systems have been developed (see, e.g. FIG. 3 and Min, J. J., et al. Handb Exp Pharmacol, 277-303, 2008). PRG imaging can enable serial, quantitative, and sensitive detection of gene modified therapeutic T cells (and other gene and cell based therapies) in vivo.",
                        "In a typical PET/SPECT reporter gene embodiment, a foreign gene is introduced into cells of interest; the activity of the reporter gene leads to preferential cellular accumulation of a radioactive probe. Cells engineered to express the PET/SPECT reporter gene are in this way \u201ctagged\u201d and their presence can be detected and quantified at various locations within the body using PET or SPECT. Alternatively, PET/SPECT reporter gene systems can be used to study gene expression in vivo. This is accomplished by placing the reporter gene downstream from a promoter or regulatory region of interest. While numerous PET/SPECT reporter gene systems have been described in recent years, most of them are based on one of the following mechanisms: (i) enzymatic modification of the PET/SPECT probe followed by intracellular trapping; (ii) accumulation via plasma membrane transport mechanisms; and, (iii), cell surface receptor mapping using radioactive ligands or monoclonal antibody fragments. A brief summary of conventional PET reporter gene systems and probes is presented in FIG. 22. Further description of PET/SPECT reporter gene technologies are covered, for example, in Gambhir, S. S, and S. S. Yaghoubi, Eds. (2010), Molecular Imaging With Reporter Genes, Cambridge Molecular Imaging, Cambridge University Press.",
                        "Various molecular imaging groups have worked to develop PRG-PRP techniques for non-invasively, repeatedly and quantitatively measuring gene expression in living animals. One of the first studies developed Dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) as a PRG, and 3-(2\u2032[18F]fluoroethyl)spiperone (FESP)\u2014a ligand that binds to the D2R\u2014as the PRP (see, e.g. FIG. 3 and MacLaren, D. C., et al. Gene Ther 6:785-791, 1999). To convert the D2R system to a reporter with no biological activity, a mutant D2R gene (D2R80A) in which ligand binding is uncoupled from signal transduction was developed as a \u201csecond generation\u201d D2R PRG (see, e.g. Liang, Q., et al. Gene Ther 8:1490-1498, 2001). The D2R80A PRG was noted to work well when expressed from strong promoters (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., et al. J Nucl Med 39:2003-2011, 1998). However, its sensitivity was inadequate for many imaging applications. Because receptor-ligand PRG-PRP systems are stoichiometric, catalytic enzyme-substrate PRG-PRP systems would be preferred.",
                        "Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) has also been developed as a catalytic PRG and 18F-labeled fluoroganciclovir (FGCV) as a PRP (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., et al. J Nucl Med 39:2003-2011, 1998). Similar studies are known in the art (see, e.g. Tjuvajev, J. G., et al. Cancer Res 58:4333-4341, 1998). To increase sensitivity, researchers searched for \u201csecond generation\u201d HSV1-tk reporter genes that utilized acycloguanosines more effectively, and thymidine (the \u201cnatural\u201d substrate) less effectively, and identified HSV1-sr39tk as a substantially more sensitive PRG (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:2785-2790, 2000). To improve the PRG-PRP system further, researchers tested a series of 18F-labelled acycloguanosines and determined their relative efficacies as PRPs with HSV1-sr39tk (see, e.g. Min, J. J., et al. Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging 30:1547-1560, 2003; Yaghoubi, S., et al. J Nucl Med 42:1225-1234, 2001). 9-[(4-[18F]fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine (FHBG) was identified in these studies. Human FHBG PK and dosimetry studies have been conducted in preparation for clinical trials (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, S., et al. J Nucl Med 42:1225-1234, 2001), to participate in comparative quantification of the D2R80A and HSV1-sr39tk reporter systems (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, S. S., et al. Gene Ther 8:1072-1080, 2001), and to use FHBG to monitor the progress of HSV1-sr39tk/ganciclovir suicide gene therapy in cancer (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, S. S., et al. Cancer Gene Ther 12:329-339, 2005). The development of \u201csecond generation\u201d PRG-PRPs for the HSV1-tk and D2R systems demonstrates an early and continued commitment to optimizing PRG-PRP pairings, for experimental and clinical applications.",
                        "The HSV1-sr39tk/FHBG system is the current standard of comparison in evaluating new PRG-PRP combinations. The gold standard for PRG imaging is the viral HSV1-tk and sr39tk, its optimized analog (see, e.g. Min, J. J., et al. Handb Exp Pharmacol, 277-303, 2008). The advantages of HSV1-tk over other PRGs are its high sensitivity and dual function as a suicide/safety gene. However, its main disadvantage is immunogenicity, due to the very low sequence homology (\u02dc10%, see, e.g. Eriksson, S., et al. Cell Mol Life Sci 59, 1327-1346, 2002) between the viral protein and human nucleoside kinases. FIG. 5 illustrates the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HSV1-tk immunogenicity and the potential detrimental effects of immunogenicity on treatment efficacy. The immunogenicity of HSV1-tk has been documented in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants in leukemic patients (see, e.g. Riddell, S. R., et al. Nat Med 2:216-223, 1996; Bonini, C., et al. Science 276:1719-1724, 1997; Tiberghien, P., et al. Blood 97:63-72, 2001). A significant incidence of immune responses occurs against HSV1-tk, accompanied by a decrease in the number of circulating therapeutic cells (see, e.g. Bonini, C., et al. Science 276:1719-1724, 1997; Verzeletti, S., et al. Hum Gene Ther 9:2243-2251, 1998). Even more substantial immune responses were reported following infusion of HSV1-tk modified donor T cells in immunocompetent patients (see, e.g. Berger, C., et al. Blood 107:2294-2302, 2006).",
                        "One solution to the immunogenicity problem is to replace the viral PRG with human PRGs. Several human-gene derived PRGs have been investigated including D2R (see, e.g. Liang, Q., et al. Gene Ther 8:1490-1498, 2001), human somatostatin receptor 2 (hSSR2) (see, e.g. Rogers, B. E., et al. J Nucl Med 46:1889-1897, 2005), sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (see, e.g. Che, J., et al. Mol Imaging 4:128-136, 2005), human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) (see, e.g. Buursma, A. R., et al. J Nucl Med 46:2068-2075, 2005; Moroz, M. A., et al. J Nucl Med 48:827-836, 2007), truncated human thymidine kinase 2 (hTK2) (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. J Nucl Med 48:819-826, 2007), and human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (see, e.g. Likar, Y., et al. J Nucl Med 51:1395-1403, 2010). Since direct comparisons are lacking, it is not known how hSSR2, D2R, and NIS compare to HSV1-sr39tk. The un-mutated hTK2 PRG is significantly less sensitive than sr39tk (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. J Nucl Med 48:819-826, 2007). hNET has comparable or slightly lower sensitivity than HSV1-tk, with both PRGs enabling detection by microPET of as few as 104 CTLs injected into tumor xenografts (see, e.g. Doubrovin, M. M., et al. Cancer Res 67:11959-11969, 2007). However, using the hNET/[124I]MIBG system for clinical imaging may require the development of 18F-labeled probes, since 124I has a long half-life and patients may be exposed to high doses of radiation.",
                        "For the reasons noted above, there is a need in the art for novel PET reporter gene/reporter probe systems. Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein meet this as well as other needs."

For example, embedding PET reporter gene imaging in clinical trials of cell and gene therapies can be used to prevent \u201cblinded\u201d attempts to optimize these therapies. Embodiments of the invention also provide the means to detect the occurrence of adverse physiological phenomena, such as malignant transformation of cells and autoimmune-mediated destruction of normal tissues. The PET reporter gene (PRG) based imaging kits described herein further have the benefit of encouraging those of skill in cellular and gene therapy technologies to apply long-term non-invasive molecular imaging to pharmacokinetic studies.",
                        "As discussed below, embodiments of the invention disclosed herein can addresses key limitations of current PRG technologies. In particular, instead of the commonly used highly immunogenic viral proteins of conventional PRGs, a number novel PET reporters based on fully human proteins are disclosed herein. The use of human genes in embodiments of the invention significantly reduces the probability of patients developing immunity against therapeutic cells (and other delivery systems) engineered to express PRGs, one of the most significant challenges to the clinical implementation of current PRGs. The disclosure further describes the effect of reporter gene expression on nucleotide pools.",
                        "In typical embodiments of the invention, a PET/SPECT reporter gene uses an enhanced version of human mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (htk2) expressed in cytoplasm to preferentially trap novel PET/SPECT radiolabeled L and D-enantiomer analogs of thymidine, a natural substrate. Endogenous hTK2 enzyme provides the first phosphorylation step in the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleosides. In one exemplary embodiment, the enhanced htk2 is not immunogenic in humans. In addition, the enhanced htk2 reporter gene can serve as a safety gene to destroy cells expressing it when they malfunction. A method is also provided for mutating the htk2 gene to enhance the catalytic activity of its enzyme product for the phosphorylation of several thymidine analogs or to decrease the catalytic activity of its enzyme product for the phosphorylation of D-enantiomer thymidine.",

One embodiment of the invention comprises a human thymidine kinase 2 polypeptide comprising amino acid residues 51-265 of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein the thymidine kinase polypeptide comprises an amino acid substitution at amino acid residue position 93 and/or amino acid residue position 109 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In typical embodiment, the thymidine kinase polypeptide is designed or selected to exhibit a certain functional activity, for example a decreased susceptibility to thymidine triphosphate mediated feedback inhibition as compared to wild type polypeptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, an ability to phosphorylate 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-18F-5-methyl-1-\u03b2-L-arabinofuranosyluracil, or the like.

For either \u201cgene therapy\u201d, or for \u201ccell therapy\u201d, one would also want an imaging technology to localize and quantify the therapeutic product throughout the body.",
                        "Positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene imaging can be used to non-invasively monitor cell-based therapies. Therapeutic cells engineered to express a PET reporter gene (PRG) specifically accumulate a PET reporter probe (PRP) and can be detected by PET imaging. Expanding the utility of this technology requires the development of new non-immunogenic PRGs. In one embodiment of the present invention, a PRG-PRP system is provided that employs, as the PRG, a mutated form of human thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-18F-5-methyl-1-O-L-arabinofuranosyluracil (L-18F-FMAU) as the PRP. In one embodiment, a TK2 double mutant (TK2-N93D/L109F) is provided that efficiently phosphorylates L-18F-FMAU. The N93D/L109F TK2 mutant has lower activity for the endogenous nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine than wild type TK2, and its ectopic expression in therapeutic cells is not expected to alter nucleotide metabolism. Imaging studies in mice indicate that the sensitivity of the new human TK2-N93D/L109F PRG is comparable with that of a widely used PRG based on the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase.",
                        "Development of PET reporter gene systems is a highly dynamic and innovative field in molecular imaging. The development of the hTK2-N93D PRG provided herein, started with an innovative concept wherein development of a new catalytic PET reporter system should not start with the PRG component, but rather with the identification of candidate PRPs. Only after the identification of optimal PRPs, should PRGs be engineered to provide maximal sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, PRPs should satisfy two criteria: (i) the probe should be amenable to routine 18F labeling, and (ii) the probe should demonstrate a high specific signal-to-background ratio. Furthermore, following injection, the candidate PRP should have access to the tissues but should also be rapidly cleared if the PRG is not expressed (i.e., the PRP should accumulate rapidly and specifically only in cells and tissues genetically engineered to express the PRG).",

In addition, the enhanced htk2 reporter gene can serve as a safety gene to destroy cells expressing it when they malfunction. Endogenous hTK2 enzyme provides the first phosphorylation step in the salvage pathway of deoxyribonucleosides. A method is also provided for mutating the htk2 gene to enhance the catalytic activity of its enzyme product for phosphorylation of several thymidine analogs.",

The advantage of tk2-N93D is that it should have a significantly lower immunogenicity in humans compared to viral TK polypeptides (e.g. as PET reporter genes of viral origin HSV1-sr39tk are typically observed to be immunogenic in humans). The invention also has applications in gene therapy and general biomedical research in discovering intracellular events and analysis of the mechanisms of the actions of therapeutic agents.

First, the PET/SPECT reporter genes are based on a human gene and thus are less likely to induce unwanted immune responses if used in human subjects. Second, the invention includes novel L-enantiomers of thymidine analogs that have improved pharmacokinetics, because as unnatural substrates of mammalian TK enzymes they have much less background accumulation; hence superior signal-to-noise ratio in vivo compared to existing probes.",

In addition, their ability to tag cells for kinetics monitoring makes them useful for applications beyond just monitoring pharmacokinetics of therapeutic cells. These PRGs can be used to monitor kinetics of almost any type of cell that has been genetically engineered to express them either in vitro or in vivo. For example, they can also be used to track metastasis of tumor cells or migration and proliferation of human immune cells, for diagnostic or investigational purposes.

To identify PRP candidates with rapid clearance from normal tissues and low overall background (second criterion for PRGs), biodistribution studies in mice were performed. It was observed that natural (D) nucleosides had higher background than non-natural (L) nucleoside analogs. Amongst the tested candidate probes, L-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FEAU had the lowest overall background limited to clearance routes such as bladder, gall bladder, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (FIG. 7B). Furthermore, increasing the L-[18F]FMAU uptake time from 1 to 3 hours almost completely eliminated the non-specific GI signals (see FIG. 10). The next step was to identify a human nucleoside kinase that phosphorylates L-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FEAU, and can be converted into a new PRG that matches four criteria:",

                                "4. The PRG should be biologically inert. Expression of the nucleoside kinase PRG should not alter cytosolic deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools, since this may result in genomic instability (see, e.g. Mathews, C.K. FASEB J 20:1300-1314, 2006) and impaired cell division (see, e.g. Reichard, P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57:349-374, 1988). This potential complication is often not considered adequately in developing PRG-PRP systems based on nucleoside kinases.",
                                "To identify candidate PRGs, the human nucleoside kinases: TK2, dGK, dCK and TK1 were considered (see Table 1 below). These kinases should lack immunogenicity (criterion 1 for PRGs), since they are expressed in human tissues (see, e.g. Amer, E. S., et al. Pharmacol Ther 67:155-186, 1995). As shown in Table 1, arguments can be constructed against and in favor of using any of these kinases as PRGs (see, e.g. Eriksson, S., et al. Cell Mol Life Sci 59, 1327-1346, 2002; Amer, E. S., et al. Pharmacol Ther 67, 155-186, 1995; Wang, J., et al. Biochemistry 38, 16993-16999, 1999; Liu, S. H., et al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 42, 833-839, 1998; Wang, J., et al. Biochem Pharmacol 59, 1583-1588, 2000; Al-Madhoun, A. S., et al. Mini Rev Med Chem 4, 341-350, 2004; Wang, J., et al. Nucleosides Nucleotides 18, 807-810, 1999). It was reasoned that TK2 (which is normally expressed in the mitochondria\u2014thus matching criterion 2 for PRGs) was the best choice. After truncating the sequence encoding the mitochondrial signal peptide (to target the PRG to the cytosol where it is directly accessible to the PRP), the TK2-based PRG is only 648 base pairs, an optimal size for viral and non-viral vectors (thus matching criterion 3 for PRGs). TK2 has a potential drawback: this kinase is regulated by thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) as part of a protective mechanism against imbalances in mitochondrial dNTP pools (see, e.g. Mikkelsen, N. E., et al. Biochemistry 42:5706-5712, 2003) Inhibition of a TK2-based PRG by dTTP could be problematic when imaging dividing therapeutic cells (e.g. intracellular dNTP pools in proliferating T cells are \u02dc30-foldhigher than resting lymphocytes (see, e.g. Cohen, A., et al. J Biol Chem 258:12334-12340, 1983) and such elevated levels are sufficient to inhibit TK2 activity, as shown in FIG. 8A).",
                                "To overcome the negative feedback limitation of TK2, a point mutation-N93D, was engineered. The work done by Piskur and colleagues on the structurally related Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (see, e.g. Welin, M., et al. FEBS J 272:3733-3742, 2005) led one to predict that the N93D mutation would reduce the feedback inhibition of TK2 by dTTP. This prediction was confirmed by a comparison between the wild type (WT) and the TK2-N93D mutant in a kinase assay in which increasing concentrations of dTTP were added to inhibit TK2 enzymatic activity (FIG. 8B). We then determined whether the enhanced resistance to feedback inhibition translates into improved TK2-N93D catalytic activity towards the L-[18F]FMAU substrate. The murine leukemic cell line L1210 was engineered to express the WT and mutated PRG. PRG-expressing L1210 cell lines were sorted to similar levels of gene expression, using enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) as a co-linked fluorescent marker. TK2-N93D transduced cells showed an increased accumulation of L-[18F]FMAU PRP compared to WT TK2 transduced cells (FIG. 8C). It was also examined whether the expression of TK2-N93D had detrimental effects on cellular physiology (criterion 4 for PRGs). TK2-N93D expression did not affect the growth rate of transduced cells (FIG. 9A) or intracellular dNTP pools (FIG. 9C). In contrast, sr39tk overexpression induced a 4-fold increase in dTTP pools (FIG. 9C). Moreover, when thymidine (dT) was added to the culture media at concentrations normally found in mouse serum, the proliferation of sr39tk+ cells was significantly impaired (FIG. 9B), presumably as a result of significant imbalances in dNTP pools induced by sr39tk overexpression (FIG. 9D). These findings provide evidence that the utility of sr39tk is limited not only by its immunogenicity but also by its effects on normal cellular physiology.",
                                "To compare TK2, TK2-N93D and HSV1-sr39tk in vivo, PRG-expressing L1210 cells were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice that were then scanned with L-[18F]FMAU (FIG. 10A) and [18F]FHBG (FIG. 10C) on consecutive days. TK2-N93D showed improved accumulation of L-[18F]FMAU compared to WT TK2 (FIG. 10B). Signals obtained with sr39tk were slightly higher than those obtained with the human TK2-N93D PRG (the difference was not statistically significant). Neither WT TK2 nor TK2-N93D expressing tumors accumulated detectable amounts of [18F]FHBG (FIG. 10D). L-[18F]FMAU accumulation in TK2-N93D transduced tumors was \u02dc20 times higher than the accumulation in tumors transduced with the control (eYFP only) vector. While this ratio is higher than the 6.67 ratio reported for WT TK2 as a PRG with D-[18F]FEAU as the PRP (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. J Nucl Med 48:819-826, 2007), the HSV1-sr39tk/[18F]FHBG combination still outperforms the TK2-N93D/L-[18F]FMAU combination by \u02dc2-fold. The significance of the 2-fold difference for the sensitivity of the new TK2-N93D PRG can be further investigated in the animal models discussed below (see, e.g. Gerth, M. L., et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 354:802-807, 2007; Liu, L., et al. Nucleic Acids Res 37:4472-4481, 2009; Iyidogan, P., et al. Biochemistry 47:4711-4720, 2008; Lutz, S., et al.

                                "Although the L-[18F]FMAU preliminary data is promising, the second candidate PRP, L-[18F]FEAU was also investigated. The rationale to analyze L-[18F]FEAU is twofold: a) it is possible that TK2-N93D has a higher affinity for L-FEAU than for L-FMAU\u2014if correct, then L-[18F]FEAU may be more sensitive; b) for a given PRP, the biodistribution pattern in mice may not predict its biodistribution in humans; it is thus conceivable that human biodistribution studies will reveal that L-[18F]FEAU is a better PRP than L-[18F]FMAU. In addition to the cell culture and in vivo studies described in Sect. 1.1 (FIGS. 8-10), one can also compare L-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FEAU in the adenovirus liver transduction model, as described below.",

                                "The Ad-liver model described in Sect. 1.2.2. provides the means to rank various PRG-PRP combinations, before testing them in more elaborate hepatic metastases and melanoma targeting strategies. Adenovirus delivery of PRPs to the liver to evaluate PRP-PRG systems eliminates the heterogeneity of target size for PRG delivery encountered with tumors; it also eliminates heterogeneity in target vascularity (a confounding problem for both reporter and probe delivery), and minimizes differences in delivery of therapeutic genes. It is the most reproducible and quantifiable assay with the least number of biological variables. The amount of vector, PRG and target are quantifiable at the end. One can use Ad.CMV.HSV1sr39tk/FHBG as \u201creference\u201d, and can construct viruses with the identical structure\u2014with the exception that experimental PRGs can be substituted for sr39tk and experimental PRPs can be substituted for FHBG (see FIG. 3B for an example of this approach). To construct and titer the Ad.CMV viruses with alternative PRGs one can use the Invitrogen Gateway cloning system. One can insert the reporter gene into the \u201centry vector\u201d, and incubate together with the \u201cdestination vector\u201d (an Ad5 backbone with the E1 and E3 regions deleted), along with lambda integrase. Identical vectors have been cloned expressing firefly luciferase (fLuc), two modified fLucs, Renilla luciferase (rLuc), a red-shifted rLuc, membrane-bound Gaussia luciferase and GFP, to compare their optical imaging characteristics in the Ad:liver protocol. To compare reference and experimental viruses, groups of three mice can be injected intravenously with 108 Ad.CMV.HSVlsr39tK infectious units (ifu), 108 experimental Ad ifu, 1010 Ad.CMV.HSVlsr39tK ifu, and 1010 experimental Ad ifu (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69, 554-564, 2009, demonstrating that three mice per group can give statistically reliable data). Thus, for each experimental PRG one can run simultaneous, parallel cohorts with Ad.CMV.HSVlsr39tk/FHBG, to provide an internal standard for experimental PRG/PRP comparison. Three days after virus administration, mice can receive 200 \u03bcCi of the appropriate PRP (e.g. FHBG, L-[18F]FMAU, L-[18F]FEAU), and can be scanned by microPET/CT. Following imaging, the mice can be euthanized and the livers can be homogenized. Ad genomes and murine liver genomes can be measured by qPCR (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69:554-564, 2009). PRG enzyme assays can also be performed. Non-invasive PRG-PRP imaging data and in vitro enzyme activities can be normalized to viral genomes/liver and compared for the reference and experimental PRGs. Using a low (108 ifu) and high (1010 ifu) dose of PRG-expressing vector can give us an initial estimate of sensitivity and dynamic range for each experimental PRG-PRP system. This protocol can also provide a simultaneous internal comparison of biodistribution and tissue background for L-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FEAU, relative to FHBG.",

                                "Although huTK2-N93D closely resembles the endogenous TK2 protein and will therefore be less immunogenic in humans than viral TK polypeptides, it cannot be assumed that this PRG completely lacks immunogenicity in humans. Not only the N93D mutation may render TK2-N93D immunogenic but also its overexpression may break immunological tolerance. The immunogenicity of an intracellular protein (such as TK2-N93D) is primarily determined by the presentation of short antigenic peptides on the cell surface in the context of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules and by the presence in the host immune repertoire of CD8+ T cells that express a T cell receptor (TCR) able to recognize the peptide-MHC class I complexes. Abolishing peptide-MHC presentation should eliminate the immunogenicity of any given protein. One can use in silico methods to determine the epitopes contained within the TK2-N93D PRG that can be presented by host MHC class I molecules. Several algorithms are available to obtain this information: SYFPEITHI (see, e.g. Rammensee, H., et al. Immunogenetics 50:213-219, 1999), NetMHC (see, e.g. Lundegaard, C., et al. Nucleic Acids Res 36:W509-512, 2008), NIH BIMAS (see, e.g. Parker, K. C., et al. J Immunol 152:163-175, 1994) and Rankpep (see, e.g. Reche, P. A., et al. Hum Immunol 63:701-709, 2002). One can use the consensus values obtained from these algorithms to identify all the potential HLA-A2-binding epitopes encoded by TK2-N93D. Given its predominance in humans, one focuses on the HLA-A2 allele; however, similar approaches are applicable to all human or mouse MHC haplotypes. A fluorescence-polarization assay (see, e.g. Bakker, A. H., et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:3825-3830, 2008) can be used to validate the binding affinity for HLA-A2 of the in silico predicted binders. One can then design mutations in the identified TK2 encoded epitopes that can abolish their binding to HLA-A2 (and therefore eliminate the immunogenicity of TK2-N93D). The affinity of the mutants for L-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FEAU and their efficacy as PRGs in vivo in the Ad:liver model can be determined as described in Sect. 1.2.2.",

Because COX-2 is expressed in CRCs and not expressed in liver (see, e.g. Fujita, T., et al. Cancer Res 58:4823-4826, 1998; Ishikawa, T. O., et al. Mol Imaging Biol 8:171-187, 2006), Cox2 \u201ctranscriptional restriction\u201d results in an \u02dc24 fold difference in reporter gene expression in CRC metastases versus liver (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69:554-564, 2009). Human LS174T (rLuc) CRC cells (106) can be injected into the upper left liver lobe of nu/nu mice (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 67:5354-5361, 2007). One can monitor tumor burden weekly by optical imaging (see, e.g. Liang, Q., et al. Mol Imaging Biol 6:385-394, 2004), using the rLuc substrate coelenterazine. Tumor burden is reproducible and easily measurable at three weeks (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69:554-564, 2009). At this time, groups of three mice can be injected with 108 Ad.Cox2HSVlsr39tk ifu, 108 experimental-PRG Ad ifu, 1010 Ad.Cox2HSVlsr39tk ifu or 1010 experimental-PRG Ad ifu. Three days later, mice can be injected with the appropriate PRP and imaged by microPET/CT. The following day mice can be imaged with [18F]FDG. [18F]PRP:[18F]FDG hepatic retention ratios can provide a non-invasive analysis of the sensitivity, and provide an indication of the dynamic range, of the experimental PRG-PRP system versus the HSVlsr39tk/FHBG system. After imaging, mice can be euthanized, and PRG enzyme activities in liver homogenates can be assayed. Adenovirus genomes, human genomes (to measure the tumor burden) and murine liver genomes (to normalize data) can be monitored by PCR (see, e.g. Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69:554-564, 2009). These data will provide direct and quantitative comparisons of the sensitivity of experimental PRG-PRP systems in detecting colorectal cancer liver metastases. The data on relative efficacy and sensitivity of alternate PRG-PRP systems can be extrapolated to any PRG delivery system.",

                                "The Pmel-1/B16 model (see, e.g. Overwijk, W. W., et al. J Exp Med 198:569-580, 2003) is extensively used by many groups working in the field of tumor immunology (see, e.g. Finkelstein, S. E., et al. J Leukoc Biol 76:333-337, 2004)). It closely resembles the ACGT clinical procedure shown in FIG. 2. Rejection of established murine B16 melanoma tumors is achieved by a combined immunotherapy protocol using CD8+ T cells (obtained from the Pmel-1 transgenic mice and specific for the self/tumor antigen gp100 present on B16 cells) (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. J Nucl Med 48, 819-826, 2007; Likar, Y., et al. J Nucl Med 51, 1395-1403, 2010; Doubrovin, M. M., et al. Cancer Res 67, 11959-11969, 2007; Li, H. J., et al. Cancer Res 69, 554-564, 2009; Mathews, C.

Biochemistry 42, 5706-5712, 2003; Cohen, A., et al. J Biol Chem 258, 12334-12340, 1983). T cells are adoptively transferred in tumor bearing mice, which are also treated with lymphodepletion (500 cGy), dendritic cell (DC) vaccination and high dose systemic IL-2 administration (see, e.g. Liu, S., et al. Int Immunol 19:1213-1221, 2007; Liu, Y. L., et al. Journal of the Formosan Medical Association=Taiwan yi zhi 108:587-591, 2009; Overwijk, W. W., et al. J Exp Med 188:277-286, 1998; Sikora, A. G., et al. J Immunol 182:7398-7407, 2009). In a previous study, CD8+ T Pmel-1 T cells were transduced with a multicistronic retroviral vector encoding sr39tk and eYFP (to allow ex vivo detection of transduced cells by FACS) (see, e.g. Shu, C. J., et al. Int Immunol 21:155-165, 2009). Transduced cells were adoptively transferred in lymphodepleted BL/6 mice bearing B16 melanoma. Recipient mice were serially imaged by [18F]FHBG microPET/CT. In vivo quantification of [18F]FHBG accumulation in spleen and lymph nodes correlated with numbers of sr39tk+eYFP+ T cells present at these sites (measured ex vivo by FACS). The lower limit of detection for PRG imaging in this model was \u02dc1\u00d7104 sr39tk+ T cells in a lymph node with a volume of 1-2 mm3. These findings provide evidence that the PRG-PRP technology can be used to detect populations of cells that represent less than 5% of the total number of cells in the imaged lymph node. One can use the Pmel-1/B16 ACGT model to determine whether one can achieve the same, if not better, lower limit of detection as that obtained with sr39tk and FHBG using the new, non-immunogenic PRG systems. Based on previous work, it is estimated that 4-6 mice per group will be needed to obtain statistically significant values.",

                                "Since Ad-CRC liver metastasis and melanoma cell-based immunotherapy animal models are routinely used in the laboratories, one does not anticipate any difficulties. It is possible however that data from these models will indicate that new PRG-PRP systems are less sensitive than the current HSV1-sr39tk/FHBG gold standard. Due to this possibility, one can collaborate with other laboratories to identify new TK2 mutants with improved catalytic activity towards L-FMAU and L-FEAU.",
                                "As yet another contingency plan, collaborative studies with the structure of nucleoside kinases have also been initiated. A number of new human TK2 mutants have been identified for improving the affinity and specificity for 18F-L-FMAU. The rationale behind the design of these new mutants was to improve the affinity of TK2 for L-nucleosides at the expense of the endogenous (natural) substrates that are in the D-nucleoside configuration. The new mutants suggested on both the wild type and N93D TK2 backbone have been generated. It has been found that one of the double mutants (TK2 N93D/L109F, referred to as \u201c\u0394TK2-DB\u201d in FIG. 11) is significantly more sensitive than N93D TK2 (FIG. 11). This finding confirms that improvements of the hTK2 N93D system are possible."

Advances in Genetics 54:179-187, 2005). \u03a6C31 integrase is functional in mammalian cells (see, e.g. Calos, M. P. Current Gene Therapy 6:633-645, 2006).",
                                "The enzyme recognizes two \u02dc30 base pair sequences, attB and attP. When plasmids carrying both attB and \u03a6C31 integrase (pCMV-Int) are introduced into mammalian cells, the enzyme carries out sequence-specific recombination with chromosomal sequences (pseudo attP sites) that resemble attP. Approximately 100 potential integration sites, have been identified, most of which are intergenic and none are near known cancer genes; thus oncogene activation is unlikely (see, e.g. Chalberg, T. W., et al. Journal of Molecular Biology 357:28-48, 2006). \u03a6C31 integrase typically generates only one integration event per cell (see, e.g. Chalberg, T. W., et al. Journal of Molecular Biology 357:28-48, 2006). Studies have demonstrated integration and expression of multiple genes carried on a single plasmid (see, e.g. Calos, M. P. Current Gene Therapy 6:633-645, 2006). Table 2 describes a proposed plan for developing non-viral PRG delivery kits. The final products are four Ready-To-Use \u03a6C31 integrase-based PRG cell-labeling kits containing the two essential plasmids, nucleofection reagents, and optimized protocols. These kits can allow delivery of either TK2-N93D or sr39tk to mouse T cells and to hMSCs.",

One recognizes that direct injections into tumor lesions lack clinical relevance. However, this approach is only intended for the initial determination of conversion factors, which can then be validated in the clinically relevant models described above. PRG expression per cell can be determined immediately prior to injection. Four hours after TC injection, mice can receive L-[18F]FMAU and can be scanned three hours after tracer injection. L-[18F]FMAU percent injected dose (% ID) can be measured within an ROI drawn over the entire xenograft; % ID/tumor can be calculated. One can use >3 mice per group to obtain statistically significant values. These measurements can be related to cell numbers and normalized by cell expression level, to obtain conversion factors to estimate TC numbers present in tumor xenografts, based on L-[18F]FMAU/FEAU signal intensity.",

Thus, approval has been obtained to perform the first ever L-[18F]FMAU whole-body PET/CT imaging in a healthy human volunteer. The image (FIG. 12) is extremely promising, since, compared to FHBG, L-[18F]FMAU shows very low tracer background within the abdomen and pelvis. This is a significant advantage over FHBG, which has high abdominal background in both mice and humans. It has also been learned that cell trafficking to liver and heart might be difficult to monitor using L-[18F]FMAU (since this probe accumulates in these tissues even in healthy volunteers).

European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging 35:1480-1488, 2008). L-[18F]FMAU uptake may also increase in tumors that experience mitochondrial stress and this may interfere with the detection at these sites of therapeutic cells genetically labeled with the new mutant TK2 reporter genes. One can use previously described experimental approaches (see, e.g. Tehrani, O, S., et al. European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging 35:1480-1488, 2008) to compare under conditions of mitochondrial stress the uptake of D-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FMAU by cells that express the mutant TK2 PRGs or vector (eYFP only) control. One expects that overexpression of a PRG optimized for L-[18F]FMAU and engineered to localize in the cytosol will allow these cells to accumulate much higher amounts of L-[18F]FMAU than those accumulated by control cells via the expression of endogenous TK2. If this is not the case, one can focus on L-[18F]FEAU, the other candidate PET reporter gene described in this application. Compared to D-[18F]FMAU and L-[18F]FMAU, L-[18F]FEAU is expected to have much lower affinity for endogenous human TK2 and thus its uptake in tumors should be insensitive to mitochondrial stress.",

                                "**Illustrative Use of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Reporter Gene Imaging to Non-Invasively Monitor Cell-Based Therapies**",
                                "Positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene imaging can be used to non-invasively monitor cell-based therapies. Therapeutic cells engineered to express a PET reporter gene (PRG) specifically accumulate a PET reporter probe (PRP) and can be detected by PET imaging. Expanding the utility of this technology requires the development of new non-immunogenic PRGs. Here, a new PRG-PRP system is described that employs, as the PRG, a mutated form of human thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-18F-5-methyl-1-\u03b2-L-arabinofuranosyluracil (L-18F-FMAU) as the PRP. L-18F-FMAU was identified as a candidate PRP and its biodistribution was determined in mice and humans. Using structure-guided enzyme engineering, a TK2 double mutant (TK2-N93D/L109F) was generated that efficiently phosphorylates L-18F-FMAU. The N93D/L109F TK2 mutant has lower activity for the endogenous nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine than wild type TK2, and its ectopic expression in therapeutic cells is not expected to alter nucleotide metabolism. Imaging studies in mice indicate that the sensitivity of the new human TK2-N93D/L109F PRG is comparable with that of a widely used PRG based on the herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase. These findings provide evidence that the TK2-N93D/L109F/L-18F-FMAU PRG-PRP system is useful in preclinical and clinical applications of cell-based therapies.",
                                "The inability to routinely monitor the tissue pharmacokinetics of therapeutic genes and cells and correlate this information with therapeutic outcomes represents a significant roadblock in the clinical adoption of these emerging therapies. Most cell/gene therapy trials use invasive biopsy techniques to localize therapeutic genes or therapeutic cells at target sites. However, invasive techniques are prone to sampling errors and carry risks for the patients. There is an unmet need for techniques to monitor the whole-body tissue distribution of therapeutic cells and therapeutic genes, to quantify therapeutic cells, and to measure therapeutic gene expression at all locations non-invasively and sequentially after treatment.",
                                "This unmet need can be addressed by PET3 reporter gene (PRG) imaging (see, e.g. Herschman, H. R. (2004) Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 51, 191-204). A PRG encodes a protein that mediates the specific accumulation of a PET reporter probe (PRP) labeled with a positron-emitting isotope (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., and Yaghoubi, S. S. (eds) (2010) Molecular Imaging With Reporter Genes, pp. 258-274, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK). Such non-invasive PET measurements may predict and/or evaluate treatment efficacy and the risk of side effects; they can provide information that complements data obtained using invasive techniques, such as serial biopsies (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., and Yaghoubi, S. S. (eds) (2010) Molecular Imaging With Reporter Genes, pp. 258-274, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK). PRGs developed to date encode proteins with various activities, including enzymes, transporters, and receptors (for review, see, e.g. Nair-Gill, E. D., et al. (2010) in Molecular Imaging with Reporter Genes (Gambhir, S. S., and Yaghoubi, S. S., eds) pp. 258-274. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK). In theory, enzyme-encoding PRGs should have the highest sensitivity among different classes of PRGs as a result of signal amplification by the catalytic turnover of the enzymatic reaction that traps the probe.",
                                "The most commonly used PRGs are based on herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) (see, e.g. Tjuvajev, J. G., et al. (1996) Cancer Res. 56, 4087-4095) and its optimized mutant, sr39tk (see, e.g. Gambhir, S. S., et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97, 2785-2790). Both wild type (WT) HSV1-tk and sr39tk have been used to study the kinetics of therapeutic cells in preclinical settings (see, e.g. Shu, C. J., et al. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 17412-17417; Yaghoubi, S. S., et al. (2007) J. Biomed. Opt. 12, 064025; Wu, J. C., et al. (2003) Circulation 108, 1302-1305; Hung, S. C., et al. (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11, 7749-7756). Several PRPs can be used to image cells engineered to express HSV1-tk-based PRGs: 9-[4-18F-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine (18F-FHBG) (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, S. S., et al. (2009) Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 6, 53-58; Pe\u00f1uelas, I., et al. (2005) Gastroenterology 128, 1787-1795; Yaghoubi, et al. (2001) J. Nucl. Med. 42, 1225-1234), 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-18F-5-ethyl-1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (18F-FEAU) (see, e.g. Chin, F. T., et al. (2008) Mol. Imaging. Biol. 10, 82-91; Miyagawa, T., et al. (2008) J. Nucl. Med. 49, 637-648; Alauddin, M. M., et al. (2007) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 34, 822-829), and 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-18F-5-iodo-1-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (18F-FIAU) (see, e.g. Alauddin, M. M., et al. (2007) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 34, 822-829). To date, HSV1-tk is the only PRG that has been used to image therapeutic cells in patients (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, S. S., et al. (2009) Nat. Clin. Pract. Oncol. 6, 53-58).",
                                "The main disadvantage of HSV1-tk as a PRG is its immunogenicity, which can lead to immune-mediated elimination of therapeutic cells. This phenomenon has been documented in clinical trials (see, e.g. Traversari, C., et al. (2007) Blood 109, 4708-4715; Berger, C., et al. (2006) Blood 107, 2294-2302). The immunogenicity problem may be solved by replacing the viral kinase with a human orthologue (see, e.g. Amer, E. S., et al. (1995) Pharmacol. Ther. 67, 155-186). Two potentially non-immunogenic candidate PRGs based on human nucleoside kinases have been developed; that is, a double mutant of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (see, e.g. Likar, Y., et al. (2010) J. Nucl. Med. 51, 1395-1403) and a truncated form of mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. (2007) J. Nucl. Med. 48, 819-826). These PRGs phosphorylate and trap the PRP 18F-FEAU. The sensitivity of the dCK-double mutant/18F-FEAU PRG-PRP system was comparable with that of HSV1-tk/18F-FEAU, whereas TK2/18F-FEAU had lower sensitivity. In non-human primates 18F-FEAU has a favorable biodistribution as a candidate PRP, with tracer accumulation in the liver, small intestine, kidneys, and urinary bladder (see, e.g. Dotti, G., et al. (2009) Mol. Imaging. 8, 230-237) but not in other organs and tissues. Human biodistribution data for this candidate PRP are not available.",
                                "The utility of a PRG-PRP system is dependent on its sensitivity (the ability to detect few therapeutic cells at various anatomical locations) and specificity (the probe should accumulate only in cells engineered to express the PRG). Another equally important parameter is the requirement that a PRG should be biologically inert. In other words its ectopic expression in therapeutic cells should not alter the metabolism or normal function of these cells. This requirement is especially important in the case of nucleoside kinase PRGs. Ectopic expression of a nucleoside kinase could perturb the normal regulation of nucleotide metabolism through excess phosphorylation of endogenous nucleosides. Such metabolic alterations can lead to imbalanced nucleotide pools and increased risk of genotoxicity (see, e.g. Kumar, D., et al. (2011) Nucleic Acids Res. 39, 1360-1371; Song, S., et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 43893-43896; Sargent, R. G., et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5546-5553; Kumar, D., et al. (2010) Nucleic Acids Res. 38, 3975-3983). In this context the dCK-double mutant has significantly higher activity than WT dCK toward endogenous nucleosides such as deoxycytidine and thymidine (see, e.g. Hazra, S., et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 1256-1263). Truncated TK2 also retains normal activity with natural substrates. Whether these new PRGs fulfill the critical requirement of being biologically inert remains to be determined.",
                                "Here, the development of a new PRG-PRP system that meets the specifications mentioned above is described. The biodistribution of L-18F-FMAU, the candidate PRP, was determined in mice and humans. Enzyme engineering was used to develop a mutant PRG enzyme that is orthogonal to the wild type enzyme regarding its ability to phosphorylate endogenous nucleosides. The resulting PRG-PRP system, TK2-N93D/L109F as PRG and L-18F-FMAU as PRP, should find utility in various preclinical and clinical therapeutic cell tracking applications. The approach used to develop this system should be generalizable to the identification and evaluation of other pairs of nucleoside analogs and nucleoside kinases for PET reporter gene imaging applications.",

In short, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) C41 harboring the modified pET14b vector (to include a SUMO tag between the hexahistidine sequence and TK2) were grown at 37\u00b0 C. until an optical density of \u02dc0.8 was reached. At that point the temperature was reduced to 18\u00b0 C.; the culture was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and left to shake overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use. Purification involved two steps. The first step used a metal affinity column (HisTRAP HP column, GE Healthcare); after elution of the His-SUMO-TK2 fusion protein, the SUMO protease was added. The cleaved protein was reapplied onto the nickel column to separate TK2 from the His-SUMO tag. The second step involved a gel filtration column (S200, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 3 mM DTT. Pure TK2 was pooled, concentrated to \u02dc10 mg/ml, separated into aliquots, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until use.",

Using a Cary UV spectrophotometer, measurements were made in triplicate at 37\u00b0 C. in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP. For data in which kobs is given, a single nucleoside concentration of 200 \u03bcM was used. For data in which both Km and kcat are given, the nucleoside concentration was varied between 15 and 500 \u03bcM. TK2 concentration in the cuvette was 400 nM. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot. Of note, in some previous reports, negative cooperativity was observed with thymidine but not with deoxycytidine (see, e.g. Barroso, J. F., et al. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 4886-4896; Wang, L., et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 6963-6968). When the data for WT TK2 was fitted using the Hill equation, one also saw the same magnitude of negative cooperativity as reported by others (n=\u02dc0.7) with thymidine and the analogs tested. However, the quality of the fit of the data is only marginally improved compared with that using the simple Michaelis-Menten equation. When the data of the TK2 mutants are fit using the Hill equation, a more complicated behavior is observed, with some conditions having a Hill coefficient below 1, some above 1, and some nearly one. Here again, the quality of the fit is not dramatically improved by adding the extra parameter of the Hill coefficient. Therefore, all of the kinetic data using the Michaelis-Menten equation without the Hill coefficient is presented.",

G., et al. (2008) Nat. Med. 14, 783-788; Shields, A. F. (2003) J. Nucl. Med. 44, 1432-1434; Sun, H., et al. (2005) J. Nucl. Med. 46, 292-296; Mangner, T. J., et al. (2003) Nucl. Med. Biol. 30, 215-224; Namavari, M., et al. (2011) Mol. Imaging. Biol. 13, 812-818). Nucleosides can adopt one of two enantiomeric configurations. Naturally occurring nucleosides are in the D configuration (see, e.g. de Leder Kremer, R. M., et al. (2004) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 59, 9-67). Recently there has been increasing interest in using nucleoside analogs with the non-natural L configuration as PET probes to image the activity of endogenous nucleoside kinases (see, e.g. Shu, C. J., et al. (2010) J. Nucl. Med. 51, 1092-1098; Nishii, R., et al. (2008) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 35, 990-998; Mukhopadhyay, U., et al. (2007) Appl. Radiat. Isot. 65, 941-946; Schwarzenberg, J., et al. (2011) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging. 38, 711-721). To date, L nucleosides have not been evaluated as PRPs. Determination of the potential value of L nucleosides as PRPs focused on L-18F-FMAU, the non-natural counterpart of D-18F-FMAU, one of the pyrimidine analogs that has been previously evaluated as a candidate PRP for the HSV1-tk PRG (see, e.g. Alauddin, M. M., et al. (2004) Mol. Imaging. 3, 76-84).",
                                "The biodistribution of L-18F-FMAU in mice was compared with that of 18F-FHBG, a well characterized and frequently used PRP (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, et al. (2001) J. Nucl. Med. 42, 1225-1234; Alauddin, M. M., et al. (1998) Nucl. Med. Biol. 25, 175-180; Alauddin, M. M., et al. (2001) J. Nucl. Med. 42, 1682-1690). To achieve optimal signal to noise ratios, PRPs should not accumulate in cells and tissues that do not express the corresponding PRG. For instance, the accumulation of the candidate PRP should be minimal or undetectable in all tissues, except in those involved in probe clearance from the body. C57/BL6 mice were scanned 3 h after administration of either L-18F-FMAU or 18F-FHBG (FIG. 26A). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the whole body microPET/CT images are shown in FIG. 1B. Quantification of the signals is presented in FIG. 33. Both L-18F-FMAU and 18F-FHBG had very low retention in the thoracic cavity. At the 3-h time point neither probe showed any accumulation in the liver. Accumulation in the gallbladder was 4 times higher for 18F-FHBG (7.45\u00b15.31% injected dose/g) than for L-18F-FMAU (1.68\u00b10.46% injected dose/g). Retention in the abdominal cavity was three times higher for 18F-FHBG than for L-18F-FMAU. This was likely due to higher biliary excretion of 18F-FHBG. Elevated 18F-FHBG accumulation was detected throughout the GI tract. In contrast, in mice injected with L-18F-FMAU signals were only detected in the lower GI tract. Thus, the biodistribution of L-18F-FMAU in mice was at least comparable with, if not better than that of 18F-FHBG.",

                                "L-FMAU has been shown to be a substrate for human TK2, a nucleoside kinase that due to its lack of enantiomeric specificity can phosphorylate both D and L nucleosides (see, e.g. Wang, J., et al. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 16993-16999). Ideally, modifications to the TK2 sequence should achieve two objectives; (i) increase sensitivity by reducing the negative feedback regulation of the enzyme and by increasing the phosphorylation rate of the L-FMAU PRP; (ii) reduce the activity of the PRG kinase for the endogenous substrates thymidine and deoxycytidine (to avoid competition between L-FMAU and endogenous nucleosides and potentially genotoxic perturbations of endogenous nucleotide pools).",
                                "The enzymatic activity of TK2 is regulated by thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) through negative feedback inhibition (see, e.g. Radivoyevitch, T., et al. (2011) Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids 30, 203-209). dTTP is produced by de novo synthesis and through the salvage of thymidine (via the cytosolic nucleoside kinase TK1). dTTP levels fluctuate throughout the cell cycle and are highest during the S phase, when they increase by as much as 2.5-20-fold compared with the G1 phase (see, e.g. Bianchi, V., et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16118-16124; Spyrou, G., et al. (1988) Mutat. Res. 200, 37-43). It is possible that fluctuations in dTTP levels during the cell cycle can reduce sensitivity and result in difficult to interpret changes in PET signals.",
                                "To reduce the susceptibility of TK2 to dTTP-mediated feedback inhibition, one took advantage of the 40% sequence identity between human TK2 and Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-DNK) (see, e.g. Eriksson, S., et al. (2002) Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 59, 1327-1346) and of the identification of a point mutation (N64D) in Dm-DNK that has been shown to reduce the effect of dTTP feedback inhibition (see, e.g. Welin, M., et al. (2005) FEBS J. 272, 3733-3742). The residue in TK2 corresponding to Asn-64 in D. melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase is Asn-93; the corresponding mutation in TK2 is N93D. To predict the effects of the N93D mutation on the structure of TK2, molecular modeling was used. One took advantage of the fact that dCK belongs to the same family of nucleoside kinases as TK2. The sequence identity and homology between dCK and TK2 are 35 and 50%, respectively. Based on previous works with dCK (see, e.g. Sabini, E., et al. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 513-519; Hazra, S., et al. (2011) Biochemistry 50, 2870-2880), a homology model of TK2 was obtained (FIG. 27A). It was hypothesized that, similar to dCK, TK2 can also adopt an open or a closed conformation. The enzyme is expected to be active in the closed conformation and inactive in the open conformation. In the model, when TK2 is in the closed conformation, Asn-93 is involved in hydrogen bonding with the glutamine at position 200 (E200, FIG. 27A). When the enzyme is in the open conformation, the residues are too far apart to interact. Thus, the N93D mutation would be expected to disfavor the closed conformation due to disruption of the interaction between Asn-93 and Glu-200 (FIG. 27A). dTTP should be able to exert its negative feedback inhibition on TK2 only if the enzyme is in the closed conformation. Because the N93D mutation favors the open conformation of the enzyme, it was predicted there would be a reduced probability for dTTP to bind and exert its inhibitory effect.",
                                "To test this hypothesis, kinase assays using L-FMAU and recombinant WT TK2 and TK2-N93D were performed in the presence of varying amounts of dTTP (FIG. 27B).WTTK2 activity decreased by 20% in the presence of 10 \u03bcM dTTP. In contrast, the activity of the N93D mutant decreased by only 4%. When the dTTP concentration was increased to 100 \u03bcM, the activity of WT TK2 decreased by 55%, whereas that of TK2-N93D decreased by less than 5%.",
                                "Cell-based uptake assays were then used to determine whether the decreased susceptibility to feedback inhibition conferred by the N93D mutation increases L-18F-FMAU uptake. As shown in FIG. 27C, a 1.5-fold increase was observed in L-18F-FMAU uptake by the N93D TK2 expressing L1210 cells relative to cells expressing similar levels of WT TK2.",
                                "To confirm that the increase in signal can also be detected in vivo, mice implanted with L1210 cells transduced with the WT TK2 and mutant TK2-N93D PRGs (FIG. 27D) were used. In vivo, L-18F-FMAU uptake by TK2-N93D PRG-expressing cells was nearly double of that observed with the WT TK2-expressing cells (FIGS. 27, D and E). Thus, by engineering a TK2 mutant that is less sensitive to feedback inhibition, one was able to improve the sensitivity of this candidate PRG for L-18F-FMAU.",

                                "For enzymatic PRGs, the higher the catalytic turnover (kcat) of the enzyme, the more the PRP can accumulate per unit time, leading to a higher PET signal. The kcat of mutated TK2 PRG for L analogs was determined compared with the endogenous substrate, D-dT. Relative to WT TK2, the N93D mutation reduced the kcat of the enzyme toward D-dT, L-dT, and L-FMAU (FIG. 28). However, the activity toward D-dT decreased by 77%, whereas that for L-dT and L-FMAU decreased only 48 and 32%, respectively. The kcat (L-FMAU)/kcat (D-dT) ratio for N93D nearly triples when compared with wild type. kcat/Km gives a measure of the substrate preference of an enzyme. Compared with WTTK2, the kcat/Km of N93D for L-FMAU increased by 77%, whereas the kcat/Km for D-dT decreased by 60%. Thus, the N93D mutation also achieved the goal of increasing the preference of the enzyme for L-FMAU over the natural substrate.",
                                "To identify additional mutations that may further improve the selectivity of the TK2 PRG for L analogs, high resolution structures of dCK in complex with L and D substrates (see, e.g. Sabini, E., et al. (2007) J. Med. Chem. 50, 3004-3014) were used to generate a homology model of TK2 with bound L-dT and D-dT (FIG. 29A). This model was then used to identify residues that, when mutated, would result in an enzyme with increased affinity for L-dT and decreased affinity for D-dT. This approach led to the identification of residue Leu-109 (FIG. 29A). According to the homology model, this residue interacts with the pyrimidine base. It is surmised that if Leu-109 were mutated to an amino acid with a bulkier side chain (e.g. phenylalanine), this would induce a steric clash with D nucleosides but less so with L nucleosides. In turn, this would lead to preferential binding of L versus D nucleosides. Contrary to one's expectations, the L109F mutation led to a decrease in the Km for both the D and L forms of dT (FIG. 28). Notably, the L109F mutation made the enzyme faster at phosphorylating all of the substrates tested, with a bigger effect on D-dT. Thus, for WT TK2, the kcat (L-FMAU)/kcat (D-dT) ratio is 3.7, whereas for TK2-L109F this is 2.4 (FIG. 28). Compared with WTTK2, the kcat/Km of L109F for L-FMAU increased 2.4 times, whereas the kcat/Km for D-dT increased 6.7 times. Thus, contrary to the prediction, the L109F mutation increased the preference of the enzyme for D-dT compared with L-FMAU. This demonstrates that although a homology model can be sufficient to identify \u201chot spots\u201d for mutagenesis (in this case, position 109), such a model may lack accuracy that can only be attained by an experimentally derived model. Nevertheless, although the L109F did not provide the desired increase in selectivity toward L nucleosides, it is important to note that the L109F mutation did increase the overall speed of the enzyme for all tested substrates.",
                                "Based on these observations, TK2-N93D/L109F was generated with the expectation that this double mutant will combine the enzymatic properties of the two single mutants. As shown in FIG. 28, this was indeed the case. Compared with TK2, the N93D/L109F double mutant had decreased kcat with D-dT (down 49%) but increased kcat with L-dT (up 54%) and L-FMAU (up 100%). The kcat (L-FMAU)/kcat (D-dT) ratio for the TK2-N93D/L109F mutant is 14.9, 4-fold higher than that for TK2 and nearly 40% higher than that for TK2-N93D. Importantly, the TK2-N93D/L109F mutant still retained resistance to inhibition by dTTP (FIG. 29B). In the presence of 10 \u03bcM dTTP, the kinase activity of recombinant TK2-N93D/L109F decreased by only 4%, whereas that of TK2-L109F decreased by 25%. At 100 \u03bcM dTTP, TK2-N93D/L109F decreased by only 11%, whereas TK2-L109F decreased by 56%.",

L-18F-FMAU uptake by TK2-N93D/L109F-expressing L1210 cells in the absence of D-dT was 1.5 times higher than that of TK2-N93D cells and nearly 4 times higher than that of TK2-L109F cells. In the presence of 5 \u03bcM D-dT, L-18F-FMAU uptake by TK2-N93D/L109F cells decreased by 47%, whereas that of TK2-N93D cells decreased by 75%. Although the L-18F-FMAU uptake of TK2-L109F in the presence of 5 \u03bcM D-dT decreased by 37%, it was still only 31% of the corresponding uptake for TK2-N93D/L109F.",

TK2-N93D/L109F has a kobs (dC) that is 62% that of TK2 (FIG. 34). These data indicate that TK2-N93D/L109F is orthogonal to wild type TK2, with increased activity toward the L-18F-FMAU PRP and decreased activity toward the endogenous nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine.",

Mean standard uptake values of the probes in different tissues for 18F-FHBG and L-18F-FMAU are listed in FIG. 4. For both probes, relatively high signals were observed in liver, kidneys, gall bladder, bladder, and the GI tract. L-18F-FMAU accumulation was also observed in the myocardium. At 2 h, more intense activity was observed in the liver after L-18F-FMAU injections than after 18F-FHBG administration. However, L-18F-FMAU activity was lower than that of 18F-FHBG within the GI tract region.",

As shown previously, the truncated protein is expected to localize in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondria (see, e.g. Ponomarev, V., et al. (2007) J. Nucl. Med. 48, 819-826). Rational design was then used to improve the sensitivity and selectivity of the TK2 PRG. This led to the development of TK2-N93D/L109F, a double mutant TK2 kinase characterized by reduced affinity for the natural substrates D-thymidine and D-deoxycytidine and increased affinity for L-FMAU. Studies in mice indicated that the TK2-N93D/L109F PRG has comparable sensitivity to that of the widely used HSV1-sr39tk/18F-FHBG system.

                                "In mice, L-18F-FMAU accumulates in the liver 1-h post injection (data not shown). The progression of the signal from the liver to the gallbladder and then to the GI indicates that L-18F-FMAU is excreted via a hepato-biliary mechanism, similar to that observed for 18F-FHBG (see, e.g. Yaghoubi, et al. (2001) J. Nucl. Med. 42, 1225-1234). However, the GI activity in L-18F-FMAU-injected mice is significantly less intense than that observed in mice injected with 18F-FHBG. The intense signal in the GI of mice injected with 18F-FHBG leads to spillover in other organs in the lower abdomen, limiting the utility of 18F-FHBG for cell tracking applications in mice if these cells localize in the abdominal cavity.",
                                "In addition to its human origin (which is expected to reduce immunogenicity compared with the viral PRGs), the TK2-N93D/L109F PRG also has the advantage of reduced activity toward the endogenous nucleosides, D-thymidine and D-deoxycytidine. PRGs are typically overexpressed in therapeutic cells. In this context, if the mutant PRG retains the ability to efficiently phosphorylate thymidine and/or deoxycytidine, then this may alter cellular metabolism due to overproduction of dTTP and/or dCTP. Such effects would be of particular concern in preclinical settings as serum levels of thymidine in mice and rats are 9-15 times higher than those in humans (see, e.g. Nottebrock, H., et al. (1977) Biochem. Pharmacol. 26, 2175-2179). Any changes in nucleotide metabolism and dNTP pools in therapeutic cells may have genotoxic consequences, especially when prolonged persistence in vivo of these cells is anticipated (for example in the case of stem cells). In contrast to previously reported PRG such as dCK-double mutant, TK2-N93D/L109F is less likely to perturb cellular nucleotide metabolism and genomic integrity due to the decreased activity of the double mutant enzyme toward natural substrates.",
                                "In contrast to mice, in humans L-18F-FMAU accumulates in the myocardium and liver. Regarding L-18F-FMAU accumu-mitochondria (see, e.g. Schaper, J., et al. (1985) Circ. Res. 56, 377-391). Moreover, the reported activity of the WT mitochondrial TK2 enzyme from human heart tissue is nearly 10 times higher than that of the enzyme from mouse heart tissue (see, e.g. Saada, A., et al. (2003) Mol. Genet. Metab. 79, 1-5; Wang, L., et al. (2000) Biochem. J. 351, 469-476). This difference may explain the observed differences in L-18F-FMAU myocardial accumulation between mice and humans. L-18F-FMAU is taken up by the liver of both mice and humans. However, L-18F-FMAU eventually clears the murine liver but is retained in the human liver. One reason for this difference may be that, similar to 18F-FLT (3\u2032-deoxy-3\u2032-18-fluorothymidine) (see, e.g. Shields, A. F., et al. (1998) Nat. Med. 4, 1334-1336), L-18F-FMAU may also undergo glucuronidation in human liver tissue. Glucuronidation of thymidine analogs is significantly less extensive in mice than in humans (see, e.g. Barthel, H., et al. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 3791-3798). Myocardial accumulation in humans may be reduced if L-18F-FMAU is modified to decrease its phosphorylation by WT TK2. Replacing the 5-methyl group with a larger substituent such as ethyl or propyl may achieve this objective.",

H., et al. J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 3644-3647). The synthesis of the 18F-fluoro analog 2 was carried out by a modification of the method reported by Mangner et al (see, e.g. Mangner, T. J., et al. Nuc. Med. Biol. 2003, 50, 215-224) for the corresponding D-isomer. No-carrier-added [18F]-fluoride ion was produced by 11 MeV proton bombardment of 98% enriched [18O]water in a tantalum target body using a RDS-112 cyclotron. The aqueous [18F]fluoride ion was passed through a small cartridge of BioRad MP-1 anion exchange resin (10 mg, bicarbonate form) to trap the [18F]fluoride ion. The [18F]fluoride ion was subsequently released from the cartridge with a solution of K2CO3 (1 mg in 0.4 mL of water) and mixed with a solution of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (10 mg) dissolved in water (0.04 mL) and acetonitrile (0.75 mL) mixture.",

To the dry residue, a solution of the triflate 1 (10 mg) in 0.7 mL of acetonitrile was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 165\u00b0 C. for 15 min in a sealed vessel. The solution was cooled to room temperature and passed through a Waters silica gel Sep-Pak. The product was eluted from the cartridge with 5 mL of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution was evaporated to dryness and 0.1 mL of a solution of 30% HBr in acetic acid was added followed by 0.4 mL of dichloroethane.",

Toluene (0.7 mL) was then added and the solution was evaporated at 110\u00b0 C. to give the bromo compound 3. A solution of the disilyl derivative of 5-methyluracil (4, 20 mg, Aldrich Chemical Company) was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloroethane and added to the bromo compound 3. The condensation reaction was carried out at 160\u00b0 C. in a sealed vessel for 30 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then passed through a Waters silica gel Sep-Pak.",

This solution was evaporated to dryness at 100\u00b0 C. and then treated with 0.5 mL of a solution of 0.5 M sodium methoxide in methanol. The reaction mixture was heated at 100\u00b0 C. for 5 min in a sealed vessel. The basic reaction mixture was neutralized with 0.25 mL of 1M HCl in water. This reaction mixture was diluted to a total volume of 3 mL with a mixture of 4% acetonitrile and 96% 50 mM ammonium acetate in water and injected into a semi-preparative HPLC column (Phenomenex Gemini C-18 column; 25 cm\u00d71 cm). The HPLC column was eluted with a solvent mixture of 4% acetonitrile and 96% 50 mM ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 5.0 mL/min. The effluent from the HPLC column was monitored with a 254 nm UV detector followed by a gamma radioactive detector. The chemically and radiochemically pure L-[18F] FMAU (6) that eluted off the column with a retention time of \u02dc24 min was collected and the solvents were evaporated in a rotary evaporator. One mL of ethanol was added to the residue and evaporated to remove the last traces of acetonitrile. This was followed by an addition of one mL sterile water and evaporation to remove the ethanol. The product was finally dissolved in 5 mL of sterile water and made isotonic with saline and sterilized by passing through a Millipore filter (0.22 \u03bcm) into a sterile multi-dose vial."
