    "title": "In Vivo Neutralization of \u03b1-Cobratoxin with High-Affinity Llama Single-Domain Antibodies (VHHs) and a VHH-Fc Antibody",
    "date": "2013-07-22",
    "abstract": "Small recombinant antibody fragments (e.g. scFvs and VHHs), which are highly tissue permeable, are being investigated for antivenom production as conventional antivenoms consisting of IgG or F(ab\u2019)2 antibody fragments do not effectively neutralize venom toxins located in deep tissues. However, antivenoms composed entirely of small antibody fragments may have poor therapeutic efficacy due to their short serum half-lives. To increase serum persistence and maintain tissue penetration, we prepared low and high molecular mass antivenom antibodies. Four llama VHHs were isolated from an immune VHH-displayed phage library and were shown to have high affinity, in the low nM range, for \u03b1-cobratoxin (\u03b1\u2013Cbtx), the most lethal component of Naja kaouthia venom. Subsequently, our highest affinity VHH (C2) was fused to a human Fc fragment to create a VHH2-Fc antibody that would offer prolonged serum persistence. After in planta (Nicotiana benthamiana) expression and purification, we show that our VHH2-Fc antibody retained high affinity binding to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx. Mouse \u03b1\u2013Cbtx challenge studies showed that our highest affinity VHHs (C2 and C20) and the VHH2-Fc antibody effectively neutralized lethality induced by \u03b1\u2013Cbtx at an antibody:toxin molar ratio as low as ca. 0.75\u00d7:1. Further research towards the development of an antivenom therapeutic involving these anti-\u03b1-Cbtx VHHs and VHH2-Fc antibody molecules should involve testing them as a combination, to determine whether they maintain tissue penetration capability and low immunogenicity, and whether they exhibit improved serum persistence and therapeutic efficacy.",

                "Snake bite envenomation is a serious global public health problem especially in tropical and subtropical countries where poisonous snakes are abundant and agriculture activities are high [1]. It is estimated that over 5 million snake bite cases occur worldwide each year, of which 2.7 million cause envenomation, with about 125,000 of these resulting in death [2]. Although many people survive envenomation, a large number of victims develop severe local tissue damage that may lead to permanent physical disability [3]. Since most snakebite victims are young male agricultural workers with families, their disability has serious social and economical impacts, especially in developing countries [1], [3].",
                "Since their first development and use in the late 1800s by Calmette, conventional antivenoms remain the only specific treatments for envenomation. Most antivenoms are composed of either whole IgGs (150 kDa), F(ab\u2032)2 antibody fragments (100 kDa) or, in some cases, Fab antibody fragments (50 kDa) from horses or sheep immunized with one (monospecific) or a mixture (polyspecific) of venoms [4]. Intravenous administration of antivenom is generally efficacious in treating systemic envenomation [3]; however, because of the rapid development of localized pathologies and the inability of antivenom antibodies to penetrate affected tissues, conventional antivenoms are generally ineffective in treating local effects on tissues near the snake bite, often resulting in permanent physical disability [3], [4], [5]. Furthermore, conventional antivenoms often elicit life-threatening adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis or serum sickness in patients [4].",
                "Because of their unique immune system, there has been a growing interest in recent years to assess the use of camelids (camels, llamas, alpacas) for antivenom production [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Aside from conventional IgGs, camelids have evolved a unique class of IgG naturally devoid of light chains called heavy-chain antibodies (HCAbs) [14]. The antigen binding sites of these HCAbs are composed of a single variable domain (called VHH), and are the smallest natural antigen binding domain (\u223c15 kDa). HCAbs, and their VHHs, show particular promise for antivenom development because they can act as potent enzyme inhibitors by targeting cryptic enzyme clefts that are often poorly antigenic to mammalian immune systems that develop only conventional IgGs [15], [16]. Recent studies have shown that both camels and llamas immunized with snake venom generate antisera titres comparable to those of horses that are used for antivenom preparations [8], [17]. Encouraging results further show that camelid antibodies (unfractionated conventional IgGs and HCAbs) effectively neutralize the lethality and/or a variety of pathologies induced by snake venoms from Bothrops mattogrossensis (Mato Grosso lancehead) [6]; Echis ocellathus (saw-scaled viper) [8], [18]; and Bitis arietans (the puff adder) [18]. Further, scorpion (Androctonus australis hector) venom toxins have been shown to be potently neutralized by specific camelid IgGs, HCAbs, and by monovalent or bivalent VHHs [9], [10], [11], [13]. While elapid (e.g. cobra) venoms are generally considered poorly antigenic [19], one recent study showed potent camel antisera titres in response to Naja nigricollis (spitting cobra) immunization [17]. Unfortunately, these camelid IgGs were not able to neutralize the lethal-effects of N. nigricollis envenomation in an in vivo mouse study [18]. This last report indicates that more research needs to be done to increase our understanding of how to treat snake envenomation, particularly by elapids, using antibody-based products.",
                "Since conventional antivenom antibodies poorly neutralize venom toxins located in deep tissues, smaller recombinant antibody fragments (e.g. scFvs, VHHs), which are highly tissue permeable, have been explored in recent years for use in antivenom preparations [9], [10], [11], [12], [20], [21], [22], [23]. In fact, camelid VHHs have several attractive properties that may make them better therapeutic reagents for the treatment of snake envenomation: they are relatively non-immunogenic, soluble, stable (pH and heat), highly tissue penetrable and are easy to genetically manipulate for creation of multivalent/multifunctional formats [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Nevertheless, antivenoms composed entirely of small antibody fragments would likely have limited therapeutic efficacy because these fragments are cleared from the body rapidly [30], [31]. Therefore, it has been suggested in recent years that antivenoms prepared with a mixture of high molecular mass antibodies (IgG; F(ab\u2019)2) and low molecular mass antibody fragments (Fab; scFv; VHH) may offer better treatment for envenomation [8], [12], [30], [32]. This type of antivenom would not only allow the rapid neutralization of toxins by small fragments in tissue compartments, but also ensure that significant concentrations of antibodies (IgG, F(ab\u2019)2) remain in circulation long enough to neutralize toxins there later in the course of envenomation.",
                "To our knowledge, only two na\u00efve recombinant antibody libraries have previously been panned against \u03b1-cobratoxin (\u03b1\u2013Cbtx), the most potent \u03b1\u2013neurotoxin from the venom of N. kaouthia (common names: monocellate cobra, Thai cobra). The first report was from our group, in which the isolation of three na\u00efve llama VHHs with moderate affinities, in the low \u00b5M (2\u20133 \u00b5M) range, to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx was described [12]; the affinities of these were deemed too low for therapeutic efficacy and therefore were not used for in vivo testing. More recently, Kulkeaw et al. [21] isolated seven na\u00efve human scFv (HuScFv) clones to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (affinities not reported). Their best neutralizing HuScFv (clone #24), administered at 10\u00d7 Ab:toxin (w/w) (2.65 \u00b5g HuScFv:0.265 \u00b5g \u03b1\u2013Cbtx), was only able to protect 33% of mice from \u03b1\u2013Cbtx-induced lethality (Table 8 of [21]). Full protection against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx was not attained even when this clone was administered at a much higher dose (83.9 \u00b5g HuScFv: 0.265 \u00b5g \u03b1\u2013Cbtx). In this study, we set out to isolate higher affinity antibody fragments with more potent neutralizing capacity against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx, through construction of a VHH library from a llama immunized with crude N. kaouthia venom. We report the isolation of high affinity VHHs (low nM range) that offer full protection (100% mice survival) against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx. To increase the half-life of our VHHs, we also report the fusion of our highest affinity VHH (C2) with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 to create a VHH2-Fc antibody (Mr \u223c80 kDa). After in planta expression and purification, we show that our VHH2-Fc antibody retained high affinity binding to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx and also has potent in vivo neutralizing capacity against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx."

                        "Cobra venoms, and especially that of N. kaouthia, are believed to be weakly immunogenic because of the low molecular weight of their neurotoxins [19], [33], [34]. Therefore, we used, with our own modifications, a \u2018low dose, low volume, multi-site\u2019 venom-immunization protocol that has been shown to be effective at raising high IgG titres against cobra venoms in horses [33] and recently, in camels [17]. The llama was immunized with crude N. kaouthia venom and details regarding the amount, timing and adjuvants used are described in Table 1. The immunogen cocktail [0.5 mL; in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4] was emulsified in an equal volume of TiterMax\u2122 Classic adjuvant (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) for the first three immunizations, and with an equal volume of incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma) for subsequent immunizations. Each administration occurred subcutaneously at four different locations (0.25 mL/site) (i.e., two sites near the neck and two in the hind quarters). Llama blood was withdrawn from the jugular vein one week after immunizations 2 through 6 (Table 1). After blood coagulation, serum was obtained by centrifuging at 2,700\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until required.

The most efficacious VHHs were C2 and C20 which neutralized \u03b1\u2013Cbtx at 0.75\u00d7 and 1.0\u00d7 MR (molar ratio) of VHH:toxin, respectively. While C19 and C43 offered some neutralizing activity, 100% protection could not be attained with the amount of purified protein available at the time. The VHH2-Fc antibody, at a 0.78\u00d7 MR, showed complete neutralization of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx with 100% survival (Fig. 7).Since C2 was the most efficacious VHH, it was chosen for further testing. For a mock envenomation test, C2 administered 15 or 30 minutes post-toxin injection provided 100% (6/6) and 83% (5/6) survival, respectively (Fig. 7). In addition, the neutralizing capacity of C2 was evaluated by challenging mice with increased dosage of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx and treating with various C2:toxin molar ratio (Table 5). The data show that the neutralizing capacity of C2 at 1, 2 and 4\u00d7 the LD100 \u03b1\u2013Cbtx is 0.75, 1 and 2\u00d7 on a molar basis, respectively."

                "Since its first use in the late 1800s by Calmette, passive immunotherapy using conventional antivenoms remains the only specific treatment for snake bite envenomation [4]. Although conventional antivenoms help increase survival rate, there are many problems associated with their use including i) their poor neutralization of toxins in deep tissues, ii) the adverse reactions they elicit (anaphylaxis, serum sickness), and iii) their limited supply [4]. In fact, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. [3] have categorized snake bite envenomation as a major neglected disease of the 21st century. There is a need for more efficacious, safer and widely distributed therapeutics for snake envenomation.",
                "In recent years, members of the camelidae (camels, llamas, alpacas) have been suggested for antivenom production. Similar to horses, camelids are docile and are able to yield large volumes of serum, and camel species are better suited than horses to live in hot, tropical and desert areas where snakes are most prevalent. In addition, camelid antibodies may represent a safer alternative to conventional equine and ovine antivenom antibodies because they are less immunogenic and therefore less likely to elicit adverse effects in patients [7], [29]. Further, camelid-derived single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) possess several attractive physico-chemical properties that may make them better therapeutic reagents for the treatment of envenomation. Due to their low molecular mass (\u223c15 kDa), VHHs penetrate tissue compartments more readily than conventional antibody fragments [25], [27], [50] and, therefore, may protect victims from the tissue-damaging effects of venom toxins. In addition, VHHs often have a longer CDR-3 loop that protrudes from the paratope allowing it to target cryptic enzyme clefts that are often nonreactive to conventional VHs [15], [16]. Finally, VHHs have enhanced stability and solubility and are easily expressed and purified from E. coli or yeast expression systems, which may make production cheaper and more efficient.",
                "We previously isolated three VHHs from a na\u00efve llama phage-display VHH library against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx, the most potent \u03b1\u2013neurotoxin from the venom of N. kaouthia [12]. Since their affinities were too low for therapeutic use (2\u20133 \u00b5M), we set out, in this study, to isolate higher affinity single-domains from a hyperimmune library. We immunized a llama with crude N. kaouthia venom instead of purified \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (see immunization schedule Table 1). Our immunization scheme was inspired by a \u201clow dose, low volume, multi-site immunization\u201d protocol described by Chotwiwatthanakun et al. (2001) that showed potent horse IgG titres for antivenom production. However, we modified this protocol in terms of adjuvant used, time interval between injections, total number of injection sites, and injection volumes. Our llama, which was immunized with up to 2 mg of crude N. kaouthia, did not suffer from any visible signs cobra envenomation or local reaction at the injection sites. After receiving the first boost (post-immune Day 21; total of 2 injections), the llama generated a rapid humoral response to N. kaouthia venom and more specifically to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (Fig. 2A). Others have also observed a rapid rise in IgG titres following venom-immunzation in camelids and horses [8], [17], [33], [34]. Thereafter, we observed an abrupt decrease in the humoral response after the second boost (Day 42, total of 3 injections). In subsequent injections, we decided to replace the adjuvant (TiterMax\u2122) with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), and consequently observed the humoral response to increase again (Fig. 2). One report has shown that \u03b1\u2013Cbtx elicits its highest titres rapidly in the immunization schedule and that after reaching a plateau, titres slowly decrease even after continued injections [34]. Our llama\u2019s final (last bleed collected) antiserum titre to N. kaouthia was 3.0\u00d7105 (Fig. S1) and is very comparable to that observed by Cook et al. [17] in camels immunized with N. nigricollis venom.",
                "After detecting a llama HCAb immune response against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (Fig. 2B), we constructed a large phage-displayed VHH library of 5.0\u00d7109 clones with 84% containing a VHH coding sequence. Sequence analysis revealed that the 3rd round of panning generated several unique VHH sequences. Based on CDR homology and CDR3 length, the VHH clones were grouped into either Cluster I or Cluster II (Fig. 4). Binders clustered together share high CDR sequence identity; however, little CDR homology is shared between these two clusters. Furthermore, the \u03b1\u2013Cbtx binders from Cluster I have a CDR3 length of 17 amino acid residues while those from Cluster II have 14 residues.",
                "Several differences were also noted when these VHHs were aligned (alignment not shown) against those we previously isolated from a na\u00efve library [12]. The na\u00efve binders all belong to VHH subfamily 1 while the immune ones belong to VHH subfamily 2 [49]. As expected, the immune VHHs share little CDR homology with the na\u00efve ones, since they had the opportunity to go through natural affinity maturation. For instance, immune VHHs have a shorter (14 or 17 residues) CDR3 region than the na\u00efve ones (18 or 19 residues). This result is consistent with the literature since VHH subfamily 2 have on average a shorter CDR3 region than other subfamilies [49]. We chose two clones from Cluster I (C19 and C20) and two clones from Cluster II (C2 and C43) for further characterization. The clones were expressed in 1 L E. coli cultures (yields: 12\u201318 mg L\u22121) and purified from the periplasmic fractions using IMAC.",
                "Kinetic analysis by SPR revealed that high affinity \u03b1\u2013Cbtx binders were isolated from the immune library (Table 4, Fig. 6). In particular, C2 had the strongest affinity for \u03b1\u2013Cbtx with KD value of 0.4 nM. Despite having identical CDR2 and CDR3, C43 had 60-fold less affinity (KD\u200a=\u200a24 nM) than C2 to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (Table 4). It is in the CDR1 that they differ the most (5/10; 50% identity) with some FR1 substitutions as well. The differences in binding affinities to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx among the clones suggest that the CDR1 is instrumental in binding \u03b1\u2013Cbtx, at least for these two VHHs. Accordingly, Vu et al. [29] have previously suggested that, in contrast to human and mice VHs, amino acid residues from the CDR1 of camelid VHHs play a critical role in antigen-binding. C19 and C20 also had strong affinities to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx with KD values of 25 nM and 1 nM, respectively. Furthermore, our immune \u03b1\u2013Cbtx VHH binders had \u223c1000-fold higher affinity compared to those we previously isolated from a na\u00efve VHH library (2\u20133 \u00b5M) [12]. Although immune libraries are cumbersome and time-consuming to construct, our result show that it was necessary to construct an immune library to isolate high affinity binders against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx that offer full in vivo protection.",
                "When tested in an in vivo mouse challenge, all of our isolated VHHs showed neutralizing activity against lethal doses of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (Fig. 7). There was an inverse correlation between the neutralizing ability of each VHH and its KD, i.e., the highest affinity binder C2 (KD\u200a=\u200a0.4 nM) was able to neutralize the toxin at the lowest dose of 0.75\u00d7 MR antibody:toxin. In terms of weight/weight (w/w), 6.38 \u00b5g of VHH C2 completely neutralized 4 \u00b5g of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx, thus representing 1.6\u00d7 w/w. In comparison, a previous report showed that their most efficacious human na\u00efve scFv (HuScfv clone #24) against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx was only able to protect 33% of mice when administered at 10\u00d7 w/w (2.65 \u00b5g HuScFv/0.265 \u00b5g \u03b1\u2013Cbtx), and full protection was not attained even when administered at a much higher dose (83.9 \u00b5g HuScFv/0.265 \u00b5g \u03b1\u2013Cbtx) with 83% survival for 6 hours [21]. However, we did observe a discrepancy between our lethal dose (LD100 of 4 \u00b5g, this study) and theirs (LD100 of 0.265 \u00b5g, [21]). Our lethal dose is in accordance with the toxicity reported by Karlsson and Eaker [48] and with the product information sheet supplied with our purchased \u03b1\u2013Cbtx (LD100\u200a=\u200a100 \u00b5g kg\u22121).",
                "Despite their improved tissue permeability, the clinical use of VHHs as the only reagent in antivenom preparations would likely be limited by their rapid clearance from the body. In fact, if VHHs would likely be eliminated from the body before venom toxins reached circulation, signs of recurrence of evenomation after initial successful therapy may arise as has been observed with treatment with Fab antivenoms [4]. Since several recent reports have suggested that the ideal antivenom should contain a combination of low and high molecular weight antibody reagents [8], [12], [30], [32], we created a VHH-Fc antibody by fusing our highest affinity \u03b1\u2013Cbtx VHH C2 with the CH2 and CH3 domains of a human IgG1 (VHH2-Fc antibody; Mr \u223c80 kDa). Because of its Fc region and higher molecular weight, this antibody should offer prolonged serum persistence.",
                "Our engineered VHH2-Fc antibody construct was successfully expressed in planta with an average yield of 129.50 mg kg\u22121 of fresh leaf tissue. Unfortunately, immunoblotting and N-terminal sequencing revealed that in addition to the correct VHH2-Fc antibody there was also a product consisting of the Fc region only. Since the ELISA used to quantitate the expression level detected all material with an Fc region, the average yield is likely closer to 50 mg kg\u22121 for the intact VHH2-Fc antibody, based on the densitometry results. SPR analysis showed that our plant produced VHH2-Fc antibody retains high affinity binding to \u03b1\u2013Cbtx with a dissociation rate constant of 5.0\u00d710\u22125 s\u22121. Our VHH2-Fc antibody also has potent in vivo neutralizing capacity against \u03b1\u2013Cbtx comparable to the parent VHH C2 antibody.",
                "Since the llama was immunized with crude N. kaouthia venom, the VHH library could also be panned against other components of the N. kaouthia venom. It would also be particularly valuable to select VHHs against locally acting toxins including phospholipases A2 and metalloproteinases since these cause much of the tissue damage associated with Thai cobra snake bites [51]. Furthermore, methodologies should be developed to simultaneously select VHHs against crude venom, while ensuring that all venom components are represented and neutralized. Mixtures of VHH C2 with current antivenom derived from horse should also be tested to determine if efficacy of the antivenom can be improved in terms of reducing its required dose. However, to reduce the tissue damage of whole venom at the site of a snake bite, VHHs that bind components of the venom (discussed above) must also be produced before a solely VHH-based venom may prove effective.",
                "In summary, we isolated high affinity llama single domain antibody fragments (VHHs) against \u03b1-Cbtx from an immune library. The highest affinity binders, C2 and C20, were able to completely neutralize the lethal effects of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx below 1x antibody:toxin molar ratios. For therapeutic efficacy, our results show that monomers should have a KD of ca. 1 nM or better, thus requiring the creation of an immune library. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our plant-expressed VHH2-Fc antibody retained high affinity and also offered full protection to mice against the lethal effects of \u03b1\u2013Cbtx. Further research towards the development of an antivenom therapeutic involving these anti-\u03b1-Cbtx VHHs and VHH2-Fc antibody molecules should involve testing them as a combination, to determine whether they maintain tissue penetration capability and low immunogenicity, and whether they exhibit improved serum persistence and therapeutic efficacy."
