    "title": "Propylene Polymerization Performance with Ziegler-Natta Catalysts Combined with U-Donor and T01 Donor as External Donor",
    "date": "2022-08-05",
    "abstract": "In propylene (C3) polymerization with Ziegler-Natta catalyst, not only internal donor but also external donor is very important to make isotactic polypropylene (PP) with higher yield. Most propylene-based polymers have been commercially produced with Ziegler-Natta catalysts combined with dialkyl-dialkoxy silane compounds (R2Si(OR)2) such as C-donor, P-donor, and D-donor as external donors. In this paper, we will introduce the propylene polymerization performance with aminosilane compounds, i.e., diethylamino triethoxy silane (U-donor) and bis(ethylamino) di-cyclopentyl silane (T01 donor), as external donor in Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst. The polymerization screening experiments were conducted using some triethoxyalkylsilanes compounds (1\u20137) and performances were compared with U-donor. The polymerization results of the binary donor system show improvement in stereoregularity. These aminosilane compounds exhibit high hydrogen response in propylene polymerization and high copolymerization performance of propylene (C3) and ethylene (C2) in ICP production compared with dialkyl-dialkoxy silane compounds. While using methanol as an additive along with external electron donor, as a serendipitous, the copolymerization activity, block ratio, EPR (ethylene-propylene rubber) content improve significantly for U-donor as compared with T01 donor and C-donor.",

                "Polypropylene (PP) is widely used in many applications such as injection molding, film, non-woven fabric, and so on [1,2]. In industrial production, most of the PP is produced with Ziegler-Natta catalyst (ZN catalyst), with MgCl 2 support, TiCl 4 as active sites, and Lewis base compound (typically named internal electron donor, ID) [3][4][5][6][7][8][9], combined with alkyl compound and another class of Lewis base compound (named external electron donor, ED) [10].",
                "The main roles of the internal and external donors in propylene (C3) polymerization are improvement of catalyst activity and formation of isospecific active species [7,8]. The internal donor is added during catalyst preparation and directly supported on MgCl 2 surface, which suggested that internal donor could control the TiCl 4 distribution and form highly isospecific sites on MgCl 2 surface [7,8].",
                "Many ZN catalysts used in industry contain phthalate compounds as internal donors [2,11]. In addition to phthalates, diether [12], succinic acid esters [13], diol diesters [14,15], etc., are used, and catalysts using these internal donors are spreading worldwide due to the influence of REACH regulation in Europe [2].",
                "The polymerization performance of the ZN catalyst varies depending on the choice of internal donor, but is also affected by the external donor to be combined. In general, dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane (DCPDMSi; DCP; D-donor), diisopropyl dimethoxy silane (DIPDMSi; DIP; P-donor), and cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane (CMDMSi; CM; C-donor) have been used in both of academic and industrial fields so far and exhibit different isospecificity and chain transfer reactivity with hydrogen. Accordingly, the combination of internal and external donors is very important to obtain polypropylene showing the desired physical properties [16][17][18].",
                "On the other hand, the performance improvement of electric injection molding machines has a great impact on the performance of the catalyst. In other words, innovation of thin wall injection molded technology was born by combination of this molding machine with high flow and high crystalline PP, and the products are utilized for food packaging. Therefore, there is a demand for a catalyst system of high H 2 response (chain transfer reaction under low H 2 concentration) which gives high flow PP. Unfortunately, the current external donors mentioned before cannot meet this requirement.",
                "From such a point of view, we propose two kinds of amino silane compound as external donor; diethylamino tri-ethoxy silane (U-donor) [19][20][21], and bis(ethylamino) di cyclopentyl silane (T01 donor) [22,23] commercial product of Toho Titanium Co., Ltd. These aminosilane compounds exhibit higher H 2 response than those of dialkoxy silane compounds in propylene polymerization. Moreover, we found that these aminosilane compounds show unique performance in the production of impact copolymer (ICP), which is block copolymerization of polypropylene and ethylene-propylene copolymer.",
                "In this paper, we describe the fundamental polymerization performance with U-donor and T01 donor in combination with phthalate-based ZN catalyst. The two commercial products of alkoxy aminosilane compounds (U-donor and T01 donor) were used as external electron donor (ED) for propylene polymerization (Scheme 1). These external electron donors (U-donor and T01 donor) were used for propylene homo polymerization (homo-PP) and impact copolymerization (ICP-PP). The results were compared with other external electron donors such as C-donor and D-donor, which are most commonly industrially used external electron donors.

On the other hand, with the introduction of methanol as an additive along with U-donor, as a serendipitous, the copolymerization activity, block ratio, and EPR content improve significantly (run 21). This could be due to the effect of reaction between AlEt 3 (TEAL) with methanol along with U-donor. For example, the triethylaluminum (TEAL) reacts with methanol and produces AlEt 2 (OMe) (Al/MeOH = 0.31). The catalyst active species of U-donor is deactivated by AlEt 3 . At the same time, addition of methanol prevented the deactivation of the active species and as a result copolymerization activity improved for U-donor. For T01 donor, very high ICP performance was showed as compared with U-and C-donors, however, with addition of methanol the ICP performance decreased significantly (run 22 and 23). The poor ICP performance for T01 donor with methanol as an additive could be due to the steric hindrance between AlEt 2 (OMe) (Al/MeOH = 0.31) and T01 donor. However, for C-donor no change in polymerization performances (run 24 and 25) was observed under identical polymerization conditions using methanol as an additive."

A portion of the polymer was sampled for MFR measurement under nitrogen. A monomer supply line and the like were connected again to the autoclave, and ethylene, propylene, and hydrogen were added at an C 2 H 4 /C 3 H 6 /H 2 molar ratio of 1.7/2.3/0.086 to the reactor with a stirrer, which was then warmed to 70 \u2022 C.

The U-donor-based PP polymers show high hydrogen response with high stereoregularity as compared with C-donor, which are an industrially important parameter for PP production. However, PP-polymer yield is lower for U-donor than using C-donor. The external electron donor screening experiments were carried out using various triethoxyalkylsilane compounds (1-7) against U-donor. The catalyst activity and hydrogen response including stereoregularity (pentad isotacticity, mmmm) were high for U-donor-based PP-polymers as compared with triethoxyalkylsilane compounds (1-7).",
                "The polymerization screening experiments were carried out using binary donors (U + D) keeping MFR around 35 g/10 min. The target MFR (~35 g/10 min) could be achieved with very low hydrogen using U-donor (run 15). However, the catalyst activity was low as compared with using D-donor with the same stereoregularity (run16). In addition, in the binary donor system (combination of U and D) the catalyst activity and stereoregularity improve significantly (run 14) with moderate molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn = 5.9)."
