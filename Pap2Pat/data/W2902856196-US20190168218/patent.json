The environment may resemble naturally occurring circumstances. As such a cell can likewise be studied under application of at least one of numerous signals that might be present in their naturally occurring surrounding microenvironment.",

The capability of the present device of having integrated electrical microstructures 29,90 allows to have cell micro-environments where real-time monitoring and stimulating of different types of cells is possible; e.g. electrical stimulation of heart cells or neurons, reading of neuron and heart cells electrical activity, trans-endothelial electrical resistance measurements in brain-blood barrier models, among other applications.",
                        "The present device also allows the control over the mechanical and topographical signals supplied to a cell microenvironment through its configurable polymeric layers, e.g. patterned surface 27, to improve adhesion and alignment of heart cells, flexible membrane layers 20a,b to apply stress on cultured cells locally, microporous surface 28 to allow and study migration of immune cells in lung and/or skin models, and study of the interface between two different cell cultures.

The wafer may then be diced (cut) and mounted on an assembly including e.g. a well 35 for cell culturing, a microfluidic inlet 32, a pneumatic inlet to stretch the membrane 36 and an electrical output to read the output of the electrodes, and the sensors embedded in the chip 38.
