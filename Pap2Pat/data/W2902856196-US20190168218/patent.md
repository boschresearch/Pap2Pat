# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is in the field of microfluidic devices produced with silicon technology wherein at least one 3D microenvironment is present, a method of producing said device using silicon based technology, and a use of said device in various applications, typically a biological cell experiment, such as a cell or organ-on-a-chip experiment, and lab-on-a-chip experiment, and use of the device as a micro-reactor.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A microfluidic device relate to a set of technologies with an aim to manipulate at least one small fluid (liquid or gas) volume within microsystems produced by human beings. In the device a cell culture or an individual cell or the like may be present. An experiment on said cell culture refers to the maintenance and growth of cells in a well-controlled environment. The environment may resemble naturally occurring circumstances. As such a cell can likewise be studied under application of at least one of numerous signals that might be present in their naturally occurring surrounding microenvironment.

A microfluidic cell culture may attempt to manipulate cells, such as by culturing, maintaining, and growing, and qualitatively and quantitatively experimenting and analyzing cells in microfluidic volumes. Such may relate to an attempt to understand a cell culture, such as a stem cell culture, non-dividing or slowly dividing cells, e.g. in terms of an interaction between cell culture parameters and the micro environmental conditions created by microfluidic devices. It is considered that dimensions of the microfluidics, such as chamber and channels, are well suited to the physical scale of the biological cells and other applications.

In general it is considered that microfluidics provide a good degree control over e.g. cell culture conditions. Typically a movement of fluids in the microfluidics is considered to be laminar; a fluid volume is typically in the order of 10−6-10−12 l; fluid flow may be controlled precisely in terms of volume and timing, such as by providing an in-chip valve; also precise chemical and physical control of the microenvironment is possible; a production of a multitude of individually controllable cell culture chambers on a single device is considered, albeit typical prior art technologies rely on manual procedures which are considered to be insufficiently controlled.

Some prior art documents recite microfluidic devices.

WO2016/049363 A1, WO2016/049365 A1, WO2016/010861 A1, WO2016/004394 A1, and U.S. Ser. No. 15/2,955,534 A1 recite relatively simple organ on chip devices, which cannot include any complex sensing/stimulation elements; hence these device are not unsuited for most applications.

In “Reconstituting organ-level lung functions on a chip.” Science 328.5986 (2010): 1662-1668, Kim, Hyun Jung, et al. in “Human gut-on-a-chip inhabited by microbial flora that experiences intestinal peristalsis-like motions and flow.” Lab on a Chip 12.12 (2012): 2165-2174, Huh, Dongeun, et al. in “Microfabrication of human organs-on-chips.” Nature protocols 8.11 (2013): 2135-2157, and WO2015/138034 A1 present devices that have a limited production yield, limited throughput and limited functionality and do not seem to relate to more than a specific microfluidic device; the devices are considered to provide some basic functionality but are not ready in technological terms for further application.

Recently one of the present inventors published an article (Gaio et al., “Cytostretch, an Organ-on-Chip Platform”, Micromachines, Vol. 7, Jul. 14, 2016, 120 (p. 1-14). The Cytostretch device does not relate to a microfluidic channel. It is a foil that does not have any channel. For fabrication some steps overlap with the present method, but the above patent WO2015/138034 A1 and this paper do not relate to e.g. a channel in a thin layer.

The present invention relates to a device and a method of producing said device which overcomes one or more of the above or further disadvantages, without jeopardizing functionality and advantages.

The term “fluidics” may relate to a gas, a liquid; and combinations thereof; a “microfluidic” is considered to be fluid under boundary conditions of the device.

The set-up composed by the polymer layers, typically forming a membrane or foil, the micro-channels, the micro-chambers, and first micro-chamber (also referred to as “macro-chamber”) can be optically monitored off-line with a microscope and/or a camera e.g. placed on a backside/front-side of the device. The macro-chamber can have dimensions in the order of 100*100 μm2 to 10*10 mm2. The set-up can be monitored on-line by means of micro-electrode array and/or micro-fabricated sensors (such as flow/temperature/pH sensor) provided in the micro-environment and or in the macro-chambers. The set-up can be also altered/stimulated by means of liquid flow flowing through the micro-chamber/channels and the macro-chamber; likewise by gas flow flowing through the micro-chamber/channel and the macro-chamber; by pressure differences applied in the micro-chambers, in the micro-channels and on the backside and the front side of the membrane (see e.g. FIG. 11); by electrical stimulation provided by means of microelectrode arrays; by optical stimulation provided with optical systems placed on the backside/front-side of the device; by chemical stimulation provided by means of liquid flow or liquid reservoir placed in the membrane; and other micro-fabricated actuators placed inside the micro-channel/chambers; and combinations thereof, hence the device is considered to be versatile.

The presented microchip is typically fabricated on a Silicon substrate with standard IC and MEMS technologies. The silicon bulk and the chosen fabrication process provide advantages such as: use of standard cleanroom compatible micro-fabrication processes to achieve wafer-scale fabrication that can be scaled up to volume production by eliminating manual assembly and sample handling. This enables high yield and throughput, thus, low cost volume production. The device can be equipped with additional modules embedded on the backside and/or front-side of the membrane and/or in the microenvironment composed by the micro-channels/chambers. By adding or removing one or more modules during fabrication, it is possible to adapt the device to meet different demands.

The present device may find numerous applications in various Organ-on-Chips, Lab-on-Chips, microfluidics, and microreactors. The capability of the present device of having integrated electrical microstructures 29,90 allows to have cell micro-environments where real-time monitoring and stimulating of different types of cells is possible; e.g. electrical stimulation of heart cells or neurons, reading of neuron and heart cells electrical activity, trans-endothelial electrical resistance measurements in brain-blood barrier models, among other applications.

The wafer may then be diced (cut) and mounted on an assembly including e.g. a well 35 for cell culturing, a microfluidic inlet 32, a pneumatic inlet to stretch the membrane 36 and an electrical output to read the output of the electrodes, and the sensors embedded in the chip 38. The present method therewith provides a way of producing the present device.
