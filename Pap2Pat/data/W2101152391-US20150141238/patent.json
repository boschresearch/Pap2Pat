                        "The present invention is generally directed toward nanocatalysts and methods of using such catalysts to synthesize aromatic hydrocarbon compounds from carbon dioxide and hydrogen mixtures under relatively mild reaction conditions. Particularly, the catalyst comprises an Fe/Fe3O4 nanocatalyst that may be supported on a non-reactive support material such as a zeolite or alumina. The aromatic hydrocarbon compounds produced are suitable for direct usage as fuel without need for further refining.",
                        "2. Description of the Prior Art",
                        "The diminishing fossil fuel reserves and ever-increasing CO2 emissions have created great concern amongst the scientific community. Since the industrial revolution, a significant increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been witnessed due to the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels, consequently, leading to global warming and drastic climate changes. As a result, the quest for renewable and cleaner energy sources to meet the fast population and economic growth is more urgent than ever before. Being the most abundant carbon source in earth's atmosphere, CO2 can be used as a cheap and non-toxic C1 building block in many chemical processes. Hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol and dimethylether (DME), as well as hydrocarbons is attractive, not only because these products are excellent fuels for internal combustion engines, but also because the whole process is considered to be cleaner, sustainable, and carbon-neutral (for example, using CO2 from atmosphere, H2 from water splitting and sunlight for energy). However, their chemical and physical properties, are inferior to conventional gasoline. Our distribution systems were developed for liquid fuel. It is easier and less costly to use the existing distribution infrastructure instead of building a new distribution system for methane or hydrogen. Liquid fuels are also safer than gaseous fuels: 1000 atmospheres (14,696 psi) of CH4 or H2 have the same density than 1 L of liquid fuels at room temperature. However, liquid fuels are much less in danger of explosion during accidents.",
                        "Although methane has a high octane number (120), it is not useful for classic combustion engines. Mesitylene, octane number: 110, xylenes: 115-120, toluene: 111 make excellent components of high-octane fuel (86 to 92 in the US). Finally, whereas the long-term storage of hydrogen is very difficult, a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons can be easily stored for fuel or synthesis application.",
                        "Iron-based heterogeneous catalysts have been intensively studied for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Earlier research showed that bulk iron or iron oxides catalyze CO2 hydrogenation, which mainly produce methane as product. These catalysts were rapidly deactivated due to carbon deposition. Doping of promoters such as potassium, manganese, and copper had significant effect on both the reactivity and selectivity of the iron-based catalysts. Higher olefins and aliphatic hydrocarbons, as well as improved CO2 conversion, were achieved. Al2O3 was found to be an excellent structure promoter to sustain the catalyst activity of iron-based catalysts by preventing sintering of active particles during the reaction. When using zeolites as solid supports, the product's distribution was highly dependent on the structure and acidity of the zeolites. The iron-zeolite composites were also reported as dual functional catalysts that promoted multi-step transformation for CO2 hydrogenation.",
                        "In spite of all the efforts during the last decades, the direct formation of aromatic hydrocarbons in a one-step reaction from carbon dioxide, without forming aliphatic hydrocarbons first, remains elusive."

Catalysts used with the present invention are capable of forming aromatic hydrocarbons directly in a single step at relatively low temperatures (300-560\u00b0 C.), and without further refining or processing of the reaction product. Existing catalysts start from aliphatic hydrocarbons or other waxy semisolids and convert them to aromatic hydrocarbons at temperatures exceeding 1000\u00b0 C.",
                        "The Fischer-Tropsch reaction is generally described by the following reaction:",
                        "CO+2H2\u2192\u2014CH2\u2014+H2O",
                        "However, in one embodiment according to the present invention, the reaction is summarized by the following:",

Preferably, the catalysts are Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The nanoparticles have a BET surface area of from about 20 to about 75 m2/g, preferably about 23 to about 40 m2/g. The nanoparticles have highly crystalline structures formed of nanolattices and comprise both crystalline cores and crystalline shells. Before activation, the catalysts can further comprise an organic ligand monolayer adjacent the shell; however, this ligand layer is removed after the first catalytic reaction to activate the catalyst, and is not a required component for the initial or subsequent reactions. The nanoparticles are not otherwise functionalized, and are preferably free of silane coatings or the like.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the nanocatalysts are supported on a non-reactive support material. For example, the non-reactive support can be a zeolite, aluminum silicate, or \u03b1-alumina, main group element oxide, d-block element oxide and f-block element oxide particles. In certain embodiments the \u03b1-alumina particles have a surface area of between about 100 to about 400 m2/g, and preferably between about 250 to about 350 m2/g (after calcination at 600\u00b0 C.). Also, the surface area of the zeolite, such as zeolite Y, is preferably between about 500 and about 700 m2/g.",
                        "Although not required, and in certain embodiments it is not present, a promoter material may be added to the nanocatalytic material in order to improve the catalyst performance and/or product selectivity. In certain embodiments the promoter comprises one or more metal ions such as potassium, manganese, zinc, or copper ions. In particular embodiments, the promoter is introduced into the nanocatalytic material as K2CO3, ZnCO3, or a mixture thereof.",
                        "In methods of synthesizing the nanocatalyst, the Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles are actually grown upon the support material, as opposed to first being synthesized and then deposited or impregnated into the support. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the nanocatalyst is synthesized by first providing a reaction mixture within a reaction vessel. The reaction mixture comprises a C10-C24 alkene solvent, a C10-C24 amine having at least one ethylenically unsaturated group, a C4-C24 ammonium salt, and the non-reactive support material. In preferred embodiments, the C10-C24 alkene solvent is 1-octadecene, and the C10-C24 amine is oleylamine. Further, in certain embodiments, the C4-C24 ammonium salt is selected from the group consisting of C8-C22 primary alkyl ammonium salts, C4-C24 quaternary ammonium salts, and combinations thereof. In particularly preferred embodiments, the C8-C22 primary alkyl ammonium salt is hexadecylammonium chloride ad the C4-C24 quaternary alkyl ammonium salt is tetraethylammonium chloride.",
                        "The reaction mixture may then be heated to a temperature of between about 150\u00b0 C. to about 210\u00b0 C., or 160\u00b0 C. to about 200\u00b0 C., or about 180\u00b0 C., at which point a quantity of Fe(CO)5 is then added to the reaction mixture. The Fe(CO)5 may be added while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture within the aforementioned levels. The Fe(CO)5 may be added in multiple portions so as to avoid violent Fe(CO)5 reflux. The Fe(CO)5, amine, and ammonium salt ligands react thereby forming a plurality of Fe/Fe3O4 core/shell nanoparticles on the support. The Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles initially comprise an outer organic ligand monolayer formed from the ligands or portions thereof. These ligands can be removed prior to use of the nanocatalyst or during a first run of the nanocatalyst in a CO2 hydrogenation reaction. In order to remove the ligand monolayer, the nanocatalyst is heated to a temperature above 300\u00b0 C., and preferably in the presence of either H2 or CO.",
                        "After the reacting step, the nanoparticles may be recovered from the reaction vessel. Typically, the nanocatalyst is permitted to cool to room temperature and then washed (such as with hexane followed by ethanol) to remove free or unattached ligands, and then dried and recovered as a fine powder. Methods of synthesizing unsupported Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles are very similar to that described above, except that the support material is not introduced into the initial reaction mixture.",
                        "In use, the nanocatalyst is contacted with a gas feedstock to produce a mixture of hydrocarbons wherein the majority (\u226751% by weight) of the reaction product mixture is aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably C6-C9 aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as mesitylene, xylenes, toluene, benzene, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, greater than about 75% by weight of the reaction product comprises aromatic hydrocarbons, and more preferably greater than about 85% by weight of the reaction product comprises aromatic hydrocarbons, and even more preferably greater than about 90% by weight of the reaction product comprises aromatic hydrocarbons. The reaction product preferably comprises less than about 30% by weight waxy solids or semisolids (e.g., paraffins), more preferably less than about 20% by weight, and even more preferably less than about 10% by weight waxy solids or semisolids. In addition to providing a high concentration of aromatic hydrocarbon compound reaction products, in certain embodiments of the present invention the distribution of reaction products comprising greater than 1% by weight of the overall reaction product composition is limited to fewer than 15 hydrocarbon compounds, fewer than 12 hydrocarbon compounds, fewer than 10 hydrocarbon compounds or fewer than 8 hydrocarbon compounds. In other embodiments, the aromatic hydrocarbon compound distribution is even narrower with mesitylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, m-xylene, toluene and benzene comprising the majority of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds produced. Various aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds such as propane and butane may also be produced, but each generally in amounts of less than 10%, less than 7.5%, less than 5%, or less than 3% by weight.",
                        "More specifically, a reaction vessel or reactor is provided, which contains the nanocatalyst. The nanocatalyst can be on a non-reactive support substrate, as described above, in the reaction vessel, or the nanocatalyst can be suspended in a magnetic field in the reaction vessel. A gas feedstock is introduced into the reaction vessel. The feed stream will comprise a source of carbon atoms and a source of hydrogen atoms. In certain embodiments, the feed stream may comprise CO2, H2, CO, and/or H2O, sources of CO2, Hz, CO (e.g., C1-C5 aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds), and/or H2O, and/or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments a system using separate feed streams to deliver the feedstock to the reaction vessel for some or all of the feedstock gasses (or water) can be used. Advantageously, the catalyst is not dependent on the exact ratio of CO2 and H2 (9/24 in the reaction above) in the feedstock and is able to produce principally the same (aromatic) products even when the input concentrations of CO2 and H2 vary, oscillate, etc. However, in certain embodiments the molar ratio of H2 to CO2 is from about 1:5 to about 5:1, from about 1:1 to about 4:1, or from about 1.5:1 to about 3:1. This makes this catalyst ideal for the production of fuel from syngas. If H2 is not available, the catalyst can convert CO and H2O to CO2 and H2 via the following reaction scheme:",

                        "It will be appreciated that the feedstock can be delivered using any suitable system, including storage systems such as a gas cylinder or other container, as well as the direct or indirect product from another process. The gas feedstock will be reacted with the nanocatalyst in the reaction vessel. The reaction temperature will range from about 300\u00b0 C. to about 560\u00b0 C., about 380\u00b0 C. to about 500\u00b0 C., or from about 400\u00b0 C. to 450\u00b0 C. In certain embodiments, elevated pressures are not required for the reaction, which can typically be carried out at 1 to 10 atm, more preferably at 1 to 1.1 atm. However, elevated pressures from 1.1-100 atm may be used if desired. The reaction yields a product stream that can be collected from the reaction vessel. The reaction can be carried out for a time period of from about 20 to about 120 minutes, and preferably from about 30 to about 60 minutes before collecting the product stream from the reaction vessel. A continuous reaction process could also be used. Advantageously, the nanocatalyst can be used for multiple passes or runs (i.e., reactions) without losing its efficiency or needing to be regenerated. In some embodiments, the nanocatalyst can be used for at least about 10 reactions (\u201ccatalytic cycles\u201d) before being regenerated, and more preferably at least about 15 reactions before being regenerated. It is estimated that one mol of catalyst is able to convert 10,000-50,000 moles of CO2 before the catalyst needs to regenerated.",

As disclosed herein, the reaction temperature can be adjusted to control the reaction products and target the formation of specific aromatic compounds. The aromatic hydrocarbons can be used directly as fuels or additives without the need for further refining."

In the first step, an iron nanoparticle catalyzed reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction produces CO from CO2. This reaction permits that either H2 or CO can be used as starting materials for the synthesis of fuels.

This reaction leads to the deposition of carbon onto the catalyst. However, graphite has a tendency to form planar layers, where Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles feature an extreme curvature that prevents the formation of carbon layers and thus the deactivation of the catalyst. It is believed that nanocatalysts possessing a diameter, which is smaller than 20 nm are protected from carbon layer formation by their size. Carbon is stored as Fe3C.",
