                        "Lymph nodes are small glands that filter lymphatic fluid which is a clear fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system, part of the immune system, is a network of ducts that carry the lymphatic fluid (LF). LF also contains white blood cells called lymphocytes, fats, and proteins. The lymphatic system extracts LF from the body and after purifying it from infectious organisms and abnormal cells, carries it into the bloodstream. In many types of cancers, especially breast carcinoma, a lymph node is the first location being invaded by cancer cells through lymphatic vessels. Hence, breast tumor invasion to a sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first sign of disease progression and metastasis. So, detection of lymph node metastasis is crucial in designation of treatment protocol by an oncologist.",
                        "Although SLN involvement may be found during an interventional radiology (Ultrasonography and biopsy) in many cases, it is mandatory to dissect the SLNs (either it is involved or free in biopsy result) in patients with invasive breast carcinoma to be sent for intraoperative frozen section. If the SLN is involved, the surgeon must dissect at least six auxiliary lymph nodes (ALNs) and if the SLNs are free from cancer cells it is not mandatory to dissect further lymph nodes.",
                        "Currently, the only common method for detection of metastatic cancer cells in lymph (sentinel and auxiliary) nodes during surgery is frozen pathology which is highly dependent on the experience and skills of a pathologist. Due to the lack of time in a frozen section to respond to a surgeon, just a part of a removed lymph node (due to color, stiffness, and firmness) is often selected for frozen examination. So, in some cases, pathological mistakes in missing an involved LNs might be occurred in the frozen section, and cancer cells might be missed and assumed as histiocytes.",
                        "So, there is a lack of a real-time noninvasive, simple and reliable method to detect metastatic lymph nodes. Hence, there is a need for an instrument, method and system that is capable of detecting cancer involved LNs via an accurate, real-time responding, noninvasive, uncomplicated, and reliable approach. Furthermore, there is a need for an instrument, method and system for accurate diagnosis of cancer involved lymph nodes to prevent from removing normal lymph nodes and/or remaining cancer involved lymph nodes, which are crucial in programming a treating procedure of a patient."

                        "Early detection of cancer involved lymph nodes (LNs) is crucial in preparing a therapeutical and treatment plan for a cancer patient. Metabolism of cancer cells metastasize to LNs is very complicated. Metabolism of cancer cells metastasized to LNs is changed from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Expression of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) selectively activates FAO-related genes in metastatic lymphatic tumors. Consequently, activated FAO-related genes in tumors that have metastasized to lymph will stimulate metabolism toward FAO rather than glycolysis. As a result of activation of FAO, environment of a metastasized lymph node would be acidic.",

Herein, \u201ccancer involved LNs\u201d may refer to either a cancerous lymph node, or a lymph node invaded by metastatic cancer cells, or in other words, metastasis of cancer cells to a lymph node. An exemplary instrument and an exemplary method based on acidification of cancer involved LNs due to fatty acid oxidation metabolism of cancer cells in LNs are disclosed here. An exemplary method may include calibrating live pH of SLNs by pathological assays results, so exemplary method may allow for diagnosing metastatic SLNs with no need for any lymph node dissection prior to cancer diagnosis. An exemplary method described herein may allow for preserving free SLNs for the patient, whereas through frozen method even if a SLN is free from a tumor or cancer cells, a patient looses his/her SLNs which may cause many side effects for him/her such as lymphedema, lost or decreased sensation in back of arm or armpit region, and tingling, numbness, stiffness in armpit, etc. In an exemplary implementation, an exemplary method may be disclosed for diagnosis of breast cancer via measuring pH value of lymphatic fluid of a lymph node at armpits. Exemplary method may be based on metastasis and invasion of breast cancer cells to SLNs at armpits, so that an acidic pH may be detected for SLNs due to metabolism of cancer cells there.",

In an exemplary embodiment, when metastatic cancer cells invade to lymphatic system, cancer cells may enter inside a lymph node and the lymph node may become a metastatic lymph node or a cancer involved lymph node.

A micro-syringe (gauge 18, with an inner diameter of 838 \u03bcm of needle) was filled with about 100 \u03bcl of injectable sterile PBS and the syringe needle was embedded by a thin litmus paper. The mechanism included inserting the needle inside LNs, injection of PBS rubbing LNs, and checking color of litmus paper which indicated the acidity or basicity of lymph node fluid based on lipid synthesis of cancer cells in LNs. This procedure may be individually repeated utilizing three needles and if even one of the needles showed acidic pH with pH equal to or lower than 6 (as experimentally was calibrated); then, the LN was declared as a cancer involved LN. Exemplary instruments and syringes were sterilized after being manufactured under the plasma sterile protocol (Standard Number: ISO/NP 22441).",
                                "In-vitro fresh lymph node samples were prepared from 25 patients' candidate for breast cancer that were recorded from 2018-10-30 to 2019-11-30. By real-time and precise pH sensing of LNs, one might achieve a calibration pattern to distinguish normal LNs from metastatic LNs. To achieve this calibration, 100 \u03bcl PBS was injected to SLNs immediately after dissection and MMLD was entered to the SLNs. Then, pH value of lymphatic fluid was read based on the color of litmus paper and the acidity or basicity of the lymph node fluid was detected.",
                                "In addition to exemplary pH sensing based method, lymph node samples were tested and analyzed by pathologic assays via Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining which is the most routine staining procedure in histopathology. After pathological evaluation of the SLNs, the pH and cancer diagnosis result of each LN were recorded in Table 1 herein below. It should be noted that H&E staining is a combination of two dyes. Hematoxylin and Eosin are used to demonstrate the nucleus and cytoplasmic inclusions in clinical specimens. Hematoxylin, which contains Alum, stains the nucleus in light blue. In the presence of an acid, the dye turns into the red. Therefore, by treating the tissue with an acid solution, the differentiation is achieved. In the bluing step, the initial soluble is converted to red color within the nucleus to an insoluble blue color. By utilizing Eosin, the counterstaining is done, which imparts pink color to the cytoplasm. The initial step of the H&E staining process is deparaffinized a tissue section and flaming the slide on a burner and placing it in the xylene. The process treatment must be repeated afterward, and the hydration process should be done. To hydrate a tissue section, one should pass it through a decreasing concentration of alcohol baths and water (100%, 90%, 80%, and 70%). Then, the sample should be stained in hematoxylin for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, in the next step, it should be washed in running tap water until sections \u201cblue\u201d for 5 minutes or less. In the next level, the sample should be placed in 1% acid alcohol (1% HCL in 70% alcohol) for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the sample should be washed in running tap water until it turns into blue again by dipping in an alkaline solution (e.g., ammonia water) followed by tap water washing process. Furthermore, in 1% Eosin Y for 10 minutes, the sample is stained and should be washed in tap water for 1-5 minutes. Finally, to dehydrate the sample, one should dip it in increasing concentration of alcohol and clear in xylene.",

Some of them were normal and some others were metastatic due to pathological evaluations (Table 1). Changes in pH value of LNs from more than 7 in healthy LNs to less than 6 in cancerous ones, may indicate well differentiation ability of lymphatic fluid (LF) pH as metastasis indicator. Results obtained by exemplary MMLD were compared by frozen section diagnostics based on permanent H&E of lymph nodes as a gold standard. Regarding Table 1, positive samples are indicated with positive sign (+) and negative samples are indicated with negative sign (\u2212). Among 65 samples, MMLD had only 1 false-positive and 1 false-negative for patient's ID 16 (sample ID 48) and patient's ID 5 (sample ID 12).
