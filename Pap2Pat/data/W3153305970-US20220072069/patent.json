Staphylococcus species, in particular S. aureus, Streptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or fungi. In acne vulgaris, a frequent skin disease mainly of adolescents and young adults, there are indications that the anaerobic bacterium Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) is co-causing the symptoms (Beylot, C. et al., a.a.O.).",
                        "In these skin disorders, antibiotics are often applied as primary or supporting therapy, either topically or systemically.

                        "Another unwanted secondary effect of the use of antibiotics is the increasingly problematic development of antibiotic resistances to such an extent that, especially in hospitals, no effective antibiotic for treatment of serious infections may be available (Bassetti, M. et al., 2017). Thus, alternative ways for treatment of skin disorders, attributable to the action of microorganisms, avoiding the use of antibiotics or at least reducing the length of antibiotic therapy are much-needed.",

The pouch may be part of a plaster or patch which can be applied to the diseased skin.",
                        "The invention provides a formulation comprising two membranes, one of them being semipermeable, which allows water and other substances from the skin to diffuse into the pouch and metabolic products of the enclosed probiotic bacteria to diffuse through it and to thereby get in contact with the diseased skin. The semipermeable membrane does not allow the enclosed probiotics to permeate through the membrane pores. The second membrane may be chemically identical to the first membrane, but it is water-impermeable and thus protects the probiotic from contact with the surroundings.",
                        "The semipermeable membrane of the composition is required to have a pore size which does not allow penetration of the bacteria. Consequently, a pore size smaller than the size of the enclosed bacteria is suitable. That is, the semipermeable membrane is any membrane suitable for microfiltration. Therefore, the semipermeable membrane preferably has a pore size of at least 0.1 \u03bcm, preferably 0.1 \u03bcm to 0.4 \u03bcm, and more preferably 0.15 to 0.25 \u03bcm.",
                        "According to the invention, the water-impermeable membrane is defined to have no pores in the sense that it does neither allow penetration of water molecules in liquid state nor of larger molecules.",
                        "Shape and size of pores in membranes largely depend from the manufacturing process and can generally be specified only with difficulties. Therefore, the pore size for membranes is usually determined by test filtrations, and the pore size is designated as the diameter of the smallest particle which did not pass the membrane. That is, the pore size is determined indirectly and is merely a cut-off size.",
                        "Any commercially available semipermeable membrane is suitable for the invention as long as it is suitable for pharmaceutical topical application. The pore size is given by the manufacturer.",
                        "Further, it is required, in order to produce a pouch, that the margins of the semipermeable and the impermeable membrane can be tightly sealed together by heat or other techniques which are not harmful for the enclosed bacteria. Sealing of the two membranes can, as an example, be carried out with a commercially available film sealing device with temperature control such as \u201cFermant 22\u201d (joke renotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) at temperatures of 170 to 280\u00b0 C., preferably 230 to 275\u00b0 C. Other conventional sealing methods are equally suitable",
                        "The semipermeable membrane according to the invention is preferably but not exclusively made from polycarbonate. Any other polymer fulfilling the criteria mentioned before can also be used in the invention. Suitable polymers for the semipermeable membrane are polyethersulfone, polysulfone cellulose, cellulosic esters (e.g. cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate), silicones, polyamides, polyamide imide, polyamide urea, polyacryl nitrile, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluorethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl chloride, polypiperazine amide. Combinations of these polymers layered in at least two thin films are also suitable.",
                        "For the water-impermeable membrane, any polymer material is suitable which cannot be permeated by liquid water and which can be sealed, e.g. by heat, with the semipermeable membrane as described above. Preferably, for better sealability with the semipermeable membrane, the same polymer type is used. Particularly preferred is polycarbonate.",
                        "The two membranes in the desired shape and size are sealed as explained above at three sides before the insert is introduced (see below), thus forming a pouch.",
                        "The thickness of the polymer materials can be appropriately selected. Usually, the water-impermeable membrane has a thickness of 0.01 to 0.10 mm, preferably 0.015 to 0.025 mm and the semipermeable membrane may have a thickness of 0.002 to 0.02 mm, preferably 0.075 mm.",
                        "A material suitable as insert in pharmaceutical plasters, such as a commercially available nonwoven, is then inserted into the pouch. As material for the insert, any material which does not interfere with the probiotics can be used. Examples are nonwovens made of viscose or polypropylene, polyesters, polyamides and mixtures thereof. Further, commonly known polyurethane foams are suitable as insert material. The insert materials usually have a high water-absorption such as 500 to 2200 g/m2, preferably 920 to 980 g/m2 in order to be able to absorb the probiotic suspension.",
                        "The pouch with the insert is then heat-sterilized, e.g. by autoclaving at 121\u00b0 C. for 20 min.",
                        "The probiotic is subsequently applied to the insert within the pouch in form of a suspension. Preferably, the same culture medium such as MRS broth used for the initial cultivation is used as suspension liquid. Suitable protectants such as trehalose can be added to the suspension. The suspension is adjusted so that it contains 1.5 to 4.5\u00d71010 CFU probiotic bacteria per ml, preferably 2 to 4\u00d71010 CFU/ml, most preferably 3\u00d71010 CFU/ml.",

A particularly preferable Lactobacillus species used according to the invention is L. plantarum, and the most preferable strain is L. plantarum 8P-A3 (DSM 32835). S. salivarius K12 is a strain used in commercially available probiotic preparations BLIS K12\u2122 probiotic powder. S. salivarius M18 is a strain contained in commercially available probiotic dental care products such as ProBio-Dent, Life Extension FLORASSIST, Bio-Kick M18 Zahn. K12 and M18 are strains which have been found by Professor John Tagg of the Microbiology Department at the University of Otago and later-on developed to probiotic nutrition supplements by the company BLIS Technologies, Dunedin, New Zealand.",

In this way, diffusible antimicrobial products (i.e. metabolites) produced by the probiotics (but not the bacteria/probiotics themselves) can reach the skin. The antimicrobial metabolites exert the pharmaceutical effect of the inventive formulation on the diseased skin, whereas the probiotic bacteria do not get into contact therewith.",
                        "The thus-obtained patch can further be supplemented with common means for fixation at the skin, such as an adhesive tape which is commonly used in plasters. The adhesive tape can be provided in a manner that it covers the complete surface of the patch, or it can be provided only on at least one of the margins. The adhesive side can be protected by a commonly known release film which is removed before applying the formulation onto the skin.",
                        "Further, a commonly known fibre material or a net-like material such as gauze which functions as protective layer can be provided between the water-impermeable (upper) side of the patch and the adhesive tape.",
                        "The thus obtained formulation is designated as plaster or bandage. It can also be designated as transdermal therapeutic system of the reservoir type. Although the mechanism of action is not transdermal in the strict sense, the structure of the plaster is similar to usual transdermal therapeutic patches and thus this designation is used for the inventive formulation.",
                        "The number of patches and/or plasters which are applied to the diseased skin is selected appropriately. At least one plaster or patch is applied, but the number can be larger depending on the area to be covered and the different sites which need treatment. For example, one plaster (or one patch) can be applied on the forehead, one on the chin, one or more on each cheek, respectively, one on the nose and/or one on other parts of the skin if acne is to be treated on the complete face.",
                        "The patch(es)/plaster(s) can remain on the skin for an appropriate time of up to 24 h, and then the patch(s)/plaster(s) can be removed and replaced by fresh patch(es)/plasters, if needed.",
                        "In a suitable way they can be applied intermittently only during the night, which may enhance patient compliance in particular if the application is on the face, whereas during the day the skin is left as it is or treated with common cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations such as creams, lotions or the like, respectively.",
                        "A commonly known hydrogel, such as a commercially available hydrogel, can be applied onto the skin immediately prior to the application of the patch(es) or plaster(s) in order to accomplish a tight contact to the skin surface.",

                        "\u201cViable\u201d is defined as the ability to multiply via binary fission under the controlled conditions. This can be determined by in-vitro culturing in liquid media and under culture conditions suitable for the respective probiotic bacterial strain.",
                        "Appropriate known protectants and protective packaging provide the required stability. Depending on the probiotic in the patch the protectants to be applied in suitable amounts are for example, but not exclusively: (I) disaccharides like trehalose, sucrose, maltose, lactose; (II) polyols like sorbitol and mannitol; (Ill) oligosaccharides and polysaccharides like galacto-oligosaccharides, inulin, starch, and maltodextrins; (IV) amino acids and peptides like glutamic acid and glutathione; (V) other like ascorbic acid, ectoine and hydroxyectoine. They may be used either as single compound or in combination of two or more compounds.",
                        "The invention provides a formulation which is activated when applied onto diseased skin, whereby water and other substances from the skin surface diffuse into the pouch to induce metabolism, growth, and production of antimicrobial substances of the enclosed probiotics.",
                        "The thus-reactivated formulation can deliver antimicrobially active substances (in particular the metabolites produced by the probiotic) onto the skin by diffusion through the semipermeable membrane. It is active by inhibition of growth and killing of human skin pathogens, for example of the taxonomic units Staphylococcus including S. aureus (also methicillin-resistant [MRSA]), Streptococcus including S. pyogenes and S. dysgalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae including Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes. Its activity against other skin pathogens is not excluded. In particular, the inventive formulation exerts its activity against Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",
                        "By applying the inventive formulation, the incidence and/or severity of a skin disorder is reduced accordingly.",
                        "The antimicrobial activity of the composition allows its application to treat\u2014but not exclusively\u2014the following skin disorders (or at least support their treatment): acne vulgaris, infected burn wounds, infected venous leg ulcers, superinfected lesions in atopic dermatitis patients. Other skin disorders might be positively influenced.",
                        "The application of the composition also is expected to have a cosmetic effect on normal skin, in particular of the face. For example, it is expected that wrinkles and/or fine lines can be reduced, hydration of the skin can be improved, thereby reducing a dry feeling, and/or a luminous complexion can be achieved.",
                        "In a special embodiment, the Lactobacillus plantarum, strain 8P-A3 (Tsapieva, A. et al., 2011), or another Lactobacillus strain having at least 97% sequence similarity with SEQ ID No 1 in its 16S rRNA gene is used by the topical formulation as defined above according to the invention.",
                        "Sequence similarity is ascertained by determining the nucleotide sequence of the 16S RNA gene of the strain by an established sequencing method with low error rate, e g. the Sanger (chain termination) method and alignment of the respective sequences with NCBI BLAST.",
                        "Biologically pure is used in the present invention according to the common understanding of the skilled person. The term means that besides the strain of interest no other bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms are detectable.",
