    "title": "A New Approach to Harness Probiotics Against Common Bacterial Skin Pathogens: Towards Living Antimicrobials",
    "date": "2021-04-15",
    "abstract": "In this study, the potential of certain lactic acid bacteria-classified as probiotics and known to be antimicrobially active against pathogens or food-poisoning microorganisms-was evaluated with respect to their activity against bacterial skin pathogens. The aim of the study was to develop a plaster/bandage for the application of inhibitory substances produced by these probiotics when applied to diseased skin. For this purpose, two Streptococcus salivarius strains and one Lactobacillus plantarum were tested for production of antimicrobials (bacteriocin-like substances) active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens using established methods. A newly designed membrane test ensured that the probiotics produce antimicrobials diffusible through membranes. Target organisms used were Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the L. plantarum 8P-A3 strain was tested against additional bacteria involved in skin disorders. The Lactobacillales used were active against all potential skin pathogens tested. These probiotics could be enclosed between polymer membranes-one tight, the other permeable for their products, preserved by vacuum drying, and reactivated after at least three months storage. Importantly, the reactivated pads containing the probiotics demonstrated antibacterial activity on agar plates against all pathogens tested. This suggests that the probiotic containing pads may be topically applied for the treatment of skin disorders without the need for a regular antibiotic treatment or as an adjunctive therapy.",

                "The worldwide rising problem of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [1, 2] calls for searches for alternative and/or adjunctive ways of antimicrobial therapy [3\u20137]. In addition to the selective pressure any use of antibiotics exerts, there are other restrictions for the application of antibiotics such as allergy against many groups of antibiotics [8]. There are also reports that non-antibiotic antiseptics, topically applied to diseased skin and mucous membranes or to infected wounds, might be less active due to development of resistances; those might also pose problems with allergic reactions [9].",
                "Considering this, the employment of probiotic bacteria producing bacteriocin-like substances for topical application onto the skin to treat skin disorders associated with bacterial pathogens might be an alternative to the topical or systemic use of antibiotics or the application of antiseptics [10, 11]. We are using the term \u201cprobiotic\u201d here\u2014in the sense of \u201cbeneficial bacteria\u201d\u2014since the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) applied were originally employed by the oral route. Probiotics from different bacterial taxonomic units have been described to be applied for treatment or prevention of diseases directly onto surfaces of the human body, e.g., the oral cavity or the skin. Examples for this are the application of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius (commonly abbreviated as S. salivarius) strain K12 or S. salivarius M18 for the prevention of sore throat caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and the prevention of pneumococcal otitis media, or for prophylaxis of dental caries, respectively [12\u201316]. Also, other probiotics are considered or already on the market to be applied directly onto the skin for cosmetic or medical treatment purposes [17, 18]. Extracts from probiotic bacteria were also discussed to be used for skin applications [19\u201322].",
                "Skin disorders which are treated with antibiotics (among other therapeutic measures) include acne (Acne vulgaris), infected atopic eczema lesions, venous leg ulcers, and (burn) wound infections [23\u201326]. The respective pathogens associated with these diseases comprise the Gram-positive bacteria Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) and Staphylococcus aureus [27], and Gram-negative rods like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacterales (E. coli, Klebsiella spp. etc.), and others [28].",
                "Consequently, we studied the in vitro activity of selected probiotic Lactobacillales strains against those common skin pathogens, including antibiotic resistant strains. The probiotics were applied in a unique way by enclosing them between membranes, thereby allowing their products to diffuse onto surfaces inoculated with the pathogens. This should serve as a model for a \u201cprobiotic pad\u201d (bandage, plaster, patch) to be applied for the treatment of various skin disorders.",
                "Strains of S. salivarius and Lactobacillus plantarum\u2014for the sake of convenience, we use the former nomenclature for Lactobacillus species instead of the recent changes [29] in this publication\u2014were extensively studied in recent years either as probiotics conferring health benefits to the host or as natural food preservatives, and their efficiency and safety have been proved [12\u201316, 30\u201336]. Bacteria produce a wide range of inhibitory substances: classical low-molecular weight antibiotics, metabolic products, lytic agents, enzymes, bacteriocins, and \u201cdefective prophages\u201d [37]. LAB are known to be producers of metabolic products exerting antimicrobial activity: organic acids, especially lactic acid (giving the name as LAB to this vast group of bacteria), hydrogen peroxide, and diacetyl. The LAB S. salivarius K12, S. salivarius M18, and L. plantarum 8P-A3 used here are additionally able to secrete small ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins), a feature increasing their antagonistic activity against other bacteria as described previously and deduced from comparative genomic data [38\u201343].",
                "The increasing concerns over uncritical antibiotic treatments of skin disorders, in particular Acne vulgaris [23], and of wound infections have led to considerations of the use of alternative treatment methods, in particular the application of probiotic bacteria or their antimicrobial products. Although the spectrum of bacteriocins produced by probiotic bacteria is usually narrow and restricted to close relatives of the producers, there are exceptions described in the literature with probiotic LAB having broader spectra including common pathogens [41, 44, 45].",
                "We decided for this novel approach to apply the probiotic bacteria not directly onto the skin but enclosed between membranes for the following reasons: Although bacteria used as orally administered probiotics are generally regarded as safe (GRAS-status, in some countries approved as such), their direct application onto diseased skin may involve a residual risk, especially in immunocompromised patients or patients with unknown immune status. It is well known that some Lactobacillales, in particular \u201cviridans\u201d streptococcal species, are common causes of sepsis in immunosuppressed patients [46\u201348].",
                "The concept of enclosing microorganism between membranes and switching off and on their metabolism by diffusion of nutrients and water and thereby delivering metabolites to the outside environment had been proven with the fungus Penicillium roqueforti [49]. We decided to use living beneficial bacteria and their antimicrobial potential instead of purified bacteriocins, thereof, because these bacteria are often able to produce several antimicrobially active substances simultaneously, depending on their growth cycle and quorum-sensing machinery. In this approach, environmental stimuli such as external inducers for bacteriocin production [50, 51]\u2014either from skin bacterial flora or from skin cells\u2014may diffuse into the enclosure thus enhancing the antimicrobial product yield."

Assuming that another Lactobacillus strain as indicator bacterium is not sensitive to lactic acid but may be sensitive to the bacteriocin(s) of L. plantarum 8P-A3, we selected the L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis strain DSM-16365. This was based on the fact that the genome of strain DSM-16365 (GenBank accession no. CP032751) is lacking the bacteriocin locus present in the genome of L. plantarum 8P-A3 (Genbank acc. no. CP046726) [41]. This information was deduced from a nucleotide alignment of the bacteriocin locus of L. plantarum 8P-A3 to the chromosome of strain DSM-16365, using the alignment algorithm included in the Geneious Prime\u00ae bioinformatics software package (version 2020.1.2, https://www.geneious.com)\u2014see Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Material.",

                "In the present study, three selected probiotics (S. salivarius K12, S. salivarius M18, and Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3) were tested for their antimicrobial activity against the common skin and wound pathogens C. acnes, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. Pads containing these probiotics in a dried state were constructed and tested for their antimicrobial activity after reactivation on agar surfaces as a substitute for infected skin as target. Additionally, L. plantarum 8P-A3 containing pads were tested against selected strains from culture collections and clinical isolates\u2014some multi-resistant\u2014of Acinetobacter baumannii, C. acnes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis.",
                "The advantage of employing probiotics (or their products) being antimicrobially active even against multi-resistant pathogens may be further supported by the assumption that a loss of activity against the targeted pathogens is still an unlikely or rare event [44, 45], in contrast to the frequent development of resistances to antibiotics commonly used against skin pathogens.",
                "In our approach to tackle the problems associated with topical or systemic antibiotic treatments of skin and superficial wound infections, we decided for the use of live probiotic bacteria enclosed in the dormant state within polymer membranes in such a way, that\u2014after reactivation\u2014their antimicrobial products could diffuse through a semipermeable membrane on the skin-directed side [58]. We had chosen this construct to avoid a direct contact of the skin with the probiotics and subsequent colonization with them, but still allowing their diffusible products to act on diseased skin or infected wounds. The rationale behind this is to avoid an entry of the probiotics as opportunistic pathogens into the bloodstream of potentially immunosuppressed persons [46\u201348, 64].",
                "To gain information if the selected probiotic bacterial strains (S. salivarius K12, S. salivarius M18, and L. plantarum 8P-A3; Table 1) are able to inhibit potential skin pathogens, we first applied established methods to one representative strain each of C. acnes, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa (Table 2). The good activities of L. plantarum 8P-A3 seen here against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are well in accordance with the results previously obtained for these pathogens by Tsapieva et al. [41]. Antimicrobial activity of S. salivarius K12 against S. aureus had also been reported previously [38].",
                "Pads containing the three probiotic bacteria were able to inhibit the growth of all target bacteria listed in Table 2 (Figs. 4a, b and S9a\u2013e). Upon application of the pads to human skin, it may be necessary to provide an additional water source for reactivation of the dried bacteria within the pads. To simulate the conditions on human skin, we tested the pads on agar with a hydrogel as an interface between the pads and the agar surface. This hydrogel did not interfere with the antimicrobial activity of the pads (probiotic-free control pads stayed inactive; Figs. 4a and S9a, b, and e). Besides providing water, application of such a hydrogel between the pads and the skin might provide a more intense contact to the rough surfaces of the skin.",
                "As expected, we could demonstrate that the pads had maintained their antagonistic activity\u2014viz. could be reactivated\u2014after storage for at least three months in a desiccator at room temperature (Fig. S9e). Using a deferred method for testing the pads against the aerobe P. aeruginosa, the facultative anaerobe S. aureus, and the anaerobe C. acnes, we could demonstrate that a direct contact with the target pathogens (or products thereof) is not essential for sufficient production of inhibitory substances by the probiotic LAB chosen here (examples in Figs. 3, 4b, S8, and S9c and d).",
                "L. plantarum 8P-A3 was also able to inhibit the growth of additional strains of S. aureus, C. acnes, and P. aeruginosa including the clinical isolates from these species listed in Table 3. Moreover, pads containing this probiotic inhibited other Gram-positives such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis as well as the Gram-negatives Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. These results are in agreement with the previous publication of Tsapieva et al. [41]; according to their data and our results, L. plantarum 8P-A3 can be considered as suitable probiotic to be further developed against skin pathogens using the approach described here.",
                "Using the L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis DSM-16365 as target bacterium, we could prove that the antibacterial activity of the pads containing L. plantarum 8P-A3 is probably caused by bacteriocin(s) and in any case not exclusively based on the action of lactic acid and/or hydrogen peroxide. We concluded this from the fact that under the conditions selected, namely, use of a production medium with low glucose content, anaerobic atmosphere, and low sensitivity of this LAB indicator bacterium for lactic acid, cultures of L. plantarum 8P-A3 exerted clear inhibition in the modified spot-on-the-lawn test.",
                "Thus, there is good indication that the activity of the L. plantarum 8P-A3 containing pads is\u2014at least in part\u2014due to the diffusion and action of one or more bacteriocins produced by this probiotic. From the published nucleotide sequences of the plantaricin (pln) locus [41] and the whole genome of L. plantarum 8P-A3 (GenBank Acc. Nos. HQ651181 and CP046726.1 resp.) and comparison with other published sequences from L. plantarum strains, one can deduce that the following class IIb bacteriocins might be produced by our selected producer strain L. plantarum 8P-A3: plantaricin EF [65] and/or plantaricin NC8\u03b1/\u03b2 [66, 67]. This had already been assumed by Tsapieva et al. on the basis of the pln locus sequence they had described [41]. They also had found that the plantaricin locus in the genome of the L. plantarum strain J51 has a nearly complete identical nucleotide sequence [68]. In preliminary experiments\u2014data not shown, we could detect bands of the expected molecular mass of those bacteriocins applying SDS-PAGE of a concentrated, antimicrobially active culture supernatant of L. plantarum 8P-A3.",
                "The pads with the enclosed probiotic L. plantarum 8P-A3 can be considered as a safe potential device for treating bacteria-associated skin disorders, like Acne vulgaris or superinfected skin lesions, e.g., in atopic dermatitis. Also, the broad antibacterial spectrum including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa confirmed here that it might be useful for even treating chronic wounds associated with venous leg ulcers or burn wounds as described recently for a different L. plantarum strain [69]. The safety of the pads with enclosed L. plantarum 8P-A3 developed here is also based on the finding that no gene for an acquired antibiotic resistance is present in this probiotic and that a direct contact with the living probiotic bacteria is avoided\u2014as discussed above.",
                "In contrast to the use of extracts or supernatants from probiotic bacteria for treatment of skin disorders described in the literature [17, 19, 21, 22], our construct of pads might lead to an increased yield of active bacteriocins, since products or constituents of the target pathogens could diffuse into the pads and induce bacteriocin production by interference with the quorum sensing system of the probiotics [50, 51].",
                "In addition to the antimicrobial effect of probiotics on skin pathogens, other beneficial effects on the skin microbiome and/or wound healing were described [22, 70] and could result from the application of the probiotic pads. Those could be triggered by known immunomodulatory effects of probiotics [71]. The secreted products may also have beneficial immunomodulatory effects on the skin or on wounds, which are commonly described for the oral route of application of some probiotic strains\u2014for review see [72].",
                "However, also unfavorable effects on the skin microbiome may be possible: inhibiting beneficial strains of C. acnes or of S. epidermidis may lead to perturbation of the skin microbiome and to an exacerbation of the disease intended to treat [35, 73\u201375].",
                "In conclusion, we present in vitro data on the broad antimicrobial activity of selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria against common skin pathogens. Moreover, we report on design and testing of patches (bandages, pads or plasters) enclosing those probiotics and intended for topical treatment of skin disorders and infected wounds.",
                "To develop these patches further for cosmetic or medical applications, we consider the following studies as essential:Isolation, purification, and characterization of the bacteriocins produced by the L. plantarum 8P-A3 strain;Tests for in vitro activity against additional C. acnes isolates, especially those isolated from acne lesions and belonging to established acne-associated clones [75\u201377];Application of the pads to ex-vivo human skin and analysis of the microbiome changes and associated immunological parameters;A phase I clinical study in humans.",
                "Those studies are in progress/projected in our laboratory now."
