                        "Spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes permanent paralysis. In mammals. SCI results in formation of scar tissue at the lesion site, which acts as a barrier to axon regeneration and functional recovery (Bradbury E J, et al. (2019) Nature. 10(1):3879; He Z, et al. (2016) Neuron. 90(3):437-451; Sofroniew M V (2018) Nature. 447(7704):343-350; Tran A P, et al. (2018) Physiol. Rev. 98(2):881-917). By contrast, certain non-mammalian vertebrates like zebrafish can regenerate spinal cord tissue and reverse paralysis, including after complete transection injuries in adults (Becker T, et al. (1997) J Comp Neurol. 377:577-595; Bernstein J J (1964) Exp Neurol. 9:161-174; Butler E G, et al. (1967) Dev Biol. 15:464-486; Cohen A H, et al. (1986) Proc Natl Acad Sci. USA 83:2763-2766; McClellan A D (1990) Neuroscience. 35:675-685; Piatt J, et al. (1958) Anat Rec. 131:81-95; Rovainen C M (1976) J Comp Neurol. 168:545-554; Selzer M E (1978) J Physiol. 277:395-408).",
                        "For instance, SCI in adult zebrafish triggers proliferation of ependymal radial glial cells (ERGs), after which they are proposed to differentiate into new glial cells and neurons (Becker C G, et al. (2015) Dev Cell. 32:516-527; Cigliola V. et al. (2020) Dis Model Mech. 13). A subpopulation of glial derivatives form bridges between the rostral and caudal stumps, events that depend on signaling by fibroblast growth factors and connective tissue growth factor, the latter of which is expressed in an early population of bridging glia (Goldshmit Y. et al. (2012) J Neurosci. 32:7477-7492; Mokalled, et al. (2016) Science. 354:630-634). A variety of intrinsic and extracellular factors have been implicated in guidance of axon across the lesion site in adult zebrafish, among which are secreted proteins (Sema4D), ECM components (Tenascin-C), scaffolding proteins (Syntenin-A), transcription factors (ATF3 and 6), microRNA (mi133) and immune-cell derived factors (Neurotrophin 3) (Hui S P, et al. (2017) Dev Cell. 43:659-672 e655; Ji Z, et al. (2021) Neurosci. 71:734-745; Peng S X, et al. (2017) Neuroscience. 351:36-46; Wang L F, et al. (2017) Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 488:522-527; Yu Y. et al. (2013) Eur J Neurosci. 38:2280-2289; Yu Y M, et al. (2011) Neuroscience. 183:238-250). Neonatal mice also mount a microglia-dependent response to spinal cord injury that permits the growth of long projecting axons through lesions (Li Y, et al. (2020) Nature. 587:613-618).",
                        "The key for understanding the capacity for spinal cord regeneration is the identification of mechanisms that promote the rostrocaudal direction of axon regeneration to reconnect long axons with their targets. Accordingly, there is an urgent and previously unmet need to enhance spinal cord tissue regeneration, especially in adult mammals."

A CRISPR system involves two main components: a Cas9 enzyme and a guide (gRNA). The gRNA contains a targeting sequence for DNA binding and a scaffold sequence for Cas9 binding. Cas9 nuclease is often used to \u201cknockout\u201d target genes hence it can be applied for deletion or suppression of oncogenes that are essential for cancer initiation or progression. Similar to ASOs and siRNAs, CRISPR offers a great flexibility in targeting any gene of interest hence, potential CRISPR based therapies can be designed based on the genetic mutation in individual patients. An advantage of CRISPR is its ability to completely ablate the expression of disease genes which can only be suppressed partially by RNA interference methods with ASOs or siRNAs. Furthermore, multiple gRNAs can be employed to suppress or activate multiple genes simultaneously, hence increasing the treatment efficacy and reducing resistance potentially caused by new mutations in the target genes.",

Ubiquitous/constitutive promoters include, but are not limited to, a CMV major immediate-early enhancer/chicken beta-actin promoter, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) major immediate-early promoter, an Elongation Factor 1-\u03b1 (EF1-\u03b1) promoter, a simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) promoter, an AmpR promoter, a P\u03b3K promoter, a human ubiquitin C gene (Ubc) promoter, a MFG promoter, a human beta actin promoter, a CAG promoter, a EGR1 promoter, a FerH promoter, a FerL promoter, a GRP78 promoter, a GRP94 promoter, a HSP70 promoter, a \u03b2-kin promoter, a murine phosphoglycerate kinase (mPGK) or human PGK (hPGK) promoter, a ROSA promoter, human Ubiquitin B promoter, a Rous sarcoma virus promoter, or any other natural or synthetic ubiquitous/constitutive promoters.",
                                "As used herein, an \u201cinducible promoter\u201d refers to a promoter that can be regulated by positive or negative control. Factors that can regulate an inducible promoter include, but are not limited to, chemical agents (e.g., the metallothionein promoter or a hormone inducible promoter), temperature, and light.",
                                "As used herein, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that expression of a gene or a transgene is under the control of a promoter or control element with which it is spatially connected. A promoter can be positioned 5\u2032 (upstream) or 3\u2032 (downstream) of a gene under its control. The distance between the promoter and a gene can be approximately the same as the distance between that promoter and the gene it controls in the gene from which the promoter is derived. As is known in the art, variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function.",
                                "As used herein, an \u201cenhancer\u201d such as a transcription or transcriptional enhancer refers to regulatory DNA segment that is typically found in multicellular eukaryotes. An enhancer can strongly stimulate (\u201cenhance\u201d) the transcription of a linked transcription unit, i.e., it acts in cis. An enhancer can activate transcription over very long distances of many thousand base pairs, and from a position upstream or downstream of the site of transcription initiation. An enhancers can have a modular structure by being composed of multiple binding sites for transcriptional activator proteins. Many enhancers control gene expression in a cell type-specific fashion. Several remote enhancers can control the expression of a singular gene while a singular enhance can stimulate the transcription of one or more genes.",
                                "As used herein, \u201cexpression cassette\u201d or \u201ctransgene cassette\u201d can refer to a distinct component of vector DNA comprising a transgene and one or more regulatory sequences to be expressed by a transfected cell. Generally, an expression cassette or transgene cassette can comprise a promoter sequence, an open reading frame (i.e., the transgene such as, for example, an HB-EGF), and a 3\u2032 untranslated region (e.g., in eukaryotes a polyadenylation site).",
                                "As used herein, an \u201cisolated\u201d biological component (such as a nucleic acid molecule, protein, or virus) has been substantially separated or purified away from other biological components (e.g., other chromosomal and extra-chromosomal DNA and RNA, proteins and/or organelles). Nucleic acids, proteins, and/or viruses that have been \u201cisolated\u201d include nucleic acids, proteins, and viruses purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acids, proteins, and viruses prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell, as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids or proteins. The term \u201cisolated\u201d (or purified) does not require absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative term. Thus, for example, an isolated or purified nucleic acid, protein, virus, or other active compound is one that is isolated in whole or in part from associated nucleic acids, proteins, and other contaminants. In an aspect, the term \u201csubstantially purified\u201d refers to a nucleic acid, protein, virus or other active compound that has been isolated from a cell, cell culture medium, or other crude preparation and subjected to fractionation to remove various components of the initial preparation, such as proteins, cellular debris, and other components.",
                                "\u201cSequence identity\u201d and \u201csequence similarity\u201d can be determined by alignment of two peptide or two nucleotide sequences using global or local alignment algorithms. Sequences may then be referred to as \u201csubstantially identical\u201d or \u201cessentially similar\u201d when they are optimally aligned. For example, sequence similarity or identity can be determined by searching against databases such as FASTA, BLAST, etc., but hits should be retrieved and aligned pairwise to compare sequence identity. Two proteins or two protein domains, or two nucleic acid sequences can have \u201csubstantial sequence identity\u201d if the percentage sequence identity is at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or more, preferably 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or more. Such sequences are also referred to as \u201cvariants\u201d herein, e.g., other variants of glycogen branching enzymes and amylases. It should be understood that sequence with substantial sequence identity do not necessarily have the same length and may differ in length. For example, sequences that have the same nucleotide sequence but of which one has additional nucleotides on the 3\u2032- and/or 5\u2032-side are 100% identical.",

Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. In an aspect, a pharmaceutical carrier employed can be a solid, liquid, or gas. In an aspect, examples of solid carriers can include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, tale, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. In an aspect, examples of liquid carriers can include sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. In an aspect, examples of gaseous carriers can include carbon dioxide and nitrogen. In preparing a disclosed composition for oral dosage form, any convenient pharmaceutical media can be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like can be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.",

                        "Whereas axon growth across damaged spinal cord tissue is minimal in adult mammals, zebrafish regenerate a bridge of glia and axons and recover locomotor ability. Here, a heparin binding epidermal growth factor (hb-egf) was identified to be as a secreted factor gene preferentially induced in caudal regions of spinal cord injury sites in zebrafish. Zebrafish deficient in the hb-egfa isoform had defects in ependymal cell proliferation, bridge formation, and axon regeneration, disrupting recovery from paralyzing injuries. Whereas broad transgenic hb-egfa overexpression disrupted axon regeneration and functional recovery, local delivery of human HB-EGF in engineered hydrogels accelerated these events. Epigenetic profiling for tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) revealed sequences distal to hb-egfa sufficient to activate gene expression in caudal injury sites, where its production instructs axon regeneration across the wound site. This TREE directed gene expression in spinal cord injuries in neonatal mice and increased axon regeneration in neonates as a delivery vehicle when engineered with a human HB-EGF transgene. These results identified Hb-egf as an instructive and therapeutic factor for spinal cord repair."

A midline incision was made over the thoracic vertebrae, followed by removal of the T9-T10 lamina to expose the spinal cord. The spinal cord was fully crushed for 2 see with forceps. Muscles were then sealed with 6-0 absorbable sutures and the skin was closed with wound clips. 2 mL of sterile saline was administered subcutaneously (sq) to prevent de-hydration. During recovery, mice were kept on a heating pad and received antibiotic agents (1 mg/kg gentocin) and saline daily for five days.

                                "**HB-EGF Paralogues were Induced and Required for Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury**",
                                "In an expression profiling experiment for genes induced during zebrafish spinal cord regeneration at one week post injury (wpi), both hb-egf paralogs hb-egfa and hb-egfb displayed sharp increases in RNA levels (FIG. 1A-FIG. 1C, Table 1). Hb-egf is a secreted glycoprotein that was previously implicated in M\u00fcller glial cell dedifferentiation during zebrafish retina regeneration, in experiments using antisense oligonucleotides (Want J, et al. (2012) Dev Cell. 22(2):334-347). HB-EGF has also been reported to stimulate mammalian neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth and to affect astrocyte morphology and proliferation in vitro (Jin K, et al. (2002) J Neurosci. 22(13):5365-5373; Puschmann T B, et al. (2014) J Neurochem. 128(6):878-889; Zhou Y, et al. (2010) Neurosignals. 18(3):141-151). Intracerebral HB-EGF administration also induced proliferation of neuronal precursors after cerebral ischemia in rats (Jin K, et al. (2002) J Neurosci. 22(13):5365-5373). Using in situ hybridization (ISH), hb-egfa transcripts expressed at low levels in ependymal cells of uninjured spinal cord were visualized, and then induced strongly in these cells in severed cord ends, as well as in other cells surrounding the central canal (FIG. 1B). hb-egfb expression was undetectable in uninjured spinal cord but could be detected sparsely in cells throughout the injured cord at one and 2 wpi (FIG. 1C). Expression of Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (ERBB4) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which bind Hb-egf ligands, were undetectable in uninjured sections (FIG. 6A-FIG. 6C). By one wpi, egfra receptor transcripts were detectable in cells lining the central canal (FIG. 6A), and Erbb4 protein was localized at the lesion site and throughout white and gray matter at one and 2 wpi (FIG. 6B and FIG. 6C).",
                                "To test requirements for hb-egf gene function during spinal cord regeneration, sequences contained between exon 1 and 4 of hb-egfa (allele hb-egfapd360, referred to as hb-egfaKO) were removed and sequenced contained between exons 3 and 4 of hb-egfb (allele hb-egfbpd361, referred to as hb-egfbKO) were removed using CRISPR/Cas9 methods (FIG. 1D). Animals with mutations in both hb-egf paralogues (hb-egdKO) were immediately generated and analyzed first due to an expectation of compensatory effects by gene paralogs (El-Brolosy M A, et al. (2019) Nature. 568(7751):193-197). hb-egfdKO animals showed no detectable hb-egf messages and are viable to adulthood with grossly normal swim capacity (FIG. 7A-FIG. 7C).",
                                "To evaluate effects of hb-egf mutations on spinal cord regeneration, transection injuries and a panel of histological analyses were then performed. First, 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays were performed, which indicated a \u02dc48% reduction in cycling of Sox2+ ERGs in hh-egfdKO cords as compared to wild-type clutchmates at one wpi (FIG. 1E-FIG. 1F). Next, to measure the extent of tissue bridging. hb-egfdKO and wild-type spinal cord at 4 wpi was stained for the glial marker GFAP and the axonal marker acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. The diameter of bridges was reduced by \u02dc40% in hb-egfdKO animals (FIG. 1G-FIG. 1H, Table 1, and Table 2). Table 1 shows representative spinal cord RNA-seq profiling at 1 wpi, while the complete data set resides with Applicant. Table 2 shows representative merged ATAC-seq peaks and RNA-seq genes, while the complete data set resides with Applicant. To quantify axon regeneration, a biocytin-soaked gelfoam sponge was applied rostral to the injury site at 4 wpi and assessed axon labeling caudal to the lesion. hb-egfdKO zebrafish displayed a \u02dc80% decrease in axon density compared to controls (FIG. 1I-FIG. 1J). Finally, the ability of these animals to swim against increasing velocities of water current was examined, and hb-egfdKO animals after spinal cord injury had significantly reduced swim capacity (FIG. 3K-FIG. 3L). At 4 wpi, differences between hb-egfdKO and wild-type animals in swim behavior were observed, just by viewing animals in their standard aquarium setting. Thus, Hb-egf factors were required for normal ependymal cell proliferation, tissue bridging, axon regeneration, and functional recovery after a paralyzing injury.",
                                "**HB-EGFA was Required for Spinal Cord Regeneration**",
                                "To better visualize cell types expressing hb-egf paralogs and to determine which gene (or genes) had required functions, new reporter lines and individual mutants representing each paralog were assessed (FIG. 2A-FIG. 2K, FIG. 8A-FIG. 8D). Sham-injured transgenic hh-egfa:EGFP fish (allele hb-egfa:EGFPpd362) generated with a large BAC sequence had little or no detectable EGFP expression at larval or adult stages (FIG. 8A, FIG. 2A). Upon spinal cord transection, hb-egfa-directed EGFP was induced by 1 wpi in the central canal, mimicking hb-egfa ISH patterns.",
                                "Fluorescence largely co-localized with Sox2 and GFAP, markers of ERGs and glia (FIG. 1A. FIG. 1C, and FIG. 1D). hb-egfa-directed fluorescence also marked bridging glia at 2 wpi (FIG. 8C), an observation in agreement with recent single-cells RNA-seq datasets of regenerating spinal cord, reporting hb-egfa amongst the top 5 candidates in a subpopulation of bridging glia (Klatt Shaw, et al. (2021) Dev Cell. 56(6):613-626). Many cells marked by hb-egfa:EGFP showed indicators of cell proliferation at one wpi in EdU incorporation assays (FIG. 2B). hb-egfa:EGFP largely faded by 6 wpi, a late timepoint in regeneration (FIG. 8D). The cellular localization of the hb-egfb was localized using anew EGFP knock-in allele (allele hb-egfbegfb pd363). EGFP signal was negligible in larvae or uninjured adult hb-egfbegfp spinal cord while diffuse EGFP fluorescence was observed at one and 2 wpi (FIG. 2E, FIG. 8B). As indicated by ISH, hb-egfbegfp-directed fluorescence was not well-represented in ependymal cells of the central canal or in tissue bridges composed of axons and glia (FIG. 2E-FIG. 2F).",
                                "To assess which paralog (or paralogs) has prominent functions in spinal cord regeneration, regeneration assays in hb-egfa and hb-egfb single mutants were performed (FIG. 2G). hb-egfbKO displayed similar tissue bridging and axon regeneration as wild-types after spinal cord injury. By contrast, hb-egfaKO animals had \u02dc80% and \u02dc57% reductions in tissue bridging and axon regeneration compared to wild-types, respectively (FIG. 2H-FIG. 2I). Furthermore, swim performance after spinal cord injury was reduced in hh-egfaKO animals compared to controls, and swim behavior was noticeably different from wild-types at 6 wpi in aquaria. Swim capacity in hb-egfbKO mutants was comparable to wild-types (FIG. 2J-FIG. 2K). Thus, the hb-egfa gene product was required for spinal cord regeneration.",
                                "**HB-EGFA Polarized Expression and had Instructive Effect on Axon Regeneration**",
                                "Interestingly, the assessment of hb-egfa mRNA or hb-egfa:EGFP expression in longitudinal sections of regenerating spinal cord indicated a polarized distribution, with greater signals in the caudal versus rostral ends (FIG. 1B and FIG. 3A). hb-egfa:EGFP fluorescence in both ends was quantified, and while DAPI signal was comparable, EGFP signal was \u02dc81% and \u02dc61% enriched in caudal stumps vs. rostral at one and 2 wpi, respectively. This type of quantified difference has not been reported for models of zebrafish spinal cord regeneration. To attempt to disrupt this polarized expression, transgenic fish expressing a soluble form of hb-egfa under the control of a heat-inducible promoter (hsp70:hb-egfa-2A-TBFP, allele hb-egfapd364, referred to as hb-egfaOE) was generated (FIG. 3C). Daily heat shocks led to whole-animal overexpression visualized by TBFP fluorescence, disrupting Hb-egfa rostro-caudal distribution (FIG. 3D and FIG. 9A). Animals were generated under this heat shock regimen and examined features of spinal cord regeneration. Ependymal cell cycling identified at one wpi was unaffected in these animals (FIG. 9B), and tissue bridging at 2 wpi was only mildly reduced if at all (FIG. 9C). By contrast, daily, animal-wide induction of h-egfa caused a \u02dc62% decrease in axon regeneration at 4 wpi, and recovery of swim capacity was grossly impaired (FIG. 3E-FIG. 3H). These results indicate that higher levels of Hb-egf per se do not improve regeneration and appear instead to have a disruptive effect on axon regeneration.",
                                "To assess effects of targeted Hb-egf augmentation to the lesion site alone, a slow-release strategy was tested using biomaterial depots of synthetic hydrogels made of hyaluronic acid (Gilpin A, et al. (2021) Adv Healthc Mater. 3:e2100777). The dynamics of compound release from these hydrogels was assessed by injecting a FITC-loaded version at the spinal cord lesion site and following diffusion of the dye over time. FITC gradually diffused from the injection site and faded by 21 days post injection (FIG. 10). To supplement Hb-Egf at injury sites, animals were injured and hydrogels containing either BSA or human recombinant HB-EGF (HR-HB-EGF) peptide were immediately applied (FIG. 3I). These two groups showed similar ependymal cell proliferation at one wpi (FIG. 11A-FIG. 11B). Interestingly, BSA-loaded hydrogel increased the average diameters of tissue bridges, likely by promoting extracellular cell remodeling as previously shown in mice (Hong L T A, et al. (2017) Nat Commun. 8(1):533. HR-HB-EGF administration increased this slightly further (FIG. 11C-FIG. 11D). More impressively, localized treatment with HR-HB-EGF caused a \u02dc-61% increase in axon regeneration at 4 wpi relative to vehicle (FIG. 3J-FIG. 3K). This was accompanied by a mild improvement in swim capacity, which was enhanced by the vehicle hydrogel itself compared to untreated animals, and even more so by HR-HB-EGF delivery (FIG. 3L). Together, the gain-of-function experiments indicated that Hb-egf has instructive effects on spinal cord regeneration; that is, it can modulate spinal cord regeneration when expressed ectopically. Based on its naturally polarized source in caudal cord ends, its inhibitory effects when enhanced animal wide, and its stimulatory effects particularly on axon regeneration\u2014when locally enhanced, the regulation of hb-egfa expression preferentially to the caudal stump was important for its required activity.",
                                "**An Enhancer Near HB-EGFA was Sufficient to Direct Polarized Gene Expression in Spinal Cord Injuries**",
                                "Emerging evidence indicates that regeneration programs are orchestrated by gene regulatory elements named \u201ctissue regeneration enhancer elements\u201d or TREEs in an earlier study (Kang J, et al. (2016) Nature. 532(7598):201-2006). These enhancers possess all necessary sequences to direct gene expression specifically or preferentially upon injury to the damaged area, maintain expression during regeneration, and then shut down expression as regeneration concludes. Such enhancers have been implied from profiling or validated by transgenesis in many regeneration contexts (Gehrke A R, et al. (2019) Science. 363; Goldman J A, et al. (2017) Dev Cell. 40:392-404 e395; Guenther C A, et al. (2015) Bone. 77:31-41; Harris R E, et al. (2016) Elife. 5; Harris R E, et al. (2020) Elife. 9; Thompson J D, et al. (2020) Development. 147; Vizcaya-Molina E, et al. (2018) Genome Res. 28:1852-1866; Wang W, et al. (2020) Science. 369).",
                                "To identify regulatory TREEs relevant to spinal cord regeneration, an Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), a genome-wide assay for chromatin accessibility (Buenrostro J D, et al. (2015) Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 109:21.29.1-21.29.9), was employed. Chromatin accessibility profiles were obtained from sham injured spinal cord tissue as well as tissue at one wpi (FIG. 4A-FIG. 4L and FIG. 12A-FIG. 12C). A summary of the analysis of these profiles is presented in FIG. 12A-FIG. 12C. From this assay. 5679 regions with increased chromatin accessibility and 8417 regions with reduced accessibility were identified (p<0.05) (FIG. 4A). ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets were integrated, finding 968 regions with significantly increased accessibility bioinformatically assigned to genes with increased RNA levels, indicative of candidate TREEs (FIG. 4B; Table 2 and Table 3). Interestingly, a 310 bp region located \u02dc18 kb downstream of the hb-egfa start site was identified. This 310 bp region with increased accessibility at one wpi as compared to uninjured spinal cords, referred to hereafter as hb-egfa-linked enhancer (hb-egfaEN) (i.e., DNA range=chr14:6760806-6761115) (FIG. 4C).",
                                "To test whether hb-egfaEN can direct injury induced gene expression after spinal cord injury, a region encompassing it upstream of the minimal promoter c-fos was fused to an EGFP reporter gene and stable transgenic lines (hb-egfaEN-cfos:EGFP, allele hb-egfaENpd365) were established (FIG. 4D). Transection injuries were performed and EGFP fluorescence was assessed (FIG. 4E). While spinal cord fluorescence was not detected in uninjured or injured cfos:EGFP control transgenics (allele cfos:EGFPpd366) or in uninjured hb-egfaEN-cfos:EGFP animals (FIG. 13B, FIG. 4E), hb-egfaEN directed EGFP expression was detected at spinal cord injury sites in both larval and adult zebrafish (each of 3 stable lines generated) (FIG. 4E, FIG. 13A, and FIG. 13C). hb-egfaEN-cfos:EGFP had similar spatiotemporal dynamics after spinal cord injury as those in hb-egfa:EGFP BAC transgenics (FIG. 4E-FIG. 4F, FIG. 13A, FIG. 13C). Cells activating hb-egfaEN lined the central canal at one wpi (FIG. 4E), and often showed EdU incorporation activity and expression of Sox2 (FIG. 4G-FIG. 411). Most notably, hb-egfaEN-cfos:EGFP had highly polarized localization in central canal and glial tissue comprising the caudal site of the lesion, with 410% and 190% greater fluorescence in caudal stumps at one 1 wpi and 2 wpi, respectively (FIG. 4E-FIG. 4F). To implicate transcription factors that regulate hb-egfa expression, Homer2 software was used to predict TF binding motifs surrounding and within the hb-egfa gene region. Among the most enriched sites were those predicted to be recognized by Sox2, known to be key for ERG activation and division upon injury (Ogai K, et al. (2014) Neurosci Res. 88:84-87) (FIG. 4I, Table 4). Sox2 has been reported to activate HB-EGF transcription in in vitro cancer models (Xiao W, et al. (2020) Mol Ther Oncolytics. 17:118-129), and colocalizes with many hb-egfa:EGFP-expressing cells during spinal cord regeneration as mentioned earlier (FIG. 2C). To test if hb-egfa is a direct or indirect target of Sox2, published transgenic fish enabling heat shock-inducible expression of sox2 were used (Gou Y, et al. (2018) Dev Biol. 435:84-95). sox2 inducibility was silenced in adults, as commonly seen with lines not originally filtered for adult functionality, but was potent in larvae (FIG. 14A-FIG. 14E). A single daily heat-shock from 3 to 6 dpf was sufficient to induce a 7-fold increase in sox2 mRNA levels and a 106-fold increase in hb-egfa RNA levels. Ectopic sox2 expression also elevated hb-egfa:EGFP fluorescence throughout BAC transgenic larvae (FIG. 14J-FIG. 141). These data identified a TREE linked to hb-egfa that is sufficient to direct context-dependent gene expression, and is likely to contribute at least in part to polarized hb-egfa expression during spinal cord regeneration.",

                                "Several vertebrate genomes for sequence conservation of hb-egfEN, finding significant sequence identify only in Fugu (FIG. 5A). To test for functional conservation of hb-egfaEN in mammals, an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) containing hb-egfaEN upstream of a murine minimal hsp68 promoter and an EGFP reporter gene was generated (FIG. 5B). To maximize infection of spinal cord tissue, the CC47 capsid was used to effectively transduce many or most spinal cord cell types when delivered systemically by tail vein injection to adult mice (FIG. 15A-FIG. 15C). To assess whether zebrafish hb-egfaEN can direct similar injury-induced expression in mice, 3-month-old adult mice were injected with CC47 carrying an hh-egfEN-hsp68:EGFP construct. Then, thoracic crush injuries (T9-T10 level) were performed 2 weeks after injection, and EGFP fluorescence was assessed at one wpi (FIG. 5C). Mice injected with CC47 carrying hsp68:EGFP sequences alone were used as controls (FIG. 16A). Little or no EGFP expression was observed in mice treated with either AAV preparation in sham or crush injuries, at the injury site or elsewhere (FIG. 5D, FIG. 16A-FIG. 16C).",
                                "One explanation for these findings is that hb-egfaEN sequences had changed during evolution so as to not be recognizable by mammalian transcriptional machinery. Another possibility is that gene regulatory factors that bind and are guided by these zebrafish sequences are not present or active after injury in adult murine spinal cord tissue. To address this, these same vectors were administered to neonatal mice, which were recently shown to possess some capacity to regenerate axons across a major spinal cord injury (Li Y. et al. (2020) Nature. 587(7835):613-618). First, a spinal cord crush injury was performed in P3 pups and the extent of axon growth was assessed across lesions at one and 14 dpi. Indeed, the serotonergic axons distal to the injury were overserved to show modest GFAP accumulation at the lesion site by 14 dpi, indicating similar regenerative capacity to that reported (FIG. 17A-FIG. 17C). To assess hb-egfEN activity in neonates, the CC47 vector carrying hb-egfEN-hsp68:EGFP+ or control hsp68-EGFP sequences, which effectively transduces spinal cord cell types in neonates (FIG. 15D-FIG. 15F), was systematically administered. The virus was introduced at PI, animals were subjected to crush injuries (T9-T10 level) at P3, and tissue was analyzed at two timepoints after injury (FIG. 5E, FIG. 16A-FIG. 16F). hsp68:EGFP directed occasional but minimal EGFP expression in sham or crush injuries, similar to experiments in adults (FIG. 16D-FIG. 16F). Strikingly, neonatal mice infected with hb-egfEN-hsp68:EGFP expressed EGFP in a tight, injury localized domain at 4 and 7 dpi (FIG. 5E-FIG. 5F). hb-egfEN:EGFP+ cells lined the lesion site and expressed markers characteristic of zebrafish ERGs like Sox2 and GFAP at 1 wpi, with many also positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 (FIG. 5G-FIG. 5I). Markers of neurons (HuC, FIG. 18A), macrophages (F4/80, FIG. 18B) and microglia (CC68), FIG. 18C) did not show major overlap with EGFP+ cells at 4 dpi. A subset of cells expressed the marker fibronectin (FIG. 18F). Based on these findings, the zebrafish TREE hb-egfaEN and its injury-targeting abilities can be recognized by murine transcription complexes. However, key components of this recognition, which could be chromatin features, DNA binding proteins, or other factors, are present only at early life stages and become inaccessible with age.",

                                "To test whether HB-EGF has instructive effects in mammals, a strategy harnessing hb-egfaEN was used to augment HB-EGF in the lesion sites of neonatal mice. An AAV was generated having the zebrafish hb-egfaEN upstream of an hsp68 minimal promoter and a gene cassette encoding a constitutively secreted form of human HB-EGF (CC47 hbegfaEN-hsp68:HB-EGF) (FIG. 5J). Following systemic administration of this virus or hbegfaEN-hsp68:EGFP control at P1 and thoracic crush injuries at P3 as above, the spinal cord tissue was histologically examined at P10 (FIG. 5K). Expression of human HB-EGF mRNA was concentrated at the lesion sites in mice pre-treated systemically with experimental virus, indicating targeting of the payload as expected (FIG. 5L). To determine whether this increase in localized HB-EGF had any impact on neonatal spinal cord regeneration, the density of serotonergic axons caudal to the crush site was examined at 7 dpi, as a percentage of densities rostral to the lesion. These data revealed increases in serotonergic axons crossing the lesion in hbegfaEN-hsp68-HB-EGF mice compared to controls, measured at several points within a region 1 mm from the trauma (FIG. 5M-FIG. 5N). Thus, by use of an enhancer sequence important for localizing Hb-egfa during innate regeneration of the zebrafish spinal cord, these experiments spatiotemporally augment HB-EGF to the extent that it can enhance axon regeneration after spinal cord injury in mice."

                        "Here, Hb-egfa was identified as an instructive factor for axon regeneration during functional recovery of zebrafish from a paralyzing spinal cord injury. A major crush or transection injury to a longitudinal structure like spinal cord presents a patterning challenge, to stitch back two severed ends and reestablish connections of a complex bundle of wires that grow unidirectionally. It may be expected that certain bridging and trophic signals for these events are preferentially localized with a bias toward the rostral or caudal end, while others will have no intended bias. These studies indicate that Hb-egfa has a reproducible bias for expression toward the caudal side of injuries, where its activity is required for the successful crossing of regenerating axons. Gross disruption of this bias by whole-animal overexpression impedes regeneration, versus the pro-regenerative effects of a more precise Hb-egf supplementation. Localization of stimuli or inhibitory factors in this model is fundamentally analogous to placement of mitogenic triggers in the wound epidermis of regenerating fins or limbs of fish and salamanders, or in the border zone of regenerating zebrafish hearts. Spinal cord regeneration, based on these observations, likely involves some capacity to maintain, or quickly recall and recognize, positional information that distinguishes rostral from caudal tissue domains. This property resembles positional memory, which has been studied for decades in regenerating appendages (REF).",
                        "Regeneration programs are controlled in part by TREEs. The evidence provided herein that presence of a key TREE, hb-egfEN, was a likely mechanism by which hb-egf expression is biased to caudal tissue during spinal cord regeneration. Within this short DNA sequence are presumably all motifs necessary for triggering gene expression in certain cells and at a defined time window. The hb-egfaEN contains transcription factor binding sites to distinguish rostral from caudal position. It is unclear, but of interest to clarify, whether hb-egfa gene activation is upstream in this cascade, or instead is regulated through transduction of signaling initiated by upstream factors with a biased presence.",
                        "It does not escape our attention that hb-egfaEN TREE recognition is associated with permissive, pro-regenerative environments of zebrafish and neonatal mice, but not with the scarring profile of adult mice. This stage-dependent, cross-species recognition invites speculation about broader concepts in regenerative capacity. The potential for regeneration is unlikely to be defined on its own by the ability to read and follow the instructions of a panel of key TREEs. However, it is clear from past studies that regeneration invokes a context-dependent chromatin environment, and comparisons of these environments between cell types in neonatal and adult spinal cord tissues, including their ability to recognize other TREEs, are likely to provide additional perspective.",
                        "Finally, human HB-EGF has stimulatory effects on regeneration of axons across a spinal cord crush injury in neonatal mice. It will be important to identify a more precise developmental window of these effects, as well as the influence of dose and delivery method on the extent of axon regeneration. In these experiments, although the experimental viral vector was delivered systemically, inclusion of hb-egfaEN in viral sequences was sufficient to focus HB-EGF expression to the injury site.",
                        "There are many components of this delivery system that can be optimized with the intent to alter dynamics and dose, and reduce off-target expression, including choice of AAV serotype, choice of TREE or modified TREE, modifications to payload, and use of multiple enhancers or gene cassettes per vector. With such optimization, TREE-based delivery systems have potential applications in precision interventions to enhance regenerative responses."
