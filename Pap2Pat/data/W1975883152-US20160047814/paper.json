    "title": "Vimentin 3, the New Hope, Differentiating RCC versus Oncocytoma",
    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "abstract": "Vimentin is currently used to differentiate between malignant renal carcinomas and benign oncocytomas. Recent reports showing Vimentin positive oncocytomas seriously question the validity of this present diagnostic approach. Vimentin 3 is a spliced variant and ends with a unique C-terminal ending after exon 7 which differentiates it from the full length version that has 9 exons. Therefore, the protein size is different; the full length Vimentin version has a protein size of ~57 kDa and the truncated version of ~47 kDa. We designed an antibody, called Vim3, against the unique C-terminal ending of the Vimentin 3 variant. Using immune histology, immune fluorescence, Western blot, and qRT-PCR analysis, a Vim3 overexpression was detectable exclusively in oncocytoma, making the detection of Vim3 a potential specific marker for benign kidney tumors. This antibody is the first to clearly differentiate benign oncocytoma and the mimicking eosinophilic variants of the RCCs. This differentiation between malignant and benign RCCs is essential for operative planning, follow-up therapy, and patients' survival. In the future the usage of Vimentin antibodies in routine pathology has to be applied with care. Consideration must be given to Vimentin specific binding epitopes otherwise a misdiagnosis of the patients' tumor samples may result.",

                "An oncocyte is an epithelial cell characterized by an excessive amount of mitochondria. Hamperl named them in 1931 after the Greek word \u201conkousthai\u201d (to swell) and first described them as a distinct cell system consisting of large epithelial cells with irregular nuclei and finely granular, acidophilic cytoplasm [1]. The fundamental morphological nature of oncocytes, an abundance of mitochondria, was firmly established by electron microscopy [2]. Since then oncocytes have been detected in various organs (i.e., thyroid, parathyroid, and salivary glands) as well as in different tumors (i.e., oncocytomas, H\u00fcrthle cell tumors of the thyroid, oxyphilic adenoma of parathyroid gland, and Warthin's tumor of salivary gland) (encyclopedia of Biol Chem 2004).",
                "Renal oncocytomas, initially identified by Zippel, in 1942 [3], have been regarded as predominantly benign renal neoplasms since the first study by Klein and Valensi [4], although occasional reports of malignant cases have been reported [5]. The major diagnostic problem is the differential to other renal tumors: (i) the eosinophilic or granular variant of clear cell renal carcinoma (RCC) and (ii) the chromophobe RCC. Differential diagnosis currently uses immune histology to differentiate malignant renal cell carcinoma from oncocytoma. For chromophobe carcinoma, positivity for claudin 8 and negativity for claudin 7 have been shown as the characteristic constellation [6]. To differentiate the chromophobe and eosinophilic RCC from oncocytoma, the positivity for Vimentin, a structural protein, has been used to identify the former [7]. However, a series of oncocytomas has recently been reported in which a Vimentin positivity has been observed, making the differentiation questionable, particularly in preoperative evaluation [8]. Hes et al. analyzed 234 oncocytoma of which 73% were positive for Vimentin staining [8]. Vimentin is an intermediate-sized filament that functions in cellular signal transduction, structural integrity of cells and tissues, and adhesion and migration [9]. In 2007 a spliced variant of Vimentin with a unique C-terminal ending was detected by a working group at the Craig Venter Institute (NHLBI Resequencing and Genotyping Service (RSG), N01-NV-48196, J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD 20850) and published online in PubMed (Accession number ACA06103.1). In 2011 Thakkar et al. [10] described the presence of this variant in gliomas. However, no further analysis or investigation regarding its role has been performed.",
                "Based on the knowledge that the spliced variant of Vimentin is 35 amino acids smaller than the full length variant, we compared both sequences with the detailed information of the Vimentin 3B4 antibody. From the literature it is known that the 3B4 Vimentin antibody detects the rod domain [11] which is a homologue to the truncated Vimentin variant 3 (Vim3) rod domain. Thus, it seemed possible that the protein expression of Vimentin described in the literature by immune histology resulted from the combined detection not only of the protein from full length, but also of the spliced variant of Vimentin, namely, Vim3.",
                "Most of the commercially available antibodies (clones 3B4 and SP20) are against epitopes located in the rod domain of Vimentin (Figure 1). The clone V9 is directed against the tail-domain of Vimentin. However, for the detection of the truncated Vimentin variant 3 (Vim3), the Vim3 antibody is used, which is designed against the unique C-terminal ending.",
                "In case of renal tumors with eosinophilic apperance, which mimic oncocytoma, the differential diagnosis between RCCs and oncocytomas is based on a panel of different antibodies. In particular the presence or absence of Vimentin staining of paraffinized tumor samples can be of great importance for the differentiation between malignant and benign tumors.",
                "This diagnostic approach has to be reevaluated, since a spliced Vimentin isoform exists. This is also detectable with the currently used antibodies against the N-terminal sequence; thus Vimentin positivity is no longer a diagnostic feature per se of malignant RCCs. Thus, in this paper we analyzed the presence of Vim3 versus the full length Vimentin in RCCs, especially the eosinophilic variant of RCCs versus oncocytomas.",
                "We designed primers which detect either the full length version of Vimentin or its spliced variant, Vim3. After performing a qRT-PCR on paraffin embedded tissues of the different RCCs and oncocytoma we could indeed show that Vim3 is the predominant variant in oncocytoma. Furthermore, we designed an antibody exclusively detecting the unique C-terminus of Vim3.",
                "This is the first report describing the presence and the structural differences of Vim3 versus the full length Vimentin. Our data present strong evidence that Vim3 is the isoform responsible for the so-called Vimentin positive oncocytomas described in the literature. Furthermore, we show that the V9 Vimentin antibody as well as antibodies detecting the full length version of Vimentin cannot be used any longer for differential diagnosis between RCCs and oncocytomas, because these result in misdiagnoses with potentially grave consequences for the patients involved."

                "To study the importance of Vim3 for renal tubule cells further, we analyzed Vim3 versus full length Vimentin expression by qRT-PCR in renal tumors (Figure 3). Surprisingly, while RCCs have high amounts of transcribed full length Vimentin, they are almost Vim3 negative. In contrast, the reverse is true for oncocytomas: while their negativity for full length Vimentin is not surprising (and being a criteria for their identification), the levels for Vim3 are unexpectedly high. The papillary RCC subtype (Pap) has small mRNA level of Vimentin full length and Vim3 detectable by qRT-PCR.",
                "Nevertheless, due to some posttranscriptional modifications, the Vim3 signal is not detectable by immune histology (Figure 4), while a strong Vimentin (full length) staining can be easily detected. The only positive signal, regarding the Vim3, was detectable in case of oncocytoma, and the \u201cnormal\u201d tissue section was negative for Vim3 (Figure 4).",
                "This result as well as the immune fluorescence results (Figure 5) identifies Vim3 as potential immune histology marker for renal oncocytomas.",
                "Currently, it is still common practice in routine pathology to differentiate renal cell carcinomas from carcinomas of histogenetically different origins by using immune histology with cytokeratins and Vimentin. In particular, Vimentin positivity has been regarded as the major hallmark not only for RCC but also for differentiating them from their benign counterparts, the oncocytomas. Since Hes et al. [8] reported Vimentin positivity in 73% of all tested oncocytomas, this diagnostic approach has been questionable, while its underlying mechanism has been elusive.",
                "From our results, we claim that by using an antibody against the unique C-terminal sequence of Vim3 \u201creal\u201d oncocytomas can be unequivocally identified.",
                "The exact nature and mechanism of the \u201cVimentin positive oncocytomas\u201d require further clarification. Our results indicate that these tumors have to be classified as an eosinophilic variant of clear cell RCCs. Since their morphologic appearance on an H&E slide seems identical to a \u201ctrue\u201d oncocytoma, we performed an immune fluorescence for Vim3 (Figure 5). This resulted in a clearly Vim3 negative appearance of these tumors regarded as \u201ctrue\u201d oncocytomas.",
                "However, the importance of this study for routine pathologic diagnoses with respect to the mystery of \u201cVimentin positive oncocytomas\u201d advocates our current explanation.",
                "To date, an intracellular role of Vim3 has not been defined while an intracellular role of the full length Vimentin molecule has been described in the literature as an anchoring molecule for the nucleus [16]. Knowing the interaction of its full length counterpart, one may speculate about Vim3's intracellular importance. Since the N-terminal domain and the rod domain have not changed, binding partners such as ankyrin [17] and interactions with plectin [18] should still be possible. In contrast, the missing tail and the unique amino acids of its C-terminal ending may result in differences in the C-terminal interaction. Currently, the tail-domain has been reported to be the binding and interactive site for F-actin [19] and lamin B [17]. However, since the major part of the C-terminus is absent in Vim3 and the exact interaction sites for both molecules are presently unknown, further investigations have to be conducted in order to fully elucidate potential interaction, or its absence, between Vim3 and other structural binding partners. This protein differentiates benign oncocytoma from malignant RCC variants, especially the eosinophilic RCC variant, which mimics oncocytoma by immune histology and immune fluorescence.",
                "To strengthen our interpretation, we applied the Vim3 antibody to a collision tumor (Figure 6), in which we identified its metastatic component as belonging to the papillary differentiation being Vim3 negative, while the other part was identified as an oncocytoma, based on its Vim3 positivity. CD117 expression is a hallmark in differentiating oncocytoma and chromophobe RCC [20]. In case of the examined collision tumor, CD117 positivity could be a problem, since the chromophobe RCC is a malignant tumor and the oncocytoma is a benign one, so the differentiation of the metastatic component of the collision tumor is still questionable (Figure 6). The further usage of an alpha-methyl CoA racemase (AMACR) antibody can be used as well for distinction between chromophobe RCC and oncocytoma [21]. AMACR positivity is seen in papillary RCC [22] and can be used as marker between primary and metastatic RCC [21].",
                "Figure 6 shows the two tumor types, and a clear differentiation between the RCC subtypes, namely, the papillary part of the tumor and the benign part, was possible due to the usage of our Vim3 antibody.",
                "In conclusion, we present here a unique Vimentin isoform, Vim3, as a differential marker between malignant RCCs and oncocytoma. We strongly believe that this clear differentiation between the benign and malignant kidney tumor types will be essential in the future for patients' therapy as well as operative planning, follow-up therapy, and patients' survival."
