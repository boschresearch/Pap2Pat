                        "Life on earth critically depends on iron (Fe), which plays an eminent role in a broad range of biochemical reactions including energy production, biosynthesis and replication. Although iron is one of the most abundant elements in Earth's crust, it is not bioavailable under aerobic conditions. To capture this important element from the environment, sophisticated molecular strategies using specific iron transporters (siderophores) have evolved. Microorganisms and plants can cope with the limited supply of soluble iron by sequestering multidentate iron(III)-binding agents named siderophores (1).",
                        "In light of the hundreds of known siderophore structures it is nonetheless remarkable that there is only little variation in the types of donor sites. Almost exclusively, \u03b1-hydroxy-carboxylic acids, hydroxamates, catecholates, and salicylates (FIG. 1A) are used as ligands to capture iron from the environment (1). Whereas these highly Fe-affine ligands provide an advantage in pathogenic interactions (1), iron mobilization needs to be fine-tuned among mutualists sharing ecosystems such as the rhizosphere, a complex matrix of plant roots, microbes and inorganic matter (2).",
                        "In plants iron is essential for chlorophyll production and thus correlates with plant growth and high crop yields. Root-associated bacteria may serve the host plant in providing solubilized iron, thus supporting growth and fitness in return for nutrients provided through root exudates (3).",
                        "Despite advances in understanding the mechanisms of Fe sequestering by plants, a need exists in the field of agricultural sciences for novel means that effectively provide soluble iron to plants in order to improve plant growth, stress tolerance and/or crop yields."

A further objective of the invention may be considered the provision of means for the provision of nitric oxide (NO) to plants and/or for the improved production of chlorophyll in plants.",

The inventors found that rhizosphere bacteria (Burkholderia graminis) produce a unique siderophore (gramibactin) with a dual function: its unusual N-nitroso-hydroxylamine (diazeniumdiolate) ligands efficiently bind iron and serve as nitric oxide (NO) donors.",
                        "PET-CT tracer studies and supplementation experiments revealed that maize plants take up iron from the complex, which results in a marked increase (by 50%) in chlorophyll production. In vitro assays and in vivo fluorescence imaging showed that gramibactin liberates NO, a pluripotent plant hormone mediating iron homeostasis. The findings of the invention have broader ecological and agricultural implications, since gramibactin biosynthesis genes are conserved in numerous plant-associated bacteria, including species associated with rice, maize and wheat, the top three crops worldwide.",
                        "It should be highlighted that chelating properties of N-nitroso-hydroxylamines, which are isosteric to hydroxamates, have only been previously reported for synthetic compounds, such as the copper-complexing reagent cupferron (10).

We mined the genome sequence of the maize isolate (strain C4D1M) for signature genes for siderophore biosynthesis, transporters and receptors. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster (grb) comprising associated genes coding for a TonB-dependent siderophore receptor (5) and an iron-hydroxamate transporter ATP binding protein (Table 1). Surprisingly, we discovered highly homologous, yet cryptic, gene clusters in the genomes of various related soil-borne or rhizosphere colonizing bacteria, such as Burkholderia sp. CCGE1001 (6) and CCGE1003 (6), Burkholderia sp. HB-1 (7), and Burkholderia kururiensis M130 (8), isolated from distinct locations all over the world (FIG. 1B).",
                        "A more detailed analysis of the NRPS including the substrate prediction of the adenylation domains suggested that the encoded metabolite is an N-acylated polypeptide (FIG. 1C) composed of aspartate, threonine and glycine. Intriguingly, two non-canonical amino acid moieties remained unpredictable using the commonly used algorithm. The same amino acid signature was deduced from the orphan NRPS genes of the related rhizosphere bacteria.",
                        "To detect the putative siderophore, B. graminis was cultured in a variety of media and tested for iron-chelating potency using the CAS assay. By LC-HRESIMS analysis of the culture broth extract from liquid MM9 medium, we detected two species with m/z 888.2910 [M+H]+ and m/z 835.3793 [M+H]+, for which the elemental compositions of C32H55O16N10 (calc. m/z 835.3792) and C32H52O16N10Fe (calc. m/z 888.2907) were deduced (FIG. 1D). Since the masses differed only in the mass of one equivalent of iron and three protons liberated by complexation, we concluded that the two species represented an iron-chelating compound, named gramibactin (1), and its corresponding iron complex.",
                        "To confirm that the identified gene cluster is responsible for gramibactin production, we generated an NRPS-deficient mutant by disruption of grbl by inserting a chloramphenicol resistance cassette. Cultures of B. graminis \u0394grbl showed no color change when grown on CAS agar plates, and no gramibactin could be detected in liquid culture supernatants (FIG. 1E). Thus, the grb gene locus was unequivocally linked to the production of a siderophore.",
                        "Sufficient amounts for a full structure elucidation of gramibactin were obtained from a scaled-up fermentation using an adsorber resin. Purification was achieved by repeated preparative RP-HPLC. MS fragmentation and 1 D-/2D-NMR experiments in combination with chemical degradation, derivatisation, and isotope labeling experiments revealed the cyclic lipodepsipeptide architecture of gramibactin composed of octanoic acid, glycine, D-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate and two threonine moieties (L-threo and D-allo) (see Methods). The carbon backbone of the remaining two amino acids was elucidated based on their spin systems in combination with HMBC couplings to be the same as in ornithine (Orn). However, the downfield-shifted 1H and 13C signals of the \u03b4-methylene units (\u03b4c 60.8 & 61.3 ppm; \u03b4H 4.07 & 4.09 ppm) indicated the presence of a strongly electron-withdrawing group in lieu of the \u03c9-amino moiety of Orn. According to exact mass analyses the amino acid residues are rich in nitrogen since only six out of ten nitrogen atoms are located in the peptide backbone.",
                        "To elucidate the structure of the nitrogen-rich side chain, (15NH4)2SO4 was added to a B. graminis culture, and the 15N-enriched gramibactin was isolated. 15N-HMBC experiments showed two chemically different nitrogen species in each of the Orn-like side chains, with 15N-1H couplings to H\u03b3 and H\u03b4, and H\u03b4, respectively (FIG. 1F). Characteristic losses of masses corresponding to NO in HR-MS2 fragmentations (FIG. 1G) and a positive Griess test (9) suggested that gramibactin harbors two N-nitroso moieties. The identity of the nitrosylated hydroxylamine was corroborated by typical pH-dependent shifts in the UV spectra (\u03bbmax=226 at pH 2 to \u03bbmax=248 at pH 10) and diagnostic IR bands at 1,457 cm\u22121, 1,055 cm\u22121 and 960 cm\u22121. Thus, gramibactin features an as to yet unknown amino acid, which was named graminine (Gra).",
                        "Finally, the structure of graminine was proven by total synthesis of the protected amino acid (see Methods) and comparison of 15N chemical shifts in 15N-HMBC experiments. In accordance with the in silico analysis of the NRPS domains, the absolute configuration of the graminine building blocks was determined to be D by a modified Marfey approach involving the MS-based detection of deuterium exchange in the event of epimerization during peptide hydrolysis using synthesized Cbz-L-graminine (4) as a reference (see Methods). Thus, the structure of gramibactin was fully elucidated (FIG. 1H).",
                        "N-Nitroso-hydroxylamines (or diazeniumdiolate groups) are extremely scarce in nature, with only a handful of examples out of 300,000 structures that have been reported in the literature (FIG. 4). It should be highlighted that chelating properties of N-nitroso-hydroxylamines, which are isosteric to hydroxamates, have only been reported for synthetic compounds, such as the copper-complexing reagent cupferron (10). In natural siderophores, this functional group has been fully unprecedented. To test whether the nitroso residues are directly involved in complex formation, we prepared the NMR-compatible, iron-mimicking gallium(III) complex of gramibactin. Based on complexation-induced changes of chemical shifts in the proton spectra, the beta-hydroxy carboxylic acid and both N-nitroso-hydroxylamine moieties were assigned as the ligand system providing six coordination sites. The loss of chemical equivalence of the methylene protons in the graminine side chains (FIG. 2A) can be explained by the cage-like structure of the gallium complex, which leads to a loss of flexibility in the aliphatic amino acid residue (FIG. 2B).",
                        "To evaluate the actual strength of the siderophore, we conducted potentiometric and spectrophotometric titrations to evaluate the acid/base behavior of gramibactin and to determine the complex formation constant of the iron complex (FIG. 2C). We found that gramibactin releases four protons upon metal complexation, which supports the binding model. Using the obtained pKa values it was possible to construct a speciation diagram of the stepwise deprotonated gramibactin species, revealing that both graminine residues are deprotonated at physiological pH (FIG. 2D). By a series of titrations using disodium EDTA as a competitive chelating agent we determined the log \u25a1 to be 27.6\u00b10.1, which is comparable to the power of bacterial hydroxamate siderophores (1) forming highly stable FeIII complexes over a wide range of pH (FIG. 2E). Nonetheless, gramibactin does not appear to be a typical siderophore, which is only formed under iron-limitation, as surprisingly high titers were produced independent of FeIII concentration. It thus appeared conceivable that the rhizosphere bacteria excrete the metal chelator to provide the host plant with iron.",
                        "To test whether the host plant is capable of taking up metals bound to gramibactin we performed PET/CT experiments using 68Ga as tracer nuclide, which decays into 68Zn with positron emission. As in the NMR complexation experiments, GaIII was used as a surrogate since it has comparable properties to iron in terms of complexation, yet 68Ga is easier to generate and handle than 52Fe, the only feasible positron-emitting iron isotope. This isotope would have a suitable half-life (\u02dc8h), but decays into 52Mn, which is another positron emitter that interferes with the measurement. The radiolabel was administered to hydroponically grown corn plants after replacing the nutrient solution and thoroughly washing the roots to remove phytosiderophores. After incubation with the radioactive-labeled nutrient solution the plant was subjected to PET/CT to monitor and compare uptake and spatial distribution of gallium bound to gramibactin with the uptake of unbound gallium. By LC coupled to a radio detector we evaluated the stability of the Ga-gramibactin complex at different pH values and in the nutrient solution used for administering the radioactive label to the plant. The activity was measured in the shoot following both treatments (FIG. 3B). In addition, we determined and compared standard uptake values. As these values do not differ for unbound and chelated metal, the presence of gramibactin does not impair the metal uptake of the plant.",
                        "To examine whether the plant can actually utilize Fe bound to gramibactin we performed in vivo experiments. Corn plants were grown in nutrient solutions deficient in iron, or supplementing either Fe-EDTA (positive control) or Fe-gramibactin. Solvent and metal-free chelators were used as negative controls. As readout for iron uptake we measured the chlorophyll content of youngest leaves, since chlorophyll biosynthesis is strongly dependent on iron availability (11). Leaves of plants grown only in the presence of the solvent or the metal-free ligands showed a much paler color compared to plants treated with iron-containing chelates (FIG. 3A). Quantification of extracted chlorophyll confirmed the phenotypic difference; while iron-free cultured plants contained 0.9-1.0 \u03bcg total chlorophyll per mg fresh weight of the leaf, plants supplied with the Fe chelates showed 50% higher total chlorophyll contents (1.4-1.5 \u03bcg per mg fresh weight). This dramatic difference proved that iron is effectively sequestered from gramibactin and utilized by corn plants.",
                        "Beyond Fe supply, the regulation of downstream responses to iron deficiency and overload is critical for plants. It is well known that nitric oxide is a plant hormone that mediates iron homeostasis. The structure of gramibactin strongly suggests that it could serve as an NO donor (10), as N-nitroso-hydroxylamine ligands could be capable of releasing nitric oxide upon contact with peroxidases and hydrogen peroxide (FIG. 3E) (12). Notably, these enzymes as well as reactive oxygen species are present in root tissue as they are necessary for root growth (13).",
                        "To probe the proposed enzymatic NO release in vitro, we extracted soluble proteins from ground root tissue of hydroponically grown plants into phosphate buffer. To monitor the liberation of NO in the in vitro enzyme assay, we used 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) as a reporter. Nitric oxide reacts with this chemical probe to form the 2,3-napthotriazole, and its strong fluorescence can be readily measured using a microplate reader. Extracted root proteins were incubated with the probe, hydrogen peroxide and either Fe-gramibactin or the iron-free ligand, using heat-inactivated proteins as negative control. A drastically increased fluorescence was only observed in the sample supplemented with gramibactin (FIG. 3C). Thus, gramibactin represents a novel NO donor. Interestingly, it appears that iron coordination stabilizes the N-nitroso-hydroxylamine by impairing the abstraction of an electron from the oxygen, which would be necessary for the oxidation and subsequent decay under nitric oxide release. As our in vivo experiments unequivocally showed the Fe-gramibactin complex is dissociated in the plant, which would provide the free ligands for NO liberation.",
                        "To verify the postulated NO release in planta we treated fresh corn seedlings with diaminofluoresceine-2-diacetate (DAF-2DA), a cell-permeable probe that captures NO with formation of a highly fluorescent triazole. After loading maize roots with the chemical probe they were incubated with negative controls, gramibactin, or Fe-gramibactin, then cut and inspected by fluorescence microscopy. Whereas no fluorescence could be detected in the control sample treated with the probe only, a strong signal was observed in the root treated with gramibactin (FIG. 3D). Thus, NO is in fact liberated from gramibactin in the plant tissue. A weak signal was also detectable in the root treated with the Fe-gramibactin complex. This finding is important as it confirms that iron is removed from gramibactin in vivo, thus providing free ligands that can subsequently release nitric oxide. Finally, fluorescence microscopy also allowed localizing NO, which is apparently released into the intracellular space. This observation is plausible as peroxidases, which are required for NO release, are typically located in the cell membrane.",
                        "Plants have been known to acquire iron via two main avenues, reductases and phytosiderophores (11, 14). However, recent work suggested that bacteria could play a key role in the rhizosphere as their siderophores may solubilize iron and make it accessible to the plant (3). It has been shown that the plant Fe status may affect the composition of siderophore-secreting microorganisms in the rhizosphere (15) and that uptake and translocation of iron in plants can be modulated by interacting microorganisms (3, 16). Although bacterial siderophores have been reported to extract iron from plant-derived organic matter (17), experiments with hydroponic cultures demonstrated that beyond Fe-EDTA, several bacterial and fungal Fe-siderophore complexes may represent viable sources of Fe for a variety of plants (18-21). Whereas these previous studies were limited to non-natural host-siderophore combinations, this study indicates that a siderophore of rhizosphere bacteria has a beneficial effect on the receiving crop plant. Surprisingly, this interdomain-acting molecule represents a novel type of siderophore featuring novel N-nitroso ligands for the complexation of iron. The rare N-nitroso-hydroxylamine moiety is thus an important addition to the known Fe-binding motifs in naturally occurring iron chelators and may inspire the design of related functional molecules.",
                        "The most unexpected finding is, however, that the iron-binding ligands have a second function as NO donor. The release of nitric oxide by a metabolite from rhizosphere bacteria is significant since NO represents an important plant hormone regulating many different functions in the plant, including growth, defense mechanisms and formation of symbioses (22-24). In the context of siderophores it is particularly noteworthy that NO also plays a key role in iron homeostasis and improves internal iron availability, likely by crosstalk with ferritin and frataxin, and formation of iron-nitrosyl complexes (25-28).",
                        "Our results also indicate that similar NO-donating siderophores are widespread in the plant environment, since orthologous gene clusters are shared among rhizosphere bacteria that are associated with graminaceous crop plants (4, 8) as well as with nodule-forming legumes (6). In this context it is noteworthy that exogenously supplied, synthetic NO-donors (29) were found to increase plant fitness, root growth and tolerance towards stress (30, 31). Administering siderophores on plants, on the other hand, may be an approach to control pathogens (32, 33) and to mobilize and supply iron to the crop plants (34). Thus, the discovery of a novel bifunctional siderophore-NO-donor is not only intriguing from a chemical perspective but also points to an important ecological role. Thus, gramibactin or producer strains may find application in agriculture (35)."

                                "The absolute configuration of gramibactin was elucidated by Marfey's method (8) using Marfey's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4.dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide, I-FDAA). d,l-Threo-b-hydroxyaspartic acid was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The elution order has been shown to be d\u2192l. (9) Cbz-l-graminine (4) was prepared as described above. 0.47 mg gramibactin (0.56 \u03bcmol) were hydrolyzed in 7 n HClaq or 7 n DCI in D20 at 105\u00b0 C. for 19 h. After lyophilization the sample was resuspended in ddH2O (50 \u03bcL) and 1 m NaHCO3 (10 \u03bcL). Marfey's reagent (10 \u03bcL, 10 mg mL\u22121 in acetone) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 40\u00b0 C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 1 n HCl (10 \u03bcL). The reaction mixture was then diluted with ddH2O (150 \u03bcL) and analyzed by analytical HPLC. The reference compounds were derivatized in the same way but were hydrolyzed with HCl only. For analytical HPLC analysis, a Cosmosil 120-5 C18-MS column (250\u00d74.6 mm, Nicalai Tesque) with an elution gradient [solvent A: H2O+0.1% TFA, solvent B: MeCN, gradient 20% B to 30% B over 30 min, flow rate: 1 mL min\u22121] was used.",
                                "Elucidating the absolute configuration of graminine was not feasible by the typical Marfey approach; hydrolysis of the reference compound and subsequent derivatization with Marfey's reagent led to two different diastereomers, which indicated a facile epimerization during hydrolysis. Using an approach based on MS rather than UV detection we succeeded in assigning the derivatives of the d- and l-enantiomers. Therefore, gramibactin and Cbz-l-graminine were hydrolyzed in DCl/D2O. When epimerization takes place, the proton in a-position is exchanged by deuterium. The resulting derivatization product would then be one mass unit heavier than of the original one. (10) Thus we were able to assign the absolute configuration of both graminine building blocks in gramibactin as d (FIG. 10A), since experiments with the synthetic reference showed that the derivative of the l-enantiomer elutes earlier.",
                                "To elucidate the absolute configurations of the elucidated amino acids, Marfey's method was employed. (8) The configuration of b-hydroxy-aspartate was identified as d-threo and those of the threonine residues as l-threo and d-allo, although their positions remained unclear. Since d-allo threonine would be the epimerization product of 1-threonine, 1-threonine-2,3-d2 was administered to B. graminis cultures. Deuterium-enriched gramibactin was isolated, and COSY experiments were conducted. While the signal of the amide proton in threonine 2 was unchanged, it was detected as an overlap of a singlet with the normal doublet in threonine 1 (FIG. 7B). The singlet is caused by the presence of deuterium at the a-carbon and a coupling constant that is too low to be properly resolved. In addition, both threonines show a distorted methyl signal in the 1H spectrum due to deuterium in b-position, indicating that the deuterated threonine is incorporated in both positions. The loss of the deuterium marker in threonine 2 is therefore the product of an epimerization and deuterium-proton exchange. Based on these findings we concluded that threonine 1 has an 1-threo configuration, whereas threonine 2 is d-allo configured. This assignment was confirmed by partial hydrolysis and Marfey's analysis on the isolated gramibactin fragments.",

At the second equivalence point, the curve shows a much flatter slope than at the other two inflection points. This can be explained by a buffering effect of the two N-nitroso-hydroxylamine moieties. The last inflection point marks the complete deprotonation of these two moieties. Analysis of the titration curves for the system gramibactin:Fe3+ shows the existence of a considerable drop in pH at very acidic pH, as compared with that of the ligand, thus indicating high affinity of the ligand for this metal ion and measurable complexation already at very low pH. The only visible inflection point in this titration curve appears after the addition of four equivalents KOH. The release of four protons upon metal complexation also fits to our proposed metal binding model.",
