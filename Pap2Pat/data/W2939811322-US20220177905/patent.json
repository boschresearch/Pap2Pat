    "abstract": "An active genetic approach to preferentially transmit allelic variants (allelic-drive) resulting from only a single or a few nucleotide alterations. Embodiments are provided for allelic-drive: one, copy-cutting, in which a non-preferred allele is selectively targeted for Cas9/guide RNA (gRNA) cleavage, and a more general approach, copy-grafting, that permits selective inheritance of a desired allele located at some distance from the gRNA cut site. A lethal mosaicism is provided that dominantly eliminates NHEJ-induced mutations and favors inheritance of functional cleavage-resistant alleles. These two efficient allelic-drive methods, enhanced by lethal mosaicism and a trans-generational drive process provide a shadow-drive, that are applicable to improvements in health and agriculture.",

Many desired genetic traits (e.g., drought tolerance in plants, crop yield, pest-resistance, or insecticide sensitivity), however, result from allelic variants altering only one or a few base pairs. An efficient system for super-Mendelian inheritance of such subtle genetic variants would accelerate a wide array of efforts to disseminate favorable traits throughout populations, or to assemble complex genotypes consisting of point-mutant alleles in combination with insertional transgenes for a multitude of research and applied purposes.",

In embodiments, the invention provides methods and compositions to repair a cleavage sensitive allele with sequences provided by a cut-resistant allele present on the companion chromosome. This type of allelic-drive can supplement a gene-drive system that copies itself in one genomic location, by adding a second guide RNA (gRNA) to the gene-drive cassette that directs selective cleavage of a non-preferred allele at a separate genomic site. Such a dual gRNA drive system (e.g., FIGS. 1A-1B) results in efficient super-Mendelian inheritance of both to the gene-drive element and the beneficial allelic variant via germline transmission when carrier individuals mate with recipient individuals bearing the undesired cleavage-sensitive allele.",
                        "The invention provides at least two forms of allelic drive. The first, copy-cutting involves a Cas9-gRNA complex selectively cutting one allelic variant, followed by HDR-mediated repair and replacement with a non-cleavable allele of the same gene provided in-trans. The second and more generally applicable form of allelic-drive, copy-grafting, involves copying a short genomic interval that encompasses a favored allele in proximity to a gRNA cut site. In the case of copy-grafting, the favored allele is associated with neighboring sequences resistant to gRNA cleavage.",
                        "The invention further provides a technique referred to as lethal-mosaicism, that dominantly eliminates NHEJ-induced mutations and favors inheritance of functional cleavage-resistant alleles. The basis for lethal mosaicism is that mutant alleles produced by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in an essential gene become dominantly lethal during the drive process. In contrast, a protected non-cleavable functional allele of the gene, remains immune to such lethal mosaicism. Thus, lethal mosaicism results in selective elimination of undesired alleles generated by NHEJ.",

To further illustrate, a linker optionally attaches a label (e.g., a fluorescent dye, a radioisotope, etc.) to an oligonucleotide probe, a primer nucleic acid, or the like. Linkers are typically at least bifunctional chemical moieties and in certain embodiments, they comprise cleavable attachments, which can be cleaved by, e.g., heat, an enzyme, a chemical agent, electromagnetic radiation, etc. to release materials or compounds from, e.g., a solid support. A careful choice of linker allows cleavage to be performed under appropriate conditions compatible with the stability of the compound and assay method. Generally a linker has no specific biological activity other than to, e.g., join chemical species together or to preserve some minimum distance or other spatial relationship between such species.

The eukaryotic cells may be those of or derived from a particular organism, such as a mammal, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, or non-human primate. In general, codon optimization refers to a process of modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the host cell of interest by replacing at least one codon (e.g., about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more than 50 codons) of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host cell while maintaining the native amino acid sequence. Various species may exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. Codon bias (differences in codon usage between organisms) may correlate with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which may depend on, among other things, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. In some embodiments, one or more codons (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, more than 50, or all codons) in a sequence encoding an endonuclease correspond to the most frequently used codon for a particular amino acid.

                        "For instance, the invention can suppress crop pests actively attacking a crop of interest or be used for weed control. This strategy closely parallels that illustrated above for combating malaria. For example, the spotted wing fly (Drosophila suzukii), which is related to the laboratory fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), may be targeted. D. suzukii entered the U.S. in 2008 and in 2010 was estimated to cause over $500 million of damage is to soft fruits (strawberries, other berries, grapes, cherries) in Pacific coast states, amounting to nearly 20% of this $2.5 billion industry. The genome sequence of D. suzukii has been determined, and constructs described herein can be generated to test for control and eradication of this invasive pest. Other pests that may also be targeted include, but are not limited to, the Medfly (\u2248$1.2 billion damage/yr), olive fly (can reduce oil production by as much as 80%), pea leaf miner (a fly causing over $1.5 billion of crop damage), and Asian tiger mosquito (a vector for encephalitis, dengue fever, yellow fever and dog heartworm). Pests or weeds that are resistant to pesticides or herbicides (e.g., glyphosate), respectively, may also be targeted by the invention.

Loss-of-function N\u2212 mutations, which are non-viable when homozygous in females (or hemizygous in males), produce dominant wing margin notching and thickened veins phenotypes in heterozygous females (FIG. 1C, black arrows), while homozygous viable dominant gain-of-function alleles, designated as Abruptex (NAx, denoted as N* in the figures) generate a contrasting vein-loss phenotype (FIG. 1C, gray arrows).",

Cas9 is provided in trans. FIG. 1B shows a DNA sequence of the gRNA-N+ target site on the sensitive wild-type Notch allele (N+S), and the cleavage-insensitive NAx16 allele (N*IS) is highlighted in dark gray, and PAM site in light gray.

Note that six de novo NHEJ induced Abruptex alleles (including NAx11 and NAx103) delete one amino acid, the NAx26 allele results in the insertion of a single Tyr residue, and the NAx3 allele results in the insertion of two amino-acids (Thr-Ser). NHEJ-induced N\u2212 mutations cause deletions ranging from two to six amino-acids.",
                                "A gRNA (gRNA-N+) anchored by this PAM site was designed to direct cleavage of the wild-type N+ allele, but not the NAx16 allele (FIGS. 1A-1B). The gRNA-N+ was incorporated into a DsRed-marked gRNA-only \u201cCopyCat\u201d element (ccN) designed to insert into, and copy itself, at the closely linked yellow locus, which is located 2 centimorgans distal to Notch relative to the centromere (FIG. 1A, FIG. 8B). Since genomic insertion of the ccN CopyCat element disrupts the function of the yellow locus this allele is denoted as y<ccN> (see Methods for full allele nomenclature). lt was hypothesized that in the presence of an unlinked source of Cas9, this DsRed marked y<ccN> CopyCat element would copy itself at the yellow locus and might also result in Super-Mendelian inheritance of the gRNA-insensitive NAx16 allele via copy-cutting.",
                                "Whether the y<ccN> allele would efficiently copy itself, as well as the neighboring uncleavable NAx16 allele, onto a wild-type (y+ N+) X-chromosome (FIG. 1A) when combined with an autosomal source of Cas9 provided in-trans (FIG. 1D) was tested. F0 females (\u2640) bearing the y<ccN> and NAx16 alleles were crossed to wild-type males (\u2642) homozygous for a Cas9 source on the third chromosome to generate F1 y<ccN> NAx16/++; Cas9/+ \u2640 progeny, hereafter referred to as \u201cmaster females\u201d (abbreviated MF in figures)\u201d. In parallel, F0 were crossed to w\u2212 \u2642 (lacking Cas9), to generate control F1 females (y<ccN> NAx16/++; +/+ \u2640), which were used to assess baseline Mendelian inheritance in the absence of Cas9-mediated drive. F1 master females (and control females) were crossed to wild-type (y+ N+) \u2642 carrying a normal X-chromosome (or the multiply inverted FM7 balancer chromosome, which suppresses recombination, FIG. 1D). The resulting F2 progeny were then scored both for transmission of the DsRed-marked y<ccN> element and the NAx16 allele.",
                                "Transmission percentages for the y<ccN> (DsRed+) and dominant NAx16 alleles in F2 \u2642 revealed highly biased inheritance of both alleles wherein 85.3% of these progeny were DsRed+ and yet a higher percentage (93.6%) were NAx16 (FIG. 1E). Since loss-of-function null N\u2212 alleles are non-viable in males, which carry only a single X chromosome, F2 \u2642 were either NAx16 or N+. Evidence that such lethal N\u2212 alleles were indeed being generated as a result of imprecise DNA repair mediated by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is provided below. Additionally, consistent with the observation that nearly all F2 \u2642 displayed a yellow\u2212 mutant phenotype, sequence analysis of individuals from non-DsRed lines revealed that they all carried NHEJ-induced loss-of function mutations (FIG. 1D, FIG. 6).",

DNA was isolated from y- DsRed-isogenic lines described in Table 2 and sequenced for NHEJ-induced mutations at the gRNA-y1 cleavage site. DNA sequences of several such alleles are presented, with in-frame y\u2212 alleles highlighted.",
                                "Super-Mendelian inheritance of the DsRed marked y<ccN> element in F2 \u2640 progeny (72.4%) was observed. However, Notch-related phenotypes can not be scored with certainty due to a high degree of mosaicism in which wings often displayed a mixture of wild-type, gain-, and loss-of-function phenotypes (FIG. 7). Such somatic mosaicism most likely results from the maternal perdurance of Cas9-gRNA complexes deposited into the egg, even in animals that did not inherit the Cas9-GFP transgene3,5,12,13.",
                                "Specifically, FIG. 7 Shows mosaic phenotypes of F2 female progeny of master females. Examples of mosaic wing phenotypes observed in female F2 progeny of master females are depicted in FIG. 1D. Note the combination of phenotypes typical of Notch loss-of-function alleles consisting of wing margin notches and thickened veins (black arrows) and gain-of-function Abruptex alleles typified by distal vein truncations or gaps, which are particularly prominent in the L4 and L5 veins (gray arrows).",
                                "In order to circumvent this difficulty in scoring Notch phenotypes in F2 \u2640, 104 individual lines derived from single F2 females (selected for absence of the Cas9-GFP transgene) were established, thus permitting unambiguous scoring of N phenotypes in subsequent generations (FIG. 1D). DNA was prepared from each isogenic line and PCR products from the Notch locus were sequenced to determine what alterations, if any, were present at the Notch-gRNA cleavage site (Table 2 and Table 3). DNA sequence polymorphisms located in an intron adjacent to the NAx16 mutation (6.5 Kb upstream of the NAx16 mutation) were identified that unambiguously distinguished the donor y<ccN> NAx16 bearing chromosome from the recipient chromosome (FIG. 8A). Results of the phenotypic and molecular analysis of the individual F2 \u2640 lines are summarized in FIG. 1D (see Table 2 and Table 3 for extensive analysis and sequence data). Overall, these findings parallel those for F2 \u2642 because super-Mendelian transmission of the DsRed marked y<ccN> element (75%) and yet greater inheritance of the NAx16 allele (87.5%) among the female founder lines was observed (FIG. 1D). Also, no N\u2212 alleles were recovered, which in this case was surprising as such loss-of-function alleles generated by NHEJ would be expected to be viable in a heterozygous condition (see explanation below).",
                                "An important feature of the analysis of gRNA-induced events in the individual F2 \u2640 lines was the ability to assign specific copying or non-copying events at the Notch locus to donor versus receiver chromosomes. In order to achieve the same end while analyzing larger numbers of progeny, the donor chromosome was marked with the tightly linked white-apricot (w3) allele (0.5 centimorgans from Notch, FIG. 8B), which causes an orange eye phenotype (i.e., y<ccN> w3 NAx16). F1 master females (y<ccN> w3 NAx16/y+ w\u2212 N+; Cas9/+) were crossed to w\u2212 males (FIGS. 8A-8B), and the resulting F2 individuals could be scored with \u02dc99.5% precision for inheritance of donor (w3) versus receiver (w\u2212) chromosomes.",

FIG. 8A shows molecular markers; Notch intron DNA sequence polymorphisms used to score donor (A\u2192T) versus receiver (6 nt deletion) chromosomes. FIG. 8B shows genetic markers: Alleles of the white locus, which is closely linked to Notch (0.5 centimorgans) were used to distinguish individuals carrying donor (w2=orange eyes) from receiver (w\u2212=white eyes) chromosomes.",
                                "Compiled results from \u02dc20 such crosses conducted in parallel (FIG. 1F) reveal the same overall trend regarding the conversion frequencies observed in the F2 \u2640 lines (FIG. 1D), with allelic conversion rates of N+ to NAx16 averaging to 79.5%, a rate approximately a third higher than for copying of the y<ccN> CopyCat element (\u02dc60%). This is particularly notable given that gRNA-induced cleavage events at the yellow locus (100% in this invention\u2014FIG. 6\u2014) were consistently greater than at the Notch site, where 8-10% of progeny typically retained an unaltered wild-type target sequence (FIG. 1D, Table 2, and FIG. 9B).",

Note that out of 35 such alleles sequenced (derived from isogenic females plus additional independently generated wild-type alleles): 28 matched that of the original receiver chromosome, 6 independent mutations were recovered in with a C\u2192A mutation at the \u22124 position relative to the PAM sequence (e.g., immediately 5\u2032 to the gRNA cut site (indicated by dashed vertical line), and one compound mutant with a C\u2192A mutation at the \u22124 position and CA\u2192GC alterations at the \u22122, \u22123 positions. FIG. 9C shows NHEJ-induced Abruptex alleles. The TCC deletion at position \u22122 \u22121 +1 was recovered 6 independent times, while two other Ax mutations were recovered only once.",

In contrast, among control crosses (for which no source of Cas9 was introduced), a greater proportion of male progeny inherited the wild-type (receiver) chromosome than the NAx16 donor chromosome, presumably reflecting a fitness cost associated with the NAx16 allele (FIG. 2A, light grey circles).",

FIG. 2B shows overnight embryo collections stained with an antibody against the pan-neural Elav protein.

FIG. 2D shows on the top panel: Sequence of a cleavage-insensitive N+ allele (N+IS).

                                "One explanation for the pronounced Cas9-induced reciprocal inheritance bias of the NAx16 donor allele, is that a fraction of gRNA-N+ induced cleavage events at the Notch locus on the receiver chromosome may result in NHEJ-induced N\u2212 loss-of-function alleles. In males, such alleles would be hemizygous lethal resulting in strong embryonic neurogenic phenotypes causing much of the ventral epidermis to differentiate inappropriately as nervous system14. To test this, embryos from F1 master females (y>ccN> NAX16/++; Cas9/+ \u2640) were collected and crossed to wild-type \u2642. An abundant class of mutants (\u02dc20%) with strong neurogenic phenotypes (FIGS. 2B-2C) was observed. As expected, neurogenic mutant embryos were absent from control crosses (i.e., from F1 y>ccN> NAx16/++ \u2640, FIG. 2C).",
                                "**Dominant Elimination of Lethal NHEJ Alleles**",
                                "While the above results provide strong evidence for Cas9-dependent generation of N\u2212 alleles in the progeny of F1 master females, they do not readily account for the failure to recover any heterozygous N\u2212 alleles among the isogenic F2 \u2640 lines. One possibility is that if F2 \u2640 progeny derived from F1 master females inherit a N\u2212 allele from their mothers, the \u201cwild-type\u201d paternal allele might be acted on in a mosaic fashion by maternally perduring Cas9-gRNA complexes3,5,12,13. Such a maternal effect could result in a large enough proportion of somatic cells having two mutant copies of the Notch gene to preclude viability in trans-heterozygotes. This hypothetical mechanism, hereinafter referred to as lethal mosaicism, is consistent with the high frequency of mosaic wing phenotypes in F2 \u2640 females as observed in this invention (FIG. 7). One prediction of the lethal mosaic hypothesis is that if F1 master females were crossed to males carrying the non-cleavable NAx16 allele instead of wild-type males, the observed fraction of N\u2212 F2 embryos should decrease significantly as a result of rescued lethality in females. This was indeed the case (FIG. 2C).",
                                "Another avenue for testing the lethal mosaicism hypothesis was provided by sequencing single F2 \u2640 lines that inherited phenotypically wild-type N+ alleles (FIGS. 9B, 10). This analysis revealed that while most of these \u201cwild-type\u201d N+ alleles matched the original native allele, one had point mutations in the gRNA core sequence (i.e., between 1-4 nucleotides from the PAM site). Such mutations would be predicted to result in cleavage resistant or \u201cinsensitive\u201d (N+IS) alleles (see FIG. 2D for sequence of specific N+IS allele used below). As in the case of crossing master F1 females to NAx16 \u2642, it was expected that crossing them to N+IS \u2642 (FIG. 2D) would also protect heterozygous female F2 progeny from lethal mosaicism since such individuals would carry one cleavage resistant functional N+ allele. The advantage of using N+IS over NAx16 fathers for such experiments is that N+/N+IS \u2640 heterozygotes are fully viable, whereas N\u2212/NAx16 \u2640 exhibit significantly reduced viability. As predicted by the lethal mosaic hypothesis, a significant percentage (average=22%; p<0.0001 unpaired parametric t-test analysis) of F2 females derived from crosses of F1 master females to N+IS \u2642 displayed a typical heterozygous N\u2212/+ wing phenotype in a Cas9-dependent fashion (FIG. 2D). Sequencing of several of such N\u2212 alleles from individual F2 females revealed an array of DNA alterations centered at the cut site consisting of frameshifts, amino acid substitutions, and deletions (FIG. 9A, 10). In addition, consistent with the embryo studies described above, from which it was inferred that F2 females can be rescued from mosaic lethality by carrying a cleavage-insensitive Notch allele (FIG. 2C), a 20% excess of females to males (p<0.0001 unpaired parametric t-test analysis) among adult F2 progeny derived from crosses of master females to N+IS \u2642 was observed, which was not evident in parallel crosses to wild-type \u2642 bearing the sensitive N+ allele (FIG. 11).",
                                "Specifically, FIG. 11 shows rescuing lethal mosaicism in female F2 progeny skews the fraction of receiver chromosomes recovered in males. Male and female F2 recipients of the receiver chromosome were recovered at approximately equal frequencies when fathers provided a N+ sensitive allele (N+S). In contrast, when fathers provided a N+ insensitive allele (N+IS), which protects female offspring from lethal mosaicism, a strong skewing against males was observed among F2 progeny inheriting a receiver chromosome. This is additional evidence for lethal mosaicism in F2 females, in which the paternal N allele determines lethality (N+S), or survival (N+IS) of the heterozygous female offspring.",
                                "An additional prediction of the lethal-mosaic hypothesis is that progeny inheriting the ccN drive element and any NHEJ-induced N\u2212 allele from their mothers should be inviable if they also carried a zygotic source of vasa-Cas9. This was tested by establishing three different lines in which NHEJ induced N\u2212 alleles (N\u221217, N\u221220, and N\u221221\u2014FIGS. 9A-9C) were associated with the ccN element. When such F0 females (y<ccN> N\u2212/Balancer) were crossed to homozygous Cas9 males (FIG. 2E), the only viable female F1 adult progeny recovered carried the N+ balancer (BAL) chromosome (FIG. 2E). The absence of emerging N\u2212 F1 females in the Cas9 crosses contrasts with the expected 50% Mendelian transmission rate observed in non Cas9 control crosses. These experiments demonstrate that NHEJ-induced N\u2212 alleles, such as those created in the germline of master females, cannot be transmitted to the next generation in the presence of Cas9 since they produce fully penetrant dominant lethality in heterozygous animals carrying the ccN element.",
                                "As a yet more stringent test of the lethal mosaic hypothesis, both males and females carrying the ccN element combined with a wild-type cleavage sensitive N+ allele (N+S) were separately crossed to flies carrying the vasa-Cas9 transgene. Again, no surviving F1 progeny inherited the y<ccN> allele (FIGS. 12A-12B).",

Right panel: no viable female progeny were recovered from this cross (circles with red outlines), while male progeny that do not inherit the ccN element were recovered in similar numbers as in control crosses (circles with black outlines).

                                "Lethal mosaicism is a highly potent process that eliminates all progeny carrying the y<ccN> allele, a hemizygous or homozygous cleavage-sensitive Notch allele, and a vasa-Cas9 source (either maternally or paternally provided). Moreover, progeny maintaining an association between the y<ccN> and NAx alleles (or the very rarely generated N+IS cleavage insensitive alleles) can survive in the presence of Cas9.",
                                "The observation of pervasive somatic and lethal mosaicism in crosses of F1 master females to wild-type males raised the possibility that maternally inherited Cas9-gRNA complexes in F2 \u2640 might also persist and act in the germline to generate some degree of gene-drive or allelic-drive in the F3 generation, even in animals that did not inherit the Cas9 transgene. This was tested by crossing F2 y<ccN> NAx16/++; +/+ (non-Cas9) \u2640 to N+IS \u2642 (FIG. 3A).",

FIG. 3B shows a percent of F3 progeny demonstrating features of drive including (from left to right): percent of receiver chromosomes converted to NAx16 allele (N+, blue circles; presence or absence of Cas9 refers to F1 generation); percent of heterozygous N\u2212/+ females (N\u2212, black circles\u2014clustered around 12%); and percent of individuals having copied DsRed marked y<ccN> element to receiver chromosomes in either males or females (red circles-clustered around 29.3% and 31.8%). The low percentages shown in control crosses (grey circles), in which F1 females lacked source of Cas9, presumably reflect the low rates of recombination between w2 and NAx16 (0.5 cm) or the y<ccN> element (1.5 cm).

                                "One surprise emerging from analysis of the copying efficiency of the y<ccN> CopyCat element versus the NAx16 allele, which was also a striking trend in the 104 single female lines (FIG. 1D), was an unexpected high positive correlation between these two conversion events. In nearly all cases where the CopyCat element was copied to a receiver chromosome, so too was the NAx16 allele. This co-drive phenomenon can be most readily appreciated by considering the fraction of NAx16 conversion events among DsRed+ (y<ccN>) receiver chromosomes (92.2%), which is a frequency nearly double that of NAx16 conversion among receiving chromosomes that failed to copy the y<ccN> element (51.6%) (FIG. 3C). Similarly, among the single F2 female lines, 96% of the receiver chromosomes carrying the DsRed+ y<ccN> element also copied the NAx16 allele, in contrast to only 38% of progeny having copied the NAx16 allele to a receiver chromosomes in the absence of y<ccN> copying (FIG. 1D). Whether this co-drive phenomenon depended on chromosome pairing by placing the yccN> NAx16 chromosome in-trans to a multiply inverted balancer X chromosome (Basc) was examined. This chromosomal arrangement resulted in a loss of co-drive as well as a marked reduction in the frequency of NAx16 copying (FIG. 3D). It is notable that the frequency of DsRed copying in these crosses was only slightly reduced relative to that observed with a wild-type receiver chromosome, consistent with the tip of the Basc chromosome, which includes the yellow locus, being co-linear with wild-type chromosomes (note: the Basc IB3 inversion breakpoint is located to between y and N). Whether co-drive of the NAx16 allele depended on active copying at the yellow locus by placing the y<ccN> NAx16 chromosome in-trans to a receiver chromosome carrying an NHEJ induced point mutation at the y-gRNA cleavage site was also tested. In this \u201csingle cut\u201d configuration, reduced transmission of the NAx16 allele relative to that in control crosses using a wild-type (y+N+) receiver chromosome was observed (FIGS. 13A-13B). This latter experiment indicates that copying the y<ccN> element increases allelic-drive at the N locus.",
                                "Specifically, FIGS. 13A-13B show that allelic conversion at the Notch locus is reduced when copying of the ccN element at yellow is blocked. FIG. 13A is a crossing scheme. Top (double conversion\u2014see results presented in FIG. 1F): control copying of both the DsRed (DR) marked y<ccN> and Ax (N*) alleles, which leads to co-drive and high level copying of the Ax allele (97.3% in this experiment\u2014panel b); Bottom (single conversion\u2014see results in panel b): copying of the DsRed marked ccN element is blocked by a cleavage insensitive NHEJ allele at the y-gRNA cut site leading to no drive of that element and reduced drive of the Ax allele (panel b). FIG. 13B shows conversion percentages for double and single conversion schemes showing complete inhibition of ccN element copying by the y\u2212 NHEJ allele at the y-gRNA cut site and reduced (86.4%) copying of the Ax allele relative to that in control double conversion crosses (97.3%). Note that the observed levels of conversion for both the ccN element and Ax16 allele in control double conversion crosses were higher than in previous experiments, which may reflect the fact that an additional generation was required to generate master females for these crosses, which perhaps reduced the effect of suppressor mutations limiting Cas9 expression/activity. Such suppressors often accumulate in stocks over time.",
                                "Finally, the impact of cis- versus trans-configurations for the y<ccN> and NAx16 alleles was examined by generating master females of the genotype y<ccN> N+S/y+ NAx16; Cas9/+ (FIGS. 14A-14B) and efficient drive of both the DsRed marked y<ccN> element (76% conversion) and the NAx16 allele (93% conversion) was observed indicating that both cis- and trans-configurations of the two elements sustain potent drive.",
                                "Specifically, FIGS. 14A-14B show efficient allelic drive is observed when the NAx16 allele is in a trans-configuration relative to the y<ccN> allele. FIG. 14A shows crossing schemes depicting the standard cis-conversion drive (top\u2014see results presented in FIG. 1F) and trans-configuration drive (panel b) wherein the DsRed marked ccN element is linked to the w\u2212 and N+S alleles, and the NAx16 allele is on a y+ w2 chromosome. FIG. 14B shows percentages of bi-directional conversion rates (e.g., DsRed w2 or Ax w\u2212). Both trans-copying events occur with high efficiency.",
                                "While copying of the Ax16 allele from the donor to the receiver chromosome was the overwhelmingly prevalent event in the above allelic drive experiments, rare in-frame NHEJ-induced indels induced at the gRNA-N+ cut-site that generated de-novo Abruptex alleles were also identified (FIGS. 9C, 10). Whether it was possible to produce allelic drive with one such de-novo allele (Ax103) by recombining NAx103 with the y<ccN> element was tested. It performed equivalently to the NAx16 allele in driving conversion of a wild-type N+ allele to an Abruptex phenotype (FIG. 15). This finding demonstrates that allelic variants mutating residues at the Cas9 cleavage site are equally well-suited as those disrupting a PAM site for sustaining efficient allelic drive. Specifically, FIG. 15 shows efficient allelic drive of the de novo cleavage site NAx103 allele. The de novo NAx103 allele (recovered independently 4 times) is an in-frame deletion of 3 nucleotides spanning positions \u22123 to \u22125 relative to the PAM sequence that eliminates a serine codon present in the wild-type Notch sequence. Master females carrying the NAx103 allele transmitted the DsRed and Ax phenotype and converted the receiver (w\u2212) target chromosome to Ax at frequencies similar to those observed with the PAM disrupting NAx16 allele. These results suggest that copy-cutting is also efficient for various alleles that disrupt residues critical for gRNA target site recognition.",
                                "Copy grafting: is a broadly applicable allelic drive strategy. The experiments described above demonstrate highly efficient allelic-drive of the NAx16 allele via copy-cutting mechanism, exceeding by nearly a third that observed for the y<ccN> gene-drive CopyCat element. While these results are encouraging, the obvious limitation of such a strategy lies in the requirement for a gRNA to selectively cut the targeted undesired allele. This constraint requires that the preferred allele either lacks a PAM site or differs from the targeted allele in core gRNA sequences (\u02dc1-5 nucleotides from the PAM site), which would occur in only a fraction of cases (\u02dc60% of single nucleotide polymorphisms if GG di-nucleotides occur at a frequency of 1/16 and are randomly distributed). A more general allelic-drive method was also developed in this invention by making use of the fact that homology directed repair (HDR) is often accompanied by local gene conversion events spanning as much as several hundred nucleotides from the double stranded cleavage site15. This local repair phenomenon has been well documented in Drosophila16-18, and may reflect the range of 3\u2032 resection during the DNA repair process16.",
                                "With the above motivating concept in mind, and the rich array of genetic variants available in Drosophila, as well as those generated in this study, a reverse-drive scenario wherein the wild-type N+IS allele should be preferentially inherited over a different cleavage-sensitive, Abruptex allele (AxE2) was conceived. The NAxE2 allele results from a C\u2192T substitution located 21 bp upstream of the cleavage resistant NAx16 G\u2192A alteration (FIG. 4A). The NAxE2 allele, however, should be sensitive to cleavage by the gRNA-N+ carried on the y<ccN> CopyCat element since it lies at a sufficient distance from the gRNA cut site (17 bp, FIG. 4A, NAxE2 indicated as N*S in FIG. 4B).",
                                "Specifically, FIGS. 4A-4D show an allelic drive mediated by \u201ccopy-grafting\u201d. FIG. 4A shows DNA sequence at the gRNA-N+ cleavage site for the wild-type reference allele (N+S), the cleavage-insensitive wild-type (N+IS), and the cleavage-sensitive NAxE2 allele (N*S), with the C\u2192T substitution (see FIG. 10 for amino-acid substitutions). FIG. 4B shows a copy-grafting scheme in which F1 master females carrying a wild type cleavage insensitive wild-type Notch allele in trans to the sensitive NAxE2 allele (y<ccN> w3 N+IS/y+ w+ NAxE2; Cas9/+ \u2640) are crossed to N+IS \u2642. F2 progeny were then scored based on inheritance of the y<ccN> w2 N+IS donor chromosome or the w+ receiver chromosome (dark gray) based on their eye color phenotype (orange for donor and red for receiver). Arrowheads indicate copying of the y<ccN> element and the N+IS allele respectively. FIG. 4C shows a percent of F2 progeny demonstrating features of drive including: percent of converted N+IS receiver chromosomes (gray circles\u2014clustered around 78.2%); heterozygous N\u2212/+ females (black circles); and copying of the DsRed marked y<ccN> element to receiver chromosome (gray circles\u2014clustered around 72.9% and 61.3%). FIG. 4D shows a summary of different drive systems. MCR (full gene-drive) elements have both Cas9 and a gRNA inserted into the genome at the gRNA-directed cleavage site, CopyCat (split-drive) elements carry only the gRNA inserted at the gRNA-directed cleavage site, while a Cas9 is provided from a Mendelian transgene at a different genomic location. Copy-cutting (special allelic-drive) is mediated by two gRNAs. One gRNA (light gray) propagates the CopyCat element while the second gRNA creating allelic-drive (dark gray) cuts a non-preferred allele, but not the favored allele (lock icon). This drive element can be either an MCR (including Cas9) or a CopyCat element (Cas9 provided from a separate genomic location, as depicted in this figure). Copy-grafting (general allelic-drive) is mediated by a gRNA that cuts the non-preferred, but not the favored, chromosome near the desired allelic variant, resulting in conversion of a short region of the receiving chromosome (indicated by highlighting) with sequences from the donor chromosome (gray box) that encompass the favored allele (lock icon).",
                                "If the y<ccN> CopyCat element were recombined with the wild-type N+IS cleavage insensitive allele, which carries a single nucleotide change (C\u2192A) at the \u22124 position (FIG. 4A), it might be possible to drive that wild-type N allele onto a receiving chromosome carrying the NAxE2 allele. This inverse-drive scheme depicted in FIG. 4B is referred to as copy-grafting.",
                                "Results in FIG. 4C reveal that the efficiency of inverse allelic-drive via copy-grafting (78.2% conversion of receiver chromosomes in males) was comparable to that observed by copy-cutting (79.5% conversion\u2014FIG. 1F). Also, as was observed for copy-cutting, copy-grafting resulted in a deficiency of receiver chromosomes in F2 \u2642 progeny, in the generation of N\u2212 alleles (\u02dc16%; when F1 master females were crossed to N+IS \u2642 to protect the paternal chromosome from lethal mosaicism), and in strongly correlated co-drive between the y<ccN> and NAxE2 alleles (FIG. 16).",
                                "Specifically, FIG. 16 shows copy-grafting sustains efficient co-drive. The frequency of allelic conversion to the N+IS phenotype among receiver chromosomes (marked with the w+ allele) was tabulated among individuals in which the y<ccN> CopyCat allele had also copied or not. As in the case of copy-cutting drive of the NAx16 allele, a strong enrichment of N+IS copying events was observed among those that had also copied the y<ccN> allele relative to those that did not.",
                                "FIGS. 18A-18B show preliminary cage trial experiments for copy-grafting allelic-drive in a Cas9 recipient population. In FIG. 18A, the ccN drive element and favored non-cleavable allele N+IS were introduced through virgin master females (y<ccN> N+IS/+ N*S; Cas9/+) into a recipient population carrying a cleavage-sensitive Notch allele and homozygous for a vasa-Cas9 transgene (+N*S/+ N*S; Cas9/Cas9). Note that the Cas9 transgene carries a functional yellow transgene marker. In flies carrying the drive, this y+ marker is mutated to y\u2212 in a Cas9-dependent fashion, resulting in an initial fitness disadvantage relative to the y+ recipient population (y\u2212 males suffer a severe competitive mating disadvantage, a well-known phenomenon(36). This y\u2212/y+ assortative mating barrier is likely to be responsible for the initial dip in N+IS allelic frequency observed in males. Starting allele frequencies: Master females represent 25% of the initial population, the initial N+IS allelic frequency is 16.6%, and the overall prevalence of the Cas9 transgene is 87.5%. Control cages include the same initial genotypes at identical proportions without introduction of Cas9. Four independent cages were set up for vasa-Cas9 and control populations. FIG. 18B shows in the left panel: N+IS allelic frequency measured in males over 5 generations. \u02dc150 males were scored for each cage at each generation. By generation 5, the N+IS allele reached a near-fixation level (95.2%) in Cas9 cages, while remaining at a stable \u02dc50% representation over three consecutive generations in control cages. Note that the initial N+IS allelic percentage in males is 0%, since all males in the F0 population are N*S. Right panel: Presence of the ccN drive element measured in each population (males and females combined) through DsRed marker scoring. \u02dc300 individuals were scored for each cage at each generation. DsRed frequencies are higher (77.6%) in Cas9 populations than in control populations (62%). This relatively modest difference may be caused by the accumulation of drive resistant y\u2212 NHEJ alleles in the Cas9 population and may in part reflect the assortative mating disadvantage suffered by the male progeny of the initial F1 master females. Despite this less efficient drive of the ccN element, the N+IS allele is driven to high prevalence in Cas9 populations. This cross scheme simulates an important potential application of gRNA-only \u201cCHACR\u201d elements that can be used to update gene-drive content(6). In this scenario, a full gene-drive element has spread to near completion in a population. In that background of broad Cas9 prevalence, a CHACR is released to improve some performance aspect of the gene-drive. The CHACR is expected to spread geometrically into the population following the same logistic growth curve as a full-gene drive in a na\u00efve population.",
                                "FIGS. 19A-19 show preliminary cage trial experiments for copy grafting in an allelic pump paradigm where a fixed percentage of Cas9+drive cassette (introduced at equal frequencies) are released into a na\u00efve (non Cas9) recipient population. In FIG. 19A, the ccN drive element and a cleavage resistant Notch+ (N+IS) allele were introduced via virgin master females (y<ccN> N+IS/+ N*S; Cas9/+) into recipient population homozygous for the N*S allele (+N*S/+N*S; +/+). Starting allele frequencies: Master females represent 25% of the initial population, the initial frequency of the N+IS allele is 16.6%, and the seeding frequency of Cas9 is 12.5%. Control cages include the same initial genotypes at identical proportions without introduction of Cas9 from master females. Four cages were set up for Cas9 and control population. In FIG. 19B, in the left panel: N+IS allelic frequency measured in males for two generations. \u02dc150 males were scored for each cage at each generation. The N+IS allele has reached significantly higher frequency (65.1%) in Cas9 cages than in control cages (48.4%). As shown in FIGS. 18A-18B, the initial N+IS percentage in males is 0. Right panel: Presence of the ccN drive element measured in each population (males and females combined) through DsRed marker scoring. \u02dc300 individuals were scored for each cage at each generation. DsRed frequencies are significantly higher (74.9%) in Cas9 populations than in control populations (55%). This cross scheme simulates an allelic pump scenario(6) in which a fixed percentage of individuals carrying a Cas9 transgene and a gRNA-only cassette are released into a wild-type population. Under these conditions the increase in gRNA-cassette frequency is additive at each generation (i.e., initially equals the percent of Cas9 prevalence in the population=12.5% in this experiment). This allelic pump system represents the weakest form of a Cas9 driven bipartite element.",
                                "This invention has demonstrated the feasibility of two forms of allelic-drive: copy-cutting, which applies to cases in which a gRNA can be designed to selectively target a non-preferred allele; and copy-grafting, a more general strategy in which one associates a cleavage-resistant site in proximity to a favored allelic variant (FIG. 4D). Both allelic-drive systems are significantly more efficient than a gene-drive CopyCat element inserted into the yellow locus. An important mechanism contributing to the efficient allelic drive, which is of potential relevance to field applications, is the phenomena of lethal mosaicism, which dominantly eliminates all NHEJ-induced drive-resistant non-functional loss-of-function alleles of an essential gene such as Notch. Shadow-drive, in which perduring Cas9-gRNA complexes transmitted maternally for one generation in the absence of the Cas9 or gRNA transgenes, should also act as a genetic slingshot to extend gene or allelic-drives for one additional generation should they become separated from a Cas9 source. Interestingly, a strong correlation between copying events resulting in preferential transmission of both the gene-drive cassette and the preferred non-cleavable allele was demonstrated. This co-drive phenomenon depends on chromosome pairing, as it is not observed when the receiver chromosome carries an inversion affecting the targeted gene. Similar correlated genome editing events have been reported recently in other systems including in the germline19 and in somatic cells20. With regard to copy-cutting, the recent development of Cas9 variants with broadened PAM specificity21,22 will substantially increase the fraction of alleles that can be driven by this method. Development of such systems should function with various sources Cas9, as allelic drive with a nanos-Cas9 was observed as efficiently as with the vasa-Cas9 source (FIG. 17). Altogether, the allelic drive strategies as demonstrated by this invention are broadly applicable to various gene targets in diverse experimental and agricultural contexts.",
                                "Specifically, FIG. 17 shows the nanos-Cas9 source sustains efficient allelic conversion, but also induces more male lethal NHEJ events than observed with the vasa-Cas9 source. From left to right: Percentages of F2 progeny inheriting a Receiver chromosome. Control crosses show a notable bias in favor of the w\u2212 receiver chromosome allele (\u02dc60% transmission) in male progeny, presumably due to a fitness cost associated with the NAx16 allele present on the donor chromosome. Progeny from nanos-Cas9 master females show a much stronger reduction in receiver chromosome inheritance (16.3%) in comparison to what is observed with vasa-Cas9 (36.7%) master females (MF). This reduction is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of N\u2212 NHEJ alleles recovered among F2 Receiver females from nanos-Cas9 master females. In contrast, the percent conversion of DsRed and the NAx16 allele among receiver progenies from nanos-Cas9 versus vasa-Cas9 master females is not significantly different. Consistent with the hypothesis that the nanos-Cas9 source generates lethal Notch alleles more often than vasa-Cas9, a higher frequency of N\u2212/N+IS F2 females were recovered using nanos-Cas9 versus vasa-Cas9. Cumulatively these data suggest that the modest increase in apparent efficiency of the nanos-Cas9 versus vasa-Cas9 source in y<ccN> and NAx16 transmission reflects increased rates of generating lethal NHEJ (Notch-) alleles rather than an increase in the rate of copying (conversion).",
                                "One important category of potential applications of this invention is the aggregation of multiple favored naturally occurring allelic variants in plants or animals. In plants, allelic drive schemes can facilitate combining favorable traits to improve crop yields and resistance to environmental stresses, particularly in polyploid species (e.g., wheat or rye). Similarly in animal models, active genetics can accelerate the construction of complex genotypes in model organisms for biomedical and basic research. For example, one can envision crossing individual plants or animals bearing a favored allele to a strain carrying a Mendelian cassette with Cas9 and a gRNA that target the corresponding non-preferred alleles. The Cas9 bearing progeny also inheriting the first favored allele can then be crossed to a strain carrying the second favored allele and a guide RNA targeting the second unwanted allele, and so on until all favored alleles are gathered into a single strain. Finally, one can perform a final cross to segregate out the Cas9-gRNA cassettes. In polyploid crops such a strategy should permit assembly of several preferred alleles providing drought resistance23, higher yields24, optimal architectures25, or more rapid growth26 that would be long, difficult or impossible to assemble into a single strain by standard genetic crossing schemes.",
                                "Another important class of allelic-drive applications of this invention is to reverse pesticide resistance in pest species. Use of insecticides has repeatedly led to the emergence of specific insecticide-resistant alleles in insect disease vectors and crop pests. Many pesticides target essential components of the nervous system such as the Na+ channel or glutamate receptor27. Allelic drive systems can help revert these populations back to their wild-type sensitive state, which would be aided by the reduced fitness of certain prominent insecticide resistant alleles in the absence of pesticide use28-30. Even modest reductions in the incidence of resistant alleles (e.g., to prevalence of <50%) can have major positive impacts on disease reduction strategies31,32. Similarly, allelic drives can be used to favor genetic variants that prevent host species from serving as disease vectors or pests.",
                                "One potential concern in such allelic drive scenarios is whether NHEJ-induced cleavage resistant alleles can also be driven by the gRNA intended to drive the favored allele. This run-away NHEJ problem might arise if the primary drive cassette became separated from the preferred allele and instead became associated with an undesired NHEJ-induced allele. Several lines of evidence presented in this invention show that this scenario is unlikely so long as the gRNA sustaining allelic drive targets a critical region of an essential gene such as Notch (or the Na+ ion channel). Firstly, the strong co-drive greatly limits the number of events separating the favored allele from the drive element (only a few percent). Secondly, lethal mosaicism eliminated 100% of the progeny carrying three different NHEJ-induced N\u2212 alleles and also killed all offspring carrying the gene-drive element and unprotected wild-type alleles. Finally, allelic-drives work very effectively in-trans as well as in-cis, so that should an uncoupling event occur, it would be rapidly reversed in most instances. Thus, all non-functional NHEJ alleles will be eliminated immediately as they are generated, and drive of the favored allele will persist either in-cis or in-trans. The only remaining concern is whether one might not occasionally create a functional non-cleavable version of the undesired allele that can then also be driven. While this is possible (e.g., rare N+IS and novel Ax alleles were recovered), such events are very infrequent and should not drive any more efficiently than the overwhelmingly prevalent preferred allele. It is possible to further reduce the production of such rare events by using two gRNAs simultaneously, one directing copy-cutting and the other copy-grafting of the same preferred allele. Thus, it is practical to drive preferred alleles of essential genes efficiently into a population so long as they do not impart a significant fitness cost relative to the non-preferred allele.",
                                "Lethal mosaicism also has game-changing implications for developing new efficient gene-drive systems. A drive element targeting a critical site in a gene essential for viability or reproduction can also carry a functional recoded (and non-cleavable) portion of that same gene, thereby protecting progeny inheriting this element from lethal (or sterile) mosaicism. In contrast, non-functional NHEJ-induced mutations rendered dominant by lethal mosaicism are eliminated immediately, thereby \u201ckilling or sterilizing the mistakes\u201d and providing a powerful solution to the frequently highlighted drive-resistance problem. These and other diverse applications of allelic-drive will greatly expand the impact of active genetics, accelerating progress in many areas of synthetic biology.",

Bottom panel: Linear map showing integration of the ccN element into the yellow locus and the locations of primers used to PCR amplify fragments for sequencing. Insertion of the ccN element into its target site and its flanking genomic sequences were amplified using primers located beyond (\u02dc300 bp) the HA1 and HA2 arms (pS1: CGACTCAGCTCACGTATTTCATACAG with pAS1: CTCCCCCTGAACCTGAAACATAAAATG, and pS2:CAGGAGCTCCAGCTTTTGTGCTAG with pAS2:GAGAATATACCCAAGTACCGTGTGTAG) and fully sequenced, which confirmed a perfect insertion of the element into the intended genomic target site. Sequences within the ccN element were identical to those in the vector shown in Table 1. The full nomenclature for the ccN CopyCat element according to previously established convention for active genetic elements1,2 is: y<CC|gRNA-y1, gRNA-N+|3XP3DsRed>, hereinafter abbreviated in the text as y<ccN> for convenience. The complete DNA sequence of the ccN element is provided in Table 1.",

An injection mix containing the ccN plasmid (final concentration: 250 ng/\u03bcl) was sent to Best Gene Inc. for injection into embryos collected from a w3 NAx16 rb\u2212 stock (which is resistant to the otherwise lethal mutagenesis of the Notch locus generated by Cas9/gRNA-N+) with a transient source of pHsp70-Cas9 (Addgene plasmid #45945). The w3 NAx16 rb\u2212 stock was kindly provided by Jim Posakony (UCSD). Male transformants carrying the ccN element were identified in F1 progeny by virtue of their yellow\u2212 and DsRed fluorescent eye-marker phenotypes. This genomic insertional allele is referred to as: y<CC|gRNA-y1, gRNA-N+|3XP3DsRed> in accordance with the previously established nomenclature convention6,7 (see FIG. 5 for details of the construct). For shorthand in the text, this allele is referred to as: y<ccN>. The ccN plasmid construct was fully sequenced prior to injection as well as that of the ccN genomic insertion for several individual y<ccN> transformant lines, which included PCR amplification and sequencing of endogenous sequences lying adjacent to those included as homology arm templates in the plasmid construct to verify accurate insertion of the ccN element into the intended site (Table 1).",

Crosses were performed at 25\u00b0 C. on standard Drosophila food. The y\u2212 w+ NAxE2 carrying a gRNA-N+ sensitive Abruptex allele was kindly provided by Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas (Harvard University).

For quantitative analyses of F2 progeny (or F3 progeny for the Shadow drive), 20-37 crosses consisting of 3 females mated to 3 males were analyzed for each experiment, yielding an average of \u02dc150 flies per cross. A total of 29,000 progeny were analyzed for this study.",

        "1. A method of introducing a preferred nucleotide sequence into a genome by allelic-drive copy-cutting, comprising genomically replacing a non-preferred nucleotide sequence with that of a preferred allele of the same gene using an allelic-drive element that comprises first and second guide RNAs and a cleavage resistant preferred allele, wherein a Cas endonuclease guided by the first guide RNA copies the allelic-drive element, and a Cas endonuclease guided by the second guide RNA cuts the non-preferred allele, but not the preferred allele, and copies the cleavage resistant preferred allele into a double stranded DNA break created by the second guide RNA by homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated repair.",
        "2. A method of introducing a preferred nucleotide sequence into a genome by allelic-drive copy-grafting, comprising genomically replacing a non-preferred nucleotide sequence with that of a preferred allele of the same gene using an allelic-drive element that comprises a first and a second guide RNAs and a cleavage resistant site adjacent to the preferred allele, wherein Cas endonuclease guided by the first guide RNA copies the allelic-drive element, and the second guide RNA cuts the non-preferred allele, but not the preferred allele, that is associated with the cleavage resistant sequence residing within less than 100 nucleotides of the preferred allele, and copies the cleavage resistant sequence together with the preferred adjacent allele by virtue of a short range single stranded resection step which occurs during homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated repair.",
        "3. The method of claim 1, wherein the Cas endonuclease is not integrated into the allelic-drive element.",
        "4. The method of claim 1, wherein Cas endonuclease is integrated into the allelic drive element and transmission of both alleles is super-Mendelian.",
        "5. The method of claim 1, wherein allelic conversion of both alleles in a second filial generation is at least 40%, 50%, 60% or 70%",
        "6. The method of claim 2, wherein allelic conversion of both alleles in a second filial generation is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 97%.",

        "8. The method of claim 1, wherein progeny, which maintain an association between a first allele comprising an allelic-drive element and a second uncleavable allele, survive in the presence of Cas9.",
        "9. The method of claim 1, wherein perduring Cas9-gRNA complexes are transmitted maternally for one generation in the absence of Cas9 or gRNA transgenes.",
        "10. The method of claim 1, wherein the allelic-drive element is inserted into an essential gene required for viability or fertility and also carries functional recoded sequences of the essential gene rendering the allelic drive element viable in a homozygous or hemizygous state.",
        "11. The method of claim 10, wherein the functional recoded sequences of the essential gene are recoded as a direct in-frame fusion with recoded cDNA sequences inserted at the 5 end of the allelic drive element abutting the guide RNA cut site.",
        "12. The method of claim 10, wherein the essential gene is Notch, Rab11, Rab5, Rab1; Prosalpha1, Dpp=decapentaplegic, EGF-Receptor; Mre11, Spo11, cinnabar=kynurenine hydroxylase; doublesex; a gene encoding a male-specific tubulin subunit; cardinal, ENa=sodium ion channel, or FREP1.",
