                        "Enlarged, hypertrophic adipocytes are less responsive to insulin and are a hallmark feature of obesity, contributing to many of the negative metabolic consequences of excess adipose tissue. Although the mechanisms remain unclear, adipocyte size appears to be inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, wherein smaller adipocytes are insulin sensitive, and larger adipocytes develop insulin resistance and exhibit impaired glucose uptake. Thus, pharmacological strategies aimed at regulating adipocyte hypertrophy (increase in adipocyte size) in favor of promoting hyperplasia (increase in adipocyte number) have the potential to improve adipocyte insulin sensitivity and provide therapeutic benefit in the context of metabolic disorders."

                                "Disclosed herein are methods of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) a disorder or having a disorder associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is generally associated with prediabetes, type II diabetes, coronary artery disease, malglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, renal dysfunction, atherosclerosis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, low grade chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, essential hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, prothrombotic state, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Insulin resistance is also associated with rare insulin resistance syndromes Type A and Type B, agromegaly, polycystic ovarian syndrome, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Cumulatively, insulin resistance syndromes, including, but not limited to diabetes, underlie many of the major causes of morbidity and death of people over age 40. Accordingly, the disclosed methods for the prevention and/or treatment of insulin resistance and associated syndromes in a subject can involve administering an effective amount of an MCT1 inhibitor to a subject in need thereof. For example, a subject can be administered an MCT1 inhibitor in an effort to improve the sensitivity of mammalian adipose tissues to insulin. In one embodiment, the MCT1 inhibitors are useful to prevent drug-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and/or diabetes, when the MCT1 inhibitor is administered with a drug that shows a side-effect of causing one or more of these conditions (e.g., olanzapine, Zyprexa\u00ae).",

In prophylactic applications, pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments of MCT1 inhibitors are administered to a subject susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a disease or condition in an amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease. Administration of a prophylactic MCT1 inhibitor can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the aberrancy, such that a disease or disorder is prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression.",

An amount adequate to accomplish therapeutic or prophylactic treatment is defined as a therapeutically- or prophylactically-effective dose. These modulatory methods can be performed in vitro (e.g., by culturing the cell with the MCT1 inhibitor) or, alternatively, in vivo (e.g., by administering the MCT1 inhibitor to a subject). As such, the invention provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with an insulin resistance-associated disease or disorder.",

                                "Over the last four decades there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of obesity with recent reports (2017-2018) indicating that >73% of the adult US population is overweight with a body mass index (BMI)>25 kg/m2, and 42.5% designated as obese (BMI>30 kg/m2). Concomitant with the trends in obesity is the marked increase in the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) where greater than 85% of T2DM patients are also obese (Apovian, C M, et al. Adv. Ther. 2019 36:44-58). T2DM is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia arising from a combination of impaired insulin secretion, increased hepatic glucose production, and decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake (insulin resistance) (Kahn, S E, et al. Lancet 2014 383:1068-1083). In addition to the epidemiological evidence establishing obesity as the leading risk factor for T2DM (Barnes, A S, et al. Texas Hear. Inst. J. 2011 38:142-144), the molecular mechanisms through which obesity contributes to the development of insulin resistance in insulin-responsive tissues (i.e., skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver) can be largely credited to the inability of mature white adipocytes to perpetually expand to accommodate excess energy in the form of triglycerides. To compensate, \u2018lipid overflow\u2019 into ectopic sites (i.e., liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and pancreas) occurs at the expense of inducing lipotoxicity and insulin resistance (Gustafson, B, et al. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2015 26:193-200).",
                                "After reaching lipid saturation, adipocytes can undergo hypertrophy (increase in adipocyte size) or hyperplasia (increase in number of adipocytes) to accommodate for increased triglyceride storage needs (Ghaben, A L, et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. cell Biol. 2019 20:242-258). Although a subset of obese individuals referred to as metabolically \u2018healthy\u2019 obese maintain adipose tissue expandability through hyperplasia, adipose tissue expansion in the majority of obese individuals occurs primarily through hypertrophy (Iacobini, C, et al. Metabolism 2019 92:51-60). In this context, enlarged adipocytes have a profound impact on the metabolic health of adipose tissue and in regulating insulin sensitivity (Kim, S M, et al. Cell Metab. 2014 20:1049-1058), glucose uptake and inflammation (Haczeyni, F, et al. Obes. Rev. 2018 19:406-420). It has long been appreciated that increased adipocyte size correlates to systemic insulin resistance (Salans, L B, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1968 47:153-165) while smaller adipocytes retain insulin sensitivity. As adipocyte hypertrophy contributes to many of the adverse metabolic events associated with obesity, inducing hyperplasia or cell division in hypertrophic adipocytes has the potential to redistribute lipid content and improve the overall metabolic health of obese individuals. Hence, it has recently been suggested that inducing hyperplasia to improve the metabolic \u2018health\u2019 of adipocytes may be an alternative therapeutic strategy to weight loss to treat insulin-resistance and related metabolic disease (Salans, L B, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1968 47:153-165).",
                                "Under normal physiological conditions, adipocyte hyperplasia occurs in response to the secretion of paracrine growth factors leading to an increase in the number of preadipocytes within the adipose tissue depot, and their subsequent differentiation into mature adipocytes. This process is dependent on the tight regulation of several cell cycle related events including the growth arrest of proliferating preadipocytes, the coordinated re-entry into the cell cycle through mitotic clonal expansion, and finally, terminal differentiation (Salans, L B, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1968 47:153-165). However, it has been proposed that mature adipocytes also contribute to hyperplasia either through de-differentiation (Suwa, A, et al. FEBS J. 2011 278:565-569), subsequent proliferation and re-differentiation (Salans, L B, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1968 47:153-165), or re-entry of mature adipocytes into the cell cycle (Okamatsu-Ogura, Y, et al. Sci. Rep. 2017 7:1-12; Kajita, K, et al. Endocr. J. 2013 EJ13-0141; Sugihara, H, et al. J. Lipid Res. 1987 28:1038-1045). Thus, proteins or signaling pathways that regulate adipocyte growth arrest and cell cycle could promote hyperplasia and have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of various metabolic disorders.",
                                "As disclosed herein, one such protein is the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1); one of 14 members of the SLC16a solute carrier gene family encoding monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Within this subfamily, MCT1, MCT2, MCT3 and MCT4 have been identified as proton-linked, bidirectional transporters responsible for the influx and efflux of monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies and certain drugs across the plasma membrane (Halestrap, A P. IUBMB Life 2012 64:1-9). In addition to regulating lactate trafficking, MCT1 is a well-established target of c-Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor that drives continuous cell growth and division (Doherty, J R, et al. Cancer Res 2014 74:908-920), and is highly upregulated in proliferating cells (DeBerardinis, R J, et al. Cell Metab. 2008 7:11-20). Interestingly, MCT1 expression has also been reported to increase over the course of adipocyte differentiation owing to increased lactate flux as preadipocytes mature into adipocytes (Petersen, C, et al. Sci. Rep. 2017 7:13101). Adipocytes are highly glycolytic even under conditions of excess oxygenation and contribute significantly to circulating lactate levels, particularly in obese individuals (Jansson, P A, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1994 93:240-246). Furthermore, serum lactate levels have been shown to directly correlate with insulin resistance in obese and non-obese individuals (Jansson, P A, et al. J. Clin. Invest. 1994 93:240-246). While enhanced lactate metabolism and MCT1 expression is associated with adipocyte differentiation, proliferation and systemic insulin resistance, the relationship between these processes and the influence of modulating MCT1-mediated lactate flux in adipocytes is unknown.",
                                "By regulating intracellular lactate concentration, MCT1 also plays an important role in regulating redox homeostasis (Brooks, G A. Redox Biol. 2020 35:101454; Carri\u00e8re, A, et al. J. Physiol. Biochem. 2020 76:241-250). In adipocytes, lactate abundance and MCT1 function have been shown to impact redox signaling mechanisms with widespread biological consequences. This is primarily accredited to the function of lactate as an electron donor, enabling the reduction of NAD+ to NADH through its lactate dehydrogenase catalyzed oxidation to pyruvate (Rabinowitz, J D, et al. Nat. Metab. 2020 2:566-571). While it is known that redox signaling is critical to cell cycle progression and growth arrest (Chiu, J, et al. Trends Cell Biol. 2012 22:592-601), it has been recently reported that MCT1 mediated lactate transport induces plasticity and mitochondrial biogenesis as a mechanism to alleviate redox pressure in mature adipocytes (Carri\u00e8re, A, et al. Diabetes 2014 63:3253-3265).",
                                "In this study, using the classical white adipocyte cell model, murine 3T3-L1 cells, it is demonstrated that treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of MCT1 (AZD3965) results in the re-entry of mature adipocytes into the cell cycle. The adipogenic profile of differentiated 3T3-L1 cells treated with an MCT1 inhibitor is altered at mRNA, protein, and phenotypic levels wherein these cells exhibit distinct transcript and protein expression signatures, as well as, a decrease in lipid content and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Thus, inhibiting MCT1 activity in mature adipocytes may serve as a novel mechanism to induce re-entry of fully differentiated adipocytes into the cell cycle with the potential to promote adipocyte proliferation and hyperplasia.",

                                "Murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, namely 3T3-L1, were cultured and differentiated into mature lipid-laden adipocytes according to well established protocols (Zebisch, K, et al. Anal. Biochem. 2012 425:88-90). In agreement with previous reports, MCT1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells was confirmed at both mRNA and protein levels (FIGS. 1A, and 1B,1C, respectively). To enable the study of genetically inhibiting MCT1 expression, 3T3-L1 cells transduced with short hairpin RNA directed against MCT1 (shMCT1) or a scrambled RNA (shScramble) were used to generate stable 3T3-L1 cell lines depleted of MCT1, and a shRNA 3T3-L1 control cell line (3T3-L1-shMCT1 and 3T3-L1-shScramble, respectively). Successful knockdown of MCT1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in 3T3-L1-shMCT1 was demonstrated with reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting (FIGS. 1A, and 1B,1C, respectively).",
                                "To determine the effect of pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 on adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated with or without 1 \u03bcM AZD3965, the previously described potent and selective, small molecule MCT1 inhibitor (Curtis, N J, et al. Oncotarget 2017 8:69219-69236). As expected, by day 6 of the differentiation process both control 3T3-L1 and shScramble cells began forming lipid droplets as measured by Oil Red O staining (FIG. 1D,1E). Conversely, 3T3-L1 cells that were differentiated in the presence of 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 and 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells contained significantly less lipid over the course of differentiation (FIG. 1D; third and fourth panels respectively). The quantification of Oil Red O area (i.e. lipid content) is presented in FIG. 1E.",

                                "Shortly after exposure to differentiation media (containing insulin, dexamethasone and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)) the adipogenic gene expression program is induced upregulating various transcription factors and adipose-specific genes. Thus, protein expression of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), considered to be the master regulator of adipogenesis, and the PPAR\u03b3 regulated adipocyte markers, Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 4 (FABP4/aP2) (Tontonoz, P, et al. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008 77:289-312), and Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) (Deng, T, et al. Endocrinology 2006 147:875-884), were analyzed. As expected, expression of these adipocyte related proteins increased as differentiation progressed in untreated 3T3-L1 cells and in 3T3-L1-shscramble cells. However, in 3T3-L1 cells differentiated in the presence of AZD3965, and shMCT1 containing 3T3-L1 cells, the expression levels of PPAR\u03b3, HSL and FABP4 were significantly attenuated (FIGS. 1F,1G).",
                                "Mature Adipocytes Show Reduced Lipid Content, but Remain Differentiated after MCT1 Inhibition",
                                "Similar experiments to those carried out in differentiating preadipocytes were performed to assess the impact of MCT1 inhibition on fully differentiated, \u2018mature\u2019 adipocytes. Differentiated adipocytes show a progressive decrease in lipid content following 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 treatment (FIGS. 2A, 2B; microscopy and quantification respectively). A viability assay performed on these cells demonstrated that the reduction in lipid content was not due to AZD3965-induced cytotoxicity (FIG. 2C). After cell death was eliminated as a potential explanation for the observed depletion in adipocyte lipid content, changes in lipid metabolism were examined. As nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADP+/NADPH) are critical cofactors for lipid biosynthesis, changes in the bioavailability of NADP+ and NADPH were monitored. A subtle, yet significant decrease in the concentration of this cofactor species was observed following 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr of MCT1 inhibition (FIG. 1E) suggesting that AZD3965 treated cells are unable to support the high rates of lipogenesis characteristic of adipocytes. The influence of MCT1 inhibition on rates of lipolysis, the primary mechanism of triglyceride catabolism into glycerol and free fatty acids in adipocytes, was also probed. AZD3965 treatment significantly increased intracellular glycerol levels at all time points measured (FIG. 2E) indicating that MCT1 inhibition results in a significant increase in cellular lipolysis.",
                                "In addition to assessing changes in lipid content and metabolism in MCT1 inhibitor treated cells, transcript and protein expression levels of the aforementioned adipogenic proteins, PPAR\u03b3, FABP4, and HSL, were also assessed following inhibitor treatment (FIGS. 2F, 2G, and 6A) to determine if these adipocytes remain differentiated following AZD3965 treatment. Although RT-qPCR demonstrated a significant decrease in PPAR\u03b3 transcript levels in mature adipocytes following 24 hr of treatment with AZD3965 (FIG. 2F), no changes in PPAR\u03b3 protein expression were observed following up to 72 hr of AZD3965 treatment (FIG. 2G). On the other hand, changes in transcript levels of FABP4 did correlate with corresponding changes in protein expression. Specifically, FABP4 mRNA levels were significantly increased following 24 hr of MCT1 inhibition (FIG. 2F) and this was reflected at the protein level for up to 48 hr of compound treatment; however, by 72 hr this increase was attenuated (FIG. 2G). Conversely, MCT1 inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in HSL expression following 24-72 hr of compound treatment (FIG. 2G). In addition to monitoring changes in the expression of these adipogenic proteins, changes in adipokine secretion following treatment with AZD3965 were also assessed utilizing an adipokine antibody microarray. Conditioned media collected from adipocytes that had been treated with or without AZD3965 for 72 hr showed no significant differences in adipokine levels (FIGS. 2H and 6B) supporting the premise that adipocytes remain differentiated following MCT1 inhibition.",
                                "RNA Sequencing Reveals Transcriptional Consequences of MCT1 Inhibition in Adipocytes",
                                "Because the major role of MCT1 is the transport of lactate, pyruvate, and other mono-carboxylates across the plasma membrane, intracellular lactate concentration was measured at discrete time points ranging from 15 min to 24 hr of 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 treatment. Within 15 minutes of treatment, a significant increase in intracellular lactate was observed (FIG. 3A) and was maintained through the first 4 hr of AZD3965 treatment. With export inhibited, lactate can be disposed of through its oxidation back into pyruvate or its direct, complete oxidation in the mitochondria. To examine these potential fates of lactate, changes in intracellular pyruvate and the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio, often used as a proxy for cellular pyruvate/lactate (Rabinowitz, J D, et al. Nat. Metab. 2020 2:566-571), were monitored over the same time course. It was observed that MCT1 inhibition resulted in a significant increase in intracellular pyruvate following the first 8 hr of treatment (FIG. 2B), and a significant change in the ratio of NAD+/NADH across all time points measured (FIG. 3C). Specifically, a significant decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio was observed for the first 8 hr of AZD3965 treatment indicating an increase in lactate relative to pyruvate. These results suggest that AZD3965 treatment leads to a significant increase in both intracellular lactate and pyruvate and a relative increase in lactate compared with pyruvate.",
                                "After 24 hr of AZD3965 treatment, intracellular lactate levels were diminished to values approximately 2 fold above basal and intracellular pyruvate levels were not significantly altered (FIGS. 3A,3B), suggesting that differentiated 3T3-L1 cells adapt within this time-period to manage high intracellular lactate levels and a change in the NAD+/NADH ratio resulting from MCT1 inhibition. These findings along with the previously observed significant decrease in intracellular lipid content were suggestive of transcriptional changes taking place within 24 hr. To interrogate the consequences of MCT1 inhibition in mature adipocytes, a transcriptomics analysis was conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by a comprehensive pathway analysis on adipocytes treated with or without 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 for 24 hr.",
                                "Results from the RNA-seq experiment indicated that 277 genes were significantly (p<0.05) differentially expressed following MCT1 inhibition. Pathway analysis conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that these differentially expressed genes, including the cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (Ding, L, et al. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 21:1960), polo-like kinase (PLK1) (Ma, X, et al. Nat. Commun. 2017 8:1-15), and DNA topoisomerase 2-\u03b1 (TO2A) (Mjelle, R, et al. DNA Repair (Amst). 2015 30:53-67) among others, are largely implicated in the regulation of cell cycle and mitosis (FIG. 3D). Genes involved in the progression of cell cycle show a significant upregulation in treated adipocytes, while genes that inhibit cell cycle progression (e.g., DUSP1) (Liu, Y X, et al. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008 6:624-633) were significantly decreased (FIG. 3E). Furthermore, molecular functions predicted to be significantly altered included cellular development, cell growth and proliferation, as well as cellular assembly and organization (FIG. 3D). Pathway analysis also predicted the activation of cytokinesis (the cytoplasmic division of a cell at the end of mitosis or meiosis, bringing about the separation into two daughter cells (Alberts, B, et al. Cytokinesis. In Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition; Garland Science, 2002)). Taken together, a transcriptional fingerprint characterized by the upregulation of mRNAs related to cell cycle and proliferation suggested potential for adipocytes to re-enter the cell cycle.",

                                "To validate the results from RNA-seq, RT-qPCR was performed, and it was confirmed that MCT1 inhibitor treatment induced significant upregulation of genes known to promote cell cycle progression including CDK1, PLK1, TOP2A and Cyclin B (FIG. 4A). Of these genes, CDK1 activity is known to be largely regulated by post-translational modifications with differential influences on the progression of the cell cycle depending on certain phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (Obaya, A J, et al. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. C. 2002 59:126-142). Therefore, CDK1 was probed for changes in protein expression and phosphorylation. While there was no change in total CDK1 protein expression following treatment with an MCT1 inhibitor for up to 72 hr, a significant decrease in CDK1 phosphorylation at Tyr15 was observed (FIG. 4B,C). Phosphorylation of Tyr15 maintains CDK1 in an inactive state (Norbury, C, et al. EMBO J. 1991 10:3321-3329). Thus, the decrease in Tyr15 phosphorylation following AZD3965 treatment indicates an increase in the active form of CDK1, known to promote mitosis (Nigg, E A. Nat. Rev. Mol. cell Biol. 2001 2:21-32), supporting the hypothesis that MCT1 inhibition may promote adipocyte cell cycle progression and proliferation (i.e., hyperplasia).",
                                "To assess changes in adipocyte proliferation, a fluorescent DNA dye-based assay was used to determine if a change in cell number occurred following MCT1 inhibition. After 72 hr treatment, a significant increase in total cell number was observed for all concentrations of AZD3965 treatment\u22651 \u03bcM (FIG. 4D). To assess if the observed phenotype was specific to differentiated adipocytes or could be attributed to preadipocytes present in cell culture even after rigorous differentiation, proliferation assays were also performed on preadipocytes. As shown in FIG. 4E, compound treatment had no effect on proliferation in preadipocytes, confirming that the proliferation phenomenon is unique to mature adipocytes.",
                                "Further studies using confocal microscopy were conducted to capture the proliferation of MCT1 inhibitor treated mature adipocytes. Following 24 hr of 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 treatment, a significant increase in the expression of Ki67 (a widely-used marker of proliferation (Sun, X, et al. Chromosoma 2018 127:175-186)) was observed when compared to untreated adipocytes. As seen in FIG. 4H, Ki67 expression was enhanced in AZD3965 treated adipocytes as visualized by co-staining with BODIPY (a lipophilic green-fluorescent dye used to stain lipid droplets, convenient for double fluorescence labeling in adipocytes) supporting the hypothesis that MCT1 inhibition promotes re-entry into the cell cycle and subsequent proliferation of mature adipocytes. Quantification of Ki67 expression was performed by analyzing 1000 nuclei per experimental condition captured by 12 randomized images for area and intensity of Ki67 (i.e., signal in the Cy5 channel) normalized by nuclei number per image (FIGS. 4F,4G).",
                                "MCT1 Inhibition Enhances Adipocyte Glucose Uptake in a CDK1 Dependent Manner",
                                "A major metabolic benefit of inducing adipocyte hyperplasia is an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In order to evaluate the potential impact of MCT1 inhibition in mature adipocyte insulin sensitivity, alterations in glucose uptake rates were monitored. While 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 treatment had no impact on basal, non-insulin stimulated glucose uptake (FIG. 5A), there was a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake following 48 hr and 72 hr of MCT1 inhibitor treatment (FIG. 5B). Trends toward an increase in glucose uptake were also observed following 24 hr of AZD3965 treatment; however, this increase did not reach statistical significance. To determine if this effect was related to or distinct from the observed phenotype of cell cycle re-entry, the specific CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (Vassilev, L T, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 2006 103:10660-10665) was utilized. RO-3306 is known to induce growth arrest through CDK1 inhibition by preventing cells from entering mitosis. Differentiated adipocytes co-treated with RO-3306 (10 \u03bcM) and AZD3965 (1 \u03bcM) remained insulin responsive; however, the effects of AZD3965 were attenuated (FIG. 5C).",
                                "To investigate if insulin handling was modified in adipocytes with decreased MCT1 expression, 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells were differentiated and subjected to similar glucose up-take experiments. First, it was established that there were no significant differences in basal glucose uptake levels between wild type (WT), shMCT1 and shScramble cells (FIG. 5D). When stimulated with insulin, 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells showed significantly increased levels of glucose uptake indicating that these cells maintain some insulin sensitivity; however, they do not respond to insulin as robustly as WT 3T3-L1 cells or show any increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake following 72 hr treatment with 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 (FIG. 5E). To ensure that the somewhat diminished insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells is a result of MCT1 expression inhibition and not a product of the lentiviral transduction system, 3T3-L1 cells containing shScramble were also characterized. Much like WT cells, shScramble 3T3-L1 cells robustly enhanced glucose uptake following insulin stimulation and this effect was augmented by 72 hr treatment with 1 \u03bcM AZD3965 (FIG. 5F).",
                                "Finally, to test the overarching hypothesis that MCT1 inhibition could induce hyperplasia in differentiated adipocytes, changes in total triglyceride content of adipocytes cultured with or without insulin (100 nM) for 72 hr following pretreatment for up to 72 hr with or without AZD3965 (1 \u03bcM) was assessed. Cell culture media is replaced with media lacking AZD3965 prior to measuring triglycerides. In support of the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that cells pretreated with AZD3965 accumulated significantly more triglycerides than adipocytes which had not been exposed to the MCT1 inhibitor when cultured without insulin (FIG. 5G). As expected, all conditions (with or without AZD3965 pre-treatment) showed a significant increase in total triglycerides when cultured with insulin, an agent known to promote lipogenesis. However, adipocytes pretreated with AZD3965 for 48 hours and following removal of AZD3965 prior to insulin stimulation developed significantly more triglycerides than AZD3965 naive cells also cultured with insulin (FIG. 5G). Together these results suggest that AZD3965 treatment can induce hyperplasia and support an increase in lipid storage capacity.",
                                "Discussion",
                                "Obesity is associated with adipose tissue expansion and ectopic fat deposition. Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of whole-body metabolism and energy homeostasis where its primary function is to store energy in the form of lipids with glucose uptake playing a key role in providing substrates for lipogenesis (Song, Z, et al. Nutrients 2018 10:1383). In the context of positive energy balance, where nutrient intake exceeds energy expenditure, excess energetic substrates stored as triglyceride lipid droplets induce adipose tissue expansion. This expansion can occur by existing adipocytes increasing in size (hypertrophy), or by recruiting adipose progenitor cells for adipogenesis leading to an increase in adipocyte number (hyperplasia). Hence, adipocyte hypertrophy occurs to meet the demands for additional energy storage until the adipocyte reaches a critical size threshold and capacity for lipid storage (Rosen, E D, et al. Cell 2014 156:20-44). Subsequently, adipocyte progenitor cell recruitment and expansion occurs by hyperplasia to accommodate the excess until the readily available adipocyte progenitor cells are depleted. These newly formed adipocytes can also expand until they reach their hypertrophic capacity at which time excess lipids \u2018spill over\u2019 and are deposited at ectopic sites such as the liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas (Marra, F, et al. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2013 19:5250-5269).",
                                "It has been demonstrated that lean individuals predisposed to hypertrophic adipose tissue expansion have reduced insulin sensitivity (Hammarstedt, A, et al. Diabetol. Metab. Syndr. 2012 4:1-9), and that adipocyte hypertrophy is a common feature seen in non-obese patients with T2DM (Acosta, J R, et al. Diabetologia 2016 59:560-570). In \u2018metabolically fit\u2019 individuals, adipose tissue expands primarily by hyperplasia. Adipose tissue expansion through hyperplasia is associated with improved metabolic health, and as such, therapeutically targeting hyperplasia has been suggested as a potential therapy for metabolic disease (Ghaben, A L, et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. cell Biol. 2019 20:242-258). Moreover, it is well established that insulin sensitivity is directly correlative with adipocyte size, wherein, newly formed smaller adipocytes are insulin-sensitive, and hypertrophic adipocytes are often insulin resistant (Hammarstedt, A, et al. Diabetol. Metab. Syndr. 2012 4:1-9; Acosta, J R, et al. Diabetologia 2016 59:560-570).",
                                "Another important feature of adipocytes also associated with glucose uptake is the production and release of lactate (Krycer, J R, et al. Biol. Chem. 2020 295:83-98). Lactate production, utilization and signaling has extensive impacts on metabolic health, particularly in adipose tissue depots (Digirolamo, M, et al. FASEB J. 1992 6:2405-2412). Recently, it has been reported that via MCT1, the main lactate transporter in adipocytes, exogenous lactate administration can induce adipose tissue plasticity and adaptive thermogenesis (Carri\u00e8re, A, et al. J. Physiol. Biochem. 2020 76:241-250; Carri\u00e8re, A, et al. Diabetes 2014 63:3253-3265). It was demonstrated that these changes were the direct result of lactate induced redox pressure as excess lactate fuels the production of pyruvate and NADH, at the expense of NAD+. As glycolytic production of lactate and its transport via MCTs control the metabolic activity of fat cells, to gain further mechanistic insight into the influence of MCT1 activity on adipocyte biology, the classic adipocyte model cell system, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, was employed. Using this model, a combination of in vitro and transcriptomic analyses of preadipocytes and mature adipocytes treated with and without the potent and selective MCT1 small molecule inhibitor, AZD3965, was performed. Of note, AZD3965 is currently in clinical trials (NCT01791595) for the treatment of advanced cancers including diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt Lymphoma (BL). Phase I of this trial was completed in November 2020 and results regarding the safety and tolerability of AZD3965 are anticipated.",
                                "Inducing 3T3-L1 differentiation increases triglyceride synthesis, and approximately 4 days after the first exposure to differentiation medium, cells show signs of lipid accumulation. However, when 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated in the presence of a pharmacological inhibitor of MCT1 (AZD3965), cells accumulated significantly less lipid than the untreated adipocytes (FIGS. 1D, 1E); the same observation was made in the shMCT1-harboring cells (FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C), suggesting that MCT1 inhibition impairs lipid accumulation and differentiation. Exposure to differentiation media also induces transcriptional activation, and up regulation of adipogenic genes such as the transcription factor and nuclear hormone, PPAR\u03b3. PPAR\u03b3 positively regulates expression of multiple genes involved in adipogenesis including FABP4 and HSL (Deng, T, et al. Endocrinology 2006 147:875-884). FABP4 is a cytoplasmic carrier protein for fatty acids, and it has been proposed that FABP4 enables HSL activity in adipocytes by chaperoning lipids liberated by HSL-mediated lipolysis to the plasma membrane (Nielsen, T S, et al. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2014 52:R199-R222). When expression of these well-known markers of differentiation was assessed, a decrease in the expression levels of PPAR\u03b3, FABP4 and HSL was observed in AZD3965 treated and shMCT1 expressing cells corroborating the previous finding reported herein that MCT1 inhibition impairs adipocyte differentiation (FIGS. 1F, 1G).",
                                "Mature (fully differentiated) adipocytes treated with AZD3965 also exhibited reduced lipid content over the course of AZD3965 treatment (FIGS. 2A, 2B). It was posited that this decrease in lipid droplet content could be the result of a decrease in lipogenesis, an increase in lipolysis, or adipocyte de-differentiation, a process that has been described by others (Dodson, M V, et al. Int. J. stem cells 2011 4:76; Shen, J, et al. Int. J. Oral Sci. 2011 3:117-124) involving a rapid \u2018liposecretion\u2019 event (C\u00f4t\u00e9, J A, et al. Cell Tissue Res. 2019 378:385-398). To gain insight into the mechanisms that are governed by MCT1 inhibition, changes in NADP+(H) bioavailability (a critical factor for lipogenesis), intracellular glycerol content (the major product of lipolysis), adipokine secretion, as well as transcript levels and protein expression of the previously mentioned adipogenic proteins were assessed. MCT1 inhibition significantly reduced intracellular concentrations of both reduced and oxidized forms of NADP+(H), yet this decrease was marginal with a less than 15% decrease observed (FIG. 2D) suggesting that other mechanisms could contribute to the significant decrease in lipid observed following MCT1 inhibition in adipocytes (FIGS. 2A, 2B). Indeed, when AZD3965 treated adipocytes were probed for changes in lipolysis, MCT1 inhibition led to a large increase in intracellular glycerol and thus, an increase in cellular lipolysis (FIG. 2E). Although this increase in lipolysis could account for the decrease in adipocyte lipid content, it was critical to rule out the possibility of adipocyte dedifferentiation by assessing changes in transcript levels and expression of adipogenic proteins, and adipokine secretion.",
                                "RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the mRNA levels for PPAR\u03b3 and HSL were both significantly decreased following 24 hr of AZD3965 treatment (FIG. 2F). This was reflected at the protein level by a decrease in HSL protein expression following 72 hr of MCT1 inhibitor treatment; however, no changes in PPAR\u03b3 expression were observed (FIG. 2G). Conversely, FABP4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased following 24 hr and 48 hr of AZD3965 treatment, respectively (FIGS. 2F, 2G). Despite decreased HSL expression, maintained PPAR\u03b3 and elevated FABP4 expression, suggests that adipocytes remain differentiated following MCT1 inhibition. To further establish that adipocytes remained differentiated following AZD3965 treatment, conditioned media collected from adipocytes pretreated with or without AZD3965 for 72 hr were subjected to an adipokine antibody array. No significant changes in adipokine secretion following MCT1 inhibition were detected (FIG. 2H) supporting the notion that de-differentiation does not occur. Taken together, these results suggest that an increase in lipolysis following AZD3965 treatment accounts, at least in part, for the observed decrease in lipid content.",
                                "The acute physiological consequence of MCT1 inhibition is intracellular lactate accumulation owing to the cells' inability to export lactate via its primary transporter. Therefore, changes in intracellular lactate in adipocytes following incubation with AZD3965 at discrete time points ranging from 15 min to 24 hr were monitored. Indeed, treatment with the MCT1 inhibitor rapidly increased intracellular lactate; however, after prolonged exposure to AZD3965 this effect was greatly diminished (FIG. 3A). To explore the potential fates of lactate which can be metabolized through its oxidation into pyruvate or complete oxidation by the mitochondria, intracellular pyruvate and the NAD+/NADH ratio were also monitored over the same time course. An acute, significant increase in intracellular pyruvate was observed (FIG. 3B) as was a significant decrease in the relative NAD+/NADH ratio (FIG. 3C). This decrease in NAD+/NADH ratio indicates that there is an increase in intracellular lactate relative to pyruvate and that MCT1 inhibition induces reductive stress. This observation is in agreement with the finding that elevated levels of intracellular lactate also induces redox stress in adipocytes as reported by others (Carri\u00e8re, A, et al. J. Physiol. Biochem. 2020 76:241-250). Taken together, these results suggest that although there is an increase in both lactate and pyruvate, the increase in lactate is more robust; therefore, it is unlikely that excess lactate is oxidized back into pyruvate and rather, may be oxidized directly by the mitochondria.",
                                "To gain insight into the transcriptional and molecular processes influenced by MCT1 inhibition, transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) was performed on mature adipocytes treated with or without AZD3965 for 24 hr. 277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through comparison of the gene expression profiles from the treated versus untreated adipocytes. Molecular functions analysis in IPA revealed a transcriptional signature characterized by the upregulation of mRNAs related to the progression of cell cycle (FIGS. 3D, 3E). Previously, it has been suggested that mature adipocytes may retain the ability to re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Evidence of this phenomenon comes from Xu et al. who recently captured adipocyte proliferation on a phase contrast microscope (Xu, P, et al. FEBS Open Bio 2017 7:652-658). While the low resolution of these videos leaves unanswered questions as to the mechanism of proliferation (i.e., de-differentiation or direct division of adipocytes), it is clear that cells with lipid droplets do retain the capacity to divide. To explore the possibility that MCT1 inhibition could promote re-entry of the mature adipocytes into the cell cycle as suggested by our transcriptomic analysis, mRNA levels of well characterized, cell cycle promoting genes were assessed, revealing a significant increase in transcript levels of proliferation markers, CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1), PLK1 (polo-like kinase 1), TOP2\u03b1 (DNA topoisomerase alpha) and cyclin B following AZD3965 treatment (FIG. 4A). Furthermore, the active form of CDK1, a central regulator that drives cells through the cell cycle (Ding, L, et al. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020 21:1960), was found to be increased following MCT1 inhibition (FIGS. 4B, 4C).",
                                "When probed directly, it was shown that MCT1 inhibition promoted adipocyte proliferation specifically in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells, but not in preadipocytes or 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells (FIG. 4D, 4E). To visualize this proliferation, an immunocytochemistry experiment probing the expression of the proliferation marker, Ki67, following 24 hr treatment with AZD3965 was performed and quantified. Ki67 expression was observed in cells containing lipid droplets and was significantly increased in MCT1 inhibitor treated cells (FIGS. 4F, 4G, 4H). These findings strongly support the premise that mature, lipid laden adipocytes re-enter the cell cycle following MCT1 inhibition. However, it is possible that these results could represent endoreplication resulting in polyploidy, rather than proliferation. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes can become multi-nucleated (Xu, P, et al. FEBS Open Bio 2017 7:652-658).",
                                "As proliferation in mature adipocytes is a recently recognized mechanism of insulin sensitizing that accompanies hyperplasia, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was assessed following MCT1 inhibitor treatment. Following up to 72 hr of inhibitor treatment, no significant changes in basal, non-insulin stimulated glucose uptake were observed in WT 3T3-L1 cells (FIG. 5A) or shMCT1 containing 3T3-L1 cells (FIG. 5D). However, unlike shMCT1, 3T3-L1 cells showed a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake following \u226548 hr of AZD3965 (1 \u03bcM) treatment (FIGS. 5B, 5E). Moreover, it was shown that this effect was CDK1-dependent as it could be blocked with the addition of RO-3306, a small molecule CDK1 inhibitor (FIG. 5C). Evaluation of 3T3-L1-shMCT1 cells revealed that although these adipocytes are insulin responsive, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is attenuated in these cells. As shScramble expressing 3T3-L1 cells showed insulin responsiveness similar to that of WT cells (FIG. 5F), it appears that MCT1 knockdown may interfere with the development of insulin sensitive, mature adipocytes.",
                                "The ability of MCT1 inhibition to enhance adipocyte lipid storage capacity (the physiological function of hyperplasia) was assessed. To probe change in adipocyte lipid storage capacity, intracellular triglycerides were quantified in adipocytes following pretreatment with or without AZD3965 for up to 72 hr. Indeed, adipocytes exposed to the MCT1 inhibitor for 24 hr, 48 hr and 72 hr all contained significantly more triglycerides than adipocytes which had not received AZD3965 pretreatment (FIG. 5G). Moreover, when cultured for 72 hr with 100 nM insulin, a potent activator of lipogenesis, adipocytes pretreated with the MCT1 inhibitor for 48 hr accumulated significantly more triglycerides compared to adipocytes which had not been exposed to AZD3965 (FIG. 5G). Adipocytes pretreated for 24 hr and 72 hr also trended toward an increase in triglyceride content; however, this increase did not reach statistical significance. As these adipocytes were incubated with insulin, it is also possible that they may have reached their hypertrophic capacity limiting the ability of adipocytes to accumulate additional triglycerides.",
                                "Collectively, these data show that MCT1 inhibition has profound effects on adipocyte metabolism. Specifically, treatment with the MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 enhances lipolysis, promotes adipocyte proliferation, augments insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and enhances triglyceride storage capacity providing compelling evidence that MCT1 inhibition may promote adipocyte hyperplasia. However, to fully elucidate the influence that MCT1 inhibition has on systemic metabolism and the potential therapeutic benefit of AZD3965 in the context of metabolic disease, additional in vitro and in vivo experiments characterizing changes in adipose tissue morphology and metabolism, and systemic metabolism are required. As previously mentioned, AZD3965 is currently in clinical trials (NCT01791595) for advanced cancers. This trial represents the first time in patients for this class of drug to define the maximum tolerated dose and proof of mechanism. The expansion of adipose tissue mass by excessive hypertrophy and ectopic lipid accumulation are major contributors to metabolic disease in obesity. By contrast, promoting expansion of adipose tissue through hyperplasia has the potential to redistribute excess lipid between newly differentiated adipocytes with enhanced insulin sensitivity and lipid storage capacity. Thus, improving adipocyte function via MCT1 inhibition induced hyperplasia may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity and related metabolic disorders.",
