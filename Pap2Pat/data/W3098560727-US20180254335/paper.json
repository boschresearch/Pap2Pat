    "title": "Saving Moore\u2019s Law Down To 1 nm Channels With Anisotropic Effective Mass",
    "date": "2016-08-19",
    "abstract": "Scaling transistors\u2019 dimensions has been the thrust for the semiconductor industry in the last four decades. However, scaling channel lengths beyond 10 nm has become exceptionally challenging due to the direct tunneling between source and drain which degrades gate control, switching functionality, and worsens power dissipation. Fortunately, the emergence of novel classes of materials with exotic properties in recent times has opened up new avenues in device design. Here, we show that by using channel materials with an anisotropic effective mass, the channel can be scaled down to 1 nm and still provide an excellent switching performance in phosphorene nanoribbon MOSFETs. To solve power consumption challenge besides dimension scaling in conventional transistors, a novel tunnel transistor is proposed which takes advantage of anisotropic mass in both ON- and OFF-state of the operation. Full-band atomistic quantum transport simulations of phosphorene nanoribbon MOSFETs and TFETs based on the new design have been performed as a proof.",

                "The atomistic quantum transport simulation results have been obtained from the self consistent solution of 3D-Poisson equation and Non-equilibrium Green\u2019s Functions (NEGF) method using the Nanoelectronics modeling tool NEMO53031. The Poisson equation provides the potential for NEGF method and takes the free charge in return. The tight-binding Hamiltonian of phosphorene used in NEGF calculations employs a 10 bands sp3d5s* model. Phosphorene is a material with anisotropic dielectric properties. The details of the Poisson equation with anisotropic dielectric tensor and NEGF equations can be found in our previous works21223637."
