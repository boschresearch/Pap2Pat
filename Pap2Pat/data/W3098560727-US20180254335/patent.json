                        "Electronic industry development has been faithful to Moore's law as devices are becoming smaller and the number of transistors larger. For example, in 1980, INTEL's 8086 had about 50,000 transistors; in 1990, 486 had about 1,000,000 transistors; in 2000, PENTIUM4 had about 50,000,000 transistors; and in 2010, SIX-CORE 17 had about 1,000,000,000 transistors. There are two significant challenges with this ever-increasing transistor count. First, a central challenge of the electronic industry is power consumption of integrated circuits which are now composed of billions of transistors. Second, as the channel length of transistors (e.g., metal oxide semiconductors field effect transistor, MOSFET) is becoming smaller and smaller in order to increase both the operation speed and the number of transistors per chip, a phenomenon referred to as a short channel effect (SCE) becomes prominent. SCE specifically becomes problematic when the channel length is of the same order of magnitude as the depletion-layer widths. SCE manifest itself in several ways including: a subthreshold voltage roll-off (Vt roll-off), a drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and a source-drain punch through, thus increasing the inverse subthreshold slope of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and thereby significantly increasing off-state leakage current. Particularly, with off-state leakage as a measure of power performance, MOSFETs performance deteriorate progressively in submicron, deep submicron, and nano-scale channel lengths. Additionally, MOSFETs are fundamentally unable to have sharp ON-to-OFF transition, which implies that they need a relatively large operating voltage to supply the needed ON current to operate. Furthermore, the higher the desired operating speed (i.e. frequency of ON to OFF transitions), the higher the needed ON current and consequently the higher the supply voltage, hence the power consumption problem is further exasperated. Accordingly, it is essential to reduce the power consumption in chips with large numbers of transistors especially those operating at high frequencies. Therefore, a main challenge in miniaturizing MOSFETs is scaling down the supply voltage VDD, as needed to reduce power. A smaller VDD can be achieved in a switch with sharper ON to OFF transition. However, the steepness of conventional MOSFETs have a fundamental limit due to thermionic injection of carriers over the channel barrier (60 mV/decade at room temperature). The cause of this limit is also referred to as a hot carrier leakage.",
                        "Devices known as tunnel field effect transistors (TFETs) have been introduced in an attempt to address these issues. The hot carrier leakage problem does not exist in the tunnel FETs, which work based on injection of cold carriers. The doping profile of TFETs is P-i-N, unlike MOSFETs which typically use an N-i-N or P-i-P profile. Hence, the bandgap of a TFET filters out the hot carriers. TFETs are able to provide steep ON-to-OFF transitions allowing them to operate at lower voltages and significantly reduce the power consumption. However, one challenge of conventional TFETs is that the tunneling transmission probability is small, which results in small ON current levels and low speed. Moreover, scaling the channel length below 10 nm in conventional TFETs is shown to be exceedingly challenging as further length scaling significantly degrades OFF-state of conventional TFETs. Given these challenges, the Moore's law appears to be at a dead-end.",
                        "Therefore, there is an unmet need for a novel TFET design that improves upon conventional TFET current performance both in the ON- and OFF-states."

Referring to FIG. 1, a perspective exploded schematic view of a tunnel field effect transistors (TFET) 100, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is provided. The TFET 100 includes one or optionally two L-shaped gates (shown as a top gate 106 and optionally a bottom gate 112), a channel 110 (a channel is also referred to as a channel region throughout the present disclosure) disposed below the top gate 106, and source and drain regions 102 and 104, respectively (source and drain regions are also referred to as source and drain, respectively, throughout the present disclosure) at opposing ends of the channel 110.

Exemplary gate oxide materials include HfO2, SiO2, Al2O3, and other gate oxide known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. The gate typically comprises a conductive contact layer made from, e.g., Al, Cu, a transition metal such as nickel, a refractory metal such as tungsten, and metal silicides such as TiSi2, MoSi2, and WSi2, a material comprised of a combination of these layers, or other conductive material known to a person having ordinary skill in the art.

As shown in FIG. 2, the channel 110 comprises a material that has a high effective mass (high m*) along a longitudinal axis 150a-150b of the device defined from the source 102 to the drain 104 (i.e., from left to right). Conversely, the material of the channel 110 in a lateral axis 152a-152b from right to left (or bottom to top in, e.g., FIG. 3 described more fully below which is a top view of a device according to the present disclosure), the channel material has a relatively lower effective mass (low m*). The ratio between high m* and low m* can be between 1 and 50. The boundary between the source 102 and the channel 110 of the illustrated L-shaped gate TFET 100 (also herein referred to as the L-gate TFET) has an elongated portion 120 which is generally perpendicular to the low effective mass axis 152a-152b and is labeled as having a length dL in FIG. 2. In one embodiment, the channel material comprises a two-layer (2L) phosphorene nanoribbon having a zigzag structure in the high m* direction (i.e., along the longitudinal axis 150a-150b) and an armchair structure in the low m* direction (i.e., along the lateral axis 152a-152b), although other materials having anisotropic effective mass characteristics may also be used (e.g., Silicon, Germanium, and 2D materials such as titanium trisulfide (TiS3)). While the zigzag and the armchair atomistic structures are formed inherently by using phosphorene as a channel material, other materials generating differing effective mass (i.e., high m* and low m*) can also be used in which case, the structure may not be the same as zigzag and armchair. The ratio of high m* to low m* according to the present disclosure is between 1-50. In general, the channel region 110 includes one or more layers of i) 2-dimensional inherently anisotropic material made from phosphorene, titanium trisulfide, or any combination thereof; ii) 2-dimensional inherently isotropic material made from transition metal dichalcogenide including molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, molybdenum diselenide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum ditelluride, or any combination thereof; iii) 3-dimensional bulk material made from Si, germanium, gallium arsenide (GaAs), an alloy of silicon and germanium, indium phosphide, or any combination thereof, wherein the 2-dimensional inherently isotropic material and the 3-dimensional bulk material are formed to induce the first effective mass and the second effective mass by either being placed in a strained state, by structurally being formed in a manner that results in effective masses substantially different in the longitudinal and lateral axes, or by other methods known to a person having ordinary skill in the art.",

                        "The L-gate TFET of the present disclosure provides differing effective mass values for mr1* and mr2* (and therefore improved performance) as follows. Referring to FIG. 9, a top view schematic of the TFET 100 is shown again in the ON-state. In the ON-state, when a voltage is applied to the gate 106 the potential energy in the channel region is reduced such that the primary barrier of the cold carriers is the source 102 to channel junction. Because of the L-shape of the gate 106, additional carrier tunneling can occur in the low m* direction (along the lateral axis 152a-152b (see FIG. 2) of the TFET 100) as indicated by the vertical arrows shown in FIG. 9. This additional tunneling is much greater than tunneling which would otherwise be limited to that in the high m* direction (along the longitudinal axis 150a-150b (see FIG. 2) from source 102 to drain 104 of the TFET 100). In this way, ION is significantly increased.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 10, a top view schematic of the TFET 100 is shown again in the OFF-state. IOFF is also reduced, since in the OFF-state the main barrier of the carriers is the full channel region 110 itself (between the source 102 and drain 104), and the anisotropic channel material has a higher effective mass along the longitudinal axis 150a-150b (see FIG. 2) from source 102 to drain 104 of the TFET 100. This higher effective mass reduces tunneling in the OFF-state (as shown by the arrows in FIG. 10), and likewise reduces IOFF. In the OFF-state, there is some tunneling of carriers through the perpendicular portion of the source-channel barrier, but this is mostly irrelevant to IOFF since the full channel itself is the tunneling barrier and the dominating factor.",
                        "Referring back to FIG. 2, the atomic arrangement resulting in differing effective mass values mr1* and mr2*, described above, is based on two arrangements. In one arrangement in the \u201cLow m*\u201d direction (i.e., in the direction of lateral axis 152a-152 of the TFET 100) the atomic arrangement is shown as an armchair arrangement. Conversely, the second arrangement in the \u201cHigh m*\u201d direction (i.e., in the direction of longitudinal axis 150a-150b of the TFET 100) the atomic arrangement is shown as zigzag arrangement. Referring to FIG. 11, a graph of IDS (drain to source current: a measure of transistor's ON vs. OFF performance) is shown as a function of VGS (gate to source voltage) for various arrangements. These arrangements include inventors' own work for phosphorene without L-shaped channel showing 6 nm as too small of channel length as the ON-OFF current ratio for two experiments wherein the transport direction is first along the zigzag direction and second along the armchair direction each producing ION/IOFF ratio less than 104 which is a typical rule of thumb characteristic for an acceptable FET (9 nm was found to be the minimum channel length complaint with that rule of thumb). Further shown in FIG. 11 is the L-shaped channel according to the present disclosure with phosphorene as the channel material producing unexpected results where 6 nm channel length produced an ION/IOFF ratio of about 4\u00d7105 as more clearly shown in FIG. 14, described further below. As shown, the L-shaped channel has an Ion about that of the ION of a regular-shaped channel TFET device (i.e., no L-shaped channel) maximized for transport along the armchair direction (low m*), but also has an IOFF about that of the IOFF of the same regular-shaped channel device (i.e., no L-shaped channel) minimized to have transport along the armchair direction (low m*). Hence, the presently-disclosed L-gate TFET has the advantages of both low and high m* regular-shaped channel devices maximized for high ION and minimized for low IOFF, simultaneously. In FIG. 11, the dL of the channel is about 3 nm.",
                        "The performance of the L-gate TFET of the present disclosure is dependent on the differential length of the L-shaped channel (dL as shown in FIG. 3 or 6). Referring to FIG. 12, a graph of ION measured in \u03bcA/\u03bcm vs. dL measured in nm is provided. The performance of the L-gate TFET depends on the length dL which determines the width for the device ON-current (ION: the maximum current of the transistor) to flow through. In conventional prior-art TFETs, dL equals 0. FIG. 12 shows ION of one example of the presently disclosed L-gate TFET device as a function of dL for a fixed IOFF of 10\u22124 \u03bcA/\u03bcm. Increasing dL enhances ION significantly, however it reduces the source extension by dL/2. Accordingly, there is a limit on dL according to the footage requirements in the design. Nevertheless, in the illustrated example, a dL of about 2.5 nm can improve the performance of the TFET by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 13, a graph of ION measured in \u03bcA/\u03bcm vs. VGS measured in volts is provided for different channel lengths, showing examples of ultra-scaled L-gate TFETs with channel lengths from 9 nm down to 2.3 nm with a VDD of 0.2V. In ultra-scaled TFETs, VDD usually does not scale below VDD=0.2V since the maximum tunneling energy window is limited by VDD. The L-gate TFETs with Lch above 2 nm provide ION/IOFF>104 and satisfy the typical International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) requirements for the ION/IOFF ratio.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 14, a graph of ION/IOFF ratio vs. channel length is provided showing ION/IOFF ratios of instant L-gate TFETs as a function of Lch. Ultra-scaled channel lengths put a limit on dL. Hence, dL shrinks down from 3.5 nm to 1 nm when the channel length is scaled down from 9 nm to 2.3 nm. Therefore, reduction of Lch, results in reduction of dL based on a Lch/dL of about 3. L-gate TFETs with channel lengths down to 2 nm provide an ION/IOFF ratio larger than 104 (required by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) as a minimum amount of ION/IOFF ratio). Thus, the presently disclosed L-gate TFETs with a channel material with anisotropic m* enable successful scaling of TFETs down to channel lengths of only a few atoms. The square symbol and the \u201cX\u201d symbol represent the device described above in reference to FIG. 11 (i.e., the regular shaped non-L-shaped channel with Leh of 6 nm). As discussed above, these devices produced inferior ION/IOFF ratios of about 103. In FIG. 14, the IOFF was maintained at 10\u22124 \u03bcA/\u03bcm.",
                        "The process by which the TFET devices of the present disclosure are made are based on typical MOSFET fabrication processes, known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. When the channel material is a 2-D type material, an exemplary transfer process for these 2D material is found in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 20120061728 for Javey, incorporated by reference in its entirety into the present disclosure.
