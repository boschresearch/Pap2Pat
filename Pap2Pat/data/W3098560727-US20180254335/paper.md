# Methods

The atomistic quantum transport simulation results have been obtained from the self consistent solution of 3D-Poisson equation and Non-equilibrium Green’s Functions (NEGF) method using the Nanoelectronics modeling tool NEMO53031. The Poisson equation provides the potential for NEGF method and takes the free charge in return. The tight-binding Hamiltonian of phosphorene used in NEGF calculations employs a 10 bands sp3d5s* model. Phosphorene is a material with anisotropic dielectric properties. The details of the Poisson equation with anisotropic dielectric tensor and NEGF equations can be found in our previous works21223637.
