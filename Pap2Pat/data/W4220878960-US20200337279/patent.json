    "abstract": "This disclosure provides new animal models for studying Usher syndrome and developing new therapy. The technology is implemented in pigs, and other large animals in which the ophthalmic architecture and function more closely resembles architecture and function of the human eye. The animals have a genetic modification in which all or a portion of a human gene known to cause Usher syndrome in human patients replaces the host gene. Animals can be cloned or bred to be homozygous at the targeted locus, whereupon they manifest symptoms and signs of Usher syndrome. Since a substantial portion of the targeted gene has been humanized, the animals can be used to develop and test pharmacological agents such as gene therapy that are sequence dependent.",

                        "Every day, people all over the world are slowly losing their sight due to the genetic disorder known as Usher syndrome. The real tragedy is that these people have already lost their hearing, and struggle to maintain their balance (Usher 2020 Foundation). In spite of these challenges, people with Usher syndrome are fully capable, both intellectually and emotionally. Less than 25% of young people with Usher syndrome show evidence of mental or behavioral impairment. It is estimated that Usher syndrome affects between 25,000 and 40,000 people in the United States, and as many as 400,000 around the world.",
                        "Hearing impairment in USH is caused by abnormal development of hair cells in the inner ear. Children with Usher syndrome are usually born with moderate to profound hearing loss, caused by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). It manifests initially as night-blindness and a loss of peripheral vision because of progressive degeneration of cells in the retina. As RP progresses, the field of vision narrows until only tunnel vision remains. Macular holes and cataracts may also occur, leading to an early decline in central vision.",
                        "Usher syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. It has a heterogeneous presentation, because it is a consequence of mutations to any one of at least 12 different genes (Wolfrum 2011; Mathur and Yang 2015; Wolfrum et al. 2018). There are three types (USH1, USH2, and USH3), and other less typical forms. USH1 is the most severe type, characterized by profound hearing loss starting at birth, vestibular areflexia, and pre-pubertal onset of vison loss.",
                        "Currently there is no cure for Usher syndrome in any of its forms. Treatment is generally limited to the management of hearing, vision, and balance problems. Early diagnosis helps the managing clinician tailor educational programs to the severity of hearing and vision loss and a child's age and ability. Treatment may include the use of hearing aids, assistive listening devices, and cochlear implants. Unfortunately, retinal degeneration in USH1 is an irreversible process, resulting in impaired vision starting in childhood, which leads to complete blindness by the third decade of life."

In the hair cells, the USH protein networks are essential for the correct differentiation of the hair bundles as well as for the function of the mechano-electrical transduction complex in the matured cell. In the photoreceptor cells, USH proteins are located in the ciliary region and participate in intracellular transport processes. In addition, a USH protein network is present in the so-called calyceal processes.",

Two research groups have been working with mouse models for USH type 1B, caused by mutations in the myosin VIIa (MYO7A) gene to test lentiviral vector gene therapy (Hashimoto et al., Zallocchi et al.). In the second study, the vector protected the photoreceptors of the transgenic mouse from acute and chronic intensity light damage, indicated by a significant reduction in photoreceptor cell loss, and restoration of the \u03b1-transducin translocation threshold in the photoreceptors. There are also models for USH in zebrafish (Blanco-Sanchez B et al.) and rats (Held N. et al).",

For example, all or part of the endogenous gene (for example, an exon, with or without flanking and/or internal non-encoding regions) is replaced with the corresponding potion of the corresponding, including a mutation that is thought to cause Usher syndrome when homozygous in humans.

Animal cloning, or somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can be performed according to standard methods, as described in GB 2318578 and GB 2331751 (Roslin Institute). A nuclear donor cell is inserted into a suitable recipient cell, such as an enucleated oocyte. Alternatively, to the extent that is technically feasible, a genetically modified parental donor cell can be epigenetically reprogrammed into a viable zygote. EP 2121902; Chung, Lanza et al. (2009), Cloning and Stem Cells 11(2).",
                                "Before the nuclear transfer or reprogramming, the genetically modified parental cell is produced using a suitable genetic engineering vector. For example, insertion of transgenes can be accomplished using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or a P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC). The vector containing the transgene to be inserted is introduced into the parental cell, whereupon insertion into the host genome is promoted: for example, by homologous recombination, or using a gene editing tool, such as the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system or a transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN). As illustrated below, the parental cell may be co transfected with the BAC vector together with plasmids encoding gRNA and Cas9.",
                                "Clones containing the appropriately modified gene are then identified and retrieved. By including a drug resistance gene in the vector (a means for clonal selection, such as a neomycin resistant gene), genetically modified cells can be selected, and then genotyped. In this case, the drug resistant gene is preferably placed in the gene vector with a means for removing it later: such as a loxP site on either side. Once parental cells with the appropriate modification of the USH gene is identified and selected, the drug resistance gene is removed (for example, using a Cre recombinase vector). Genotyping to identify properly modified genes can be performed, for example, by qPCR-based loss-of-wild-type-allele (LOWA) analysis.",

AAV-mediated gene addition of the cDNA of the normal gene is currently the most advanced therapeutic strategy for ocular disorders (discussed in May-Simera et al. 2017). The pig eye with a size close to the human eye allows not only the evaluation of the efficacy of a specific AAV vector but also the application routes, namely injections in the subretinal space, into the vitreus or systemic application.",

USH1CR31X/R31X pigs bear a disease causing nonsense mutation, which generate premature termination codons that cause premature translational termination of the mRNA, and subsequently inhibit normal full-length protein expression. These nonsense mutations are very common in retinal dystrophy genes but also in other monogenic diseases (up to 30%). Translational read-through (TR) therapy is a gene-based therapeutic approach for genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations has emerged (Nagel-Wolfrum et al. 2016). TR therapy is based on small molecules, known as TR-inducing drugs (TRIDs), that allow suppression of the nonsense codon resulting in full-length protein synthesis. A pig model according to this disclosure can be used to evaluate TRIDs efficacy, and for testing of delivery routes.",
