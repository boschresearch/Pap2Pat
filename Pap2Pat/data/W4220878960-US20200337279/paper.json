    "abstract": "Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of monogenic deaf-blindness. Loss of vision is untreatable and there are no suitable animal models for testing therapeutic strategies of the ocular constituent of USH, so far. By introducing a human mutation into the harmonin-encoding USH1C gene in pigs, we generated the first translational animal model for USH type 1 with characteristic hearing defect, vestibular dysfunction, and visual impairment. Changes in photoreceptor architecture, quantitative motion analysis, and electroretinography were characteristics of the reduced retinal virtue in USH1C pigs. Fibroblasts from USH1C pigs or USH1C patients showed significantly elongated primary cilia, confirming USH as a true and general ciliopathy. Primary cells also proved their capacity for assessing the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene repair or gene therapy in vitro. AAV-based delivery of harmonin into the eye of USH1C pigs indicated therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",

                "Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of inherited deaf\u2010blindness in humans (Mathur & Yang, 2015). USH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with at least 10 genes assigned to three clinical USH types (Moller et\u00a0al, 1989; Toms et\u00a0al, 2020). The most severe of them is USH1, characterized by profound hearing loss from birth on, vestibular areflexia, and pre\u2010pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In patients, the congenital sensorineural hearing impairment can be compensated with cochlear implants, but no therapeutic option is presently available for the ocular disease constituent. Thus, most USH cases lead to severe visual impairment and blindness over time, adding a substantial psychological component to the clinical symptoms (Lonborg\u2010Moller et\u00a0al, 2020).",
                "Development of therapies and understanding of USH pathogenesis in the retina is arduous as existing rodent models for USH reflect the human deficits in the inner ear, but show only a very mild, if any, retinal phenotype (Lentz et\u00a0al, 2007; Williams, 2008; El\u2010Amraoui & Petit, 2014). This has been attributed to substantial differences between mouse and human in anatomy and cellular composition of the retina and stimulated discussion about alternative model species. Pigs reflect structure and function of the human eye much better than mice as they have a similar size, a comparable rod/cone ratio and a cone\u2010rich region, the so\u2010called visual streak (Chandler et\u00a0al, 1999; Hendrickson & Hicks, 2002). Specifically, calyceal processes (CP), cellular extravaginations at the transition of the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS) of photoreceptor cells (PRC) appear in many species, including human and pig, but not rodents (Wolfrum et\u00a0al, 2010; Sahly et\u00a0al, 2012; El\u2010Amraoui & Petit, 2014). Various pig models have been described for retinal degeneration, with the majority of them induced by compounds or light (Li et\u00a0al, 2009; Wang et\u00a0al, 2011; Mon\u00e9s et\u00a0al, 2016) or additive transgenesis (Petters et\u00a0al, 1997; Sommer et\u00a0al, 2011; Ross et\u00a0al, 2012; Kostic et\u00a0al, 2013). As the latter do not truly reflect the genetic constellation in patients, the phenotype was, however, difficult to interpret and limited the utility of these models.",
                "We therefore hypothesized that introducing a patient\u2010specific mutation into a partially humanized USH1C gene would facilitate a better genotype\u2013phenotype correlation of an USH1C pig model. USH1C comprises 28 exons with alternative splicing giving rise to numerous transcript variants (Zwaenepoel et\u00a0al, 2001; preprint: Nagel\u2010Wolfrum et\u00a0al, 2021). According to their domain composition, the transcripts are classified into the three protein subgroups harmonin_a, _b, and _c (Verpy et\u00a0al, 2000; Sahly et\u00a0al, 2012). Most characteristic for harmonin are several PDZ domains (Kim and Sheng 2004). N\u2010harm and CC (coiled\u2010coil) domains are further integral constituents of all harmonin variants, while only harmonin_b comprises a second CC as well as a PST (proline\u2010serine\u2010threonine rich) domain (Verpy et\u00a0al, 2000; Boeda et\u00a0al, 2002; preprint: Nagel\u2010Wolfrum et\u00a0al, 2021). A gene therapy approach in the inner ear of a murine Ush1c model demonstrated the physiological relevance of distinct isoforms: harmonin_a1 appeared sufficient for restoring the vestibular system while only harmonin_b1 corrected deficits in the auditory function (Pan et\u00a0al, 2017). The specific relevance of harmonin_b variants for hearing is also illustrated by mutations in the CC2 or the PST domain, causing autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB18A) rather than USH in human patients (Ouyang et\u00a0al, 2002) or in a naturally occurring deaf\u2010circler mouse line (Johnson et\u00a0al, 2003). In contrast, USH\u2010causing mutations are located in the common N\u2010harm, PDZ, or CC1 domains (Fuster\u2010Garcia et\u00a0al, 2021).",
                "The components of the USH1 and USH2 interactome are the main, but not exclusive interaction partners of harmonin (Reiners & Wolfrum, 2006; Mathur & Yang, 2015). The mutual interplay of USH proteins and the molecular properties of harmonin, however, remain elusive. In the inner ear, harmonin serves in the formation and functionality of the interstereociliary links in the bundles protruding from cochlear hair\u2009cells (El\u2010Amraoui & Petit, 2005; Richardson et\u00a0al, 2011). Harmonin is also consistently localized to the ribbon synapses of hair cells and PRCs (Reiners et\u00a0al, 2005; Williams et\u00a0al, 2009a; Gregory et\u00a0al, 2011), whereas data on harmonin abundance in other compartments of the retina are contradictory in rodents (Reiners et\u00a0al, 2003, 2005; Williams et\u00a0al, 2009a; Sahly et\u00a0al, 2012). In species with pronounced CP structures in PRC such as amphibians or primates, however, USH proteins, including harmonin, seem to co\u2010localize with CP or, at least, appear in the transition zone of IS to OS (Sahly et\u00a0al, 2012; Schietroma et\u00a0al, 2017). Very recently, we detected harmonin also in the OS of rods, in M\u00fcller glia cells (MGC), and in the outer limiting membrane of the human retina at the adhesive junctions between MGC and PRC (preprint: Nagel\u2010Wolfrum et\u00a0al, 2021).",
                "Based on these considerations, we designed and generated an USH1C pig model, carrying the deleterious c.C91T/p.R31X non\u2010sense mutation after humanization of exon 2 and its surrounding intronic sequences in the porcine USH1C gene. For the integration of exon 2 in the major splice variants USH1C_a, _b, and _c, the chosen mutation will affect all relevant USH1C transcripts and its disruption was, therefore, proposed to cause the full spectrum of USH. USH1C pigs revealed profound hearing impairment, pronounced vestibular dysfunction, and significant visual deficits. At the cellular level, the retinal phenotype was characterized by an early disruption of OS photosensitive disc architecture, elongated connecting cilia, and narrower cone synapses. Primary cells from USH1C pigs were sufficient for in\u00a0vitro testing of human\u2010specific gene repair or gene therapy. The latter approach did also restore retinal function in an in\u00a0vivo pilot study."

                        "First, we assessed the translational potential of an USH pig model by examining the harmonin proteins and the underlying genetic USH1C structure across mammalian species. With the exception of a few small segments in the coding regions, harmonin shows an outstandingly high degree of conservation between the species (Fig\u20091A). Extended CCCTC\u2010binding protein (CTCF)/cohesin\u2010binding regions suggest that exons undergoing complex splicing are controlled by distantly located chromosomal segments in cis (Holwerda & de Laat, 2013; Ghirlando & Felsenfeld, 2016) rather than by local regulatory elements (Fig\u20091B). In contrast, a 1.5\u2009kb segment comprising exon 2 and its surrounding intronic regions were predicted to be relevant in gene regulation (Fig\u20091C). Conservation is noticeable throughout the entire region, culminating in a 100% identity among all amino acid positions encoded by exon 2 in all examined species (Fig\u20091D). We therefore modified the porcine USH1C gene by a corresponding 1.5\u2009kb element including a disruptive c.C91T/p.R31X nonsense mutation (Zwaenepoel et\u00a0al, 2001) as well as 3 intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified on the disease allele of a human USH1C patient. A modification vector was produced by bacterial recombineering out of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) covering the porcine USH1C locus and combined with CRISPR/Cas components to introduce the desired modification in pig primary cells (Fig\u2009EV1A\u2013C and Appendix\u00a0Fig S1A\u2013D).",
                        "Following previous attempts to generate pig models (Kurome et\u00a0al, 2015; Vochozkova et\u00a0al, 2019), single\u2010cell clones (SSCs) were generated from primary cells, nucleofected with the modification components, and screened for the desired modification (Fig\u2009EV1E and Appendix\u00a0Fig S1E and F). Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) was used for establishing founder animals from verified genetically modified SSCs (Fig\u2009EV1D). Female cell clones with both USH1C alleles modified were further lipofected with Cre\u2010mRNA in order to excise the selection cassette prior to their usage in SCNT experiments (Fig\u2009EV1F). Out of 12 embryo transfers, 4 litters were produced, delivering a total of 18 piglets. Genetic analysis confirmed excision of the neo cassette in 5 out of 15 founder animals, constituting a remnant single lox site in intron 1 (Fig\u2009EV1G and H), the humanized fragment (Fig\u2009EV1I) as well as the correct conjunction of the modification to the porcine sequence at the 3\u2032\u2010end of the modification in the animals (Appendix\u00a0Fig S1G).",
                        "Strikingly, all cloned founder animals showed a pronounced circling phenotype at birth (Movie EV1), correlating with a dysfunctional vestibular system (Ernest et\u00a0al, 2000; Johnson et\u00a0al, 2003). For this reason, animals were raised in a rescue deck from birth on (Egerer et\u00a0al, 2018). After 48\u201372\u2009h of interval feeding by hand, circling essentially ceased and USH1C piglets were able to feed themselves from the nurturing unit. We interpret this as central vestibular compensation and re\u2010weighting of multisensory input to the balance system.",
                        "In general, USH1C pigs developed and acted normally, but stress\u2010induced circling proved a consistent hallmark in the case animals found themselves challenged by new situations. At an age of 3\u20136\u2009months, we occasionally observed a spontaneous nystagmus of the eyes (Movie EV2) in some animals. This is very likely caused by an asymmetrical tonic firing of vestibular afferents from the right and left labyrinth (Baloh et\u00a0al, 2012; Dougherty et\u00a0al, 2020) and has been anecdotally described in USH patients (Moller et\u00a0al, 1989; Bonneau et\u00a0al, 1993). 8\u2010month\u2010old USH1C pigs were fertile and 3 sows became pregnant after insemination with wild\u2010type (WT) sperm and gave birth to F1 litters, comprising heterozygous offspring (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2A). F2 USH1C piglets were produced by mating F1 animals with each other or by inseminating of the cloned founder sows with sperm from one of their heterozygous offspring. In all USH1C offspring, a circling phenotype appeared as it had been observed in the F0 generation produced by SCNT. During breeding, it became obvious that some of the founder animals carried two distinct mutations of the USH1C alleles. One constituted the c.C91T/p.R31X mutation, while the other was a large genomic disruption, deleting exon 2 of the USH1C gene (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2B). Genomic evaluation by endpoint PCR and qPCR and transcriptional analysis of heterozygous animals confirmed this hypothesis (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2C and D and Appendix\u00a0Fig S3). Details on animals used for experimental and breeding purposes are shown in Appendix\u00a0Table\u2009S1."

                        "To quantify changes in visually guided behavior, animals were challenged in distinct settings. In a barrier course in which animals had to bypass vertical shields to reach a food bowl (Barone et\u00a0al, 2018), USH1C pigs did not show obvious differences to WT controls regarding duration or gait instability (Movies EV3, EV4 and Fig\u20092A and Appendix\u00a0Fig S4). Interestingly, however, USH1C animals hesitated to enter the course in the dark (average 2.9 lux), turned around more often within the course, and had more frontal contacts with obstacles than WT control animals while these differences were less pronounced under light conditions. A more complex obstacle course was carried out on a cohort of 5 USH1C and 5 age\u2010matched WT controls. Over an age of 7\u201312\u2009months, animals had to repeatedly walk through a parcour in which they had to cross or bypass distinctly shaped hurdles in varying constellations (Movies EV5, EV6 and Appendix\u00a0Fig S5). In the dark (0.1\u201312 lux), USH1C pigs had significantly more contacts with hurdles, while their speed was similar to WT (Fig\u20092B and Appendix\u00a0Fig S6). In the light (50\u2013150 lux), USH1C pigs did not only touch hurdles more often, but were also significantly slower than WT controls. Plotting the data points for individual animals supported the interpretation of a general difference between USH1C pigs and WT control animals (Appendix\u00a0Fig S7). Remarkably, USH1C pigs had difficulties to pass hurdles taking a pronounced vertical movement and therefore requiring balance (such as the red cavaletti) as well as obstacles challenging stereopsis and peripheral vision (such as the hanging or standing blue barrel and the step board) (Fig\u20092C). While the interpretation of an impaired vestibular system was further supported by the clearly different gait pattern in USH1C pigs (Movies EV5 and EV6), the interpretation of a reduced visual function in these animals was corroborated by a more detailed analysis of the movement in the obstacle course (Fig\u20092D). It became obvious that USH1C pig trajectories were longer (TrajLength and TrajDistance) compared to WT, with more frequently abrupt changes in direction (lower Emax). In addition, they took more time to complete the course (TrajDuration) while their step length was shorter."

                        "Auditory brainstem response (ABR) documented severe hearing deficits in USH1C pigs as early as 3\u2009weeks and up to 2\u2009years of age, indicated by a lack of response even upon click stimulus at sound pressure levels of up to 120\u2009dB sound pressure level (SPL) (Figs\u20093A and Fig\u2009EV2). The findings of sensorineural hearing loss (Cvejic et\u00a0al, 2009) correlated with changes in the arrangement of hair cell cilial bundles and the lack of stereocilia in inner ear hair cells (Fig\u2009EV2B), as well as with the findings in Ush1c mouse models (Johnson et\u00a0al, 2003; Lefevre et\u00a0al, 2008) and the congenital deafness in human patients (Koenekoop et\u00a0al, 1993). The hearing threshold of heterozygous USH1C+/\u2212 pigs was slightly elevated compared to WT littermates at distinct ages (Figs\u20093A and EV2E and F). Hearing thresholds for both WT and heterozygous animals slightly declined with increasing test frequency, while thresholds in USH1C animals deteriorated further for higher frequencies. In line with their profound sensorineural hearing loss, USH1C piglets did not react on their mother\u00b4s call for nourishing (Movie EV7). Most of them needed nudging for waking up, while heterozygous littermates arrived at their mother within 15\u2009s (Fig\u20093A). Consistently, some USH1C piglets were within the faster group, presumably awoken from being sideswiped by their littermates.",
                        "Clinical examination of the eyes in USH1C pigs at 1\u2009year of age revealed changes comparable to early stages of USH in human patients. A reduction of cone photoreceptor function was evident in the central visual streak area analyzed by multifocal electro\u2010retinography (ERG, Fig\u20093B and C). Both rod and cone photoreceptor cell (PRC) responses were markedly attenuated in USH1C pigs compared to age\u2010matched wild\u2010type animals at 12\u2009months of age (Fig\u20093D and Appendix\u00a0Fig S8). USH1C animals showed >\u200970% reduction in the scotopic standard flash a\u2010wave amplitude ([mean value\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 21\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009\u00b5V in USH1C vs. 79\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009\u00b5V in WT animals) and a >\u200950% reduction in scotopic b\u2010wave amplitude (75\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u2009\u00b5V in USH1C vs. 154\u2009\u00b1\u200939\u2009\u00b5V in WT animals). Responses after photopic standard flash stimuli showed a 50% reduction of a\u2010wave amplitude ([mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD] 10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009\u00b5V in USH1C vs. 20\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009\u00b5V in WT animals) and a 60% reduction in the respective b\u2010wave amplitude (86\u2009\u00b1\u200949\u2009\u00b5V in USH1C vs. 215\u2009\u00b1\u200950\u2009\u00b5V in WT animals). Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) of the retina and choroid layer showed no differences between WT and USH1C pigs (Appendix\u00a0Fig S9). Interestingly, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Fig\u20093E) revealed only minor differences in retinal architecture between WT and USH1C pigs with good preservation of outer retinal layers containing the PRCs, suggesting a large therapeutic window."

                        "Previous studies of USH1C/harmonin expression, particularly in the mouse retina, were inconsistent but indicated localization of harmonin in PRC, MGC, and secondary retinal neurons. (Reiners et\u00a0al, 2003; Reiners & Wolfrum, 2006; Williams et\u00a0al, 2009b; Sahly et\u00a0al, 2012). In WT pigs, we detected harmonin in the PRC layer, the outer limiting membrane (OLM) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) (Appendix\u00a0Fig\u2009EV3). More specifically, the protein was found in the PRC outer segment (OS), the OS base, in calyceal processes (CP) and synaptic pedicles. Harmonin abundance in MGC microvilli tips and the cell adhesion region of the OLM is in line with expression profiles and subcellular localization of harmonin in the human retina (preprint: Nagel\u2010Wolfrum et\u00a0al, 2021). In both, USH1C and WT pigs, USH1C transcripts were detected in multiple but not all organs (Fig\u20094A and B). Sanger sequencing confirmed correct splicing of the humanized exon 2 in USH1C pigs (Appendix\u00a0Fig S10A and B). While in some tissues (colon, duodenum), RT\u2013PCR indicated considerable proportions of transcripts lacking exon 13 (Fig\u20094C), splicing out of exons 13 or 14 appeared only at very low levels in the retina (Appendix\u00a0Fig S10C). USH1C_b splice variants were found at low level in general, but clearly indicated a lack of exon 27 in all transcripts and alternative splicing of exon 20 (Appendix\u00a0Fig S10D and E). We did not detect transcripts without exon 11, a core characteristic of USH1C_c, indicating that USH1C_a1 is the dominant transcript of USH1C in the pig retina. At the protein level, harmonin was consistently lacking in Western blot analysis (Fig\u20094D) and in tissue sections (Fig\u20094E), confirming the sufficient suppression of harmonin translation by the premature R31X nonsense mutation. No changes were observed in protein levels of SANS (encoded by USH1G), whirlin (encoded by WHRN (USH2D)), and myosin VIIa (encoded by MYO7A (USH1B)) in the retina (Fig\u20094F). In contrast, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was considerably upregulated in the USH1C retina already at an age of 3\u2009weeks (Fig\u20095A and B), suggesting gliosis, a phenomenon often seen in inherited retinal diseases (Hippert et\u00a0al, 2015) or injury\u2010mediated degradation processes (Bringmann et\u00a0al, 2009).",
                        "While the general structure of the retina appeared grossly intact in USH1C pigs (Figs\u20094E and EV3G, and Appendix\u00a0Fig S9), subcellular analysis revealed specific disruptions in the architecture of compartments containing harmonin. In line with its proposed scaffold function in ribbon synapses (Gregory et\u00a0al, 2013), the loss of harmonin results in significantly reduced extension of the cone synaptic pedicles. This was confirmed by both the quantitative determination of cone\u2010specific peanut agglutinin (PNA) stretches at synapses (Fig\u20095C) and the direct measurement of synapse width in transmission\u2010electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig\u20095D). We also found significant increases in length of the connecting cilium (CC) in rod PRCs, as determined by quantitative measurements of the ciliary marker GT335 stretches (Fig\u20096A\u2013C) as well as by direct examination of TEM ultrathin sections (Fig\u20096D and E). Aiming at identifying a consistent relevance of harmonin for cilia formation, we examined primary cilia in dermal fibroblast of USH1C and WT in pigs and humans (Fig\u20096F). While the number of ciliated cells in USH1C pigs was reduced compared to WT (Fig\u20096G), the length of the primary cilia was consistently elongated in fibroblasts isolated from USH1C pigs and a USH1CR31X/R80fs patient after induction of ciliogenesis (Fig\u20096G and H). Most striking, however, was the deprivation of rod OS architecture in PRC. While this is normally characterized by a strictly horizontal stacking of parallel photosensitive membrane discs (Fig\u20096I) (Sjostrand, 1953), we detected vertically orientated membrane discs (Fig\u20096J) in animals as early as 3\u2009weeks of age. This aberrant structuring became even more prominent at 12\u2009months when the stacking of discs was further infringed by interstitial gaps and vesicle\u2010like structures at the OS base (Fig\u20096K\u2013M). In contrast to rods, the OS architecture in cones remained normal throughout the first year of life (Fig\u2009EV3G)."

                        "Besides its usage in studying disease progression and its underlying mechanisms, the USH1C pig will also support the development of novel treatment approaches. The defined genetic cause of the model, the disruption of exon 2, affects all relevant USH1C splice forms and, therefore, facilitates the testing of a broad spectrum of treatment options. We addressed fundamental questions by examining the tropism of distinct serotypes of adeno\u2010associated viruses (AAV) for transducing cells of the retina in\u00a0vivo, by testing the gene therapy and gene repair approaches in\u00a0vitro and by exploring the potential to restore eye function in\u00a0vivo after sub\u2010retinal injection of AAV expressing USH1C mRNA.",
                        "For testing the distribution of AAV vectors, defined amounts (200\u2009\u00b5l, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20091010\u2009vg/eye) of established AAV8, AAV9, or a modified Anc80 vectors, each of them expressing eGFP under control of a CMV promoter (Vandenberghe et\u00a0al, 2013; Carvalho et\u00a0al, 2018), were injected into the sub\u2010retinal space of the eye in WT pigs followed by examination of eGFP expression after 5\u2009weeks. While AAV8 transduced only PRCs efficiently, AAV9 and Anc80 transduced both, PRC and MGC (Fig\u20097A, lower panel). Anc80 was much less effective in transducing cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) than AAV9 and, in particular, than AAV 8 (Appendix\u00a0Fig S11), indicating that the target specificity in the eye can be controlled by the appropriate choice of the AAV capsid. No relevant other off\u2010target expression of eGFP was noted for the tested AAVs.",
                        "The capability for correcting the causative USH1CR31X  mutation in the humanized exon 2 by CRISPR/Cas\u2010mediated gene repair was evaluated by applying distinct constellations of human\u2010specific gRNA and repair oligo\u2010nucleotides into pig primary kidney cells (PKCs), isolated from USH1C founder animals (Figs\u20097B and EV4). The efficacy of transforming the nonsense codon TGA into an Arginin\u2010encoding CGA by homology\u2010directed repair (HDR) reached 40%, determined in DNA preparations from mixed cell clones. Upon clonal selection, the analysis of 68 single cell clones (SSCs) confirmed that 40% of the clones underwent gene correction, while non\u2010homologous end\u2010joining (NHEJ) was seen in 31% of the SSCs. Occasionally, HDR was accompanied by additional mutations, either small insertions/deletions or single nucleotide exchanges. For the specific positioning of the gRNA, a considerable proportion of mutations that appear in intron 2 would not affect the correct transcription and translation of USH1C.",
                        "For exploring the potential of harmonin restoration by gene therapy, we transfected a vector encoding the human harmonin_a1 splice variant into primary skin fibroblasts derived from USH1C pigs. By using the number of ciliated cells as well as the length of the primary cilium as therapeutic readout (Fig\u20096G and H), we confirmed that treated fibroblasts differed significantly from untreated USH1C cells and reached the levels determined in WT fibroblasts for both parameters (Fig\u20097C).",
                        "The potential to compensate for the lack of harmonin in USH1C pigs was explored by applying a volume of 200\u2009\u00b5l, 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091011\u2009vg Anc80.CMV.harmonin_a1 vector into the sub\u2010retinal space of one eye while the other eye was sham\u2010treated with PBS. In one 3.5\u2010year\u2010old USH1C pig, we detected harmonin in histological sections and in Western blot after 12\u2009months in the treated eye (Fig\u20097D). Furthermore, amplitudes of the a\u2010 and b\u2010waves were significantly increased in the scotopic and photopic ERG, compared to the sham\u2010treated eye, similarly to another animal that was treated accordingly at an age of 3.5\u2009years and examined after 3\u2009months (Figs\u20097D and EV5)."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Combining hearing deficits, vestibular dysfunction, and vision loss, the USH1C pig is the first animal model to reflect the full syndromic phenotype in human USH1 patients. The early onset of symptoms makes it suitable for studying the basic mechanisms of the disease as well as for evaluating strategies of therapeutic intervention. The persistence of a largely intact retinal architecture throughout the first year of life provides a wide therapeutic window and the potential to revert the pathogenesis by targeting dysfunctional, but still viable photoreceptor cells. The specific design of the genetic modification allows the examination of a broad diversity of therapies, including classical additive gene therapy, human\u2010specific gene repair, and translational read\u2010through or cell replacements. The establishment of breeding populations (Appendix\u00a0Fig S2), the provision of distinct therapeutic options in\u00a0vitro and the success of AAV\u2010based delivery of harmonin in exploratory experiments in\u00a0vivo (Figs\u20097, EV4, and EV5) collectively demonstrate the potential of the model for evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Consequently, USH1C pigs can now be used for systematic pre\u2010clinical examination in\u00a0vivo, similar to recent ventures in genetically engineered pig models (Langin et\u00a0al, 2018; Regensburger et\u00a0al, 2019; Moretti et\u00a0al, 2020). In such studies, housing USH1C pigs under standardized conditions will minimize environmental confounding, whereas the pronounced genetic diversity of conventionally produced pigs needs consideration. While presenting a statistical challenge for pre\u2010clinical proof\u2010of\u2010principle studies, this heterogeneity is, of course, much more likely to reflect the scenario in clinical trials and might thus lead to a more robust predictive power of the model in the translation of new therapeutic strategies (Ebermann et\u00a0al, 2010).",
                "The manifestation of an ocular phenotype in USH1C pigs is striking, taking into account the multiple efforts that have been made in creating such models in other species with so limited success (Williams, 2008). Our results reinforce some of the multiple sentiments that have been postulated as reasons for the lack of a vision phenotype in rodents. The onset of retinal dysfunction in pigs within the first year of life argues against the notion that the limited life span of mice prevents the developing of a similar phenotype in the mouse eye. While a potentially distinct function of the USH proteins in the retinae of different species cannot be readily excluded, the degree of sequence conservation of harmonin and its immediate interaction partners is remarkable (Fig\u20091 and Appendix\u00a0Fig S12), insinuating a conserved and consistent nature of the USH1 interactome across species.",
                "Crucially, porcine harmonin appears to be localized to CP (Fig\u2009EV3D) which is thought to stabilize the OS structure in the PRC of different species, although not in rodents (El\u2010Amraoui & Petit, 2014). A recent publication demonstrated the absence of CP in cone PRCs and a pronounced outgrowth of disc membranes at the base of rod OS upon partial knock\u2010down of the USH1F\u2010encoded protein pcdh15 in the clawed toad (Schietroma et\u00a0al, 2017). While the complete lack of harmonin in pig did neither show outgrowth of disc membranes nor affect the formation of CP to a similar extent, it explicitly disturbed the photosensitive disc architecture in rods (Fig\u20096I\u2013N). Considering the actin\u2010binding properties of harmonin, the changes in disc architecture and CC dimensions (Fig\u20096A\u2013E) link the retinal pathology in USH1C pigs to the proposed role of the actin cytoskeleton as driving force in disc neogenesis and in the structural maintenance of the PRC OS (Corral\u2010Serrano et\u00a0al, 2020; Spencer et\u00a0al, 2020). Specifically, ciliogenesis has been shown altered upon dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton at a molecular level (Kim et\u00a0al, 2015), an effect that has been also associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Karam et\u00a0al, 2015). The consistent elongation of CC in PRC and primary cilia in dermal fibroblasts (Figs\u20096 and 7C) further confirms the tight interaction of the ciliary actin system with axonemal microtubules in PRCs (Wolfrum & Schmitt, 2000; Corral\u2010Serrano et\u00a0al, 2020) and the general role of the actin system in the organization of ciliary axonemes (Kiesel et\u00a0al, 2020). Although precise mechanistic insights into the role of harmonin in cilia function require further studies, our data provide clear evidence that USH is a true retinal ciliopathy in its fundamental aspects (Bujakowska et\u00a0al, 2017).",
                "Remarkably, the significantly disturbed photosensitive disc architecture in rod OSs and the ciliary aberrations (Fig\u20096) are associated with a significant (c. 70%) reduction in rod\u2010derived ERG responses (Fig\u20093D). The apparent decline in cone\u2010derived ERG (c. 50%) and the reduced width of cone synaptic pedicles (Fig\u20095C and D) indicate the early onset of cone\u2010specific alterations as well. Both, structural and clinical observations thus support the notion of a rod\u2010cone dystrophy phenotype in USH1C pigs, reflecting the situation in human patients quite well (Koenekoop et\u00a0al, 1993; Khateb et\u00a0al, 2020). The early onset of PRC malfunction was in line with the up\u2010regulation of GFAP in MGC (Fig\u20095A and B) and with reports of visual deficits in early childhood of USH patients (Stingl et\u00a0al, 2019). Interestingly, the changes in subcellular morphology, the reduction in electrophysiological PRC function and the observed changes in visually guided behavior (Fig\u20092) come along with only very mild effects on overall retinal morphology (Fig\u20093E and Appendix\u00a0Fig S9). It needs to be considered, however, that the retinal phenotype in USH1 patients varies widely, ranging from intact central retinal architecture and excellent visual acuity at 45\u2009years to advanced central retinal damage and legal blindness by their early 30s (Lenassi et\u00a0al, 2014). Such a phenotypic heterogeneity is observed in most if not all forms of inherited retinal diseases and is thought to arise from genetic or environmental confounding factors or a combination thereof (Veleri et\u00a0al, 2015). The possibility to examine the USH1C pig model under standardized conditions will help to discern the effect of the mutation from other influencing factors.",
                "In our work, we give also first indications for a potentially impaired hearing ability in heterozygous USH1C carriers (Figs\u20093A and EV2E and F). As the results were consistent at distinct ages, in different groups of animals and across the examined frequencies, we interpret this as a slight but significant biological effect. It must be considered that we are not aware of reports on impaired hearing in human USH1C carriers and so we cannot seriously estimate if these findings are of clinical relevance for human USH1C carriers. Taking into account the very low numbers of patients carrying distinct USH1C mutations, however, we would definitely exclude an evolutionary benefit of heterozygous USH1C defects, as it has been reasoned for the spreading of genes such as HBB (Piel et\u00a0al, 2010) or CFTR (Gabriel et\u00a0al, 1994; Pier et\u00a0al, 1998) in the human population.",
                "For the different aging processes in pig and human, a direct correlation of ages between the species is misleading. Instead, we propose to correlate the manifestation of fertility at 5\u20138\u2009months in pigs, compared to 12\u201315\u2009years in human beings, suggesting that a 12\u2010month\u2010old pig may fairly correspond to a biological age of 15\u201325\u2009years in humans (http://www.age\u2010converter.com/, https://unleashpetphotography.com/animal\u2010age\u2010calculator). Accordingly, the phenotype in USH1C pigs appears to reflect patients well within the published spectrum of disease severity and progression. As a consequence, we would also suppose that translating clinically established endpoints (as measured e.g., by ERG or OCT) from human to pig will support the assessment of future pre\u2010clinical studies in our model. Vice versa, the multi\u2010disciplinary examination of the model described here defined novel disease hallmarks, which may give rise to alternative endpoints for future clinical trials. The value of additional read\u2010out parameters such as motion analysis (Fig\u20092) is corroborated by a pivotal study documenting the success of the voretigene neparvovec AAV\u2010based drug in the multi luminance mobility test (MLMT) as primary endpoint (Russell et\u00a0al, 2017).",
                "The specific wavelength sensitivity of cones (Kostic & Arsenijevic, 2016) and the complex interaction of vision with other sensory organs required substantial effort in the investigation of visually guided behavior. Parcour tests were conducted under distinct light conditions, but calculated luminance levels in the pig eye suggested that the experiments took place at the lower and upper limit of mesopic sensing (Zele & Cao, 2014). Albeit this prevents a clear discrimination of rod\u2010 and cone\u2010based vision in the motion analysis, essential conclusions can be drawn. First, the similarity of core parameters such as duration and snout contacts in the hurdle parcour between USH1C animals and WT controls in the dark confirms that pigs substantially rely on non\u2010vision sensing and denies an exclusive or dominant effect of vestibular dysfunction on movement. Second, the clear differences in illuminated environment and the characteristic difficulties that USH1C pigs have in the recognition of defined objects (Fig\u20092A\u2013C) document their substantial problems in orienting within a structured 3D space. Although an influence of the bilateral vestibular dysfunction on orientation cannot be excluded (Kremmyda et\u00a0al, 2016), the faster and smoother locomotion (Fig\u20092D) of WT control pigs, specifically under light conditions, demonstrates how a normal visual function promotes effective clearance of obstacles and \u201celegant\u201d motion.",
                "Taken together, the generation of an USH1C pig model has substantially improved our molecular understanding of the disease. We now have several lines of evidence how harmonin supports PRC function and the particular integrity of the OS. The early onset of basic defects in the retina and the impairment during the first year provides an ideal foundation for following the natural history of USH1C. Combining quantitative motion analysis with clinical examination tools will promote the definition of read\u2010out parameters in pre\u2010clinical studies and in clinical trials for treating the Usher syndrome, but also in trials involving patients with other progressive blinding or audiovestibular diseases. The long\u2010term maintenance of retinal structures and, moreover, the success of exploratory gene therapy approaches in older animals is highly relevant as it indicates a large window of therapeutic opportunity for USH1 patients."

Distinct porcine primary cell lines (Richter et\u00a0al, 2012) were examined for SNPs in the target region and 3 distinct gRNAs, rk1, rk3, and rk4 that were not affected by cell line\u2010specific SNPs were examined for their power to introduce NHEJ\u2010based mutations in pig primary cells lines; for this, cells were nucleofected and after 48\u2009h the target locus was amplified with the primers ushwt1f and ushwt1r, cloned into plasmids and sequenced.

BACs CH242\u2010515C3 and CH242\u2010199J14, were identified to completely carry the porcine USH1C locus via the Sscrofa 10.2 reference genome and the PigPre BAC map (www.ensemlb.org) and purchased from CHORI BACPAC Resources Center (BACPAC Genomics, Emeryville, CA, USA).

If there was no recordable ABR at 100\u2009dBSPL in USH1C\u2010null animals, ABR was also conducted at 120\u2009dBSPL (twice for each ear). Additional testing comprised ABR at decreasing steps of 10\u2009dB in WT piglets. Hearing threshold was determined as the minimal click intensity that still evoked a noticeable potential negative peak after peak V.

                                "Full\u2010field ERG was recorded with a corneal Kooijman electrode (Roland Consult, Brandenburg an der Havel, Germany). Platinum needles were placed subcutaneously at the temple and top of the head between the ears as reference and ground electrodes respectively. Stimuli were brief white flashes (4\u2009ms) delivered from a light source within the Kooijman electrode (Kooijman & Damhof, 1986). The RETImap system (Roland Consult) was used for stimulus generation and data acquisition. The recording protocol used was based on, and extended from, the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standard for human clinical full\u2010field ERG. A band\u2010pass filter was used to remove frequencies outside 1\u2013300\u2009Hz. An interstimulus interval (ISI) of 1\u2009s was used with 20 responses recorded and averaged for each single flash protocol. For scotopic ERG, the protocol consisted of 30\u2009min dark\u2010adaptation, followed by recording of a dark\u2010adapted single flash series with increasing luminance from \u22123.0 log cd*s*m\u22122 to 2.0 log cd*s*m\u22122. After completion of the dark\u2010adapted intensity series, animals were light adapted for 10\u2009min to a steady white background of 30\u2009cd*s*m\u22122 with the same light source. Light\u2010adapted standard flash was recorded by using white flash stimuli at 0 log cd*s*m\u22122. The same luminance was used to record a 28\u2009Hz flicker response for 300\u2009ms. For multifocal ERG, the mfERG was recorded using the same RETImap system (Roland Consult) using a 61\u2010hexagon stimulus and according to the standard of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (Hood et\u00a0al, 2012). A 61\u2010hexagon stimulus was presented on a 51\u2010cm cathode ray tube monitor with a frame frequency of 60\u2009Hz. It encompassed the central visual field of 44\u00b0 horizontally and vertically. The scaled\u2010size hexagons (distortion factor 4) were light\u2010modulated according to a binary pseudorandom m\u2010sequence. The light state had a luminance of 120\u2009cd/m\u22122 and the dark state of 1\u2009cd/m\u22122. Refractive errors were not corrected. Pupil dilation was achieved with one drop of tropicamide\u2013phenylephrine mixture into the conjunctival sac of each eye about 15\u2009min before the exam. Contact lens electrodes (ERG\u2010jet\u00ae, CareFusion, San Diego, USA) were applied. Amplifier gain was set to 50,000 and the band\u2010pass from 5 to 100\u2009Hz. There were eight recording cycles of 47\u2009s each. The 61 traces are displayed separately in a false\u2010color\u2010coded amplitude map identifying P1 amplitude (measured from the N1 trough to the following maximum positive peak; N1 amplitude was measured from the electroneutral starting point to the first negative deflection). All traces were also grouped into one response value and the averaged first\u2010order kernel function displayed as single trace. Luminance levels in the pig eye were calculated from the light intensity measured at the floor. Given the complex physical correlation between light source, reflection, and sensing in an indoor 3D space, it is challenging to determine corresponding luminance levels in the pig eye, but considering the general reflexion parameter \u03c1 as 0.2 seems a fair approximation."

                                "The design was adapted from a previous publication (Barone et\u00a0al, 2018). Ten barriers (boards of 94\u2009\u00d7\u200976\u2009cm) were placed in a distance of one meter in a straight aisle (12\u2009\u00d7\u20092.2\u2009m) alternating in the middle, the left or right positions. There were four different arrangements of barriers, which were used alternatingly (Appendix\u00a0Fig S4). Pigs were trained in the course until they walked straight through the course without pausing or hesitating for at least two times in a row. After a training period of four weeks, the animals were tested in the course weekly. The pigs entered the course individually in random order, they had to pass the barriers, and at the end, they were rewarded with fruit juice in a food bowl. The test was performed before feeding to ensure a higher motivation in the pigs. After some runs in the light, the test was conducted alternately in the light (average of 135 lux) and in the dark (average of 2.9 lux). Illumination level was measured at three different sites in the course (start, middle and end) in animals\u2019 head height. Each run was documented by video. The pigs were marked with numbers on their backs to facilitate recognition. The times pigs took for passing the course, from snout crossing the start line until the pig was touching the food bowl, were measured. All barrier contacts by the pigs were counted. Contacts were divided into two subgroups. Frontal contacts mean the pig was touching the barrier with its snout or head, while contacts were called lateral when the pig was touching the obstacle barrier with its shoulders or hips. Each turning around or walking back before reaching the end was counted. It was distinguished between turns in front of the course and turns within the course. Such runs were excluded. After turning around, animals were sent back to the course, and the new run was documented with time and contacts when they reached the end. Walking in circles was counted as a separate event as well. As long as they were just circling and not walking back, the run was not excluded, time measurement was continuing. When the pig was circling in front of the start line, those circles were also counted, but time measurement only started when the animal was crossing the start line. Pigs were excluded from parcour testing when they were lame or when they had already been outside of their pen on the experiment day for another reason. When a pig was turning around or circling so often that it needed longer than two minutes to walk to the endpoint, the run was also excluded. The numbers of turns/circles within those two minutes were nonetheless counted. Pigs were not included in the study when motivation was lacking, for example, in the case a pig did not head to the endpoint reliably after six weeks of training or when it seemed more interested in playing with the barriers than walking straight to the food bowl."

The course was 6.15\u2009m long, the width was 1.58\u2009m in the beginning and 2.48\u2009m in the end. Most obstacles were built from obstacles used for equestrian sport, other obstacles were a stepboard and barrels. Obstacles were rearranged for almost each test day (Appendix\u00a0Fig S5).",
                                "Pigs were trained until they walked straight through the obstacle course to the food trough without stopping or hesitating. After a training period of three weeks, the pigs were performing the course once a week. The pigs entered the course individually in random order, they had to pass the obstacles and at the end they were rewarded with a cookie in a food trough. The test was conducted under light and dim conditions. Each run was documented by video. The pigs were marked with numbers to facilitate recognition. The times the pigs needed to pass the course were measured. All contacts with the obstacles or the wall were counted. When a pig nudged one obstacle more than once in a playful way in the same area, this was counted as one touch. When a pig touched one obstacle at different sites, each contact was counted separately. When a pig swept along an obstacle with its snout, this was counted as two touches. When a pig turned around before reaching the end or when a pig was lame, the pig was excluded for the test day. For analyzing the trajectory, the dimensions of the course and the gaps of the slatted floor were measured and scaled at 1:100 (Macromedia FreeHand MX, STUDIOMX 2004). Using the slatted floor as a ruler, each footstep of each animal in each qualified run were plotted in the map. X and Y coordinates of footsteps as well as the corresponding times when the foot touched the ground were transferred to an excel file. Trajectories were analyzed from these data sets with the R package trajr. Briefly, we first imported and smoothed all trajectories to avoid any source of noise by applying a Savitzky\u2010Golay smoothing filter (Savitzky & Golay, 1964; Luo et\u00a0al, 2005). Then, we called all the functions of the trajr packages (McLean & Skowron Volponi, 2018) to characterize the trajectories into measures of speed, length, distance, duration and measures of straightness or tortuosity. The trajectory significance was tested using Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. For statistical evaluation, data were checked for consistency and normality. Fisher\u2019s exact test or Pearson\u2019s test were used to analyze cross tabulations. Generalized linear models with Poisson distribution, Median tests, bootstrap\u2010t tests based on 5000 Monte Carlo simulations, t\u2010tests with and without the assumption of homogeneity, Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010tests were used to test continuously distributed variables. All reported tests were two\u2010sided, and P\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed by use of NCSS_10 (NCSS LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA), STATISTICA_13 (Statsoft, Tulsa, OK, USA), MATHEMATICA_12 (Wolfram Research, Hanborough, UK), Champaign, IL (2018) and PASW 24 (SPSS by IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA), and Prism_5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA, USA)."

After 5\u2009weeks injection sites were evaluated by OCT (see above) and funduscopy, confirming the concise injection sites. Following enucleation, the eyecup was dissected and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Flattened whole mount preparations of the eyecup were analyzed by epifluorescence using a handhold device (Bluestar Flashlight, Nightsea, Lexington, MA, USA).
