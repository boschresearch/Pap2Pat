                        "The human genome produces many thousands of lncRNAs [1-3]\u2014transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode for proteins\u2014and certain lncRNAs play key roles in the pathogenesis of cancer [4-7]. LncRNAs exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function [1,8], making this class of transcripts attractive for targeted cancer therapy. However, it is currently not possible to predict which of these non-coding transcripts would be effective therapeutic targets, let alone those that could sensitize cancer cells to radiation. To rapidly develop lncRNAs as a class of targets for cancer therapy, systematic functional screens are necessary.",
                        "CRISPR-based technologies have enabled genome-scale screens of gene function in mammalian cells [8-16]. These screening methods have been valuable to the identification of genes\u2014non-coding in addition to coding\u2014that are essential for various cellular phenotypes. However, whether such screen-identified hits can increase the efficacy of ionizing radiation\u2014a critical adjunctive cancer therapy for many malignancies\u2014has not been systematically studied at large scale.",
                        "Malignant glioma\u2014a primary cancer of the central nervous system (CNS)\u2014is a fatal diagnosis for most patients [17]. Despite surgery and adjuvant therapy such as fractionated radiation, adults with glioblastoma (GBM) have a median survival of only 14 months [18,19]. In children, the most common malignant glioma is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). DIPG is primarily treated with radiotherapy, but median survival is only 9-10 months, and few patients survive more than two years after diagnosis [20-22]. While radiation is a critical component of the treatment of both adult and pediatric malignant gliomas by reducing tumor growth [19,23,24], the toxicity of radiation to normal brain cells limits the total dose that can be delivered, and glioma cells that survive radiation lead to tumor recurrence. Thus, therapeutics that increase the efficacy of radiation without reducing the viability of normal brain cells would be of critical clinical benefit, complementing the current standard-of-care for nearly all patients with malignant gliomas.",
                        "Organoids are miniature three dimensional (3D) representations of their in vivo counterpart organs, and organoid-based models of cancer are emerging as a useful platform for the evaluation of therapeutics [25]. Human brain organoids have been generated from pluripotent stem cell (PSC) populations, mimicking early stages of fetal brain development [26-28]. Such embryonic brain organoids have been useful to study the genetic mutations that cause GBM [29] and can also serve as a 3D tissue substrate for the growth of glial tumors [30]. However, embryonic brain organoids do not closely represent the mature brain tissue of glioma patients, limiting their utility for assessing potential drug toxicity to normal adult brain cells."

                        "A radiation modifier screen using CRISPRi was developed to identify specific lncRNAs that sensitize glioma cells to radiotherapy. In this screen of 5689 lncRNA loci, 467 hits were found to modify cell growth in the presence of radiation. 33 of these hits sensitized cells to clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric glioma, nine of these hits were prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS). Knockdown of lncGRS-1 (CTC-338M12.4 located on chromosome 5 q35.3) inhibited the growth of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but the viability of normal brain cells was not harmed. While lncGRS-1 is primate-conserved, this lncRNA does not exist in rodents, making traditional in vivo mouse models of glioma suboptimal for assessing potential toxicity of lncGRS-1 knockdown in normal brain tissue. A novel human brain organoid model of malignant glioma was therefore developed. To mimic the brains of patients, \u201cmature\u201d human brain organoids (MBOs) were assembled from mature neural cells types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and human glioma cells grew invasively within these 3D tissues. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting lncGRS-1 selectively decreased tumor growth and sensitized glioma cells to radiation therapy. These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the vast non-coding genome.",

(2013) Cell. 152 (5): 1173-1183, incorporated by reference herein), makes genome-scale CRISPRi screening of lncRNA gene function possible. See Liu et al. (2017) Science. 355:eaah7111 (incorporated by reference herein) and US 2017/0204407 (incorporated by reference herein).

Each test cell comprises a small guide RNA (sgRNA) that targets a locus encoding a lncRNA and a nuclease-deficient sgRNA-mediated nuclease (dCas9) and thus, the locus targeted by the sgRNA comprised in the test cell selected can be then identified as a radiotherapy sensitizer. The plurality of test cells for such a screening may be obtained by using a CRISPRi library targeting lncRNA loci, or CRiNCL, as described in, for example, Liu et al. (2017, Science. 355:eaah7111; incorporated by reference in its entirty herein), and the cells may be engineered to stably express the dCas9.

Organoids are miniature three dimensional (3D) representations of their in vivo counterpart organs, and organoid-based models of cancer are emerging as a useful platform for the evaluation of therapeutics [25]. Different organoid platforms have their own important utility in different pre-clinical research uses.",

Such embryonic brain organoids have been useful to study the genetic mutations that cause GBM [29] and can also serve as a 3D tissue substrate for the growth of glial tumors [30]. However, embryonic brain organoids do not closely represent the mature brain tissue of glioma patients, limiting their utility for assessing potential drug toxicity to normal adult brain cells.",

In contrast to embryonic brain organoids that mimic early stages of fetal brain development, MBOs are assembled from cell populations that are more mature and postmitotic [54,55]. Because embryonic brain organoids contain a large proportion of proliferative precursor cells, radiation treatment and/or other traditional chemotherapies may not be well-tolerated by such normal but immature cells. A systematic three-dimensional coculture containing pre-differentiated human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived astrocytes (hAstros) combined with neurons generated from hPSC-derived neural stem cells (hNeurons) or directly induced via Neurogenin 2 overexpression (iNeurons) has been previously described.

                                "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function, making this class of transcript attractive for targeted cancer therapy. However, the vast majority of lncRNAs have not been tested as potential therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of currently used cancer treatments. Malignant glioma is rapidly fatal, and ionizing radiation is part of the current standard-of-care used to slow tumor growth in both adult and pediatric patients.",
                                "We use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to screen 5689 lncRNA loci in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, identifying 467 hits that modify cell growth in the presence of clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation. 33 of these lncRNA hits sensitize cells to radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric glioma, nine of these hits are prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS). Knockdown of lncGRS-1, a primate-conserved, nuclear-enriched lncRNA, inhibits the growth and proliferation of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but not the viability of normal brain cells. Using human brain organoids comprised of mature neural cell types as a 3-dimensional tissue substrate to model the invasive growth of glioma, we find that antisense oligonucleotides targeting lncGRS-1 selectively decrease tumor growth and sensitize glioma cells to radiation therapy.",
                                "These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the vast non-coding genome to enhance radiation therapy.",

                                "i. Cell Culture and Radiation Treatment",
                                "U87, HeLa, NHA and HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics/antimycotics. DIPG SF8628, GBM SF10360 and GBM 43 were cultured in N5 (Neurobasal-A (1\u00d7), N2 (1\u00d7), B27 supplement without vitamin A (1\u00d7), L-glutamine (1\u00d7)), 5% FBS, FGF and EGF (20 ng/mL each). SU-DIPG 24 and SU-DIPG 25 were cultured in TSM (Neurobasal-A (1\u00d7), DMEM/F12 (1\u00d7), HEPES (10 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), MEM non-essential amino acids solution (0.1 mM), GlutaMax supplement (1\u00d7), antibiotic-antimycotic (1\u00d7)) with EGF (20 ng/mL), FGF-basic-154 (20 ng/mL), PDGF-AA (10 ng/mL), PDGF-BB (10 ng/mL) and Heparin (2 ug/mL). Proliferation was measured using a manual hemocytometer. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.), and apoptosis was measured using the Apo-ONE Homogenous Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Radiation was delivered using a Cesium-137 irradiator with rotating platform, with cells treated while in suspension for the CRISPRi screen and after achieving adherence on plates for validation assays.",
                                "Determination of radiation synergy was calculated as follows. The null model of additive effects was determined by multiplying the mean decrease in cell proliferation caused by radiation treatment alone by the decrease in cell proliferation following gene knockdown. Synergistic effects were identified if the observed absolute decrease in cell proliferation following combination of lncRNA knockdown and radiation was significantly greater than the predicted decrease in cell proliferation based on the additive model (two tailed Student's t test).",
                                "ii. CRISPRi Screens",
                                "sgRNA library was derived from the CRISPRi Non-Coding Library (CRiNCL) [8], selecting sub-libraries that targeted all expressed lncRNAs in U87: Common+Cancer common+(U87, HEK293T)+U87 unique. sgRNAs were cloned into the library expression vector pCRISPRia-v2 [11,68] and lentivirus pools were generated as previously described [8]. U87-dCas9-KRAB cells were generated previously in [69]. Lentivirus libraries were infected in duplicate cultures, cultured for 2 days following infection, puromycin (1 mg/mL) selected for two days, and recovered for one day without puromycin. Cells were then cultured for 12 days at a minimum coverage of 1000\u00d7, starting at this \u201cT0.\u201d For the radiation modifier screen, doses of 2 Gy radiation were given at the following days: T0, T2, T4, T6, for a total of 8 Gy fractionated ionizing radiation. Genomic DNA was harvested from aliquots of \u02dc60M cells each from T0 and T12 and processed for sequencing as previously described [11,68]. Data processing and hit analysis was performed as described in [8], with the exception that neighbor hits were considered to be hits whose TSS's were within 1 kb of any protein coding gene TSS expressed in U87. Growth-only screen data for U87 was obtained from [8] and compared to the radiation screen data obtained in this study. For the identification of radiation sensitizers, the screen scores (defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs against a given gene multiplied by the negative log10(Mann-Whitney-U p value) for that gene) for the radiation screen was compared to those of the growth screen for all genes targeted in both screens. Phenotype in these CRISPRi screens refer to the relative log 2 enrichment of barcodes in the final timepoint divided by the enrichment of barcodes at the initial timepoint, as has been previously described [8,11]. A screen score threshold of 5, which corresponded to an empirical false discovery rate of 0.25%, was applied to both screens, and hits with radiation scores greater than growth scores were retained. LncRNAs with evidence of expression in primary glioma cells were then identified as lncGRS's. Z standardized growth and radiation phenotypes were calculated as log 2 enrichment normalized by the standard deviation of negative control genes' phenotypes. Sensitizer score was defined as the ratio of the radiation modifier screen score in irradiated cells to the growth screen score in non-irradiated cells.",
                                "sgRNA validation and internally controlled growth assays was performed as described in [8], with the addition of 4 fractions of 2 Gy radiation starting two days following sgRNA infection, delivered every other day. Purified populations of sgRNA expressing cells were selected in 1 mg/mL puromycin for 3 days before assay. Internally controlled CRISPRi growth assays were performed as previously described, briefly, by partially infecting a population of cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB with a fluorescently labeled sgRNA expression vector and tracking the sgRNA-infected population over time using flow cytometry relative to the non-infected population [8]. sgRNA protospacer sequences for individual knockdowns are listed in Table 2.",

RNA was purified using the Direct-zol MiniPrep or MicroPrep RNA purification kits (Zymo Research, Irvine, Calif.) with the on-column DNAse digestion step. cDNA was generated using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) and diluted 1:5 fold before proceeding to qPCR. qPCR was performed using the SYBR Green I Master Mix (Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland). qPCR primers are listed in Table 2.",

                                "To systematically identify lncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets that sensitize malignant glioma to radiotherapy, we developed a radiation modifier screen using CRISPRi for gene knockdown. CRISPRi represses transcription via the recruitment of catalytically \u201cdead\u201d Cas9 protein fused to the KRAB repressor (dCas9-KRAB), which is targeted to transcriptional start sites (TSS) by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) [11,31,32]. For the screen, we used a workhorse GBM cell line (U87) engineered to stably express dCas9-KRAB (U87-dCas9-KRAB) to identify hits for subsequent study in patient-derived cultures of pediatric and adult forms of malignant glioma.",
                                "First, a radiation dose and delivery schedule in U87-dCas9-KRAB cells that enables the discovery of radiation-effect modifiers was determined. For the treatment of human GBM patients, the total radiation dose is typically delivered in \u02dc2 Gy daily fractions [18,19]. When 2 Gy was delivered to U87-dCas9-KRAB cells as a single dose, cell proliferation transiently decreased but returned to normal after 8-10 days (FIG. 1A). A single dose of 4 or 8 Gy had correspondingly stronger and more prolonged inhibitory effects upon cell proliferation (FIG. 1A), and RNA-seq analysis revealed dose dependent gene expression changes including induction of the p53 pathway and repression of DNA replication (FIG. 2A). However, these higher single doses exceed those typically used for patients with malignant glioma. Thus, a total radiation dose of 8 Gy delivered in 2 Gy fractions given every other day (8 Gy in 4 fractions) was also tested. This 8 Gy fractionated dose increased the cell doubling time by approximately 2-fold, which is an effect size approximating LD50 (FIG. 1A), which allows optimal discovery of both synergistic and buffering screen hits [33], while still utilizing a clinically relevant fractional dose of 2 Gy.",
                                "Whether U87-dCas9-KRAB cells treated with 8 Gy fractionated radiation can reveal radiation sensitization effects with CRISPRi gene targeting was next tested. The inhibition of DNA repair pathways is known to potentiate the therapeutic effects of radiation in cancer cells [34,35]. In internally controlled growth assays [8,11], two distinct CRISPRi sgRNAs targeting the DNA damage repair gene ERCC6L2 [36,37] reduced cell growth in U87 cells treated with 8 Gy fractionated radiation (FIG. 1B). Without radiation treatment, CRISPRi targeting of ERCC6L2 did not reduce cell growth (FIG. 1C). Thus, CRISPRi targeting of the DNA repair gene ERCC6L2 produces a strong radiation sensitization effect in this in vitro model of fractionated radiotherapy.",

                                "Although disruption of known DNA repair pathways is an intriguing avenue for novel therapeutics, accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage may paradoxically increase cancer risk [38,39]. The human genome produces thousands of lncRNAs that represent a large set of novel potential therapeutic targets. The function of 5689 lncRNAs expressed in human glioma were screened by leveraging a CRISPRi Non-Coding Library [8], selecting 10 sgRNAs for each lncRNA TSS and cloning this pool of 56,890 sgRNAs into lentiviral vectors along with 1202 non-targeting control sgRNAs (FIG. 3A). This lentiviral sgRNA library was used to infect two replicates of U87-dCas9-KRAB cultures, selected for infected cells with puromycin, treated cultures with 8 Gy fractionated radiation, then continued cell propagation for a total of 12 days. The proportion of sgRNA positive cells remained stable throughout the screen, indicating that CRISPRi targeting does not exhibit non-specific toxicity even after radiation treatment (FIG. 4A).",
                                "Targeted next generation sequencing of sgRNA barcodes performed at the beginning and end of the screen (\u02dc7.1 cell doublings) identified 652 loci that modified cell growth and proliferation in the presence of radiation as compared to the effect of radiation alone (FDR=0.25%). 185 of these lncRNA TSS hits were within 1 kb of an expressed protein-coding gene and therefore conservatively labeled as \u201cneighbor hits,\u201d with the 1 kb window around the TSS being based on analyses of CRISPRi mechanism and maximum effective distance for knockdown [8,11]. These neighbor hits were removed from further analysis, leaving 467 \u201clncRNA hits\u201d that modified the propagation of radiation-treated U87 cells (FIG. 3B). Interestingly, CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of the lncRNA PVT1 protected cells against the effect of radiation (FIG. 4B), consistent with PVT1 acting as a negative regulator of MYC [40]. The other 466 lncRNA hits negatively affected cell culture growth when combined with radiation.",
                                "To identify lncRNA hits that sensitized cells to the effect of radiation, the screen scores (defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs against a given gene multiplied by the negative log10(Mann-Whitney-U p value) for that gene) for the radiation modifier screen were compared with the growth screen scores from U87 cells that were not irradiated [8,11]. 33 hits identified in both screens had screen scores that were greater in the radiation modifier screen (FIG. 3C). Interestingly, the expression of these 33 sensitizer lncRNA hits tended to be downregulated following exposure to 8 Gy of radiation (Pearson R=0.36), which was not observed for the larger set of 467 hits (Pearson R=0.079) (FIG. 4C), suggesting that transcriptional repression following radiation may be a common feature of lncRNA radiosensitizers. Nine of these 33 sensitizer hits were expressed in a panel of various malignant glioma cells including both adult GBM (U87, SF10360, SF10281) and pediatric DIPG (SF8628, SF10218). These nine hits were ranked by a \u201csensitizer score,\u201d which is defined as the ratio of the radiation modifier screen score in irradiated cells to the growth screen score in non-irradiated cells, and denoted these genes as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS) 1 to 9 (FIG. 3D). To more accurately survey the transcript structure(s) of these hits, long-read single molecule native RNA sequencing was performed using the Oxford Nanopore PromethION and defined transcript variants and splice boundaries of lncGRS-1 through 9 (FIG. 5A and FIG. 6).",

Although previously annotated (CTC-338M12.4) [41], this lncRNA's biological function was not known. Cell fractionation analysis (FIG. 5B) and in situ hybridization studies (FIG. 5C and FIG. 8A) revealed lncGRS-1 to be a nuclear-enriched transcript in glioma cells, including those of patient-derived, primary glioma cultures. Furthermore, lncGRS-1 transcription is downregulated following radiation (FIG. 2B).",
                                "In internally controlled growth assays of U87 cell growth, CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 with two different, individual sgRNAs (FIG. 5D) reduced cell proliferation by \u02dc48% in the absence of radiation (FIG. 5E). Treatment of cells with 8 Gy fractionated radiation alone decreased cell proliferation (FIG. 1A), and lncGRS-1 knockdown further reduced cell proliferation by \u02dc37% relative to radiation alone (FIG. 5F). U87-dCas9-KRAB cells that express sgRNA against lncGRS-1 or non-targeting control sgRNAs were purified and the growth of these cultures with and without 8 Gy fractionated radiation was studied. Without radiation, sgRNAs against lncGRS-1 reduced cell proliferation by 42% (FIG. 5G), and radiation alone reduced the proliferation of cells expressing control sgRNAs by 71% (FIG. 5G and FIG. 5H). When combined, lncGRS-1 knockdown and radiation treatment resulted in a pronounced 95% decrease in proliferation (FIG. 5H), indicating synergy of the two treatments, as the predicted decrease in cell proliferation from an additive effect model is only 83% (p=0.0052). Interestingly, while radiation decreased proliferation of HeLa cervical cancer cells by 74%, consistent with known radiosensitivity of cervical cancer [42], the combination of CRISPRi-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown with radiation was indistinguishable from radiation alone (FIG. 5I and FIG. 5J), suggesting that lncGRS-1 is a cell type-specific radiation sensitizer target.",

Human adult GBM (SF10360) and pediatric DIPG (SF8628) cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were generated and the effect of CRISPRi-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown was studied in internally controlled growth assays. In both GBM SF10360 and DIPG SF8628 cells, lncGRS-1 knockdown produced growth inhibition (FIG. 7A and FIG. 7B) similar to that observed in U87 cultures.

To confirm the ability of ASOs to efficiently deplete gene expression, we used ASOs to knockdown TP53 (p53) in U87 cells and observed \u02dc99% knockdown efficiency (FIG. 8B). Locked nucleic acid ASOs against lncGRS-1 were then designed (FIG. 8C; Table 2) and tested for efficacy in patient-derived glioma cell cultures. Two different ASOs against lncGRS-1 produced a mean knockdown of 89% in patient-derived GBM SF10360 cells and 93% in patient-derived DIPG SF8628 cells (FIG. 7C). Cell proliferation was decreased by an average of 80% across both ASOs in both SF10360 and SF8628 by 11 days post transfection (FIG. 7D). ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 also decreased the proliferation of patient-derived DIPG cultures SU-DIPG 24, SU-DIPG 25 (FIG. 8D and FIG. 8E), and GBM 43 (FIG. 8F). Thus, ASOs targeting lncGRS-1 inhibit the growth of multiple human patient-derived cultures of malignant glioma.",

                                "Current standard-of-care treatments for glioma are limited by toxicity to normal tissues [23]. Consistent with lncRNAs having exquisitely cell type-specific essential function [8], ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 did not affect the proliferation of the kidney derived HEK293T cell line (FIG. 8G). Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type of the human brain [46] and are phenotypically related to subpopulations of malignant glioma [47,48]. Thus, the effect of lncGRS-1 knockdown in cultures of normal human astrocytes (NHA) [49] was next investigated. Knockdown of essential gene POLA1 (DNA polymerase alpha 1) resulted in decreased proliferation of NHA cells, in addition to U87 GBM cells (FIG. 8H-8i). While ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown was robustly achieved in NHA (FIG. 9A), cell proliferation was not reduced (FIG. 9B). Moreover, in NHA, measures of cell viability and apoptosis were not changed by lncGRS-1 knockdown, whereas in patient-derived glioma cells, viability was decreased and apoptosis was increased (FIG. 9C). Finally, CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 with the same two sgRNAs used for knockdown in U87 cells did not result in decreased proliferation in HeLa cervical cancer cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (FIG. 10A), despite these cells expressing lncGRS-1 at a robust level (TPM=4.38) amongst the CCLE compendium of cancer cell lines (FIG. 10B) [42].",
                                "To investigate the glioma-specific phenotype of lncGRS-1, RNA-seq analysis following ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown was performed. In GBM (U87), DIPG (SF8628), and NHA cells, lncGRS-1 expression was decreased by 80-88% 24 hours after ASO treatment (FIG. 9E). Consistent with the changes in viability and apoptosis observed with lncGRS-1 knockdown, both GBM and DIPG cells exhibited transcriptome-wide differential gene expression (984 and 3600 genes adj. p<0.05, respectively; FIG. 9E). Upregulated genes in U87 and SF8628 were enriched for p53 signaling and apoptosis, while downregulated genes were enriched for cell cycle and DNA damage response (FIG. 10C). Despite different gene ontology terms, differentially expressed genes between U87 and SF8628 cells were positively correlated following knockdown of lncGRS-1 (Pearson R=0.667; FIG. 10D). Consistent with these genome-wide changes, levels of CDKN1A (p21) increased at the level of both mRNA and protein following lncGRS-1 knockdown in U87 cells (FIG. 10E-10F, FIG. 13). These cells also exhibited decreased proportions of G2/M phase in population level flow cytometry (FIG. 9D). Interestingly, while lncGRS-1 knockdown resulted in increased p53BP1 foci in U87 cells in the absence of radiation, \u03b3H2AX foci induced by radiation were potentiated by knockdown of lncGRS-1, yet lncGRS-1 knockdown in the absence of radiation did not generate additional \u03b3H2AX foci (FIG. 10G-10H). Remarkably, while ASOs were effective for lncGRS-1 knockdown in NHA, such genome-wide changes to the transcriptome were not observed in these non-tumorigenic cells (FIG. 9E).",

                                "While the genomic sequences of lncGRS-1 are conserved across primates, orthologs of this lncRNA do not exist in lower vertebrates such as mice, chicken, and zebrafish (FIG. 5A and FIG. 6). Therefore, evaluating the potential toxicity of lncGRS-1 knockdown in normal postnatal brain necessitates an alternative to xenograft mouse models. Recent studies have shown that embryonic cerebral organoids can serve as 3D tissue \u201chosts\u201d for the growth of human glioma cells [30]. However, such embryonic brain organoids are comprised mostly of immature, proliferative neural progenitors and contain very few astrocytes [50-52], which are a type of glia essential to neuronal viability and function [53]. Thus, \u201cmature\u201d human brain organoids (MBOs) that more closely reflect the differentiated cellular state of the postnatal human brain (FIG. 11A) were generated.",
                                "Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type of the adult human brain [53]. Pure populations of mature human astrocytes from human iPSCs (iAstrocytes) were generated using a protocol that allows maturation for at least six months [54,55]. Using an isogenic iPSC (WTC11) clone that carries an inducible Neurogenin2 (NGN2) transgene, we also generated homogenous cultures of mature cortical neurons (iNeurons) with NGN2 induction [54,56]. MBOs can be formed from iAstrocytes and iNeurons by mixing and co-culture of these cell types in defined numbers and ratios (from a 1:1 ratio to solely iAstrocytes or iNeurons) (FIG. 11A) [55].",
                                "To build upon the studies of NHAs in 2D culture, MBOs assembled from iAstrocytes (A-MBOS) were first studied. Unlike astrocytes in 2D culture, iAstrocytes in MBOs become highly ramified and develop complex structures similar to those observed in human brain tissue [55]. Transfection of A-MBOs with ASOs against lncGRS-1 was effective for its knockdown as assessed by both in situ hybridization, demonstrating depletion of lncGRS-1 within nuclei (FIG. 11B), and RT-qPCR (FIG. 11C, FIG. 12A). Similar to our results from NHAs in 2D culture (FIG. 9A-9C), ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown in A-MBOs did not reduce organoid viability or increase apoptosis (FIG. 11D).",
                                "A-MBOs were next used as the \u201chost\u201d for human glioma tumor growth (FIG. 11E). After DIPG SF8628 cells labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) were seeded to the surface of these MBOs, RFP+ tumors grew progressively larger within the organoid tissue in an invasive manner, when individually monitored using serial microscopic imaging (FIG. 11F). For treatment of a human CNS disease, ASOs are administered weekly directly into the cerebrospinal space [57]. Mimicking this dosing schedule, ASOs were added into the organoid culture media every 7 days. In each organoid, the growth of RFP+ tumors was prospectively imaged (FIG. 11F and FIG. 11G), and tumor burden was estimated by quantification of the RFP signal. ASOs against lncGRS-1 reduced DIPG tumor growth as compared to non-targeting, negative control ASOs (FIG. 11H). Consistent with our results of organoid viability and apoptosis without infiltrated tumor cells (FIG. 11D), the overall size of the host brain organoid was not changed by lncGRS-1 knockdown (FIG. 11I).",
                                "The MBO-glioma model was further developed by using MBOs assembled from both iAstrocytes and i3Neurons (AN-MBOs) and also including radiation therapy. ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 did not affect the viability of AN-MBOs (FIG. 12B). Furthermore, treatment of AN-MBOs with clinically therapeutic levels of fractionated radiation (total dose up to 54 Gy), with or without lncGRS-1 knockdown, did not affect the overall size of organoids over a period of 3 weeks (FIG. 12C). Using this AN-MBO model of radiotherapy, whether lncGRS-1 knockdown sensitizes glioma cells to the therapeutic effects of radiation was investigated. RFP labeled U87 cells were seeded to the surface of individual AN-MBOs isolated across multiple wells of a 96-well dish, and tumors grew invasively (FIG. 12D) and progressively larger when treated with negative control ASOs and no radiation when tracked using serial microscopic imaging (FIG. 12E). As expected, radiation treatment alone (control ASOs with increasing doses of radiation) exhibited a trend of tumor inhibition (FIG. 11J). Notably, when radiation (18 Gy in 9 fractions, or 12 Gy in 6 fractions) was combined with ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown, the tumor burden was significantly lower than that observed with radiation alone (FIG. 11J and FIG. 12E). Thus, ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 sensitizes malignant glioma to the therapeutic effects of radiation in this 3D model of tumor growth.",
                                "3. Discussion",
                                "In this study, a CRISPRi-based pooled screening platform was developed to discover novel non-coding therapeutic targets in human malignant glioma that can enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. Given that CRISPRi is effective in a wide range of cancer cell types [8], this work presents a conceptual and experimental framework that can be used to rapidly interrogate new targets in multiple, clinically relevant treatment combinations (e.g., synthetic lethality with traditional chemotherapy and/or radiation, or with newer classes of targeted therapeutics). The prioritization of combinatorial therapeutic targets for preclinical development is increasingly needed, particularly for malignant glioma [58-60]. While the present study focused on lncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in glioma, the overall strategy described here could be easily adapted to screen other types of noncoding genomic elements as well as coding genes.",
                                "The interaction between radiation treatment and any particular biological target can be difficult to predict, especially when the mechanism of action of the target is not fully understood. In this study of lncRNAs, of the 467 screen hits that reduced the growth of irradiated GBM cells, only 33 hits behaved as sensitizers (having effect sizes greater with fractionated radiotherapy than without radiation). Interestingly, some lncRNA hits that reduced the growth of non-irradiated GBM cells appeared to ameliorate the effect of radiation (FIG. 3C). These results highlight the importance of unbiased functional genomics methods such as CRISPRi-based pooled screening, particularly when investigating new classes of potential therapeutic targets.",
                                "This systematic approach prioritized lncGRS-1 as a top radiation sensitizer for malignant glioma. Knockdown of lncGRS-1 with either CRISPRi or ASOs inhibited the growth of both adult and pediatric forms of malignant glioma, potentiating the therapeutic effects of clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiotherapy. Therefore, lncGRS-1 shares properties both of an essential gene that is required for normal growth and also a radiation sensitizer target.",
                                "However, despite being expressed in non-malignant brain cells, lncGRS-1 knockdown did not appear to adversely affect their viability or growth. Of particular note, ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 in NHA\u2014cells that proliferate as briskly as the patient-derived glioma cells\u2014did not impair the growth of this non-malignant glial cell type, nor did lncGRS-1 knockdown affect growth of the malignant but non-glioma cell line HeLa. While the transcriptomes of GBM and DIPG cells were broadly perturbed by lncGRS-1 knockdown, only 17 genes were differentially expressed (with lncGRS-1 being the most significant) in NHAs with the same ASO-mediated knockdown. The mechanism(s) underlying this glioma-specific function of lncGRS-1 remain to be discovered, but upon lncGRS-1 knockdown, we did observe activation of the p53 signaling pathway leading to upregulation of p53 effectors such as p21, correlating with a decrease in cell cycle progression. Our observations here build importantly on previous genome-scale studies that reveal essential lncRNAs as having exquisitely cell type-specific function [8,61,62]. Based on this emerging understanding of lncRNA biology, we speculate that lncRNAs as a class are enriched for targets that have important roles selectively in malignant cells.",
                                "Modeling human glioma in mice as transplanted xenografts is time-consuming and relatively expensive, particularly for early preclinical studies intended to screen new drugs for therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity [25]. Furthermore, certain human therapeutic targets do not exist in animal hosts\u2014as is the case for lncGRS-1\u2014decreasing the utility of animal models for assessing potential toxicity stemming from the ablation of such targets in normal tissue. Human organoids represent a medium-throughput platform for cancer studies [63], and the present studies demonstrate the utility of MBOs for simultaneously evaluating treatment efficacy and brain toxicity, including in the context of current radiotherapy treatment paradigms.",
                                "As a 3D tissue platform for the study of human glioma, MBOs offer certain characteristics that distinguish them from embryonic brain organoids and GBM-derived tumor organoids. In contrast to embryonic brain organoids that mimic early stages of fetal brain development, MBOs are assembled from cell populations that are more mature and postmitotic [54,55]. Because embryonic brain organoids contain a large proportion of proliferative precursor cells, radiation treatment and/or other traditional chemotherapies may not be well-tolerated by such normal but immature cells. GBM-derived tumor organoids are useful for the study of drug efficacy in 3D tissues, but because they are comprised of only tumor cells, toxicity to normal cells and therefore the therapeutic index [64] cannot be not assessed. Because of these differences, it is likely that each organoid platforms will have important utility in different pre-clinical research scenarios. As a bridge between in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical experiments intended to prioritize drug candidates and therapeutic targets, MBOs have shown utility in our study, identifying lncGRS-1 as a target for further preclinical development such as in vivo validation. One limitation of our MBO-glioma model is the absence of a complete tumor microenvironment, which includes microglia, stromal cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, among other cell types [65,66]. However, recent advances in tumor organoid derivation have demonstrated preservation of syngeneic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and stromal fibroblasts along with neoplastic cells using an air liquid interface [67]. Analogous strategies, in addition to the incorporation of vascular endothelial cells, may further augment the experimental utility of MBOs in future iterations.",
                                "4. Conclusion",
                                "There is an unmet need for cancer therapies that potentiate the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy while minimizing toxicity [59]. Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatment modalities for all cancers, and it is nearly always indicated for patients with malignant glioma [23]. The development of drug-radiotherapy combinations has generally been pursued with low-throughput, non-systematic approaches [60]. This genome scale CRISPRi-based radiation modifier screen of lncRNA loci in glioma demonstrates a strategy for revealing novel therapeutic targets in this vast, largely unexplored aspect of the noncoding genome. More broadly, it is anticipated that the coupling of large scale screening efforts with target validation in MBO models will serve as a useful framework for accelerating the development of new therapeutics (and combinations) through the preclinical research pipeline."
