    "abstract": "Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function, making this class of transcript attractive for targeted cancer therapy. However, the vast majority of lncRNAs have not been tested as potential therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of currently used cancer treatments. Malignant glioma is rapidly fatal, and ionizing radiation is part of the current standard-of-care used to slow tumor growth in both adult and pediatric patients. Results We use CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to screen 5689 lncRNA loci in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, identifying 467 hits that modify cell growth in the presence of clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation. Thirty-three of these lncRNA hits sensitize cells to radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric gliomas, nine of these hits are prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers ( lncGRS ). Knockdown of lncGRS-1 , a primate-conserved, nuclear-enriched lncRNA, inhibits the growth and proliferation of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but not the viability of normal brain cells. Using human brain organoids comprised of mature neural cell types as a three-dimensional tissue substrate to model the invasive growth of glioma, we find that antisense oligonucleotides targeting lncGRS-1 selectively decrease tumor growth and sensitize glioma cells to radiation therapy. Conclusions These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the vast non-coding genome to enhance radiation therapy.",

                "The human genome produces many thousands of lncRNAs [1\u20133]\u2014transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode for proteins\u2014and certain lncRNAs play key roles in the pathogenesis of cancer [4\u20137]. LncRNAs exhibit highly cell type-specific expression and function [1, 8], making this class of transcripts attractive for targeted cancer therapy. However, it is currently not possible to predict which of these non-coding transcripts would be effective therapeutic targets, let alone those that could sensitize cancer cells to radiation. To rapidly develop lncRNAs as a class of targets for cancer therapy, systematic functional screens are necessary.",
                "CRISPR-based technologies have enabled genome-scale screens of gene function in mammalian cells [8\u201316]. These screening methods have been valuable to the identification of genes\u2014non-coding in addition to coding\u2014that are essential for various cellular phenotypes. However, whether such screen-identified hits can increase the efficacy of ionizing radiation\u2014a critical adjunctive cancer therapy for many malignancies\u2014has not been systematically studied at large scale.",
                "Malignant glioma\u2014a primary cancer of the central nervous system (CNS)\u2014is a fatal diagnosis for most patients [17]. Despite surgery and adjuvant therapy such as fractionated radiation, adults with glioblastoma (GBM) have a median survival of only 14\u2009months [18, 19]. In children, the most common malignant glioma is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). DIPG is primarily treated with radiotherapy, but median survival is only 9\u201310\u2009months, and few patients survive more than 2\u00a0years after diagnosis [20\u201322]. While radiation is a critical component of the treatment of both adult and pediatric malignant gliomas by reducing tumor growth [19, 23, 24], the toxicity of radiation to normal brain cells limits the total dose that can be delivered, and glioma cells that survive radiation lead to tumor recurrence. Thus, therapeutics that increase the efficacy of radiation without reducing the viability of normal brain cells would be of critical clinical benefit, complementing the current standard-of-care for nearly all patients with malignant gliomas.",
                "Organoids are miniature three-dimensional (3D) representations of their in vivo counterpart organs, and organoid-based models of cancer are emerging as a useful platform for the evaluation of therapeutics [25]. Human brain organoids have been generated from pluripotent stem cell (PSC) populations, mimicking early stages of fetal brain development [26\u201328]. Such embryonic brain organoids have been useful to study the genetic mutations that cause GBM [29] and can also serve as a 3D tissue substrate for the growth of glial tumors [30]. However, embryonic brain organoids do not closely represent the mature brain tissue of glioma patients, limiting their utility for assessing potential drug toxicity to normal adult brain cells.",
                "Here, we developed a radiation modifier screen using CRISPRi to identify specific lncRNAs that sensitize glioma cells to radiotherapy. In this screen of 5689 lncRNA loci, 467 hits were found to modify cell growth in the presence of radiation. Thirty-three of these hits sensitized cells to clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiation, and based on their expression in adult and pediatric glioma, nine of these hits were prioritized as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS). Knockdown of lncGRS-1 (CTC-338\u2009M12.4 located on chromosome 5 q35.3) inhibited the growth of primary adult and pediatric glioma cells, but the viability of normal brain cells was not harmed. While lncGRS-1 is primate-conserved, this lncRNA does not exist in rodents, making traditional in vivo mouse models of glioma suboptimal for assessing potential toxicity of lncGRS-1 knockdown in normal brain tissue. We therefore developed a novel human brain organoid model of malignant glioma. To mimic the brains of patients, we assembled \u201cmature\u201d human brain organoids (MBOs) from mature neural cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and human glioma cells grew invasively within these 3D tissues. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting lncGRS-1 selectively decreased tumor growth and sensitized glioma cells to radiation therapy. These studies identify lncGRS-1 as a glioma-specific therapeutic target and establish a generalizable approach to rapidly identify novel therapeutic targets in the vast non-coding genome."

                        "To systematically identify lncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets that sensitize malignant glioma to radiotherapy, we developed a radiation modifier screen using CRISPRi for gene knockdown. CRISPRi represses transcription via the recruitment of catalytically \u201cdead\u201d Cas9 protein fused to the KRAB repressor (dCas9-KRAB), which is targeted to transcriptional start sites (TSS) by a single guide RNA (sgRNA) [11, 31, 32]. For the screen, we used a workhorse GBM cell line (U87) engineered to stably express dCas9-KRAB (U87-dCas9-KRAB) to identify hits for subsequent study in patient-derived cultures of pediatric and adult forms of malignant glioma.",
                        "First, we sought to determine a radiation dose and delivery schedule in U87-dCas9-KRAB cells that enables the discovery of radiation-effect modifiers. For the treatment of human GBM patients, the total radiation dose is typically delivered in ~\u20092\u2009Gy daily fractions [18, 19]. When 2\u2009Gy was delivered to U87-dCas9-KRAB cells as a single dose, cell proliferation transiently decreased but returned to normal after 8\u201310\u00a0days (Fig.\u00a01a). A single dose of 4 or 8\u2009Gy had correspondingly stronger and more prolonged inhibitory effects upon cell proliferation (Fig.\u00a01a), and RNA-seq analysis revealed dose-dependent gene expression changes including induction of the p53 pathway and repression of DNA replication (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S1a). However, these higher single doses exceed those typically used for patients with malignant glioma. Thus, we also tested a total radiation dose of 8\u2009Gy delivered in 2\u2009Gy fractions given every other day (8\u2009Gy in 4 fractions). This 8\u2009Gy fractionated dose increased the cell doubling time by approximately 2-fold, which is an effect size approximating LD50 (Fig.\u00a01a), which allows optimal discovery of both synergistic and buffering screen hits [33], while still utilizing a clinically relevant fractional dose of 2\u2009Gy. Fig. 1A glioma cell culture model for identifying radiation sensitizers. a Doubling time of U87 GBM cells in culture after treatment with different amounts of single-dose or fractionated radiation. Fractionated (fx) radiation (8\u2009Gy in 4 fx) was delivered in 2\u2009Gy doses every other day (n\u2009=\u20093 biological replicates per condition; error bar\u2009=\u2009SD). b, c Internally controlled growth assays for U87 cells evaluating CRISPRi knockdown of ERCC6L2 with (b) and without (c) radiation (n\u2009=\u20093 biological replicates per condition; error bar\u2009=\u2009SD; two-tailed Student\u2019s t test of end points; radiation delivery timepoints indicated below the x-axis)",
                        "We next tested whether U87-dCas9-KRAB cells treated with 8\u2009Gy fractionated radiation can reveal radiation sensitization effects with CRISPRi gene targeting. The inhibition of DNA repair pathways is known to potentiate the therapeutic effects of radiation in cancer cells [34, 35]. In internally controlled growth assays [8, 11], two distinct CRISPRi sgRNAs targeting the DNA damage repair gene ERCC6L2 [36, 37] reduced cell growth in U87 cells treated with 8\u2009Gy fractionated radiation (Fig.\u00a01b). Without radiation treatment, CRISPRi targeting of ERCC6L2 did not reduce cell growth (Fig.\u00a01c). Thus, CRISPRi targeting of the DNA repair gene ERCC6L2 produces a strong radiation sensitization effect in this in vitro model of fractionated radiotherapy."

                        "Although disruption of known DNA repair pathways is an intriguing avenue for novel therapeutics, accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage may paradoxically increase cancer risk [38, 39]. The human genome produces thousands of lncRNAs that represent a large set of novel potential therapeutic targets. We screened the function of 5689 lncRNAs expressed in human glioma by leveraging our CRISPRi Non-Coding Library [8], selecting 10 sgRNAs for each lncRNA TSS and cloning this pool of 56,890 sgRNAs into lentiviral vectors along with 1202 non-targeting control sgRNAs (Fig.\u00a02a). We used this lentiviral sgRNA library to infect two replicates of U87-dCas9-KRAB cultures, selected for infected cells with puromycin, treated cultures with 8\u2009Gy fractionated radiation, then continued cell propagation for a total of 12\u2009days. The proportion of sgRNA positive cells remained stable throughout the screen, indicating that CRISPRi targeting does not exhibit non-specific toxicity even after radiation treatment (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S2a).

Eight Gy radiation was delivered in 4 fractions throughout the screen. b Volcano plot of radiation growth phenotypes (average of two replicate screens) for the top 3 sgRNAs targeting each lncRNA TSS (x-axis) and negative log10(Mann-Whitney U p value) of all sgRNAs for a given gene at T12 as compared to T0 (y-axis). Screen threshold was determined by the product of the x- and y-axes that resulted in an empirical FDR of 0.0025. Neighbor hits are defined as any lncRNA hit with an expressed protein coding gene within 1\u2009kb of the lncRNA TSS. Phenotype refers to the relative log2 enrichment of barcodes in the final timepoint divided by the enrichment of barcodes at the initial timepoint [8, 11]. c Comparison of screen scores, defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs against a given gene multiplied by the negative log10(Mann-Whitney U p value) for that gene, from screens conducted without radiation (x-axis) with scores from screens conducted with radiation (y-axis), with thresholds set at 5 (FDR\u2009=\u20090.0025).

Sensitizer score is defined as the ratio of the radiation modifier screen score in irradiated cells to the growth screen score in non-irradiated cells",
                        "Targeted next generation sequencing of sgRNA barcodes performed at the beginning and end of the screen (~\u20097.1 cell doublings) identified 652 loci that modified cell growth and proliferation in the presence of radiation as compared to the effect of radiation alone (FDR\u2009=\u20090.25%). One hundred eighty-five of these lncRNA TSS hits were within 1\u2009kb of an expressed protein-coding gene and therefore conservatively labeled as \u201cneighbor hits,\u201d with the 1\u2009kb window around the TSS being based on analyses of CRISPRi mechanism and maximum effective distance for knockdown [8, 11]. These neighbor hits were removed from further analysis, leaving 467 \u201clncRNA hits\u201d that modified the propagation of radiation-treated U87 cells (Fig.\u00a02b; Additional\u00a0file\u00a02: Table S1). Interestingly, CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of the lncRNA PVT1 protected cells against the effect of radiation (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S2b), consistent with PVT1 acting as a negative regulator of MYC [40]. The other 466 lncRNA hits negatively affected cell culture growth when combined with radiation.",
                        "To identify lncRNA hits that sensitized cells to the effect of radiation, we compared the screen scores (defined as the average phenotype of the top three sgRNAs against a given gene multiplied by the negative log10(Mann-Whitney U p value) for that gene) for the radiation modifier screen with the growth screen scores from U87 cells that were not irradiated [8]. Phenotype in these CRISPRi screens refers to the relative log2 enrichment of barcodes in the final timepoint divided by the enrichment of barcodes at the initial timepoint [8, 11]. Thirty three hits identified in both screens had screen scores that were greater in the radiation modifier screen (Fig.\u00a02c). Interestingly, the expression of these 33 sensitizer lncRNA hits tended to be downregulated following exposure to 8\u2009Gy of radiation (Pearson\u2019s R\u2009=\u20090.36), which was not observed for the larger set of 467 hits (Pearson\u2019s R\u2009=\u20090.079) (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S2c), suggesting that transcriptional repression following radiation may be a common feature of lncRNA radiosensitizers. Nine of these 33 sensitizer hits were expressed in a panel of various malignant glioma cells including both adult GBM (U87, SF10360, SF10281) and pediatric DIPG (SF8628, SF10218). We ranked these nine hits by a \u201csensitizer score,\u201d which we defined as the ratio of the radiation modifier screen score in irradiated cells to the growth screen score in non-irradiated cells, and denoted these genes as lncRNA Glioma Radiation Sensitizers (lncGRS) 1 to 9 (Fig.\u00a02d). To more accurately survey the transcript structure(s) of these hits, we performed long-read single molecule native RNA sequencing using the Oxford Nanopore PromethION and defined transcript variants and splice boundaries of lncGRS-1 through lncGRS-9 (Fig.\u00a03a, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S3).

Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type of the human brain [45] and are phenotypically related to subpopulations of malignant glioma [46, 47]. We therefore next investigated the effect of lncGRS-1 knockdown in cultures of normal human astrocytes (NHAs) [48].

                        "To investigate the glioma-specific phenotype of lncGRS-1, we performed RNA-seq analysis following ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown. In GBM (U87), DIPG (SF8628), and NHA cells, lncGRS-1 expression was decreased by 80\u201388% 24\u2009h after ASO treatment (Fig.\u00a05e). Consistent with the changes in viability and apoptosis observed with lncGRS-1 knockdown, both GBM and DIPG cells exhibited transcriptome-wide differential gene expression (984 and 3600 genes adj. p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively; Fig.\u00a05e, Additional\u00a0file\u00a04: Table S3). Upregulated genes in U87 and SF8628 were enriched for p53 signaling and apoptosis, while downregulated genes were enriched for cell cycle and DNA damage response (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S5c). Despite different gene ontology terms, differentially expressed genes between U87 and SF8628 cells were positively correlated following knockdown of lncGRS-1 (Pearson\u2019s R\u2009=\u20090.667; Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S5d). Consistent with these genome-wide changes, levels of CDKN1A (p21) increased at the level of both mRNA and protein following lncGRS-1 knockdown in U87 cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S5e,f, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S6). These cells also exhibited decreased proportions of G2/M phase in population-level flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a05d). Interestingly, while lncGRS-1 knockdown resulted in increased p53BP1 foci in U87 cells in the absence of radiation, \u03b3H2AX foci induced by radiation were potentiated by knockdown of lncGRS-1, yet lncGRS-1 knockdown in the absence of radiation did not generate additional \u03b3H2AX foci (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S5g,h). Remarkably, while ASOs were effective for lncGRS-1 knockdown in NHA, such genome-wide changes to the transcriptome were not observed in these non-tumorigenic cells (Fig.\u00a05e)."

                        "While the genomic sequences of lncGRS-1 are conserved across primates, orthologs of this lncRNA do not exist in lower vertebrates such as mice, chicken, and zebrafish (Fig.\u00a03a, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S3). Therefore, evaluating the potential toxicity of lncGRS-1 knockdown in normal postnatal brain necessitates an alternative to xenograft mouse models. Recent studies have shown that embryonic cerebral organoids can serve as 3D tissue \u201chosts\u201d for the growth of human glioma cells [30]. However, such embryonic brain organoids are comprised mostly of immature, proliferative neural progenitors and contain very few astrocytes [50\u201352], which are a type of glia essential to neuronal viability and function [53]. We therefore generated \u201cmature\u201d human brain organoids (MBOs) that more closely reflect the differentiated cellular state of the postnatal human brain (Fig.\u00a06a).

Boxplots represent 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile with whiskers\u2009=\u2009range",
                        "Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type of the adult human brain [53]. We generated pure populations of mature human astrocytes from human iPSCs (iAstrocytes) using a protocol that allows maturation for at least 6\u00a0months [54, 55]. Using an isogenic iPSC (WTC11) clone that carries an inducible Neurogenin2 (NGN2) transgene, we also generated homogenous cultures of mature cortical neurons (i3Neurons) with NGN2 induction [54, 56]. MBOs can be formed from iAstrocytes and i3Neurons by mixing and co-culture of these cell types in defined numbers and ratios (from a 1:1 ratio to solely iAstrocytes or i3Neurons) (Fig.\u00a06a) [55].",
                        "To build upon our studies of NHAs in 2D culture, we first studied MBOs assembled from iAstrocytes (A-MBOs). Unlike astrocytes in 2D culture, iAstrocytes in MBOs become highly ramified and develop complex structures similar to those observed in human brain tissue [55]. Transfection of A-MBOs with ASOs against lncGRS-1 was effective for its knockdown as assessed by both in situ hybridization, demonstrating depletion of lncGRS-1 within nuclei (Fig.\u00a06b), and RT-qPCR (Fig.\u00a06c, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7a). Similar to our results from NHAs in 2D culture (Fig.\u00a05a\u2013c), ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown in A-MBOs did not reduce organoid viability or increase apoptosis (Fig.\u00a06d).",
                        "We next used A-MBOs as the \u201chost\u201d for human glioma tumor growth (Fig.\u00a06e). After DIPG SF8628 cells labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) were seeded to the surface of these MBOs, RFP+ tumors grew progressively larger within the organoid tissue in an invasive manner, when individually monitored using serial microscopic imaging (Fig.\u00a06f). For treatment of a human CNS disease, ASOs are administered weekly directly into the cerebrospinal space [57]. Mimicking this dosing schedule, we added ASOs into the organoid culture media every 7\u2009days. In each organoid, the growth of RFP+ tumors was prospectively imaged (Fig.\u00a06f, g), and tumor burden was estimated by quantification of the RFP signal. ASOs against lncGRS-1 reduced DIPG tumor growth as compared to non-targeting, negative control ASOs (Fig.\u00a06h). Consistent with our results of organoid viability and apoptosis without infiltrated tumor cells (Fig.\u00a06d), the overall size of the host brain organoid was not changed by lncGRS-1 knockdown (Fig.\u00a06i).",
                        "We further developed the MBO-glioma model by using MBOs assembled from both iAstrocytes and i3Neurons (AN-MBOs) and also including radiation therapy. ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 did not affect the viability of AN-MBOs (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7b). Furthermore, treatment of AN-MBOs with clinically therapeutic levels of fractionated radiation (total dose up to 54\u2009Gy), with or without lncGRS-1 knockdown, did not affect the overall size of organoids over a period of 3\u2009weeks (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7c). Using this AN-MBO model of radiotherapy, we investigated whether lncGRS-1 knockdown sensitizes glioma cells to the therapeutic effects of radiation. RFP-labeled U87 cells were seeded to the surface of individual AN-MBOs isolated across multiple wells of a 96-well dish, and tumors grew invasively (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7d) and progressively larger when treated with negative control ASOs and no radiation when tracked using serial microscopic imaging (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7e). As expected, radiation treatment alone (control ASOs with increasing doses of radiation) exhibited a trend of tumor inhibition (Fig.\u00a06j). Notably, when radiation (18\u2009Gy in 9 fractions, or 12\u2009Gy in 6 fractions) was combined with ASO-mediated lncGRS-1 knockdown, the tumor burden was significantly lower than that observed with radiation alone (Fig.\u00a06j, Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Fig. S7e). Thus, ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 sensitizes malignant glioma to the therapeutic effects of radiation in this 3D model of tumor growth."

                "In this study, we developed a CRISPRi-based pooled screening platform to discover novel non-coding therapeutic targets in human malignant glioma that can enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. Given that CRISPRi is effective in a wide range of cancer cell types [8], our work presents a conceptual and experimental framework that can be used to rapidly interrogate new targets in multiple, clinically relevant treatment combinations (e.g., synthetic lethality with traditional chemotherapy and/or radiation, or with newer classes of targeted therapeutics). The prioritization of combinatorial therapeutic targets for preclinical development is increasingly needed, particularly for malignant glioma [58\u201360]. While we focused on lncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in glioma, the overall strategy described here could be easily adapted to screen other types of non-coding genomic elements as well as coding genes.",
                "The interaction between radiation treatment and any particular biological target can be difficult to predict, especially when the mechanism of action of the target is not fully understood. In our study of lncRNAs, of the 467 screen hits that reduced the growth of irradiated GBM cells, only 33 hits behaved as sensitizers (having effect sizes greater with fractionated radiotherapy than without radiation). Interestingly, some lncRNA hits that reduced the growth of non-irradiated GBM cells appeared to ameliorate the effect of radiation (Fig.\u00a02c). These results highlight the importance of unbiased functional genomic methods such as CRISPRi-based pooled screening, particularly when investigating new classes of potential therapeutic targets.",
                "Our systematic approach prioritized lncGRS-1 as a top radiation sensitizer for malignant glioma. Knockdown of lncGRS-1 with either CRISPRi or ASOs inhibited the growth of both adult and pediatric forms of malignant glioma, potentiating the therapeutic effects of clinically relevant doses of fractionated radiotherapy. Therefore, lncGRS-1 shares properties both of an essential gene that is required for normal growth and also a radiation sensitizer target. However, despite being expressed in non-malignant brain cells, lncGRS-1 knockdown did not appear to adversely affect their viability or growth. Of particular note, ASO-mediated knockdown of lncGRS-1 in NHA\u2014cells that proliferate as briskly as the patient-derived glioma cells\u2014did not impair the growth of this non-malignant glial cell type, nor did lncGRS-1 knockdown affect growth of the malignant but non-glioma cell line HeLa. While the transcriptomes of GBM and DIPG cells were broadly perturbed by lncGRS-1 knockdown, only 17 genes were differentially expressed (with lncGRS-1 being the most significant) in NHAs with the same ASO-mediated knockdown. The mechanisms underlying this glioma-specific function of lncGRS-1 remain to be discovered, but upon lncGRS-1 knockdown, we did observe activation of the p53 signaling pathway leading to upregulation of p53 effectors such as p21, correlating with a decrease in cell cycle progression. Our observations here build importantly on previous genome-scale studies that reveal essential lncRNAs as having exquisitely cell type-specific function [8, 61, 62]. Based on this emerging understanding of lncRNA biology, we speculate that lncRNAs as a class are enriched for targets that have important roles selectively in malignant cells.",
                "Modeling human glioma in mice as transplanted xenografts is time-consuming and relatively expensive, particularly for early preclinical studies intended to screen new drugs for therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity [25]. Furthermore, certain human therapeutic targets do not exist in animal hosts\u2014as is the case for lncGRS-1\u2014decreasing the utility of animal models for assessing potential toxicity stemming from the ablation of such targets in normal tissue. Human organoids represent a medium-throughput platform for cancer studies [63], and our studies demonstrate the utility of MBOs for simultaneously evaluating treatment efficacy and brain toxicity, including in the context of current radiotherapy treatment paradigms.",
                "As a 3D tissue platform for the study of human glioma, MBOs offer certain characteristics that distinguish them from embryonic brain organoids and GBM-derived tumor organoids. In contrast to embryonic brain organoids that mimic early stages of fetal brain development, MBOs are assembled from cell populations that are more mature and postmitotic [54, 55]. Because embryonic brain organoids contain a large proportion of proliferative precursor cells, radiation treatment and/or other traditional chemotherapies may not be well-tolerated by such normal but immature cells. GBM-derived tumor organoids are useful for the study of drug efficacy in 3D tissues, but because they are comprised of only tumor cells, toxicity to normal cells and therefore the therapeutic index [64] cannot be assessed. Because of these differences, it is likely that each organoid platform will have important utility in different preclinical research scenarios. As a bridge between in vitro and in vivo preclinical experiments intended to prioritize drug candidates and therapeutic targets, MBOs have shown utility in our study, identifying lncGRS-1 as a target for further preclinical development such as in vivo validation. One limitation of our MBO-glioma model is the absence of a complete tumor microenvironment, which includes microglia, stromal cells, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, among other cell types [65, 66]. However, recent advances in tumor organoid derivation have demonstrated preservation of syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and stromal fibroblasts along with neoplastic cells using an air liquid interface [67]. Analogous strategies, in addition to the incorporation of vascular endothelial cells, may further augment the experimental utility of MBOs in future iterations."

                "There is an unmet need for cancer therapies that potentiate the therapeutic effects of radiation therapy while minimizing toxicity [59]. Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatment modalities for all cancers, and it is nearly always indicated for patients with malignant glioma [23]. The development of drug-radiotherapy combinations has generally been pursued with low-throughput, non-systematic approaches [60]. Our genome-scale CRISPRi-based radiation modifier screen of lncRNA loci in glioma demonstrates a strategy for revealing novel therapeutic targets in this vast, largely unexplored aspect of the non-coding genome. More broadly, we anticipate that the coupling of large-scale screening efforts with target validation in MBO models will serve as a useful framework for accelerating the development of new therapeutics (and combinations) through the preclinical research pipeline."

Phenotype in these CRISPRi screens refer to the relative log2 enrichment of barcodes in the final timepoint divided by the enrichment of barcodes at the initial timepoint, as has been previously described [8, 11]. A screen score threshold of 5, which corresponded to an empirical false discovery rate of 0.25%, was applied to both screens, and hits with radiation scores greater than growth scores were retained.
