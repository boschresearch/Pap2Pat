                        "Therapeutics that direct powerful effector functions of the immune system towards target cells hold great promise in settings of therapeutic resistance of infectious diseases and cancer. The complement system is an ancient and well-conserved branch of innate immunity which recognizes and clears pathogens by direct lysis, opsonization, and recruitment of effector cells. Targeting these activities to target organisms and/or cells associated with disease can provide a novel modality to add to the therapeutic arsenal.",
                        "Classical complement activation is initiated by the C1 complex, composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s proteins. C1q is a hexameric protein comprised of one stalk domain and six head domains which recognize molecular patterns on cell surfaces, as well as antigen-antibody complexes via binding to IgG1 or IgG3 Fc domains. C1q binds to individual Fc domains with low affinity, but antigen-induced multimerization of Fc domains results in avidity-driven enhancement of C1q binding. The ensuing serine protease cascade results in sequential recruitment and cleavage of complement components that culminates in the insertion of the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b9) pore causing rapid loss of cell viability. Cell-surface bound C1q can also be directly recognized by C1q binding proteins or a C1q receptor on a variety of effector cells leading to phagocytosis or cytotoxicity.",
                        "Directed complement recruitment has not been effectively harnessed for broad therapeutic application. To date, therapeutic antibodies engaging complement do so via their IgG1 Fc domains and therefore potency is dependent on the density and geometry of antibody binding to the target antigen. For example, anti-CD20 IgG1 mAbs, such as rituximab, induce complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) [e.g. MAC-mediated lysis] of CD20-expressing B cells in vitro, with potency related to CD20 density. However in vivo, the relative contribution of CDC versus effector cell-mediated death such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is unknown.",
                        "Thus, there is a need to develop compositions and methods for enhancing complement deposition and mediating cytotoxicity of bacterial, mammalian and virally-infected target cells."

One antigen-binding domain (D1) specifically binds to a target antigen. In some embodiments, the target antigen is on the surface of a cell or an organism, e.g., an antigen on the surface of a bacterium or an antigen on the surface of a eukaryotic cell. The cell may be any type of cell, e.g., from any tissue or organ, stem cell, progenitor cell, differentiated cell, etc. In some embodiments, the target antigen is a soluble target antigen, i.e., not bound to a cell. The other antigen-binding domain (D2) specifically binds to a component of the complement pathway (\u201ccomplement component\u201d), e.g., C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, or a subunit or fragment thereof.",

A single amino acid substitution in the hinge region of the human IgG4 hinge can significantly reduce the appearance of the second form (Angal et al. (1993) Molecular Immunology 30:105) to levels typically observed using a human IgG1 hinge. The instant disclosure encompasses antibodies having one or more mutations in the hinge, CH2 or CH3 region which may be desirable, for example, in production, to improve the yield of the desired antibody form.",
                                "The antibodies of the disclosure may be isolated antibodies. An \u201cisolated antibody,\u201d as used herein, means an antibody that has been identified and separated and/or recovered from at least one component of its natural environment. For example, an antibody that has been separated or removed from at least one component of an organism, or from a tissue or cell in which the antibody naturally exists or is naturally produced, is an \u201cisolated antibody\u201d for purposes of the present disclosure. An isolated antibody also includes an antibody in situ within a recombinant cell. Isolated antibodies are antibodies that have been subjected to at least one purification or isolation step. According to certain embodiments, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.",
                                "The anti-C1q, anti-target antigen, or bispecific antigen binding molecules disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences from which the antibodies were derived. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present disclosure includes antigen binding molecules, antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as \u201cgermline mutations\u201d). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antigen binding molecules, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the VH and/or VL domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antigen binding molecules, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the present disclosure may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antigen binding molecules, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired properties such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antigen binding molecules, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present disclosure.",
                                "The present disclosure also includes one-arm antibodies that bind C1q, IsdB, Ps1, Influenza HA, CD20, Protein A, IsdA, PNAG, C1fA, or GITR. As used herein, a \u201cone-arm antibody\u201d means an antigen-binding molecule comprising a single antibody heavy chain and a single antibody light chain. The one-arm antibodies of the present disclosure may comprise any of the HCVR/LCVR or CDR amino acid sequences as set forth in Tables 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 18 herein.",
                                "The term \u201cepitope\u201d refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.",
                                "The term \u201csubstantial identity\u201d or \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d when referring to a nucleic acid or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 90%, e.g., at least about 95%, and more preferably at least about 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotide bases, as measured by any well-known algorithm of sequence identity, such as FASTA, BLAST or Gap, as discussed below. A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same or substantially similar amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic acid molecule.",
                                "As applied to polypeptides, the term \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar\u201d means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 90% sequence identity, e.g., at least 95% sequence identity, even more preferably at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson (1994) Methods Mol. Biol. 24: 307-331, herein incorporated by reference. Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as Gap and Bestfit which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutant thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson (2000) supra). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the disclosure to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 and Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-402, each herein incorporated by reference."

As used herein, a \u201cmultimerizing domain\u201d is any macromolecule, protein, polypeptide, peptide, or amino acid that has the ability to associate with a second multimerizing domain of the same or similar structure or constitution. For example, a multimerizing domain may be a polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin CH3 domain. A non-limiting example of a multimerizing component is an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin (comprising a CH2-CH3 domain), e.g., an Fc domain of an IgG selected from the isotypes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, as well as any allotype within each isotype group.",

In other embodiments, the multimerizing domain is a cysteine residue, or a short cysteine-containing peptide. Other multimerizing domains include peptides or polypeptides comprising or consisting of a leucine zipper, a helix-loop motif, or a coiled-coil motif. In embodiments, a multimerizing domain can include an amino acid alteration in the CH3 region that cause a knob to be formed on one multimerization domain and an amino acid alteration in the CH3 region that cause a corresponding hole on another multimerization domain that provides for pairing of the multimerization domains. In embodiments, amino acid alterations can provide for charge pairing of the two multimerization domains.",

These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTIN\u2122, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax.

The preferred dose is typically calculated according to body weight or body surface area. When a bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the present disclosure is used for therapeutic purposes in an adult patient, it may be advantageous to administer (e.g., intravenously administer or subcutaneously administer) the bispecific antigen-binding molecule of the present disclosure normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. Effective dosages and schedules for administering a bispecific antigen-binding molecule may be determined empirically; for example, patient progress can be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Moreover, interspecies scaling of dosages can be performed using well-known methods in the art (e.g., Mordenti et al., 1991, Pharmaceut. Res. 8:1351).",

Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device.

To better understand how complement affects Gram-positive organisms, S. aureus incubated with either 50% NHS (FIG. 1a), which is closer to physiological levels than previously tested, or media (FIG. 1b) was visualized. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed striking differences to the surface of S. aureus after 8 h of incubation with NHS (FIG. 1a). Complement deposition on S. aureus in the presence of NHS but not media was confirmed (data not shown).",
                                "Bacteria were incubated with 50% NHS, 50% CS-depleted serum, or media for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. Complement deposition was visualized using a primary antibody specific for C1q, C3, or a neo-epitope that forms upon C5b9 complex formation. In the presence of 50% NHS, surface-bound C1q, C3, and C5b9 proteins were observed (data not shown) with similar distribution. Depletion of CS resulted in C1q and C3 deposition, but not C5b9, indicating the need for a complete terminal pathway for C5b9 formation.",
                                "Incubation with NHS resulted in killing of S. aureus and is dependent on an intact terminal complement pathway (FIG. 2). For this experiment, bacteria were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0 C. with a more physiological concentration of serum, 50% NHS, or 50% NHS depleted of individual terminal complement components (C1q, CS, C6, C7, C8, or C9). In 50% NHS viable bacteria were reduced 100-fold compared to media alone, as measured by serial dilution and plating (FIG. 2). Similar results were observed when ATP release was used to quantify viable bacteria (FIG. 4). When serum was depleted of C1q or any terminal complement component (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9; FIG. 2), growth was restored comparable to levels seen in media, confirming that S. aureus killing is dependent on formation of the MAC. Furthermore, incubation of S. aureus with NHS, but not serum depleted of C1q or CS, resulted in uptake of a viability dye, propidium iodide (PI) (FIG. 3). S. aureus was incubated with 50% NHS, 50% C1q-depleted serum, or 50% CS-depleted serum for 0, 10, or 24 h followed by addition of PI. While the level of PI staining was similar at 0 h, at 24 h there was a significant increase in the amount of PI taken up in the NHS treated samples indicating loss of viability which was not observed in complement depleted sera (FIG. 3). This indicates that complement activation can directly reduce the viability of S. aureus.",

                                "After demonstrating that complement can kill S. aureus, a strategy was developed to increase both complement deposition and bacterial killing. A C1q-targeting bsAb was tested to determine if it could recruit C1q, enhance complement deposition, and activate complement independent of antigen density and the geometry of antibody binding. Engagement of multiple C1q globular heads to target antigens is required for complement activation and MAC deposition. Furthermore, multiple MAC pores are required to efficiently kill target cells. To circumvent this, a fully human IgG1 bsAb was designed to recruit C1q directly to the S. aureus surface. The well-characterized, highly conserved, and abundant bacterial surface protein iron-regulated surface determinant protein B (IsdB) was selected as the target. VelocImmune\u2122 mice were immunized with purified human C1q and recombinant S. aureus IsdB as described in Example 11 to generate fully human antibodies against these two antigens. IsdB binding arms were paired with multiple C1q effector arms and the bsAbs with maximal S. aureus killing activity in serum killing assays were selected.",
                                "The unique binding properties of the anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb were characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-Biacore, as shown in Table 19.",
                                "The bsC1q x IsdB and the parental bivalent anti-IsdB antibody were captured on the sensor chip surface and IsdB.6\u00d7(His) was injected over the surfaces at 37\u00b0 C. Both bsC1q x IsdB and bivalent antibodies had nanomolar affinity for IsdB. When IsdB.6\u00d7(His) or IsdA.6\u00d7(His) were captured on the chip surface and bsC1q x IsdB and bsC1q x IsdA were injected over the surface of the chip, both bispecific antibodies had nanomolar affinity for their respective antigens. Human C1q was biotinylated and captured on the chip at low density, and the bsC1q x IsdB was injected, resulting in a Kd of 3.67 \u03bcM, reflecting the interaction in solution. To mimic the surface of S. aureus, IsdB.6\u00d7(His) was first captured on the chip surface, followed by injection of the bsC1q x IsdB, and finally C1q, and the dissociation of C1q was measured. In this format, the affinity to C1q increased to 3.23 nM. The 1000-fold tighter binding results from avidity-driven interactions between the anti-C1q arm and multiple C1q heads.",
                                "Anti-IsdB x anti-C1q also dramatically increased recruitment of C1q to S. aureus. C1q deposition was measured on the surface of S. aureus Newman \u0394spa (a methicillin-sensitive strain, MSSA) resulting from binding of anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb, the bivalent IsdB antibody, or an isotype control antibody. While minimal C1q deposition was observed with the bivalent or isotype control antibody, incubation with anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb resulted in robust, dose-dependent increase in C1q deposited on S. aureus (EC50=127 pM; FIG. 5).",
                                "As shown in Table 20, multiple anti-C1q bispecific antibodies bound to S. aureus using ELISA. S. aureus Newman \u0394spa was coated onto ELISA plates; incubated with a titration of the anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb, the bivalent IsdB antibody, anti-IsdA x anti-C1q bsAb, anti-PNAG x anti-C1q bsAb, anti-C1fA x anti-C1q bsAb, anti-protein A x anti-C1q bsAb, or an isotype control antibody; washed; and then binding measurements were made by luminescence (Table 20).",
                                "The functional consequence of bsAb-mediated enhancement of MAC deposition was shown using a whole blood assay, in which anti-IsdB x anti-C1q significantly inhibited S. aureus growth (FIG. 6). While the bivalent IsdB antibody incubated with S. aureus Newman in human blood for 24 h had no effect on bacterial growth, incubation with anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb reduced bacterial growth nearly 10-fold (FIG. 6). This activity was dependent on complement activity: blocking phagocytosis with cytochalasin D had no effect on anti-IsdB x anti-C1q activity, whereas C5 blockade completely abrogated bsAb cytotoxicity (FIG. 6).",
                                "To assess the role of antigen density on the C1q-recruiting bsAb activity, the same C1q-targeting arm was paired with antibody arms targeting Protein A, clumping factor A (C1fA), poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), and IsdA. These S. aureus target antigens are present at different densities on the surface of S. aureus Newman \u0394spa (Table 21), as determined using flow cytometry",
                                "Each of the tested C1q-targeting bispecific antibodies bound C1q and S. aureus with high affinity (Table 22), and increased S. aureus killing compared to the corresponding bivalent antibody (FIG. 7 and Table 23).",
                                "As shown in Table 23, the overall growth in whole human blood in the absence of test antibody is normalized to 100%. Survival of S. aureus in both 68 nM and 680 nM negative isotype control antibodies ranged from 114-146%. S. aureus survival was reduced at least by 50% when treated with 68 nM anti-S. aureus x anti-C1q bispecific antibody compared to its equivalent bivalent anti-S. aureus antibody. When treated with 680 nM anti-S. aureus x anti-C1q bispecific antibody, survival ranged from 4-14%, which was also at least 50% lower than its equivalent bivalent anti-S. aureus antibody, except in the case of IsdA. For IsdA, in one experiment of two, the anti-IsdA x anti-C1q antibody activity was \u02dc40% more than the anti-IsdA bivalent antibody. Thus, with each anti-S. aureus x anti-C1q antibody, there was increased anti-Staphylococcal activity with increased antibody concentration.",
                                "The similar potency of these bsAbs, despite the variability in surface densities (Table 21) of the S. aureus target antigens, indicates that enhancing local concentrations of C1q on the cell surface overcomes the low efficiency of complement-mediated cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that anti-Staphylococcus x anti-C1q antibodies enhance killing of S. aureus and supports a C1q-recruiting bsAb approach to augment complement activity.",

The digested peptide mixture was then separated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC Systems with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH130 C18 column (2.1\u00d750 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm; Waters). 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile were used as mobile phase A and mobile phase B, respectively. Signature peptides unique to human C1q protein sequences were selected from each of the individual C1q subunits (A, B, and C) as surrogate peptides for C1q quantification. Calibration curves for the surrogate peptide from each C1q subunit were generated using a series of concentrations of C1q protein standard (Quidel), which allows the quantitation of total C1q by any of the three subunits based on the assay response of the respective surrogate peptides. Data acquisition by LC-MS/MS under selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode was performed using an Agilent 6495 TripleQuad mass spectrometer with Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization source. Pre-selected mass to charge ratio (m/z) of precursor and product ion pair of each surrogate peptide were fragmented with optimized collision energy and detected in the mass spectrometer. Agilent LC/MS Data Acquisition for 6400 Series Triple Quadrupole, version B.08.00, was used to run the LC/MS system. Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis, version B.06.00, was used for data analysis. In this assay all standards, controls, and test samples were prepared in parallel.",

The S. aureus strains were grown overnight in TSB. The culture was then diluted 1:100 in fresh TSB, grown to log phase (OD600\u02dc1) in TSB at 37\u00b0 C., washed 3 times in PBS and adjusted to the desired density for infection. Where indicated antibiotics were administered starting 18 h following infection. Mice were treated with 110 mg/kg of vancomycin twice daily administered subcutaneously, 50 mg/kg daptomycin once daily administered subcutaneously, or 80 mg/kg linezolid twice daily administered orally (100 \u03bcl volume) on Days 1, 2 and 3. 24 h post infection, mice were administered with a single dose of the indicated antibody or PBS in a 100 \u03bcl volume, intraperitoneally. Mice were weighed daily until day 4 post infection and change in weight was recorded. Mice were euthanized on day 4 and kidneys, heart, liver, lungs and spleen were collected to determine organ burden. Briefly, the organs were homogenized in 5 mL PBS using program \u201cMulti-C\u201d on a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Homogenate was then diluted in PBS and 10-fold serial dilutions were plated on LB agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. overnight. Resultant colonies were counted, and results were reported as CFUs/gram tissue.",

                                "After showing in vitro efficacy of anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb, it was evaluated whether enhanced cytotoxicity could be observed in vivo. Because the anti-C1q arm of the bsAb is specific for human C1q heads, and does not bind mouse C1q, mice were generated that encode the human sequences of the globular head of C1q to enable in vivo efficacy models. Mouse C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC genes were replaced with chimeric versions, in which the N-terminus of the gene encoding the collagen-like tail was mouse sequence, and the C-terminus of the gene encoding the globular head was human. This resulted in a C1q protein that could bind the bsAb while still interacting with the rest of the mouse complement pathway. The genes remained under the control of the native mouse C1q promoter and expression of the chimeric proteins in serum was confirmed by mass spectrometry. On average the mice expressed 28 \u03bcg/mL of chimeric C1q with values ranging from 21 to 37 \u03bcg/mL (FIG. 8).",
                                "Using the C1q humanized mice, it was demonstrated that a single dose of anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb significantly improved clearance of S. aureus in vivo. Prior to infection mice were randomized to have similar average group body weight, then infected intraperitoneally with S. aureus Newman one day later. The day after infection, mice were intraperitoneally dosed with PBS, the bivalent anti-IsdB antibody (25 mg/kg), or varying concentrations of anti-IsdB x anti-C1q (0.5-25 mg/kg). Mice were weighed daily and on Day 4 organs were collected and bacterial burdens determined. One day after infection, the mice in each group lost 10-15% of their body weight. In PBS treated animals, weight loss continued after day 1 (FIG. 9, left panel, red squares), whereas weights of 25 mg/kg anti-IsdB treated mice stabilized after day 1 (FIG. 9, left panel, plum triangles). Remarkably, treatment with as little as 1 mg/kg anti-IsdB x anti-C1q stabilized weight after Day 1, and doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg resulted in weight gains suggesting rapid reduction in bacterial load (FIG. 9, left panel, orange diamonds, circles, and squares).",
                                "At day 4, bacterial burden in the organs was quantified: mice treated with PBS and 25 mg/kg of anti-IsdB bivalent antibody had 108 bacteria per gram in their kidneys (FIG. 9, right panel). Conversely, treatment with as little as 1 mg/kg anti-IsdB x anti-C1q reduced kidney bacterial burden by at least 1-log, with a 4-log reduction observed at the 5 mg/kg dose (FIG. 9, right panel). Furthermore, similar trends in body weight and bacterial organ burdens were observed with a methicillin resistant (MRSA) strain, S. aureus CA127 (FIG. 11). Comparable reductions in bacterial burdens were observed in the hearts, liver, lungs and spleen (FIG. 12-15, respectively). These results demonstrate that a bivalent anti-IsdB IgG1 antibody is not sufficient to clear S. aureus in vivo, while the anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb enhances C1q-dependent complement recruitment and killing.",
                                "A single dose of anti-IsdB x anti-C1q is as effective at reducing S. aureus burden as daily dosing of the standard of care antibiotics vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin. Mice were infected intraperitoneally with S. aureus MW2, a MRSA strain. One day after infection mice were intraperitoneally administered either PBS, 5 mg/kg anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb, or standard of care antibiotics: either 110 mg/kg vancomycin twice daily (b.i.d.) administered subcutaneously, 50 mg/kg daptomycin once daily (q.d.) administered subcutaneously, or 80 mg/kg linezolid twice daily (b.i.d.) administered orally. Mice were weighed daily for 4 days, kidneys were collected, and bacterial burdens determined. While all antibiotics resulted in lower bacterial burdens compared to untreated mice (daptomycin \u02dc330-fold reduction; linezolid \u02dc100-fold reduction), mice treated with either anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bsAb or vancomycin had significantly lower burden of S. aureus in their kidneys, with greater than 500-fold reduction (FIG. 10). A single dose of the bsAb was as effective in clearing bacteria as daily doses of the antibiotics tested.",
                                "To harness the potent killing activity of the complement system for therapeutic potential, we have developed a bispecific antibody platform that recruits C1q to lyse pathogenic cells. To demonstrate the utility of this platform we initially chose S. aureus, an organism thought to be resistant to the cytotoxic effect of MAC. Using the C1q-directed bispecific approach, we enhanced complement deposition and killing in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of C5, a terminal complement component, abrogated the effect, demonstrating a dependence on MAC-mediated lysis. We further showed that this approach works using other S. aureus targets with different densities.",
                                "Gram-positive bacteria are susceptible to direct complement-mediated lysis. MAC was not thought to play a role in control of Gram-positive infections in humans since direct killing had not been observed and both terminal complement deficiencies and blockade of C5 with eculizumab result only in increased susceptibility to the Gram-negative bacteria Neisseria. However, S. aureus do possess terminal complement inhibitors such as SSL7 indicating a role for blocking MAC activity and humans with deficiencies in early complement components (e.g. C1q, C2, C3, C4) are susceptible to multiple bacterial infections including S. aureus. Therefore, the efficacy of our bsAb suggests that increasing localized complement can be harnessed to kill Gram-positive bacteria through the activity of MAC.",

We investigated whether the C1q-recruiting bsAb platform was effective against this pathogen. Binding of the anti-Ps1 x anti-C1q bispecific antibodies of the present disclosure to Ps1 expressed on the surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined in an ELISA based format. Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates (\u02dc85%) express the exopolysaccharide Ps1 protein and a bivalent monoclonal antibody (mAb) to this exopolysaccharide has shown efficacy in mouse models of infection (DiGiandomenico A., et al. J. Exp. Med. 209, 1273-1287 (2012)). Because the exopolysaccharide coats the surface of the bacterium, it can be used as a targeting arm for bispecific antibodies. A bispecific antibody using anti-Ps1 as one arm and anti-C1q as the second arm of the antibody has been generated. Comparison of the binding of the bivalent parent anti-Ps1 mAb versus the anti-Ps1xC1q bispecific antibody to P. aeruginosa was tested.",

Addition of anti-Ps1 x anti-C1q bsAb to P. aeruginosa in human blood resulted in over a 1-log reduction in bacteria after 24 h compared to control or anti-Ps1 bivalent antibody. This result demonstrated that the C1q-recruiting bsAb platform is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and further showed that adding a C1q-recruiting arm to an antibody that lacks intrinsic CDC activity can result in a molecule that leads to significant complement activation.",

                                "The wide-applicability of the C1q-bispecific platform approach was shown by demonstrating targeted killing of both bacterial and mammalian cells. Additionally, this approach overcomes the dependence on the antigen density and orientation of antibody binding to antigen in order to engage multiple C1q heads. The C1q-recruiting bsAb can activate complement when targeted to many different antigens including multiple S. aureus antigens, as well as antigens on P. aeruginosa, influenza-infected mammalian cells, B-cells, and T-cells. The platform should also be widely applicable to patients of different ages, genders, and immune status: the classical complement pathway and its protein components are abundant in circulation and stably expressed, whereas innate immune effector cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and T-cells have impaired function with age. Therefore a C1q-based therapeutic has the potential to be used in immune compromised patients including those on immunosuppressive therapies. Furthermore, the platform may have the potential to enhance the efficacy of existing treatments, such as antibiotics and tumor targeting agents.",
                                "Immunomodulatory therapeutics, including bsAbs, are currently being investigated as powerful ways to eliminate a variety of pathogenic cell types. The C1q-targeting platform disclosed herein represents a novel approach to leverage the cytotoxic effector functions of the immune system. The bsAbs described herein increased complement-mediated killing of bacterial and mammalian cells when targeted to antigens with diverse characteristics. The novel mechanism of this C1q-targeting platform has the possibility to be effective despite resistance mechanisms that can confound existing treatment modalities.",

In contrast, C1q levels were stable throughout the course of the 4 days for uninfected mice administered an anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bispecific antibody comprising an Fc that is an IgG4 Fc or an IgG1 \u201cuber stealth\u201d Fc with reduced or no FcgR interactions (FIG. 21). In infected animals, where the IsdB target is present, there was a 10-35% reduction in circulating C1q concentrations in mice administered the bispecific anti-IsdB x anti-C1q IgG1 antibody, REGN5066 (FIG. 22). Similar to the uninfected animals, for female and male MAID1615 mice administered the IgG4 or IgG1 uber stealth versions of the anti-IsdB x anti-C1q bispecific antibody (REGN5331 or REGN7017, respectively), C1q levels were stable throughout the course of the infection over 4 days (FIG. 22).
