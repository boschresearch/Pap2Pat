    "abstract": "Real-time, short-term analysis of ECG, by using multiple signal processing and machine learning techniques, is used to determine counter shock success in defibrillation. Combinations of measures when used with machine learning algorithms readily predict successful resuscitation, guide therapy and predict complications. In terms of guiding resuscitation, they may serve as indicators and when to provide counter shocks and at what energy levels they should be provided as well as to serve as indicators of when certain drugs should be provided (in addition to their doses). For cardiac arrest, the system is meant to run in real time during all current resuscitation procedures including post-resuscitation care to detect deterioration for guiding care such as therapeutic hypothermia.",

                        "The present invention generally relates to a novel method for analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and other physiologic signals of Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) in order to identify and capitalize on the optimum physiologic moments when resuscitation is most likely and also to guide therapy by making therapeutic recommendations as well as predicting rearrest. More particularly, the invention is an integrative model that performs real-time, short-term analysis of ECG through machine learning techniques.",
                        "2. Background Description",
                        "Sudden cardiac death is a significant public health concern and a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. In the United States cardiac arrest claims greater than 300,000 lives annually. Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remain dismal (cf. G. Nichol, E. Thomas, C. W. Callaway, et al., \u201cRegional variation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence and outcome\u201d, J Am Med Assoc 2008; 300:1423-1431). Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is the initially encountered arrhythmia in 20-30% of cardiac arrest cases (cf. V. M. Nadkarni, G. L. Larkin, M. A. Peberdy, S. M. Carey, W. Kaye, M. E. Mancini, G. Nichol, T. Lane-Truitt, J. Potts, J. P. Ornato, and R. A. Berg. \u201cFirst documented rhythm and clinical outcome from in-hospital cardiac arrest among children and adults\u201d, J Am Med Assoc. 2006; 295:50-57). Multiple reentrant circuits contribute to the VF waveform causing its pathophysiology to be extremely dynamic. A victim's chances of survival worsen by 10% for every minute of VF that remains untreated (cf. T. D. Valenzuela, D. J. Roe, S. Cretin, D. W. Spaite, and M. P. Larsen, \u201cEstimating effectiveness of cardiac arrest interventions: a logistic regression survival model\u201d, Circulation. 1997; 96: 3308-3313). Defibrillation is a procedure that delivers an electrical current that depolarizes a critical mass of the myocardium simultaneously. Defibrillation increases the possibility of the sino-atrial node regaining control of the rhythm. Coronary artery perfusion provided by cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior to defibrillation has been shown to improve chances for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). As victims enter the CPR phase of cardiac arrest, predicting defibrillation success may become paramount to prevent unnecessary interruptions to CPR (cf. M. L. Weisfeldt and L. B. Becker, \u201cResuscitation after cardiac arrest: a 3-phase time-sensitive model\u201d, J Am Med Assoc. 2002; 288 (23)3008-13). Repetitive unsuccessful shocks can reduce chest compression time and can cause injury to cardiac tissue, impacting heart function upon survival. Even worse, unsuccessful shocks can cause VF to deteriorate into asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA), which are more difficult to resuscitate (cf. H. Strohmenger, \u201cPredicting Defibrillation Success\u201d, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, 2008; 14:311-316).",
                        "The effect of acute ischemia on tissue excitability induces conversion of VF from type-1 coarse VF to type-2 smooth VF (cf. A. V. Zaitsev, O. Berenfeld, S. F. Mironov, J. Jalife, and A. M. Pertsov, \u201cDistribution of excitation frequencies on the epicardial and endocardial surfaces of fibrillating ventricular wall of the sheep heart\u201d, Circ Res., 2000; 86:408-417). Type 1 VF has now been correlated with the multiple-wavelet theory, while type-2 has been shown to be driven by a mother rotor (cf. J. N. Weiss, Z. Qu, P. S. Chen, S. F. Lin, H. S. Karagueuzian, H. Hayashi, A. Garfinkel, and A. Karma, \u201cThe Dynamics of Cardiac Fibrillation\u201d, Circulation, 2005; 112:1232-1240). This conversion partially conforms to rapidly attenuating chances of survival with increasing VF duration (cf. J. Eilevstjonn, J. Kramer-Johansen, and K. Sunde, \u201cShock outcome is related to prior rhythm and duration of ventricular fibrillation\u201d, Resuscitation, 2007, 75: 60-6), and can be quantified by any measure that can account for both, a decrease in amplitude and a shift in spectral composition of the signal. Fourier Transform (FT) based measures (cf. G. Ristagno, A. Gullo, G. Berlot, U. Lucangelo, F. Geheb, and J. Bisera, \u201cPrediction of successful defibrillation in human victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective electrocardiographic analysis\u201d, Anaesth Intensive Care 2008; 36: 46-50) assume a linear, deterministic basis for the signals, and prove to be impracticable. Other methods (cf. J. N. Watson, N. Uchaipichat, P. S. Addison, G. R. Clegg, C. E. Robertson, T. Eftestol T, and P. A. Steen, \u201cImproved prediction of defibrillation success for out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest using wavelet transform methods\u201d, Resuscitation 63: 269-275, 2004, and A. Neurauter, T. Eftest\u00f8l, and H-U. Strohmenger. \u201cPrediction of countershock success using single features from multiple ventricular fibrillation frequency bands and feature combinations using neural networks\u201d, Resuscitation 73, 253-263, 2007), with somewhat more feasible definitions of post-shock success, have focused on creating predictive models based on the real Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). While wavelet decomposition has proven to be more effective, clinical transition of such approaches has been precluded due to low specificities.",
                        "Gundersen and colleagues (cf. K. Gundersen et al, \u201cIdentifying approaches to improve the accuracy of shock outcome prediction for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\u201d, Resuscitation. Volume 76, Issue 2, February 2008, Pages 279-284) have shown that predictive features of the VF waveform suffer from random effects, with p-values less than 10-3. This was proved with a mixed effects logistic regression model. Random effect-sizes, calculated as standard deviation of the \u201crandom\u201d term in the model, varied from 73% to 189% of the feature effect-sizes. Thus an additional objective of our work aims at countering the variance due to such effects. We hypothesized that other physiologic signals obtained during CPR, such as end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2), can help build a more \u201ccomplete\u201d model."

Others, however, can be monitored although there is variation among practitioners. These may include but not limited to end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), blood pressure, impedance, airway pressure, central venous oxygen saturation, etc. In addition, more signals may be monitored during the post-resuscitation period after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).",

Features are then selected with a cost-sensitive SVM ranking and a modified wrapper approach for subset selection. Upon selection of features, a parametrically optimized support vector machine (SVM) model was trained with radial basis function kernel for predicting outcomes on the test sets. Training and testing was performed with nested 10-fold cross validation and 6-10 features for each test fold. The approach allows incorporation of a diverse number of physiologic signals, which can be collected during cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts and in the post-resuscitation period to help guide therapy and predict decompensation."

Lack of a clear QRS complex renders traditional methods of ECG analysis, which use physiologic correlates of the detected P, R and T waves, ineffective. Furthermore, during VF, there are continuous variations in amplitude, axis and morphology of the ventricular baseline.",
                        "A \u201cfeature\u201d can be any measure from the raw or modified/filtered/transformed data that is indicative of the underlying physiology/characteristics of the system. We conjectured that factors which can affect shock outcome may be explored by modeling the data through non-linear methods, as well as, by deriving more general statistical measures of the pre-shock signal-segment in multiple domains. Counter to our experience (cf. S. Shandilya, S. Y. Ji, K. R. Ward, and K. Najarian, \u201cPrediction of Shock Outcome Using Signal Processing Machine Learning\u201d, Circulation, 122:A242, 23, November 2010), previous efforts to combine multiple features (cf.

                        "Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to FIG. 1, there is illustrated a block diagram of the Decision Support System which implements the integrative model that performs real-time, short-term analysis of ECG through machine learning techniques according to the invention. Block 10 represents a patient with attached electrodes of an ECG machine. The output of the ECG machine is an ECG signal at 11, and this ECG signal is subjected to preprocessing at 12. The preprocessed signal is then input to multiple signal processing blocks. These include a prototype distance calculation with non-linear characterization block 13, a complex wavelet decomposition block 14 and an attributes from time domain block 15. The outputs of each of these signal processing blocks are input to a feature selection and parameter tuning block 16, the output of which is input to a machine training and classification block 17. This block outputs a report 18 which is displayed on a suitable display device 19.",
                        "FIG. 2 provides an overview of the real-time system. The first step at block A1 is to parse the ECG signal. Then, in block A2, the ECG signal is preprocessed by removing sudden shifts and drifts. Simulataneously, the ETCO2 signal is parsed at block B1, and this signal is preprocessed in block B2 by selecting signals with non near-zero energy. Then, in block B3, interference is removed with a Savitsky-Golay filter. Signals from blocks A2 and B3 and other continuous physiologic signals 21 are input to the next series of blocks. The other continuous physiologic signals by be tissue impedance, vascular waveform data, tissue oxygenation signals from near infrared spectroscopy and other tissue oxygenation devices. More particularly, in block C1 the prototype distance is calculated with RPD-PD. In block C2, features are extracted with duel-tree complex wavelet decomposition. In block C3, features are extracted in the time domain. The outputs of each of blocks C1, C2 and C3, together with information on the patient's medications 22 and demographics and health history 23 to the classification block 24. Classification is made with set parameters, and a recommendation is output.",
                        "FIG. 3 illustrates the high level steps of the invention. De-identified cardiac arrest data, for a total of 57 subjects from a data bank were included in a study conducted for assessment and validation of the method according to the invention. See block A1 in FIG. 3. Prior to computational analysis, shocks were manually classified as either successful or unsuccessful based on the post-defibrillation ECG segments and data from the pre-hospital care record. Successful defibrillation was defined as a period of greater than 15 seconds with narrow QRS complexes under 150 beats per minute with confirmatory evidence from the medical record or ECG that a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) has occurred. Such evidence included lack of CPR resumption over the next minute, mention of ROSC in record, and/or rapid elevation in PetCO2 levels. While others have utilized alternative definitions that incorporate longer periods of ROSC and specific blood pressures, we chose this definition because a shorter timeframe is more clinically relevant in light of a renewed emphasis on minimizing \u201chands-off\u201d time during the CPR duty cycle as well as the ever evolving treatment paradigms of cardiac arrest (cf. Berg et al. \u201cPart 5: Adult Basic Life support: 2010 AHA guidleines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care\u201d, Circulation 2010; 122; S685-S705). The short pause allows for ROSC determination and rapid return to CPR if defibrillation was unsuccessful. A total of 90 counter shocks were analyzed (56 unsuccessful and 34 successful).",
                        "Where available, ETCO2 data obtained from capnography was also parsed from the subjects' records. See block B1 in FIG. 3. ETCO2 monitoring allows for the measurement of exhaled carbon dioxide from a patient. The level of exhaled carbon dioxide has been positively correlated with the amount of blood flow produced by chest compressions during. ETCO2 values for a total of 48 pre-defibrillation signal-segments were used to extract features that could be valuable in predicting the success of a defibrillation in terminating VF, leading to ROSC.",
                        "The technique proposed in Shandilya et al (cf. S. Shandilya, M. C. Kurz, K. R. Ward, and K. Najarian, \u201cPredicting defibrillation success with a multiple-domain model using machine learning\u201d, IEEE Complex Medical Engineering. 2011, 22-25) was used to process the signals for further analyses. Some signals exhibited high frequency noise, which was attenuated by application of the Savitzky-Golay low-pass (smoothing) filter (cf. A. Savitzky and M. J. E. Golay, \u201cSmoothing and Differentiation of Data by Simplified Least Squares Procedures\u201d, Anal. Chem., July 1964, 36 (8):1627-1639). High-frequency attenuation was achieved by fitting a moving window, of width k data points, to a p\u2266k\u22121 degree polynomial by the least-squares method. For a constant p, k is set to be relatively small when only \u201cslight\u201d smoothing is needed; thereby making the difference between p and k to be relatively small as well. Simple averaging filters were avoided so as to better preserve the high-frequency content.",
                        "Next, sudden baseline jumps and drifts caused by interference were removed, as illustrated in FIG. 4. The signal was successively \u201csmoothed\u201d by repetitive application of Savitzky-Golay filter until only the jumps and drifts remained. The resulting signal was then subtracted from the already \u201clow-passed\u201d signal obtained from the preceding step, yielding the cleaned signal. Frequency-domain dependent filtering methods were precluded due to the presence of all frequencies in a baseline jump and the non-stationary nature of data. Traditional high/low pass filters (such as Butterworth) cannot be employed due to spectral overlap.",
                        "Time-series features from block C3 in FIG. 3 are based on a priori reasoning that ROSC yielding VF waveforms exhibit more activity, having properties of the coarser VF, as described above. An illustration of the Pole Count feature (see FIGS. 5A and 5B) depicts the variations in fibrillation activity of the heart along the lead II axis (sampled at 250 Hz) (cf. S. Shandilya, M. C. Kurz, K. R. Ward, and K. Najarian, \u201cPredicting defibrillation success with a multiple-domain model using machine learning\u201d, IEEE Complex Medical Engineering. 2011, 22-25), and may at least partially represent the extent of homogeneity in VF across classes.",

As such, the predictive model generalizes poorly, or put another way, is not discriminative. Complex wavelet decomposition, under certain conditions, can be approximately shift-invariant without a considerable increase in computational complexity for low-dimensional signals; for our case, one-dimensional.

Neither class presents apparently periodic signals. As such, the novel parameter selection regime, as proposed here, finds a \u201cstructure\u201d in the signal, defined by dimensions m and time delay e. This structure would differ significantly in its pseudo-periodicities for the two classes. Proper parameter selection is essential in rendering this method useful. Four post-defibrillation signals that exhibited regular sustaining sinus rhythms, with narrow complexes, were selected as successful prototypes. Four defibrillations that induced minimal change in the ECG or were immediately followed by smooth VF, with no conversion, were selected as unsuccessful prototypes. Note that selection of pre-defibrillation signals is \u201cblind\u201d in the sense that only post-defibrillation segments are considered during selection.",

As such, feature selection must be performed within the training set that is generated for each run of k-fold cross-validation. However, using the entire training set leads to over-fitting within the training set, which creates a negative bias in accuracies when the test fold is passed through the model Error!

Traditionally, either a subset that performs best for the greatest number of nested/inner runs is chosen (thereby, partially accounting for variance or random effects in the data) or, in case where no single subset is chosen for a majority of the inner runs, a union of all chosen subsets (one for each inner run) presumably yields the best performing feature subset for the outermost test fold. Selection-frequencies for each feature were generated as follows.",

As an alternative to the traditional \u201cwrapper\u201d approach (cf. R. Kohavi and G. John, ibid.), we formulate a new data matrix with features that were found to be members of the best-performing feature-subsets for at least 70% of the runs (see FIG. 7).

In the absence of such features, even cost-sensitive classification yields a decision boundary that is drawn to maximize accuracy only.

RFE is similar to Best First Search (BFS) with a backwards approach. In contrast, by using w, we can reduce n runs to 1 run of the classifier at each step in order to eliminate the feature that leads to the smallest decrease in accuracy.

Bisera. \u201cPrediction of successful defibrillation in human victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective electrocardiographic analysis\u201d, Anaesth Intensive Care 2008; 36: 46-50, propose Amplitude Spectral Area (AMSA) as a useful measure for shock outcome prediction. Two important factors contribute to the uniqueness and to the rigor of our problem. Firstly, we seek to perform a VF to VF pre-shock comparison. Secondly, and more importantly, our definition of a successful shock allows an interventionist to monitor the patient's immediate post-shock condition within a reasonable window of time. Ideally this \u201cmonitoring interval\u201d would be as small as possible to prevent a negative impact on survival (cf. T. D. Valenzuela, D. J. Roe, S. Cretin, D. W. Spaite, and M. P. Larsen, \u201cEstimating effectiveness of cardiac arrest interventions: a logistic regression survival model\u201d, Circulation. 1997; 96: 3308-3313). The supervised dataset has to be based on such a definition. No clear AMSA threshold can be identified (FIG. 8) to distinguish successful shocks from unsuccessful ones. Employing a C4.5 (cf. R Quinlan (1993). C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning. Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Mateo, Calif.) based decision stump or 1-rule for AMSA values yielded 44.1% Sensitivity and 77.2% Specificity. ROC AUC for AMSA was 60.9%. J. N. Watson, P. S. Addison, G. R. Clegg, P. A. Steen, and C. E. Robertson. \u201cPractical issues in the evaluation of methods for the prediction of shock outcome success in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients\u201d, Resuscitation. 2006 January; 68(1):51-9, and J.

However, the definitions of shock success for the two studies, mentioned above, are similar. Accuracy was calculated as the average percentage of instances, over all cross-validation runs, that were correctly classified. All accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values are reported for the best decision threshold found for the given test and algorithm (see Results).",
                        "Our algorithm performs in near real-time to output predictions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC, see FIGS. 9A and 9B) curves are used to evaluate reliability of models by calculating the area under the curve (AUC). Classification using our machine-learning approach with 6-10 features yielded an ROC AUC of 85% and accuracy of 82.2%, for the model built with ECG data only (FIG. 8). Integrating PetCO2 features boosted ROC AUC and Accuracy to 93.8% and 83.3%, respectively, for a total of 48 shocks with usable ETCO2 segments. A large ROC AUC allowed for 90% Sensitivity and 78.6% Specificity at a classifier-output threshold value of 0.22. Classifier (support vector machine: SVM) output for each instance is compared to this value before it is assigned to a class. For classification problems, varying this threshold is a common way to assign more weight to one class than the other. The ROC curves were obtained by varying the threshold values between the two classes.",
                        "In FIG. 2, the system can identify an optimal physiologic condition for resuscitation by recommending a shock. Alternatively, the invented decision support system can be trained on any segment of the ECG signal, pre or post shock. The ML approach can utilize multiple signals, as demonstrated by the use of ETCO2 and also categorical variables, by simply adopting a different logic (such as decision trees) for the Classification (blocks D1 and D2 in FIG. 3). It is important to note that the feature selection and parameter tuning steps (in FIG. 6) performed on the training cardiac arrest database would still remain in-play with linear-SVMs. As such, when the system is trained with post-successful-defibrillation signals, it would be capable of predicting re-arrest for a patient with ROSC.",

Pertsov, \u201cDistribution of excitation frequencies on the epicardial and endocardial surfaces of fibrillating ventricular wall of the sheep heart\u201d, Circ Res., 2000; 86:408-417), defibrillation should occur as soon as possible. Passage of time, in any pulseless rhythm, is the most significant of survival determinants (cf. J. Eilevstjonn, J. Kramer-Johansen, and K. Sunde, \u201cShock outcome is related to prior rhythm and duration of ventricular fibrillation\u201d, Resuscitation, 2007, 75: 60-6 and L. B. Becker, M. P. Ostrander, J. Barrett, and G. T. Kindus, \u201cOutcome of CPR in a large metropolitan area\u2014where are the survivors?\u201d, Ann Emerg Med., 1991; 20: 355-361). Effects of VF duration, which may or may not be countered by CPR, can be a pre-determining factor for defibrillation outcome. As such, any feature quantifying the shift in amplitude and frequency content with increasing VF duration may not discern the effects of CPR on outcome. Results derived from such features (cf. G. Ristagno, A. Gullo, G. Berlot, U. Lucangelo, F. Geheb, and J. Bisera, \u201cPrediction of successful defibrillation in human victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a retrospective electrocardiographic analysis\u201d, Anaesth Intensive Care 2008; 36: 46-50) can positively bias the perception of any algorithmic analysis' utility during intervention, having implications for studies aiming to predict outcomes of defibrillation attempts during/after chest compressions.",

In order to overcome limitations such as the shift variance of traditional DWT, we report a first-use of Complex Wavelet decomposition designed for defibrillation outcome prediction (and for any ECG analysis). Additionally, instead of quantifying the presumably varying degree of aperiodicity across classes through time-delay embedding (cf. M. A. Little, P. E. McSharry, S. J. Roberts, D. A. Costello, and I. M. Moroz, \u201cExploiting Nonlinear recurrence and Fractal scaling properties for voice disorder detection\u201d, Biomedical Engineering Online, vol. 6, 2007), RPD-PD separates distributions of frequency content; thereby distinguishing two signals that differ in more ways than just perceived \u201crandomness\u201d.",
                        "Whenever cross-validation is employed with feature selection or parameter tuning, a twice-nested implementation is requisite for obtaining results that are unbiased by information in the test set. This follows from the assumption that field application will produce previously unseen data, providing a true test for the model. Additionally, there is usually a tradeoff between complexity of the predictive model and its generalization power. As complexity is partly defined by the number of features and values of the machine learning algorithm parameters, nested cross-validation also provides a way to optimize this tradeoff.",

The advantage of the approach described above is that the techniques can be used to incorporate a rich and diverse suite of other real-time physiologic signals such as those providing information about the status of tissue perfusion other than ETCO2 above. These may include but not be limited tissue perfusion status and signals as measured by bioimpediance methods, tissue oxygenation signals obtained by devices such as near-infrared spectroscopy and other devices, vascular waveform data from vessels obtained by piezoelectric sensors and other devices, etc. Categorical data such as patient demographic information, medical history, patient medication, and medications provided during the resuscitation can be incorporated in the machine learning algorithm and approach described above to provide greater accuracy of predictions. The approach may be used in real time to provide the rescuer feedback in regards to therapy that result in interventions, which lead to indications of a successful resuscitation. Finally, the algorithms and approach using these diverse signal and information input can be used after the patient is resuscitated in order to predict rapid decompensation of the patient that may lead to re-arrest. Predicting this decompensation may allow for interventions which prevent re-arrest."
