    "abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a significant role in the daily life of hundreds of millions of people. However, many user profiles in OSNs contain deceptive information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user\u2019s privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting deceptive profiles in OSNs. We specifically define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders and locations in Twitter. First, we collected a large dataset of Twitter profiles and tweets. Next, we defined methods for gender guessing from Twitter profile colors and names. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian classification and K-means clustering algorithms to Twitter profile characteristics (e.g., profile layout colors, first names, user names, and spatiotemporal information) and geolocations to analyze the user behavior. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator through extensive experimentation with our crawled dataset. Based on the outcomes of our approach, we are able to detect deceptive profiles about gender and location with a reasonable accuracy.",

                "Online Social Networks (OSNs) are part of the daily life of hundreds of millions of people. However, many user profiles in OSNs contain misleading, inconsistent, or false information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is widespread, often for protecting a user's privacy. In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for us to be confident about having a healthy and trusted relationships in OSNs. Trust is an important factor in OSNs. However, information posted in OSNs is often not trusted because lying is so widespread. Although privacy issues in OSNs have attracted a considerable attention in recent years, yet currently there is no work on detecting deception in gender and location information posted in OSNs.",
                "The long-term objective of this research is to automatically flag deceptive information in user profiles and posts, based on detecting inconsistencies in those profiles and posts. Here we focus specifically on the detection of inconsistent information involving user gender and the detection of conflicting spatiotemporal information-information about space and timeinvolving user location. In the sequel, we separately discuss our two approaches for detecting deception about gender and location. We collected two distinct Twitter datasets and applied different analysis methods to the two datasets.",

                "Twitter profiles by running a crawler on Twitter's programmable interfaces between January and February 2014. We were specifically interested in the following features for each Twitter user profile: (1) number of colors chosen by Twitter users for their profile, (2) the user name, and (3) the user's first name. We selected profiles containing an external link to a Facebook page specifying the gender of the Twitter user. 2) We applied a number of preprocessing methods to colors and names features of Twitter profiles. Profile preprocessing significantly improved our ability to predict the gender of a Twitter users from the collected features. 3) We independently established the accuracy for each feature (i.e., profile colors, first names, and user names) for predicting the gender of a Twitter user by conducting extensive experimentation with Twitter profiles. 4) We defined a Bayesian classifier seeking to identify Twitter users whose profile characteristics conflict with the self-declared gender information collected from Facebook. We identified several thousands profiles as being potentially deceptive and a smaller subset of profiles as being likely deceptive. 5) We manually checked the profiles and postings of Twitter users that the Bayesian classifier had identified as being potentially deceptive.",
                "The outcome of these studies is that the first name, user name, and background color chosen by a user for his/her profile can provide reasonably accurate predictions of the user's gender. In addition, these characteristics can also help finding deceptive information. We specifically identified 4% of the 174,600 profiles analyzed as potentially deceptive. Manual inspection was inconclusive in an additional 7.8% of profiles, as those profiles were either deleted before we could manually inspect them or associated with multiple Twitter users (e.g., members of a club or an interest group) rather than individual users. We also manually inspected a statistically-significant randomized sample (about 5%) of potentially deceptive profiles that we identified. We found that about 8.7% of these potentially deceptive profiles were indeed likely deceptive. We also found that many potentially deceptive profiles, about 19.6% of the total, had been deleted before we could examine them or belonged to groups of people. In addition, there were 77 profiles of the 174,600 profiles analyzed as likely deceptive. We manually inspected these likely deceptive profiles and found that a large proportion of those profiles (about 42.85%) were indeed deceptive.",
                "Furthermore, we applied the following paradigm for detecting deceptive information about location.",
                "1) We collected a dataset consisting of about 35,000 Twitter profiles by running a crawler on Twitter's programmable interfaces between March and April 2014. We were specifically interested in the following features for each Twitter user profile: (1) temporal information and (2) spatial information. 2) We validated our findings by comparing them with information about travel destinations of Saudi residents posted by the Saudi Tourist Information and Research Centre. 3) We independently established the accuracy for each feature by predicting the location of a Twitter user by conducting extensive experimentation with Twitter profiles. 4) We defined a Bayesian classifier seeking to identify Twitter users whose profile tweets characteristics contain conflicting information. We identified several thousands profiles as being potentially deceptive and as being likely deceptive. 5) We manually checked the profiles and postings of Twitter users that the Bayesian classifier had identified as being potentially deceptive.",
                "To detect deception about user location, we conducted a spatiotemporal analysis of postings (i.e., tweets) containing geotagged information (i.e., latitude and longitude of the client from which a tweet originated). We used publicly available Twitter data of that period to find out where the people spent their vacation for a particular country, Saudi Arabia, and a particular holiday (Spring break, 2014). The outcome of this study is that analysis of spatiotemporal information extracted from tweets can provide reasonably accurate predictions of the users' locations accuracy. We specifically identified 5% of the 35,000 profiles in the dataset as potentially deceptive profiles. We manually inspected potentially deceptive profiles and found that a large proportion of those profiles (about 35.0%) were indeed deceptive. We also manually inspected a statistically-significant sample of the likely deceptive profiles that we identified. We found, in some cases, that about 90.0% of the identified potentially deceptive profiles were indeed likely deceptive. We conclude that our approach can provide reasonably accurate predictions of gender and location featurebased deception.",
                "On the whole, our preliminary results with our datasets are very encouraging. We can identify deceptive information about gender and location with reasonable accuracy. In addition, our methods use a relatively modest number of profile characteristics and spatiotemporal features, resulting in a lowdimensional feature space. We have deliberately excluded any other profile characteristics, such as posted texts (tweets), because our approach combines a good accuracy and language independence with low computational complexity.",
                "Our main contributions are outlined below. 1) We defined a novel framework for detecting deception in user profiles using different profile characteristics with inconsistent information (i.e., conflict indications). Our framework supports multiple approaches for deception detection. 2) We created a large dataset of Twitter users, and we applied our approaches to the dataset in an effort to assess the performance of the approaches. 3) We applied novel preprocessing methods to our datasets to enhance the accuracy of our gender predictions. 4) We found that considering a combination of multiple profile's characteristics from each Twitter profile leads to a reasonable degree of accuracy for detecting the deception about gender and location. 5) We defined methods for identifying Twitter users containing deceptive information about gender and location. 6) Although, we discuss the deception about gender before [1], here in this research, we added one more novel technique about deception which is the location based approach in detecting the deception. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives background information and summary of related work about deception, gender classification, and location classification. In Section 3, we explain the motivation behind the work. In Sections 4 and 5, we extensively describe the deceptive profiles about gender and location and also we report our empirical results. Finally, in Section 6, we give some conclusions and outline future work directions."

Most of these works investigated spamming which is totally different than the field of deception.

Unlike most existing approaches, our approach is different in term of its originality, simplicity, targeted platform (e.g., OSNs) and novelty. Our approach involved detecting deceptive profile with unreasonable and suspicious geo-location activities in OSN profiles."

They proposed a novel classification algorithm called stacked-SVM-based classification. Their approach depends on simple features such as n-grams, stylistic features, and some statistics on a user's profile. Another work on Twitter, by Pennacchiotti and Popescu [11], used a different set of features extracted from profile contents. These features are derived from an in-depth analysis of profile contents, such as content structure features, text content sentiment features, lexical features and explicit links pointing to outside sources. There are various other works as well that have investigated gender classification [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. These works achieved different accuracy results depending on the method used. A general disadvantage with these works is they use text-based characteristics for gender classification, resulting in an explosion in the resulting number of features (in the order of tens of millions of features). In contrast with these methods, our approach uses only a few hundred features, resulting in low computational complexity and a high degree of scalability [18], [19]."

These features are derived from an in-depth analysis of profile contents, such as geo-location, content structure features and explicit links pointing to outside sources. A general advantage is that these works can be implemented in our approach for geo-location classification, but with different goal which is to find inconsistent information that lead to detect deceptive profiles. In contrast with these methods, our approach to detect deceptive profiles first use spatiotemporal classification and then apply statistical methods to find unreasonable geolocation activities resulting in low computational complexity and a high degree of scalability similar to the approach in [1]."

                        "Lying in OSNs is apparently quite widespread. In OSNs, people lie for different reasons by posting information that is not actually true about themselves. For example, children may lie because they want to register for an OSN with age restrictions. Adults may lie because they want to attract others attention. According to one study, as many as 31% of users in OSNs provide false information to be safe online [23]. Also, in another study, only 20% of people surveyed declared to be honest about the information they provide online [24].",

As many as 42% of children under the age of 13 reported that they lie about their age in order to be able to see content with age restrictions [26]. The interested reader is referred elsewhere for additional detail about the different forms of deception [27]. Here, we define deception as providing false information about one's own gender or location, regardless of the reasons for providing such information.",

One reason for this state of affairs is that there are no reliable indicators for detecting deception; it is unclear which indicators will help and which will not help. Deceitful people will sometimes use great efforts to disguise their deceit. Thus, the problem of detecting the deception is important, but extremely challenging and worthy of attention. To our knowledge, there is no previous work on detecting the deception based on finding conflicting information in a user's profile on an OSN. This work, which extends our previous results [1], is part of a long-standing project aimed at enhancing the trust among members of OSNs."

In those reports, we studied three kinds of profile characteristics, namely profile layout colors, names and user names.

We considered only profiles for which we obtained gender information independently of Twitter content (i.e., by following links to other profiles in Facebook). For each profile in the dataset, we collected the seven profile fields listed above. We also stratified the data by randomly sampling 174,600 profiles, of which 87,300 are classified as male and 87,300 are classified as female.

In the first case, one would compare gender characteristics obtained from each user and flag for potential deception profiles with conflicting indications. In the second case, one would flag for potential deception users whose gender indications from different OSNs conflict with each other. In the third case, profiles whose characteristics conflict with the ground truth are flagged for potential deception.",

In the sequel we describe an implementation using a Bayesian classifier and we report on preliminary empirical results with the method. We also started investigating the second approach above; below we report data comparing the accuracy of gender predictions using first names from Twitter vs. Facebook. The first method above requires a broader set of characteristics than we have considered so far, including posted texts and user descriptions, which are language dependent. We are currently investigating those additional characteristics. The second method requires access to other OSNs than Twitters, which is much more difficult to obtain.",
                                "1) Detecting the Deception: Our approach to deception detection is based on our previous results on gender classification based on color features contained in Twitter profiles and on first names and user names contained therein. In brief, we analyzed user profiles with different classifiers in the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME), which uses the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) machine learning package [28], [29].",
                                "Consequently, for profile colors, we obtained our best results when we considered the following five color-based features in combination: (1) profile background color, (2) text color, (3) link color, (4) sidebar fill color, and (5) sidebar border color. We employed two preprocessing stages in order to enhance the accuracy of our gender predictions using profile colors. First, we apply color clustering whereby we reduce the representation of profile colors from the traditional 8-bit RGB representation to a 5-bit RGB representation, by discarding the three least significant bits from each of the red, green and blue values. The traditional 8-bit RGB representation yields a feature set consisting of 2 8 * 3 = 2 24 or about 16 Million colors. A feature set of this size would be mostly unnecessary as most colors are perceptually indistinguishable from neighboring colors with R, G, and B values differing only by few units from the original color. Thus, we chose to cluster colors in such a way that colors with a given cluster are perceptually similar to each other. In this manner we reduce the total size of our color set to 2 5 * 3 = 2 15 or about 32 thousand colors. The advantage is that we obtain a statistically significant number of profile users in each color cluster. The second preprocessing stage is a color sorting technique by which we arrange colors according to their hue. In this manner, we create a sequence in which similar colors are close to one another.",
                                "We compared empirically the performance of gender predictions using raw colors and colors obtained by applying clustering and sorting. In general, the accuracy of our gender predictions improved from 65% to 74% when applying the two preprocessing stages.",
                                "With respect gender predictions using first names and user names we applied a phoneme-based preprocessing stage. In brief, we first transformed names in a variety of alphabets to Latin characters used in the English alphabet by applying the Google Input Tool (GIT) to the first names and user names we had collected. GIT converts the alphabet of different languages than English (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic) to characters in English. Next, we transform English-alphabet names into phoneme sequences. A phoneme is the smallest set of a language's phonology. For example, John can be represented as the 3-phoneme sequence \"JH AA N\", while Mary can be represented as \"M EH R IY\". We use a phoneme set from Carnegie Mellon University that contains exactly 40 phonemes [30]. Each phoneme may carry three different lexical stresses, namely no stress, primary stress and secondary stress. This transformation resulted in a substantial reduction in the feature space of our classifier with evident performance benefits. In general, our accuracy has improved from about 71% to 82.5% because of this preprocessing stage. We are quite encouraged that not only we improved the accuracy of our gender predictions; we also discovered a world-wide trend whereby similar sounding names are associated with the same gender across language, cultural and ethnic barriers. We tried both finer and coarser representations for names and we found that phonemes give us the best prediction accuracy among the options that we considered, along with a dramatic reduction in the size of our feature spaces.",
                                "In particular, we first report the accuracy of gender predictions obtained with the three kinds of profile characteristics that we considered so far for Twitter users, namely first name, user name, and profile colors. Table I shows a summary of overall accuracy results obtained by applying the the NBtree classification algorithm in the KNIME machine learning package to our entire data set. Table entries show the overall percentage of user profiles whose gender was predicted correctly using the characteristics under consideration. In particular, Column 2 reports accuracy results of 82% obtained with first names alone; Column 3 reports accuracy results of 70% obtained with user names alone; Column 4 reports accuracy results of 75% obtained with the combination of five profile colors we studied; and Column 5 reports accuracy results of 85% obtained when applying all characteristics (i.e., first names, user names, and colors) in combination. As explained above, we preprocessed first names and user names using our phoneme-based method [18]. Although accuracy results vary depending on the characteristics being used, the data in Table I show significant improvements over the 50% baseline for all the characteristics, which is quite encouraging.",
                                "We compute the male trending factor m of each user profile in our data set with a Bayesian classifier that uses the following formula.",
                                "In the above formula w f , w u and w c denote the relative weight of the three gender indicators we consider, namely first names, user names and the 5 color characteristics combined. The weight of an indicator is given by the difference between the measured accuracy of that indicator, as a percentage, and the baseline value of 50%. Thus, if first names have an accuracy of 82%, the weight, w f of the first name indicator is 32. Moreover, s f , s u and s c indicate the sensitivity of a user's feature for a given indicator. For instance, the first name \"Mary\" has a high sensitivity, close to 1, for the female trending index, and a low sensitivity, close to 0, for the male trending index. We assign sensitivity values depending on the proportion of female vs. male users who have the given feature. Thus, the female and male sensitivity for a given value complement each other with respect to the unit value. Evidently, the male trending index computed with Equation ( 1) and the female trending index computed by the corresponding formula for f are also complementary with respect to one. The average value of the male trending index over our stratified data set is \u00b5 = 0.5013 with a standard deviation \u03c3 = 0.1887. These are encouraging numbers. The average falls quite close to the middle of the range for m, that is, between 0 and 1 (as a percentage). Also, the standard deviation is sufficiently high in order for m to be a significant factor in distinguishing male from female profiles.",
                                "After computing the male trending index for each profile in our data set, we divide the profiles in the data set into 5 groups depending on the computed male index m. We define profiles with m values falling in the range 0 \u2264 m \u2264 \u00b5 -2\u03c3 as strongly trending female. Profiles whose m value falls in the range \u00b5 -2\u03c3 < m \u2264 \u00b5 -\u03c3 are classified as weakly trending female. Conversely, we classify profiles with m values falling in the range \u00b5 + 2\u03c3 \u2264 m \u2264 1 as strongly trending male. Profiles whose m value falls in the range \u00b5+\u03c3 \u2264 m < \u00b5+2\u03c3 are classified as weakly trending male. The remaining profiles are not deemed trending either way (neutral profiles). Last, we compare user profiles trending male or female with the ground truth collected from Facebook profiles. Profiles of strongly trending users whose computed trend conflicts with the corresponding ground truth are flagged for likely deception. Profiles of weakly trending users whose computed trend conflicts with the corresponding ground truth are flagged for potential deception. Note that our analysis is inconclusive in the case of users whose computed m value differs from average \u00b5 by less than the standard deviation \u03c3. We plan to explore alternative approaches to deception detection within our framework in order to include these users in our analysis."

Our goal is to determine which of the two indicators is a more reliable predictor of gender for the same user when used independently of other characteristics. Recall that some Twitter profiles contain a link to a Facebook page for the same user. In fact, our data set contains only profiles in which this link is present. Thus, we ran the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on our all of our stratified data set, consisting of 174,600 profiles with a 50% male and female breakdown. No characteristics in addition to first names were included in these experiments.",

In particular, we report an accuracy of 87% for Facebook names, and an accuracy of 75% only for Twitter names. This result seems to indicate that the greater degree of structure and formality imposed by a Facebook profile with respect to a Twitter profile has resulted in a higher degree of trustworthiness for the former profiles than the latter profiles. For instance, a Facebook profile includes a gender field, first-name field, last-name field and a nickname field. A Twitter profile has a single field for a user's full name. We speculate that the ability for a user to define a nickname in Facebook may induce users to report their true first names in the first-name field, whereas Twitter users may be tempted to casually report their nicknames in the full name field of their Twitter profiles.",

These profiles cover approximately 10% of all potentially deceptive profiles in our dataset, excluding profiles that were deleted between the time the profiles were collected and the time we evaluated the profiles.

Each evaluator was instructed to follow a sequence of examination steps. First, each evaluator was instructed to examine profile characteristics such as profile colors, user name, and first name. Next, each evaluator was to examine the self-description of the profile's user. Next, each evaluator was to examine profile postings (i.e., tweets), avatar and pictures in reverse chronological order. However, evaluators were not told the self-declared gender collected from Facebook for each of the 400 randomly-chosen profiles. In addition, evaluators were required to work independently of other evaluators, without communicating with each other.",
                                        "Each evaluator could return, for each of the 400 profiles, one of four possible outcomes: (1) Male, meaning that the profile was thought to belong to a male user with a high degree of confidence; (2) Female, meaning that the profile was thought to belong to a female user with a high degree of confidence; (3) Male/Female, meaning that the profile was thought to belong to multiple people of different genders; and (4) Unclear, meaning that the gender of the profile's holder could not be established from the profile's characteristics.",

These profiles had a self-declared female gender in the corresponding Facebook profile. All evaluators identified a number of profiles as being deceptive, although the total number of such profiles varied by each evaluator. For instance, evaluator B identified 36 profiles as being deceptive, with a further 22 profiles belonging to multiple users. At the opposite end, evaluator D identified 15 profiles as deceptive with 42 further profiles being unclear. Clearly, evaluator D followed a more conservative approach to gender verification than evaluator B. On the whole, the five evaluators found that on average 11.3% of the profiles belong to male users. Thus, they were indeed deceptive. Also, about 9.2% of profiles belong to multiple people of different genders, arguably a deceptive condition. In addition, on average 11.9% of profiles were unclear whether belonging to a male or a female user.",

Again, evaluator B identified the highest number of profiles as being deceptive, with 30 such profiles and a further 12 profiles belonging to multiple users. This time, evaluator E identified the lowest number of deceptive profiles with 20 deceptive profiles, 26 multiple-user profiles and 29 undecidable profiles.",
                                        "Overall, the five evaluators found that on average 12.0% of the 200 profiles belonged to female users with a high degree of confidence, meaning that these profiles were indeed deceptive.

We defined different levels of consensus as three, four or five evaluators returning the same outcome on a given profile. As the data in the table shows, in the overwhelming majority of cases (90% of the profiles) at least three evaluators of five evaluators returned the same outcome. Moreover, in 42% of the profiles, our evaluators reached a unanimous agreement.",
                                        "While the number of cases in which consensus was not reached is relatively modest, 40 profiles or 10% of the total, we believe this number is inflated by different interpretations of two of the outcomes by our evaluators. In particular, evaluator C tended to use the outcome male/female when a profile could not conclusively identified with either gender, whereas evaluator D tended to use the \"unclear\" outcome in such cases. (See Table III and Table IV.)",
                                        "In summary, we are satisfied that our evaluators tended to agree quite often. Of course, an exact determination of a user's gender is impossible without access to confidential demographic information. While some individual errors in the identification a user's gender were possibly made during our verification process, we are confident that the gender of profile users was generally identified correctly by our evaluators. We concluded that about 11-12% of potentially deceptive profiles on average are indeed deceptive with a further 11% of profiles belonging to multiple users of different genders."

This can be done by using knowledge from users' activities. People nowadays periodically edit, change, and post their information using geo-tagged tweets. Thus, analysis of the user information and geo-tagged tweets that come with spatiotemporal information can provide trends of behavior leading to the detection of deception. In this work, we provide novel location-based approach that rely on publicly-available information contained in Twitter user profiles and on posted geo-tagged tweets with spatiotemporal information. 1) Why Does Detecting Deception About Location Matter?: Posting tweet with geo-location is now a common part of communication on Twitter. However, in geo-tagged tweets, it is relatively easy to disguise someone's location using services such as Hotspot Shield [31]. Deception about location is sometimes indicative of a broader pattern of deception.

Twitter users may wish to conceal their locations for multiple reasons, such as to protect their privacy or to buttress additional lies about their personal life. While conducting this research we discovered that some Twitter users lied about visiting exotic places to gain popularity among their Twitter readership.

First, the huge amount of tweets generated world-wide prevents us from performing a pairwise comparison of all tweets from every user whose information we crawled. For example, Twitter generates about 500 Million tweets daily. Moreover, Twitter allows us to collect around 2.5% of tweets generated daily (or 13 Million tweets). Also, Twitter allows to collect about 50% of the geo-tagged tweets. In the case of geo-tagged tweets we know the exact coordinates of the Twitter client and the time when the tweet was posted. Therefore, checking all tweets from all users that we crawled would lead to an insurmountable computational complexity. In addition, validation of potentially deceiving and likely deceiving user tweets would be impossible. Second, most Twitter users do not travel most of the time.

                                "In order to detect unusual behaviors by Saudi travelers during the holiday break in March, 2014, we first analyzed the prevailing behavior of those travelers during the period. Our goal was to identify and examine manually behaviors deviating from the norm before deciding our criteria for flagging potentially deceptive profiles.",
                                "We started our analysis with the whole crawled dataset. We specifically considered about 150 Million geo-tagged tweets world-wide. Next, we applied k-means clustering to locations. We experimented with various values of k, the number of clustered locations. We found that k = 30 was a reasonable compromise between the number of clusters and the accuracy needed to support our further analysis steps.",
                                "Next, we considered all tweets from each user in dataset DB. Each user is represented as a graph whose nodes convey location and temporal information (i.e., coordinates and time) of each geo-tagged tweet from that user while the edges capture the chronological movement of the user. We then mapped the nodes of each graph (corresponding to the movements of each user in DB) to the nearest cluster points.",
                                "We observed chronological movement patterns from the aggregated graphs (i.e., chronological movements originated from each country in the region of interest). We further simplified the graphs by choosing one location from many locations in the same country visited by a Saudi holiday traveler. We show the visualization for travel originating in Saudi Arabia in Figure 2. Evidently, most Saudis traveling abroad during the holiday break visited exactly one country. For this reason, we decided to flag travelers visiting two or more countries as potentially deceptive. We counted the undefined country as well as identified countries when applying this criterion. We also flagged as potentially deceptive travelers to countries where travel is discouraged, such as countries in a state of war, since travel to such countries is highly unlikely. Moreover, we decided to flag travelers visiting three or more countries (including the undefined country) as likely deceptive. The remainder of our analysis is based on these two definitions.",
                                "We manually examined all potentially deceptive and likely deceptive profiles in order to determine whether the tweets from those profiles appeared consistent with real travel to the locations of the tweets. We used this analysis to determine whether a user profile was either truly deceptive or not. For all these users, we had to crawl additional data within the limitations allowed by Twitter in order to make an accurate determination. We used various kinds of information to make the determination. For example, we used inconsistent spatiotemporal information, such as tweets from disparate locations within a short period of time, to determine that a user's profile was deceptive. We plan to feed our findings about deception into our classifier to train the classifier for future analysis of this kind. Our long term goal is to avoid manual examination of user profiles altogether by building a fully-automated, ground-truth-based classifier system."

                                "1) Traveling to multiple foreign countries: Following the approach above, we checked profiles of users visiting multiple countries, including the undefined country, during Spring break. We found that there are 2466 user profiles from dataset DB that meet this condition. This was computed by comparing the number of unique users, which is 35,788, to the number of the total visits made by those unique users as shown in Table VII. It shows the user profiles who visited either one country or more than one country during the spring break. We ignore any additional visits made inside the border of destination (e.g., if the user visits two or more locations within the same country, those explored visits are not counted, but, considered as one visit). For the purpose of this analysis we divide the 35,788 identified user profiles into three disjoint sets. Therefore, in this subsection, we discuss potentially deceptive users as well as likely deceptive users based on vacation activities.",
                                "From Table VII, we have 1,656 users out of 35,788 unique users having visited more than one country during the holiday break. Also, there are 4,142 visited countries made by these 1,656 users. Thus, in some cases, those users showed conflicting and impossible geo-location activities.",
                                "Furthermore, Table VIII shows that there are around 1,656 users identified to be as either potentially or likely deceptive.   One Na\u00efve way to compute a statistical representation of deceptive profile is to compute speed and time as Euclidean distance:",
                                "Given this computed path speed if it is conflicting as compare to normal speed , then, it is a potential deceptive profile about location. Indeed, we verified the profiles that we identified and reported them in Table VIII.",
                                "2) Traveling to discouraged countries: For the purpose of this analysis we divide the 35,788 identified user profiles into two disjoint sets. Therefore, in this subsection, we discuss potentially deceptive users based on their visits to discouraged countries. We checked profiles of users visiting discouraged countries during Spring break. We follow a simple and greedy statistical method that uses DB.",
                                "First, we identified a list of discouraged countries, such as countries in a state of war. It is highly unlikely that someone will go for a vacation in such a country. We then flagged any profiles that spent the holiday break in such countries. The list of the discouraged countries are different from a country to another. For our study, we selected the 10-top discouraged countries provided by the government of Canada to their citizen since the government of Saudi Arabia does not provide any list of discouraged countries. We detailed this list of discouraged countries in the discussion subsection.",
                                "Assume that DC is the list of discouraged countries. This list should be subset of the country list that extracted from dataset DB. Therefore, any profile from the dataset DB to countries that meets this condition, is flagged as potentially deceptive. We identified 62 visits that are subset of DC discourage-countries . Also, from the 62 visits, we identified 32 unique users. Thus, those 32 users are flagged as potentially deceptive. We manually further inspected those users and identified 29 users, about 90.0%, as likely deceptive. In fact, All 29 users are indeed identified earlier in the subsection of traveling to multiple foreign countries (i.e., 29 users match the list of likely deceptive profiles that we identified in the previous subsection). Table IX shows the accuracy results in detecting deception by using the top-10 discouraged countries. In conclusion, we are only including the top-10 discouraged countries. However, if we have including more discouraged countries or the least visited countries to this approach, we may identify more profiles to be as potential deceptive."

We also validated our findings by manually inspecting potentially and likely deceptive profiles. Also, we include some challenges faced during this investigation.",
                                "1) Validation by comparing with official Data: We confirmed travel destinations of users in Saudi Arabia based on a study conducted by the Saudi Tourist Information and Research Centre [32]. This study was published by the SABQ Online Newspaper [33]. According to the study, the top 10 destinations for about 6 Million Saudis are: United States of America, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Gulf Cooperation Council Countries excluding Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Philippines, Turkey, Morocco, Australia and Switzerland. Similarly, our dataset shows our findings match the study by the Saudi Tourist Information and Research Centre. Our findings show that the top 10 destinations are: Gulf Cooperation Council Countries excluding Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Turkey, United States of America, Egypt, Jordan, Malaysia, France and Spain. It also shows more than expected visits to such countries as Brazil, Germany and India. This validation leads us to have a better understanding about where the Saudis are spending their vacations as normally expected according to the government data. Therefore, any conflicting or unexpected destination locations information to the Saudis must be checked for further investigation.",
                                "According to the government of Canada [34], there are 12 discouraged destinations. The citizens of Canada are warned not to visit the following countries: Niger, Chad, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Central Africa Republic, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. Our experiments have shown that there are 62 unique Saudis who visited these countries.",
                                "2) Validation of the user profiles who made more than 50 visits: Here, we validate our dataset by randomly selected any profile who meets the following condition. The condition is to select any profile in our dataset DB who visits more than 50 locations during the holiday break. Given the fact about where the Saudis spent their vacations, we have identified around 880 unique users, about 2.4% of the population, who visited more than 50 locations (i.e., more than 50 checked-in) during the holiday. In this case, we counted all the visits the user made-inside and outside-the countries that the user explored. In fact, we crawled those 880 users again to get more tweets information, and found that they generated more than 1.3 Million tweets in which around 1.1 Million tweets contain geo-location information and the others come without geo-location information. As a result, we further investigated those profiles by applying our manual approach to check whether those geo-tagged tweets are inconsistent with the spatiotemporal information. We found, yet, that 523 out of the 880, about 59.4%, users are likely deceptive profiles and we report that in Table VIII.",
                                "Moreover, in another way in selecting random profiles to be investigated manually, we have listed all the countries that were visited by Saudis in ascending order of their visits. We have around 215 unique points (i.e., countries). Also, there are around 34 countries have been visited by at least 10 unique Saudis. In contradiction, there are 1482 Saudis who visited the undefined country. In addition, there are around 180 countries have been visited by at most 9 unique Saudis. From the bottom of the list, we randomly selected 200 profiles with visits to discouraged countries to be manually inspected for deception. We found 34 profiles, about 17%, are likely deceptive after manually inspected them. Through this investigation, we also randomly selected one profile out of the 34 likely deceptive users to deeply manually inspected. The chosen profile visited a discouraged country in which located in Africa. This kind of visit is considered as unusual, and, to be as potentially deceptive at the one hand. On the other hand, we manually further inspected this profile. therefore, we found that the profile generates random geo-tagged tweets that come with random geo-location and random posting text in every 5 minutes.",
                                "3) Challenges: We experienced many challenges during dataset collection and validation. One of the major challenge was that some of geo-tagged tweets do not have accurate or complete geo-location information which make it a bit difficult decision for the weighted spatiotemporal features indication. Thus, the spatiotemporal features indications must be interchanged dynamically based on the available information.",
                                "Another challenge is that some of the profile's settings are edited periodically by the owners. For example, we collected enough geo-tagged tweets information for a profile at one point of time, but, on the other time, we have different geo-tagged tweets information that belong to the same profile. Currently we just excluded those types of profiles."

                        "Our ultimate goal is to find inconsistent information in online social networks about user gender and location in order to detect deception. In particular, we defined a set of analysis methods for that purpose on Twitter. Also, we apply Bayesian classification and K-means clustering algorithms to Twitter profile characteristics (e.g., profile layout colors, first names, user names, and spatiotemporal information) to analyze user behavior. Therefore, in this study, we presented frameworks for detecting deception about gender and location information. In addition, we reported preliminary empirical results with a strategy for attaining this goal within the framework. Through extensive experiments, our current results show considerable promise for our framework. Based on the outcomes of our approach, we are able to detect deceptive profiles with an accuracy of around 90.0% in some cases. Our empirical experiments obtained by applying our algorithms to multiple datasets showed promising results.",
                        "In the future, we will continue exploring alternative strategies in an effort to improve the accuracy of our predictions. Although, our two approaches in detecting the deception, namely detecting the deception about gender and location, are independent and different in term of their depth, properties, structures and novelties, yet, the synthesis of the two approaches are going to be implemented and going to provide a powerful tool in detecting the deceptive profiles. We will also consider additional features, such as the genders of Twitter friends and followers, as part of gender predictions as well as more features in the location. We will also explore text-based features factors for both approaches, such as user postings, and we will include these features if their advantages outweigh their cost in terms of language dependence and increased computational complexity. Finally, we plan to explore more novel approaches in detecting the deception such as age and other factors that are supported by our main framework."
