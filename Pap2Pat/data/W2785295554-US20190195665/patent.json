                                "In recent years, structural health monitoring (SHM) is becoming critical in structural engineering and geotechnical engineering applications. Distributed fiber optic sensors technology, as an effective method of SHM, has the advantages of long sensing distance, distributed sensing information and small sensor size. Rayleigh and Brillouin based distributed fiber optic sensors therefore have been developed to monitor distributed temperature and strain information for decades. With the development of smart infrastructure, distributed dynamic measurement of strain can be used in many applications, such as detection of seismic activity, perimeter security and intrusion sensing, traffic monitoring, railway monitoring and bridge monitoring.",
                                "Phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (phase-OTDR), the most studied Rayleigh based dynamic system, has been proved to be capable of detecting strain vibration as accurate as 0.08 \u03bc\u03b5, but it can only give the relative strain between two strain conditions. In addition, phase-OTDR has a limited strain range of as low as 2 \u03bc\u03b5, and its linearity between phase and strain is sensitive to the intrinsic phase of the fiber.",
                                "Brillouin based dynamic systems can measure the absolute strain with a large strain range higher than ten thousand \u03bc\u03b5. Brillouin based systems demonstrate a slow sampling rate (tens of Hz to a few hundred Hz) and a limited sensing distance from tens of meters to a few hundred meters.",
                                "Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) has the advantage of single-end access compared with Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) so that BOTDR can work even if the optic fiber cable is broken halfway. At the construction site, this advantage brings huge benefits for sensor deployment and testing. However, BOTDR usually needs a large number of averaging due to the weak power of spontaneous Brillouin scattering (SpBS) and the conventional frequency scanning method. Recently, Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) algorithm takes the place of frequency scanning in BOTDR, reduces the averaging times and realizes the dynamic strain measurement, whose performance is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is usually low in BOTDR.",
                                "Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is usually avoided in BOTDR, which weakens the injected power along long fiber under test (FUT) (tens of km) and shortens the sensing distance. For many civil engineering applications, however, the sensing distance requirement is reduced to 1 km, e.g. the monitoring of piles and buildings, greatly shorter than the achievable sensing distance of BOTDR."

This MI effect will lead to spectral sidebands symmetrically on both sides of the frequency of the input pulse which rises with the input power. At the wavelength of 1550 nm, anomalous dispersion is observed on single-mode communication optic fibers.",

By setting the interaction length of SBS to be 4 m for 40 ns pulse duration, conventional SBS thresholds, MI thresholds and FRS thresholds for different fiber lengths are illustrated in FIG. 1. It can be seen that the MI threshold is smaller than the conventional SBS threshold and that the FRS threshold is larger than MI threshold. In fact, by substituting the parameters with numerical values in Eq. 1 and Eq. 6 and using SI units, it can be derived that Pth-R=1.28\u00d7104/Leff, Pth-MI=3.09\u00d7103/Leff, Pth-B=67.2/L , and hence Pth-R=4.14Pth-MI\u00b7Pth-R is always larger than Pth-MI\u00b7Pth-MI is only larger than Pth-B when Leff/L<46 . For interaction length L of 4 m, Pth-B becomes the dominant threshold when Leff<184 m. However, under this condition, Pth-B16.8 W , which is a high power for normal optic fiber and thermal effects might cause damage on the fiber. This proves that MI threshold determines the maximum input power threshold for BOTDR. The small gain SBS is happening below MI threshold.",

The PD output signal is downconverted by a 10.5 GHz local oscillator 46, and electronically amplified (via amplifiers 48) and filtered via band-pass filter (BPF) 50 to produce output signal 54.

So the shot noise and the RIN noise (the second and the third terms of the denominator) can be seen to be related with POLO only. The thermal noise (the first term of the denominator), the shot noise and the RIN noise are therefore independent of PB . Furthermore, for this BOTDR system 10, a total calculated electronic noise figure (NF) of 2.11 dB is added onto the system, which is hardly influenced by the Brillouin power as well. The noise by the EDFA 22 seen on the PD 44 is much smaller than the shot noise and thermal noise and hence can be neglected. The SNR, therefore, is to be mainly influenced by the numerator. With the same setup, the increase of PB will enhance the numerator of Eq. 8 and the SNR.",

The output signal 52 was captured by a digitizer 54 for 50ms at each measurement, and processed with the averaging number of 25 to derive each profile of BFS 70, leading to a 2.5 kHz sampling rate for vibration detection. According to Nyquist principle, a vibration of up to 1.25 kHz can be detected. By setting a faster pulse repetition frequency, the vibration sampling rate can be faster and reach up to 4 kHz for 1 km fiber under the same condition (100 kHz pulse repetition for 10 \u03bcs period). The spatial sampling resolution was set to 0.4 m by setting up the STFT, which means that there is a BFS result along the fiber at every 0.4 m.",
                        "The measured strain vibration over 50 ms is shown in FIG. 4, which was obtained by averaging of the derived BFS over fiber section S2 34. At 3.12 W input peak pulse power, a clear sine waveform can be seen. The measured peak-to-peak change of BFS is about 16 MHz, corresponding to 320 \u03bc\u03b5 strain change on the fiber. At 1.2 W peak pulse power, the shape of the derived waveform is much more distorted. Via sine fitting, the R-squared values (the parameter describing how close the fitted results are to the data) of 0.75, 0.59 and 0.37 are derived for the peak pulse power of 3.12 W, 2.38 W and 1.2 W, respectively.",
                        "Spectra of the measured strain vibration profiles in FIG. 4 were demonstrated in FIG. 5. A frequency component at 60 Hz can be seen in FIG. 5 for each input power level. Furthermore, the noise level at 1.2 W is the highest among the three spectra while the spectra at 3.12 W gives the best noise level. The experimental result at 3.12 W with SBS effect gives a better detection of strain vibration at 2.5 kHz vibration sampling rate.",
                        "The corresponding BFS profiles 70 obtained after signal processing are illustrated in FIG. 6. From the position of 850 m to 910 m, the BFS drops for about 40 MHz due to the change of condition of the fiber. The fluctuation of the measured BFS at the peak pulse power of 1.2 W is much larger than that at 3.12 W. The corresponding frequency uncertainty for each input power level is calculated as the standard deviation of the measured BFS over time. The uncertainties are 5.1 MHz, 6.3 MHz, and 10.7 MHz at 3.12 W, 2.38 W and 1.2 W input peak pulse power, respectively.",
                        "The vibration of strain is added onto fiber section S2 34 with about 150 MHz (about 3000 pc) pre-strain. The BFS profiles of S2 are enlarged in FIG. 7A. The differences of BFS amplitudes between different input levels are caused by the strain vibration. In FIG. 7A, the rising edge of BFS for input peak pulse power of 3.12 W is from the position of 922 m to the position of 922.4 m. The rising edge of detected BFS profile for 2.38 W peak pulse power is one sampling point (0.4 m) later than that for 3.12 W. The rising edge for 1.2 W peak pulse power is even delayed more. This is the distance error in time domain due to the double-peak effect of the BFS spectra in frequency domain with large BFS change. With a worse SNR in the case of 1.2 W input, compared with that for the other two profiles, the distance error is more obvious due to the amplitude error by small SNR and the double-peak effect.",

                        "7A is given in FIG. 7B. The points in the rectangular box are the detected Brillouin power of the sampling points on the rising edges of the BFS profiles in FIG. 7A. At 3.12W and 2.38 W peak pulse power, a local minimum point can be found respectively in the rectangle in FIG. 7B. At this transition point, the double peak effect splits the detected Brillouin power at one sampling point of the FUT 30 onto two BFS and hence the detected power of a single BFS drops. The spectra of the sampling points on the rising edges in FIG. 7A are drawn in FIG. 7C. It can be seen in FIG. 7C that the larger the peak pulse power, the better the SNR. The distance error effect can be smaller accordingly. The static performance of the BOTDR 10 was measured with the shaker off.",
                        "With the same settings, the power traces of measured BFS along FUT 30 at different input power levels were obtained with 25 times of averaging and illustrated in FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B. At the input levels below 3.51 W, the power attenuation is very small and can be negligible at 1.2 W. At 3.51 W peak pulse power, the power depletion caused by MI can be clearly observed and cuts down the SNR at the far end of FUT 30. This power level can be seen as the MI threshold for this fiber length. FIG. 8B shows the measured optical spectra at the far end of FUT 30 at the peak pulse power of 2 W, 3.12 W and 3.52 W respectively. At 2 W peak pulse power, no MI is shown on the spectrum. At 3.12 W, a small MI can be seen located on both sides of the signal frequency. This MI spectrum grows significantly when peak pulse power increases to 3.52 W. By integration of the MI spectrum, the MI power is 10 dB lower than the signal power at 3.12 W peak pulse power, whereas the integrated MI power equals to the signal power at 3.52 W peak pulse power, which reaches the MI threshold.",
                        "The measured Brillouin Stokes and anti-Stokes power, and the calculated SpBS power and SBS power by Eq. 9 and Eq. 11 are shown in FIG. 9. The measured Stokes power increases much faster than the anti-Stokes power and shows an exponential growth as the input peak pulse power rises. The measured Stokes power matches with the calculated SBS power. The measured anti-Stokes power shows a good fit with the calculated SpBS power. The anti-Stokes SBS propagates in positive direction along the fiber and attenuates exponentially. Hence the measured anti-Stokes can be seen as the SpBS. At around 1.1 W, the SBS and SpBS have the same power and SBS becomes dominant as the input peak pulse power continues rising. 1.2 W is used as the threshold of small gain SBS in this experiment, as demonstrated in FIG. 4. Apparently, even at the input peak pulse power of 4.19 W, the SBS power is still below the conventional SBS threshold which is mostly defined to be 100% or 1% of input power. But small gain SBS can be clearly seen under this condition from FIG. 9.",
                        "In conclusion, the input peak pulse power thresholds at short sensing distance were calculated. At sensing distance within 1 km, peak pulse power can be raised up compared with long sensing distance. Small gain SBS is used in BOTDR system 10 to enhance the SNR and to realize fast dynamic strain detection. A small gain SBS based BOTDR system of distributed dynamic strain vibration measurement has been established with the ability to measure as high as 1.25 kHz vibration. A vibration of 60 Hz on a fiber section of 5.6 meters has been successfully detected.",
