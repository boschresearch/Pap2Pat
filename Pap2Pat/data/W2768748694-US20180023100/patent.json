Paired-end reads were generated, with an average read length of 150 bp and paired distance of 500 bp. Raw data was analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench, version 7.5 (Qiagen, USA). First reads were mapped to the reference genome (NC_017992). Mapping was improved by 2 rounds of local realignment. The CLC Probabilistic Variant Detection algorithm was used to determine small mutations (single and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms, short insertions and short deletions). Variants occurring in less than 90% of the reads and variants that were identical to those of the wild type strain (i.e. due to errors in the reference sequence) were filtered out. To determine larger mutations, the CLC InDel and Structural Variant algorithm was run. This tool analyzes unaligned ends of reads and annotates regions where a structural variation may have occurred, which are called breakpoints. Since the read length averaged 150 bp and the minimum mapping fraction was 0.5, a breakpoint can have up to 75 bp of sequence data. The resulting breakpoints were filtered to eliminate those with fewer than 10 reads or less than 20% \u201cnot perfectly matched.\u201d The breakpoint sequence was searched with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm for similarity to known sequences.
