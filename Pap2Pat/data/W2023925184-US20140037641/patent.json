                        "The polymorphic fungus Candida albicans is a commensal organism that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, vagina and some cutaneous areas of the majority of healthy humans. However, under certain conditions the fungus is able to cause a variety of infections, ranging from mucosal to life-threatening invasive candidiasis (18). C. albicans continues to be the most common cause of various forms of candidaisis (34, 47), but several other Candida spp. are also important agents. Invasive disease is associated with billions of dollars each year in healthcare costs and a mortality rate estimated at \u02dc40% (32, 33). The limited number and toxicity of antifungal agents, and, most importantly, the poor outcome of almost half of the number of candidemia patients treated with appropriate antifungal therapy, militates in favor of disease prevention, possibly through active and passive immunization strategies (10, 15, 41).",
                        "The protective role of antibodies against Candida has been controversial, but the evidence is mounting in favor for this mode of protection. Specificity of protective antibodies may be for C. albicans cell wall polysaccharides, proteins and peptides (13, 17, 40, 53, 55). As a prevention strategy, protection against disease may be actively or passively acquired by vaccination and transfer of preformed monoclonal antibodies, respectively. As a therapeutic measure, experimental evidence indicates that preformed antibodies may enhance the effectiveness of antifungal agents (24, 43).",
                        "The first fully synthetic glycopeptide vaccines against C. albicans induced protection against disseminated candidiasis in mice (53). Six putative T-cell peptides found in C. albicans cell wall proteins were conjugated to the protective \u03b2-1,2-mannotriose [\u03b2-(Man)3] glycan epitope to create glycopeptide conjugates. The six proteins from which the peptides, denoted in parentheses, were derived because of expression during human candidiasis and cell wall association and included: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba) (YGKDVKDLDYAQE; SEQ ID NO:1); methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate homocysteine methyltransferase (Met6) (PRIGGQRELKKITE; SEQ ID NO:2); hyphal wall protein-1 (Hwp1) (QGETEEALIQKRSY; SEQ ID NO:3); enolase (Enol) (DSRGNPTVEVDFTT; SEQ ID NO:4); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gap1) (NRSPSTGEQKSSGI; SEQ ID NO:5); and phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1) (VPLDGKTITNNQRI; SEQ ID NO:6) (53). The intent of this work was that the peptides would serve as T-cell epitopes, promoting protective antibody responses against the glycan part of the glycopeptide conjugates. Thus, the immunization protocols were designed to favor antibody, rather than cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses and antibodies were generated against both the glycan and peptide parts of the various conjugates. That is, by DC based immunization protocols favoring antibody production, the three glycoconjugates \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba, \u03b2-(Man)3-Meth and \u03b2-(Man)3-Hwp1 induced protection from hematogenous challenge with the fungus as evidenced by mouse survival and low kidney fungal burden (53). The \u03b2-(Man)3-Enol and \u03b2-(Man)3-Gap1 gave moderate protection, and the \u03b2-(Man)3-Pgk1 slightly enhanced disease. For the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate, protection was uniquely acquired through immunity against the glycan and the Fba peptide. The native protein fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1p), which catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, has become an attractive antifungal target for several reasons. First, this key enzyme is required for growth on both fermentative and nonfermentative carbon sources; therefore it is essential for C. albicans viability and other pathogenic fungi (48). Second, fungal fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases are distinct from human fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases. C. albicans Fba1p belongs to the family of class II aldolases found predominantly in fungi and prokaryotes (39). In contrast, the human enzyme belongs to the class I aldolases, and the sequence of human aldolase is significantly different from those of fungal aldolases (39), thus it is reasonable to expect that it may be possible to achieve an immunologic response specific only to the fungal enzyme. Indeed, the Fba 14 mer peptide sequence (YGKDVKDLFDYAQE; SEQ ID NO:1) is unique to C. albicans (53).",

                        "We have designed several new peptides based on Candida cell wall proteins that show efficacy as a vaccine development against candidiasis, and potentially other fungal diseases for some of the peptides. The protective capacity of these peptide vaccines, whether either formulated with a human-approved adjuvant or by a DC-based immunization approach that favors production of protective antibody, was assessed in a murine model of human disseminated candidiasis. The vaccine conferred protection. In addition, using the Fba peptide (SEQ ID NO:1), we have shown that vaccine protection was associated with production of anti-Fba peptide antibodies in the sera of immunized mice. Importantly, the Fba peptide may be expected to be immunogenic in humans. A monoclonal antibody (MAb E2-9) specific for the Fba peptide was isolated from splenocytes of Fba-immunized mice and was shown to be protective against candidiasis in passive transfer experiments. This monoclonal antibody can be used for short-term protection against candidiasis. We have also designed peptide vaccines based on Fba or Met6 (Fba3 (SEQ ID NO:8); Fba4 (SEQ ID NO:9; and Met6-2 (SEQ ID NO:10) that would be more general fungal vaccines, and have shown that these peptides have efficacy as vaccines. In addition, we modified the Fba sequence by methylating amino acids at different positions (SEQ ID NOS:11-19) or by adding two cysteine residues (SEQ ID NO:20). These modified Fba indicated a degree of effectiveness as vaccines.",
                        "In addition, we developed a new vaccine conjugate by modifying the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate by coupling it to tetanus toxoid (TT) to improve immunogenicity and allow for use of an adjuvant suitable for human use. The modified \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT was administered either alone or as a mixture made with alum or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants and given to mice by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Mice vaccinated with or surprisingly, without adjuvant responded well by making robust antibody responses. The immunized groups showed a high degree of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans as evidenced by increased survival times and reduced kidney fungal burden as compared to control groups that received only adjuvant or DPBS buffer prior to challenge. To confirm that induced antibodies were protective, sera from mice immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate transferred protection against disseminated candidiasis to na\u00efve mice, whereas C. albicans-absorbed immune sera did not. Similar antibody responses and protection induced by the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT vaccine was observed in inbred BALB/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. The addition of TT to the glycopeptide conjugate resulted in a new self-adjuvanting vaccine that promotes robust antibody responses without the need for additional adjuvant, which is a major benefit to a vaccine design against disseminated candidiasis."

                        "Previously we showed antibodies specific for the glycan \u03b2-1,2-mannotriose [\u03b2-(Man)3] on the cell surface of Candida albicans protect mice against disseminated candidiasis. Furthermore, six 14 mer peptides that are within the N-terminal portion of C. albicans wall proteins were conjugated to the glycan in an attempt to create immunogenic glycopeptide conjugates. By a dendritic cell (DC)-based immunization approach, all were immunogenic and three of the six conjugates induced a high degree of protection in mice. Interestingly, whereas all six peptides induced antibody responses when used alone to pulse DCs for subsequent immunizations, three peptides induced protection and one in particular, peptide Fba (derived from fructose-bisphosphate aldolase), induced robust protective responses and was the focus of the current work. We have now shown as described below that the Fba peptide is not MHC II-restricted as it induced anti-Fba antibodies in mice of different H-2 haplotypes and in rabbits. Furthermore, the peptide induced protection against disease caused by different C. albicans strains. Partial protection was achieved when alum was used in place of DCs for Fba immunizations. Passive transfer of immune sera from Fba vaccinated mice, but not immune serum preabsorbed with fungal cells, conferred protection in na\u00efve mice. We also show that a monoclonal antibody specific for the Fba peptide, E2-9 (IgM), protected mice against candidiasis, and could provide short term protection from candidiasis infection. This monoclonal antibody, or monoclonal antibodies isolated from the other new peptides, could be used with other antifungal compounds to protect against a Candida infection.",
                        "We have also designed vaccines for use against additional fungal diseases based on Fba and Met6, and have named these peptides Fba2 (SEQ ID NO:7), Fba3 (SEQ ID NO:8), Fba4 (SEQ ID NO:9), and Met6-2 (SEQ ID NO:10). These all had some efficiency as vaccines, although Fba2 was somewhat less efficacious. We then modified the sequence of Fba by methylating amino acids at various positions (SEQ ID NOS:11-19) or by adding two cysteine residues (SEQ ID NO:20), as shown in Table 1 below. These modified Fba peptides also showed effectiveness as vaccines. These peptides can also be administered with a protein carrier, e.g., tetanus toxoid, or with adjuvants to increase the effectiveness as vaccines. Several peptide vaccines, including peptides from Streptococcus and Cholera, have been covalently linked to tetanus toxin (63, 64, 65) or to tetanus TH epitopes (e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0101534).",
                        "We have also modified the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate previously reported (53) by coupling it to tetanus toxoid (TT) in order to improve immunogenicity and allow for use of an adjuvant suitable for human use. By new immunization procedures entirely compatible with human use, the modified \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT was administered either alone or as a mixture made with alum or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants and given to mice by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Mice vaccinated with or, surprisingly, without adjuvant responded well by making robust antibody responses.

Similar antibody responses and protection induced by the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT vaccine was observed in inbred BALB/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. The addition of TT to the glycopeptide conjugate resulted in a self-adjuvanting vaccine that promotes robust antibody responses without the need for additional adjuvant, which is novel and represents a major step forward in vaccine design against disseminated candidiasis. We believe that conjugates based on the addition of \u03b2-(Man)3 and TT to the other peptides discussed above will make self-adjuvanting vaccines that will promote antibody responses and protection against fungal infections or diseases.",

We selected six candidate carriers, each of which was comprised of 14 amino acids located near the N-terminus of their respective complete protein presumed to be located in the cell wall of the fungus (46, 53). The six candidate carrier peptides, in parentheses, were derived from the proteins fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba); methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate (Met6); hyphal wall protein-1 (Hwp1); enolase (Enol); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gap1); and phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1). Each synthetic peptide was chemically conjugated to the synthetic glycan \u03b2-(Man)3 to produce the six glycopeptides vaccine constructs for immunogenic testing. Three of the glycopeptide conjugates, \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba, \u03b2-(Man)3-Met6 and \u03b2-(Man)3-Hwp1, induced a high degree of protection as evidenced by survival and low kidney fungal burden following challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans (53). These prior results led us to consider whether protection was also contributed by responses to the carrier peptides.

This conclusion was further strengthened by an extended observation in which neither of two other peptides Gap1, or Eno1 induced protection against disseminated candidiasis (FIG. 1B). Importantly, the survivors in groups immunized against Fba, Met6 and Hwp1 had low or even non-detectable viable fungal units (colony forming units, CFUs) in kidneys (FIG. 1C)\u2014a target organ in disseminated candidiasis, as compared to animals that succumbed (p<0.001). Mice immunized with Gap1 or Enol1 alone resulted in a slightly less fungal burden in the kidneys as compared to non-immune mice, but the differences were not significant.

Serum was collected from mice immunized by the dendritic cell approach against Fba peptide 14 days post-immunization. Immune sera were pooled and tested for passive protection of naive mice against experimental disseminated candidiasis as described in Example 1 above. FIG. 5A shows survival curves and indicates that enhanced protection against disseminated C. albicans infection was observed in mice that received serum from mice immunized with the Fba peptide as compared to animals that received control materials. Note that the donor mice used as positive controls for protection had similar survival curve as the na\u00efve mice that received the immune serum. Importantly, absorption with C. albicans before transfer also removed the protective value of immune serum. FIG. 5B indicates that the immunized mice and mice that received antiserum had significantly fewer (P<0.0001) fungal counts or non-detectable CFUs in kidneys as compared to the control groups that received DPBS buffer or the same sera that had been preadsorbed with C. albicans yeast cells. FIG. 5C shows that rabbit immune sera containing specific anti-Fba polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) also provided some protection to mice against disseminated candidiasis.

As a negative control, after the splenocyte absorption, rabbit anti-Fba immune serum was absorbed again, but this time with live C. albicans yeast cells to remove Fba-specific antibodies. Anti-Fba antibody titers were tested by ELISA before and after adsorption with the fungal cells. The Fba antibodies were no longer detectable following the adsorption (data not shown). The mice treated with rabbit antiserum had 40% survival at the end of the experiment and overall prolonged survival times as compared to the control groups (FIG. 5C), which again supports a protective role for anti-Fba antibodies against candidiasis. The reason for the relatively weak protection by rabbit immune sera, as compared to mouse anti-Fba sera, is not known but may well be due to lower efficiency of FcR effector function of rabbit antibodies within the mouse system (1).",

Each point is the mean of three determinations, and the data shown are from a typical experiment of four independent experiments, all producing similar results. The concentration of inhibitor (Fba peptide) required to achieve 50% inhibitory concentration was about 10 \u03bcg/ml.

Compared to MAb B6.1, which is specific for the C. albicans cell surface epitope \u03b2-trimannose, the reactivity of MAb E2-9 with live C. albicans cells was relatively slight. In FIG. 8C, an important additional negative control tested whether the binding of MAbs E2-9 and B6.1 occurs on live Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which should not express either Fba or the \u03b2-trimannose epitope.

Development of monoclonal antibodies specific for Fba peptide provides the possibility of producing an unlimited supply of protective antibody for in vivo applications. MAb E2-9 was selected for study and was tested as described above in passive transfer experiments showing protection by polyclonal antiserum. The results are shown in FIGS. 9A-9B.",
                                "FIGS. 9A and 9B indicated that anti-Fba IgM MAb (E2-9) protected mice against disseminated candidiasis. To confirm that MAb E2-9 produced by cell culture was able to protect mice against experimental disseminated candidiasis, MAb E2-9 (16 \u03bcg/ml, 0.5 ml) was given to na\u00efve mice 4 h before i.v. C. albicans challenge, another 0.2 ml of MAb E2-9 was given 24 h after the first dose.

In addition, passive transfer of MAb E2-9 to na\u00efve mice reduced the kidney fungal burden to a level similar to survivors that were actively immunized as compared to the fungal burden in mice that were given DPBS or absorbed MAb E2-9 (P<0.001) (FIG. 9B). Thus the mice given an i.p dose of MAb E2-9 had prolonged survival as compared to control animals, and reduced fungal burden in their kidneys. Importantly, passive protection was prevented by removal of the MAbs by absorption with Candida cells before transfer, which provided strong additional evidence for the protection being due to the MAb E2-9.",
                                "Thus to summarize the above examples, all six derived peptides (SEQ ID NOS:1-6) induced antibody responses when used alone to pulse DCs for subsequent immunizations, and three peptides Fba (SEQ ID NO:1), Hwp1 (SEQ ID NO:3), and Met6 (SEQ ID NO:2) induced a high degree of protection as evidenced by survival and low kidney fungal burden in mice challenged with the fungus. Vaccinated mice had obviously less fungal burden in kidneys as compared to non-surviving controls; in fact, CFU burden was not detectable in the kidneys of some of the vaccinated mice against the three peptides, whereas this never happened in control groups. Combination of prolonged survival with significantly reduction or clearance of kidney CFU provided strong evidences to show protection induced by vaccines. One particular peptide Fba, which induced robust antibody responses and best protection among three protective peptides, was further characterized as a novel vaccine candidate. The Fba peptide epitope alone is not MHC II restricted as it is immunogenic as demonstrated by specific antibody production in different strains of mice and rabbits. The hyper-immunized animals produced both IgM and IgG classes of antibodies, suggesting production of memory cells and possible long-term immunologic responsiveness.",
                                "We have also shown an effective vaccine composition that provides protection against disseminated candidiasis with a more acceptable formulation for human use, using alum as the adjuvant. Mice immunized with a combination of the Fba peptide and alum showed protection against disseminated candidiasis that was statistically significant in terms of lower kidney CFU's and increased survival as compared to non-immune controls. Antibody activity specific for the Fba peptide appears to be responsible at least in part for the anti-Candida protection, as was demonstrated by experiments involving passive transfer of whole immune serum, which conferred protection to na\u00efve mice. Such protection was not conferred by control pre-bled normal mouse serum and the protection was abrogated when immune serum was pre-absorbed by fungal cells prior to the passive transfer protection test. The protective ability against disseminated candidiasis of MAb E2-9, which is specific for the Fba epitope, was also demonstrated in vivo. We also showed that the Fba peptide epitope is expressed on the fungal cell surface and is accessible by antibodies, thus blockage of adhesion is a reasonable mechanism to investigate.",
                                "Fba1p is a key enzyme required for growth on both fermentative and nonfermentative carbon sources, and this enzyme is essential for viability of C. albicans and other Candida spp. (48). However, Fba1p must be depleted to below 5% of wild-type levels before growth is blocked (48). Fba1p depletion appears to exert static rather than cidal effects upon C. albicans. Therefore, even though the role of Fba1p on the cell surface is unknown, it is possible that antibodies against Fba1p may prevent the growth of C. albicans infecting a patient. Thus, peptide specific MAb E2-9 may have the potential for use as an immunotherapy against disseminated candidiasis either alone or combined with other antifungal drugs. A possible limitation to the use of vaccines in immunosuppressed patients is that these patients may not necessarily mount protective responses, but passive immunization with protective antibodies may be a rapid and effective preventive or even therapeutic measure. The efficacy of this immunoprophylaxis can be augmented when used in combination with conventional antifungal therapy, as it has been shown with Mycograb and amphotericin B (Amp B) in patients with invasive candidiasis (44). MAb B6.1 was also demonstrated to enhance therapeutic efficacy of Amp B, which may lead to a reduction of the amount of the antifungal agent needed for treatment to non-toxic levels (24). E2-9 was shown to bind to the hyphal cell surface, indicating that functional Fba epitope is accessible to antibodies on hyphal cell surfaces; our recent data, however, have shown neither the immune serum nor MAb E2-9 exert a marked inhibition of Candida yeast or hyphal growth in vitro (Data not shown). We believe that a combination of MAb B6-1 and E2-9 could synergistically induce protective immunity in mice. MAb B6.1 antibody had protective activity when given before infection and slight therapeutic activity when given after infection (25). MAb B6.1 is specific to a \u03b2-1,2-linked mannotriose, which is an acid-labile component of the phosphomannan complex of C. albicans. This epitope appears to be a major surface marker, as indicated by confluent distribution patterns revealed by immunofluorescence. The preventive or prophylactic activity of MAb E2-9 against disseminated candidiasis was not compared to that of MAb B6.1. Based on median survival times, both antibodies showed similar protective activities. We believe, that due to the possible different mechanism for protection by those two different MAbs, they will exert a synergistic effect to fulfill solid protection by working together.",

As shown in FIG. 15, the mice immunized with peptides had reduced viable fungal units (colony forming units, CFU) per kidney pairs compared to DPBS control group and DC+CFA control group (P<0.05).",
                                "Thus at least three of the peptides that are expressed by more fungal species were shown to be effective vaccines in mice against a C. albicans challenge. It is expected that they would similarly be effective against the other fungal species that express the same peptide. These peptides can also be linked to the \u03b2-(Man)3 glycan and/or to tetanus toxoid by the methods described below to increase the vaccine effectiveness.",
                                "**Design and Use of Methylated Fba Peptides**",
                                "In an attempt to move the original Fba vaccine to a more acceptable formulation for human use, changes were made to the Fba peptide. First, the Fba peptide was conjugated to a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP), of which the lysine core bears eight copies of the Fba peptide epitope. Second, partial N-methyl scanning of the Fba amino acids and insertion of cysteine residues were applied. Without wishing to be bound by this theory, we believe that these modifications would increase in vivo half-life and immunogenicity of the Fba peptide. The MAP experiments were disappointing (data not shown). For the Fba derivatives, the results using either alum and/or MPL as an adjuvant were more encouraging. All the synthetic peptides were commercially made by GenScript Company.",
                                "Using N-methyl scanning, sites were selected for the introduction of cysteine residues in the Fba 14 amino acid peptide to hopefully increase in vivo half-life and immunogenicity. Eleven peptides were synthesized commercially as shown in FIG. 16, and in Table 1 below. Peptide 1 is the original Fba peptide (SEQ ID NO:1). Peptides 2-9 (SEQ ID NOS:11-18) each had one of the original amino acids methylated but at different positions as described in Table 1. Peptide 10 had two amino acids methylated (SEQ ID NO:19). Peptide 11 (SEQ ID NO:20) had two extra cysteines inserted, one at position 5 and one at position 8.",
                                "These modified Fba peptides were used to test reactivity with anti-Fba immune sera. A microtiter plate was coated with 11 peptides, and anti-Fba serum was tested for its reactivity with these Fba derivatives as described above. The same ELISA was used to test the reaction of anti-Fba antibodies in immune sera with all the 11 peptides, but the plate was coated with peptides 1-11, instead of the original Fba peptide. As shown in FIG. 16, all the modified Fba peptides were recognized by antibody specific for the original Fba. This indicates all of them retained immunoreactivity and may be useful as antigens for vaccines.",
                                "The specificity of anti-Fba antibodies in immune sera was tested for the modified Fba peptides as determined by ELISA inhibition assay. The results for the same test with Fba peptide is shown in FIG. 17. Peptide 1, original Fba, which was used as an inhibitor, was included as a positive control. The inhibition curve of FIG. 17 serves to compare the curves with the other modified peptides 2-11. FIGS. 18A, 18B, 18C, and 18D show the results of ELISA inhibition assays for peptide 2, peptide 3, peptide 4 and peptide 5, respectively. Each methylated peptide was used as an inhibitor in the designated assay. As shown in FIGS. 18A-18D as compared to FIG. 17, methylation at position 1, 2, 3, or 5 seems to have little effect on peptide-antibody binding. The reaction is dose-dependent for each group, indicating anti-Fba antibodies in immune sera were specific for the modified peptides. Similarly, as shown in FIGS. 18E, 18F, 18Q and 18H, methylation of the Fba peptide at position 6, 7, 8, or 9, respectively, did not have significant effect on antibody binding to peptides. Finally, as shown in FIGS. 18I and 18J, peptide 10 (methylated at position 1 and 8) and peptide 11 (two cysteine insertions at position 5 and 8), respectively, bound well to antibody. The binding of peptide 11, which has two extra cysteines may indicate that the binding site of Fba with antibody is located at the carboxyl part of the peptide.",
                                "To test for antibody response as measured using ELISA from serum of mice immunized with the modified peptides, two mice per group with 11 groups for peptides 1 to 11 were used. Mice were i.p. injected three times with 15 \u03bcg peptide mixed with 50 \u03bcg alum, and each injection spaced three weeks apart. As shown in FIG. 19, all modified Fba peptides were able to induce antibody responses, but the response was not as strong as Fba peptide 1.",
                                "All of the modified Fba peptides were tested in mice, using different routes of immunization (intraperitoneal (i.p.) or subcutaneous (s.c.)) and different combinations of human acceptable adjuvants (alum alone or alum+MPL). Each experiment involved two mice per group and was conducted to test if any of peptides induced robust anti-Fba antibody responses in animals. FIG. 20A shows the anti-Fba antibody response in mice immunized with the Fba derivatives by i.p. injection and using peptides in alum. FIG. 20B shows the anti-Fba antibody response in mice immunized with the Fba derivatives by i.p. injection and using peptides in alum and MPL. FIG. 20C shows the anti-Fba antibody response in mice immunized with the Fba derivatives by s.c. injection and using peptides in alum. FIG. 20D shows the anti-Fba antibody response in mice immunized with the Fba derivatives by s.c. injection and using peptides in alum and MPL. As shown in FIGS. 20A-20D, all the modified Fba peptides were able to induce antibody responses, but again not as strong as the original Fba peptide. The immunization route of subcutaneous and a combination of alum & MPL induced the highest antibody responses. For several peptides, better antibody responses were observed when the serum was serially diluted to obtain actual antibody titers. These modified peptides may be used as vaccines for candidiasis. These modified peptides can also be linked to the \u03b2-(Man)3 glycan and/or to tetanus toxoid by the methods described below to increase the vaccine effectiveness."

The T-cell tetradecameric peptide (Fba) was assembled on a peptide synthesizer and a triethylene glycol tether was introduced at the C terminal end followed by a single lysine residue which was derivatized on its side chain by a thioacetic acid residue.

The mice were monitored for development of a moribund state, defined as being listless, disinterested in food or water, and nonreactive to finger probing. At the time that a mouse was deemed moribund, it was sacrificed and their kidneys were homogenized in DPBS and plated onto a nutrient agar to determine colony forming units of fungal cells (CFUs).

                                "As previously described, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate vaccine induced strong antibody responses and protective immunity in BALB/c mice [53] that express the H-2d MHC haplotype and have a Th-2 immunologic bias [3]. C57BL/6 mice express an H-2b MHC haplotype, are more prone to Th1 responses and supposedly more resistant to disseminated candidiasis than are BALB/c mice [3]. As described above in Example 5, using the Fba peptide, immune responses were similar in both mouse strains\u2014BALB/c and C57BL/6. Dendritic cells were derived in vitro as described above and previously [53] and used the same immunization DC/CFA-strategy on the C57BL/6 mice as was used on BALB/c mice [53], which included a priming dose followed by two boosters; the last booster consisted of the vaccine emulsified in CFA. C57BL/6 mice responded to the vaccine by making specific antibody against each of the two vaccine epitopes, i.e., the (3-(Man)3 and the Fba peptide (data not shown). Following the first booster, an isotype switch from IgM to IgG occurred in response to each epitope. The immunized C57BL/6 mice showed 80% survival throughout the 120 days post challenge and survived significantly longer (p<0.001) as compared to the control groups of mice given DPBS buffer, DC or DC+CFA (FIG. 21A). The survival data were consistent with the trend of colony forming units (CFU) in kidney homogenates. That is, immunized C57BL/6 mice had greatly reduced or non-detectable kidney CFU as compared to controls that were sacrificed when they became moribund following i.v. challenge with the fungus (FIG. 21B). Indeed, the protection in C57BL/6 mice was similar to that which we observed for BALB/c mice [53].",
                                "To answer whether antibody responses were responsible for the protection, antisera were collected from separate groups of immunized mice and transferred i.p. to na\u00efve mice 4 h before i.v. challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans strain 3153A. Control groups were given either immune sera pre-absorbed with live C. albicans yeast cells or DPBS buffer prior to the challenge. The immune serum donors, which were immunized with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba by the DC/CFA method, were used as positive controls for protection. After challenge, immunized mice and mice treated with the antiserum had prolonged survival times as compared to the two control groups (p<0.05) (FIG. 21C), and as expected, mice that received the antiserum had significantly reduced fungal counts in their kidneys (p<0.05) (FIG. 21D). These data provide strong evidence that antibodies are responsible, at least in part, for the vaccine-induced protection against a lethal challenge with the fungus in C57BL/6 mice.",
                                "C. albicans strain 3153A was used in our previous studies [7, 17, 19]. To test if DC/CFA vaccination with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba protects C57BL/6 mice challenged with another C. albicans strain, similar to Example 4 above for Fba peptide, we challenged immunized mice with C. albicans strain SC5314, a clinical isolate commonly used in research. As a positive control, a group of immunized mice was challenged with strain 3153A. Similar protection patterns were observed in both groups of mice regardless of the challenge strain (FIG. 21E). In addition to prolonged survival times, immunized groups had reduced or non-detectable CFUs in their kidneys as compared to non-immune mice (data not shown). These results are similar for both the Fba peptide and the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate and to those we observed from BALB/c mice challenged with the 3153A strain [53, 52]. The above experiments, and those in Examples 4 and 5, are important as they show that vaccine-induced antibody protection is not animal or fungal-strain dependent.",

To test new adjuvants suitable for human use, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate was administered as a mixture with either alum or MPL adjuvants in BALB/c mice. Serum samples were collected 14 days after immunization, diluted 1:100 and tested by ELISA on plates coated with synthetic \u03b2-(Man)3 or Fba-MAP. After the first booster immunization, immune sera from vaccinated mice showed modest antibody responses (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 0.7-0.9) to Fba peptide (FIG. 22A) and relatively weak antibody responses (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 0.45-0.55) to \u03b2-(Man)3 epitope (FIG. 22B) As shown in FIG. 22C, the survival was also slightly extended in mice that received \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba in MPL and slight protection was observed when alum was used as the adjuvant as compared to DPBS or adjuvant unimmunized controls.",
                                "Following the second booster immunization, an isotype switch from IgM to IgG of either \u03b2-(Man)3 or Fba specific antibodies was low to negligible in immune sera (data not shown, results summarized in Table 2, below), which suggested that an immune memory response had not occurred. In addition, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba vaccinated groups had insignificantly longer survival times as compared to the two non-immunized control groups after challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans cells (p=0.77) (FIG. 22C).",
                                "In an attempt to increase the antibody and protective responses, the dose of \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate was increased from 2.5 \u03bcg to 10 \u03bcg in the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+alum formulation. FIGS. 23A-23C show a comparison of DC/CFA and alum as adjuvants for induction of immune responses to the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate vaccine. Serum samples were collected 14 days after immunization, diluted 1:100 and tested by ELISA on plates coated with either synthetic Fba-MAP or \u03b2-(Man)3. Immune sera from mice immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba DC/CFA showed greater antibody titers to both the Fba peptide (FIG. 23A) and the \u03b2-(Man)3 epitopes (FIG. 23B) than sera from groups that received \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba in alum. As shown in FIG. 23C, a high degree of protection was induced by the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba pulsed DCs, and slight protection was observed when alum was used as the adjuvant as compared to DPBS, DC+CFA or alum adjuvant unimmunized controls.",
                                "The levels of anti-Fba peptide (FIG. 23A) and anti-\u03b2-(Man)3 (FIG. 23B) were markedly less than antibody levels (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 1.7-1.9) in sera from control animals immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+DC/CFA. Likewise, when titers were assessed by end-point dilution, the immune sera from the positive control group showed significantly greater antibody responses for both epitopes (Table 3, below). Interestingly, even though the antibody titers against both epitopes in response to the 10 microgram dosage was greater than the response to the 2.5 \u03bcg dose, disease protection was not observed to the extent of protection induced by the DC/CFA immunization approach (FIG. 23C). In summary, the greatest antibody responses occurred in mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+DC/CFA, the animals of which also showed evidence of an IgM-IgG shift (Table 3, below) and the highest degree of protection [7].",

Both conjugates were administered as mixtures with alum or MPL. Negative control groups included adjuvant only and DPBS buffer only. FIGS. 24A and 25B show that vaccination with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT in either alum or MPL markedly increased both \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba peptide-specific antibody titers in sensitized mice as compared to controls. Serum samples were collected 14 days after immunization, diluted 1:100 and tested by ELISA on plates coated with cell wall mannan or peptide. MAbs B6.1 and E2-9 that are specific for \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba, respectively, were used as positive controls.",

After the first booster, IgM and IgG antibodies against both epitopes were detected in the sera of mice immunized with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with added alum or MPL adjuvants (Table 2), whereas very low levels of anti-Fba IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in the sera of mice that received Fba or Fba-TT in adjuvant. No antibody against the epitopes was detectable in any of the negative (i.e., adjuvant or DPBS mice) control sera (data not shown). Although the Fba-TT as linked by the method described in Example 21 did not give a good response, this was only an initial trial using only one type of linker for the Fba and TT. It is believed that linking tetanus toxoid by other methods known in the field (63, 64, 65) or to tetanus TH epitopes (e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0101534 can produce a peptide conjugate that would give a stronger response.",

FIGS. 25A-D show results of using \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate with or without adjuvant markedly as analyzed by antibody titers and protection against disseminated candidiasis.

FIG. 25C shows that protective immunity was induced by \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT when either alum or MPL was used as the adjuvant. Protection was nearly as great even when adjuvant was omitted as compared to DPBS or adjuvant only controls (P<0.01).

Surprisingly, mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT without adjuvant responded only slightly, but not significantly, less than those that received the vaccine plus adjuvant (FIGS. 25A and 25B). Importantly, all three groups of mice, vaccinated with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine with or without additional adjuvant, showed a high degree of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans (FIG. 25C). The induced protective immunity was evidenced by significantly prolonged survival times (p<0.005) and reduced kidney fungal burden (p<0.001) as compared to control groups that received only adjuvants or DPBS buffer prior to challenge (FIG. 25D).

To confirm that vaccine-induced antibodies are protective regardless of the use of dendritic cells, immune sera were collected and pooled from \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT (with or without alum or MPL adjuvants) immunized mice and transferred i.p. to na\u00efve mice 4 h before i.v. challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans. Control groups were given either immune serum pre-absorbed with live C. albicans yeast cells or DPBS buffer prior to the challenge. Antibodies were tested against the \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba epitopes before and after absorption with yeast cells. Immune serum donors, which were immunized with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine, were used as a positive control for protection. After challenge, immunized positive control mice and mice treated with the antiserum had prolonged survival times as compared to the two negative control groups (p<0.01) (FIG. 26A), confirming that induced antibodies were protective and that their induction was not dependent on the use of dendritic cells or CFA during the immunizations. Consistently, mice that received the antiserum had significantly fewer fungal counts in their kidneys compared with the infectious burden in mice that were given DPBS or pre-absorbed serum prior to challenge (p<0.001) (FIG. 26B).",

                                "The isotype distribution of antibodies specific for the fungal epitopes differed depending on the adjuvant system (Table 2). Whereas IgM and IgG1 responses to \u03b2-(Man)3 were induced regardless of the presence of adjuvant, an IgG2a response to the glycan epitope was induced by \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with or without the use of alum or MPL, but IgG1 was the only subclass detectable in mice immunized by the DC/CFA approach. Only mice immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT mixed with MPL produced an IgG2b response to the glycan epitope. Antibody IgM and IgG1 isotype responses to the Fba peptide were similar for mice immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba regardless of the adjuvant system, however, IgG2a specific for the peptide epitope was induced only by \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with alum or when no adjuvant was used. No IgG2a isotype was detected against the peptide when MPL was the test adjuvant. The level of protection observed against disseminated candidiasis was similar in mice immunized with the glycan-peptide conjugate in the DC/CFA approach, or in mice immunized with the glycan-peptide-TT with or without alum or MPL, which indicated that the protective antibodies are likely to be primarily of the IgM and IgG1 isotypes.",

Fourteen days following the last booster, immunized mice were infected via the tail vein with a lethal dose of C. albicans 3153A, as described above. Similar to the findings in BALB/c mice, the outbred mice vaccinated with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine, when administered alone or with alum and MPL, markedly improved the survival of infected mice (FIG. 27C). Protective immunity was induced by \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with or without adjuvant as noted by their prolonged survival time as compared to control mice that received DPBS or adjuvants alone (P<0.01).

Immune serum from \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT vaccinated mice detected the presence of the vaccine epitopes on the surface of C. albicans, as shown by flow cytometry. FIG. 28A shows antibodies in immune sera binding to the both epitopes expressed on the C. albicans cell surface, and shown that the reactivity of immune serum with live C. albicans cells to that of MAb B6.1, which is specific for the C. albicans cell surface epitope \u03b2-(Man)3. Control serum was non-immune serum from mice that received adjuvant only. FIG. 28B shown pre-absorbed MAb B6.1 and pre-absorbed immune sera were not reactive with fungal cell surface. FIG. 28C are micrographs from confocal microscopic analyses, confirming that antibodies in immune serum detected the vaccine epitopes on the surface of yeast forms, but were also reactive with the surface of hyphal forms of C. albicans. The epitope display was similar to that due to fungal reactivity with MAb B6.1, which is specific for \u03b2-(Man)3 and was used as a positive immunofluorescence control. As an additional negative control, immune serum pre-absorbed with C. albicans 3153A yeast cells did not react with either yeast or hyphal forms of C. albicans.",
                                "Thus, a fluorescence shift similar in magnitude to the control antibody, MAb B6.1, was observed upon testing of the immune serum (FIG. 28A). This reactivity of immune serum was removed by pre-absorption with C. albicans yeast forms (FIG. 28B). The binding pattern was similar with immune sera collected from mice vaccinated with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT alone, or when mixed with either alum or MPL (data not shown).",

The microscopic analysis confirmed the flow cytometry results and extended the observations to include hyphal forms of the fungus. The specific antibody reactivity was again confirmed by the absence of fluorescence by immune serum pre-absorbed with yeast forms of the fungus (FIG. 28C). As with the flow cytometry analyses, the positive reaction of immune serum compared favorably with reactivity of MAb B6.1, which is specific for the glycan epitope [26]. Moreover, essentially the same pattern of C. albicans fluorescence was observed with immune serum from mice vaccinated with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT alone, or when mixed with alum/MPL. No reactivity with the fungus was observed upon testing of serum from mice given adjuvant only or pooled serum from untreated normal mice. In addition to these findings, serum from mice immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate reacted similarly with another C. albicans isolate (strain SC5314) (data not shown).",
                                "To summarize the above, the vaccine effectiveness has been shown to include C57BL/6 mice, which are more prone to Th1 responses and more resistant to disseminated candidiasis as compared to the BALB/c mice. By the same DC/CFA-based immunization protocols that favored production of protective antibody, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate induced a similar level of protection in C57BL/6 mice as found for BALB/c animals. Furthermore, protection was observed regardless of the challenge strain of C. albicans. As with the BALB/c mice, passive transfer of antibodies against the two fungal epitopes to C57BL/6 na\u00efve mice protected these animals against disseminated candidiasis.",
                                "To increase the immunogenicity of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate when using an acceptable immunization approach for human use, the effects of coupling the conjugate to tetanus toxoid (TT) was tested, and the new glycopeptide vaccine conjugate, \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT, proved to be highly immunogenic as it induced robust antibody responses when administered with either alum or MPL as adjuvants. Moreover, prior to the second booster dose, an isotype switch occurred from IgM to IgG antibodies against for both the \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba peptide epitopes. This result indicated a memory cell response and, a vaccine that could induce long-term immunity. Most importantly, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate administered with either alum or MPL induced protection against disseminated candidiasis on a par with the high level of protection observed with the original DC/CFA immunization approach [7].",
                                "\u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT was also administered alone and compared to administration of the conjugate as either a mixture made with alum or MPL. Mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate prepared in either adjuvant responded as expected by making robust antibody responses. Surprisingly, mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT without any adjuvant also responded well. All three groups of vaccinated mice showed a high level of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans as evidenced by significantly increased survival times and reduced or non-detectable kidney fungal burden at the time of sacrifice as compared to control groups that received only adjuvants or DPBS buffer prior to challenge. Furthermore, sera from mice immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate transferred protection against disseminated candidiasis to na\u00efve mice, whereas C. albicans-preabsorbed immune sera did not, which confirmed that induced antibodies were protective. These results demonstrate that the addition of the TT to the vaccine conjugate provided sufficient self-adjuvanting activity without the need for additional adjuvant, which supports the use of self-adjuvanting glycopeptide as vaccines.",
                                "The efficacy of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine in prolonging the survival of mice after a lethal challenge with C. albicans was also demonstrated in outbred mice. The \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine was immunogenic in Swiss Webster mice in the absence of an adjuvant, eliciting strong glycan- and peptide-specific antibodies and induced protection against candidiasis. Vaccine-mediated protection in this outbred mouse model was associated with a reduction in the levels of CFU in kidneys. Taken together, no evidence was found that protection had an MHC bias as evidenced by vaccine efficacy in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, and the vaccine effectiveness in outbred mice provides further support that this formulation can induce protection in humans as well. Without wishing to be found by this theory, we believe that establishment of active immunity when the host is immunologically normal will protect that host upon an immunocompromised event later.",

The specificity of the response was confirmed to both the glycan and peptide epitopes by inhibition ELISA, in which free soluble \u03b2-(Man)3 or Fba peptide inhibited the binding of antibodies in immune sera in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The binding of the specific antibodies to the actual fungal cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses, which demonstrated binding to C. albicans yeast forms, and by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showing antibody reactivity with yeast and hyphal forms.",

The \u03b1-amino group was protected with Fmoc, and the 6-amino group was protected with ivDde (1-(4,4-Dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclo-hexylidene)-3-methylbutyl). Then a new linker was used to introduce a triethylene glycol spacer. The Fba peptide was then elaborated at the N terminus of this new linker. Prior to cleavage from the resin, the N terminus was either N-acetylated to provide a control reference peptide, or thiolproprionic acid was added to provide the thiol to link to Compound 3. For both the control peptide and the glycosylated peptide the ivDde group was removed, and the S-acetylthioglycolic acid was added to the \u03c9-amino group of lysine. This provided a reactive C-terminal thiol group that could then conjugate either the Fba peptide 1 or the Man3-Fba peptide 4 to tetanus toxoid. Tetanus toxoid was activated for conjugation by first introducing bromoacetate groups to accessible lysine residues in the carrier protein, and then reacting them with the tetanus toxoid peptide. Reacting Compounds 1 and 5 yielded the control conjugate 6. Reacting glycopeptide 4 with 5 yielded the vaccine conjugate 7. The final conjugates used for the immunization and challenge experiments were Compounds 6 and 7."

The number of N\u03b1-Fmoc deprotection steps varied from cycle to cycle, depending on the detection of Fmoc-piperidine adduct in the effluent, following up to four initial treatments of the resin-bound peptide with 20% piperidine in NMP. The concentration of Fmoc-piperidine adduct formed after each treatment was measured with a Perkin-Elmer Series 200 UV detector using an aliquot of deprotection effluent, diluted in methanol. Following the second and third treatments, measurement of a signal weaker than 4.5% of that measured after the first treatment indicated completion and automatically concluded deprotection for the cycle. If the third treatment did not meet this condition, then the synthesizer performed additional treatments of 8 minutes each until a signal less than or equal to 300 units was measured.",
                                "Next, 1 mmol of the corresponding N\u03b1-Fmoc amino acid derivative held in a sealed Teflon cartridge was dissolved in 3 mL NMP. Then 0.9 mmol HBTU was added to the cartridge to produce the corresponding aminoacyl HOBt ester in the presence of 1 mmol HOBt and 2 mmol DIPEA. Nitrogen gas pressure transferred the active ester from the cartridge to the resin, and mechanical vortexing of the resin in its reactor vessel accelerated permeation of the solid support to promote rapid reaction. Treatment with a capping solution of 0.5M acetic anhydride, 0.014M HOBt, and 0.129M DIPEA was used to truncate unreacted peptide chains and prevent synthesis of deletion sequences. The synthesis was completed by a final cycle in which the N\u03b1-Fmoc group was removed by the previously described deprotection step, and the resin-bound peptide was thoroughly washed with NMP and then DCM. In the manual peptide reactor, the resin was treated 5 times with 10 mL DCM and 5 times with 10 mL methanol, and subsequently dried under vacuum. The mass of resin and resin-bound protected peptide was 708 mg (80% yield by crude mass)."
