    "title": "Self-Adjuvanting Glycopeptide Conjugate Vaccine against Disseminated Candidiasis",

    "abstract": "Our research on pathogenesis of disseminated candidiasis led to the discovery that antibodies specific for Candida albicans cell surface \u03b2-1, 2-mannotriose [\u03b2-(Man)(3)] protect mice. A 14 mer peptide Fba, which derived from the N-terminal portion of the C. albicans cytosolic/cell surface protein fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, was used as the glycan carrier and resulted in a novel synthetic glycopeptide vaccine \u03b2-(Man)(3)-Fba. By a dendritic cell-based immunization approach, this conjugate induced protective antibody responses against both the glycan and peptide parts of the vaccine. In this report, we modified the \u03b2-(Man)(3)-Fba conjugate by coupling it to tetanus toxoid (TT) in order to improve immunogenicity and allow for use of an adjuvant suitable for human use. By new immunization procedures entirely compatible with human use, the modified \u03b2-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT was administered either alone or as a mixture made with alum or monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants and given to mice by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route. Mice vaccinated with or, surprisingly, without adjuvant responded well by making robust antibody responses. The immunized groups showed a high degree of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans as evidenced by increased survival times and reduced kidney fungal burden as compared to control groups that received only adjuvant or DPBS buffer prior to challenge. To confirm that induced antibodies were protective, sera from mice immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT conjugate transferred protection against disseminated candidiasis to na\u00efve mice, whereas C. albicans-absorbed immune sera did not. Similar antibody responses and protection induced by the \u03b2-(Man)(3)-Fba-TT vaccine was observed in inbred BALB/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. We conclude that addition of TT to the glycopeptide conjugate results in a self-adjuvanting vaccine that promotes robust antibody responses without the need for additional adjuvant, which is novel and represents a major step forward in vaccine design against disseminated candidiasis.",

                "Hematogenously disseminated candidiasis in humans has become the third or fourth leading cause of hospital-acquired blood stream infections and despite antifungal therapy at least 40% of affected individuals will die of this disease [1], [2]. It's estimated that 60\u201370,000 cases of disseminated candidiasis occur per year in the US alone, and associated health care costs are $2\u20134 billion/year [3]. The limited number and toxicity of antifungal agents, and, most importantly, the poor outcome of almost half of the number of candidemia patients treated with appropriate antifungal therapy, militates in favor of disease prevention, possibly through active and passive immunization strategies [4]\u2013[6]. Strong evidence has accumulated in the last decade that antibodies specific for certain cell surface epitopes of fungi may be beneficial for the fungal-infected host [7]\u2013[13]. In addition, if a vaccine maintains a long-lived protective antibody titer, we argue that this form of disease prevention could be induced and protect individuals who will enter into a possible transient immunocompromised state, such as those patients who will have elective abdominal or other surgical procedures that will place them at risk of developing candidiasis.",
                "Depending on the clinical setting there is a wide spectrum of Candida species that may cause disseminated candidiasis, but C. albicans continues to be prevalent overall and this species is the most virulent in experimental animals [14], [15]. Antibodies have long been considered irrelevant in host defense against invasive candidiasis, but over the last two decades a number of antibodies or their engineered derivatives directed against C. albicans cell-wall polysaccharides and glycopeptides, as well as against some protein or peptide epitopes, have been shown to confer protection [6], [12], [16], [17]. We previously demonstrated that complement-fixing antibodies that recognize C. albicans cell surface \u03b2-1,2-linked mannotriose [\u03b2-(Man)3] protect mice against candidiasis [18], [19]. Our finding that a C. albicans cell surface peptide Fba, derived from the N-terminal portion of C. albicans cell wall protein fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, may serve as an immunologic carrier for the glycan has resulted in a novel fully synthetic glycopeptide vaccine [7]. Following immunizations of mice, protection was afforded by antibodies specific for the \u03b2-(Man)3 and the Fba epitopes that comprised the vaccine [7]. The antibody dependency of protection was evident by protection transferred to na\u00efve mice by immune serum, but not by serum pre-absorbed with C. albicans. These results enabled elucidation of an efficacious vaccine, but the immunization protocol utilized dendritic cells and complete Freund adjuvant (DC/CFA), which are cost prohibitive and incompatible for human use, respectively. In this report, we have investigated alternative vaccine presentation strategies to test our hypothesis that an approved human adjuvant can be substituted for the DC/CFA approach provided that the vaccine conjugate can be appropriately modified to improve immunogenicity.",
                "Prior to vaccine modification, we expanded our observation on efficacy of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba vaccine in additional mouse strains and against challenge with an additional C. albicans strain, and tested whether the vaccine could be administered with alum or monnophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvants in place of DC/CFA. In subsequent experiments, the vaccine modification was the covalent coupling of tetanus toxoid (TT) to the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba. The \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate was administered alone or as a mixture made with alum or MPL. The best protection results occurred in animals immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine with, or, surprisingly, without additional adjuvant. This self-adjuvanting \u03b2- (Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine, administered without any additional adjuvant, induced robust antibody responses and antibody-mediated protection in mice."

                        "As we described, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate vaccine induced strong antibody responses and protective immunity in BALB/c mice [7] that express the H-2d MHC haplotype and have a Th-2 immunologic bias [20], [21]. C57BL/6 mice express an H-2b MHC haplotype, are more prone to Th1 responses and supposedly more resistant to disseminated candidiasis than are BALB/c mice [21]\u2013[23]. We derived dendritic cells in vitro as described before [7] and used the same immunization DC/CFA-strategy on the C57BL/6 mice as was used in our work on BALB/c mice [7], which included a priming dose followed by two boosters; the last booster consisted of the vaccine emulsified in CFA. C57BL/6 mice responded to the vaccine by making specific antibody against each of the two vaccine epitopes, i.e., the \u03b2-(Man)3 and the Fba peptide (data not shown). Following the first booster, an isotype switch from IgM to IgG occurred in response to each epitope. The immunized C57BL/6 mice showed 80% survival throughout the 120 days post challenge and survived significantly longer (p<0.001) as compared to the control groups of mice given DPBS buffer, DC or DC+CFA (Figure S1A). The survival data were consistent with the trend of colony forming units (CFU) in kidney homogenates. That is, immunized C57BL/6 mice had greatly reduced or non-detectable kidney CFU as compared to controls that were sacrificed when they became moribund following i.v. challenge with the fungus (Figure S1B). Indeed, the protection in C57BL/6 mice was similar to that which we observed for BALB/c mice [7].",
                        "To answer whether antibody responses were responsible for the protection, antisera were collected from separate groups of immunized mice and transferred i.p. to na\u00efve mice 4 h before i.v. challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans strain 3153A. Control groups were given either immune sera pre-absorbed with live C. albicans yeast cells or DPBS buffer prior to the challenge. The immune serum donors, which were immunized with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba by the DC/CFA method, were used as positive controls for protection. After challenge, immunized mice and mice treated with the antiserum had prolonged survival times as compared to the two control groups (p<0.05) (Figure S1C), and as expected, mice that received the antiserum had significantly reduced fungal counts in their kidneys (p<0.05) (Figure S1D). These data provide strong evidence that antibodies are responsible, at least in part, for the vaccine-induced protection against a lethal challenge with the fungus in C57BL/6 mice.",
                        "C. albicans strain 3153A was used in our previous studies [7], [17], [19]. To test if DC/CFA vaccination with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba protects C57BL/6 mice challenged with another C. albicans strain, we challenged immunized mice with C. albicans strain SC5314, a clinical isolate commonly used in research. As a positive control, a group of immunized mice was challenged with strain 3153A. Similar protection patterns were observed in both groups of mice regardless of the challenge strain (Figure S1E). In addition to prolonged survival times, immunized groups had reduced or non-detectable CFUs in their kidneys as compared to non-immune mice (data not shown). These results are similar to those we observed from BALB/c mice challenged with the 3153A strain [7], [19]. The above experiments are important as they show that vaccine-induced antibody protection is not animal or fungal-strain dependent."

                        "Although the DC/CFA -based immunization approach was successful in mice for protection against disseminated candidiasis, the use of DC and complete Freund adjuvant are inappropriate for human use. To test new adjuvants suitable for human use, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate was administered as a mixture with either alum or MPL adjuvants. After the first booster, immune sera from vaccinated mice showed modest antibody responses (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 0.7\u20130.9) to the Fba peptide (Figure 1A), and relatively weak antibody responses (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 0.45\u20130.55) to the \u03b2-(Man)3 epitope (Figure 1B). Following the second booster immunization, an isotype switch from IgM to IgG of either \u03b2-(Man)3 or Fba specific antibodies was low to negligible in immune sera (data not shown, results summarized in table 1), which suggested that an immune memory response had not occurred. In addition, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba vaccinated groups had insignificantly longer survival times as compared to the two non-immunized control groups after challenge with a lethal dose of C. albicans cells (p\u200a=\u200a0.77) (Figure 1C).",
                        "In an attempt to increase the antibody and protective responses, the dose of \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate was increased from 2.5 \u00b5g to 10 \u00b5g in the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+alum formulation. Nonetheless, the levels of anti-Fba peptide (Figure 2A) and anti-\u03b2-(Man)3 (Figure 2B) were markedly less than antibody levels (OD values of a 1/100 serum dilution: 1.7\u20131.9) in sera from control animals immunized with the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+DC/CFA. Likewise, when titers were assessed by end-point dilution, the immune sera from the positive control group showed significantly greater antibody responses for both epitopes (Table 2 & 3). Interestingly, even though the antibody titers against both epitopes in response to the 10 microgram dosage was greater than the response to the 2.5 \u00b5g dose, disease protection was not observed to the extent of protection induced by the DC/CFA immunization approach (Figure 2C). In summary, the greatest antibody responses occurred in mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba+DC/CFA, the animals of which also showed evidence of an IgM-IgG shift (Table 2 & 3) and the highest degree of protection [7]."

Mice that received the vaccine prepared in either adjuvant responded as expected by making robust antibody responses. Surprisingly, mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT without adjuvant responded only slightly, but not significantly, less than those that received the vaccine plus adjuvant (Figure 4A+4B). Importantly, all three groups of mice, vaccinated with \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine with or without additional adjuvant, showed a high degree of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans (Figure 4C).

The novel fully synthetic \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba glycopeptide vaccine, which is based on two C. albicans cell surface epitopes, induces impressive protection against disseminated candidiasis in BALB/c mice [7]. Furthermore, in previous work we provided strong evidence that antibodies specific for the glycan and peptide epitopes contribute to the protection [17], [29], [30].",

By the same DC/CFA-based immunization protocols that favored production of protective antibody, the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate induced a similar level of protection in C57BL/6 mice as we found for BALB/c animals. Furthermore, protection was observed regardless of the challenge strain of C. albicans. As with the BALB/c mice, passive transfer of antibodies against the two fungal epitopes to C57BL/6 na\u00efve mice protected these animals against disseminated candidiasis.",
                "For the present and previous studies, the antigen-pulsed DC/CFA immunization approach proved to be a powerful way of overcoming the relatively weak immune response of the mouse to the defined small glycan and peptide antigens that comprised the vaccine. This immunization approach enabled us to arrive at the defined vaccine composition [\u03b2-(Man)3-Fba] that provides a high degree of protection against experimental hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. The critical limitation of the immunization approach is the use of DC and CFA, the former of which would severely limit widespread vaccine use in humans and the latter of which is unacceptable for human use. For those reasons we tested the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba along with alum and MPL as adjuvants in place of DC and CFA. However, relatively weak anti-\u03b2-(Man)3 and moderate anti-Fba responses were induced. Perhaps more importantly, the new immunization approaches failed to induce an IgM to IgG isotype shift, suggesting the lack of a memory cell response. In addition, only the mice immunized with a combination of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate and alum showed evidence of protection, and even that group of animals was not protected nearly as well as animals immunized by the DC/CFA approach. The results did not improve by increasing the dose of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba conjugate from 2.5 \u00b5g to 10 \u00b5g, which led us to investigate modifications of the vaccine itself.",

The new glycopeptide vaccine conjugate, \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT, proved to be highly immunogenic as it induced robust antibody responses when administered with either alum or MPL as adjuvants. Moreover, prior to the second booster dose, an isotype switch occurred from IgM to IgG antibodies against for both the \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba peptide epitopes. This result indicated a possible memory cell response and, perhaps, a vaccine that induces long-term immunity. Most importantly, the (\u03b2-Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate administered with either alum or MPL induced protection against disseminated candidiasis on a par with the high level of protection observed with the original DC/CFA immunization approach [7].",
                "In previous work involving the DC/CFA immunization approach, we found that the Fba peptide itself was immunogenic, inducing not only a robust antibody response, but the response was protective as well against disseminated candidiasis [8], [17]. We were surprised, therefore, to find that the Fba-TT conjugate in adjuvant did not perform well in mice (Figure 3A & Table 3). We do not yet know the reason for this, but possibilities to consider include immune interference caused by the acetylated modification at the N-terminus (Figure 8) and, possibly, modifications may be required of the tether between the small Fba moiety and the TT.",
                "The large differences in vaccine efficacy between glycopeptide conjugates \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba and \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT when the same adjuvant system was used led us to consider whether the tetanus toxoid component was sufficient for inducing a protective immune response. To test this hypothesis, \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT administered alone was compared to administration of the conjugate as either a mixture made with alum or MPL. Mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate prepared in either adjuvant responded as expected by making robust antibody responses. Surprisingly, mice that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT without any adjuvant also responded well. All three groups of vaccinated mice showed a high level of protection against a lethal challenge with C. albicans as evidenced by significantly increased survival times and reduced or non-detectable kidney fungal burden at the time of sacrifice as compared to control groups that received only adjuvants or DPBS buffer prior to challenge. Furthermore, sera from mice immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate transferred protection against disseminated candidiasis to na\u00efve mice, whereas C. albicans-preabsorbed immune sera did not, which confirmed that induced antibodies were protective. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the addition of the TT to the vaccine conjugate provided sufficient self-adjuvanting activity without the need for additional adjuvant. This is the first report of which we are aware of a self-adjuvanting glycopeptide vaccine against any infectious disease. Prior to our work, immunostimulatory lipids conjugated to peptide antigens resulted in self-adjuvanting (lipopeptide) vaccines now tested in clinical trials [31], [32]. The lipid parts of the lipopeptide vaccines ranged from simple single fatty acid chains to complex lipids and glycolipids. Several self-adjuvanting mRNA vaccines, administered by an intradermal route, also induced anti-tumor immune responses [33]. We show in our study, however, that the coupling of a carrier protein component (TT) to the glycopeptide vaccine resulted in a self-adjuvanting conjugate, which lays the foundation for the novel concept of self-adjuvanting glycopeptide vaccines.",
                "Protein carriers can influence the specificity, function, avidity, and idiotype of the antibody response to polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines [34]. We compared antibody isotype distribution of responses to both \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba peptide epitopes in immune sera from mice vaccinated against \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba or \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with different adjuvant systems. IgM specific for both fungal epitopes was detected in sera of all immunized animals. IgG1 against the two epitopes was produced in sera of mice immunized with either \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba pulsed DC or \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with or without adjuvant. Interestingly, conjugation of TT to \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba led to the appearance of IgG2a specific for \u03b2-(Man)3 and Fba peptide epitopes. In contrast, the antibody responses to \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba without adjuvant, or with either alum or MPL as adjuvant consisted only of IgM antibodies. IgG1 and IgG2a were the major IgG subclasses against both the fungal glycan part and peptide parts of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate, but when MPL was used as adjuvant, the IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses were detected with specificity for the \u03b2-(Man)3 epitope only. In the mouse, IgG2a and IgG3 efficiently fix complement and promote opsonophagocytosis [35]\u2013[38], and IgG2a binds to the high-affinity macrophage Fc\u03b3 receptor [39]. These considerations may well explain the higher level of protection against candidiasis that was observed in mice immunized against the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT with or without adjuvant as compared to those that received the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba formulation with adjuvant. Although the mechanism of protection afforded by antibodies specific for the Fba peptide part of the vaccine is under investigation, the importance of complement fixation for protection provided by antibodies specific for the \u03b2-(Man)3 has been established [18], [19]. These results show that TT not only enhances the immunogenicity of the glycopeptide vaccine, but also obviates the use of adjuvants.",
                "Antibodies induced by non-DC/CFA approaches are apparently responsible for the protection against disseminated candidiasis. This was demonstrated by passive transfer of immune serum, which conferred protection to naive animals. Moreover, such protection was not conferred by normal serum from non-immunized mice or by immune serum pre-absorbed by C. albicans yeast forms. These results were not surprising since our previous work showed that immune serum from mice immunized against the fungal glycan [25], [29], monoclonal antibodies specific for the glycan [25], [29], [40], and monoclonal antibody specific for the Fba peptide component [17] of the vaccine all conferred protection when given to na\u00efve animals.",
                "The efficacy of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine in prolonging the survival of mice after a lethal challenge with C. albicans was also demonstrated in outbred mice. The \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT conjugate vaccine was immunogenic in Swiss Webster mice in the absence of an adjuvant, eliciting strong glycan- and peptide-specific antibodies and induced protection against candidiasis. Vaccine-mediated protection in this outbred mouse model was associated with a reduction in the levels of CFU in kidneys. Taken together, we found no evidence that protection had an MHC bias as evidenced by vaccine efficacy in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, and the vaccine effectiveness in outbred mice provides further support that this formulation may induce protection in humans as well. We also expect that establishment of active immunity when the host is immunologically normal will then protect that host upon an immunocompromised event later. This expectation is based on our findings that antibodies specific for the glycan part of the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT vaccine enhanced resistance to disseminated candidiasis of normal and neutropenic mice [29], [41]. This is an important fundamental question because a prevalent risk factor for enhancement of susceptibility to disseminated candidiasis in humans and mice is neutropenia.",
                "Detection of specific antibodies induced by the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT vaccine were determined by ELISA in which wells of the plate were coated with either \u03b2-(Man)3 conjugated to bovine serum albumin or Fba peptide as a MAP conjugate to detect anti-glycan and peptide antibodies, respectively. We also confirmed the specificity of the response to both the glycan and peptide epitopes by inhibition ELISA, in which free soluble \u03b2-(Man)3 or Fba peptide inhibited the binding of antibodies in immune sera in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The binding of the specific antibodies to the actual fungal cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometric analyses, which demonstrated binding to C. albicans yeast forms, and by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showing antibody reactivity with yeast and hyphal forms, which is consistent with our reported observations on monoclonal antibodies specific for the two fungal epitopes [17], [25].",
                "In other work, conjugates made of the synthetic glycan covalently linked to tetanus toxoid was immunogenic in rabbits [42], [43], but was poorly immunogenic in mice [43]. In the present work, the conjugate became highly immunogenic upon inclusion of the Fba peptide [\u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT]. Since the Fba peptide alone induces protection [7], [17], its' inclusion in the vaccine construct not only increases immunogenicity, but also provides the host with a dual immune recognition formulation to ensure protection even against C. albicans mutants that may have lost the ability to express one of the two vaccine epitopes. Additional rationale for keeping the glycan as part of the vaccine is that, although the Fba peptide is unique to C. albicans, responses against the \u03b2-(Man)3 would be expected to protect against infection with a variety of other clinically important Candida species [15], including C. tropicalis [29], [44], C. lusitaniae [45], C. guilliermondii [46], [47] and the majority of C. glabrata strains [48], [49].",
                "In summary, the development of an effective vaccine against disseminated candidiasis represents an alternative to the often ineffective antifungal drug therapeutic approach to management of this disease. The findings in the present study indicate that the \u03b2-(Man)3-Fba-TT glycopeptide vaccine is a promising candidate for disease prevention. In a recent study, we obtained evidence that antibody responses to at least the Fba component of the vaccine can be expected to occur even in mice modified to possess gastrointestinal tract colonization with the fungus and are producing serum antibodies in response to the colonization [16]. This modified mouse model more closely simulates the situation in most humans, thus providing additional confidence for going forward with our vaccine approach in humans."

The \u03b2-1,2 mannotriose derivatized with a triethylene glycol spacer 1 was synthesized as previously described [50]. The T-cell tetradecameric peptide (Fba) was assembled on a peptide synthesizer and a triethylene glycol tether was introduced at the C terminal end followed by a single lysine residue which was derivatized on its side chain by a thioacetic acid residue. This gave the building blocks 2a or 2b. Bromoacetate groups were introduced on approximately 20 of the lysine residues present in tetanus toxoid (State Serum Institute, Cophenhagen) to give 3. GV was assembled by reacting 1 with 2a and then conjugating this product with 3. CV was prepared by conjugating 2b with 3. A detailed account of this synthesis will be reported elsewhere (Cartmell et al. Carbohydr. Res submitted)."
