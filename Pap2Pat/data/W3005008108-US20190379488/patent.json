    "abstract": "A system and method for reducing the OFDM out-of-band emissions (OOBE) and Inter-Numerology Interference (INI) in a mixed-numerology OFDM-based system by utilizing a transmitter windowing operation that smooths the inherent rectangular pulse shape of the OFDM signals. The technique retains the main design of the OFDM receivers and provides backward compatibility for the existing OFDM-based systems. The guard band and the multi-window parameters that control the guard duration are jointly optimized regarding the numerology, the use case and the power offset between the users. To fully exploit and further increase the potential of adaptive guards, an interference-based scheduling algorithm is proposed as well.",

                        "The next generation wireless communication technologies are envisioned to support a diverse service variety under the same network. As a recent example, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has defined the main use cases that are going to be supported in the fifth generation (5G) mobile network as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultrareliable low-latency communications (URLLC) as shown in FIG. 1. The applications which demand high data rate and better spectral efficiency fall into the eMBB category, whereas the ones which require ultra-high connection density and low power consumption fall into the mMTC category. Commonly, the industrial sensors and medical implants should operate for many years without a maintenance need, and accordingly, high energy efficiency and low device complexity are important for these mMTC services. Moreover, the mission-critical applications such as remote surgery or self-driving vehicles are categorized in URLLC. A flexible air interface is needed to meet these demanding service requirements under various channel conditions and system scenarios. Hence, the waveform, which is the main component of any air interface, must be designed precisely to facilitate such flexibility.",
                        "Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is the most popular waveform that is currently being used in various standards such as 4G LTE and the IEEE 802.11 family. OFDM provides several tempting features such as efficient hardware implementation, low-complexity equalization, and easy multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) integration. On the other hand, OFDM seriously suffers from its high out-of-band emissions (OOBE), peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and strict synchronization requirement. In addition, 4G LTE adopted a uniform OFDM parameter configuration in pursuit of orthogonality and cannot serve different needs efficiently. Although numerous waveforms have been proposed considering all these disadvantages for the upcoming 5G standard, OFDM remains as the waveform of the new radio with a flexible waveform parametrization (a.k.a. numerology). The flexibility parameters include but are not limited to CP rate, subcarrier spacing, and window/filter parameters.",
                        "The channel conditions, use cases, and system scenarios are the most critical considerations for the numerology design. For instance, a time-localized pulse shape is preferable for time-dispersive channels (i.e., high delay spread scenario), while a frequency-localized pulse shape is more suitable for frequency-dispersive channels (i.e., high Doppler spread scenario). Particularly, the frequency domain localization is crucial for asynchronous transmissions across adjacent sub-bands. Another degree of freedom, the subcarrier spacing in OFDM systems, should be kept large to handle the Doppler spread in a highly mobile environment. On the other hand, a smaller subcarrier spacing provides a longer symbol duration and decreases the relative redundancy that is allocated for time dispersion. The reduced redundancy is especially important for the eMBB services. Furthermore, reliability and latency are vital for mission-critical communications where errors and retransmissions are less tolerable. Thus, a strict frequency localization and a short symbol duration (i.e., large subcarrier spacing) are more practical for the URLLC applications. Also, mMTC operates at a low power level to save energy and might seriously suffer from interference in an asynchronous heterogeneous network. Therefore, a more localized pulse shape in the frequency domain is more suitable in this case.",
                        "An efficient numerology design ensures better utilization of spectral resources and will be one of the core technologies to embrace diverse requirements in the new radio. However, managing the coexistence of multiple numerologies in the same network is challenging. Although OFDM numerologies are orthogonal in the time domain, any mismatch in parametrization, such as subcarrier spacing, leads to inter-numerology interference (INI) in the frequency domain. Typically, the interference level is managed by various windowing/filtering approaches along with the guard allocation. The windowing/filtering operations reduce the OOBE, but they need an extra period which extends the guard duration between the consecutive OFDM symbols. Also, additional guard bands are still required between adjacent channels to deal with the INI. In other words, better interference mitigation is realized with the cost of reduced spectral efficiency. Accordingly, the future communication systems have to optimize the guards in both time and frequency domains to improve the spectral efficiency.",
                        "Accordingly, what is needed in the art is an improved system and method for reducing inter-numerology interference (INI) in an OFDM-based communication system employing mixed numerology."

The windowing approach preserves the essential structure of the OFDM receivers and provides backward compatibility for the current OFDM-based systems. The guard band and the window parameters that handle the guard band duration are optimized jointly regarding the subcarrier spacing, use case, and power offset between the numerologies. Also, the multi-window technique provides managing each side of the spectrum independently in the case of an asymmetric interference scenario. Since the allowed interference level depends upon the numerologies operating in the adjacent bands, the potential of adaptive guards is further increased and exploited with an interference-based scheduling algorithm. The propose approach allocates the numerologies to the available bands considering the INI and decreases the need for guards.",

Each numerology can serve multiple synchronous user equipments (UEs). The numerologies, which have different subcarrier spacing, power level, and use case (i.e. service requirements), perform a transmitter windowing operation to reduce their OOBE level and manage interference to the numerologies operating in adjacent bands. The guard duration that is allocated for the time-dispersive channel (i.e., TCP-Ch) is fixed, and it is adequate to deal with the inter-symbol interference (ISI). Also, an extra guard duration is needed for windowing operation. Various windowing functions have been compared thoroughly in previous works, with different trade-offs between the main lobe width and the side lobe suppression. The optimal windowing function is outside the scope of the invention, and a raised-cosine (RC) window is utilized due to its low computational complexity and widespread use in the literature. The RC window function is formulated by the following equation:",

As \u03b1 increases, the OOBE decreases with the cost of increased redundancy. The transmitter windowing operation is shown in FIG. 2. Initially, the cyclic prefix (CP) 200 that is designated to handle ISI (Inter Symbol Interference) is extended on both edges of the OFDM symbol 205, and afterwards, the extended part from the beginning of the symbol 210 is added to the end.

These optimal pairs are summarized in Table II, along with the related parameters for various \u0394f. The results reveal that the need for windowing diminishes as \u03b8 decreases, and accordingly, the desired interference level can be accomplished with only a few guard carriers. Also, the spectral efficiency increases with the decrease in \u03b8. The change in required guards clearly confirms that the adaptive guard design enhances the spectral efficiency significantly compared to designing the mixed numerology system considering the worst case scenario (e.g., \u03b7\u03b8=45 dB=85.98% whereas \u03b7\u03b8=20 dB=92.53%).",

The optimization results show that the spectral efficiency (\u03b7) decreases as \u03b8 increases. For example, the numerologies with larger subcarrier spacing (\u0394f) require more guards, and they lead to lower \u03b7 values in a mixed numerology network. Since \u03b8 depends on the numerologies operating in the adjacent bands, the potential of adaptive guards can be enhanced further along with the utilization of an interference-based scheduling algorithm.",

The steps of the proposed scheduling method include: (1) Sort the numerologies regarding their subcarrier spacing (\u0394f) value in an ascending/descending order, (2) Calculate the similarity metric for all numerologies as \u03b2j=SIRj\u2212Pj, (3) Sort \u03b2 in an ascending/descending order for the numerologies with the same subcarrier spacing (\u0394f), (4) If \u03b2 value repeats, sort based on power in the adjacent band, and (5) Check P on both side of the available band.

In the first method, a random scheduling strategy is implemented (as shown in FIG. 4), whereas the interference based scheduling strategy of the present invention implemented in the second method, as shown in FIG. 9. As shown in FIG. 9, first the numerologies are sorted in descending order based upon their subcarrier spacing (\u0394f).

Additionally, within the URLLC grouping, NUM-7 900 is placed before NUM-4 905 because similarity metric is larger for NUM-7 900 than for NUM-4 905. A similar process is following with the eMBB grouping to performed the interference-based scheduling in accordance with the present invention.",

In this embodiment, the guards are allocated assuming the worst case scenario (i.e., highest \u03b8\u0394f) in the fixed assignment strategy.",

                        "The results in Table V demonstrate that the GD and GB amounts are reduced by 43% and 34%, respectively when the fixed guards are changed with the adaptive guards in the frequency range-1 (FR1) case. Also, the GD and GB amounts are reduced further by 10% and 27%, respectively when the random scheduling strategy is replaced by the interference-based scheduling strategy of the present invention. It is worth noting that spectral efficiency (\u03b7) is lower in the frequency range-2 (FR2) case since more guards are required for the numerologies with higher \u0394f values. Although, it can be compensated for with an increased number of subcarriers (FR2 is suitable for wider bands), it is kept as fixed for a fair comparison with the FR1 case in the numerical evaluations.",
                        "The present invention provides a system and method for adaptive guard utilization combined with a multi-window operation that is proposed to solve the INI problem that exists in a mixed numerology communication system. In embodiments of the invention, the guards in both time and frequency domains are jointly optimized considering the numerology, use case (i.e., service requirement), and power offset between the numerologies. Moreover, the potential of adaptive guards is further increased with an interference-based scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach arranges the numerologies in such a way that the need for guards in the available spectrum decreases. The interference-based scheduling strategy is particularly important when there is a serious power imbalance between the numerologies. The current mobile networks adopted a power control mechanism to manage interference between neighboring bands. However, this solution restricts the UEs with better channel conditions to deploy higher order modulations. The proposed adaptive guard utilization may lead to relax the power control mechanism and improve the throughput.",
                        "The results show that the precise design that accommodates such flexibility reduces the guards significantly and improves the spectral efficiency of mixed numerology systems. Despite the fact that the computational complexity increases compared to traditional OFDM-based systems, the computation of the optimal GB-GD pairs is an offline action requiring a onetime calculation. Therefore, a lookup table procedure can be used to decrease complexity. Additionally, the proposed guard utilization is application to other pulse-shaped OFDM systems.",
