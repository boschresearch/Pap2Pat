## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce methods and materials for assessing immune system profiles
- describe performing flow cytometry to determine leukocyte subsets in circulation
- generate information about leukocyte subsets and include in a database
- apply clustering algorithms to database information
- normalize information within the database
- identify individuals with similar immune profiles
- describe expected immune system response based on immune profile
- define healthy immune system profile
- define immune system profile 1
- define immune system profile 2
- define immune system profile 3
- define immune system profile 4
- define immune system profile 5
- determine immune system profile by ratio of cell counts
- describe methods for determining cell counts using flow cytometry
- associate immune system profile with medical outcome
- describe methods for treating mammals based on immune system profile

### EXAMPLES

- collect patient and healthy volunteer samples
- perform flow cytometry of whole blood
- identify immune markers
- normalize immune marker values
- perform hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis
- identify immune profiles within diseases
- analyze glioblastoma patients
- analyze non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients
- analyze renal cell carcinoma patients
- analyze ovarian cancer patients
- analyze acute lung injury patients
- identify distinct immune profiles across diseases
- combine all healthy volunteers and patients for analysis
- identify five major immune profiles
- compare immune profiles to healthy volunteers
- analyze immune profiles for correlation with patient outcome
- identify related immune markers using hierarchical clustering
- analyze CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg monocyte cell counts
- identify the CD4+/CD14+HLA-DRlo/neg ratio as a prognostic biomarker
- describe the comprehensive analysis of peripheral blood immunity
- outline the technical approach and its applications
