                        "FIG. 1 describes the basic architecture of the solution herein proposed. In particular, the connection to the power grid may be simple, in the case of single-phase utilities, or more complex, in the case of three-phase utilities.",
                        "A power meter 100 (hereinafter also indicated as Smart Meter) in particular is connected 5 to a domestic utility UD and exchanges information with a two-way communication 10 with the power grid RE. It may be achieved in single-phase and three-phase version.",
                        "The invention consists of a new conception of the electronic power meter.",
                        "In particular, with reference to FIG. 2, a first Smart Meter power meter 100a dialogs in real time with all the other Smart Meters 100 connected on a same distribution line which branches off from a MV/LV conversion station indicated in the drawing by numeral 20.",
                        "This exchange of information occurs in an entirely autonomous and transparent manner with respect to user UD connected to the Smart Meter 100.",
                        "The multiple and comprehensive interconnections 15 between the Smart Meter nodes 100 of network Net result in the information on the energy status of network Net (production and consumption) being available in each Smart Meter node 100 of the network at all times.",
                        "In particular, network Net is created so that each individual Smart Meter node 100 directly communicates with at least three other Smart Meter nodes 100, as shown in FIG. 2.",
                        "Naturally, the connections with the remaining Smart Meter nodes 100 occur with indirect connections and the passage (hop) through other Smart Meter nodes 100.",
                        "The information on the energy status of the network Net (production and consumption) is therefore instantaneously available to the power grid operator GRE by querying a single Smart Meter 100 present in network Net.",
                        "This shared information on the energy status of network Net is to be used to implement specific control practices, obviously in addition to the regular charging services used by the power grid operator GRE.",
                        "The capillary structure of the connections 15 between the Smart Meters 100 thus conceived makes it very easy for the power grid operator GRE to recover the status of network Net even in the presence of local or distributed breakdowns.",
                        "Therefore, there is an optimal fault-tolerance of network Net by virtue of the several connections 15 between the various Smart Meters 100. In particular, network Net is built so as to have a redundancy in the connections 15 so that each individual Smart Meter node 100 can be reached by a plurality of other Smart Meters 100.",
                        "The communications between the Smart Meters 100 occur through the standard G3, PRIME or Meters-and-More protocols on (conveyed wave) powerlines, i.e. already regulated worldwide contexts. The flexibility of the choice of the communication protocol makes the Smart Meter 100 usable practically in all the national and international contexts in which the communication protocols used by the operators are among those indicated above.",
                        "The Smart Meter 100 of the present invention has local connectivity according to wireless protocols, for example, but not limited to, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, or wired protocols, for example, but not limited to, Ethernet, MODBUS, CANBUS.",
                        "The local connectivity allows the redundancy in the connectivity, innovative charging management methods (on-demand payments), interfacing with domestic consumption monitoring systems (smart plugs) and the energy profiling of the domestic utilities UD.",
                        "The wireless connectivity allows querying additional meter devices, such as, for example gas and water meters.",
                        "The aim of the solution herein described is a technological hub for managing all the domestic utilities UD which, due to the features thereof, are not suitable to remote management in areas in which the telephone signal coverage is not sufficient to use telecommunication systems based on the GSM paradigm.",
                        "With reference to FIG. 3, each Smart Meter 100 comprises an information processing system 101, a memory 102, a metrology section 103, a PLC line driver 104, a power supply system 105, a display 106, one or more wired network interfaces 107, and one or more wireless network interfaces 108.",
                        "The existing prior art known by the inventors does not highlight anything similar, in that to date no Smart Meter exists which, by interacting with other Smart Power Meters, is capable of independently dialoging with the other meters to distribute the knowledge on the consumption status of the entire network and to establish an exchange of information aiming to optimize and improve the quality of the power supplies.",
                        "The electronic power metering devices in the prior art sample the power at high temporal resolution to obtain instantaneous voltage V and current I values and to store the various quantities of power in order to transmit this information to the power distribution grid operator at regular time ranges. Thereby, a given volume of data is exchanged between the various electronic power metering devices and a central processor located in the power distribution grid.",
                        "The device of the present invention resolves all the primary power metering functions through the metrology section 103. The sampling of the voltage and current (or of the voltages and currents in the case of three-phase utility) and the assessment of the power are carried in the metrology section 103 through integration algorithms of the electrical power metered. Such an operation may be carried out over any time range according to the legislative needs and to those of the power grid operator GRE.",
                        "The Smart Meter device 100 according to the invention has the same analog inputs as a conventional electronic meter; it operates in real and continuous time.",
                        "In addition to the algorithms already programed in the firmware for implementing the metering function, the Smart Meter device 100 according to the present invention has an autonomous algorithm for building an ad-hoc network connection, without operations by controller nodes upon the installation of the first Smart Meter on the network.",
                        "The Smart Meter device 100 according to the present invention is schematized with a block diagram in FIG. 4 showing a Smart Meter power device (SME) 100 and the modules therein.",
                        "In particular, FIG. 4 shows the power grid RE which is the source of a power signal to be metered.",
                        "A digital measuring circuit module CDM, i.e. the metrology section 103, is comprised in the Smart Meter device 100, comprising a System-On-Chip SOC integrated with onboard microprocessor and the devices 105 adapted to supply the Smart Meter device 100.",
                        "The System-On-Chip SOC has a PLC powerline communications unit therein for transmitting data to the operator of the power distribution grid REDi, thus complying with the various transmission standards according to the common standard G3, PRIME, Meters-and-More protocols.",
                        "The System-On-Chip SOC has a dedicated metrology circuit 103 therein, with sensors SVI for detecting voltages V and currents I on the various phases, a memory device DM 102 for storing data on the consumption and/or production and/or storage dynamics, and a user interface IU 106, which usually is, for example an LCD screen.",
                        "Moreover, the Smart Meter device 100 has different local connectivity interfaces.",
                        "The main innovative features of the Smart Meter 100 are enclosed in the microcode (firmware) which is stored in the microcontroller.",
                        "The microcode is developed according to the paradigms of the real time operating systems RTOS. The microcode simultaneously carries out the functions of metrology, information transmission, data storage, peripheral management. Each of these operations (threads) is carried out in a concurrent manner without interrupting the others.",
                        "For obvious safety and consumption data anti-counterfeiting reasons, the energy metering thread lies in a location of the memory DM 102 which is not accessible and is protected in an encrypted manner.",
                        "The PLC communication thread manages the data flow to be routed towards the grid operator GRE (outgoing charging data, incoming data such as, for example firmware upgrades or set disconnections) and also the communication network between the various Smart Meters 100.",
                        "The main thread manages all the I/O peripherals on the Smart Meter 100. It configures the wired 107 and wireless 108 transmission interfaces and interacts with the other peripherals such as smart plugs and other Smart Meters 100 for domestic services such as water and gas.",
                        "In addition to the threads already described, an independent thread manages the creation of network Net between the plurality of Smart Meters 100 using a low-cost computational authentication procedure based on PUFs (Physically Unclonable Functions).",
                        "Network Net elects a super-node therein, selected according to the latency times, which it communicates with the concentrator. In the absence of this super-node, it automatically goes to the second elected.",
                        "Network Net is built during the installation of the Smart Meters in the individual utilities. The first Smart Meter 100 dialogs with a network controller, conventionally resident in the MV/LV station, and is authenticated by the PUF (Physically Unclonable Functions) algorithm.",
                        "Each Smart Meter which is then connected to the same power distribution line will be authenticated in the same manner and will receive the updated table of the network addresses of the other Smart Meters 100 already connected.",
                        "At the end of the authentication procedure, or possibly upon the installation of a new Smart Meter 100, network Net is complete and the identifier address table is available and updated on each Smart Meter 100.",
                        "At this point, the Smart Meters 100 begin exchanging the information with one another, populating the table while associating the consumption data thereof with the addresses of the other Smart Meters 100.",
                        "Network Net thus created is capable of electing a coordinator node by means of election algorithms based on the latency time. At the end of the election procedures, there will be a classification of the nodes whereby, even if the individual elected node were to lose visibility, it would be immediately replaced by the second node in the classification.",
                        "The super-node thus identified dialogs directly with the controller node, sending it the table with the consumption data of the entire network Net.",
                        "A further thread implemented in the microcode assesses the energy spectrum of the power by means of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in order to characterize the different electric loads connected to the Smart Meter 100.",
