                        "Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an inflammatory autoimmune skin disease with heterogenic subtypes varying from localized discoid plaques to severe and widespread erythrosquamous lesions in affected patients (see e.g., Kuhn & Landmann, J. Autoimmun. 2014, 48-49:14-19). The disease is characterized by a typical histological pattern called \u201cinterface dermatitis\u201d (ID) consisting of colloid bodies and an anti-epidermal cytotoxic lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermoepidermal junction which is orchestrated by IFN-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (see e.g., Wenzel & T\u00fcting, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2008, 128:2392-2402; and Wenzel et al, Br. J. Dermatol. 2007, 157:752-757).",
                        "CLE is of multifactorial origin; including both genetic and environmental risk factors (see e.g., Kunz et al, Exp. Dermatol. 2015, 24:510-515; Sinha & Dey-Rao, J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc., 2017, 18:S75-S80; and Szczech et al, Lupus, 2017, 26:791-807). In particular UV radiation promotes cellular damage, apoptosis and release of DNA-containing blebs. It is considered that cell debris clearance is impaired entailing secondary necrosis (see e.g., Kuhn et al, Arthritis Rheum. 2006, 54:939-950; Caricchio et al, The Journal of Immunology 2003, 171:5778-5786; and Mahajan et al, Front Immunol. 2016, 7). In some cases such as familial chilblain lupus the underlying cause can be TREX1 gene mutations leading to a dysfunctional TREX1 exonuclease and high accumulation of cytosolic DNA (see e.g., G\u00fcnther et al, J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2013, 69:e179-81; Grieves et al, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 2015, 112:5117-5122; G\u00fcnther et al, Dermatology (Basel), 2009, 219:162-166; and Peschke et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2014, 134:1456-1459).",
                        "When nuclear components, such as endogenous nucleic acid motifs, are released out of the nucleus due to cellular damage, they can be perceived as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (see e.g., Scholtissek et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2017, 137:1484-1492). There is evidence that keratinocytes and particularly plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) react on DAMPs inappropriately with immense type I IFN production through TLR-dependent or TLR-independent pathways in CLE (see e.g., Mustelin et al, Front. Immunol. 2019, 10:238; Wollenberg et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002, 119:1096-1102; Wenzel et al, Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2009, 301:83-86; Yu et al, J. Autoimmun. 2013, 41:34-45; and Katayama et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. DOI: 10.1016/j.jid.2019.02.035). Undergoing an autocrine loop IFNs bind to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptors on keratinocytes, thus activating JAK/STAT pathway and expression of proinflammatory mediators such as CXCL10. It is known that CXCL10 recruits CXCR3+ effector cells and pDCs into skin lesions (see e.g., Wenzel et al, Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2009, 301:83-86; and Wenzel et al, J. Pathol. 2005, 205:435-442). Those effector cells induce keratinocytic necroptosis (see e.g., Lauffer et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2018, 138:1785-1794), cytokine release and a continuous \u201cself-recruitment\u201d as a hallmark of chronic inflammation (see e.g., Meller et al, Arthritis Rheum. 2005, 52:1504-1516).",
                        "This circle can result in a strong burden for quality of life (see e.g., Samotij et al, Postepy Dermatol. Alergol. 2018, 35:192-198; and Ogunsanya et al, Int. J. Womens Dermatol. 2018, 4:152-158). Following current guidelines, corticosteroids and antimalarials are established as first-line treatment of CLE. However, corticosteroids are limited by side effects and long-term treatment, particularly in antimalarial-resistant patients, can be challenging. In addition, no specifically approved drugs exist for CLE and only a few clinical trials have been conducted, not least because of clinical heterogeneity and thus challenging trial design (see e.g., Chen et al, F1000Res. 2019, 8).",
                        "The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has established a scheme of eleven clinical and lab criteria for the purpose of distinguishing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) from other autoimmune diseases. The ACR guidelines require four of eleven criteria to be met for a diagnosis of SLE, however, only four of the criteria are cutaneous in nature (malar rash, discoid lesions, mucosal ulcers, and photosensitivity) and therefore involvement of skin pathologies is not obligatory for the diagnosis of SLE. Conversely, cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) subtypes can occur in the absence of systemic disease (SLE); CLE is two to three times more frequent than SLE (see e.g., Tebbe & Orfanos, Lupus, 1997, 6(2):96-104).",

In some embodiments, the disease is cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). In some embodiments, the cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is selected from acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. In some embodiments, the cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. In some embodiments, the cutaneous lupus erythematosus is selected from subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE).

                        "As used herein, \u201ccutaneous lupus\u201d refers to a form of the disease in which symptoms are restricted to those that affect the skin. For example, a patient may be diagnosed with cutaneous lupus, but that does not mean that he or she has SLE, which affects multiple parts of the body. Similarly, if a patient has SLE, it does not mean that he or she will necessarily have cutaneous lupus. Accordingly the Cutaneous Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI) scoring system was devised, which quantitatively measures disease activity and damage (see e.g., Albrecht et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005, November; 125(5):889-94). This index, which accounts for lesional morphology as well as anatomic location, has since been validated by reliability testing for both dermatologists and rheumatologists.",
                        "Cutaneous lupus is divided into several subtypes, including acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Acute cutaneous LE typically presents in the third decade of life and is frequently associated with active SLE. The most typical form of acute cutaneous lupus is a malar rash-flattened areas of red skin on the face that resemble a sunburn (see e.g., Fabbri et al., Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2003, 4(7):449-65). These lesions are typically transient, sun-induced, and non-scarring. Malar rashes have been reported to be present in \u02dc50% of SLE patients at the time of diagnosis, with clinical activity of the rash paralleling that of the systemic disease (see e.g., Rothfield et al., Clin. Dermatol.; 2006, September-October; 24(5):348-62).",
                        "Chronic cutaneous lupus includes discoid LE (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CHLE), and LE tumidus (LET). In some embodiments, the chronic cutaneous lupus is selected from discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), lupus erythematosus profundus (LEP), chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE), and lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET).",
                        "Discoid LE lesions are the most common lesions of Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE) and appear as disk-shaped, round lesions. DLE occurs more frequently in women in their fourth and fifth decade of life. Patients with DLE generally have a more benign disease course as compared to patients with other CLE subtypes, with only most patients (\u02dc90-95%) never develop lupus in other organ systems (SLE) symptoms (see e.g., Crowson & Magro, J. Cutan. Pathol. 2001, 28(1):1-23; and Chong et al., Br. J. Dermatol. 2012, 166(1):29-35). The sores usually appear on the scalp and face but sometimes they will occur on other parts of the body as well. Discoid lupus lesions are often red, scaly, and thick. Usually, the lesions do not hurt or itch. Histologic examination of active DLE lesion reveals hyperkeratosis, dilated compact keratin-filled follicles, vacuolar degeneration of the basal keratinocytes, and an intensely inflammatory dermal infiltrate.",
                        "LE profundus (LEP), or panniculitis, features painful firm subcutaneous nodules occurring in areas of increased fat deposition, such as the upper arms and legs, face, and breasts. LEP tends to have a chronic course, characterized by remission and flares, and ultimately leaving atrophic scars (see e.g., Fabbri et al., Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2003, 4(7):449-65). Histology shows lobular panniculitis with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate.",
                        "Chilblain lupus (CHLE) is a rare form of CCLE resembling frostbite. Lesions appear as painful, violaceous plaques and nodules in cold-exposed areas. Central erosions or ulcerations may occur on acral surfaces, such as fingers, toes, heels, nose, and ears. Chilblain lupus occurs when there is a temperature drop, and can be difficult to distinguish from frostbite. Pathology shows epidermal atrophy, interface vacuolization, and a perivascular mononuclear infiltrate. Approximately 80% of patients with CHLE will not develop SLE (see e.g., Hedrich et al., Clin. Rheumatol. 2008, 27(8):949-54).",
                        "Lupus tumidus is a subtype of CCLE characterized by extreme photosensitivity and a benign course occurring preferentially in men, unlike SLE which primarily occurs in women. Clinically, these lesions appear on the face as erythematous, edematous, urticaria-like polycylic plaques with sharp raised borders and smooth surfaces.",
                        "Primarily in young to middle aged women, subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) lesions are described as having a scaly red annular (\u201cring-like\u201d) redness with central clearing. The lesions may also be polycyclic\u2014that is, having the appearance of multiple rings coming together. There are two morphologic variants of SCLE: annular and papulosquamous. The annular variant is characterized by scaly annular erythematous plaques, which tend to coalesce and produce a polycyclic array (see e.g., Walling & Sontheimer, Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2009, 10(6):365-81). The papulosquamous variant can resemble eczema, as well as pityriasis in some instances (see e.g., Caproni et al. Int. J. Dermatol. 2001, 40(1):59-62). SCLE lesions occur in sun-exposed areas, including the upper thorax (\u2018V\u2019 distribution), upper back, and the extensor surfaces of arms and forearms. About 10% of SLE patients will have SCLE lesions and those patients with systemic disease tend to have only mild symptoms in other organ compartments. Pathologic examination of SCLE lesions demonstrates hydropic degeneration of the basal keratinocytes, dermal edema, hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, and a sparse superficial inflammatory infiltrate (see e.g., Fabbri et al., Am. J. Clin. Dermatol. 2003, 4(7):449-65).",
                        "First evidence for a functional role of type I IFNs in lupus erythematosus (i.e., LE) came from clinical observations in patients suffering from carcinoid tumors which were treated with recombinant IFN\u03b1 and developed SLE due to this therapy (see e.g., Ronnblom et al, Acta Oncol. 1991, 30:537-540). This was supported by findings in multiple sclerosis patients who developed CLE-like lesions at the injection side of recombinant IFN\u03b2 after subcutaneous application (see e.g., Arrue et al, J. Cutan. Pathol. 2007, 34, Suppl 1:18-21). Gene expression analyses in both SLE and CLE revealed a strong expression of type I IFN associated proinflammatory cytokines in blood and skin in association with disease activity (see e.g., Kuhn et al, Semin. Immunopathol. 2016, 38:97-112; and Mikita et al, J. Dermatol. 2011, 38:839-849). These findings are supported by the data described herein, which demonstrates a strong expression of IFN-regulated genes and immune pathways within CLE skin lesions (see e.g., FIGS. 1A-1D).",
                        "Previous reports describing strong IFN-signatures prompted the development of anti-IFN directed therapeutic strategies of LE patients. Anti-IFN\u03b1-agents (e.g., sifalimumab, rontalizumab) were the first drugs tested in clinical studies. These agents reduced the IFN signature in the blood but had limited effect on disease activity. Without being bound by theory, this was possibly due to the high variability of the different type I IFNs, including not only IFN\u03b1 but also IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03ba binding to the same receptors (see e.g., Kalunian et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2016, 75:196-202; Merrill et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2011, 70:1905-1913; and Sarkar et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2018, 77:1653-1664). Accordingly, targeting the common receptor was more effective: the anti-IFN\u03b1\u03b2-receptor antibody anifrolumab significantly reduced the CLASI skin score in SLE patients in a recent clinical study (see e.g., Furie et al, Arthritis & Rheumatology, 2017, 69:376-386). Alternative strategies focused on \u201cindirect\u201d inhibition of the IFN system by (i) targeting the IFN-producing cells or (ii) the intracellular IFN-pathway. In skin and blood plasmacytoid DCs are regarded as the main IFN-producing cells (see e.g., Saadeh et al, Exp. Dermatol. 2016, 25:415-421) and the pDC-specific antibodies BIIB059 and VIB7734 are now in clinical trials with first results indicating a decline of the CLASI-activity score (see e.g., Furie et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2017, 76 (Suppl 2):857).",
                        "The JAK family consists of four non-receptor tyrosine kinases (JAK1-3, TYK2) that transduce signals from growth factors and cytokines such as type I/III IFNs. JAK inhibitors were initially developed for the treatment of haematologic diseases with definite JAK-mutations showing anticlonal activity (see e.g., Morgan et al, Annu. Rev. Med. 2008, 59:213-222; and Pardanani et al, Leukemia 2008, 22:23-30), but they also provide significant immunosuppressive effects (see e.g., Santos & Verstovsek, Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2014, 15:1465-1473; Schwartz et al, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017, 16:843-862; Schwartz et al, Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2016, 12:25-36; and Howell et al, Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2018, 120:367-375).",
                        "Earlier studies revealed activation of JAK/STAT pathway and JAK protein expression in CLE and associated skin disorders (see e.g., Scholtissek et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2017, 137:1484-1492; Alves de Medeiros et al, PLoS ONE 2016, 11:e0164080; and Wenzel et al, J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2008, 58:437-442)). JAK inhibitors provided beneficial effects in interface dermatitides including graft-versus-host disease (see e.g., Spoerl et al, Blood, 2014, 123:3832-3842), dermatomyositis (see e.g., Hornung et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 2014, 371:2537-2538; and Hornung et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 2015, 372:1274) and LE (see e.g., Wenzel et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2016, 136:1281-1283; and Briand et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2019, 78:431-433) in addition to other inflammatory skin conditions (see e.g., Baneree et al, Drugs, 2017, 77:521-546; Welsch et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 2017, 47:1096-1107; and Shreberk-Hassidim et al, J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 2017, 76:745-753.e19). In CLE, JAK1/2 inhibitors ruxolitinib (see e.g., Wenzel et al, J. Invest. Dermatol. 2016, 136:1281-1283; Briand et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2019, 78:431-433; and Klaeschen et al, Exp. Dermatol. 2017, 26:728-730) and baricitinib (see e.g., Zimmerman et al, JAMA Dermatol. DOI: 10.1001jamadermatol.2018.5077) as well as JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib (see e.g., Konig et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2017, 76:468-472) have been reported to be successful in patient's treatment, and these drugs significantly decrease the expression of CLE-typical chemokines in vitro (see e.g., Klaeschen et al, Exp. Dermatol. 2017, 26:728-730; and Srivastava et al, Acta. Derm. Venereol. 2018, 98:772-775). One potential disadvantage of these drugs are side effects, including anemia and thrombopenia, which may occur in some patients. The side effects are associated with JAK2 and JAK3 inhibition.",
                        "Notably, recent reports of a double-blind placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of SLE suggest that baricitinib was not effective compared to placebo (see e.g., Wallace et al, Lancet, 2018, 392(10143):222-231; and Werth & Merrill, Br. J. Dermatol. 2019, 180(5):964-965). Baricitinib (2 mg or 4 mg) was dosed once daily for 24 weeks. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and had active disease involving skin or joints. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving resolution of arthritis or rash at week 24, as defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K).",
                        "In an exploratory end point, the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) was evaluated, finding no improvement on the CLASI activity score with baricitinib. Unlike SLEDAI, the CLASI scoring system has been fully validated as a cutaneous-specific end point for SLE and successfully used in a number of phase II clinical trials for SLE and CLE. Recent reports also agree that the CLASI scoring system should be used as the skin outcome for lupus trials examining responsiveness in the skin (see e.g., Albrecht J, et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 125:889-94; Klein et al., Arch.

For example, some of the compounds described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, preferentially inhibit JAK1 over one or more of JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. JAK1 plays a central role in a number of cytokine and growth factor signaling pathways that, when dysregulated, can result in or contribute to disease states. For example, IL-6 levels are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which it has been suggested to have detrimental effects (see e.g., Fonesca, et al., Autoimmunity Reviews, 8:538-42, 2009). Because IL-6 signals, at least in part, through JAK1, IL-6 can be indirectly through JAK1 inhibition, resulting in potential clinical benefit (see e.g., Guschin, et al. Embo J 14:1421, 1995; and Smolen, et al. Lancet 371:987, 2008). In other autoimmune diseases and cancers, elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines that activate JAK1 may also contribute to the disease and/or associated symptoms. Therefore, patients with such diseases may benefit from JAK1 inhibition. Selective inhibitors of JAK1 may be efficacious while avoiding unnecessary and potentially undesirable effects of inhibiting other JAK kinases, as described herein.",

Preferably, the compositions comprise from about 1 mg to about 50 mg or about 1 mg to about 10 mg of active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies compounds or compositions containing about 1 mg to about 10 mg, about 1 mg to about 20 mg, about 1 mg to about 25 mg, about 1 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient.",
                                "The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.",
                                "For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present application. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present application (e.g. a JAK1 inhibitor provided herein).",
                                "The tablets or pills of the present application can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.",
                                "The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present application can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.",
                                "Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.",
                                "Topical (e.g., intradermal) administration provides the advantage of treating the skin disorder locally, minimizing potential adverse events associated with systemic exposure, and allowing an easier discontinuation of the therapy, if necessary. Additionally, some topical dosage forms such as creams, ointments, and gels have the benefit of excipients that may act as emollients or occlusive agents, which can increase patient well-being and compliance during the treatment period. Other dosage routes such as oral, parenteral, and inhalation may lead to supratherapeutic systemic drug levels, increased likelihood of adverse events, drug-drug interactions, and generation of active/toxic metabolites, which may result in treatment discontinuation and inadequate patient compliance.",
                                "Topical formulations intended for dermal delivery are typically solutions, suspensions, gels, creams, ointments, lotions, sprays, and foams and can contain one or more conventional carriers as described herein. The formulation composition should be prepared with the goal of delivering the active ingredient to the appropriate layer(s) of the skin, minimizing systemic exposure, and preventing skin irritation. Additionally the pharmaceutical composition should be physically and chemically stable. Depending on the selected dosage form, one or more additional excipients as described herein may be necessary, e.g., pH adjusting agents, chelating agents, preservatives, co-solvents, penetration enhancers, humectants, thickening, gelling, viscosity building agents, surfactants, propellants, fragrances, colorants, or any combination or mixture thereof.",
                                "In some embodiments, topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers as described herein. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, for example, liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white petrolatum, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g. glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, for example, glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, for example, 100 g, which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).",
                                "The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.",
                                "The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.",
                                "The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present application can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 \u03bcg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.",

The catalytic domains of human JAK1 (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) and JAK3 (a.a. 781-1124) with an N-terminal His tag are expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50 s of compounds are measured for each kinase in the 40 \u03bcL reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. For the 1 mM IC50 measurements, ATP concentration in the reactions is 1 mM. Reactions are carried out at room temperature for 1 hour and then stopped with 20 \u03bcL 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody takes place for 40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a Fusion plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.). The compounds in Table 1 were tested in this assay and shown to have the IC50 values in Table 1."

                                "To investigate the efficacy of pharmacological JAK1 inhibition, in vitro analyses in three different CLE-models were performed (i) NHEK-cells, (ii) HaCaT-cells and (iii) 3D epidermis equivalents. As shown in FIG. 2C, pharmacological JAK1 inhibition induced a significant downregulation of genes encoding key drivers of innate inflammatory pathways such as IFN-regulated chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL11), cell death (TRAIL, AIM2, TREX1) and cross-talk to adaptive immune cells (BlyS) within primary keratinocytes (NHEK) compared to untreated eNA-inflamed cells. Associated downregulated KEGG pathways are listed in Table A. These results were confirmed in HaCaT-cells, where both JAK1- and JAK1/2 inhibitors decreased the protein expression of CXCL10 significantly.",
                                "The in vitro data disclosed herein demonstrates that JAK1 selective inhibitors are as potent as JAK1/2 inhibitors in suppression of CLE typical cytokines, as shown in FIG. 2D, and prohibit gene expression encoding proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL10-11), lymphocyte activators (BLyS) (see e.g., Wenzel et al, Exp. Dermatol. 2018, 27:95-97) and cell death promotors (TRAIL (see e.g., Zahn et al, Br. J. Dermatol. 2011, 165:1118-1123), AIM2, Caspase 10, TREX1). Interestingly, inhibition ofJAK3 did not obtain a reduction of CXCL10 expression, as shown in FIG. 2D, which is a central mediator of CLE-typical \u201cinterface dermatitis\u201d. Without being bound by theory, this could explain the earlier failure of the JAK3/SYK blocking agent R333 in a clinical CLE study (see e.g., Presto et al, Br. J. Dermatol. 2018, 178:1308-1314). In 3D epidermis equivalents, exposure of a JAK1 selective inhibitor to stimulated epiCS revealed a significantly reduced CXCL10 protein expression, consistent to findings described above, as shown in FIG. 2E."
