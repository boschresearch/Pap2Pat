    "title": "Probing the molecular design of hyper-branched aryl polyesters towards lubricant applications",
    "date": "2016-01-05",
    "abstract": "We report novel polymeric materials that may be used as viscosity index improvers (VII) for lubricant applications. Our efforts included probing the comb-burst hyper-branched aryl polyester architecture for beneficial viscosity and friction behavior when utilized as an additive in a group I oil. The monomer was designed as to undergo polymerization via polycondensation within the architectural construct (AB2), typical of hyperbranched polymers. The monomer design was comprised of aliphatic arms (12 or 16 methylenes) to provide the necessary lipophilicity to achieve solubility in a non-polar medium. Once polymerized, via catalyst and heat, the surface alcohols were functionalized with fatty acids (lauric and palmitic). Controlling the aliphatic nature of the internal arms and peripheral end-groups provided four unique flexible polymer designs. Changing the reaction time and concentration provided opportunities to investigate the influence of molecular weight and branching density on oil-solubility, viscosity, and friction. Oil-solubility was found to decrease with fewer internal carbons, but the number of internal carbons appears to have little influence on the bulk solution viscosity. At concentrations of 2 wt % in a group I base oil, these polymer additives demonstrated an improved viscosity index and reduced friction coefficient, validating the basic approach.",

                        "We targeted four derivatives of hyper-branched aryl polyesters (HAPe). This included variation of the lipophilic linkage of the monomer by six or eight carbons and the modification of the subsequent polymer with long chain acyl chlorides (dodecanoyl chloride, C12, or palmitoyl chloride, C16), to afford saturated fatty esters in the corona (Fig. 2). The three-step synthesis included a quantitative preparation of the monomer20, a gravimetric yield greater than 50% of the alcohol-functionalized polymerization product, followed by a variable yield (49% to quantitative) post-functionalization of the peripheral alcohols into fatty esters21. Over-polymerization (leading to an insoluble gel) occurred quite readily with our monomer while utilizing the procedure described by Hawker and co-workers towards their polyethylene glycol (PEG) analog19. To mitigate the over-polymerization of our analog, as well as reduce the average degree of branching, the monomer was diluted in dichlorbenzene (DCB). Thus a 1.0\u2009M solution of the monomer was heated near reflux and treated with a tin catalyst (n-Bu2SnOAc2) to initiate polymerization. Although more controllable than the neat polymerization, the solution polymerization was not free of challenges, as to prevent over-polymerization. The polymerization had to be monitored closely by 1H NMR to prevent the formation of an insoluble resin which appeared to occur with relatively high average degree of polymerizations (). The stacked 1H NMR spectra inset in Fig. 2 illustrates the typical progression of these step-growth polymerizations over 6\u2009hours, which was generally the time required to achieve a soluble polymer. The broadening and slow disappearance of the methyl ester peak at 3.88\u2009ppm (green) was closely monitored and utilized in conjunction with the ether methylene peak at 3.95\u2009ppm (blue) to target s between 10 and 30. As is the case with step-growth polymerizations, the relationship of the conversion of the monomer into polymer with molecular weight is non-linear. Therefore, the determination of  via an aliquot removed from the reaction mixture and measured by 1H NMR did not provide accurate insight into the progression of the polymerization in regards to molecular weight. To determine number-average molecular weight (n) via 1H NMR spectroscopy, analogs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were first purified by precipitation. Polymerizations 5, 6, and 7 were terminated by simply adding the next step reagents, i.e. palmitoyl chloride (C16) and triethyl amine (TEA). Analogs 1, 2, 3, and 4 were subsequently treated with either dodecanoyl chloride (C12) or C16 and TEA in tetrahydrofuran (THF). All analogs were then purified via precipitation techniques prior to further characterization.",
                        "The polymers were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine n and chemical composition (i.e. percent of post-functionalization, Pf%). The ns were found to range from 3.05 to 34.5\u2009kg/mol (Table 1). The Pf% was determined to be between 49 to 99%. The apparent number-average molecular weights (napp) and molar dispersity () were determined to be between 4.75\u221218.2\u2009kg/mol and 1.55\u22123.27, respectively, by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). There are discrepancies between 1H NMR and SEC ns suggesting an error in calculating  via end group analysis or the hydrodynamic volume of polymers with comparable molar masses have significantly different architectures (linear vs. dendritic) thereby influencing the elution volume. For example, analogs 1 and 2 were determined by end group analysis to have ns approximately half of analogs 3 and 4. However, SEC suggests the reverse understanding with analogs 1 and 2 having napps greater than analogs 3 and 4. Complications in obtaining accurate molar masses from 1H NMR are due to increasing peak overlap between the broadening methylene ether (\u03b4\u2009=\u20093.95) and gradual disappearance of the methyl ester (\u03b4\u2009=\u20093.88) protons. However, the broad (\u2009<\u20093.3) and multi-modal spectra obtained from SEC also limits accurate interpretation of how the hydrodynamic volume (Vh) may be related to architectural or molecular weight differences. The elucidation of the architectural differences of these polymeric samples, by determining the average degree of branching () via NMR spectroscopy, was not possible. Similar systems consist of aromatic protons which are close to the alcohol/ester functionality in the polymer2223 and therefore respond to those respective environmental changes in the molecule. The  can rather easily be determined from integration of the phenyl protons. In our case however, all functional groups that undergo a change are six or eight carbons away from the phenyl ring, and thus the aromatic protons do not \u201csee\u201d a responsiveness to these changes. Although we are unable to confirm the branched structure by NMR analysis, the AB2 polycondensation reaction is well-known to produce hyper-branched architectures."

                        "Our primary goal was to test the performance of these polymers/oligomers as viscosity index improvers. In addition, the relatively high density of heteroatoms was expected to increase the interaction with the metal surfaces, thereby reducing friction near the boundary regime. The molecular feature that is responsible for friction reduction results in a reduced lipophilicity and therefore solubility in base oils. These blends, after long periods of agitation, formed turbid mixtures at room temperature. Additional heating (\u226550\u2009\u00b0C) was required to prepare homogeneous blends which underwent a reversible phase separation at temperatures <50\u2009\u00b0C. Although phase separation of HAPes from neat base oils <50\u2009\u00b0C is not ideal, it is expected that the miscibility would increase within a formulated package which includes various other additives that may promote solubility. The polymers were mixed in group I oil (ExxonMobil) at concentrations of 1\u22123\u2009wt % via agitation and heating. Blends of benchmarks (Bench.) 1 and 2 were prepared at the appropriate concentrations and utilized as comparative model systems due to their prevalence as viscosity modifiers within the lubricant field. In order to calculate the viscosity index of the additives, the dynamic viscosity (centipoise; cP) of the 2\u2009wt % blends was measured at 40 and 100\u2009\u00b0C utilizing a rotary spindle viscometer. Kinematic viscosity values, in centistokes (cSt\u2009=\u2009cP/\u03c1; where \u03c1\u2009=\u2009g/mL), were calculated from these numbers and are reported in Table 2 at a 2\u2009wt % concentration. Viscosity indices (VI) were generated by an online calculator widely accepted by experts in the field24. Another significant value for lubricant evaluation and the subsequent determination of the oil grade it falls in25, is a high temperature high shear test (HTHS), which imposes a low viscosity limit on the final oil3. This test is performed at 150\u2009\u00b0C which is presumed to be approaching the highest temperature and shear boundary the lubricant may experience during engine operation (ASTM DS-62).",
                        "For easy comparison of kinematic viscosity values and the respective VIs, of the benchmarks, base oil and the comb-burst analogs, the results are illustrated in the bar graph (Fig. 3). The ideal lubricant formulation would be homogeneous and undergo little viscosity change over a wide range of temperatures. Benchmark 1 and 2, in group I oil, are indeed homogeneous over a wide range of temperatures (10 to 100\u2009\u00b0C). However, benchmark 1 significantly increased the viscosity of the neat oil from 31.4\u2009cSt to 311.5\u2009cSt at 40\u2009\u00b0C. Furthermore, benchmark 1 demonstrated an undesirable increase in viscosity at 10\u2009\u00b0C (1053\u2009cSt) which may lead to problematic engine cold-starts, particularly in colder climates.",
                        "The viscosity index values reflect the overall resistance to the natural thinning tendency of lubricants and provide a unit-less number to compare one lubricant formulation to another. In general, a high viscosity index value with little effect on viscosity of the lubricant at lower temperatures is desirable. As calculated from data obtained from the spindle viscometer, the group I oil VI was 97 whereas benchmark 1 was 182 and benchmark 2 was 178 (2 and 1.67\u2009wt %, respectively). The VI of group I oil suggests a more significant change in viscosity between 40 and 100\u2009\u00b0C is observed as compared to the lubricant formulations with benchmark 1 and 2. The bar graph in Fig. 3 affords an illustrative comparison of the relationship between viscosity at 40 and 100\u2009\u00b0C and their respective calculated VI values. The bar graph clearly indicates that benchmark 1 has a greater influence on viscosity whereas benchmark 2 has less of an impact on viscosity at 40\u2009\u00b0C but still provides a comparable viscosity index value. In other words, benchmark 1 is inherently a better viscosity modifier (VM) whereas benchmark 2 is a viscosity index improver (VII). Significant towards the research described in this publication, benchmark 1 and 2 provide lubricant formulation models that encompass VM or VII behavior, which affords an opportunity to compare viscosity performance to our HAPe additives.",
                        "Lubricant formulations prepared with a 2\u2009wt % concentration of our polymeric additives, HAPe, demonstrated little influence as a VM or VII. Little to no increase in viscosity was observed at 40\u2009\u00b0C, which is desirable, while at 100\u2009\u00b0C no increase in viscosity was observed with respect to the group I oil, which is undesirable. As a result, the VIs of the HAPe lubricant formulations were below those of the benchmarks. Furthermore, there was no clear connection between molecular weight and/or architecture, and viscosity results. For example, analog 2 (n\u2009=\u20098.83\u2009kg/mol) results suggested a small increase in viscosity from the neat group I oil at 40 and 100\u2009\u00b0C (31.4\u2009\u2192\u200931.7 and 5.3\u2009\u2192\u20095.4\u2009cSt, respectively) providing a slightly elevated VI of 105. Whereas analog 4 (n\u2009=\u200917.6\u2009kg/mol) results indicate a slightly lower increase in viscosity (31.4\u2009\u2192\u200931.6 and 5.3\u2009\u2192\u20095.3\u2009cSt, respectively) and VI (101). However, the changes in viscosity and respective VIs are within standard error and therefore do not provide insight into whether the suspected architectural differences may be influencing lubricant performance or not. In any case, the HAPe additives demonstrate little influence on the bulk oil\u2019s viscosity.",
                        "Viscosity is a fluid\u2019s ability to resist shear. For practical use, oils must meet the requirements set out in SAE engine oil viscosity classification J30025. This includes low and high temperature viscometry, as well as a high shear rate requirement of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009s\u22121 at 150\u2009\u00b0C. High shear rate analysis under high temperature conditions provides insight into how a lubricant formulation may hold up in real world applications. The neat group I oil, benchmarks 1 and 2, and analog 4 viscosities were measured at 150\u2009\u00b0C and a shear rate of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009s\u22121 to probe how these lubricant formulations would perform under limiting conditions. The viscosities of group I oil (2.3\u2009cSt) and analog 4 (2.4\u2009cSt) were ca. 44% of their respective viscosities at 100\u2009\u00b0C. Benchmarks 1 (4.7\u2009cSt) and 2 (2.6\u2009cSt) demonstrated a more significant loss in viscosity under these conditions, respectively ca. 12% and 17% of their original viscosities at 100\u2009\u00b0C. Although analog 4 has very little effect as a VI improver, the viscosity under these extreme conditions is actually higher than that of the oil. In this case, we can postulate that the retention of viscosity is due to the hyper-branched topology of the analog.",
                        "Sliding friction in an engine is significantly reduced by the addition of lubricants. There are three regimes of lubrication, depending on the thickness of the lubricating film between the moving parts: boundary lubrication, mixed lubrication and hydrodynamic lubrication. In an operating engine, all three regimes occur simultaneously in different parts of the engine or under different conditions of operation (Fig. 4).",
                        "Friction coefficients (\u03bc) against speed (m/s) were measured at room temperature (~23\u2009\u00b0C) and 100\u2009\u00b0C on a variable-load journal bearing tester (VLBT), for lubricant formulations of benchmark 2 and analog 2. In Fig. 5, the friction trace of neat group I base oil was an average of two baseline tests performed before and after, each additized oil was tested.",
                        "In Fig. 5a, at 23\u2009\u00b0C, benchmark 2 appears to have no influence on the friction versus the neat oil. At 100\u2009\u00b0C, a reduction in \u03bc was observed over the entire range. The gains in reducing friction at higher temperatures may be due to the benefit of a higher viscosity of benchmark 2 (15.1\u2009cSt at 100\u2009\u00b0C) versus the neat oil (5.3\u2009cSt at 100\u2009\u00b0C). In Fig. 5b, at both 23 and 100\u2009\u00b0C, analog 2 shows a significant friction reduction in mixed and boundary lubrication at speeds <0.7\u2009m/s. The observed reduction in friction may be attributed to a layer of polymeric additive deposited on the contact surfaces. This is not observed in the case of benchmark 2, where benchmark 2 has a more favorable viscosity than analog 2 (vide infra) and therefore should have a lower friction by default. It is conceivable that a thin polymeric film is formed at the interface, which lowers the coefficient of friction. The differences in viscosity between benchmark 2 (106\u2009cSt at 23\u2009\u00b0C; 15.1\u2009cSt at 100\u2009\u00b0C) and analog 2 (67\u2009cSt at 23\u2009\u00b0C; 5.4\u2009cSt at 100\u2009\u00b0C) make it hard to compare these two formulations directly. In Fig. 5c, the friction reduction of each additized oil was calculated by subtracting its friction trace from that of the base oil. At 23\u2009\u00b0C, the more significant friction reduction in mixed and boundary lubrication regimes was produced by the lower-viscosity analog 2-additized oil compared with the benchmark 2-additized oil; at 100\u2009\u00b0C, such reduction was only observed on the transition from boundary regime to mixed regime at ~0.5\u2009m/s."

                "A comb-burst hyper-branched aryl polyester (HAPe) architecture was investigated as a lubricant additive. Four analogues were targeted with varying molecular weights and degrees of branching. The formation of an insoluble gel with polystyrene equivalent molecular weights () greater than ca. 60\u2009kDa was readily observed while utilizing a previously published protocol where relatively higher molecular weights (\u2009=\u200995\u2009kDa) for their ethylene glycol analogue was reported19. This prompted us to modify the polycondensation reaction conditions by diluting the monomer in dichlorobenzene (DCB) affording greater control over the degree of polymerization while inherently reducing the degree of branching and promoting longer reaction times. Seven of these polymerizations were reported in the previous sections and include variations in the oligomeric linkage of the B component (AB2; 12 vs. 16 methylenes per monomer), post-functionalization groups (12 vs. 16 carbons per terminal alcohol), and  (6\u221226 repeating units). We envisioned the flexible core and corona of HAPe would afford an oil-soluble additive with viscosity index improvement results due to expected conformational changes and chain entanglement while reducing friction and shear degradation due to advantages afforded by non-linear architectures and incorporation of surface-interacting functional groups.",
                "HAPes were blended homogeneously in group I oils above 50\u2009\u00b0C with sufficient agitation and demonstrated modest improvements to the VI of the unadditized base oil. We observed little influence on the viscosity of the oil with 2 wt % HAPe at 40\u2009\u00b0C (desirable). This trend was also observed at 100\u2009\u00b0C (undesirable) indicating insufficient  and chain entanglement. Due to the relationship of  to , we believe this observation was caused by the relatively low s of HAPes prepared in this study. Once again, s were limited by solubility constraints, presumably caused by either the highly dense non-lipophilic components within the core (i.e. esters and aryls) or over entanglement leading to an insoluble HAPe network. The disadvantages of relatively low s and limited solubility proved to be more advantageous for friction reduction. At both 23\u2009\u00b0C and 100\u2009\u00b0C, a 2\u2009wt % formulation of analog 2 (HAPe1\u2009+\u2009C16; cSt\u2009=\u200967; \u2009=\u200952.8\u2009kDa) in group I base oil reduced friction more effectively than benchmark 2 (cSt\u2009=\u2009106; \u2009=\u2009~200\u2009kDa), suggesting great potential for analog 2 and similar materials as multi-functional lubricant additive.",
                "Limitations in viscosity modification due to low molecular weights, may readily be overcome by utilizing other published syntheses of hyper-branched polymers that afford greater control via chain growth pathways16, non-linear architectures such as stars26, and highly branched polymers9. Further advances in preparing flexible, lipophilic hyper-branched polymers would also be advantageous for lubricant applications. Our ongoing interests include various non-linear architectures which may be exploited as a dual viscosity index improver and boundary friction modifier. These investigations will be published in the near future."

Several samples would become turbid and precipitate out at temperatures below 50\u2009\u00b0C. This required additional agitation prior to viscosity and friction measurements. Dynamic viscosity was measured with several instruments, depending on the needs and temperature range of the instrument. The viscosity data was recorded in centipoise (cP) and converted into centistokes (cSt) by dividing the centipoise value by the density of the blend. The density (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009g/mL) of the neat oil and blends were measured at room temperature utilizing 5\u2009mL volumetric flasks and a quantitative mass balance (4 decimal places). Three aliquots were measured for each oil blend at 2\u2009wt % and these densities were averaged among themselves. We found that the densities of the additized oils were the same to the second decimal place (0.86\u2009g/mL). The group I oil\u2019s density was slightly lower (0.84\u2009g/mL). A Brookfield viscometer was equipped with a cooling/heating jacket that was continuously flowing with oil supplied by an external cooling/heating bath that regulated the temperature at 40 and 100\u2009\u00b0C. A rotating spindle (0.3\u2212100 RPM) was submerged into the blended oil at the regulated temperatures and the dynamic shear was reported on the digital screen with a respective torsion percent. The cP value with the highest torsion percent was used for viscosity index calculations. Viscosity was measured by the dropping ball viscometer at 10 and 23\u2009\u00b0C. A Tannas TBS viscometer was utilized to measure the viscosity of the blended oils at 150\u2009\u00b0C while under a shear rate of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009s\u22121.

A variable load-speed bearing tester (VLBT) was utilized to measure friction coefficients28. The load was applied through a stiff spring that was compressed by a ball screw at the end of the load arm. A 25.4\u2009mm square coupon of A2 tool steel was used to press against a 25.4\u2009mm diameter rotating steel bar of AISI 8620 alloy steel. A cartridge heater was installed under the coupon holder to control the temperature. The oil was supplied at the beginning of each test by filling the coupon holder. A 50\u2009N normal load was applied for tests at 23\u2009\u00b0C and a 26\u2009N normal load was applied for those at 100\u2009\u00b0C. The speed cycle was in a 0.1\u2009m/s steps between 1.7\u2009m/s and 0.2\u2009m/s. The period for each step was 10\u2009seconds. There were 3 cycles tested for each sample for a total of 480\u2009seconds.

The reaction flask was then degassed and left under vacuum for ca. 30\u2009minutes. The reaction flask was backfilled with argon and left under an argon-inflated balloon. Acetonitrile (~300\u2009mL) was transferred into the reaction flask via cannula and positive argon pressure. While stirring the mixture, 6-bromo-1-hexanol (13.94\u2009g, 0.076\u2009mol, ~2.2 equivalents) was added via syringe. The reaction was then heated until a medium reflux was achieved. In ca. 12\u2009hours the reaction mixture turned brown and TLC analysis indicated the consumption of benzoate (5% MeOH/DCM; UV active). The insoluble species were removed by filtration, the filtrate was collected and the volatile organics were removed via roto-evaporation.
