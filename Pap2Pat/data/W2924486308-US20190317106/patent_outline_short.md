# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD

- relate to prognosis prediction method

## BACKGROUND

- describe kidney function
- limitations of existing diagnostic markers

## SUMMARY

### Technical Problem

- identify need for new prognosis prediction marker

### Solution to Problem

- propose chiral amino acid-based prognosis prediction method

### Advantageous Effects of Invention

- provide accurate prognosis prediction marker

## DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS

- introduce method for predicting prognosis for kidney disease
- measure amount of chiral amino acid in blood sample
- correlate measured amount with prognosis for subject
- use arbitrary technique for correlation
- use index value resulted from processing measured amount
- predict poor prognosis if amount of D-amino acid exceeds cutoff value
- determine borderline of high level group by analyzing cohorts
- use statistical processing method to determine cutoff value
- measure amount of chiral amino acid using known method
- predict prognosis by combining index value with variable relating to kidney disease
- carry out treatment corresponding to predicted prognosis
- assess kidney disease based on amount of chiral amino acid
- determine eGFR value based on amount of chiral amino acid

### EXAMPLES

- conduct patient study
- prepare plasma samples
- measure amino acid enantiomers
- perform statistical analysis
- present results
