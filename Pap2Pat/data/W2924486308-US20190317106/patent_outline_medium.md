# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD

- relate to prognosis prediction method

## BACKGROUND

- introduce kidney function
- describe acute kidney disease
- describe chronic kidney disease
- motivate need for prognosis prediction marker

## SUMMARY

### Technical Problem

- state need for prognosis prediction marker

### Solution to Problem

- introduce chiral amino acids for prognosis prediction

### Advantageous Effects of Invention

- provide prognosis prediction marker

## DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS

- introduce method for predicting prognosis for kidney disease
- measure amount of chiral amino acid in blood sample
- correlate measured amount with prognosis for subject
- use arbitrary technique for correlation
- use index value resulted from processing measured amount
- use variables influencing amount of chiral amino acid
- correlate with poor prognosis if amount exceeds cutoff value
- determine cutoff value by analyzing and statistically processing cohorts
- use Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model
- measure amount of chiral amino acid using known methods
- use o-phthalaldehyde and N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-cysteine for derivatization
- use fluorescent reagent and Pirkle-type chiral stationary phase column
- use optical resolution column system
- predict prognosis using index value based on chiral amino acid
- combine index value with other chiral amino acids or variables
- use variables relating to kidney disease
- take variables into consideration using statistical processing
- use multiple Cox regression analysis
- carry out treatment corresponding to predicted prognosis
- assess kidney disease based on amount of chiral amino acid
- identify kidney disease using amounts of chiral amino acids
- assess severity of kidney disease
- determine eGFR values based on amount of chiral amino acid
- determine eGFR value using predetermined regression curve
- classify measured values into groups corresponding to eGFR values
- output prognosis information using sample analysis system

### EXAMPLES

- register patients for study
- collect and prepare blood samples
- define inclusion and exclusion criteria
- evaluate renal function using eGFR
- prepare samples for 2D-HPLC analysis
- measure amino acid enantiomers using 2D-HPLC
- perform statistical processing of data
- present cohort amino acid metabolomic profiles
- correlate chiral amino acids with clinical parameters
- correlate kidney outcome with chiral amino acids
- evaluate hazard ratios for kidney outcome
