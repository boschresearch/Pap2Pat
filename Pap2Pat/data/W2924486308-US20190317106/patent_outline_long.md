## DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS

- introduce method for predicting prognosis for kidney disease
- measure amount of chiral amino acid in blood sample
- correlate measured amount with prognosis for subject
- use arbitrary technique for correlation
- use index value resulted from processing measured amount
- use concentration ratio or percentage against corresponding isomer
- use age, body weight, gender, BMI or eGFR as variable
- correlate with poor prognosis if amount exceeds cutoff value
- correlate with favorable prognosis if amount does not exceed cutoff value
- determine whether cutoff value is exceeded
- assess prognosis based on comparison result
- predict prognosis for subjects not afflicted with disease
- predict prognosis for subjects not yet diagnosed with kidney disease
- predict prognosis for healthy individuals
- predict prognosis for patients suffering from disease other than kidney disease
- classify risk for kidney disease in the future
- predict kidney outcome or death
- predict end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
- predict death by any cause
- select arbitrary point in time for prognosis prediction
- classify amount of chiral amino acid into two or more groups
- predict prognosis corresponding to classification
- use D-form or L-form of proteinogenic amino acid
- distinguish between D-form and L-form for high accuracy
- measure amount of chiral amino acid using known method
- use o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) or N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-cysteine (Boc
- use fluorescent reagent, such as 4-fluoro-7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxazole (NBD
- use Pirkle-type chiral stationary phase column
- use optical resolution column system
- measure concentrations of D- and L-amino acids
- use immunological method using monoclonal antibody
- use index value based on chiral amino acid alone
- combine index value with index value based on other chiral amino acids
- combine index value with variable relating to kidney disease
- use history of diabetes, age, gender, hemoglobin level, mean blood pressure
- use known kidney disease diagnostic or prognosis predictive markers
- use eGFR, blood creatinine concentration, cystatin C and urinary protein level
- take variables into consideration using statistical processing
- use multiple Cox regression analysis
- carry out treatment corresponding to predicted prognosis
- carry out lifestyle improvement, dietary counseling, blood pressure management
- carry out blood sugar management or lipid management
- assess kidney disease based on amount of chiral amino acid
- identify kidney disease using amounts of chiral amino acids
- assess severity of kidney disease
- determine borderline for assessing kidney disease
- use ROC analysis and the t-test
- use mean, median and X percentile values of healthy subject group or patient group
- determine eGFR values based on amount of chiral amino acid
- determine eGFR value based on measured value of chiral amino acid
- use predetermined regression curve
- classify measured values for groups
