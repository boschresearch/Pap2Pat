    "abstract": "This paper presented a morphology-selective preparation and formation mechanism of few-layer graphene (FLG) on a Cu substrate by pulsed laser ablation in liquid. It is a simple and controllable route to grow FLG directly on the surface of a copper foil at ambient temperature and normal pressure, which does not need other precursor materials. FLG with 3\u201310 layers of thickness and continuous hundreds of micrometers in lateral size is obtained. The morphology and structure of FLG were investigated by using a Raman spectrometer, scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, and atomic force microscope. The formation mechanism of FLG and the role of the plasma-produced carbon species are put forward based on the interaction between the laser, material, and substrate. Our finding, the direct deposition of FLG on the Cu substrate by pulsed laser ablation in liquid, will open a door to apply this green route to the production of FLG with controlled morphology.",

                "Graphene has attracted tremendous attention and continuous research because of its excellent electrical and optical properties that make it prospective for applications in the next generation of energy conversion, electronic products, sensors, and biosensors. 1,2 Several preparation methods, such as micromechanical exfoliation, 3 hydrogen arc discharge, 4 chemical exfoliation, [5][6][7] and epitaxial growth 8 on the substrate, have been employed to obtain graphene from graphite. Among these methods, micromechanical exfoliation can avoid damage to the sp 2 structure to produce the highest quality graphene. 5 However, the micromechanical exfoliation method is not suitable for mass production due to the glue it leaves on the sample's surface and also causes secondary pollution of graphene. 6 In recent years, the liquid-phase pulsed laser ablation (LPLA) method [9][10][11] has attracted more and more attention in preparation of carbon nanomaterials for its unique superiority. In our previous study, we also reported the formation of graphene nanoribbons from flake graphite by LPLA, which presented a unique way to synthesize two-dimensional carbon materials. 11 However, the preparation of few-layer graphene (FLG) or graphene nanoribbons directly in the suspension requires subsequent separation and purification, resulting in lower yields. Only a few products are separated, and most of them cannot be collected effectively. In this letter, we report a method for direct deposition of FLG on the Cu foil using a nanosecond pulsed laser ablation experiment in de-ionized water. We have investigated the effects of the laser energy and substrate on the structure and the number of layers of the FLG."

                "The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1(a). Commercial flake graphite (average diameter = 7 \u03bcm and carbon content >99.9%) was used with de-ionized water. The volume of the graphite-water suspension is 350 ml, and the concentration of the suspension remains between 0.02 g/ml and 0.03 g/ml. The graphite suspension was used for ablation after ultrasonic dispersion for about 45 min. A 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm polished Cu foil was placed under the surface of solution at about 3-4 mm. The mixed solution above the Cu foil was ablated by the vertical pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam (wavelength = 1064 nm and repetition rate = 10 Hz) with a pulse width of 10 ns. To fully absorb the laser energy, the spot diameter was around 1 mm with a defocusing amount of 2 mm. According to the laser scan path shown in Fig. 1(b), the relative movement time of the laser in the adjacent two impact center points was set to 0.1 s. The laser energies used throughout the experiment were 0.1 J, 0.2 J, 0.3 J, and 0.4 J. During the experimental process, the graphite suspension was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. After laser processing, the Cu foil was rinsed with acetone, alcohol, and de-ionized water, and finally dried with nitrogen to be used for characterization."

When the laser energy was below 0.4 J, the pristine and ablated samples are well recorded by the Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. 2.

                        "observed in the figure, the weaker D peak of the raw graphite indicates that the original graphite structure is complete. 12 With regard to the samples treated by laser energy from 0.1 to 0.3 J, the D and G bands are observed in the spectra at around 1350 and 1580 cm -1 corresponding to the generated FLG. 13 Figure 2 and Table I show the differences of the intensity, shape, and position of the 2D band between different laser energy ablated samples and pristine graphite. As the laser energy drops from 0.3 to 0.1 J, the position of the 2D peak of the treated samples moves from 2698.51 to 2689.60 cm -1 . It is widely accepted that the increase in layers will result in blue shift of the 2D peak. 14 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the three groups of samples is 64.74, 63.83, and 53.06 cm -1 , respectively, showing that the products in this experiment are FLG. The presence of FLG and the number of layers of FLG can be determined by I 2D /I G . 15 The 2D peak of graphite is asymmetrical, and a small shoulder peak can be found around 2679 cm -1 . However, the 2D band of the monolayer graphene is symmetrical and the larger the number of layers is, the less obvious the symmetry is, and the samples are more inclined to be graphite. 16 From Fig. 2 and Table I, it could be induced that there is FLG in the processed samples, the number of layers increases with the rise of the laser energy, and disorder in the sp 2 carbon network has the same trend.",
                        "The morphology of the as-prepared FLG is further identified by SEM. Only a few tiny pieces of FLG are deposited on the Cu foil with a laser energy of 0.1 J [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. With the laser energy increased from 0.1 J to 0.3 J, the area occupied by the FLG on the Cu foil is enlarged, and the resulting FLG morphology is also more complete. As can be seen from Fig. 3(e), the maximum lateral size of the continuous FLG film can reach hundreds of micrometers. To further observe the fine features of FLG on the surface of the Cu foil, the sample in Fig. 3(a) is enlarged 20 000 times in Fig. 3(c). As shown in the figure, FLG is observed to be a thin layer of carbon material under SEM.  Laser energy (J) 2D peak (cm -1 ) FWHM of 2D (cm  The number of layers of FLG was further characterized by HRTEM. Figure 4(a) is the HRTEM image of the sample ablated with a laser energy of 0.1 J. The lattice spacing of the layer-structure is about 0.355 nm, which is similar to the spacing of {002} planes of graphite (0.356 nm). 17,18 The presence of FLG is confirmed by the similarity of lattice spacing. The edge of the folded sample shows 3 layer structure. Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show different edges of FLG when the laser energy is 0.2 J and 0.3 J, indicating that FLG with 8-10 layers are prepared, which is in accordance with our AFM images (Fig. 5). As is illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the uniformity and long-range continuity FLG films can be clearly proved by micrographs. Figure 5(b) shows that the thickness of the films is about 1.60-2.50 nm, indicating a FLG.",
                        "Based on the experimental observations, the FLG growth mechanism on the Cu foil is proposed as follows. LPLA is a fast and nonequilibrium process which has been testified to be a method to prepare a large number of micro-nanomaterials. [19][20][21] When using the pulsed laser to shock the graphite target in the liquid medium, the whole system will follow the law of conservation of energy, 22",

                        "As shown in Fig. 6(a), the graphite particles are uniformly suspended in the solution. The water serves as both the absorbing layer and the constraining layer. The junction of the laser and graphite is the main factor taken into consideration during the photothermal process. 10 The laser irradiates the material in an aqueous solution, causing fast ejection of carbon atoms, ions, carbon ions, free hydrogen and radicals, oxygen ions, and small fragments of the graphene sheets and then generating dense gas plasma plumes. After a series of complex photothermal changes, the plasma plume rapidly expands around to generate a high-pressure shock front and undergoes complex physical and chemical reactions with the surrounding liquid environment, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Eventually, it collapses and forms bubbles. 25 Furthermore, laser pulses result in more plasma formation, and the species grow on the existing nuclei. 26 The bubbles containing carbon atoms, carbon ions, and carbon clusters expand outward at high speed. With the intervention of the solid-liquid interface, the bubbles have a pressure difference between the two sides. The high-pressure region of the vacuole wall is deformed and depressed, finally forming a microjet toward the solid surface. [27][28][29] After the cooling process, carbon layer segments form amorphous carbon clusters and graphene layers on the surface of the Cu foil due to its function of adsorbing and catalyzing the graphitization of carbon atoms, as shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). The number of layers of graphene is controlled by adjustment of the laser energy. Sakka [30][31][32] reported that when a pulsed laser (pulse width of 10 ns, laser wavelength of 532 nm, and power density of 10 9 W/cm 2 ) irradiates a graphite target in an aqueous solution, a plasma plume with a temperature of 4000 K-5000 K, pressure of 10-15 GPa, and density of 10 12 -10 23 cm -3 can be generated. The high-density of the plasma plume leads to the increase in collision probability between carbon ions and atoms and induces the deposition of FLG on the Cu foil during the laser ablation process.",
                        "With the laser energy increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 J, there will be more carbon plasma formed and converted into micro-sized graphene during the complex process. This leads to an increase in the lateral size and the number of layers of the FLG. As the laser energy increases, the total energy in the liquid system increases. During the rapid heating and cooling process, in order to maintain the thermodynamic stability of the whole system, the recovery stress of the system will become greater, resulting in an increase in the degree of disorder of FLG. 11 As shown in Fig. 6(d), laser heating on the surface of the Cu foil results in a rapid temperature rise and drop, which contributes to the rapid growth of the graphene structure. 33,34 LPLA directly catalyzes the decomposition of the carbon source into carbon atoms. Therefore, the deposition of FLG prepared by this method on the Cu foil is not a self-limiting process."

FLG with 3-10 layers and continuous hundreds of micrometers in lateral size was obtained. In particular, the number of layers, size, and morphology of FLG may be well controlled by applying appropriate laser energy. The ablation of the laser induces the production of a large quantity of free carbon atoms and ions, forming a high temperature and high-pressure plasma near the surface of the Cu foil. In the rapid heating and cooling process, graphite atoms are adsorbed and graphitized by the Cu substrate and finally extended on the rapidly heated and cooled Cu foil and formed into FLG films."
