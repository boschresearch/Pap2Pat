    "abstract": "Switchable antiferromagnetic (AFM) memory devices are provided based on an active material, FexNbS2, where x>1/3 and FexNbS2 where x<1/3, that exhibits the ability to manipulate spin information \u201cnon-locally\u201d i.e. tens of microns away from the electrical stimulus. Spin information can be transported and stored non-locally in the FexNbS2 material. The devices leverage two long range effects: collective excitations to carry spin and strong magnetoelastic coupling to allow complex domain structures to propagate over large distances. The application of current pulses across the material can rotate or switch the AFM order between multiple directions. Non-local resistance measurements can detect the orientation of the AFM order as high or low resistance states. The state of the device can be set by input current pulses, and read-out by the resistance measurement, forming a non-volatile, AFM memory storage bit.",

This is because the conduction electrons scatter spin and the transfer is constrained by the mean free path in the direction of the applied current. Coherent spin transport through collective excitations has therefore been limited to insulators and has not been extensively evaluated in metallic systems.",

This takes place in crystals which have been fabricated to support the application of brief, orthogonal DC current pulses in one portion of the device, and the measurement of resistance in a remote portion of the device. Crystals are grown with an appropriate amount of disorder and an additional coexisting magnetic order is introduced. The additional coexisting magnetic order is known as a spin glass and is believed to be integral to the long-distance transfer of information. Fabrication of devices is preferably performed using a high-precision focused ion beam approach and characterizing of the non-local switching behavior in the devices takes place along locations in a distal neck portion of the material.",

This is orders of magnitude further than the electron scattering length, or the magnon decay length of typical metallic antiferromagnets.",

In general, the physical process is intrinsically local: spin is carried by an electrical current, imparted into the magnetic system, and the spin texture then rotates. The collective excitations of complex spin textures utilized in this context to transport spin over much longer distances while using much lower power. Spin information can be transported and stored non-locally in the material FexNbS2. The collective modes leverage the strong magnetoelastic coupling in the system to achieve a novel way to store spin information in complex magnetic systems.",
                        "Fabricated devices centered on iron-intercalated niobium disulfide demonstrated non-local switching responses, which were comparable in magnitude to the local switching response in most cases.",
                        "Embodiments described herein allow for the transfer and storage of information in a novel way, transporting spin information via the collective excitations of an antiferromagnet and then storing that information by leveraging the interactions between antiferromagnetic domains. This result is surprising because these collective modes typically dissipate over distances about a thousand times smaller than the ones over which we see information being transported in the devices.",

Several embodiments of the technology are described generally in FIG. 1 to FIG. 18 to illustrate the characteristics and functionality of the devices, systems, materials and methods. It will be appreciated that the methods may vary as to the specific steps and sequence and the systems and apparatus may vary as to structural details without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein. The method steps are merely exemplary of the order that these steps may occur. The steps may occur in any order that is desired, such that it still performs the goals of the claimed technology.",
                        "Turning now to FIG. 1, the general structure 10 of one basic 8-terminal device configuration fabricated from single crystals of a class of a magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide AxMC2 materials is shown schematically. A crystal of an antiferromagnetic material 12 is microstructured as shown in FIG. 1. The switching device may be made from a bulk crystal that has at least one neck portion extending radially from the body of the material.",

Although electronically accessible, non-volatile, antiferromagnetic memory storage devices are demonstrated with Fe1/3NbS2 to illustrate the technology, other designs and compositions can be used as active materials to produce a variety of switchable antiferromagnetic memory storage devices.",
                        "In the simple embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the device has opposing pairs of terminals that are triangular in shape and oriented to define two orthogonal pulse bars 16, 18 in the general shape of a cross. The two orthogonal pulse bars 16, 18 are marked A and B in FIG. 1. The AC probe current is applied along the path 20 that is marked Iprobe. The local signal is measured using the contacts 22 labeled V0, and the non-local signals are measured using the contacts 24, 26 that are labeled V1 and V2 in this embodiment.",
                        "The two linear bars \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d forming each pulse bar 16,18 of the cross may be used to apply orthogonal DC current pulses. The application of a sufficiently large DC current pulse along one pulse bar 16 of the device will rotate the AFM order to a fixed angle with respect to the current pulse through a spin transfer torque. Applying a DC pulse along the other pulse bar 18, will do the same with respect to that pulse, resulting in a rotation of the AFM order by approximately 90 degrees. Accordingly, the AFM order can be switched back and forth between two orthogonal orientations with the controlled application of DC pulses to each pulse bar.",
                        "The orientation of the AFM order can then be read out through a resistance measurement along one of the legs of the crossed bars. Generally, the resistance measurement will show a high or low value depending on the orientation of the AFM order due to the intrinsic anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in the AFM materials.",
                        "The DC current pulse sets the direction of the AFM order that can then be read out as a high or low resistance state. Likewise, the state of the device can be set by the input DC current pulses, and read-out by the resistance measurement, forming a non-volatile, AFM memory storage bit.",
                        "In FIG. 1, the device is designed to measure the non-local switching response of the antiferromagnetic texture of FexNbS2 material 12. A brief DC current pulse between 104 and 105 A/cm2 is applied between the contacts of pulse bar 16 marked A or the contacts of pulse bar 18 marked B. The DC current pulses are applied with a view to triggering magnons that can transport spin down the neck of the device. When this pulse is completed, the direction of the AFM order has been switched tens of microns away from where the current pulse was applied. The switched AFM order is observable via the transverse resistance as measured between the contacts marked \u201cV1\u201d or the contacts marked \u201cV2,\u201d which will increase or decrease compared to the original state of the crystal following the application of these current pulses.",
                        "The transverse resistance is measured with an AC probe current (denoted with Iprobe) at three distinct locations goes to either a higher or lower resistance state, depending on whether an A or B pulse has been administered. The contacts marked V0, which intersect the current pulse bars are referred to as local, and the contacts marked V1 and V2 are referred to as non-local contacts.",
                        "The compound FexNbS2 is an easy-axis antiferromagnet on a triangular sublattice and a material 12 that has been found to switch between distinct resistance states upon the application of DC current pulses along perpendicular directions. Importantly, it appears that collective dynamics of the magnetic spin texture plays an important role with this directional switching, with very high tunability by compositional changes about x approximately equal to 1/3.",
                        "Recent work has shown that there are two nearly degenerate antiferromagnetic ground states in FexNbS2, one in which the spins form stripes and one in which they form zig-zags as illustrated schematically in FIG. 2 through FIG. 6. These orders compete, with the stripe order dominating at dilute compositions x<1/3, and zig-zag in the excess Fe composition x>1/3. The circles in these figures are iron atoms oriented in one plane. Lines drawn between iron atoms indicate that their spins are aligned.",
                        "Domain structures for each different kind of magnetic order are shown schematically in FIG. 2 through FIG. 5. Following a horizontal current pulse in a stripe-dominated sample, for example, the domain with a principal axis parallel to the current pulse is disfavored, resulting in a combination of the other two domain orientations as illustrated in FIG. 2. Following a vertical current pulse, however, the domain with principal axis perpendicular to the pulse is favored as depicted in FIG. 3.",
                        "Similarly, in zig-zag dominated samples, a horizontal current pulse favors domains whose principal axes are not parallel to the pulse as seen in FIG. 4, while a vertical current pulse favors the domain whose principal axis is perpendicular to the current pulse direction as shown in FIG. 5.",
                        "It can be seen that the domain configurations in the panels shown in FIG. 2 and in FIG. 4 have opposite conductivity anisotropies, as do those shown FIG. 3 and in FIG. 5. When stripe and zig-zag orders coexist, however, there will be competing switching responses, as shown schematically in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7.",
                        "Accordingly, a given direction of switching pulse j destabilizes domains whose principal axes are parallel to the applied current, so that a pulse in the [100] direction will strongly disfavor one specific stripy domain (e.g. FIG. 3) and one specific zig-zag domain (e.g. FIG. 5).",
                        "With respect to the principal axes, the conductivity tensor components \u03c3xx>\u03c3yy for stripe domains and \u03c3xx<\u03c3yy for zigzag domains, so when the current is applied along 45\u00b0, this leads to opposite switching responses in the off-diagonal conductivity. At compositions where the order parameters are comparable in magnitude, one would expect the response to vanish, which is exactly what is observed at x=1/3.",
                        "The complexities of the competing order parameters notwithstanding, the collective dynamics associated with the ordered phases or with the coexisting spin-glass phase will have collective modes that can carry spin currents. Typically, scattering off conduction electrons has limited the spin decay length to nanometers, and only in insulating antiferromagnets can this length be extended to microns.",
                        "However, such magnons can be used to also store information non-locally in the same antiferromagnet. It would mean that the elementary excitations of a magnetic texture rotate the magnetic texture itself. It has been shown that this unusual situation can be realized in a single material. By leveraging the intertwined order parameters of FexNbS2, spin information is not only carried far from the regions carrying the pulse current, but can also store information non-locally, tens of microns away from the active area.",

The nonmonotonic behavior seen here is possibly linked to the existence of two order parameters, the stripe and the zigzag phases, being affected at slightly different energies and their reorientation having opposite effects on the resistivity.",

First, the non-local contact which is closest to the edge of the crystal, while requiring a larger current density, tends to have a larger switching response than the non-local contact which is closer to the active area of the device. Second, the non-local contacts generally exhibit an opposite response to the non-local contacts, i.e. the same current pulse will raise the local transverse resistance and lower the non-local transverse resistance.

It was observed that all three locations (V0, V1 and V2) on the device switched at lower current densities as the temperature increased. The threshold switching current grows with increasing temperature below the AFM temperature, as if following the AFM order parameter. Therefore, the disappearance of the switching response at the Neel temperature demonstrates a direct connection between the switching and the AFM order. Above 15K, the observed relaxation in between current pulses was increasingly apparent for the local contacts.",
                                "The response of \u03c3xx between the 25 \u03bcm and 35 \u03bcm non-local contact is shown in FIG. 15. The non-local Rxx response closely mimics the 25 \u03bcm non-local Rxy response, with a peak just below 10.5\u00d7104 A/cm2. The response of \u03c3xx is notably absent where the 35 \u03bcm non-local \u03c3xy response is strongest; this response suggests that the full conductivity tensor is affected in the 25 \u03bcm non-local region, whereas the 35 \u03bcm non-local region has a dominant response only in the off-diagonal components \u03c3xy. This could be explained by increased domain-wall scattering in the former, whereas the latter has fewer domains. In order to explain the opposite response between the local and 35 \u03bcm non-local switching, the average principal axis must be similarly oriented in the opposite direction.",
                                "The temperature dependence of the switching amplitude shown in FIG. 16, FIG. 17 and FIG. 18 is strongly indicative that the threshold current required for the switching is proportional to the magnitude of two antiferromagnetic order parameters, each of which oppositely affects the conductivity tensor. The zig-zag and stripe order parameters onset at different current thresholds, just as they onset at different temperatures, as schematically shown in FIG. 7. This leads to the unusual peak structure in the switching response as a function of current density where the dominant order parameter rotates the conductivity tensor one way (the zig-zag since x>1/3), and then as the other grows it begins to rotate the conductivity tensor back (the sub-dominant stripy order). This same form was observed in the non-local contacts, suggesting the same kind of order parameter competition is also the cause of the switching observed in these regions. Collective excitations carry spin and rotate the spin texture in these non-local regions in the same way that the spin-polarized current pulses do in the local region.",
                                "Two unusual features from the data deserve some attention: (i) The non-local response closer to the active area has a consistently smaller signal than that closer to the crystal's edge; and (ii) The second non-local region has an average principal axis orientation that is always opposite to that of the local region. Both of these effects appear to be connected by the elastic energy of the system.",
                                "Additionally, recent work shows that the antiferromagnetic order is strongly coupled to a structural distortion. Similar to martensites, these magnetostrictive effects can prefer a multi-domain state due to the difference between the surface and bulk of the sample, though the energy penalty of creating a domain boundary must be overcome. For clamped samples, which are mechanically secured with TorrSeal epoxy resin, the incompatibility between the bulk strain induced by the AFM order and the surface strain acts as an \u201celastic charge\u201d that produces a long-range field introducing a competing energy that can make multi-domain states favorable, similar to the long-range magnetic dipole effect in FMs.",
                                "Therefore, away from the local regions where spin is transferred due to the driving current, which will be smaller in size than the full sample, the system will tend to rotate in the opposite direction in order to preserve approximately equal total domain sizes of the different orientations. Since the clamped boundary is the originator of the long-range forces, it is natural to expect that this effect is most stark close to the crystal's edge, as seen in the 35 \u03bcm non-local \u03c3xy response, while the region surrounding the closer non-local contacts would need to rearrange less. The 25 \u03bcm non-local response would then detect domain wall scattering and smaller re-orientations of the Neel vector, explaining its relatively smaller response in xy and larger response in \u03c3xx, just as observed.",
                                "This data unambiguously showed that the spin information imparted by the current pulses was carried tens of microns away from the current carrying region, implying an important role for spin-carrying collective excitations coupled to the magnetoelasticity of the system. These scales are orders of magnitude larger than spin decay lengths of typical metallic antiferromagnets, which is a welcome discovery relevant for potential technologies based on metallic antiferromagnets.",
                                "The observation of non-local switching due to collective antiferromagnetic dynamics should open a new pathway to magnonic memory and other spintronic applications of complex antiferromagnets.",
