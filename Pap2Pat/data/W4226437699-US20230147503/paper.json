    "title": "Long-range, Non-local Switching of Spin Textures in a Frustrated  Antiferromagnet",
    "date": "2021-11-18",
    "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging area of quantum technologies that leverage the coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in exotic materials. Spin-orbit interactions allow spin or angular momentum to be injected via electrical stimuli to manipulate the spin texture of a material, enabling the storage of information and energy. In general, the physical process is intrinsically local: spin is carried by an electrical current, imparted into the magnetic system, and the spin texture then rotates. The collective excitations of complex spin textures have rarely been utilized in this context, even though they can in principle transport spin over much longer distances, using much lower power. In this study, we show that spin information can be transported and stored non-locally in the material Fe$_x$NbS$_2$. We propose that collective modes leverage the strong magnetoelastic coupling in the system to achieve this, revealing a novel way to store spin information in complex magnetic systems",

                "The two order parameters are known to have strong magnetoelastic coupling 19 and so it is likely that strain can be used to tune the switching behavior. To demonstrate this, we study the switching behavior under strain. Figure 1b,c show switching responses observed for the same x = 0.31 device, where Fig. 1b is the response after the device is cooled with no applied strain and Fig. 1c is the response after being cooled with strain (corresponding to an applied 40 V to the piezoelectric cube the device was mounted on). At the current density shown, there is a change in the sign of the switching response due to the applied strain. At higher current densities, the original sign is recovered (see Fig. S1 in the supplement), so that there is a sign flip as a function of the pulse current density. This similarity to the x = 0.35 sample behavior could be explained by the strain subtly altering the RKKY-dominated exchange constants and allowing a slight increase in the minority zigzag phase, as illustrated in Fig. 1e. Supporting this interpretation, we note the difference in the lattice parameter between the zig-zag and stripe phase is comparable to the strain applied by the piezoelectric (see Supplementary Figs. S3-S6 for high-resolution cryogenic XRD). Strain can therefore tune the switching response for a x = 0.31 device, to that of a device with x = 0.35-a direct indication magneto-elastic coupling can be used to manipulate the domain structure of the magnetic texture.",
                "With the importance of magneto-elastic coupling established, we now turn to how this can be leveraged to allow long-range transport of spin to store information. Heat capacity and magnetization measurements of characteristic samples are shown in Fig. 2a,b,respectively, showing magnetic transitions and spin glass behavior consistent with our previous characterizations of Fe 1/3 NbS 2 and Fe 0.35 NbS 2 11,20   . In Fig. 2c we illustrate a device designed to measure the non-local switching response of the antiferromagnetic texture of Fe x NbS 2 . DC current pulses are applied along the directions denoted as A and B, with a view to triggering magnons that can transport spin down the neck of the device. After the application of a pulse, the transverse resistance is measured with a probe current I probe at three distinct locations and goes to either a higher or lower resistance state, when a pulse current I pulse is applied in either the A or B direction. The lowtemperature longitudinal resistivities of the devices measured had some small variations but were generally close to 10 -4 \u03a9 cm. The contacts marked V 0 , which intersect the current pulse bars, will be referred to as local, and the contacts marked V 1 and V 2 will be referred to as nonlocal in this paper.  Voltage is applied between two electrodes around a cube of piezoelectric material, causing a directional expansion of the material which strains the device mounted on the cube.",
                "In Fig. 3 we show that the device has both local and non-local responses to the current pulses. Figure 3a shows the local response as a function of pulse current density. The response is not monotonic, turning on at about 8 \u00d7 10 4 A/cm 2 , quickly reaching a maximum, and then decreasing slightly to reach a stable level around 11.4 \u00d7 10 4 A/cm 2 . The measurements taken at 25 and 35 \u03bcm from the center of the active portion of the device are shown in Fig. 3b,c, respectively. The measurement taken 35 \u03bcm from the center requires a larger current density to register a change from the pulses than is necessary at 25 \u03bcm from the center, and both require larger current densities than the local response. The relative sizes of the responses vary from device to device, but the current density required is largely unchanged. Similar devices made of Fe x NbS 2 x \u2248 1/3 show weak local switching, but no stable switching response at the non-local contacts (see  Supplementary Fig. S2). The progressively larger current densities required to observe a switching response further from the active area of the device are largely consistent with the propagation of magnons, which dissipate with distance. There are two notably surprising aspects to this result, however. First, the non-local contact V 2 , while requiring a larger current density, tends to have a larger switching response than the non-local contact V 1 , which is closer to the active area. Second, the non-local contacts generally exhibit an opposite switching response to the local contacts V 0 , so that the pulse directed in the same direction (A or B) will raise the local transverse resistance but lower the non-local transverse resistance. This suggests that the preferred domain orientation upon a current pulse differs between the two regions. By symmetry, the longitudinal resistivity should be weakly affected by the current pulses 7 , leaving domain wall scattering as the most likely origin of changes to \u03c1 xx . The response of \u03c1 xx between the 25 and 35 \u03bcm non-local contact is shown in Fig. 3d. The non-local \u03c1 xx response closely mimics the 25 \u03bcm non-local \u03c1 xy response, with a peak just below 10.5 \u00d7 10 4 A/cm 2 . The response of \u03c1 xx is notably absent where the 35 \u03bcm non-local \u03c1 xy response V 2 is strongest; this immediately suggests that there is significant domain wall scattering when V 1 has a maximal response and far less when V 2 has a maximum response. The opposite response between the local and 35 \u03bcm non-local switching not only suggests that the average principal axis of highest conductivity must be rotated in the perpendicular direction, but that there must also be fewer domains when this rotation occurs.",
                "Figure 4b shows the temperature dependence of the pulse current with the maximum switching response for both local and non-local contacts (see Supplementary Figs. S7-S9). These measurements were taken on a device with non-local contacts 20 and 27 \u03bcm away from the center of the active area. At all three locations on the device, the threshold switching current grows with increasing temperature below the AFM temperature, closely mimicking neutron scattering measurements of the peak intensity corresponding to the AFM order parameter (Fig. 4a). This, and the disappearance of the switching response at the N\u00e9el temperature demonstrates a direct connection between the threshold current for switching and the opening of an AFM gap."

                "The temperature dependence of the switching amplitude shown in Fig. 4 is strongly indicative that the switching threshold current is proportional to the magnitude of the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The non-monotonic shape of the switching behavior as a function of current density observed locally is also observed in the non-local contacts, suggesting the same underlying behavior is also present in these regions.",
                "Two unusual features from the data deserve some attention. (i) The non-local response closer to the active area (V 1 ) has a consistently smaller signal than that further away (V 2 ). (ii) The second non-local region has an average principal axis of the highest conductivity that is always oriented perpendicular to that of the local region.",
                "We suggest that both of these effects are connected by the magneto-elastic response of the system. Little et al. recently showed that the antiferromagnetic order is strongly coupled to a structural distortion. Here, we have demonstrated that strain can directly control the sign of the switching response (Fig. 1b,c) 21 . The devices studied are clamped by the adhesive holding them to our test platform, so when the system undergoes the AFM transition, the minimization of the overall strain will favor a multi-domain state. This is similar to magnetostrictive effects in martensites which also balance elastic energy against the penalty of forming domain boundaries 22 . When the present system is switched in one region, the competition between bulk and surface strain produces a long-range field [22][23][24][25] , rotating domains in the opposite direction to preserve the balance of different orientations.",
                "Assuming the clamped boundary is the originator of the longrange elastic forces, it is natural to expect that this effect is most stark close to the crystal's edge, explaining the larger response in V 2 than V 1 because it is measured closer to the boundary. The 25 \u03bcm non-local response would then detect domain wall scattering and smaller reorientations of the ordering vector, explaining its relatively smaller response in \u03c1 xy and larger response in \u03c1 xx , which is amplified by domain boundary scattering. Finally, we note that in order for this mechanism to be effective, the internal strain of the device must be significant-comparable to the strains applied in our experiment shown in Fig. 1g of ~0.1%. Given that anisotropy of the lattice parameters themselves is only ~0.1%, this suggests that the applied current pulses must orient a significant fraction of the device into a single domain, away from the active area. This also explains the reduction of \u03c1 xx at higher currents, as a consequence of reduced domain walls. Disorder 26,27 , entropy 28,29 , and leakage current could provide alternative explanations for the equilibrium domain configuration between pulses. Disorder-driven domain formation, however-in which domains are tied to defects-does not explain the stronger signal at the farther non-local contact nor its sign being opposite to the local contacts. Similarly, leakage current also does not explain why switching is so much stronger in the farther non-local contact V 2 than in V 1 . Entropy-driven domain formation should be strongest close to the N\u00e9el temperature, which is inconsistent with the switching being enhanced as the temperature is lowered below the transition. The elastic picture by contrast is very natural in this system and, given the known structural anisotropy 19 , must be active.",
                "However, the elastic response does not alone explain why the current pulses can orient domains so far from the region where the current actually flows. Typically, metals transport spin via their conduction electrons, while magnetic insulators transport spin through collective excitations such as magnons. Conduction electron spin currents generally decay more quickly than magnon spin currents, and in practice, antiferromagnetic metals, in particular, tend to have very short spin diffusion lengths, largely around or under 2 nm-as is, for example, the case in Mn-based alloys 2,[30][31][32][33] . In magnetic insulators, on the other hand, spin decay in single-crystal systems has been extended to ten microns (see the case of \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 18 ). To account for the long distances of spin transport observed here, the transport medium in the present system is likely to also leverage collective modes. Our data suggest that the combined action of spin-carrying collective excitations and the magnetoelastic coupling of the system allow regions of the sample that are tens of microns away to be switched. These scales are orders of magnitude larger than spin decay lengths of typical metallic antiferromagnets, which is a welcome discovery relevant for potential technologies based on such materials 2 . One question is to which order the collective excitations belong. A natural candidate is the antiferromagnetic order itself, whose magnons transfer their spin to the nearest domain wall, but there could also be collective dynamics associated with the competition of the coexisting zig-zag and stripe order parameters. Future work is needed to reveal the precise nature of these ingredients and to elucidate the roles that they play in order to form a full microscopic picture of the mechanism behind the non-local response. For now, it would be interesting to see whether other electrically switchable antiferromagnets can show similar behavior."

Measurements were also taken with the AC probe current turned off and its corresponding leads removed during the switching event itself, and the resulting switching behavior was unchanged. A range of AC probe frequencies was also tested, and aside from an increase or decrease in noise, there was no measurable difference in the resulting behavior. Both of these tests can be found in Supplementary Figs. S10-S12. Data from additional devices are presented in Fig. S14.",
