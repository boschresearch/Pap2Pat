## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Pharmaceutical Compositions

### Effective Doses

## EXAMPLES

### Methods and Materials

### Elevated Intraocular Pressure Induces A1 Astrocyte Reactivity in the Retina

### TNF-α, IL-1α, and C1q Contribute to Retinal Ganglion Cell Death Secondary to eIOP

### Early Retinal Inflammation is Driven by CD11b+ CD11c+ Cells and Persists Beyond IOP Re-Normalization

### NLY01, a GLP-1R Agonist, Reduces IL-1α, TNF-α, and C1q Production by CD11b+ CD11c+ and CD11b+ CD11c− Cells and Decreases A1 Astrocyte Activation During eIOP
