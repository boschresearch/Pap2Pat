## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Catalysts with Pd and Pt on a Lanthanum Doped Alumina Exhibit Enhanced Methane Conversion after Aging in the Presence of Sulfur and Water

### Example 2: A Catalyst with a Lanthanum Doped Alumina Support Exhibits Higher Activity in the Presence of Excess Water Vapour than a Catalyst with an Alumina Support not Doped with Lanthanum

### Example 3: Sulfur Resistance and Hydrothermal Stability of Catalysts having an Alumina Support Doped with Lanthanum at Different Weight Ratios of Platinum and Palladium

### Example 4: Effect of Calcination Temperature on Catalyst Activity

### Example 5: Effect of Method Preparation on Catalyst Activity
