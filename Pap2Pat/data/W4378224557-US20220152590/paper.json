    "title": "Effect of Zirconia on Pd\u2013Pt Supported SBA-15 Catalysts for the Oxidation of Methane",
    "date": "2023-05-24",
    "abstract": "A series of methane oxidation catalysts were prepared by doping Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15), a highly mesoporous silica sieve, with varying amounts of Zr (5, 10, and 15 wt%) and loading with 2 wt% Pd and 4 wt% Pt. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques, including BET, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). Fresh and aged catalysts were evaluated for methane oxidation. Aging was performed using a simulated lean burn natural gas (NG) engine exhaust containing water vapor (10% vol) and sulfur (10 ppm). It was found that the catalyst with 15 wt% zirconia was the most active and stable of the series, exhibiting the lowest T50 of 481 \u00b0C after 40 h of aging. The Pd\u2013Pt catalyst loaded on pure SBA-15 had a T50 of 583 \u00b0C after aging, which was 102 \u00b0C higher than that of the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst with 15 wt% Zr. The results suggest that the increased performance was due to the higher amount of reducible PtOx species in the proximity of ZrO2 and the sulfur scavenging effect of zirconia, which protected the active metals from forming inactive sulfur complexes. Overall, the Pd\u2013Pt catalyst with 15 wt% Zr loaded on SBA-15 demonstrated excellent methane oxidation activity, hydrothermal stability, and sulfur resistance and can be considered a viable candidate for reducing the methane slip from a lean burn NG engine exhaust.",

                "Natural gas (NG) has been considered a fuel of choice in the transition toward a zero-carbon economy in the heavy-duty (lean burn engine) segment. It is abundant, inexpensive, and produces approximately 20-25% less greenhouse gas (GHG) on a lifecycle basis than diesel and gasoline engines. Lean burn NG engines are similar in performance to diesel engines, but they produce high levels of unburned methane (also called methane slip) in the exhaust. Methane requires a higher temperature to achieve combustion than conventional fuels; thus, cold spots or dead volume in an engine cylinder lead to incomplete combustion [1]. The unburned methane needs to be eliminated because it is a potent GHG (~86 GHG impact compared to CO 2 for 20 years after emission) and can negate the benefit of the NG engine [2]. Methane is difficult to oxidize, since the molecule's strong C-H bonds make it highly stable, which prevents low-temperature oxidation and requires a temperature of more than 1000 \u2022 C for complete combustion [3]. Catalytic combustion is considered to be an effective method to reduce methane emissions at low temperatures, and Pd-based catalysts are well known to be highly effective for oxidizing methane under lean burn and low-temperature conditions [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. Despite the superior activity of these catalysts, they are prone to water inhibition and sulfur poisoning [4,11]. As such, they are not very effective at eliminating methane slip during long-term usage under real conditions since sulfur and water are present in the exhaust of lean burn NG vehicles (NGVs).",
                "It is hypothesized that water inhibition for these catalysts is due to the formation of stable Pd(OH) 2 groups and/or blocking of the O interchange between the support and Pd active sites by OH groups [12]. Various researchers have identified that catalysts of Pd on amorphous silica [13] or on zeolite with high silica content [14] used for methane oxidation conferred hydrothermal stability due to silica's hydrophobic nature. Therefore, it would be of interest to explore other types of hydrophobic supports, such as mesoporous silica, to prepare methane oxidation catalysts. In comparison to other silicas, SBA-15 was shown to be a desirable support to load palladium nanoparticles because its unique combination of pore size, pore structure (2D hexagonal), and thick pore walls limits the sintering of metal particles [15].",
                "The presence of water in the exhaust feed is not the only reason for the deactivation of the catalyst. The reaction of SO 2 with Pd, which is known as sulfur poisoning, produces inactive palladium sulfur oxide species (Pd(SO x )), which significantly decreases the overall catalytic activity of the catalyst [11]. Various researchers have found that adding Pt or Zr to Pd-containing catalysts improved the sulfur tolerance of the material. For example, Corro et al. established that Pt(0), in a reduced Pd-Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, reacted more quickly with SO 2 than Pd, freeing the Pd to react with methane [11]. Another recent study proposed that adding Pt would improve the activity of a Pd-modified Mn-hexaaluminate catalyst for the oxidation of methane, even in the presence of SO 2 and water [16]. The authors related the improved water and sulfur resistance to the presence of Pt-Pd alloy particles.",
                "Venezia et al. [17] found that a mesoporous SBA-15-supported Pd catalyst with 10% wt% TiO 2 added to the SBA-15 significantly improved the catalyst activity and sulfur tolerance compared to Pd loaded on SBA-15 alone. The increased sulfur tolerance was attributed to the scavenging effect of TiO 2 on SO 2 , thus allowing Pd to stay unchanged for the reaction with methane. However, the addition of titania to silica increased the acidity of the support. As a result, the scavenger action of titania could be substantially decreased due to the stronger water adsorption on the acidic sites. For that reason, it would be interesting to modify the catalyst with more basic zirconia, which would interact much stronger with SO 2 molecules. Escandon et al. [18] showed higher sulfur resistance of Pd supported on zirconia; however, zirconia provides much less surface area for dispersion of active metals compared to alumina or silica. Therefore, in summary, we can expect a synergetic effect for enhanced catalytic performance by using a combination of Pd active metal with Pt supported on high surface area silica (SBA-15), which is promoted by zirconia.",
                "The objective of this study was to develop a novel methane oxidation catalyst with hydrothermal stability and sulfur-resistant properties by adding Zr to Pd/Pt/SBA-15 catalyst. To this aim, mesoporous SBA-15 was modified by the addition of Zr (5, 10, and 15 wt%) followed by loading with 2 wt% Pd and 4 wt% Pt. We used a relatively high content of Pd and Pt (total, 6 wt%) despite the current trend of lowering the cost of catalysts by reducing the amount of precious metals. This was done to ensure that sufficient methane conversion and stability would be achieved under typical lean burn NGV exhaust conditions, that contain water vapor, sulfur compounds, and temperatures of 250-600 \u2022 C. Velin et al. [19], for example, showed that a catalyst required at least 3.6 wt% Pd on alumina to achieve a T 50 near 400 \u2022 C in a feed that contained water without sulfur, which also negatively affects catalyst activity.",
                "The catalysts were characterized using various techniques (BET, XRD, TPR, XPS) to establish a correlation between the physico-chemical properties of the materials and their performance in the complete oxidation of methane. Fresh and aged catalysts were tested for methane oxidation activity under conditions with the same simulated NGV exhaust that contained water vapor and sulfur in the stream."

The data show that the amounts of main components of calcined materials were very close to the intended nominal values for most elements. A few results differ from the nominal values by approximately 25% but are still close enough to indicate that the metals were loaded onto the SBA-15 in the intended amounts. "

                        "The adsorption/desorption isotherms of pure SBA-15 support, and the catalysts loaded with Pd, Pt, and zirconia are shown in Figure 1. The isotherm of SBA-15 was typical for samples with type IVa mesoporous materials and some micropores according to the IUPAC classification. The catalysts also demonstrated type IVa mesoporous material isotherms, indicating that loading the metals did not destroy the mesoporous structure of SBA-15 [20]. The hysteresis loops presented H1 types, indicating mesoporous materials with tube-shaped channels open at both ends [21]. Nitrogen sorption (Figure 1) showed a decrease in the total volume of nitrogen adsorbed with increased loading of Pd, Pt, and Zr, indicating an increase in filling of the pores of the support by added metal compounds. This finding was also reported by Adrover et al. [22]. The pore size distribution chart (Figure 2) shows that adding Pd and Pt to SBA-15 led to the formation of catalysts with bimodal pore size distribution and a maximum size of 3.8 and 5.6 nm. Furthermore, the addition of these two metals narrowed the distribution range of the largest pore size, suggesting filling of the SBA-15 mesopores. It can also be seen that increased Zr content (from 5 to 15 wt%) reduced the overall large pore size volume (5.6 nm), but at the same time, the smallest pore size volume (3.8 nm) stayed constant for all catalysts with the three components (Pd, Pt, and Zr). Thus, it appears that the metals first filled in the mesopores, obstructing them, and then formed new pores of 3.8 nm. A similar result was obtained by Hassan et al. [23], who showed that a new smaller pore range was formed with increasing content of Co loaded on SBA-15. Table 2 lists the structural properties of the catalysts. The surface area decreased as the loading of metal increased, from 836 m 2 /g for pure SBA-15 to 432 m 2 /g for 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15. As expected, the pore volume also decreased, from 0.82 cm 3 /g for SBA-15 to 0.59 cm 3 /g for 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15, confirming that the three metals indeed filled the SBA-15 pores. "

                        "Figure 3 shows the diffractograms of 2Pd/4Pt/xZr/SBA-15 catalysts with and without Zr. The amorphous portion of SBA-15 was found between 20 and 30 \u2022 2\u03b8. In the samples with 10 and 15 wt% Zr, tetragonal zirconia was the major phase, as indicated by a characteristic peak at 2\u03b8 = 30.2 \u2022 , which corresponds to the (111) reflection, and peaks at 50.3 \u2022 and 60.0 \u2022 , which are the (220) and (311) reflections, related to tetragonal zirconia (PDF 01-070-8758). These lines cannot be seen in the sample containing 5% Zr because the low amount of zirconia cannot be detected by XRD. However, it was expected that tetragonal zirconia would be the major phase in this sample, since it was prepared under the same conditions as the other two. For all catalysts, metallic face centered cubic platinum Pt was identified with peaks at 2\u03b8 = 39.7 \u2022 , 46.2 \u2022 , 67.4 \u2022 , and 82.3 \u2022 , corresponding to the (111), ( 200), (220), and (311) reflections, respectively [24]. PdO appeared to be the only Pd phase in all catalysts, as indicated by the ( 101) and (110) reflections at 2\u03b8 = 33.8 \u2022 and 42.0 \u2022 , and all reflections for pure Pd were not detected. In all samples, there was no indication of a Pd-Pt alloy, which typically forms when both Pt and Pd are added to a support and calcined. The formation of this alloy is dependent on the calcination conditions. For example, a calcination temperature as low as 300 \u2022 C for the formation of the alloy has been reported in the literature. However, the alloy was formed only after reduction with hydrogen [25]. On the other hand, other authors have indicated that temperatures above 500 \u2022 C are required to form the Pd-Pt alloy.",
                        "In the current study, the main reflections of the Pd-Pt alloy of (111) at 2\u03b8 = 39.97 \u2022 , (200) at 2\u03b8 = 46.49, and (220) at 2\u03b8 = 67.86 \u2022 were not detected in any diffractograms of the catalysts. Overall, the XRD results suggest that PdO and Pt are separate components and that no alloy is formed under the conditions used for catalyst preparation.",
                        "The Sherrer equation was used to calculate particle size, and the values are shown in Table 2. The crystallite size of Pt was found to be larger than that of PdO overall, and this may be due to its higher concentration and the extra calcination step after loading Pd, both of which favor particle sintering. Furthermore, it can be seen that the Pt particles increased in size with Zr content."

                        "XPS analysis was performed on fresh Pd-Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15 doped with different concentrations of Zr. Figure 4 shows the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the three fresh catalysts of the series. The analysis of peak Gaussian fitting revealed the presence of three Pd 3d 5/2 peaks at BE between 334.50 and 334.52, 335.9 and 336.09, and 338.03 and 338.45 eV and three Pd 3d 3/2 peaks at BE between 339.79 and 340.81, 341.19 and 341.30, and 343.32 and 343.74 eV, which can be assigned to Pd 0 , Pd 2+ , and Pd 4+ species, respectively (Figure 4). The relative concentrations of the Pd in the three oxidation states obtained from deconvolution of the XPS spectra are shown in Table 3. It was found that the surface content of each Pd species was similar for the three catalysts and was composed mostly of Pd 2+ (80-85%) and Pd 4+ (13-16%), with a small amount of metallic Pd (3-5%). Overlapping Zr 3p peaks with Pd 3d were found at 350-345 and 335-325 eV. As expected, their peak height rose proportionally with the increasing amount of Zr in the catalysts.  The XPS Pt 4f spectra for all catalysts are displayed in Figure 5. The spectra of 2Pd/4Pt/5Zr/SBA-15 and 2Pd/4Pt/10Zr/SBA-15 are very similar. They both show doublets, which were assigned to Pt(0) 4f 7/2 and 4f 5/2 at 71.2 and 74.5 eV, respectively. It can be seen in Table 3 that catalysts containing 5 and 10 wt% Zr had metallic Pt as the dominant species (>90%), with Pt 2+ accounting for 6-7%, and almost no Pt 4+ was detected (\u22640.38%).",
                        "On the other hand, the Pt 4f spectrum of 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 did not show a welldefined peak shape due to the presence of different amounts of Pt in the three oxidation states. The distribution of the same species in this sample was significantly different, showing 27.3% Pt 0 , 43.6% Pt 2+ , and 29.1% Pt 4+ . Thus, the XPS analysis revealed that the main difference between the three catalysts was that the highest amount of Pt 4+ and Pt 2+ was found in the 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 sample (43.6% Pt 2+ and 29.1% Pt 4+ ), compared to less than 7% Pt 2+ and 0.38% Pt 4+ in the other two catalysts (Table 3). The role of zirconia and other supports in stabilizing the high-oxidation states of Pt were discussed in previous studies [26,27]. It has been suggested that the mechanism of stabilization is an interaction between Pt and the support, resulting in the formation of new binary oxides composed of platinum and support cations. Based on this, we can presume that Zr plays a determinative role in the formation and stabilization of Pt in high-oxidation states, and the effect of Zr was the most pronounced with 15 wt% Zr. In a study by Torralba et al. [28], the authors showed that highly oxidized Pt was stabilized by zirconia and enhanced catalytic activity for methane oxidation. On the other hand, the Pt 4f spectrum of 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 did not show a we defined peak shape due to the presence of different amounts of Pt in the three oxidati states. The distribution of the same species in this sample was significantly differen showing 27.3% Pt 0 , 43.6% Pt 2+ , and 29.1% Pt 4+ .

                        "The reducibility of the prepared catalysts was characterized by H 2 -TPR experiments. To facilitate the identification of TPR peaks, pure SBA-15, zirconia-supported SBA-15, and monometallic Pd or Pt on SBA-15 were tested under the same conditions as 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/ SBA-15. Figure 6 shows the H 2 consumption curves of the prepared samples. Curves a and b (SBA-15 and 15Zr/SBA-15, respectively) show no H 2 consumption peaks, indicating that there was no reduction of the bare or Zr-doped silica supports. As such, the observed hydrogen consumption peaks in the TPR curves of other catalysts correspond to the reduction of supported Pd and Pt. Curve c (4Pt/SBA-15) shows a large H 2 consumption peak centered at 480 \u2022 C, which can be attributed to the reduction of PtO x at high temperature, indicating a strong interaction of Pt with the support [30,31]. When Pt was loaded on the Zr-doped silica (curve d), the TPR profile was markedly different, demonstrating two overlapping peaks centered at 360 and 480 \u2022 C, suggesting the existence of weakly and strongly bound PtO x to the support, respectively [31]. The addition of Zr to silica led to a new reduction peak at low temperature, clearly indicating the involvement of zirconia in the formation of more reducible PtO x species in the catalyst. This observation agrees with [32], which demonstrated a low-temperature reduction peak at near 325 \u2022 C assigned to PtO x species bound to zirconia. When 2 wt% Pd was loaded on SBA-15 and 15Zr/SBA-15 (curves e and f, respectively), the negative peak at 78 \u2022 C indicates the release of H 2 from PdH x species that formed at lower temperatures [33]. In addition, there was no significant change in the TPR profiles of these catalysts, indicating that Zr addition did not influence the reducibility of Pd in the catalysts.",
                        "For the bimetallic Pd-Pt/SBA-15 catalyst without Zr (curve g), the H 2 reduction peak for Pd at 78 \u2022 C was significantly reduced, indicating decreased formation of hydrides, which agrees with Radlik and Noh et al. [34,35], who determined that Pt impeded the formation of Pd hydrides. Furthermore, the peak temperatures and shapes in curve g were very similar to the individual peaks found in the TPR profiles of monometallic 4Pt/SBA-15 and 2Pd/15Zr/SBA-15 (curves c and f, respectively). As such, there was no apparent change in the reducibility of Pt and Pd when they were loaded together on the same support to form the bimetallic catalyst. Curve h shows the TPR curve of 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15, which shows no change in the Pd reduction peak. The profile also shows the same two H 2 uptake peaks for Pt at 360 and 480 \u2022 C as in curve d (TPR of 4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15), confirming the same effect of zirconia on Pt reducibility irrespective of whether both metals were loaded on the support or not.",
                        "Finally, a comparison of the TPR profiles of the three catalysts with varying amounts of dopant (5, 10, and 15 wt% Zr) is shown in Figure 7. All three catalysts exhibited H 2 consumption peaks at 360 and 480 \u2022 C, indicating that they all had weakly and strongly bound PtO x species. Table 4 shows the H 2 uptake of Pt of the three catalysts, and it can be seen that the H 2 quantity increased for Pt associated with a peak at 360 \u2022 C with zirconia content from 5 to 15 wt%. This result indicates that zirconia clearly influenced the formation of more reducible PtO x species, and the amounts of these species correlated with the Zr content. At the same time, there was no noticeable trend in H 2 uptake for the higher temperature peak of 460 \u2022 C with Zr content in all three catalysts.",
                        "Based on the analysis of TPR data, we can conclude that the additional H 2 consumption peak at a low temperature of 360 \u2022 C was a result of the interaction of zirconia with Pt and reflected the increased reducibility of modified vs. unmodified catalysts. Furthermore, the H 2 uptake at the 360 \u2022 C peak was the highest for the 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 catalyst, correlating with the largest amount of interacting interface between Pt and ZrO 2 . The better reducibility of Pt in close proximity to zirconia could make its bonding of hydrogen and methane and the sequential breaking of the C-H bond easier, which is the rate-limiting step in the oxidation of methane [36]. Taking this into consideration, we can suppose that 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 would be the most active catalyst for methane oxidation.  "

                        "The effect of adding Zr to Pd-Pt-SBA-15 catalysts on methane oxidation activity was studied in a fixed-bed reactor using simulated NG exhaust. The fresh catalysts were tested, and their gradient runs are shown in Figure 8. When fresh, the catalyst without Zr (2Pd/4Pt/SBA-15) showed the lowest activity in terms of the highest T 50 , but it was similar to the one containing 5 wt% Zr. Furthermore, an increase in activity was observed when the Zr content was increased to 10 and 15 wt% compared to the catalysts with 0 and 5 wt% Zr. The catalysts were then aged for 40 h at 500 \u2022 C using simulated lean burn NG exhaust, which included water vapor and sulfur dioxide. Figure 9 shows the changes of CH 4 conversion with time during aging. The curves for all catalysts show a sudden drop in conversion at the initial stage, which can be explained by the strong adsorption of SO 2 on the active metal sites decreasing their activity for methane oxidation. After approximately 20 min, the catalysts with 10 and 15 wt% Zr demonstrated almost no decrease in methane conversion, suggesting that the continued sulfur adsorption on the zirconia protected the remaining active sites from being blocked. For example, the methane conversion of 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 was at 88% at the beginning of the aging procedure, then dropped to 60% in the first 20 min and stayed constant at this value for 40 h. The same tendency was found for 2Pd/4Pt/10Zr/SBA-15, showing an initial CH 4 conversion near 83% and then dropping to 60% after one hour, with a slight reduction in conversion near 55% after 40 h. On other hand, the catalysts with no Zr (2Pd/4Pt/SBA-15) exhibited only 55% CH 4 conversion at the starting point, then reduced to 30% conversion after 40 h. The catalyst that contained 5 wt% Zr showed slightly better performance than 2Pd/4Pt/SBA-15 throughout the aging process (~3% higher CH 4 conversion) due to the presence of Zr. The aged catalysts were further evaluated for methane oxidation activity with gradient runs to determine their T 50 . Figure 10 shows the light-off curves of catalysts after aging, and Table 5 presents a comparison of T 50 values between fresh and aged catalysts. The curve for 2Pd4Pt/SBA-15 shows an extensive loss of activity, as the catalyst did not even reach 100% methane conversion at 600 \u2022 C. Furthermore, it exhibits a T 50 of 581 \u2022 C, with a difference of 194 \u2022 C between fresh and aged catalysts, indicating low stability. On the other hand, the Zr-containing catalysts had much lower T 50 , between 481 and 502 \u2022 C, and a much smaller difference in T 50 (less than 121 \u2022 C) between fresh and aged, confirming the better stability of the modified catalysts.",
                        "From the literature [18], it is known that Pd catalysts with sulfatable supports, such as zirconia and alumina, are more resistant to sulfur poisoning because the support acts as a trap for the sulfur species, thereby protecting Pd active sites from poisoning. Since SBA-15 is a silica support, it is non-sulfating, and the active metals can be easily deactivated by sulfur. When Zr was added to SBA-15, the catalysts became more active and stable. This is well demonstrated by the activity of 2Pd/4Pt/SBA-15, which was lower in comparison to the three modified catalysts. Thus, the overall activity and aging results suggest that Zr on silica acts as a sulfur sink and prevents the sulfur poisoning of Pd and Pt, which enhances catalyst activity and stability.  The graph in Figure 11 provides some insight into the poisoning effect of sulfur on the catalysts. The graph shows the concentration of SO 2 at the outlet of the reactor, which was measured during the gradient runs after aging. The least active catalyst of the series, 2Pd/4Pt/SBA-15, showed no major change with the initial SO 2 concentration of 12 ppm during the run until around 400 \u2022 C, when the concentration decreased significantly. SBA-15, as a non-sulfating silica support, did not bond with sulfur at lower temperatures and the outlet SO 2 concentration was not affected. As the temperature increased, the SO 2 concentration decreased, suggesting that SO 2 was trapped on the Pd surface, thus poisoning the catalyst and reducing its activity. On the contrary, the catalysts with Zr all exhibited low SO 2 concentrations of 2-4 ppm at the beginning of the gradient runs, suggesting that the sulfur bound immediately to the zirconium sulfating support. The catalysts with 10 and 15 wt% Zr, which were the most active of the series, had the lowest concentrations of SO 2 at the beginning of the gradient runs, indicating that more SO 2 was bound on their surface, thus protecting the Pd. As the temperature increased, the concentration of SO 2 increased slightly, suggesting a partial release of the bound sulfur from the catalyst.",
                        "Additionally, according to the XPS data, 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr demonstrated the highest content of Pt 2+ and Pt 4+ . This may be another reason for the high activity of this catalyst, as these Pt electric dipole sites exert a strong polarization effect on CH 4 molecules. This polarization causes a weakening of the C-H bond, which in turn facilitates the removal of the first hydrogen atom from the adsorbed methane molecule, which represents the rate-limiting step in the oxidation process [28]. These results clearly show that zirconia and platinum play an important role in the catalyst activity, stability, and resistance to sulfur poisoning of methane oxidation catalysts. "

                "SBA-15 was doped with various amounts of zirconia (5, 10, and 15 wt%) and impregnated with Pd and Pt (2 and 4 wt%, respectively). XRD analysis revealed that the catalyst contained individual PdO and Pt particles with apparently no alloy formation between Pd and Pt and identified a tetragonal zirconia phase. Among the series of catalysts, the 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 catalyst, with the highest Zr concentration of 15 wt%, was the most active, stable, and sulfur resistant, as demonstrated by the lowest T 50 of 481 \u2022 C after 40 h of aging. The increased performance and stability of this catalyst was attributed to the higher content of reducible Pt species as well as the Zr trapping capacity of sulfur, which provides protection for the active metals. The results of this study indicate that 2Pd/4Pt/15Zr/SBA-15 catalyst may be a good candidate for practical application in reducing methane slip from lean burn natural gas engines."
