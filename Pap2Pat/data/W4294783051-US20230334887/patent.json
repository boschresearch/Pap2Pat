                                "Various embodiments of the present disclosure make important technical contributions to improving predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and speed of machine learning language models by assessing the influence of blocks of text on the probability of a document being assigned a given classification label, which in turn improves training speed and training efficiency of training predictive machine learning models. It is well-understood in the relevant art that there is typically a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and training speed, such that it is trivial to improve training speed by reducing predictive accuracy, and thus the real challenge is to improve training speed without sacrificing predictive accuracy through innovative model architectures, see, e.g., Sun et al., Feature-Frequency-Adaptive On-line Training for Fast and Accurate Natural Language Processing in 40(3) Computational Linguistic 563 at Abst. (\u201cTypically, we need to make a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. It is trivial to improve the training speed via sacrificing accuracy or to improve the accuracy via sacrificing speed. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to improve the training speed and the accuracy at the same time\u201d). Accordingly, techniques that improve predictive accuracy without harming training speed, such as the techniques described herein, enable improving training speed given a constant predictive accuracy. In doing so, the techniques described herein improve efficiency and speed of training predictive machine learning models, thus reducing the number of computational operations needed and/or the amount of training data entries needed to train predictive machine learning models. Accordingly, the techniques described herein improve at least one of the computational efficiency, storage-wise efficiency, and speed of training predictive machine learning models.",
                                "For example, various embodiments of the present disclosure improve document classification using machine learning by analyzing multiple text blocks of a document of size K and assigning a probability for each evaluation. As an example, language machine learning models that use sparse attention mechanisms generally do not compare every token to every token during training, and because not every token attends to every other token, natively within the language machine learning model, there are not weights for every pair of tokens to represent how important a given pair of token is to classification. Various embodiments of the present disclosure approximates self-attention by analyzing groups of tokens, which are generally more informative than individual tokens. As described herein, existing natural language processing techniques focus on individual words or tokens, and are prohibitively expensive in terms of runtime and are not well-suited for long documents, as runtime grows quadratically with the length of the document for these existing techniques. Additionally, existing methods do not provide measures of statistical significance and fail to surface informative explanations of predictions on documents.",
                                "However, in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure, a predictive data analysis computing entity may be configured to generate predictive data output that includes blocks of text (text blocks) determined to be most influential on the probability of a document being assigned a given classification label by masking many text blocks of size K tokens at once with probability P. Additionally, in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure the expected number of times a given text block is masked (e.g., expected text block masking count J) and the impact of each text block on each classification label prediction from performing a required number of classification routine iterations N (where N=J/P) enables the number of evaluations and/or operations required by various embodiments of the present disclosure to be independent of document length. In doing so, the techniques described herein improve efficiency and speed of predictive systems for predictive systems machine learning models, thus reducing the number of computational operations needed and/or the amount of training data entries needed to train predictive machine learning models. Accordingly, the techniques described herein improve at least one of the computational efficiency, storage-wise efficiency, and speed of training predictive machine learning models."

As described herein, existing natural language processing techniques focus on individual words or tokens, are prohibitively expensive in terms of runtime and are not well-suited for long documents, as runtime grows quadratically with the length of the document for these existing techniques. Additionally, existing methods do not provide measures of statistical significance and fail to surface clinically informative explanations of predictions from, for example, medical documents.",

It is well-understood in the relevant art that there is typically a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and training speed, such that it is trivial to improve training speed by reducing predictive accuracy, and thus the real challenge is to improve training speed without sacrificing predictive accuracy through innovative model architectures, see, e.g., Sun et al., Feature-Frequency-Adaptive On-line Training for Fast and Accurate Natural Language Processing in 40(3) Computational Linguistic 563 at Abst. (\u201cTypically, we need to make a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. It is trivial to improve the training speed via sacrificing accuracy or to improve the accuracy via sacrificing speed. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to improve the training speed and the accuracy at the same time\u201d). Accordingly, techniques that improve predictive accuracy without harming training speed, such as the techniques described herein, enable improving training speed given a constant predictive accuracy. In doing so, the techniques described herein improve efficiency and speed of training predictive machine learning models, thus reducing the number of computational operations needed and/or the amount of training data entries needed to train predictive machine learning models. Accordingly, the techniques described herein improve at least one of the computational efficiency, storage-wise efficiency, and speed of training predictive machine learning models.",

It is well-understood in the relevant art that there is typically a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and training speed, such that it is trivial to improve training speed by reducing predictive accuracy, and thus the real challenge is to improve training speed without sacrificing predictive accuracy through innovative model architectures, see, e.g., Sun et al., Feature-Frequency-Adaptive On-line Training for Fast and Accurate Natural Language Processing in 40(3) Computational Linguistic 563 at Abst. (\u201cTypically, we need to make a tradeoff between speed and accuracy. It is trivial to improve the training speed via sacrificing accuracy or to improve the accuracy via sacrificing speed. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to improve the training speed and the accuracy at the same time\u201d). Accordingly, techniques that improve predictive accuracy without harming training speed, such as the techniques described herein, enable improving training speed given a constant predictive accuracy. In doing so, the techniques described herein improve efficiency and speed of training predictive machine learning models, thus reducing the number of computational operations needed and/or the amount of training data entries needed to train predictive machine learning models. Accordingly, the techniques described herein improve at least one of the computational efficiency, storage-wise efficiency, and speed of training predictive machine learning models."
