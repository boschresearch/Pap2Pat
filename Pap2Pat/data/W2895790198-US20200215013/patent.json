                        "Epilepsy covers a broad range of neurological disorders that are characterised by seizures. Seizures result from abnormal neuronal activity and manifest in a number of ways, including convulsions and loss of awareness. In many cases epilepsy can be managed by the use of anti-convulsive medication. However for a proportion of patients with epilepsy, treatment with conventional drugs can have minimal effect upon seizure activity. Although surgery is an option for treating patients suffering from certain seizures, for many individuals successful management can be achieved less invasively with the ketogenic diet.",
                        "The medium chain triglyceride (MCT) ketogenic diet was first identified as a treatment for refractory epilepsy in 1971. It has provided one of the most effective therapeutic approaches for children with drug resistant epilepsy (Liu, Epilepsia 2008; 49 Suppl. 8: 33-36) and has been demonstrated to be effective in childhood epilepsy in a randomised control trial (Neal et al., Epilepsia 2009; 50: 1109-1117). However, the diet has adverse gastro-intestinal related side effects, such as diarrhea, vomiting, bloating, and cramps (Liu, Epilepsia 2008; 49 Suppl 8: 33-36.). Furthermore, it has also been shown that there is a high attrition rate for the diet, due to many patients finding the diet difficult to tolerate (Levy et al., Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012; 3: CD001903).",
                        "Although ketone bodies resulting from the ketogenic diet have been postulated to play a therapeutic role, seizure control is poorly correlated with ketone body levels (Likhodii et al., Epilepsia 2000; 41: 1400-1410; Thavendiranathan et al., Exp Neurol 2000; 161: 696-703). In addition to ketones, the diet also causes an increase in plasma levels of the two fatty acids provided in MCT oil, the straight chain, ten carbon decanoic acid, and the eight carbon octanoic acid (Haidukewych et al., Clin Chem 1982; 28: 642-645). Recently, it has been established that decanoic acid, but not octanoic acid, has anti-seizure effects at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro and in vivo (Chang et al., Neuropharmacology 2013; 69: 105-114; Wlaz et al., Progress in Neuropsychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 2014). \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA receptors) play a key role in generating and propagating epileptic activity and in the long-term, adaptive cellular plasticity associated with epileptogenesis (Chapman, J Nutr 2000; 130: 1043S-1045S; Rogawski and Donevan, Adv Neurol 1999; 79: 947-963). The receptors are present in all areas relevant to epilepsy, including the cerebral cortex, amygdala, thalamus and hippocampus. Furthermore, AMPA receptor antagonists have a broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity in various in vitro and in vivo epilepsy models (Rogawski., Epilepsy Curr 2011; 11: 56-63).",
                        "We have recently demonstrated that decanoic acid inhibits AMPA receptors (Chang et al., Brain. 2016 February; 139(2): 431-443).",
                        "Perampanel (Fycompa) is a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist which has been licensed as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset and primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (Frampton J E. 2015. Drugs 75: 1657-68). Adjunctive perampanel has also been found to be effective in children with refractory partial-onset seizures and for tonic-clonic seizures in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (Heyman E. Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology 2017, 59: 441-444). However, it has dose-dependent behavioural side-effects, limiting its use in some patients (Rugg-Gunn F. 2014. Epilepsia 55 Suppl 1: 13-5).",
                        "The most common side-effects reported in patients receiving perampanel have been dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, irritability, nausea and falls, but of particular concern to patients were the cognitive and psychiatric side effects of the drug. Rugg-Gunn F. describes how overall, depression and aggression were reported more frequently in patients taking perampanel, particularly at higher doses, than in patients taking placebo. Heyman E. reports that perampanel is associated with a relatively high rate of behavioural adverse effects mostly in adolescents with refractory epilepsy.",

ALS may be inherited or sporadic. Typically, patients with ALS die from progressive respiratory muscle paralysis within a few years after disease onset. Excitotoxicity, a pathological process in which neurons are damaged and killed by over-activity of AMPA receptors, has been proposed to underlie ALS pathogenesis. Orally administered perampanel prevented the progression of the ALS phenotype in a mouse model of ALS (Akamatsu et al., Sci. Rep (2017) 6:28649).

Cancer Biol Ther, 2015. 16(8): p. 1205-13), and inhibition of AMPA receptors suppresses migration and proliferation of glioblastoma multiforme cells (GBM) (Ishiuchi, S., et al., Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors regulate growth of human glioblastoma via Akt activation.

                                "There is strong evidence that amyloid \u03b2(A\u03b2) increases AMPA receptor currents and triggers subunit internalization, a theory that directly links glutamate receptor hyperactivity to neurotoxicity and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. A\u03b2 has been shown to interact with \u03b2 adrenergic receptors which regulate gene expression and the activity of various receptors including AMPA-type glutamate receptors via the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade (Wang, D., et al., Binding of amyloid beta peptide to beta2 adrenergic receptor induces PKA-dependent AMPA receptor hyperactivity. FASEB J, 2010. 24(9): p. 3511-21, Wisely, E. V., Y. K. Xiang, and S. Oddo, Genetic suppression of beta2-adrenergic receptors ameliorates tau pathology in a mouse model of tauopathies. Hum Mol Genet, 2014. 23(15): p. 4024-34). Phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits by PKA has been shown to increase channel opening probability which results in augmented calcium entry into the cell (Banke, T. G., et al., Control of GluR1 AMPA receptor function by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. J Neurosci, 2000. 20(1): p. 89-102). Indeed, numerous studies have shown that the addition of A\u03b2 to neuronal cultures causes neurotoxicity by strengthening calcium-dependent AMPA-receptor generated currents (Whitcomb, D. J., et al., Intracellular oligomeric amyloid-beta rapidly regulates GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptor in the hippocampus. Sci Rep, 2015. 5: p. 10934). This suggests that A\u03b2 induced excitotoxicity could contribute to the widespread neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to ketones providing energy to glucose resistant neurons, the MCT ketogenic diet might therefore improve neuronal survival through the inhibition of AMPA receptors by decanoic acid. In addition, there is evidence that A\u03b2 treatment triggers the internalization of GluA2 subunits, the only AMPA receptor subunit type that confers calcium impermeability. Internalization of GluA2 could therefore further increase total calcium influx at the post-synapse which could further increase inflammation and neurotoxicity (Beppu, K., et al., Expression, subunit composition, and function of AMPA-type glutamate receptors are changed in activated microglia; possible contribution of GluA2 (GluR-B)-deficiency under pathological conditions.

                                "We first determined the effect of perampanel on currents elicited by glutamate (100 \u03bcM) application to Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing GluA1/2 or 2/3, the two most common AMPA receptor subunit combinations found in the hippocampus (Jacob and Weinberg, 2015. Hippocampus 25: 798-812). Perampanel inhibited AMPA receptor currents with an IC50 value of 1.51 \u03bcM against GluA2/3 (CI 0.96 to 2.37) and 1.12 \u03bcM against GluA1/2 (CI 0.79 to 1.58) (FIG. 1A,B). In addition, perampanel inhibited AMPA receptor currents in a non-competitive manner, with increasing glutamate concentrations not reversing perampanel inhibition (FIG. 1C). Perampanel also reduced glutamate evoked maximal responses to 75.2% (at 2.5 \u03bcM) and 16.9% (at 5 \u03bcM). These data directly show, for the first time, the inhibition of AMPA receptors by perampanel through a non-competitive inhibition without subunit specificity.",
                                "Recent studies have suggested distinct binding sites for perampanel and decanoic acid on the AMPA receptor (Chang P, Augustin K, Boddum K, Williams S, Sun M, et al. 2016. Brain 139: 431-43; Yelshanskaya M V, Singh A K, Sampson J M, Narangoda C, Kurnikova M, Sobolevsky A I. 2016. Neuron 91: 1305-15). Perampanel and related compounds have been suggested to bind at the S1-M1 and S2-M4 linker between transmembrane and extracellular domains (Yelshanskaya M V, Singh A K, Sampson J M, Narangoda C, Kurnikova M, Sobolevsky A I. 2016. Neuron 91: 1305-15). In contrast, decanoic acid modelling suggests binding to the M3 region (Chang P, Augustin K, Boddum K, Williams S, Sun M, et al. 2016. Brain 139: 431-43). To confirm this, we expressed a GYKI resistant subunit GluA3 mutant (11) and assessed it for sensitivity to perampanel and decanoic acid (FIG. 1C). Perampanel (20 \u03bcM) reduced the wild type AMPA receptor (GluA3) glutamate-induced currents by 94.7%, but the mutant receptor by only 54.3% (p<0.0001). In contrast, decanoic acid (1 mM) reduced wild type and mutant glutamate-induced currents by 74.5% (SEM 6.4) and 72.8% (SEM 0.3) respectively, strongly supporting that decanoic acid interacts with AMPA receptors at a different site.",
                                "To investigate the possibility of synergism between decanoic acid and perampanel, we tested AMPA receptor (GluA2/3) sensitivity to decanoic acid within the concentration range observed in patients receiving the MCT ketogenic diet (12), at two concentrations of perampanel (1 \u03bcM and 4 \u03bcM) (FIG. 1E,F). In these experiments, decanoic acid potency was increased by perampanel, lowering IC50 for GluA2/3 from 0.52 mM (in the absence of perampanel) to 0.10 mM or 0.04 mM in the presence of 1 \u03bcM or 4 \u03bcM perampanel respectively (p<0.0001). This effect was also observed in GluA1/2 AMPA receptors (FIG. 1G), the decanoic acid IC50 for GluA1/2 was reduced from 0.92 mM (in the absence of perampanel) to 0.21 mM and 0.09 mM in the presence of 1 \u03bcM or 4 \u03bcM respectively (p<0.0001). Repeating this approach using perampanel with two concentrations of decanoic acid (50 mM and 100 mM) (FIG. 1H, I, J), also showed a significant increase in the potency of perampanel, decreasing IC50 values from 5.1 \u03bcM (in the absence of DA) to 1.7 \u03bcM and 1.6 \u03bcM in the presence of DA at 50 mM and 100 mM respectively in GluA2/3 and from 6.2 \u03bcM in GluA1/2 to 2.1 \u03bcM and 2.2 \u03bcM, respectively (both p<0.0001). These results imply synergistic inhibition of AMPA receptors by decanoic acid and perampanel."

In these experiments, increasing concentrations of decanoic acid reduced epileptiform activity at 300 \u03bcM with a block at 1000 \u03bcM (FIG. 3A), consistent with earlier data (Chang P, Augustin K, Boddum K, Williams S, Sun M, et al. 2016.

Modelling these data shows that decanoic acid (10 \u03bcM) combined with perampanel (100 nM) caused a significant reduction in seizure activity from 95.6% (CI 80.8 to 110.4) in the absence of decanoic acid to 76.8% (CI 63.1 to 90.4, p=0.048) in its presence, and a block in activity at 600 \u03bcM. A similar activity is also shown at higher perampanel (500 nM) concentrations, reducing baseline (10 \u03bcM) inhibition to 69.6% (CI 53.1 to 86, p=0.015). These data also demonstrate a reduced IC50 for decanoic acid from 352 \u03bcM (CI: 200.1 to 621.5) to 196 \u03bcM (145.2 to 264.8) and 122 \u03bcM (49.13 to 302.9, p=0.0252) at 100 nM and 500 nM respectively."

Data provided here illustrate a significant \u02dc3-fold reduction in the IC50 value for perampanel against the two most common AMPA receptor subunit combinations (GluA2/3 and GluA1/2) demonstrating a direct synergistic inhibition of these receptors at a molecular level. We show that the synergistic effects of combinatory treatment is also evident in an ex vivo seizure model, where epileptiform activity is induced by application of PTZ.",
                        "Potential synergistic effects between perampanel and decanoic acid depend on suitable levels of each compound. In early studies on the levels of medium chain fatty acids in the peripheral blood of patients on the MCT ketogenic diet, the concentration of decanoic acid blood is around 87 to 552 \u03bcM with an average of 157 \u03bcM (Haidukewych D, Forsythe W I, Sills M. 1982. Clin Chem 28: 642-5; Sills M A, Forsythe W I, Haidukewych D. 1986. Arch Dis Child 61: 1173-7).",

Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 57: 110-6). Extrapolating this ratio to human brain suggests that decanoic acid is likely to be present in the brain at average concentrations of around 110 \u03bcM. Our data suggests that 100 \u03bcM decanoic acid results in a 3-fold increase in the inhibition of the AMPA receptor by perampanel which translates to an even greater impact on seizure activity.",
                        "These data support the potential clinical relevance of this synergistic effect in patients. This may provide a means for reducing the side effect profile of perampanel or cause a significant improvement in treating diseases in which inhibition of AMPA receptors is beneficial, such as the treatment of seizure control. The synergistic inhibition of AMPA receptors through combinatory perampanel and decanoic acid may therefore provide both improved treatment and reduced side effects in patient populations. Given the concerning side effects of perampanel, particularly the cognitive and psychiatric side effects observed at higher doses reported by Rugg-Gunn, F. in Epilepsia. 2014 January; 55 Suppl 1:13-5, this is a significant advantage of the present invention. The inventors believe that the combination of decanoic acid and perampanel (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) may allow the use of lower doses of perampanel in the treatment of epilepsy and thereby reduce severity and/or prevalence of its side-effects."

A method for treating epilepsy comprising administering a composition comprising decanoic acid in combination with perampanel, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or an AMPA receptor inhibitor that binds to the same AMPA receptor site as perampanel to an individual in need of same.",
        "2. A method for treating epilepsy comprising administering perampanel or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof combination with decanoic acid to an individual in need of same.",
        "3. A method for use in treating epilepsy comprising administering an AMPA receptor inhibitor that binds to the same AMPA receptor site as perampanel in combination with decanoic acid to an individual in need of same.",
        "4. Method according to claim 1, wherein the decanoic acid, and the perampanel, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are administered separately or sequentially, or wherein the decanoic acid and the AMPA receptor inhibitor are administered separately or sequentially.",
        "5-9. (canceled)",
        "10. Method according to claim 4, wherein the use is for treating a subject that has been identified as a subject that would respond to AMPA receptor inhibition.",
        "11. Method according to claim 1, wherein the decanoic acid is in the form of a triglyceride.",
        "12. Method according to claim 1, wherein the decanoic acid is comprised in an oil-in-water emulsion, a powder or a food stuff.",
        "13. Method according to claim 1, wherein the decanoic acid is comprised within a medical food, a tube feed, a nutritional composition or a nutritional supplement.",
        "14. Method according to claim 1, wherein the composition further comprises one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluents and/or excipients.",
