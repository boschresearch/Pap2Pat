    "title": "Expression of Odontogenic Ameloblast-Associated Protein (ODAM) in Dental and Other Epithelial Neoplasms",
    "date": "2008-04-11",
    "abstract": "We previously have communicated our discovery that the amyloid associated with calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors is composed of N-terminal fragments of the structurally novel odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein designated ODAM. Subsequently, it was shown by other investigators that ODAM is expressed in rodent enamel organ and is likely involved in dental development. We now report that this molecule also is found in certain human tissues, principally the salivary gland and trachea, as evidenced by RNA array analysis and immunohistochemistry-utilizing antibodies prepared against synthetic ODAM-related peptides and recombinant protein. Notably, these reagents immunostained normal and malignant ameloblasts and other types of human neoplastic cells, including those of gastric, lung, and breast origin where the presence in the latter was confirmed by in situ hybridization using gene-specific molecular probes. Moreover, significant titers of anti-ODAM IgG antibodies were detected in the sera of patients with these malignancies. Our studies have provided the first evidence in humans for the cellular expression of ODAM in normal and diseased states. Based on our findings, we posit that ODAM is a developmental antigen that has an essential role in tooth maturation and in the pathogenesis of certain odontogenic and other epithelial neoplasms; further, we suggest that ODAM may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker, as well as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for patients with breast and other epithelial forms of cancer.",

                "Odontogenic ameloblast-associated protein (ODAM) is encoded by a gene originally termed EO-009 (1) that consists of ten coding exons (Figure 1) located within an ~800 kbp region of chromosome 4q13 containing the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) cluster that specifies elements involved in bone and tooth development, as well as mineralization (2). Studies of rodent tissue have revealed that ODAM is highly expressed by mature ameloblasts (3) and is present in the enamel organ and junctional epithelial cells (4). In addition to the potential role of this protein (formerly designated APin) in odontogenesis, the results of DNA microarray analyses have shown that ODAM expression is up-regulated in human cervical (5) and gastric cancer (6).",
                "Although ODAM-related gene transcripts have been detected in a variety of mammalian tissues, including those of human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and canine origin (7), our report that the amyloid associated with calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumors (CEOT) is formed from an ODAM molecule provided the first example of this protein's expression (8). Through chemical analyses of amyloid fibrils isolated from three specimens, we found that these components were composed of N-terminal fragments of a 153-residue hypothetical protein specified by the FLJ20513 gene (a short form of ODAM cDNA cloned from the Kato III human signet-ring gastric carcinoma cell line [9,10]), where the last six of ten protein-encoding exons of ODAM are located. Subsequently, in studies of amyloid from four other CEOT cases, we identified varying amounts of a second ODAM-related protein with residues originating from the fourth exon (11). This discovery provided conclusive evidence for the transcription of a longer ODAM product that was predicted to consist of 279 amino acids, 126 of which are products of the first four coding exons (1,4).",
                "To gain further insight into the potential role of ODAM in tissue development and carcinogenesis, we have generated anti-ODAM specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, using as immunogens synthetic peptides and recombinant protein. We now report that these reagents recognized ODAM molecules, not only in ameloblasts, but also in certain normal and neoplastic human epithelial tissues-a finding confirmed at the molecular level through RNA array and in situ hybridization analyses. Our studies have provided definite evidence that ODAM is expressed under physiologic and pathologic conditions and suggest that when up-regulated, this protein may serve clinically as a novel cancer biomarker and provide a therapeutic target for patients with certain epithelial malignancies."

                "The fact that the ODAM gene is located in the SCPP cluster on chromosome 4q13 implies that this element also is involved in tooth formation. Indeed ODAM-related transcripts, highly homologous to the human counterpart, have been identified in mouse and rat enamel organs (1,2,4). Our immunohistochemical studies with mAb 5A-1 have demonstrated the presence of ODAM within ameloblasts in tenday-old murine teeth, unerupted human tooth follicles (a precursor to dental tumors, for example, CEOT) (18), and ameloblastomas. These findings indicate that this molecule has an essential role in normal and tumor-related odontogenesis. Notably, the follicular dendritic cell secretory protein gene, FDC-SP, located adjacent to ODAM, also has been found to be functional in late dental development within the periodontal ligament (19). Signaling pathways operative in odontogenesis include Shh, BMP, FGF, and Wnt that have been shown to be active in dental enamel knot signaling centers present within developing teeth and also in odontogenic tumors (20,21). Similarly, these pathways are considered to be essential in embryogenesis and organogenesis. Recently, it has been revealed by in situ hybridization (3) and immunohistochemistry (4) that ODAM is strongly expressed in maturation-stage rat incisor ameloblasts and in the junctional epithelium attached to the enamel of erupted molars, as well as in the late stage of ameloblast-lineage cell cultures (3,4).",
                "Additional products encoded by genes within the 4q13 SCPP cluster and implicated in dental development include amelogenin, amelotin, and ameloblastin (22,23). Many of these molecules, like ODAM, contain few or no cysteines and are characterized by a relatively large number of disorder-promoting amino acids, such as proline and glutamine (which, in the case of ODAM, comprise 33 and 40 of the 264 residues of the mature protein, respectively) that can impart multi-functional properties to such molecules (24) and may account for the presence of ODAM transcripts in odontogenic and non-odontogenic mammalian tissues. As for the latter, ODAM mRNA has been seen in rodent salivary and nasal glands (4) and, as we have shown, it (and protein) is present in human trachea and salivary gland. Other investigators have found this entity in the lacrimal gland (25) and breast ducts (26). Further, homologous ODAM cDNAs have been detected in fetal heart and lung, as well as in colon tissue (27).",
                "Historically, the first documented evidence of ODAM expression resulted as part of the Japanese NEDO human genome sequencing project where FLJ20513 cDNA encoding the 153-residue ODAM component was synthesized using mRNA from the Kato III human signet ring gastric carcinoma cell line (9). This transcript (AK000520.1) encompassed coding exons 5-10 of the long form of ODAM, but did not contain a 5\u2032-non-coding sequence (9). However, a murine ODAM cDNA (AK009298) (28) was found to have a different coding sequence at the end of the 5\u2032 region, thus supporting the presence of alternative splicing or, possibly, a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). Seemingly, this short ODAM protein would be deficient in a secretory signal sequence and presumably would remain within the cell where it could have a more restrictive or differing functional role from that of the larger ODAM product. Notably, the gene encoding ODAM has been predicted to evolve from those specifying enamelin and other evolutionarily-derived dental components, for example, amelogenin and amelotin, where alternative splicing occurs (29)(30)(31); this phenomenon has been documented in over 60% of human and mouse genes (32).",
                "Our studies have confirmed the presence of ODAM in gastric cancer where we demonstrated immunohistochemically that anti-ODAM mAb 8B-4 immunostained, with varying degrees of intensity, all but 14 specimens in a 60member human gastric tumor array. Through serial analyses of gene expression and quantitative RT-PCR of four primary human stomach cancers, it was found that ODAM was one of nine genes over-expressed, as compared with nongastric tissues, and posited that these elements could serve as possible tumor markers (33). Our detection of ODAM in other epithelial malignancies, for example, breast, lung, and gastric cancers, also suggests that this protein is up-regulated in these cancers. Interestingly, the FDC-SP gene, adjacent to ODAM in the SCPP cluster, is expressed in late dental development, as well as in neoplasms of the breast; further, it has been included as a gene signature screening component indicative of breast cancer invasiveness (19,34,35). In the case of colon cancer, this neoplasm results from a progressive series of steps whereby epithelial dysplasia evolves into a flat adenoma, carcinoma in situ, and finally, adenocarcinoma. Of note is that ODAM expression is increased ~6-fold in the earlier stage of disease, i.e., flat adenoma, as compared with the normal mucosa (36). Notably, epidermal growth factors such as ampiregulin, Figure 6. Co-localization of ODAM and Gli-1 in human epithelial malignancies. Sections of breast, lung, and gastric cancer immunostained (immunoperoxidase reaction) with anti-ODAM mAb 8B-4 and anti-Gli antibody as primary reagents (CT, connective tissue; IT, infiltrating tumor cells; LC, lung carcinoma cells; GC, gastric carcinoma cells; GL, gastric gland). Original magnifications, \u00d7200. epigen, and epiregulin, which are found in a variety of human cancers, including those of breast and gastrointestinal origin, map to the identical chromosomal band (4q13.3) and are present in a cisoriented cluster on the same DNA strand as ODAM and FDC-SP (37).",
                "ODAM may have a functional role in the pathogenesis of epithelial malignances, given that this molecule has been shown to interact with parvalbumin (an EF-hand calcium-binding protein) and additionally, modulates the expression of at least one metalloproteinase (MMP-20), molecules implicated in aggressive and metastatic cancer (38,39). Further, we posit that the ODAM gene is up-regulated by the Shh pathway which is involved in carcinogenesis, as evidenced by the concomitant expression of the zinc finger transcription factor Gli-1 (an Shh pathway member) in CEOT and other odontogenic neoplasms (7,40), as well as gastric (41), breast (42,43), and lung cancers (44). The discovery that ODAM, in addition to its role in the development of teeth and other body tissues, may be implicated in neoplastic transformation has potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",
                "Autoantibodies frequently are found in the sera of patients with malignances and the titers of these components have been correlated to survival and other clinicopathological parameters (45)(46)(47). Notably, the reactivity of these molecules may be directed against cancer-associated proteins (for example, Her-2, Nectin-4, Muc-1) that have been implicated in either tumor growth or invasiveness (48,49). In this regard, our detection of serum anti-ODAM IgG antibodies in patients with breast, lung, and gastric cancer implies that they represent an immune response that may have functional import. Further, the presence and titer of anti-ODAM antibodies could serve as a unique prognostic biomarker for patients with epithelial forms of cancer.  "
