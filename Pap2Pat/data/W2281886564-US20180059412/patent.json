                        "The step of injecting light is implemented by a waveguide which is on a substrate onto which the photonic resonator is positioned, the waveguide being in the vicinity of the photonic resonator in order to allow near-field optical coupling between the two, the light wavelength of the injected light being larger than a material bandgap wavelength.",

                        "This method is thus scalable to a large number of photonic devices and still requires a single tuning step and a short amount of time (order of the minute), therefore overwhelming the drawbacks of the prior art.",
                        "The fact that the tuning step automatically etches the photonic devices of largest size, and then automatically etches all the cavities of identical size at identical speed, provides a fast tuning mechanism and does not require the one-by-one identification of the numerous resonators involved in a collective architecture.",

Between spectrum of FIG. 16 and the one of FIG. 17, a shift in the resonance wavelengths \u03bbr is observed (around 4 nm), corresponding to the result of the etching process. But the quality factors of the doublet of resonator 10 before the tuning are around 42 000/42 000 (\u03bbr\u22481334 nm and \u0394\u03bb \u224832 pm for both dips of the doublet) and the quality factors afterwards are around 53 000/70 000 (\u03bbr\u22481330 nm and \u0394\u03bb \u224825 pm and 19 pm for the dips of the doublet).
