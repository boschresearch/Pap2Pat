                        "The identification of patient subpopulations most likely to respond to therapy is a central goal of modern molecular medicine. This notion is particularly important for cancer due to the large number of approved and experimental therapies (Rothenberg et al., 2003, Nat. Rev. Cancer 3:303-309), low response rates to many current treatments, and clinical importance of using the optimal therapy in the first treatment cycle (Dracopoli, 2005, Curr. Mol. Med. 5:103-110). In addition, the narrow therapeutic index and severe toxicity profiles associated with currently marketed cytotoxics results in a pressing need for accurate response prediction. Although recent studies have identified gene expression signatures associated with response to cytotoxic chemotherapies (Folgueria et al., 2005, Clin. Cancer Res. 11:7434-7443; Ayers et al., 2004, 22:2284-2293; Chang et al., 2003, Lancet 362:362-369; Rouzier et al., 2005, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102: 8315-8320), these examples (and others from the literature) remain unvalidated and have not yet had a major effect on clinical practice. In addition to technical issues, such as lack of a standard technology platform and difficulties surrounding the collection of clinical samples, the myriad of cellular processes affected by cytotoxic chemotherapies may hinder the identification of practical and robust gene expression predictors of response to these agents. One exception may be the recent finding by microarray that low mRNA expression of the microtubule-associate protein Tau is predictive of improved response to paclitaxel (Rouzier et al., supra).",
                        "To improve on the limitations of cytotoxic chemotherapies, current approaches to drug design in oncology are aimed at modulating specific cell signaling pathways important for tumor growth and survival (Hahn and Weinberg, 2002, Nat. Rev. Cancer 2:331-341; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, Cell 100:57-70; Trosko et al., 2004, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1028:192-201). In cancer cells, these pathways become deregulated resulting in aberrant signaling, inhibition of apoptosis, increased metastasis, and increased cell proliferation (reviewed in Adjei and Hildalgo, 2005, J. Clin. Oncol. 23:5386-5403). Although normal cells integrate multiple signaling pathways for controlled growth and proliferation, tumors seem to be heavily reliant on activation of one or two pathways (\u201concogene activation\u201d). In addition to the well-known dependence of chronic myelogenous leukemia on BCR-ABL, studies of the epidermal growth factor receptor and MYC pathways showed that inactivation of a single critical oncogene can induce cell death or differentiation into cells with a normal phenotype (Lynch et al., 2004, N. Engl. J. Med. 350: 2129-2139; Paez et al., 2004, Science 304:1497-1500; Weinstein, 2002, Science 297:63-64; Jain et al., 2002, Science 297:102-104; Gorre et al., 2001, Science 293:876-880; Druker et al., 2001, N. Engl. J. Med. 344:1031-1037). The components of these aberrant signaling pathways represent attractive selective targets for new anticancer therapies. In addition, responder identification for target therapies may be more achievable than for cytotoxics, as it seems logical that patients with tumors that are \u201cdriven\u201d by a particular pathway will respond to therapeutics targeting components of that pathway. Therefore, it is crucial that we develop methods to identify which pathways are active in which tumors and use this information to guide therapeutic decisions. One way to enable this is to identify gene expression profiles that are indicative of pathway activation status.",
                        "Current methods for assessing pathway activation in tumors involve the measurement of drug targets, known oncogenes, or known tumor suppressors. However, one pathway can be activated at multiple points, so it is not always feasible to assess pathway activation by evaluating known cancer-associated genes (Downward, 2006, Nature 439:274-275). RAS and its effectors regulate cell growth, differentiation, motility, survival, and death (Downward, 2002, Nat. Rev. Cancer 3:11-22). RAS proteins are members of a large superfamily of GTP binding proteins that serve as a molecular switch, converting signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Some distinct members of the RAS family include HRas, KRas, MRas, NRas, and RRas (Adjei, 2001, J. Nat. Cancer Instit. 93:1062-1073). Deregulation of RAS pathways by mutational activation or by receptor-mediated activation of RAS contribute to human malignancies (Downward, supra). Approximately one third of all human cancers, including cancers of the pancreas, colon, and lung, express a constitutively active RAS (Downward, supra). Aberrant RAS signaling in tumors may also be caused by loss of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), such as neurofibromin, encoded by NF1; growth factor receptor activation, such as EGFR and ERBB2, or mutation or amplification of RAS effectors, such as BRAF mutation, PTEN loss, AKT2 amplification, or PI3K amplification (Downward, supra). This pathway can be activated by multiple growth factors through receptor tyrosine kinases and has effects on multiple processes, including cell growth and survival, metastatic competence, and therapy resistance (Downward, supra). Therefore, inhibition of RAS or its upstream activators or downstream effectors may be a promising pharmacologic strategy for cancer therapy (Cox and Der, 2002 Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2:388-93; Blum and Kloog, 2005, Drug Resist. Updat. 8:369-80; Downward, supra; Dancey, 2002, Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2259-2267). RAS pathway activation is also an indicator of resistance to therapeutic agents targeting EGFR and PI3K (Massarelli et al., 2007, Clin. Cancer Res. 13:2890-2896; Raponi et al., 2008, Curr. Opin. Pharmacology 8:413-418; Ihle et al., 2009, Cancer Res. 69:143-150). Accordingly, accurate determination of RAS pathway activation will be critical for the identification of potential responders to these emerging novel therapeutics.",
                        "However, the RAS pathway can be activated by aberrations at multiple points, and assessing pathway activity may not be straightforward (Downward, supra). For example, RAS itself (K-RAS, N-RAS, H-RAS) is frequently mutated in cancers. RAS mutations are common in pancreatic, lungadenocarcinoma, and colorectal cancers (Downward, supra). The RAS pathway can also be activated by loss of GAPs, such as neurofibromin (Weiss et al., 1999, Am. J. Med. Genet. 89:14-22); growth factor receptor activation (Mendelsohn and Baselga, 2000, Oncogene 19:6550-6565); and mutation or amplification of RAS pathway effectors (Bellacosa, 1995, Intl. J. Cancer 64:280-285; Simpson and Parsons, 2001, Exp. Cell Res. 264:29-41). Although RAS pathway activation can be assessed by sequence analysis (Bos, 1989, Cancer Res. 49:4682-4689), this may not be the optimal way to measure pathway activation. Sequence analysis of RAS misses other pathway activators and is not quantitative. In addition, oncogenic pathways are complex, so important pathway mediators may be missed by testing only a few well-characterized pathway components.",
                        "Examples like this suggest that a gene expression signature-based readout of pathway activation may be more appropriate than relying on a single indicator of pathway activity, as the same signature of gene expression may be elicited by activation of multiple components of the pathway. In addition, by integrating expression data from multiple genes, a quantitative assessment of pathway activity may be possible. In addition to using gene expression signatures for tumor classification by assessing pathway activation status, gene expression signatures for pathway activation may also be used as pharmacodynamic biomarkers, i.e., monitoring pathway inhibition in patient tumors or peripheral tissues post-treatment; as response prediction biomarkers, i.e., prospectively identifying patients harboring tumors that have high levels of a particular pathway activity before treating the patients with inhibitors targeting the pathway or identifying patients harboring tumors that have high levels of a particular pathway activity and are therefore likely to be resistant to particular inhibitors; and as early efficacy biomarkers, i.e., an early readout of efficacy."

                                "Various embodiments of the invention relate to sets of genetic biomarkers whose expression patterns correlate with an important characteristic of cancer cells, i.e., deregulation of the RAS signaling pathway. In some embodiments, these sets of biomarkers may be split into two opposing \u201carms\u201d \u2014the \u201cup\u201d arm (Table 2a), which are the genes that are upregulated, and the \u201cdown\u201d arm (Table 2b), which are the genes that are downregulated, as signaling through the RAS pathway increases. More specifically, some aspects of the invention provide for sets of genetic biomarkers whose expression correlates with the regulation status of the RAS signaling pathway of a tumor cell sample of a patient, and which can be used to classify tumors with deregulated RAS signaling pathway from tumors with regulated RAS signaling pathway. RAS signaling pathway regulation status is a useful indicator of the likelihood that a patient will respond to certain therapies, such as inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway, or likelihood that a patient will be resistant to certain therapies, such as EGFR or PI3K pathway inhibitors. Such therapies include, but are not limited to: PI3K inhibitors LY249002, wortmannin, and PX-866; AKT inhibitors 17-AAG, PX316, miltefosine, and perifosin; EGFR inhibitors ZD1839; IMC-C225; ERBB2 inhibitor Herceptin; RAS inhibitors ISIS 2503 and farnesyl transferase inhibitor R115777, L731735, SCH 66336, and BMS214662; Raf inhibitors ISIS 5132 and BAY43-9006; MEK inhibitors PD184322 and CI-1040 (reviewed in Henson and Gibson 2006, Cellular Signalling 18:2089-2097; Hennessy et al., 2005, Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 4:988-1004; reviewed in Dancey, 2002, Curr. Pharm. Des. 8:2259-2267; Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999, Nat. Med. 5:810-816; Downward, 2003, Nat. Rev. Cancer 3:11-22). In one aspect of the invention, methods are provided for use of these biomarkers to distinguish between patient groups that will likely respond to inhibitors of the RAS signaling pathway (predicted responders) and patient groups that will not likely respond to inhibitors of the RAS pathway signaling pathway (predicted non-responders) and to determine general courses of treatment. In another aspect of the invention, methods are provided for use of these biomarkers to distinguish between patient groups that will not likely respond to inhibitors of the PI3K signaling pathway or EGFR inhibitors (predicted non-responders) and patient groups that will likely respond to inhibitors of the PI3K signaling pathway or EGFR inhibitors. Another aspect of the invention relates to biomarkers whose expression correlates with a pharmacodynamic effect of a therapeutic agent on the RAS signaling pathway in subject with cancer. In yet other aspects of the invention, methods are provided for use of these biomarkers to measure the pharmacodynamic effect of a therapeutic agent on the RAS signaling pathway in a subject with cancer and the use of these biomarkers to rank the efficacy of therapeutic agents to modulate the RAS signaling pathway. Microarrays comprising these biomarkers are also provided, as well as methods of contructing such microarrays. Each of the biomarkers correspond to a gene in the human genome, i.e., such biomarker is identifiable as all or a portion of a gene. Finally, because each of the above biomarkers correlate with cancer-related conditions, the biomarkers, or the proteins they encode, are likely to be targets for drugs against cancer."

The increased proximity of SOS to RAS results in increased nucleotide exchange on RAS, with GDP being replaced with GTP. GTP-bound RAS is able to bind and activate several families of effector enzymes (such as the RAF, PI3K, RALGDS, and PLC\u03b5 pathways)(reviewed in Downward, 2003, Nat. Rev.

                                "The invention provides for methods of using the biomarker sets to analyze a sample from an individual so as to determine or classify the individual's tumor type at a molecular level, whether a tumor has a deregulated or regulated RAS signaling pathway. The individual need not actually be afflicted with cancer. Essentially, the expression of specific biomarker genes in the individual, or a sample taken therefrom, is compared to a standard or control. For example, assume two cancer-related conditions, X and Y. One can compare the level of expression of RAS signaling pathway biomarkers for condition X in an individual to the level of the biomarker-derived polynucleotides in a control, wherein the level represents the level of expression exhibited by samples having condition X. In this instance, if the expression of the markers in the individual's sample is substantially (i.e., statistically) different from that of the control, then the individual does not have condition X. Where, as here, the choice is bimodal (i.e. a sample is either X or Y), the individual can additionally be said to have condition Y. Of course, the comparison to a control representing condition Y can also be performed. Preferably, both are performed simultaneously, such that each control acts as both a positive and a negative control. The distinguishing result may thus either be a demonstrable difference from the expression levels (i.e. the amount of marker-derived RNA, or polynucleotides derived therefrom) represented by the control, or no significant difference.",
                                "Thus, in one embodiment, the method of determining a particular tumor-related status of an individual comprises the steps of (1) hybridizing labeled target polynucleotides from an individual to a microarray containing the above biomarker set or a subset of the biomarkers; (2) hybridizing standard or control polynucleotide molecules to the microarray, wherein the standard or control molecules are differentially labeled from the target molecules; and (3) determining the difference in transcript levels, or lack thereof, between the target and standard or control, wherein the difference, or lack thereof, determines the individual's tumor-related status. In a more specific embodiment, the standard or control molecules comprise biomarker-derived polynucleotides from a pool of samples from normal individuals, a pool of samples from normal adjacent tissue, or a pool of tumor samples from individuals with cancer. In a preferred embodiment, the standard or control is artificially-generated pool of biomarker-derived polynucleotides, which pool is designed to mimic the level of biomarker expression exhibited by clinical samples of normal or cancer tumor tissue having a particular clinical indication (i.e. cancerous or non-cancerous; RAS signaling pathway regulated or deregulated). In another specific embodiment, the control molecules comprise a pool derived from normal or cancer cell lines.",

Thus, in one embodiment of the above method, the level of polynucleotides (i.e., mRNA or polynucleotides derived therefrom) in a sample from an individual, expressed from the biomarkers provided in Tables 2a and 2b are compared to the level of expression of the same biomarkers from a control, wherein the control comprises biomarker-related polynucleotides derived from deregulated RAS signaling pathway tumor samples, regulated RAS signaling pathway tumor samples, or both. The comparison may be to both deregulated and regulated RAS signaling pathway tumor samples, and the comparison may be to polynucleotide pools from a number of deregulated and regulated RAS signaling pathway tumor samples, respectively. Where the individual's biomarker expression most closely resembles or correlates with the deregulated control, and does not resemble or correlate with the regulated control, the individual is classified as having a deregulated RAS signaling pathway. Where the pool is not pure deregulated or regulated RAS signaling pathway type tumors samples, for example, a sporadic pool is used, a set of experiments using individuals with known RAS signaling pathway status may be hybridized against the pool in order to define the expression templates for the deregulated and regulated group. Each individual with unknown RAS signaling pathway status is hybridized against the same pool and the expression profile is compared to the template(s) to determine the individual's RAS signaling pathway status.",

For example, if the two tailed t-test is used to determine whether the mean log(10) ratio of the genes in the \u201cup\u201d arm is significantly different than the mean log(10) ratio of the genes in the \u201cdown\u201d arm, a p-value of <0.05 indicates that the signature in the individual sample is significantly different from the standard or control.

It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that other differential expression values, besides log(10) ratio may be used for calculating a signature score, as long as the value represents an objective measurement of transcript abundance of the biomarker gene.

In some embodiments, starting values for weights are chosen to be random values near zero. Hence the model starts out nearly linear, and becomes nonlinear as the weights increase. Individual units localize to directions and introduce nonlinearities where needed. Use of exact zero weights leads to zero derivatives and perfect symmetry, and the algorithm never moves. Alternatively, starting with large weights often leads to poor solutions.",

If too many hidden units are used in a neural network, the network will have too many degrees of freedom and is trained too long, there is a danger that the network will overfit the data. If there are too few hidden units, the training set cannot be learned. Generally speaking, however, it is better to have too many hidden units than too few. With too few hidden units, the model might not have enough flexibility to capture the nonlinearities in the data; with too many hidden units, the extra weight can be shrunk towards zero if appropriate regularization or pruning, as described below, is used.

A remarkable property of this alternative representation is that only a subset of the points will be associated with a non-zero \u03b1i. These points are called support vectors and are the points that lie closest to the separating hyperplane. The sparseness of the \u03b1 vector has several computational and learning theoretic consequences. It is important to note that neither the learning algorithm nor the decision function needs to represent explicitly the image of points in the feature space, \u03c6(Xi), since both use only the dot products between such images, (\u03c6Xi),\u03c6(Xj). Hence, if one were given a function K(X, Y)=\u03c6(X),\u03c6(X), one could learn and use the maximum margin hyperplane in the feature space without ever explicitly performing the mapping. For each continuous positive definite function K(X, Y) there exists a mapping 0 such that K(X, Y)=\u03c6(X), \u03c6(X) for all X, Y \u03b5 R0 (Mercer's Theorem). The function K(X, Y) is called the kernel function. The use of a kernel function allows the support vector machine to operate efficiently in a nonlinear high-dimensional feature spaces without being adversely affected by the dimensionality of that space. Indeed, it is possible to work with feature spaces of infinite dimension. Moreover, Mercer's theorem makes it possible to learn in the feature space without even knowing \u03c6 and F. The matrix Kij=\u03c6(Xi),\u03c6(Xj) is called the kernel matrix. Finally, note that the learning algorithm is a quadratic optimization problem that has only a global optimum. The absence of local minima is a significant difference from standard pattern recognition techniques such as neural networks. For moderate sample sizes, the optimization problem can be solved with simple gradient descent techniques. In the presence of noise, the standard maximum margin algorithm described above can be subject to overfitting, and more sophisticated techniques should be used. This problem arises because the maximum margin algorithm always finds a perfectly consistent hypothesis and does not tolerate training error. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to trade some training accuracy for better predictive power. The need for tolerating training error has led to the development the soft-margin and the margin-distribution classifiers.

This in turn corresponds to an asymmetric margin; i.e., the class with smaller d will be kept further away from the decision boundary.

In some embodiments, LDA is applied to the data matrix of the N members in the training sample by K genes in a combination of genes described in the present invention. Then, the linear discriminant of each member of the training population is plotted. Ideally, those members of the training population representing a first subgroup (e.g. those subjects that have deregulated RAS signaling pathway status) will cluster into one range of linear discriminant values (e.g., negative) and those member of the training population representing a second subgroup (e.g. those subjects that have regulated RAS signaling pathway status) will cluster into a second range of linear discriminant values (e.g., positive).

First, a way to measure similarity (or dissimilarity) between two samples is determined. This metric (similarity measure) is used to ensure that the samples in one cluster are more like one another than they are to samples in other clusters. Second, a mechanism for partitioning the data into clusters using the similarity measure is determined.",

If distance is a good measure of similarity, then the distance between samples in the same cluster will be significantly less than the distance between samples in different clusters. However, as stated on page 215 of Duda, clustering does not require the use of a distance metric. For example, a nonmetric similarity function s(x, x\u2032) can be used to compare two vectors x and x\u2032. Conventionally, s(x, x\u2032) is a symmetric function whose value is large when x and x\u2032 are somehow \u201csimilar\u201d.

                                "Inspired by the process of biological evolution, evolutionary methods of classifier design employ a stochastic search for an optimal classifier. In broad overview, such methods create several classifiers\u2014a population\u2014from measurements of gene products of the present invention. Each classifier varies somewhat from the other. Next, the classifiers are scored on expression data across the training population. In keeping with the analogy with biological evolution, the resulting (scalar) score is sometimes called the fitness. The classifiers are ranked according to their score and the best classifiers are retained (some portion of the total population of classifiers). Again, in keeping with biological terminology, this is called survival of the fittest. The classifiers are stochastically altered in the next generation\u2014the children or offspring. Some offspring classifiers will have higher scores than their parent in the previous generation, some will have lower scores. The overall process is then repeated for the subsequent generation: The classifiers are scored and the best ones are retained, randomly altered to give yet another generation, and so on. In part, because of the ranking, each generation has, on average, a slightly higher score than the previous one. The process is halted when the single best classifier in a generation has a score that exceeds a desired criterion value.

At stem m, those observations that were misclassified by the classifier Gm\u22121(x) induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were classified correctly.

Any method for determining RNA levels can be used. For example, RNA is isolated from a sample and separated on an agarose gel. The separated RNA is then transferred to a solid support, such as a filter. Nucleic acid probes representing one or more biomarkers are then hybridized to the filter by northern hybridization, and the amount of biomarker-derived RNA is determined Such determination can be visual, or machine-aided, for example, by use of a densitometer. Another method of determining RNA levels is by use of a dot-blot or a slot-blot. In this method, RNA, or nucleic acid derived therefrom, from a sample is labeled. The RNA or nucleic acid derived therefrom is then hybridized to a filter containing oligonucleotides derived from one or more biomarker genes, wherein the oligonucleotides are placed upon the filter at discrete, easily-identifiable locations. Hybridization, or lack thereof, of the labeled RNA to the filter-bound oligonucleotides is determined visually or by densitometer.

Alternatively, proteins can be separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis systems. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is well-known in the art and typically involves isoelectric focusing along a first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis along a second dimension.

When these methods are used, oligonucleotides (e.g., 60-mers) of known sequence are synthesized directly on a surface such as a derivatized glass slide. Usually, the array produced is redundant, with several oligonucleotide molecules per RNA.",
                                "Other methods for making microarrays, e.g., by masking (Maskos and Southern, 1992, Nuc. Acids. Res. 20:1679-1684), may also be used. In principle, and as noted supra, any type of array, for example, dot blots on a nylon hybridization membrane (see Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING\u2014A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) could be used. However, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art, very small arrays will frequently be preferred because hybridization volumes will be smaller.",
                                "In one embodiment, the arrays of the present invention are prepared by synthesizing polynucleotide probes on a support. In such an embodiment, polynucleotide probes are attached to the support covalently at either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide.",
                                "In a particularly preferred embodiment, microarrays of the invention are manufactured by means of an ink jet printing device for oligonucleotide synthesis, e.g., using the methods and systems described by Blanchard in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,189; Blanchard et al., 1996, Biosensors and Bioelectronics 11:687-690; Blanchard, 1998, in SYNTHETIC DNA ARRAYS IN GENETIC ENGINEERING, Vol. 20, J. K. Setlow, Ed., Plenum Press, New York at pages 111-123. Specifically, the oligonucleotide probes in such microarrays are preferably synthesized in arrays, e.g., on a glass slide, by serially depositing individual nucleotide bases in \u201cmicrodroplets\u201d of a high surface tension solvent such as propylene carbonate. The microdroplets have small volumes (e.g., 100 pL or less, more preferably 50 pL or less) and are separated from each other on the microarray (e.g., by hydrophobic domains) to form circular surface tension wells which define the locations of the array elements (i.e., the different probes). Microarrays manufactured by this ink-jet method are typically of high density, preferably having a density of at least about 2,500 different probes per 1 cm2. The polynucleotide probes are attached to the support covalently at either the 3\u2032 or the 5\u2032 end of the polynucleotide.",

In one embodiment, the target polynucleotide molecules comprise RNA, including, but by no means limited to, total cellular RNA, poly(A)+messenger RNA (mRNA) or fraction thereof, cytoplasmic mRNA, or RNA transcribed from cDNA (i.e., cRNA; see, e.g., Linsley & Schelter, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/411,074, filed Oct. 4, 1999, or U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,522, 5,891,636, or 5,716,785). Methods for preparing total and poly(A)+ RNA are well known in the art, and are described generally, e.g., in Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING\u2014A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). In one embodiment, RNA is extracted from cells of the various types of interest in this invention using guanidinium thiocyanate lysis followed by CsCl centrifugation (Chirgwin et al., 1979, Biochemistry 18:5294-5299). In another embodiment, total RNA is extracted using a silica gel-based column, commercially available examples of which include RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and StrataPrep (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). In an alternative embodiment, which is preferred for S. cerevisiae, RNA is extracted from cells using phenol and chloroform, as described in Ausubel et al., eds., 1989, CURRENT PROTOCOLS 1N MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Vol. III, Green Publishing Associates, Inc., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, at pp. 13.12.1-13.12.5). Poly(A)+ RNA can be selected, e.g., by selection with oligo-dT cellulose or, alternatively, by oligo-dT primed reverse transcription of total cellular RNA. In one embodiment, RNA can be fragmented by methods known in the art, e.g., by incubation with ZnCl2, to generate fragments of RNA. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide molecules analyzed by the invention comprise cDNA, or PCR products of amplified RNA or cDNA.",
                                "In one embodiment, total RNA, mRNA, or nucleic acids derived therefrom, is isolated from a sample taken from a person afflicted with breast cancer. Target polynucleotide molecules that are poorly expressed in particular cells may be enriched using normalization techniques (Bonaldo et al., 1996, Genome Res. 6:791-806).",
                                "As described above, the target polynucleotides are detectably labeled at one or more nucleotides. Any method known in the art may be used to detectably label the target polynucleotides. Preferably, this labeling incorporates the label uniformly along the length of the RNA, and more preferably, the labeling is carried out at a high degree of efficiency. One embodiment for this labeling uses oligo-dT primed reverse transcription to incorporate the label; however, conventional methods of this method are biased toward generating 3\u2032 end fragments. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, random primers (e.g., 9-mers) are used in reverse transcription to uniformly incorporate labeled nucleotides over the fill length of the target polynucleotides. Alternatively, random primers may be used in conjunction with PCR methods or T7 promoter-based in vitro transcription methods in order to amplify the target polynucleotides.",
                                "In a preferred embodiment, the detectable label is a luminescent label. For example, fluorescent labels, bio-luminescent labels, chemi-luminescent labels, and colorimetric labels may be used in the present invention. In a highly preferred embodiment, the label is a fluorescent label, such as a fluorescein, a phosphor, a rhodamine, or a polymethine dye derivative. Examples of commercially available fluorescent labels include, for example, fluorescent phosphoramidites such as FluorePrime (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.), Fluoredite (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.), FAM (ABI, Foster City, Calif.), and Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). In another embodiment, the detectable label is a radiolabeled nucleotide.",
                                "In a further preferred embodiment, target polynucleotide molecules from a patient sample are labeled differentially from target polynucleotide molecules of a standard. The standard can comprise target polynucleotide molecules from normal individuals (i.e., those not afflicted with cancer). In a highly preferred embodiment, the standard comprises target polynucleotide molecules pooled from samples from normal individuals or tumor samples from individuals having cancer. In another embodiment, the target polynucleotide molecules are derived from the same individual, but are taken at different time points, and thus indicate the efficacy of a treatment by a change in expression of the biomarkers, or lack thereof during and after the course of treatment (i.e., RAS pathway therapeutic agent), wherein a change in the expression of the biomarkers from a RAS pathway deregulation pattern to a RAS pathway regulation pattern indicates that the treatment is efficacious. In this embodiment, different timepoints are differentially labeled.",

                                "Nucleic acid hybridization and wash conditions are chosen so that the target polynucleotide molecules specifically bind or specifically hybridize to the complementary polynucleotide sequences of the array, preferably to a specific array site, wherein its complementary DNA is located.",
                                "Arrays containing double-stranded probe DNA situated thereon are preferably subjected to denaturing conditions to render the DNA single-stranded prior to contacting with the target polynucleotide molecules. Arrays containing single-stranded probe DNA (e.g., synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleic acids) may need to be denatured prior to contacting with the target polynucleotide molecules, e.g., to remove hairpins or dimers which form due to self complementary sequences.",
                                "Optimal hybridization conditions will depend on the length (e.g., oligomer versus polynucleotide greater than 200 bases) and type (e.g., RNA, or DNA) of probe and target nucleic acids. One of skill in the art will appreciate that as the oligonucleotides become shorter, it may become necessary to adjust their length to achieve a relatively uniform melting temperature for satisfactory hybridization results. General parameters for specific (i.e., stringent) hybridization conditions for nucleic acids are described in Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING\u2014A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), and in Ausubel et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994). Typical hybridization conditions for the cDNA microarrays of Schena et al. are hybridization in 5\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS at 65\u00b0 C. for four hours, followed by washes at 25\u00b0 C. in low stringency wash buffer (1\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS), followed by 10 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. in higher stringency wash buffer (0.1\u00d7SSC plus 0.2% SDS) (Schena et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:10614 (1993)). Useful hybridization conditions are also provided in, e.g., Tijessen, 1993, HYBRIDIZATION WITH NUCLEIC ACID PROBES, Elsevier Science Publishers B. V.; and Kricka, 1992, NONISOTOPIC DNA PROBE TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.",
                                "Particularly preferred hybridization conditions include hybridization at a temperature at or near the mean melting temperature of the probes (e.g., within 5\u00b0 C., more preferably within 2\u00b0 C.) in 1 M NaCl, 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5), 0.5% sodium sarcosine and 30% formamide.",

                                "When fluorescently labeled probes are used, the fluorescence emissions at each site of a microarray may be, preferably, detected by scanning confocal laser microscopy. In one embodiment, a separate scan, using the appropriate excitation line, is carried out for each of the two fluorophores used. Alternatively, a laser may be used that allows simultaneous specimen illumination at wavelengths specific to the two fluorophores and emissions from the two fluorophores can be analyzed simultaneously (see Shalon et al., 1996, \u201cA DNA microarray system for analyzing complex DNA samples using two-color fluorescent probe hybridization,\u201d Genome Research 6:639-645, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the arrays are scanned with a laser fluorescent scanner with a computer controlled X-Y stage and a microscope objective. Sequential excitation of the two fluorophores is achieved with a multi-line, mixed gas laser and the emitted light is split by wavelength and detected with two photomultiplier tubes. Fluorescence laser scanning devices are described in Schena et al., Genome Res. 6:639-645 (1996), and in other references cited herein. Alternatively, the fiber-optic bundle described by Ferguson et al., Nature Biotech. 14:1681-1684 (1996), may be used to monitor mRNA abundance levels at a large number of sites simultaneously.",
                                "Signals are recorded and, in a preferred embodiment, analyzed by computer, e.g., using a 12 or 16 bit analog to digital board. In one embodiment the scanned image is despeckled using a graphics program (e.g., Hijaak Graphics Suite) and then analyzed using an image gridding program that creates a spreadsheet of the average hybridization at each wavelength at each site. If necessary, an experimentally determined correction for \u201ccross talk\u201d (or overlap) between the channels for the two fluors may be made. For any particular hybridization site on the transcript array, a ratio of the emission of the two fluorophores can be calculated. The ratio is independent of the absolute expression level of the cognate gene, but is useful for genes whose expression is significantly modulated in association with the different breast cancer-related condition."

                                "Genome wide gene expression profiling provides a new paradigm for detecting and understanding oncogene deregulation by measuring coherent changes in multiple genes downstream from oncogene signaling. A recent study by Bild et al. (2006, Nature 439:353-357) set the stage for developing oncogene signatures for activation of the RAS, Myc, E2F3, Src, and beta-catenin pathways. These signatures were derived from primary human mammary epithelial cells stably transfected with each of these five oncogenes. The linear combination of genes in the signatures was shown to be predictive of sensitivity to therapeutic agents targeting specific pathways. Although this study provided an important proof of concept for developing oncogene signatures, it left open for interpretation the exact methods for using the genes in the signatures for measuring oncogene deregulation in tumor samples. Specifically, the expectation from this study was that the genes from the RAS signature that were perturbed in opposite directions by RAS overexpression would be anti-correlated when assessed in large sets of tumor samples that have variable RAS activity. However, these genes showed a positive correlation in such tumor samples. Thus, a linear combination of genes with the same signs as observed in the training set would fail to detect upregulation of RAS signaling in test sets from human tumors.",
                                "An alternative method for developing a RAS signature was proposed by Sweet-Cordero et al. (2005, Nat. Genet. 37:48-55). This group used cross-species gene expression analysis to derive a signature of oncogenic KRAS2. They obtained gene expression profiles from the tumors of mice genetically engineered to express activated KRAS2 in lung tissues and compared these profiles to human lung cancers. A common gene expression signature was found between mice and humans. A third approach to derive a RAS signature was used by Blum et al. (2007, Cancer Res. 67:3320-3328), who derived a RAS signature by blocking RAS activity with Salirasib (S-Farnesylthiosalicylic Acid). A RAS signature was derived from gene expression changes in 5 human tumor cell lines at 24-72 hr post treatment. While these three signatures report on a similar biological state (RAS activity), the signatures contain different genes, and did not show a coherent pattern of expression in cell line panels or tumors based on our internal gene expression profiling data.",
                                "We wished to identify a gene expression signature of RAS pathway activity that was coherent across various cell lines and tumor datasets and could be used in pre-clinical models. We started with four RAS pathway signatures identified in three publications: 1) Bild et al., 2006, Nature 439:353-357 (referred to hereinafter as \u201cNevins\u201d); 2) Blum et al., 2007, Cancer Res. 67:3320-3328 (referred to hereinafter as \u201cBlum\u201d; and 3) Sweet-Carder et al., 2005, Nat. Genet. 37:48-55 (original signature referred to hereinafter as \u201cJacks\u201d and refined signature referred to hereinafter as \u201cJacks123\u201d). All of these RAS signatures were split into two opposing \u201carms\u201d \u2014the \u201cup\u201d arm, comprising the set of genes that are upregulated as signaling through the RAS pathway increases, and the \u201cdown\u201d arm, comprising the set of genes that are down-regulated as signaling through the RAS pathway increases.",
                                "We derived our own RAS signature using supervised analysis of the Nevins, Blum, Jacks, and Jacks123 signatures and their consensus prediction of RAS mutation status generated in lung cell lines. Specifically, we used the consensus prediction of KRAS mutation status generated in lung cell lines (RAS mutation status identified from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/CellLines/). We derived a coherent \u201cup\u201d core set of 105 genes from the above published signatures (See Table 2a). Using this core set of \u201cup\u201d genes as a seed set, we then identified genes that were anti-correleated with the \u201cup\u201d genes and were upregulated in RAS wild-type cell lines compared to mutant. These 42 anti-correlated genes represent the \u201cdown\u201d arm of our RAS signature (See Table 2b)."

The purpose of coherence analysis is to show the statistical significance of the difference between the \u201cUp\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d arms of the signature in a new dataset. Two correlation coefficients were calculated for all of the genes in both the Up and Down arms. First, the correlation between each gene in the Up arm and the average of all genes in the Up arm is calculated. Second, the anticorrelation between each gene in the Up arm and the average of all genes in the Down arm is calculated. This is repeated for genes in the Down arm. If the signature is coherent, most of the genes from the Up arm should correlate with the average of all Up genes and anticorrelate with the average of all genes in the Down arm. A Fisher exact test is calculated for correlation within and between arms of the signature to assess the significance of signature coherence in a new dataset. Signatures are refined by filtering out the genes that do not show the correct correlation-anticorrelation behavior. This filtering process enables the identification of the subset of signature genes that retains information regarding signaling activity and elimination of genes that are not robustly co-regulated in a new dataset. RAS pathway activity (or regulation) is summarized into a RAS signature score, which is calculated as: (mean expression of Up genes (Table 2a))\u2014(mean expression of Down genes (Table 2b)). A sample with a RAS pathway signature score >0 is classified as having a deregulated RAS pathway, while a RAS pathway signature score <0 is classified as having a regulated RAS pathway.",

Prediction of RAS mutation status was also performed on cell lines from the cell lines atlas for which RAS mutation data was available. Further check of the coherence of signatures was performed on the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) colon and breast datasets, fresh tumors (Tumor Atlas for breast, colon, lung), and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples (the Mayo FFPE datasets for lung, ovarian and breast).",

Biotechnol. 19:342-347; Marton et al., 1998, Nat. Med. 4:1293-1301). Briefly, 4 \u03bcg of total RNA from each sample was used to synthesize dsDNA through reverse transcription. cRNA was produced by in vitro transcription and labeled post-synthetically with Cy3 or Cy5. Probe sequences were chosen to maximize gene specificity and minimize the 3\u2032-replication bias inherent in reverse transcription of mRNA. In addition, all microarrays contained approximately 2,000 control probes for quality control purposes. All probes on the microarrays were synthesized in situ with inkjet technology (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, Calif.; Hughes et al, 2001, Nat. Biotechnol. 19:342-347). After hybridization, arrays were scanned and fluorescence intensities for each probe were recorded. Ratios of transcript abundance (experimental to control) were obtained following normalization and correction of the array intensity data. Gene expression data was analyzed using Rosetta Resolver gene expression analysis software (version 7.0, Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, Wash.) and MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, Mass.).",

The analysis shows that Nevins (activated RAS expression in HMEC) and Jacks (activated RAS expression in mouse lung) signatures, the two signatures that are based on constitutive deregulation of RAS signaling, are not coherent with p-value >0.05 based on a Fisher exact test, while our RAS signature and the Blum signature (cell line treatment with RAS inhibitor) are coherent across all the datasets.",

A heatmap based on all the genes (FIG. 2B) and a heatmap after filtering the genes (FIG. 2D) show that the \u201cUP\u201d and \u201cDOWN\u201d arms of our signature cluster apart in this dataset. Finally, FIG. 2C shows a scatter plot of the \u201cUP\u201d and \u201cDOWN\u201d arms for the signature before filtering. The p-value of the anticorrelation is significant based on the Kendall, Spearman, or Pearson correlation tests. As an example of a signature that is not coherent, FIGS. 3A, B, and C show a similar analysis done for the Nevins signature in breast cell lines. FIG. 3A demonstrates that this signature is not coherent by our coherence test with p-value >0.05. The same can be seen in FIG. 3B, in which genes from \u201cUP\u201d and \u201cDOWN\u201d arms cluster together in the heatmap. As shown in FIG. 3C, The \u201cUP\u201d and \u201cDOWN\u201d arms of this signature correlate rather than anticorrelate. This lack of coherence for the Nevins signature presents a problem for scoring their RAS signature unless we leverage an independent line of evidence to confirm the scores."

The negative sign of correlation between our RAS and Blum's RAS signatures is due to sign selection for Blum's results. We assigned the genes that are upregulated by RAS inhibitors into the \u201cDown\u201d arm and those that are downregulated by RAS inhibitors into the \u201cUp\u201d arm. One possible explanation for this observation is that the acute inhibition of RAS leads to changes in expression that are mimicking upregulated RAS signaling rather than reversing it. Nevertheless, the significance of pairwise correlations is very high with p-values based on Kendal, Pearson, or Spearman correlations lower than 10\u22129 for all but Jack's original signature. Our RAS pathway signature also showed a wide dynamic range relative to the other signatures, with scores ranging from \u22120.5 to 0.5.",

As was the case with the breast panel, we saw a negative sign of correlation between our RAS and the Blum RAS signature. The Jacks original RAS signature shows significant correlation with our RAS signature in lung and lymphoma panels, but not in the colon panel. Interestingly, the dynamic range of our RAS signature in colon panel was rather narrow for all but two cell lines, which have very negative scores (discussed below). The dynamic range in lymphoma and lung was similar to what was observed in breast."
