                        "Clostridium difficile is a Gram positive, spore forming anaerobic bacillus, and many strains of this species have acquired resistance to a majority of commonly used antibiotics. The reduction of commensal microflora as an effect of use of antibiotics allows C. difficile to grow and to produce harmful toxins in the intestine, without nutritional competition from normal bacterial flora. Transmitted primarily through contact with contaminated surfaces, C. difficile is a common cause of nosocomial antibiotics-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseuodomembranous colitis. (Cloud, J. et al. 2007 Cur Opin Gastroenterol 23:4-9). Infection caused by C. difficile accounts for millions of patient cases and billions of dollars yearly in treatment in hospitals, nursing homes and other care centers. (O'Brien, et al. November 2007 Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology 28(11): 1219-1227). Highly virulent strains of C. difficile result in increased incidence of illness and more severe effects in patients. (McDonald, et al. 2005 N Engl J Med. 353:2466-2441).",
                        "The diagnosis of C. difficile infection remains a challenge (Wilkins T D et al. 2003 J Clin Microbiol 41:531-4). The current diagnostic modalities mainly consist of the detection of the C. difficile organisms and of their toxins in fecal samples. Isolation of C. difficile from stool culture is seldom carried out clinically because it is labor-intensive and time-consuming (Bartlett J G. 2006 Ann Intern Med 145:758-64). One method commonly used is the detection of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of C. difficile, but this approach cannot distinguish the toxigenic strains from non-toxigenic ones. Other methods, such as real-time PCR for detecting bacterial genes, are under evaluation for the diagnosis of C. difficile-associated disease (Peterson L R et al. 2007 Clin Infect Dis 45:1152-60), but require sophisticated equipment and training. These assays, which detect the organism, are associated with an inherent problem in that 10% to 30% of hospitalized patients are colonized with toxigenic or non-toxigenic C. difficile without disease (McFarland L V et al. 1989 N Engl J Med 320:204-10). It is therefore more desirable to detect toxins which are thought to be the cause of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) (Kelly C P et al. 2008 N Engl J Med 359:1932-40). The widely used enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize TcdA and/or TcdB. EIAs are rapid and easy, but suffer from low to moderate sensitivity (Planche T et al. 2008 Lancet Infect Dis (12):777-84). The cytotoxin B assay is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the laboratory diagnosis of C. difficile infection due to its high sensitivity and specificity (Chang T W et al. 1979 J Infect Dis 140:765-70). The assay mainly detects the presence of TcdB, which is far more potent than TcdA in causing cytopathic changes in cultured cells. The drawbacks of cytotoxin B assay are technical complexity, slow turnaround time (24-72 h) and the requirement for a cell culture facility (Chang T W et al. 1979 J Infect Dis 140:765-70). Given the dramatic increase of cases and severity of CDAD in recent years, a rapid and easy to perform assay with high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of C. difficile infection is an urgent need.",
                        "C. difficile produces two major protein toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which are 308 kD and 269 kD respectively in size. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,826, Wilkins et al., issued Mar. 24, 1992). The two toxins belong to the large clostridial cytotoxin (LCT) family and share 49% amino acid identity. (Just, I. et al. 2004 Reviews of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology 152:23-47). The toxins have similar structures and share putative receptor binding, transmembrane, and enzymatic domains. (Schirmer, J. et al. 2004 Biochimica et Biophysica acta 1673:66-74). After receptor-mediated internalization and intracellular cleavage, the toxins glucosylate members of the Rho-Rac family of small GTPases at a specific threonine residue in host intestinal epithelial cells, leading to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, massive fluid secretion, acute inflammation, and necrosis of the colonic mucosa. TcdA is an enterotoxin and has minimal cytotoxic activity, whereas TcdB is a potent cytotoxin with limited enterotoxic activity in animals. The extensive damage to the intestinal mucosa was thought to be primarily attributable to the action of TcdA. However, TcdA and TcdB were found to act synergistically in the intestine. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,548, Wilkins et al., issued Sep. 6, 2005).",
                        "Currently, C. difficile toxins have heretofore been purified mainly from culture supernatants of toxigenic bacteria; the process presents a number of problems including cumbersome purification methods and the presence of contaminants in the resulting proteins. Production of recombinant C. difficile toxins in Escherichia coli have been attempted without success. Assays for detection of C. difficile are currently commercially available, including antigenic detection of a common bacterial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), a method that does not differentiate between toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs) for detecting TcdA and/or TcdB in stool samples are widely used. However, many immunoassay kits have limited sensitivity or are capable of detecting only one of the toxins. (Novak-Weekly, S. M. et al. 2008 Clin Vaccine Immunol; Russman, H. et al. 2007 Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 26(2): p. 115-9; Staneck, J. L. et al. 1996 J. Clin Microbiol. 34(11): p. 2718-21; Whittier, S. et al. J. Clin Microbiol. 31(11): p. 2861-5; Barbut, F., et al. J Clin Microbiol. 31(4): p. 963-7). Disadvantages of the cytotoxin B assay (CBA) that detects TcdB include technical complexity and slow turnaround time, restrict routine clinical use of the assay for diagnosis. Further, sensitivity of CBA for TcdA is very low.",
                        "The growing incidence and severity of C. difficile indicate a need for better understanding of pathogenesis in patients, and development of new assay and treatment tools and methods to obtain relatively pure and biologically active TcdA and TcdB for research. It is desirable to obtain relatively pure and biologically active TcdA and TcdB for studying the pathogenesis of CDAD and host immune response to the infection and for generating immunological tools for research and clinical diagnosis. The native toxins are usually purified from toxigenic C. difficile culture supernatant, which involves multiple steps and the purity is often unsatisfactory (Krivan H C et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(8):1873-1877; Sullivan N M et al. 1982 Infect Immun 35(3):1032-1040; Keel M K et al. 2007 Veterinary pathology 44(6):814-822). Attempts have been made to clone and express C. difficile toxins in Escherichia coli (Phelps C J et al. 1991 Infection and immunity 59(1):150-153; Tang-Feldman Y J et al. 2002 Molecular and cellular probes 16(3):179-183; Wren B W et al. 1987 FEBS letters 225(1-2):82-86), but it is unclear whether or not purified toxins were obtained from the bacterial lysate in these studies. The Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium expression system may offer an alternative for the expression of C. difficile toxins due to several advantages over the E. coli system, including the lack of alkaline proteases activity and endotoxin liposaccharides (LPS), and the ability to secrete expressed heterologous protein into the medium (Malten M et al. 2006 Applied and environmental microbiology 72(2):1677-1679; Vary P S et al. 2007 Applied microbiology and biotechnology 76(5):957-967). Burger et al. expressed purified recombinant TcdA in B. megaterium however obtained only low levels of expression (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588)). In examples herein full-length proteins of both TcdA and TcdB in B. megaterium were expressed, and an average of 5-10 mg of highly purified recombinant proteins from one liter of total bacterial culture was obtained. Both recombinant TcdA and TcdB were biologically active similar to their native purified toxins."

                        "C. difficile is a gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacterium. It is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the severity which ranges from mild diarrhea to life threatening pseudomembranous colitis (Bartlett J G. 2002 N Engl J Med 346:334-9). Pathogenic C. difficile strains excrete exotoxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) that have been intimately linked to its pathogenicity. Both TcdA and TcdB are enterotoxic, capable of inducing intestinal epithelial damage and increasing mucosal permeability, and hence are thought to be responsible for the pathogenesis of C. difficile-associated colitis (Kelly C P et al. 1998 Annu Rev Med 49:375-90). C. difficile has emerged as a leading cause of hospital-acquired enteric infections with rapidly escalating annual health care costs in the United States (Kyne L et al. 2002 Clin Infect Dis 34:346-353). The severity of C. difficile-associated infections ranges from mild diarrhea to life threatening pseudomembranous colitis (Bartlett J G et al. 2002 N Engl J Med 346:334-339; Borriello S P 1998 Antimicrob Chemother 41 Suppl C:13-19). Several hospital outbreaks of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), with high morbidity and mortality in the past few years in North America, have been attributed to the widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The emergence of more virulent C. difficile strains is also contributing to the increased incidence and severity of the disease (Loo V G et al. 2005 N Engl J Med 353:2442-2449; McDonald L C et al. 2005 N Engl J Med 353:2433-2441). Antibiotic usage results in a reduction of commensal microflora in the gut, which permits C. difficile to proliferate more extensively, leading to the production of toxins (Owens J R et al. 2008 Clinical Infectious Diseases 46(s1):S19-S31). C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) includes a range of symptoms varying from mild diarrhea to severe fulminate lethal disease (Kuijper E J et al. 2007 Curr Opin Infect Dis 20(4):376-383). Recent outbreaks of highly virulent C. difficile strains (McDonald L C et al. 2005 N Engl J Med 353(23):2433-2441; Loo V G et al. 2005 N Engl J Med 353(23):2442-2449) have increased the urgency to devote greater resources towards the understanding of the molecular, genetic, and biochemical basis for the pathogenesis, with a view to use such information to develop novel preventive and treatment modalities.",
                        "A cell-based immunocytotoxicity assay for detecting C. difficile toxins is described herein, that uses an anti-C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) monoclonal antibody, named A1H3, which substantially enhanced the activity of TcdA on Fc gamma receptor I (Fc\u03b3RI)-expressing cells (He X, Sun X, Wang J, et al. Antibody-enhanced, Fc{gamma}R-mediated endocytosis of C. difficile toxin A. Infect Immun 2009). A1H3 enhancing antibody, in combination with an electronic sensing system was used to develop a real-time and ultrasensitive assay for the detection of biological activity of C. difficile toxins. The assay was easy-to-perform and particularly sensitive for TcdA, detecting this toxin, at a level of 0.1 pg/ml to 1 pg/ml, and required a short turnaround time of about 3 h.",
                        "Toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) are the two major virulence factors contributing to pathogenic C. difficile strains. They are enterotoxic, inducing intestinal epithelial cell damage, disrupting epithelium tight junctions leading to increased mucosal permeability (Pothoulakis C et al. 2001 Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 280:G178-183; Riegler M et al. 1995 J Clin Invest 95:2004-2011; Savidge T C et al. 2003 Gastroenterology 125:413-420). Moreover, these toxins induce production of immune mediators, leading to subsequent neutrophil infiltration and severe colitis (Kelly C P et al. 1994 J Clin Invest 93:1257-1265; Kelly C P et al. 1998 Annu Rev Med 49:375-390). TcdA and TcdB are structurally homologous, and contain a putative N-terminal glucosyltransferase and a cysteine proteinase domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (von Eichel-Streiber C et al. 1996 Trends Microbiol 4:375-382) (Jank T et al. 2008 Trends in microbiology 16:222-229; Voth D E et al. 2005 Clin Microbiol Rev 18:247-263). Interaction between the toxin C-terminus and the host cell receptors is believed to initiate a receptor-mediated endocytosis (Florin I et al. 1983 Biochim Biophys Acta 763:383-392; Karlsson K A 1995 Curr Opin Struct Biol 5:622-635; Tucker K D et al. 1991 Infect Immun 59:73-78). Although the intracellular mode of action remains unclear, it has been proposed that the toxins undergo conformational change at low pH in the endosomal compartment, leading to membrane insertion and channel formation (Florin I et al. 1986 Microb Pathog 1:373-385; Giesemann T et al. 2006 J Biol Chem 281:10808-10815; Henriques B et al. 1987 Microb Pathog 2:455-463; Qa'Dan M et al. 2000 Infect Immun 68:2470-2474). A host cofactor is then required to trigger a second structural change which is accompanied by an immediate autocatalytic cleavage and release of the glucosyltransferase domain into cytosol (Pfeifer G et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278:44535-44541; Reineke J et al. 2007 Nature 446:415-419; Rupnik M et al. 2005 Microbiology 151:199-208). Once the glucosyltransferase domain reaches the cytosol, it inactivates proteins of the Rho/Rac family, leading to alterations of cytoskeleton and ultimately cell death (Just I et al. 1995 Nature 375:500-503; Sehr P et al. 1998 Biochemistry 37:5296-5304).",
                        "The clinical manifestation of CDAD is highly variable, from asymptomatic carriage, to mild self-limiting diarrhea, to the more severe pseudomembranous colitis. The prevalence of systemic complication and death in CDAD has become increasingly common (Siemann M et al. 2000 Intensive care medicine 26:416-421). In life-threatening cases of CDAD, systemic complications are observed, including cardiopulmonary arrest (Johnson S et al. 2001 Annals of internal medicine 135:434-438), acute respiratory distress syndrome (Jacob S S et al. 2004 Heart Lung 33:265-268), multiple organ failure (Dobson G et al. 2003 Intensive care medicine 29:1030), renal failure (Cunney R J et al. 1998 Nephrol Dial Transplant 13:2842-2846), and liver damage (Sakurai T et al. 2001 J Infect Dis 33:69-70). The exact reason for these complications is unclear, but entry of the toxin into the circulation and systemic dissemination have been suggested as possible causes (Hamm E E et al. 2006 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:14176-14181).",
                        "Protection against C. difficile appears to be conferred by anti-toxin antibodies, which are present in the general population among individuals over 2 years of age, and at higher levels in individuals who have suffered less severe cases with less frequent relapse (Kelly C P 1996 Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol 8:1048-1053; Kelly C P et al. 1996 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 40:373-379; Kyne L et al. 2000 N Engl J Med 342:390-397; Torres J F et al. 1995 Infect Immun 63:4619-4627; Viscidi R et al. 1983 J Infect Dis 148:93-100). Disease progression and recurrence seem to be associated with different subsets of antibodies in the circulation (Katchar K 2007 Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 5:707-713), but the reason for this observation is unknown. In animal studies, neutralizing antibodies directed against TcdA inhibit fluid secretion in mouse intestinal loops and protect mice against systemic infection (Corthier G et al. 1991 Infect Immun 59:1192-1195). Co-administration of both anti-TcdA and anti-TcdB antibodies significantly reduces mortality in a primary hamster disease model as well as in a less stringent relapse model (Babcock G J et al. 2006 Infect Immun 74:6339-6347).",
                        "The mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is unclear, but it is likely that the cellular Fc receptors (FcR) are playing some roles. Fc receptors for IgG, known as Fc\u03b3Rs, are widely distributed on effector cells of the immune system (including macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and natural killer cells), and are essential in recognition and elimination of IgG-opsonized pathogens and immune complex. The Fc\u03b3R family members include at least one high affinity receptor (Fc\u03b3RI or CD64) and two low affinity receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIA or CD32, and Fc\u03b3RIII or CD16). Binding of these surface receptors to the Fc portion of IgG activates cell signaling pathways and triggers various cellular responses, such as production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and release of inflammatory cytokines (Daeron, M 1997 Fc receptor biology Annu Rev Immunol 15:203-234; Ravetch J V et al. 2001 Annual review of immunology 19:275-290).",
                        "A feature of the present invention is a method for detecting a presence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile and/or C. difficile toxin in a biological sample, the method including steps of: contacting a first set of test cells with an aliquot of the sample and an amount of a toxin-enhancing antibody and measuring an amount of loss of cell viability for the first set of cells in comparison with an amount in a second set of the test cells not so contacted and otherwise identical, such that an amount of loss of cell viability in the first set in comparison to the second set is an indication of the presence of C. difficile or toxin in the sample. The method in related embodiments further includes contacting at least a third set of cells with at least one known amount of the C. difficile toxin as a positive control. The method in related embodiments further includes contacting at least a fourth set of cells with a different known amount of C. difficile toxin wherein a plurality of positive controls comprises a standard curve for toxin killing in the presence of the toxin-enhancing antibody. The method in related embodiments further includes adding to a duplicate of the first set of cells with the aliquot of sample and the toxin-enhancing antibody, an amount of an agent as a positive control, such that the agent can be an antibody or an anti-toxin known to neutralize at least one C. difficile toxin, such that the agent identifies the presence of the toxin, in which the presence of either TcdA or TcdB or both, is an indication of C. difficile infection. An anti-toxin is one or a group of antibodies known to respond to and/or neutralize a specific or group of toxins.",

                        "Exemplary cells to use in the assays are white blood cells. For example, the white blood cells are macrophages, for example, the macrophages are mouse RAW 264.7 cells. Additionally, the cells display a receptor for IgG, for example, a recombinantly expressed Fc gamma receptor (Fc\u03b3R). In certain embodiments, the cells are colonic epithelial cells.",

Thus in the method prior to contacting the cells, frozen cells are defrosted and are cultured prior to use. Alternatively prior to contacting the cells, fresh primary or cultured cells are harvested and used in the method. The method further involves analyzing viability data, which are available and are analyzed in less than a day, less than eight hours, less than six hours or even less than about three hours. Cells for the assay do not necessarily need to be cultured, providing a method that produces data much faster than those methods currently available. Alternatively, cultured cells are used in the assay. Alternatively, primary cells are used in the assay.",
                        "Another feature of the invention provided herein is a method of producing Clostridium toxins in a Bacillus host, the method involving the steps of: contacting a cell of a Bacillus species with a nucleic acid vector, the vector carrying: a gene encoding a Clostridium toxin protein, the gene operably linked to regulatory signals for controlling expression of the gene in the cell, such that the gene is further engineered as a nucleic acid fusion encoding a Bacillus signal sequence linked in the same reading frame as the toxin, the vector further carrying a selectable marker, to obtained transformants carrying the selectable marker; screening a plurality of the transformants for expression of toxin to obtain a transformant secreting the toxin as a full length protein; and expressing the recombinant toxin in the Bacillus cells as a secreted product. An exemplary Bacillus is B. megaterium, and an exemplary Clostridium is C. difficile. Methods for contacting a cell with a nucleic acid are well known, for example, using protoplasts of the cell made by treating the cells with lysozyme. Alternative methods of contacting cells with vectors in order to transform the cell, for example, gene gun methods, are within the scope of the invention.",

Further, the gene is obtained by polymerase chain reaction. In a related embodiment, the vector further encodes an affinity marker, and the gene encodes a fusion of the toxin protein with an amino acid sequence encoding the affinity marker. For example, the affinity marker is a poly-histidine that binds to biotin or Streptactin. For example the affinity marker is one from the group consisting of: avidin, streptavidin, and streptag. Streptag is an eight residue minimal peptide sequence that exhibits affinity for streptavidin and can be used as a fusion for purification of proteins. Having a fusion protein with either or both poly-his or streptag enables single step or two step purification to essentially homogeneity, with minimal addition to the native toxin protein.",

It was further observed that TcdA/A1H3 immune complex was more potent than TcdA alone in inactivating Rho-GTPase, disrupting the cytoskeleton, and inducing TNF-\u03b1 production.",
                        "The invention herein provides in one embodiment an assay for the presence of C. difficile cells and toxins. The inventors have discovered that certain antibodies enhance the effects of C. difficile toxins on certain mammalian cells. The toxin-enhancing antibody is generally of the IgG2a class, and the toxin sensitive mammalian test cells bear Fc\u03b3R proteins. Exemplary types of antibodies are identified as A1H3 and PCG4.1 as described herein.",
                        "An anti-TcdA MAb, A1H3, as shown herein enhances TcdA-mediated cellular effects in murine macrophages and human monocytes. The observed effects included: 1) inducing cell rounding and death; 2) inactivating small Rho-GTPase via glucosylation; and 3) eliciting TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages. The antibody-dependent enhanced cytotoxic activity of TcdA was not observed in other cell types, including the human intestinal epithelial HCT8 or HT29 cells, or murine colonic CT26 cells.",
                        "Examples herein showed an important role of Fc\u03b3RI in A1H3-dependent enhancement of TcdA toxicity. While blocking the Fc\u03b3RII/III with anti-mouse-CD16/32 antibodies did not affect the glucosylation of Rac1 in RAW 264.7, pre-saturation of Fc\u03b3RI on THP1 with anti-human-CD64 antibodies significantly reduced the level of Rac1 glucosylation. Anti-human-CD64 blocking antibodies failed to completely abolish the enhancement of TcdA activity on THP1 cells by mouse A1H3 antibody. Without being limited by any particular theory or mechanism, this result may be due to the inefficient interaction between mouse-derived A1H3 and human Fc\u03b3Rs in THP1. Additionally, pre-incubation of the TcdA/A1H3 with a recombinant mouse CD64 was observed to completely block the A1H3-mediated enhancement of the glucosyltransferase activity by TcdA in RAW 264.7 cells. Finally, the expression of Fc\u03b3RI strikingly enhanced the sensitivity of mRG1-1 cells to TcdA when complexed with A1H3. Similarly, the presence of A1H3 greatly enhanced the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdA in mRG1-1 cells. Neither cytotoxicity nor glucosyltransferase activity was enhanced by A1H3 in CHO cells, the parental line of mRG1-1.",
                        "Members of Fc\u03b3R family consist of at least three members, Fc\u03b3RI, II and III (Ravetch J V et al. 2001 Annual review of immunology 19:275-290). Murine Fc\u03b3RI has higher affinity to IgG2a than other IgG subisotypes (Gessner J E et al. 1998 Annals of hematology 76:231-248). Although Fc\u03b3RI is a high-affinity receptor capable of binding IgG monomer, a noticeable surface binding of A1H3 to RAW 264.7 only occurred when it was complexed with TcdA. This may be due to the relative low expression of Fc\u03b3RI on these cells. In fact, the monomeric A1H3 binding was detected on mRG1-1 cells, which were engineered to express high level of Fc\u03b3RI (Cho S et al. 1997 Int Immunol 9:239-248). However, the binding of TcdA with Fc\u03b3RI was significantly enhanced after its association with antigen A1H3, in comparison with those treated with TcdA alone, indicating that the presence of A1H3 facilitated recruitment of TcdA to cell surface which might consequently contribute to the antibody-dependent enhancement of toxin activity. Without being limited by any particular underlying mechanism data herein showed that A1E6, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody against TcdA, neither enhanced toxin binding to macrophages nor augmented toxin activity when complexed with TcdA. Similar to A1E6, another anti-TcdA IgG1 Mab, A1B1, had no enhancing effects.",
                        "Upon binding to Fc\u03b3Rs, the immune complexes are internalized via either phagocytosis or endocytosis. The mode of internalization is intimately linked to the size of the bound complexes (Daeron, M 1997 Fc receptor biology Annu Rev Immunol 15:203-234; Mukherjee S et al. 1997 Physiol Rev 77:759-803). Large opsonized particles are internalized by phagocytosis, while internalization of small soluble complexes most likely occurs via endocytosis. Mechanistically, the molecular process underlying the Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis and endocytosis differs dramatically. Endocytosis specifically requires the assembly of clathrin at the site of receptor clustering (Mukherjee S et al. 1997 Physiol Rev 77:759-803). Fc\u03b3RI-mediated phagocytosis, however, requires a signal-transducing \u03b3 chain that harbors tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) (Davis W et al. 1995 Embo J 14:432-441; Huang Z Y et al. 2006 J Leukoc Biol 80:1553-1562). Cells expressing Fc\u03b3RI extracellular domain (in the absence of \u03b3 subunit) are unable to phagocytose large particles, while their endocytic functions remain intact (Davis W et al. 1995 Embo J 14:432-441). In examples herein, enhancement of TcdA activity mediated by A1H3 did not require the presence of \u03b3 chain, since expression of Fc\u03b3RI \u03b1 chain alone on mRG1-1 was observed to render the cells more susceptible to A1H3-dependent enhancement of toxicity of TcdA, suggesting that the TcdA/A1H3 was taken up via Fc\u03b3RI-mediated endocytosis. The involvement of an endocytic pathway in the uptake of TcdA/A1H3 by RAW 264.7 was further supported by the observation that TcdA/A1H3-mediated Rac1 glucosylation and TNF-\u03b1 production were inhibited by chlorpromazine and ammonium chloride/chloroquine, chemicals that are known to target the endocytic pathway.",
                        "Examples herein are relevant to the relationship of antibody response in host protection and pathogenesis of C. difficile associated diseases. Toxins TcdA and TcdB are key virulence factors, and antibodies against the two toxins are highly protective (Corthier G et al. 1991 Infect Immun 59:1192-1195; Kyne L et al. 2001 Lancet 357:189-193). Intravenous administration of immunoglobulin against TcdA and TcdB to patients with recurrent or severe CDAD resulted in symptom resolution (Leung D Y et al. 1991 J Pediatr 118:633-637). A higher level of anti-TcdA antibodies following colonization or primary disease has been correlated with protection from CDAD or relapse (Kyne L et al. 2001 Lancet 357:189-193; Kyne L et al. 2000 N Engl J Med 342:390-397). Finally, vaccination of long-term relapsing humans with toxoid A and B has successfully prevented additional relapses (Sougioultzis S et al. 2005 Gastroenterology 128:764-770). However, different subsets of antibodies may have different roles in host protection and disease progression (Katchar K 2007 Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 5:707-713). While patients with recurrent CDAD do not show evidence in overall humoral immune deficiency, they do have a selectively reduced IgG2 and IgG3 response against TcdA, compared to those with single CDAD (Katchar K 2007 Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 5:707-713). Data herein showed that the IgG2a subisotype of anti-TcdA actually enhanced the toxicity of TcdA on macrophages/monocytes in vitro. Whether these findings apply for in vivo pathogenesis of C. difficile infection remains to be determined. Antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection has been widely described in mammalian viruses as well as in bacteriophages (Leopold P L et al. 2006 Journal of virology 80:10237-10247; Sapinoro R et al. 2008 Virology 373:274-286; Schlesinger J J et al. 1999 Virology 260:84-886). Instead of neutralizing or reducing viral infectivity, the presence of virus-specific antibodies paradoxically potentiates the infection of susceptible host cells, a process that is most often mediated by receptors for complement components or the Fc portion of immunoglobulins (Homsy J et al. 1989 Science 244:1357-1360; Leopold P L et al. 2006 Journal of virology 80:10237-10247; Sapinoro R et al. 2008 Virology 373:274-286; Takada A et al. 2003 Rev Med Virol 13:387-398). Given the results from examples herein, it is likely that some toxin-specific antibodies have detrimental effects on the host mediated by enhanced toxin activity. Such effects, however, yet to be illustrated in humans, or in animal models, are being investigated in our laboratory.",

                        "Two exotoxins produced by toxigenic C. difficile, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), are most extensively studied and thought to be major virulent factors of CDAD (Kelly C P et al. 1994 N Engl J Med 330(4):257-262; Voth D E et al. 2005 Clin Microbiol Rev 18(2):247-263). TcdA (308 kDa) and TcdB (269 kDa) belong to the large clostridial cytotoxin (LCT) family and share 49% amino acid identity (Just I et al. 2004 Reviews of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology 152:23-47). The two toxins have a similar structure containing a putative receptor binding domain (RBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a glucosyltransferase domain (Just I et al. 2004 Reviews of physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology 152:23-47; Schirmer J et al. 2004 Biochimica et biophysica acta 1673(1-2):66-74). After receptor-mediated internalization and intracellular cleavage, the toxins glucosylate members of the Rho-Rac family of small GTPases at a specific threonine residue in host intestinal epithelial cells, leading to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, massive fluid secretion, acute inflammation, and necrosis of the colonic mucosa (Voth D E et al. 2005 Clin Microbiol Rev 18(2):247-263). Purified TcdA possesses potent enterotoxic and pro-inflammatory activity, as determined in ligated intestinal loop studies in animals (Kurtz C B et al. 2001 Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy 45(8):2340-2347; Lyerly D M et al. 1982 Infect Immun 35(3):1147-1150). TcdA is also cytotoxic to cultured cells in a picomolar to nanomolar range. TcdB, more cytotoxic to cultured cells than TcdA, was previously reported to exhibit no enterotoxic activity in animals (Lyerly D M et al. 1982 Infect Immun 35(3):1147-1150; Lyerly D M et al. 1985 Infect Immun 47(2):349-352), but recent studies have found enterotoxic and proinflammatory activities in human intestinal xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Savidge T C et al. 2003 Gastroenterology 125(2):413-420). Furthermore, the TcdA\u2212B+ C. difficile strains are responsible for pseudomembranous colitis in some patients (Shin B M et al. 2007 Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 60(4):333-337; Kikkawa H et al. 2007 J Infect Chemother 13(1):35-38).",

CI is a parameter to describe electronic impedance, which corresponds to the number of cells attaching to the bottom of microelectrode-embedded microplate (E-plate) wells as an index of viability. In addition, the CI value was found to be positively affected by the extent of cells spreading on the bottom (Abassi Y A et al. 2004 J Immunol Methods 292:195-205). C. difficile toxins disrupt cell attachment and cause cell rounding (i.e. reduce cell spreading), thus lowering the CI values.",

Cells were either grown overnight before the addition of toxins or biological samples in the absence or presence of a saturating dose of A1H3, or mixed with these reagents directly before being added into the E-plates. To block toxin activity to confirm identity of the toxic material, rabbit antiserum against TcdA (generated for samples herein) or goat antiserum against both TcdA and TcdB (commercially available from TechLab Inc., Blacksburg, Va.) was applied.

As shown in FIG. 1 panel A, a dynamic response recorded by RT-CES revealed that A1H3 enhanced the sensitivity of mRG1-1 test cells to the cytotoxic effect of TcdA by a factor of at least 1000. A rapid decrease in CI within hours following the addition of toxins was observed in cells treated with 1000 ng/ml of TcdA, 10 ng/ml of TcdB, or TcdA at 1 ng/ml in the presence of A1H3 (FIG. 1 panel A). After 20 h of incubation, TcdA at a dose as low as 0.1 pg/ml was sufficient to render a complete loss of CI when A1H3 was present. This was in sharp contrast to the observation that TcdA alone at 10 ng/ml only resulted in a partial loss of CI as compared to the medium control (FIG. 1 panel A).",
                                "The cytotoxic effect on mRG1-1 cells by TcdA/A1H3 was completely blocked by rabbit-anti-TcdA sera, confirming that the loss of CI was TcdA-specific (FIG. 1 panel A). TcdB at doses of 10 or 1 ng/ml also sharply decreased electronic resistance, whereas a lower dose (100 pg/ml) resulted in a slow reduction of CI as a function of time (FIG. 1 panel A). Antibody A1H3 was found neither to cross-react with TcdB nor enhance its biological activity. Nevertheless, the cytotoxic effect of TcdB on mRG1-1 cells was significantly higher than that of TcdA in the absence of A1H3 (FIG. 1).",

To overcome this, the freshly thawed mRG1-1 test cells from cryopreservation were added together with the toxins to E-plates. As shown in FIG. 1 panel B, an increase in CI value over time was observed in control cells (PBS vehicle treatment). In contrast, the CI remained low when cells were treated with a mixture of TcdA and TcdB at doses of 0.1 to 1 ng/ml or higher, indicating the intoxicated cells (viz., contacted with toxin) had a reduced ability attach to the bottom of E-plates. The presence of A1H3 substantially enhanced the sensitivity of the assay, detecting toxin activity at 1 pg/ml within 4 h (FIG. 1 panel B). That cell death was due to C. difficile toxin was shown using the goat antiserum against both TcdA and TcdB, as this antiserum blocked the cytotoxic activities of the toxins and allowed cells to attach to the bottom of wells, as indicated by an increase in CI (FIG. 1 panel B).",

It has been suggested that a possible cause might be the toxins entering into circulation and disseminating systemically (Hamm E E et al. 2006 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 103:14176-81). We have observed that the severe cases of C. difficile infection in experimental piglets are associated with systemic complications. We therefore measured the toxin activities in serum from the severely infected piglets using the immunocytotoxicity assay. The serum alone failed to inhibit the increase of CI as compared to that in PBS group, suggesting that the amount of toxins in the serum, if any, was not high enough to block the cell attachment (FIG. 2 panel B).",

The inhibitory effect was reverted by anti-sera against C. difficile toxins (FIG. 2 panel B), indicating that it was indeed a result of the toxins. Similarly, the serum and pleural effusion from another severely infected piglet reduced the ascent of CI, which was reverted by the anti-serum against C. difficile toxins (FIG. 2 panel C). Furthermore, these samples caused the rounding of mRG1-1 cells after an overnight culture only when A1H3 was present. The anti-serum against the toxins blocked such cytopathic effects of these samples.",
                                "These data demonstrated that a low level of toxins disseminated in the circulation of the severely affected piglets, which might explain the systemic complications seen in these piglets. Systemic complications are also observed in severe cases of C. difficile infected human patients, but whether these complications are associated with the toxins in circulation remains to be determined. Our ultrasensitive immunocytotoxicity assay may offer such a determination.",

Compared to the \u201cgold standard\u201d Cytotoxin B assay, this method is substantially more sensitive for detecting TcdA. The assay utilized A1H3, an anti-TcdA MAb, which substantially augments the cytotoxic activity of TcdA on Fc\u03b3RI expressing cells. In addition, by utilizing freshly thawed cells and the A1H3 antibody, the turnaround time of the assay was reduced to 2-4 h. Since the cryopreserved cells were applied directly from the freezer, a cell culture facility and expertise in cell culture techniques were no longer required. A CO2 incubator was not needed when a pH-buffered medium was used. Furthermore, the assay is easy to perform. After mixing samples with cells and reagents into E-plates, the results were obtained in a real-time and automatic fashion. The immunocytotoxicity assay in the examples herein is a rapid and easy-to-perform method with superior sensitivity and specificity for detecting the biological activity of C. difficile toxins, and therefore is capable of diagnosis of C. difficile infection.",

No enhancement was detected when TcdA was complexed with MAbs A1E6 or JF1 (FIG. 6 panel B). A1H3 alone did not induce detectable TNF-\u03b1 production (FIG. 6 panel B). Since A1H3 was the only anti-TcdA MAb of IgG2a isotype, we examined another anti-TcdA IgG2a MAb, commercially available PCG4.1.

To test whether the interaction between the Fc\u03b3R and A1H3 is involved in the antibody-dependent enhancement of toxin activity in macrophages, the Fc-binding sites on Fc\u03b3RII/III and those on Fc\u03b3RI were pre-saturated with specific anti-CD16/32 or anti-CD64 antibodies, respectively. Because antibody capable of blocking/neutralizing mouse CD64 is not available, we used anti-human CD64 antibody on THP1 cells and examined the Rac1 glucosylation following the addition of TcdA/A1H3 immune complex. Pre-saturation of Fc\u03b3RII/III with anti-CD16/32 antibodies did not affect the glucosylation of Rac1 in RAW 264.7 (FIG. 7 panel A). In contrast, a reduced level of Rac1 glucosylation was observed in THP1 cells treated with Fc\u03b3RI-specific antibodies (anti-CD64) followed by incubation with TcdA/A1H3 immune complex, when compared with the non-treated cultures (FIG. 7 panel B). Moreover, pre-incubation of TcdA/A1H3 complex with a recombinant mouse CD64 completely abrogated the glucosyltransferase activity mediated by TcdA/A1H3 (FIG. 7 panel C).",

CHO cells normally do not express Fc\u03b3R and are relatively resistant to the TcdA-mediated Rac1 glucosylation and cytotoxicity. The data showed that, while CHO and mRG1-1 responded similarly to high dose of TcdA (500 ng/ml) with respect to Rac1 glucosylation, loss of the Rac1 band induced by TcdA at lower than 10 ng/ml was demonstrated in only mRG1-1 treated with TcdA/A1H3 immune complex, but not CHO cells (FIG. 7 panels D and E). No difference in Rac1 glucosylation in CHO cells compared to mRG1-1 cells was observed when A1E6 was used to complex with TcdA (FIG. 7 panels D and E). Furthermore, A1H3 greatly augmented the cytotoxic activity of TcdA in mRG1-1. As shown in FIG. 7 panel F, the presence of A1H3 did not affect the killing of wild type CHO cells by TcdA. In contrast, the expression of Fc\u03b3RI-\u03b1 chain alone strikingly enhanced the sensitivity of mRG1-1 to the cytotoxic effect of TcdA when complexed with A1H3, as compared to those treated with TcdA alone. mRG1-1 cells were more resistant to TcdA than CHO cells, since TcdA at 10 ng/ml did not noticeably induce cell death of mRG1-1 cells (FIG. 7 panel F). A rabbit anti-TcdA neutralized serum completely blocked cytotoxicity in mRG1-1 cells induced by TcdA/A1H3 complex (FIG. 7 panel F), indicating that cell death was mediated by TcdA.",

Soluble antigen-antibody immune complexes are most likely internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Norman J C et al. 2000 FEBS letters 484:179-183). To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the Fc\u03b3RI-mediated, A1H3-dependent enhancement of TcdA toxicity, we applied a panel of reagents that target various stages of the endocytic pathway. Chlorpromazine specifically inhibits the clathrin-coated pit formation at the plasma membrane. Pre-incubation of RAW 264.7 with chlorpromazine reduced the level of Rac1 glucosylation by TcdA/A1H3 immune complex (FIG. 10 panel A). Ammonium chloride and chloroquine, which prevent endosomal acidification, decreased the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdA/A1H3 (FIG. 10 panel A), supporting that the internalization of TcdA/A1H3 immune complex was mediated via receptor-mediated endocytosis.",
                                "One of the TcdA-mediated effects on macrophages is the production of TNF-\u03b1. As expected, chlorpromazine and chloroquine completely abolished TNF-\u03b1 synthesis by TcdA/A1H3 immune complex in RAW 264.7 cells (FIG. 10 panel B). While ammonium chloride did not induce TNF-\u03b1 production nor affected the cytokine response elicited by LPS, the presence of ammonium chloride at 20 mM completely blocked TcdA/A1H3 complex induced cytokine secretion (FIG. 10 panel C). The inhibitory effects of chlorpromazine and chloroquine but not by LPS on TNF-\u03b1 production by TcdA/A1H3 further support the view that TcdA/A1H3 enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

The reduced recognition of Rac1 did not result from protein degradation, because amount of total Rac1 protein remained unchanged as determined by Western blot with an antibody (clone 23A8) recognizing both glucosylated and unmodified Rac1. Each of rTcdA and nTcdA at 40 ng/ml resulted in a complete glucosylation of Rac1 whereas 8 ng/ml or 1.6 ng/ml of TcdA led to a partial glucosylation. Exposure to rTcdB or nTcdB resulted in a complete glucosylation of Rac1 at a dose range from 0.4 ng/ml-2 ng/ml (FIG. 15 panel B), indicating that the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdB was more potent than TcdA. These results were consistent with the activity of native C. difficile toxins in which TcdB is more toxic to cultured cells than TcdA.

Lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and NH4Cl can inhibit toxin-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that endosomal acidification is involved in toxin intracellular trafficking (Henriques B et al. 1987 Microbial pathogenesis 2(6):455-463; Jefferson K K et al. 1999 J Immunol 163(10):5183-5191). To determine whether or not the cellular activity of the recombinant toxins also requires endosomal acidification, CT26 cells were pre-incubated with NH4Cl for 30 min before the toxin exposure. While the exposure of CT26 cells to rTcdA or rTcdB induced the glucosylation of Rac1, pretreatment of cells with ammonium chloride was observed to have completely blocked such an activity (FIG. 15 panel C).",

                                "TcdA and TcdB alter the structure of intestinal epithelia by disrupting tight junctions (Nusrat A et al. 2001 Infect Immun 69(3):1329-1336). Therefore whether or not the recombinant toxins herein have similar activities was investigated. Human intestinal epithelial HCT-8 cells were cultured in a transwell for 10 to 14 days until transepithelial resistance (TER) reached 1000 \u03a9*cm2 and tight junctions were formed (FIG. 16 panel A). Purified rTcdA was observed not to alter cell-cell connections of HCT-8 cells within 4 h of treatment (FIG. 16 panels B and C) but to disrupt tight junctions after 6 h of treatment (FIG. 16 panel D). Purified rTcdB, at the same concentration with rTcdA, was observed to completely disrupt the tight junctions of HCT-8 within 2 h of treatment (FIG. 16 panels E and F).",
                                "CDAD is largely attributed to the bacterial exotoxins TcdA and TcdB, although other virulence factors probably also play some roles (Voth D E et al. 2005 Clin Microbiol Rev 18(2):247-263). Both toxins glycosylate Rho GTPase family proteins, leading to their inactivation (Cloud J et al. 2007 Curr Opin Gastroenterol 23(1):4-9; Voth D E et al. 2005 Clin Microbiol Rev 18(2):247-263). To study the pathogenesis of CDAD and host immune response to the toxins, and to use the toxins as a research tool for signal transduction involving Rho GTPases, it is necessary to obtain large quantities of highly purified active TcdA and TcdB. Native toxins can be purified from toxigenic C. difficile culture supernatant. The purification process prior to the present methods however has involved multiple steps such as ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ion-exchange chromatography (Sullivan N M et al. 1982 Infect Immun 35(3):1032-1040; Keel M K et al. 2007 Veterinary pathology 44(6):814-822). In the case of TcdA, affinity purification through thyroglobulin is available and relatively pure TcdA can be obtained (Krivan H C et al. 1987 Infect Immun 55(8):1873-1877 and unpublished data). TcdB however is often contaminated with unknown substances even after extensive purification steps (Keel M K et al. 2007 Veterinary pathology 44(6):814-822). The E. coli system is popular and is widely used for the expression of recombinant proteins. Several studies have reported to have cloned and expressed active C. difficile toxins in E. coli, but failed to demonstrate that the purified toxins were obtained from bacterial extracts (Phelps C J et al. 1991 Infection and immunity 59(1):150-153; Tang-Feldman Y J et al. 2002 Molecular and cellular probes 16(3):179-183; Wren B W et al. 1987 FEBS letters 225(1-2):82-86). Recombinant TcdB, however, has not previously been stably expressed in B. megaterium, while only low levels of expressed TcdA have previously been observed (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588). In examples herein a full-length recombinant TcdB in B. megaterium was expressed at high levels, and greatly enhanced levels of recombinant TcdA were also produced.",
                                "Because E. coli expression system is widely used and easy-to-handle, various E. coli expression vector systems were first chosen to clone and express both toxins. However, data showed that both recombinant TcdA and TcdB were expressed in E. coli purified toxins could not be obtained from the bacterial lysate. The large size of the heterologous proteins may possibly be prone to protease digestion, and intrinsic protease activities of these toxins may also contribute to the instability (Reineke J et al. 2007 Nature 446(7134):415-419; Egerer M et al. 2007 The Journal of biological chemistry 282(35):25314-25321). Another possible reason for the inability to obtain purified recombinant toxins from E. coli is that the expression level was too low. In fact, large proteins are difficult to express at high levels in E. coli. Furthermore, an unusually high content of AT (\u02dc70%) in these clostridial gene sequences and a different codon usage make them particularly difficult to express at a high level in E. coli (Makoff A J et al. 1989 Nucleic acids research 17(24):10191-10202; Makoff A J et al. 1989 Biotechnology 7:1043-1046).",
                                "Several advantages are associated with B. megaterium expression system including lack of alkaline phosphatase and endotoxin LPS. Initially, the reported cloning strategy was attempted but was unsuccessful (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588). This might be due to the extremely low ligation when putting several fragments together during the cloning efficiency (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588). The strategy herein was changed to using a direct PCR amplification of whole toxin genes. However, this strategy was associated with a potential risk that PCR might introduce mutations due to the large size of the genes (7101 bp and 8133 bp for tcdB and tcdA respectively). Because of the large size of both genes, obtaining a sequence of all constructs in order to identify the correct clones was not practicable. Therefore, a functional approach, screening for recombinant protein expression and cytotoxicity, was taken. As many colonies as possible (more than 90) were screened after ligation and then the resulting constructed shuttle vectors were transformed into B. megaterium protoplasts. Selected colonies were subjected to screening again by examining the cytotoxic activity in bacterial crude extracts. The specific expression of recombinant toxins from the positive colonies (with cytotoxic activity) was then determined by Western blot. The plasmids encoding tcdA or tcdB respectively were finally subjected to DNA sequencing and no single mutation was found in either of the toxin genes.",
                                "The average yields of recombinant TcdA and TcdB were about 5 mg/ml-10 mg/ml of bacterial culture, which is much greater than that of native toxins from C. difficile culture, and up to 20-fold higher than the amount of rTcdA reported (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588). The fact that a different shuttle vector was used from that of previous attempts (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588) might explain our higher yields of recombinant proteins. In addition, a twelve- to sixteen-hour period of induction with xylose yielded more recombinant proteins than five hours as suggested by the manufacturer. The other possible explanation was that the tcdA gene was fused into orfl of the vector in the construct previously reported (Burger S et al. 2003 Biochem Biophys Res Commun 307(3):584-588), resulting in a gene encoding modified N-terminus of recombinant TcdA. This modification might affect the efficiency of protein expression and/or its stability. The tcdA or tcdB gene was here inserted into the BsrGI site and the protein translation directly started from toxin gene, resulting in recombinant toxins without any N-terminal modification.",
                                "To facilitate purification, a His6 tag was fused to the C-terminus of both toxins. One-step purification with a Ni-affinity chromatography resulted in approximately 70-80% purity of recombinant toxins as determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE (FIG. 1 and data not shown). To achieve a greater purity, an additional step was introduced after Ni-affinity chromatography. For rTcdA, thyroglobulin affinity purification was used. rTcdB was further purified by an anion-exchange fractionation (FIG. 11 panel B). These additional purification steps for rTcdA and rTcdB, respectively, led to highly pure recombinant toxins. No additional band was seen on a Coomassie-stained gel (FIG. 11 panel B for rTcdB, and FIG. 12 panel A for rTcdA). In addition, no detectable TLR2 or TLR4 stimulants were observed within the purified recombinant toxins as determined by sensitive bioassays. This is important because use of impure proteins to study host immune response or signaling transduction would possibly result in artificial results and unintended consequences.",
                                "A protein secretory pathway is present in B. megaterium (Malten M et al. 2006 Applied and environmental microbiology 72(2):1677-1679; Vary P S et al. 2007 Applied microbiology and biotechnology 76(5):957-967). A 28-amino-acid signal peptide of B. megaterium extracellular esterase LipA can direct the transport of expressed heterologous proteins into medium and the sequence is removed by a protease after secretion (Malten M et al. 2006 Applied and environmental microbiology 72(2):1677-1679). Because of the nature of exotoxins of native toxins and relatively easy purification from supernatant without the need for sonication or other means of cell disruptions, expression of rTcdB was sought extracellularly. After inserting the gene of the leader signaling peptide at the 5\u2032 of tcdB, we were able to generate active secretory rTcdB (FIG. 3D) and Coomassie staining of concentrated supernatant on a SDS-PAGE gel and western blot showed rTcdB band (FIG. 11 panel D). However, for some unknown reasons, the expression level of rTcdB was significantly decreased when the leader sequence was introduced to the construct. In addition, the secretion was observed to be inefficient as toxin molecules were observed trapped within the bacteria, and the bacterial lysate contained toxin activity. The partition of rTcdB in the medium and the cytoplasm might also be due to the inefficient refolding after their extracellular transport.",
                                "Examples herein demonstrate full-length recombinant C. difficile toxin A and B proteins successfully expressed in B. megaterium and great improvement in the yield of the recombinant toxins has. About 5 mg-10 mg of highly purified rTcdA or rTcdB was obtained from one liter of bacterial culture. These recombinant toxins had similar biological activities with their native counterparts. The recombinant toxin proteins provide an invaluable tool for studying the pathogenesis of C. difficile associated disease and host immune response to toxins, as well as tools for studying the signaling transduction involving Rho GTPase family proteins."
