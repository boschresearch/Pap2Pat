    "title": "Renal Intercalated Cells Sense and Mediate Inflammation via the P2Y14 Receptor",
    "date": "2015-03-23",
    "abstract": "Uncontrolled inflammation is one of the leading causes of kidney failure. Pro-inflammatory responses can occur in the absence of infection, a process called sterile inflammation. Here we show that the purinergic receptor P2Y14 (GPR105) is specifically and highly expressed in collecting duct intercalated cells (ICs) and mediates sterile inflammation in the kidney. P2Y14 is activated by UDP-glucose, a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) released by injured cells. We found that UDP-glucose increases pro-inflammatory chemokine expression in ICs as well as MDCK-C11 cells, and UDP-glucose activates the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway in MDCK-C11 cells. These effects were prevented following inhibition of P2Y14 with the small molecule PPTN. Tail vein injection of mice with UDP-glucose induced the recruitment of neutrophils to the renal medulla. This study identifies ICs as novel sensors, mediators and effectors of inflammation in the kidney via P2Y14.",

                "Kidney failure is almost always associated with uncontrolled inflammation [1,2]. A link between renal inflammation and signaling via purinergic receptors has been established, but very little is currently known about the underlying mechanisms involved and how to prevent and alleviate the severe damage cause by inflammation. Numerous purinergic receptors are expressed in the kidney, and deregulation of purinergic signaling is associated with several pathologies, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, diabetic nephropathy and glomerulonephritis [3,4]. Purinergic receptors are involved in the regulation of water, electrolyte, and volume homeostasis by collecting duct principal cells [5\u20138]. However, there is limited knowledge on the purinergic regulation of the other major cell type of the collecting duct, the intercalated cell (IC). ICs participate in the maintenance of acid/base homeostasis via the proton-pumping V-ATPase [9,10]. In the epididymis, ATP and adenosine are potent activators of V-ATPase-dependent proton secretion in clear cells, which are analogous to ICs [11]. Extracellular ATP stimulates bone resorption in osteoclasts, a process that also requires activity of the V-ATPase [12,13]. These studies suggest a role for the purinergic regulation of acid/base transport in the kidney, but the purinergic receptor signature of ICs still remains to be characterized.",
                "Nucleotide-activated purinergic receptors are separated into two families, P2X receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels, and P2Y receptors that are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) [5\u20137]. Based on its homology with other P2 receptors, p2y5 was initially proposed to be a nucleotide-receptor, but it was subsequently shown to be insensitive to nucleotides [14] and to bind lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) [15]. Similarly, p2y10 is a lysophospholipid receptor that is not activated by nucleotides [16]. The P2Y14 receptor (also known as GPR105) is the most recent addition to the P2Y receptor family [17,18]. P2Y14 is specifically activated by nucleotide sugars including UDP-glucose and it is insensitive to ADP/ATP and UTP [18]. While UDP-glucose is used in the metabolism of nucleotide sugars, it is also released by cells and acts as an autocrine activator of the P2Y14 receptor. Most nucleotides are rapidly degraded by ectonucleotidases after their release, but UDP-glucose resists hydrolysis by these enzymes [19]. While virtually all cells release nucleotides under basal conditions [20], this release can be accentuated in response to stimuli leading to activation of purinergic receptors [21]. UDP-glucose, extracellular ATP and adenosine are emerging as immune-regulatory factors known as DAMPs (damage associated molecular pattern) molecules [22,23]. DAMPs initiate sterile inflammatory reactions, as opposed to PAMP (pathogen associated molecular patterns), which perpetuate infectious pro-inflammatory responses [23\u201326].",
                "The role of P2Y14 as an inflammatory mediator was suggested based on its high expression levels in immune cells, and on the increased release of its ligand, UDP-glucose, by damaged cells [17,20,27\u201332]. In addition to immune cells, several tissues including the brain, the gastro-intestinal tract, the kidney and the lung express P2Y14 mRNA [18]. Patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma secrete high amounts of UDP-glucose in their lungs [27,33], and P2Y14 activation by UDP-glucose in airway epithelial cells leads to IL-8 secretion [34]. Furthermore, injection of UDP-glucose into the mouse uterus induces the recruitment of neutrophils into the endometrium [35]. Another indication of the inflammatory role of P2Y14 is the up-regulation of its mRNA expression by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [35,36]. However, while purinergic signaling has been established in the modulation of renal inflammation, the role of P2Y14 in mediating immune responses in the kidney has not been described. The objective of this study was, therefore, to examine the potential participation of this receptor in the initiation of inflammation in the kidney.",
                "In this study we uncover elevated expression of a restricted number of P2 receptors in ICs, most notably P2Y14. Moreover, P2Y14 expression was not detectable in other renal epithelial cells. We also provide evidence that P2Y14 activation by UDP-glucose induces a pro-inflammatory response in ICs that is mediated by activation of the MAPK pathway. This is followed by increased expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines in ICs, and subsequent neutrophil infiltration in the renal medulla. Thus, we have identified a novel inflammatory role for renal ICs via P2Y14 signaling."

Quantitative PCR showed a marked enrichment of mRNA transcripts specific for the V-ATPase B1 subunit (a marker of A-ICs, B-ICs and CNT cells) [48\u201350], AE1 (a marker of A-ICs) [51] and pendrin (a marker of B-ICs) [52,53] in EGFP(+) cells compared to EGFP(\u2212) cells isolated from the same regions (Fig. 2A). As expected, an increase in AE1 mRNA and a decrease in pendrin mRNA were detected in EGFP(+) cells isolated from the medulla versus the cortex, respectively, demonstrating the enrichment of A-ICs in the medullary EGFP(+) cells versus cortical EGFP(+) cell populations. Quantitative PCR showed significantly higher expression levels for P2X4, P2Y2 and P2Y14 in EGFP(+) cells isolated from the medulla compared to the cortex (Fig. 2B). P2X5 and p2y5 expression appeared to be similar in both regions and P2Y1 was detectable only in cortical EGFP(+) cells, suggesting that A-ICs most probably do not express P2Y1. The very high P2Y14 enrichment (by more than 20 fold) that we measured in medullary EGFP(+) cells compared to cortical EGFP(+) cells prompted us to further characterize the role of this receptor in ICs."

                        "Double-immunofluorescence labeling of kidney sections for P2Y14 (green) and the V-ATPase B1 subunit (red) showed specific expression of P2Y14 in A-ICs and B-ICs in the cortex, while no P2Y14 was detected in the distal and connecting tubules (Fig. 3A). In the medulla, P2Y14 was detected only in A-ICs (Fig. 3B). P2Y14 was expressed in the apical region of both A-ICs and B-ICs, as compared to the V-ATPase B1 subunit, which is apical in A-ICs, but basolateral or bi-polar in B-ICs [48]. Pre-incubating the P2Y14 antibody with its immunizing peptide abolished the P2Y14 staining in both the cortex (Fig. 3C) and medulla (Fig. 3D). P2Y14 was also detected in occasional immune cells, which remained attached to the blood vessel walls (data not shown), consistent with its previously described localization in circulating immune cells [30\u201332]. Immunoblotting of EGFP(+) cell extracts with the P2Y14 antibody showed a predominant 50-KDa band and a weaker 40-kDa band (Fig. 4A). We then performed a radiolabeled UDP-glucose binding assay using total membranes separated from FACS isolated EGFP(+) cells and EGFP(\u2212) cells (Fig. 4B). The [3H]UDP-glucose binding measured in EGFP(+) cells was displaced with a saturating concentration of cold UDP-glucose [10\u20135 M], but not with ATP [10\u20135 M], showing UDP-glucose-specific binding. In contrast, in EGFP(\u2212) cells no UDP-glucose-specific binding was measured. Altogether, these data show that ICs are the only renal epithelial cells that express P2Y14."

                        "To determine whether P2Y14 activation induces the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mRNAs in ICs in vivo, we injected B1-EGFP mice through the tail vein with either a saline solution (sham) or a solution containing 100 \u03bcM UDP-glucose. Kidneys were harvested 4 h later and processed for FACS isolation of EGFP(+) cells, mRNA extraction and real-time PCR to measure pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine expression. To avoid contamination of blood immune cells, which also express P2Y14, we flushed the blood out of the kidneys by perfusing mice with PBS through the cardiac left ventricle. In addition, maximum purity (>95%) of EGFP(+) cells was obtained by restricting the sorting parameters to isolate only the brightest EGFP(+) cells. Cytospin smears of EGFP(+) cells immunostained for CD45 (a marker of leukocytes) did not show any contamination of the samples with leukocytes (data not shown). We were thus confident that any changes in pro-inflammatory mediator expression following P2Y14 activation with UDP-glucose were attributed to the presence of the receptor in ICs uniquely. As shown in Fig. 5, the neutrophil chemo-attractants, CXCL1 (KC) and CXCL2 (MIP-2\u03b1) (both murine homologues of IL-8) had significantly higher expression levels following UDP-glucose treatment in vivo for 4 hours. A significant increase was also observed for the monocyte chemo-attractant CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL3 (MIP-1\u03b1). No effect was observed after 2, 6, or 12 hours (data not shown). In addition, no significant changes were observed for CCL4, CCL5, TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and IL6 expression at any time point. These results show that ICs produce pro-inflammatory mediators in vivo following activation by a pro-inflammatory agonist, and that this process can be efficiently promoted through UDP-glucose/P2Y14 signaling."

                        "We then used the Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) subclone C11 (MDCK-C11) as a renal epithelial cell model for the initial identification and characterization of the P2Y14 signaling pathway. MDCK-C11 cells were previously shown to possess some characteristics of ICs, including Cl\u2212 and H+ secretion and the activation of H+ secretion by cAMP [54]. In agreement with this notion, RT-PCR analysis showed expression of markers of ICs, including the V-ATPase B1 and a4 subunits in these cells (Fig. 6A). AQP2, a marker of collecting duct principal cells, was not detected, supporting their non-principal cell phenotype [54]. MDCK-C11 cells did not express AE1 and thus do not retain all characteristics of A-ICs. However, expression in MDCK-C11 cells of the V-ATPase B1 and A subunits was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting, in total cell lysates and in a biotinylated plasma membrane protein fraction (Fig. 6B). The same membranes were re-blotted for actin. The absence of actin staining in the plasma membrane preparation showed the absence of biotin contamination of intracellular proteins in this fraction. RT-PCR analysis showed transcripts specific for P2Y1, P2Y4, p2y10, P2Y12 and P2Y14 (Fig. 6C). With the exception of P2X2 all other P2X receptors were also detected. Western blotting analysis showed expression of P2Y14 protein in total cell lysates and at the cell surface (Fig. 6D). In agreement with a previous report in glioma C6 cells [55], we detected a more diffuse band at higher molecular weight in the plasma membrane compared to the 50 kDa band in total cell lysates, indicating that only the glycosylated receptor can reach the cell surface. Glycosylation of P2Y14 was confirmed by PNGaseF treatment, which resulted in the appearance of the deglycosylated form of P2Y14 at around 45KDa in total cell lysates and in cell surface protein extracts. Confocal microscopy showed P2Y14 localization in the apical plasma membrane (red), which was biotinylated and labeled with biotin (green) in MDCK-C11 cells grown on filters (Fig. 6E). P2Y14 is also expressed in the sub-apical region of the cells. We then investigated the functionality of the receptor in MDCK-C11 cells by using a radiolabeled UDP-glucose binding assay. The specificity of UDP-glucose binding was analyzed by dose-displacement of [3H]UDP-glucose in the presence of unlabeled UDP-glucose or ATP. As shown in Fig. 6F, the addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled UDP-glucose diminished [3H]UDP-glucose binding in a dose-dependent manner. Concentrations of ATP of up to 10 \u03bcM had no significant inhibitory effect on the [3H]UDP-glucose binding. Scatchard analysis of the binding shows only one class of binding site with an affinity of 11.5 \u00b1 1.3 nM and a maximal binding capacity of 16.0 0.2 pmol/mg of protein. These values are very similar to the values obtained in HEK-293 cells expressing P2Y14 (previously known as KIAA0001) [18]."

B1-EGFP mice were challenged with a tail-vein injection of either 100 \u03bcM UDP-glucose (treated) or saline (sham), as discussed above. Mice were perfused 48 h later through the cardiac left ventricle with PBS to flush the blood out of the kidney vessels and hence measure only tissue infiltrated immune cells. This approach identified a significant and selective accumulation of neutrophils in the kidney medulla (Fig. 9A). This observation is consistent with the upregulation of neutrophil chemo-attractants observed in EGFP(+) cells after UDP-glucose activation. Anti-inflammatory (Ly6C low) monocytes also slightly decreased in the medulla, but no other significant changes in other immune cell counts were observed. In the kidney cortex, the numbers of most cell types remained unchanged upon UDP-glucose treatment, except for the Ly6C low monocyte population, which decreased slightly (Fig. 9B).

                "In this study, we characterized the P2 receptor profile of renal intercalated cells, and showed that they express high levels of the pro-inflammatory P2Y14 receptor. In addition, our data demonstrate that P2Y14 activation by UDP-glucose in ICs induces an inflammatory response mediated by chemokine upregulation and neutrophil recruitment into the kidney medulla. Neutrophil recruitment was demonstrated using two complementary approaches: quantitative flow cytometry analysis, and immunofluorescence microscopic visualization of Ly6G-positive neutrophils on kidney sections. Our study, therefore, identifies ICs as potential sensors, mediators and effectors of sterile inflammation in the kidney. Our data suggest that the contribution of this novel pathway should now be examined in different models of kidney disease.",
                "While we detected numerous P2 receptors in mRNA samples isolated from the entire kidney, we found only 6 (P2X1, P2X4, P2X5, P2Y2, p2y5 and P2Y14) receptors in ICs. The expression of P2Y2 in these cells is in agreement with a previous pharmacological study showing functional P2Y2 in the apical membrane of ICs in rabbit CCDs [59]. P2Y2 is traditionally viewed as a regulator of collecting duct principal cells, but our data further support its participation in IC function. Activation of this receptor by UTP, ATP and guanosine activates the ERK1-2/MAPK pathway in astrocytes [60], and it would be interesting to determine whether P2Y2 plays a similar role in ICs. Interestingly, while P2X7 and P2X6 have been described in collecting ducts [61,62], we did not detect these receptors in EGFP(+) cells, illustrating the importance of conducting cell-specific gene expression analysis. Among the receptors that were detected in ICs, P2X4 is regulated by extracellular pH [63] and it will be interesting to determine its role in the acidifying function of ICs. We also observed several purinergic receptors, including P2Y14, in MDCK-C11 cells, making them suitable models to characterize this receptor in vitro. Nonetheless, the limitations of cell culture models in general must be considered when comparing in vitro studies with the in vivo situation. The presence of other purinergic receptors, either in ICs or in MDCK-C11 cells, should not affect the outcome of the present study, because the agonist used here, UDP-glucose, was shown to activate P2Y14 exclusively.",
                "Infection and ischemic kidney injury stimulate a potent inflammatory response including a rapid infiltration of neutrophils into the affected tissue [64]. Ascending pathogens induce renal epithelial cell damage [65\u201367]. The role of ICs in the defense against these pathogens has recently emerged by the discovery that they express the antimicrobial agent RNAse 7 and its modulator, the ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) [68\u201370]. It was proposed that ICs are involved in the maintenance of luminal sterility in the kidney. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli can adhere to the apical surface of medullary ICs, where it activates TLR4-dependent and independent signaling pathways [71]. In a more recent study, ICs were shown to limit renal bacterial infection via TLR4 activation, followed by stimulation of the NF-kB pathway and release of the bacteriostatic LCN2 (also known as NGAL) and protons into the lumen [72]. Multiple other studies have characterized Toll-like receptors (TLR) as pathogen recognition and inflammation mediators in the kidney [71,73,74]. However, the molecular mechanisms that stimulate inflammation secondary to \"pathogen-free\" kidney diseases, nephrotoxicity and renal transplantation among others are poorly understood. Our present study provides evidence for a parallel non-TLR mediated inflammatory pathway determined by ICs. We suggest that the UDP-glucose released from damaged cells activates P2Y14 in ICs to initiate an inflammatory response via the production of pro-inflammatory chemokines, which then recruit neutrophils to damaged and/or infected areas. We did not detect P2Y14 in neutrophils, so it is unlikely that UDP-glucose acted directly on these cells to induce chemotaxis in an autocrine manner. We, therefore, propose that P2Y14 receptors act as danger sensors in kidney ICs. Intriguingly we found that P2Y14 mRNA expression is 20 times higher in medullary ICs compared to cortical ICs, despite the fact that immunostaining detected abundant protein in both cortical and medullary ICs. This could reflect a higher level of mRNA expression in A-type ICs, which are enriched in the isolated medullary preparation compared to the cortical EGFP(+) cells. Alternatively, the renal medulla is the primary site of exposure to urinary ascending pathogens, which induce renal epithelial cell damage [65\u201367]. The large amount of P2Y14 mRNA seen in this region could be explained by the necessity to synthetize a functional protein immediately following infection, in order to induce a rapid inflammatory response. It will be interesting to test the possibility that the ascending bacteria themselves might release UDP-glucose into the luminal compartment, thereby initiating an inflammatory response in ICs secondary to infections.",
                "P2Y14 activates the MAPK pathway, which regulates the stability of IL-8 mRNA as opposed to LPS, which transcriptionally activates the IL-8 gene via the NF-kB pathway [75]. In agreement with this notion, we show here that UDP-glucose administered both in vitro and in vivo induces a potent inflammatory response in ICs by up-regulating pro-inflammatory chemokine expression through MAPK activation and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils into the renal medulla. This would suggest that P2Y14 (MAPK activation) and LPS (mainly NF-kB activation) act in parallel to increase IL-8 secretion and neutrophil recruitment. Alternatively, P2Y14 receptor activation was previously shown to reduce adenylyl cyclase activity leading to reduction of intracellular cAMP [24] and increase of intracellular calcium [34]. Future studies will be required to determine the role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in mediating some of the inflammatory effects observed here. We have previously shown that cAMP induces the apical accumulation of V-ATPase in type A ICs [76]. It will be interesting to determine whether a reduction in cAMP in response to P2Y14 receptor activation would \"switch\" the phenotype of ICs from being proton secreting cells to pro-inflammatory mediators.",
                "Cytokines are important contributors to the initiation of inflammation in the injured kidney. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL6 and IL1\u03b2 induce chemokines through complementary activation, and the NF-kB and TLR related pathways. In our study we show that the increase in neutrophil and monocyte chemo-attractants is not accompanied by an increase of IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 or IL6 expression in ICs, indicating that UDP-glucose can itself act as a pro-inflammatory mediator bypassing the cytokine effects. We suggest that by their ability to produce chemokines, ICs act as immune defense cells by creating a chemotaxic gradient favorable to neutrophil recruitment.",
                "The increase in the amount of infiltrated neutrophils that we observed in the kidney medulla following UDP-glucose administration is in quantitative agreement with previous studies showing a 3-fold increase in renal neutrophil content after bilateral ischemia-reperfusion [77], and a 4-fold increase in the mouse uterus after UDP-glucose administration [35]. In addition, we found significant neutrophil infiltration after 48 hours, a time course identical to the infiltration observed in the mouse uterus [35].",
                "In conclusion, our data suggest that ICs are DAMP sensors that mediate the recruitment of pro-inflammatory neutrophils to the kidney via activation of P2Y14. Almost all kidney diseases trigger a strong inflammatory response that can ultimately lead to kidney failure. Our study, therefore, identifies P2Y14 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of sterile inflammation (and potentially pathogen-associated inflammation) in the kidney. In this context, we are currently examining whether the UDP-glucose/P2Y14 signaling pathway is involved in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human kidney."
