- embodiments and advantages of MORIARTY

### EXAMPLES

- introduce MORIARTY system
- describe Example 1: MORIARTY simultaneously detects DNase and RNase fluorescence
- detail experimental conditions and results for Example 1
- introduce T7-MORIARTY system
- describe Example 2: amplification-free, direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA via MORIARTY
- detail experimental conditions and results for Example 2
- describe Example 3: attomolar detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with amplification-coupled MORIARTY
- detail experimental conditions and results for Example 3

### Material and Methods

- clone and reprogram L1Csm effector module plasmid
- express and purify L1Csm complexes
