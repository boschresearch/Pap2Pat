The fluorescent dyes are heterorotaxanes that include large macrocyclic rings around fluorophores and are capable of emitting solid-state fluorescence.

The practice infringes on intellectual property and impinges detrimentally on society, especially in the arenas of health (2), commerce, and finance (3). A variety of security technologies (4) have already been developed using innovative security printing materials (5) as crucial anti-counterfeiting measures to deter counterfeiters. Although fluorescent dyes, which can be applied easily to different surfaces inexpensively, have been implemented widely to protect high-value merchandise, government documents, and banknotes, these dyes are familiar to counterfeiters. In response, next-generation fluorescent dyes with properties such as multi-color emission (6, 7), luminescence up-conversion (8), fluorescent lifetime encoding and decoding (9), and stimulus-responsive color-tuning (10, 11) have all been suggested as ways to counteract forgery.",
                        "Important considerations, when designing fluorescent security dyes, include (i) tunable emission wavelengths, (ii) stimulus-responsive properties, (iii) susceptibility to mimicry, as well as accessibility, compatibility with current printing technologies and cost. Solid-state fluorescent dyes with tunable (9, 12) and stimulus-responsive (13-15) emission wavelengths remain challenging to design. Most of the current dyes, which exhibit stimulus-induced spectroscopic changes, are crystalline with slow response times and narrow tunable wavelength windows."

This reaction is shown in FIG. 1A.",
                        "The heterorotaxane dye compounds are characterized in that they undergo aggregation in aqueous solution, the extent of which depends on their concentration in the solution, the temperature of the solution and their chemical environment. Therefore, because the fluorescence emission spectra for the dye solutions, and for inks printed from the solutions, is dependent on the extent of dye aggregation, the fluorescence emission spectra can be altered by manipulating the equilibrium between the monomeric and aggregated states of the heterorotaxane dyes. This is illustrated schematically in FIG. 1B. In the present ink compositions, this equilibrium is manipulated by the use of one or more encapsulating agents and one or more competitive binding agents in aqueous ink compositions. This is illustrated schematically in FIG. 2A.",
                        "The encapsulating agents are molecules comprising a macrocyclic ring that is capable of encapsulating one or both of the fluorophoric end groups on the substantially linear molecule of the heterorotaxane. As such, the presence of the encapsulating agents promotes the monomeric state of the fluorescent dyes. The encapsulating agents can be fluorophoric molecules or non-fluorophoric molecules. The macrocyclic ring may be, for example, the same type of macrocyclic ring that encircles the central fluorophoric group of the heterorotaxane. By way of illustration, if the central fluorophoric group of the heterorotaxane is encircled by a cyclodextrin (CD) ring, the encapsulating agent may be \u03b3-CD. Although it is not necessary to include an encapsulating agent in the ink compositions, their inclusion makes it possible to formulate ink compositions having a wide range of fluorescent colors for printing polychromic images. This wide color range can be achieved by including the encapsulating agents even if the ink compositions all comprise the same fluorescent dye molecules.",
                        "The competitive binding agents are molecules that compete with the fluorophoric end groups for binding to the encapsulating agents. As such, the inclusion of the competitive binding agents in the ink compositions promotes the aggregated state of the fluorescent dyes. The competitive binding agents can be fluorophoric molecules or non-fluorophoric molecules. In some embodiment of the ink compositions, the competitive binding agents comprise the same fluorophoric groups as the heterorotaxane. By way of illustration, if the encapsulating agent comprises a CD ring, the competitive binding agent may be 2-adamantylamine hydrochloride. However, many other competitive binding agents can be used. The competitive binding agents need not be included in the ink compositions. However, when they are present in combination with one or more encapsulating agents, they enable the ink compositions to access an even wider range of fluorescent colors.",
                        "The fluorescence intensity of the ink compositions and inks at a given wavelength will be determined by the sum of the fluorescence emission intensities of each component in the ink composition or printed ink. Thus, at a given wavelength, the fluorescence intensity of the ink compositions and printed inks printed from the compositions will depend on the relative concentrations of the components of the ink compositions and will also depend on the association strength between the encapsulating agents and the competitive binding agents. Moreover, because the sensitivity of the fluorescence emission spectra to the concentrations of the components and their equilibrium constants is non-linear, the complex supramolecular equilibria in the aqueous ink compositions give rise to a powerful chemical encryption printing system characterized by a complex and highly varied printed color palette. As a result, multicolored fluorescent images can be produced by applying different ink compositions to the surface of a substrate and allowing the inks to dry, providing a polychromatic film of ink on the surface. The different ink compositions may differ in the relative amounts of heterorotaxane, encapsulating agent and binding agent present in solution, differ in the competitive binding agents present in solution, or differ in both respects.",
                        "The multicolored fluorescent images can be printed using an automated printing device, such as an inkjet printer, comprising a plurality of ink channels containing the different ink compositions. However, the ink composition can also be dispensed from handheld writing utensils, such as ink pens. When the ink compositions dry they form an image that appears multicolored when viewed under an ultraviolet light.",
                        "The presence of the inks in a printed image can be verified by simply viewing the image under an appropriate light source, such as a UV light source and observing the resulting fluorescence emission from the image. Further confirmation of the presence of the inks can be verified using chemical indicators. Indicators that the inks are present in a printed image include: the observation of a non-linear color change when the printed image is exposed to aqueous solutions containing different competitive binding agents; the observation of a change in the color gradient of the image or the observation of new colors in the image when a composition comprising a competitive binding agent and/or an encapsulating agent is printed over the printed image; the observation of a characteristic color change when the printed image is exposed to a fluorescence quencher; and/or the observation of a characteristic color change when the printed image is submerged in water or an aqueous solution.",
                        "Similarly, the authenticity of a printed image comprising the fluorescent inks can be verified by applying an authentication reagent over the image, wherein the authentication reagent induces a change in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image; and comparing the change in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image against a known fluorescence emission spectrum change for an authentic printed image. That is, the change in the emission spectrum can be compared against a known standard. The printed image being authenticated may be polychromic image. The comparison may be carried out by simply comparing a visual observation of the change in the fluorescence emission with an expected change in the fluorescence emission. Alternatively, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image can be obtained under UV illumination before and after the application of the authentication reagent to obtain the change in the emission spectrum for the printed image. That change can then be compared with the change in the fluorescence emission spectrum for an authentic printed image, using the same authentication reagent, to see if they match.",
                        "Various embodiments of the authentication reagents operate as follows. In some embodiments the authentication reagents comprise water-soluble non-fluorescent encapsulating agents and/or non-fluorescent competitive binding agents that alter the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image. In other embodiments, the authentication reagents comprise water-soluble fluorescent dyes as competitive binding that alter the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image. In still other embodiments, the authentication reagents comprise salts that provide anions that undergo anion exchange with the anions associated with the heterorotaxane in the fluorescent inks to alter the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image. In yet other embodiments, the authentication reagent comprises water, which washes away water-soluble encapsulation agents and/or water soluble competitive binding agents in the fluorescent inks to alter the fluorescence emission spectrum of the image.",
                        "The use of the fluorescent dyes to print and authenticate a polychromic image is illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 4C. Initially an ink composition color palette can be generated from a plurality of ink compositions characterized by different fluorescent emission spectra, depending upon the particular formulation of each ink composition. A number of the ink compositions from the color palette can then be selected for printing. Information about the nature and concentration of the components in each of the selected ink compositions is supramolecularly encrypted into characteristic fluorescent emission spectra that depend, in a non-linear fashion, on the concentration of fluorescent dye present in the ink composition and also on the nature and concentration of encapsulating agents and competitive binding agents in the ink composition. The selected ink compositions are then printed onto a substrate to form a polychromic image comprising the fluorescent dyes, thereby encrypting the fluorescence emission spectra information in the printed image. Finally, the authenticity of the printed image can be verified using a chemical authentication agent, as described above."

The efficient (83%) and rapid (\u02dc3 h) production (16) of R4.4Cl in water is facilitated (17, 18) by cooperative capture. It was initially envisioned that the CB6 and \u03b3-CD rings in this heterorotaxane could prevent aggregation-induced quenching of the DAPP fluorophore, which exhibits (19) a high fluorescence quantum yield in solution (\u03a6=53%) but not in the solid state (\u03a6\u22480).",

Despite the presence of the CB6 (20) and \u03b3-CD rings (21), R4.4Cl is driven by intermolecular hydrophobic and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions to form aggregates (R4+agg) in water. A blue shift (7 nm) of the absorption band near 450 nm was recorded (FIG. 1D) in the concentration-dependent UV/Vis absorption spectrum of R4.4Cl upon dilution from 500 to 25 \u03bcM, while the shoulder around 350 nm, arising from the pyrene stopper, diminished. Assuming that aggregation is homogenous and non-cooperative (22), the aggregation constant Kagg (23) was determined to be 1.6\u00d7104 M\u22121. Irradiating the monomeric R4.4Cl (5 \u03bcM) at 340 and 443 nm resulted in identical fluorescence emission spectra with an emission maximum (\u03a6=52.4%) at 510 nm. No emission was observed at 390 nm, indicating (FIG. 1C) the transfer of the excited state energy from pyrene to DAPP by a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism (24) with near-quantitative (>99%) efficiency.",
                                "As R4.4Cl undergoes increased aggregation at higher and higher concentrations, its narrow emission band (FIG. 1E) at 510 nm was gradually replaced by a broad, featureless band around 610 nm, implying that either excimers (DAPP homodimers) or exciplexes (pyrenyl-DAPP heterodimers) are being formed in the excited state. Circular dichroism spectra reveal (FIG. 1F) that the aggregation of R4.4Cl (200 \u03bcM) is temperature dependent. As the temperature was lowered from 80\u00b0 C. (monomeric state) to 2\u00b0 C. (aggregated state), the positive induced circular dichroism (ICD) signals diminished as a negative ICD peak, attributable to the pyrene stoppers, appeared at around 350 nm, indicating (25, 26) that these stoppers congregate near the rims of the \u03b3-CD ring. Since \u03b3-CD encircles DAPP, it follows that pyrene-DAPP heterodimers (FIG. 1B), and their corresponding exciplexes, are responsible for the observed aggregation and emission behavior of R4.4Cl.",

Encapsulation of the pyrene stoppers by \u03b3-CD promotes the disassembly of R4+2 in favor of a monomeric R4+\u2282\u03b3-CD2 complex, formed from a R4+\u2282\u03b3-CD intermediate, with an equilibrium constant KCD\u2550K1.K2.

We found that the R4+ \u2282CD2 ink exhibits an unusual phenomenon\u2014the color of its emission depends (FIG. 3A) on the type of paper used as a result of varying noncovalent interactions with papers of different compositions. Under UV light, R4.4Cl appears reddish-orange and R4+ \u2282CD2 appears green on rag paper, newsprint, and banknotes, consistent with the corresponding powders, whereas, on various types of ordinary white paper (FIG. 3A and Table 1), both of these inks appear reddish-orange. A monochromic QR code (FIG. 3B) printed on paper from an inkjet cartridge contains information that, although invisible under natural light, can be read on a smartphone under UV light. By loading aqueous solutions of R4+ \u2282CD2 (R4+: \u03b3-CD=1:50), \u03b3-CD, and Ad.Cl into a tri-color inkjet cartridge (FIG. 3C), polychromic fluorescence printing is possible, provided that the rates of supramolecular encapsulation are faster than the rates of printing and drying. A fluorescent reproduction of van Gogh's \u2018Sunflowers\u2019 and its digital replica (FIG. 3D and FIG. 3E, respectively) demonstrate the feasibility of printing broad-spectrum polychromic images with good color resolution. It is worth noting that R4+ is well-placed for assimilation into a commercial setting on account of its simple and high-yielding synthesis from commodity chemicals. A fluorescent replica of Briex's \u2018Apostelhoeve Wine Estate Maastricht\u2019 printed using an inkjet cartridge with the same setting as in FIG. 3K under UV and natural light and its digital replica are shown in FIGS. 3L and 3M, repectively.",
                                "At a fundamental level, the nonlinear nature of this system's sensitivity to concentrations of components and their equilibrium constants (Eq. 3) points towards a general concept whereby complex supramolecular equilibria in aqueous solution can be used as a chemical encryption method. Even with access to all of the ink components, it would be challenging for counterfeiters to reproduce a printed color palette without having a complete knowledge of the inks' initial concentrations and channel assignments in the print cartridge. In an attempt to demonstrate the non-linear nature of this system, we have printed fluorescent color palettes (FIGS. 3G-3J) using various ink concentrations and different CAs. (A standard color palette is shown in FIG. 3F.) A broad range of colors from green to red were printed (FIG. 3G) when Ad.Cl was used as the competitor. The color palette was also sensitive to the association strength of the competitor, noting the differences between images printed from equally concentrated solutions of Ad.Cl (FIG. 3G) and a stronger-binding competitor (FIG. 3H), namely, 1-adamantanemethylamine hydrochloride (AdMe.Cl, KAdMe=127 M\u22121). Reducing the concentrations of either CA (FIGS. 3H and 3I) or \u03b3-CD (FIGS. 3H and 3J) contracts the color spectrum in the greenish-yellow region or yellowish-red region, respectively. The color range of the fluorescent inks can be expanded to accommodate RGB printing (FIG. 3K) by choosing a fluorescent CA, such as a fragment of the R4.4Cl, 1-pyrenemethylamine hydrochloride (PyMe.Cl), with blue emission. The ability to exchange fluorescent and non-fluorescent CAs in a modular and user-controlled manner elevates the anti-counterfeiting features possessed intrinsically by this security ink.",
                                "The dynamic nature of the inks makes them amenable to a variety (FIG. 4) of fraud detection tests. Exposure of a printed image (FIG. 4A) to aqueous solutions of different CAs results (Eq. 3) in nonlinear color changes. Printing non-fluorescent AdMe.Cl or CD on top of an existing document changes the existing color gradient of the image, while printing fluorescent PyMe.Cl or 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium (PTSA.4Na) creates new colors such as blue and purple by shifting the complex equilibria or extent of counterion exchange. A characteristic color change can also be brought about through the application of a quencher, such as tryptophan, or even by simply soaking the printed image in water for as little as 1-2 mins, during which time \u03b3-CD and the CA will be washed away. Not only can these authentication agents discriminate between images produced by the R4+-based ink and other dyes, but they can also distinguish those produced using different ink formulations containing R4+. Blocks of a given fluorescence color (FIG. 4B, lanes 1b-c and 2b-c), which appear almost identical to one another under UV light, but are formulated differently, were found to result in noticeably different colors (FIGS. 4B, lanes 1a, 1d, 2a, and 2d) after the application of the same amount of an authentication agent. Since hundreds of chemicals meet the criteria to be competing agents, in principle we can generate an infinite library of different ink systems and authentication tests using this supramolecular encryption method. A flow chart of the authentication process is shown in FIG. 4C.",

The solid-state emission of these security inks can be fine-tuned over a wide emission range with rapid response to chemical stimuli. The printed information is encrypted in a chemical language based on a nonlinear equation that describes a dynamic network, which can generate a potentially infinite library of different fluorescent color palettes. In contrast with conventional dyes, the encrypted information printed with the heterorotaxane inks can be verified using chemical authentication without revealing the original color image information.",

Typically, 0.5 mL of the ink was loaded into a fountain pen for writing tests. A wide selection of paper-based printing media were tested, including copy papers (variety brands and models), matte presentation paper (HP), glossy presentation paper (HP), resume papers (25 and 100% cotton), newsprint papers, rag paper (100% cotton, without optical brightener), cardboard, and cigarette rolling paper.

Optical brightener can interfere with the ink performance by reducing the contrast level.
