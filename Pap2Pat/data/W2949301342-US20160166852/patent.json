The visible light can be used to trigger changes in proteins that modulate membrane potentials in neuronal cells through excitatory or inhibitory membrane currents. This ability to modulate neuronal cells has proven instrumental in preclinical studies and holds enormous potential for the treatment of diseases such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, and depression. However, current techniques used for optogenetic control are too invasive for clinical applications. That is, although optogenetics allows researchers to study parts of the brain like never before, it is limited because it is invasive, and visible light cannot travel very deeply into tissue."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The subject invention provides novel and advantageous methods and systems for performing optogenetics using X-rays and/or ultrasound waves. Light-emitting particles can be provided to a target area (e.g., a brain of an animal such as a human or other mammal) and then stimulated by X-rays or ultrasound waves.

The light-emitting particles can be, for example, light-emitting nanophosphors (NPs) (e.g., visible-light-emitting nanophospors) or chemiluminescent agents (e.g., fluoresceinyl Cypridina luminescent analog).",
                        "Optogenetics can use rhodopsins, such as channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), to induce excitatory potentials in transfected neurons of animals. ChR2 is a transmembrane ion channel found in green algae that becomes permeable to cations in the presence of blue light. ChR2 can be used in neurons because ion channels are a main contributor in electrical signal transduction in the brain. Optogenetics allows researchers to target specific areas of the brain and study how modulated neuron firing affects downstream behaviors and cellular processes. Also, other light-sensitive transmembrane proteins that regulate the transmembrane voltage by maintaining ion concentrations on either side of the membrane can be used in the field of optogenetics. Halorhodpsin (NphR) and archeorhodopsin (Arch) are two such proteins and can be referred to as ion pumps. Both channels and pumps can be further generalized into the protein group called rhodopsins.",
                        "A typical optogenetics technique can include transfecting specified neuronal cells with DNA encoding for the appropriate rhodopsin for the application. Upon expression of these proteins, a light fiber can be surgically implanted into the organism's brain so light at the stimulating wavelengths can directly irradiate neurons and modulate their membrane current. Such current modulation comes in two forms that depend on the ions to which the channel becomes permeable in its open state. The cation-specific channels lead to membrane depolarization (excitatory), and the proton/anion-specific pumps cause the membrane to hyperpolarize (inhibitory). In this way, the membrane current can be directly controlled by a light source, which in related art applications is in the form of either a laser or a light-emitting diode (LED). Both sources have limitations. Lasers are very costly, while the light from an LED is spread out and not a focused beam, so it cannot be accurately targeted as a laser can.",
                        "Current practice of optogenetics is performed on a macroscopic scale. For example, ChR2-expressing cells have been activated by a 470-490 nm light in a power range of 1-20 mW/mm2 with pulse duration of 5-100 ms. This type of stimulation results in a ChR2-channel driven membrane current that peaks around \u22129 pA/pF. In these instances, the studied tissue is flooded with light and any cell within a few millimeters of the source that is expressing rhodopsins will have modulated membrane currents that may lead to distinct network and/or behavioral changes. X-ray optogenetic and ultrasound optogenetic techniques of the subject invention can shift the scale from the macroscopic to a microscopic or even nanoscopic level of control.",
                        "Because of the invasive nature or limited penetration of LEDs and laser sources, infrared radiation has been used with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). After excitation, these nanoparticles emit photons of visible light whose wavelengths can be customized based on the particle chemistry. These emissions can then be used to modulate the membrane current. This method is less invasive than those that use LEDs or lasers. Despite this incremental improvement to the optogenetic approach, infrared (IR) light has its limitations as well. IR penetration through the skull is about 4-10% of the initial intensity, and IR light at 868 nm only penetrates brain tissue enough to gain access to a fraction of human cortical neurons, as the human cortex thickness is typically in the range of 2-5.5 mm.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of an X-ray optogenetic system 10 according to an embodiment of the subject invention. Referring to FIG. 1, an X-ray source 20 can provide X-rays, which can be focused through an optional focusing element 25. Light-emitting particles 30 can be provided to a focus area (e.g., a mammal brain 40), and can emit light (e.g., visible light) upon stimulation by the X-rays. Light-sensitive ion channels 45 within the focus area can receive light as a stimulus and open to allow for ion flow, thereby changing the membrane potential and possibly stimulating an action potential. The light-emitting particles 30 can be nanophosphors (NPs), such as visible-light-emitting NPs, though embodiments are not limited thereto. The optional focusing element 25 can be, for example, a lens such as a poly-capillary lens. In an embodiment, the X-ray source 20 can include a carbon nanotube cathode emitting electrons that are focused onto an anode through a gate and/or focusing electrode. An optional X-ray stop (or detector) 27 can also be present to collect any unabsorbed X-ray radiation.",
                        "The light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open, for example, at least 30% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus. In one embodiment, the light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open about 30%-70% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus. In an alternative embodiment, the light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open at least 70% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus.",
                        "FIG. 2 shows a schematic view of an ultrasonic optogenetic system 50 according to an embodiment of the subject invention. Referring to FIG. 2, an ultrasound source 60 can provide ultrasound waves 65 to the target (e.g., a mammal brain 40). Light-emitting particles 35 can be provided to the target and can emit light (e.g., visible light) upon stimulation caused by the ultrasound waves 65. The waves 65 can cause vibrations that induce pressure fluctuations 70, and these can cause the light-emitting particles 35 to emit light. Light-sensitive ion channels 45 within the focus area can receive light as a stimulus and open to allow for ion flow, thereby changing the membrane potential and possibly stimulating an action potential. The ultrasound source 60 can deliver vibrations of a frequency that is, for example, on the order of kHz or MHz. In the case of the target being a human brain, the vibrations can penetrate through the skull 45 up to a depth of, for example, 3 cm (or even more).",
                        "The light-emitting particles 35 can be chemiluminescent agents, such as fluoresceinyl Cypridina luminescent analog (FCLA), which reacts with oxygen free radicals in air bubbles to emit light, though embodiments are not limited thereto. Such a chemiluminescent agent can emit light by interacting with reactive oxygen species that result from the ultrasonic waves 65 passing through tissue; the interaction can cause a release of chemical energy that alters the structure of the chemiluminescent agent into a brief excited state, with the subsequent relaxation resulting in emission of one or more photons.",
                        "The light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open, for example, at least 30% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus. In one embodiment, the light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open about 30%-70% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus. In an alternative embodiment, the light-sensitive ion channels 45 can open at least 70% of the time after receiving a single photon as a stimulus.",
                        "In X-ray optogenetic systems and methods of the subject invention, X-rays can be provided to a target sample and converted to visible light. In many embodiments, X-ray-excitable light-emitting particles are used (e.g., through delivery to the target sample). Such light-emitting particles can be, for example, light-emitting NPs (e.g., visible-light-emitting NPs). Specific nanophosphors can absorb X-ray light, thereby promoting a number of resident electrons to higher energy orbitals. These electrons then quickly revert back to their ground-state, emitting light with energy equal to the band gap between the two orbitals in the process. If these nanophosphors are targeted to the rhodopsins inserted into the brain, then the emitted visible light can be close enough to change the properties of the rhodopsins to perform optogenetics. The use of nanophosphors is not required in traditional optogenetics, but it is a beneficial tool that allows optogenetics to be performed deeper into tissue.",
                        "The light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) can be biocompatible and emit light at wavelengths that properly activate the light-sensitive ion channels/pumps. Many nanophosphors can be readily produced with tunable emission, absorbance, and solubility properties. Table 1 lists nanophosphors with emission maxima in the visible domain. With regards to their excitation spectra, two distinct types of nanoparticles can be seen: up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and UV/X-ray excitable nanoparticles. UCNPs emit visible photons during exposure to long wavelength infrared radiation, while the UV/X-ray excitable particles emit visible photons during exposure to short wavelength UV/X-ray radiation. Particles in the same conversion can be doped with similar ions, though this is not necessary. For example, UCNPs can contain Yb3+, Ln3+, or Er, while particles sensitive to the shorter wavelength radiation can contain Cr3+, Eu3+, or Tb3+. In Table 1, PEG is polyethylene glycol, PAA is poly(acrylic acid), PGA is polyglycolic acid, PEI is polyethylenimine, and DSPE-PEG-COOH is 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine[carboxy(polyethyleneglycol)].",
                        "Of the NPs in Table 1, most have the excitation wavelength in the range from 147-980 nm. Five NPs have an excitation wavelength of 980 nm, all of which are UCNPs. X-rays have a wavelength range from 0.01-10 nm and therefore cannot efficiently excite these NPs. However, the particles with the base chemistry of Gd2O2S and LiGa5O8 absorb light in both the UV and X-ray ranges. Additionally, these particles can be doped with Cr3+, Eu3+, or Tb3+. Other particles can also utilize these dopants and can be useful for X-ray excitation.",
                        "Certain NPs can be improved for use in X-ray optogenetics (X-optogenetics), especially in the areas of solubility, conversion efficiency, emission, size, and targeting. For example, Table 1 includes NPs that emit light across the visible light spectrum and into the NIR range, with the shortest wavelength emitted at 450 nm and the longest at 800 nm. The emission wavelength is a result of the chemical formula of the NP and the compound with which it is doped. For example, NaYF4 doped with Eu3+ has an emission wavelength of 592 nm while NaYF4 doped with Tb3+ has an emission wavelength of 545 nm. The ability to alter a nanophosphor's emission wavelength by changing the chemical formula or the compound with which it is doped can be beneficial in optimizing NPs for X-optogenetics. Hybrid doping schemes may also allow for more tailored emission spectra.",
                        "The conversion efficiency is the ability for the NPs to convert X-ray energy to visible light energy. This is not listed for many of the NPs in Table 1, but it can be an important consideration for X-optogenetic applications. When choosing an NP for X-optogenetics, the conversion efficiency should be as high as possible to reduce the amount of time and X-ray dose to which the subject is exposed. Of course, X-ray stimulation on humans is feasible and safe.",
                        "When considering X-optogenetics for neuronal intervention (e.g., use on an animal brain, such as a human brain), the size distribution and coating of the NPs are important for penetration of the phosphors across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to gain access to the cells in the brain. Sizes of particles targeted outside of the central nervous system do not need to be as small, but should still be optimized for maximum bioavailability. Polysorbate-coated nanoparticles can provide high (possibly maximum) passage through the BBB (e.g., for nanoparticles under 100 nm in diameter). Given the sizes of the NPs listed in Table 1 (between 10 nm and 1 \u03bcm) and recent advances in nanotechnology, NPs can be obtained with an appropriate size distribution for a range of X-optogenetic applications.",
                        "In addition to size, the ability for the particles to be soluble or colloidal in water is a critical property of the NPs as this should add to their biocompatibility. A number of surface coatings, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) and other forms of hydrophilic polymers, can be used to solubilize or suspend the particles in aqueous solutions. These types of coatings can be used for the NPs to facilitate X-optogenetics. These coatings can also have a profound effect (e.g., a positive effect) on the ability of the particles to cross the BBB.",
                        "In X-optogenetic systems and methods of the subject invention, the placement of the light sources that will be used to generate membrane current in the target neurons can be an important consideration. The proximity of the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) in relation to the rhodopsins should be within very short distances as power density is reduced by >90% after 1 mm for all wavelengths of visible light. One way of inhibiting or preventing this light loss through tissue is to directly target the light-sensitive ion channels/pumps through functionalization of the light-emitting particles (e.g., nanoparticles such as NPs). Small peptide sequences or antibodies can be conjugated and used to enhance cellular uptake or adhesion to the cellular membrane (Gupta et al., Biomaterials 26(18), 3995-4021, Elsevier (2005); De la Fuente et al., Langmuir 22(7), 3286-3293, ACS Publications (2006); and Zhou et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 2006, 82, 1058; all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). Using similar methods, the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) can be functionalized to specifically bind to the rhodopsins expressed by the target neurons. For example, monoclonal antibodies showing specificity toward ChR2 antigens can be produced by a number of proprietary companies. These antibodies can then be conjugated to the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) by reacting their free amine group with the carboxylic acid coating of the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs). In this way, the proximity issue between the light-sensitive ion channels and the light sources can be minimized, and the light loss due to tissue absorption mitigated.",
                        "Table 2 shows an overview for multiple light-sensitive ion channels/pumps. Included are approximate sizes of the channels/pumps that help validate close proximity of NPs and channels/pumps after targeting. NPs that can be used for targeting the ion channels/pumps are also specified.",
                        "In many embodiments, the genetically-modified target neurons can be specifically targeted through functionalization of the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs), and this can provide a first level of control for neuron activation. In a further embodiment, a second level of control can come from the ability to focus X-rays through the use of a focusing element. The focusing element can be, for example, a lens (e.g., a poly-capillary lens), a zone plate, or a similar focusing means such as a grating. In addition to enhanced control over the neuronal activation, focused X-rays can result in less bulk X-ray dose to the patient, which is always of high concern when dealing with ionizing radiation.",
                        "A poly-capillary lens focuses X-rays in the form of an intense microspot using an array of glass micro-capillaries. The size of the focal spot can be, for example, as low as 5 \u03bcm. However, for single neuron targeting, focal spots of a few 100 \u03bcm can be more applicable. Conventional poly-capillary lenses have a working energy range of 0.5-30 keV. These can be described as soft X-rays and more easily absorbed by the brain tissues. Also, poly-capillary optics can focus higher energy X-rays up to 60 keV, although transmission through these lenses can be low (e.g., <5%) at energies higher than 5 keV.",
                        "Excitation of X-ray excitable nanophosphors is described in Cong et al. (X-Ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography With Polycapillary Focusing, Access, IEEE (2014)), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. X-ray intensity distribution in biological soft tissues can be approximated with inverse distance weighting. In this approximation,",
                        "I(r)=I0W(r,r0)\u2225r\u2212r0|\u22252,\u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "where r0 is the vertex of the double cones, I0 is the intensity of the X-ray source, and W(r,r0) is the aperture function of the double cones at the vertex r0. For accurate membrane current modulation of the target neurons, the initial intensity of the X-ray source can be adjusted so that the nanophosphors near r0 will receive enough X-ray energy to emit a sufficient number of light photons to activate the rhodopsins. This real-time adjustment also depends on the location of the target neurons as well as the size and fluorescence conversion efficiency of the nanoparticles.",
                        "In an embodiment, a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) can be used for more precise focusing of X-rays. FZPs can be micro-fabricated from a soft metal (e.g., gold or nickel), and can modulate either amplitude or phase-shift of incoming X-rays. These modulations can result in a wave diffraction and constructive interference at a focal point. One consideration is that zone plates are typically used for synchrotron produced X-rays. Similar to the poly-capillary lens, zone plates are most effective for X-rays with lower energy levels (e.g., 5-8 keV).",
                        "In certain embodiments, light can be delivered in pulses. Such pulses can be, for example, from 5-100 ms each in duration, though embodiments are not limited thereto. With light emitted from the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) as they are excited by X-rays, the pulsation comes from the X-ray source itself. Conventional tubes emit X-rays under 10-500 mA current and require several minutes for warming up before emission. Achieving a pulsing emission rate if 5-100 ms/pulse can be difficult or impossible with such a source. A carbon-nanotube field-emission cathode can produce soft X-rays and can be capable of pulsing at high rates for X-optogenetics.",
                        "Systems and methods of the subject invention also include those intended for ultrasound optogenetics (U-optogenetics). Sonoluminescence was first discovered in 1934 when air bubbles in a photo-developing solution were seen to emit short bursts of light when subjected to ultrasonic waves. This sonoluminescence effect is due to a cavitation process in which bubbles fill with gas and vapor. Under ultrasonic waves of a specific pressure, collisions between free electrons and ions in the air bubbles cause them to collapse, and these collisions result in thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from electron deflections, which is released as a short burst of light.",
                        "Ultrasonic stimulation provides a non-invasive way to stimulate light emission with greater depth than traditional optogenetics. U-optogenetics also has an advantage over X-optogenetics by not delivering ionizing radiation, but it does not equal the penetration distance and focusing power of X-ray techniques.",
                        "In certain embodiments of the subject invention, the sonoluminescence effect can be enhanced by the introduction of a chemiluminescent agent. For example, such a chemiluminescent agent can be fluoresceinyl Cypridina luminescent analog (FCLA), which reacts with oxygen free radicals in air bubbles to emit luminescence. Chemiluminescent agents such as FCLA achieve their effect by interacting with reactive oxygen species that result from ultrasonic waves passing through tissue, and this interaction causes a release of chemical energy that alters the structure of the agent. Structural changes induce molecules of the agent into a brief excited state, and the subsequent relaxation results in an emission of photons. For example, under ultrasonic waves with a pressure of 200 kPa, FCLA molecules dissolved in water emit strong chemiluminescence at a peak wavelength of 532 nm with an intensity of 12,580 photons/(cm2-s). This characteristic presents an ideal emission wavelength for use in U-optogenetics.",
                        "The chemiluminescent agent (e.g., FCLA) can be targeted close to rhodopsins using a method similar to that discussed herein for X-ray excitable light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs). When subjected to ultrasonic waves, the collapsing air bubbles interacting with the chemiluminescent agent (e.g., FCLA) emit bursts of light to trigger the activation of select rhodopsins.",
                        "FIG. 2 illustrates the use of sonoluminescence to stimulate the ion channels. Under these conditions, sonoluminescence provides an alternative excitation pathway in optogenetics. The advantage of ultrasound over X-ray methods is that no radiation dose would be introduced to the patient. However, there is greater attenuation of ultrasonic waves in tissue and bone as compared to X-rays, so penetration depth would be limited. By using low frequency ultrasound waves, penetration depth can be maximized. For ultrasound waves with a frequency of 1 MHz, the penetration depth in bone is approximately 0.3 cm; at a wave frequency of 100 kHz, the penetration depth would increase to approximately 3 cm. Penetration depths of greater than 3 cm through the skull can even be achieved with ultrasound by use of acoustic complementary metamaterials that can cancel out aberrating layers in bone, which could be relevant to scaffold-based experiments.",
                        "The U-optogenetic methods and systems can be most effective when the chemiluminescent agent (e.g., FCLA) is most effective at targeting ion channels and pumps directly. Methods similar to those discussed herein for NP targeting can be used to this end.",
                        "X-optogenetics and U-optogentics provide several advantages over existing optogenetic approaches. Both are far less invasive and allow for good penetration depth. X-optogenetics in particular allows for penetration to any point in a sample and also for a high level of focus. U-optogenetics provides no radiation dose but cannot penetrate as deeply or focus as sharply as X-optogenetics.",
                        "Through functionalization of light-emitting particles, a desirable targeting capability can be achieved that allows for accumulation of the light-emitting particles near the rhodopsins. When choosing the light-emitting particles for X-optogenetics, those with high energy conversion efficiency are preferred as they work with lower X-ray dose, given the maximum power emission for cell stimulation. Further, the size distribution of light-emitting particles can also affect the dose needed to achieve sufficient visible light emission. A Focusing element (e.g., a poly-capillary lens or zone plate) can be used to focus X-rays onto altered cells. The X-ray flux can directly affect the density of the emitted light. Through the use of a carbon nanotube X-ray source rather than a conventional source, a high level of temporal control can be implemented over X-ray excitation, inducing luminescence pulses from the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) at suitable frequencies and duty cycles.",
                        "The closer the light-emitting particles (e.g., NPs) are to the rhodopsins, the more photons there will be that are able to activate them. Therefore, the light-emitting particles can be targeted to the rhodopsins as specifically as possible. It is possible that only a small number of the proteins will be directly targeted by the light-emitting particles relative to the number expressed in a given cell.",
                        "In many optogenetic applications, light stimuli are delivered in sub-second pulse trains over relatively longer periods. In certain embodiments, a CNT X-ray source can be used and can provide millisecond control over the X-ray delivery. While multiple pulses will increase the total effective radiation dose, a single X-ray dose resulting in a single light stimulus can cause lasting membrane voltage modulation in the target neurons. Thus, radiation dose can be minimized if needed. That is, in certain embodiments, a single pulse of X-ray radiation can be provided for stimulation of the light-emitting particles.",
                        "As with X-optogenetics, U-optogenetics via sonoluminescence can stimulate ion channels without the need for implanted light sources. Sonoluminescence can be enhanced by a chemiluminescent agent (e.g., FCLA), which can emit bursts of light from air bubbles collapsing under ultrasonic pulses. Targeting of a chemiluminescent agent to ion channels can provide a means for direct stimulation. Also there is no issue with pulse-train application in U-optogenetics because radiation dose is not an issue for this technique.",
                        "Without the use of a light probe, X-optogenetics and U-optogenetics are much less invasive and more applicable for research and other applications than related art optogenetic techniques. The decreased invasiveness makes use of optogenetics on humans and/or for applications to features deeper into tissue more feasible. Additionally, the optogenetic techniques of the subject invention are less time-consuming and more ethical than related art techniques because researchers no longer need to surgically drill into the skull of the subject. Moreover, X-optogenetics and U-optogenetics allow for study of parts of the brain that related art optogenetic techniques do not.",

                        "With the involved ionizing radiation for X-optogenetics, it is important to quantify the delivered radiation dose during a procedure. Everyone is generally subject to a baseline effective radiation dose of about 3 mSv a year, but increased levels of radiation exposure occur as a result of X-ray radiography, CT, and PET/SPECT imaging exposure. The effective dose from such a scan can range anywhere from 0.001 mSv-25 mSv. These values depend on the region of exposure, type of radiation, and type of scan. For X-ray related scans, a highest effective dose administered is around 10 mSv. This number was used as the highest effective dose permissible in the following analysis.",
                        "Table 2 summarizes the requirements for various rhodopsins. While related art techniques take only a macroscopic view of optogenetics, X-optogenetics can use a micro/nanoscopic scale as well. NPs that are excitable with X-rays can be used, and such NPs should be biocompatible and have a high conversion efficiency. Depending on the NPs used, the X-ray dose can be adjusted. In any case, the NPs should emit visible light that can be used for optogenetics. A CNT, poly-capillary lens, FZP or a similar component can be used to deliver X-rays.",
                        "Assuming a maximum effective radiation dose of 10 mSv, a theoretical calculation of power emitted from the nanophosphors chosen from Table 2 was performed. For X-ray radiation, a Sievert (Sv) is defined as 1 Joule (J) of energy per kilogram (kg) of tissue. By definition, 1 J is equal to 6.24\u00d71012 MeV. Furthermore, the conversion efficiency of Gd2O2S particles is about 60,000 visible photons per MeV of absorbed X-ray energy. Using these relationships, the following conversion can be performed",

                        "This conversion is the approximation of photons absorbed per microgram of brain tissue. Then, the number of photons per NP can be approximated. According to the manufacturer, there are about 3.25\u00d71013 nanophosphors per gram or 3.25\u00d7107 per microgram. Using these assumptions, another conversion can be performed.",

                        "Less than one photon per NP is not enough to activate a single rhodopsin. However, two of the initial assumptions can be altered to greatly enhance the number of photons per nanophosphor. The first is the phosphor diameter. The NP mass used in the equation was for 50 nm diameter NPs. Simply by increasing the NP diameter by a factor of 3 (to 150 nm), the NP mass can be increased by 27 times (33), assuming the material density is constant. Increasing the mass results in a proportional decrease of the number of NPs per microgram, yet the conversion efficiency and input energy remain constant. Therefore, output emission is boosted to 3 photons per NP. Further improvement can be achieved by increasing the conversion efficiency of the NPs. The current conversion factor (60,000 photons/MeV) is only 15% as there is enough energy to generate \u02dc400,000 visible photons (496 nm) in one MeV. Therefore, every 5% increase in efficiency is equal to an increase of 20,000 photons. With both of these adjustments, phosphors with a diameter of 150 nm and a quantum efficiency of 50% will emit more than 10 photons per nanophosphor under the acceptable X-ray dose.",
                        "In addition, the number of light photons needed to open the light-activated ion channel/pumps was analyzed. To approximate this number, an understanding of the gating mechanism in the proteins is necessary. The light-sensitive moiety of all rhodopsins is a covalently bound derivative of Vitamin A, retinal, that isomerizes under light excitation. The sensitivity of rhodopsins can be defined in part by the quantum efficiency of retinal. This is described as the likelihood of the chromophore to isomerize after absorption of a single photon of light. This efficiency can fall between 30% and 70% in rhodopsins. With this in mind, a single rhodopsin needs between 1.5 and 3 photons of absorbed light to isomerize the retinal molecule and trigger activation of the protein. As calculated herein, by increasing the radius of the particles alone, sufficient numbers of photons can be generated to activate the rhodopsins.",
