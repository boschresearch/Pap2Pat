                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The vaginal microbiome is a dynamic system with a complex mixture of various microorganisms in different ratios and quantities, which depends upon lactic acid producing bacteria to maintain a weakly acidic environment (typically pH 3.5 to 4.5). Any sudden change in the vaginal micro-flora will increase the vaginal pH and consequently create a more favorable environment for the establishment of vaginal pathogens, which grow optimally at pH over 5. The imbalance in the flora of microorganisms in the vagina can thus lead to vaginal infections, a condition that affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age each year.",
                        "Vaginal Candida infection is a common problem, affecting most women at times (more than 75%), but posing a larger and extremely bothersome as well as recurrent problem for a number of women (8%). Symptoms include itching, soreness or irritation, reddened and swollen vaginal tissues, pain with urination and intercourse, typically adhesive white and clumpy curd-like discharge (like cottage cheese) or normal to thin and watery discharge. Candida albicans is the most common pathogen, often present in smaller amounts normally in the vagina, mouth, digestive tract and on the skin without causing infection, but with changes in the normal flora, such as after antibiotic treatment, Candida can overgrow and infect. However, the knowledge of the occurrence of vulvovaginal infections is to a large degree incomplete due to the psychosocial stigma associated with genital infections.",
                        "The virulence of C. albicans is mediated by a transformation from planktonic cells into hyphae. The hyphal form, i.e. filamentous cells, has the ability to invade tissue and induce inflammation, mediated by candidalysin, a cytotoxic peptide toxin that destroy the epithelial cells of the vagina (Moyes et. al., Nature, 2016, 532, 64).",
                        "Candida thrives on the glycogen present in vaginal mucosa, and infection is also facilitated by the effect on the mucosa of increased estrogen levels during pregnancy, and also by the weakened immune system during gestation. Contraceptive pills can cause a similar effect, as can menstruation, as well as other stress factors. Diabetes is another common facilitator.",
                        "The diagnosis is established after a vaginal examination with swabbing of the vagina, to obtain a sample of the discharge, on which to perform microscopy of the so-called wet smear or wet mount, with an addition of KOH to lysate the epithelial cells and visualize the Candida hyphae. In women with recurrent or persistent symptoms, vaginal cultures should be obtained, as the less common species of Candida, such as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei, require different medications. Self-diagnosis may not be advisable, only 11% of women accurately diagnosed their infection in one study; and women with a previous infection were only slightly more accurate (35%) giving rise to costly treatment with potential adverse effects [D. G. Ferris, et al. Obstet. Gynecol. 2002, 99, 419-425].",
                        "Treatments include vaginal creams or tablets such as econazol, clomitrazol, miconazole, tioconazole or butoconazol for 1-3 days or 7-14 days with a persistent condition, although fluconazole is often recommended in a persistent or recurrent infection. Fluconazole can also be given weekly or every other week for 3-6 months, to prevent a recurrent infection. However, though side effects of fluconazole are mild and infrequent, they may include stomach upset, headache and rash. Fluconazole interacts with a number of medications and is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the fetus. A resistance to the drug may develop, in which case itrakonazol can be used, but also not during gestation.",
                        "Although vulvovaginal candidosis is normally not life threatening, it can be more or less chronic and reduces the quality of life, sex life, work and the ability to concentrate; it can eventually lead to depressions. A chronic condition can cause debilitating vestibulitis, which can be exceedingly difficult to treat. There is evidence supporting that excessive inflammation through prostaglandin production can cause premature contractions and preterm birth. The preterm neonate can subsequently face invasive Candida infection, one of the most serious nosocomial infections causing higher morbidity and mortality than bacterial infection, in particular in neonatal intensive care units.",
                        "There are growing concerns regarding increasing prevalence of antifungal resistance even with intravenous echincandin treatment. Treatment for women-specific diseases is a relatively underdeveloped area and vulvovaginal infections pose a large and partially hidden problem without effective treatment. Particularly at risk are diabetics and in particular pregnant diabetics. A harmless treatment for use during pregnancy could prove most valuable in prevention also of preterm birth.",
                        "Alternative suggested treatments of vulvovaginal candidosis involve use of lactic acid (cf. WO 2008/119518) and lactic acid bacteria (cf. WO 2008/071783), for long having been used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Lactic acid is however far less effective in affecting vulvovaginal candidosis.",
                        "As recognized in the art, vulvovaginal candidosis thus remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society, despite therapeutic advances [J. D. Sobel. Lancet, 2007, 369, 1961-1971].",
                        "There is thus a need for new pharmaceutical formulations against vulvovaginal candidosis. The present invention seeks to provide a simple, inexpensive, environmentally friendly solution to the problem with vulvovaginal infections."

It has been shown that such a composition reduces the presence of biofilm of different Candida species and, additionally also has a cytotoxic effect on several Candida species. Glucono \u03b4-lactone (GDA) is a solid at room temperature and at body temperature and is therefore suitable to use as the active ingredient in e.g. a vaginal tablet, disc or suppository or a vagitorium.",

A biofilm is a group of microorganisms in which cells are attached to each other. Often these cells adhere to a surface, such as a mucosal surface. The microbial cells growing in a biofilm are physiologically different from so called planktonic cells of the same organism, which are single-cells that may float or swim in a liquid medium. Candida species have the ability to form biofilms. When the biofilm formation is reduced or prevented the individual Candida cells can no longer attach to the mucosa of e.g. the vagina. Hence, the further infection is prevented and the Candida cells which no longer form a biofilm are discarded from e.g. the vagina.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "It is estimated that approximately 80% of pathogen infection in humans are related with the formation of biofilm, i.e. the formation of a complex three-dimensional structure of the pathogen bound to cell walls as well as to other pathogen cells. It has been shown that biofilm formation is required for vulvovaginal Candida infections [M. M. Harriott, E. A. Lilly, T. E. Rodriguez, P. L. Fidel, M. C. Noverr, Microbiology, 2010, 156, 3635-3644]. Further, the formation of biofilm also reduces the efficiency of anti-fungals by 10-100 times.",
                        "Given the importance of formation of biofilm in vulvovaginal Candida infections, a biofilm assay was deemed appropriate to evaluate the effect of hydroxylated carboxylic acid in targeting vulvovaginal Candida infections. In accordance with reports in the art, lactic acid was found to be moderately active in targeting vulvovaginal Candida infections in a biofilm assay (cf. the experimental part below). As biofilm formation is dependent on both pH and the occurrence of alternative carbohydrate sources, it was not surprising to learn that lactic acid provides some effect on the formation of biofilm. Further, also some other hydroxylated C2-C5 carboxylic acids provided similar effects. Their effect is deemed to be related to their acidifying effect, as the stronger acid provided somewhat stronger effects.",
                        "Surprisingly it was found that polyhydroxylated C6 carboxylic acids, e.g. gluconic acid, provided superior effects in decreasing formation of biofilm, compared to the closely related C3 and C5 analogs (i.e. glyceric acid and xylonic acid, respectively). Even more surprising, polyhydroxylated C6 carboxylic acid, e.g. gluconic acid, was found to be superior also compared to the more acidic hydroxylated carboxylic acids, such as citric acid.",
                        "Whereas the effect of other hydroxylated carboxylic acids seemingly only is due to their acidity (lowering the pH hampers the formation of biofilm), the effect of polyhydroxylated C6 carboxylic acids, e.g. gluconic acid, on formation of biofilm is pronounced already at pH<7. Thus, it seems that the effect of polyhydroxylated C6 carboxylic acid, e.g. gluconic acid, on formation of biofilm not merely is related to its acidity, but the compound itself, or more precisely the related \u03b4-lactone thereof, also provides an effect.",
                        "In the art, D-gluconic acid produced by the Pseudomonas strain AN5 has been demonstrated to have an effect on the take-all disease of wheat caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (R. Kaur et. al., Phytochemistry 67 (2006) 595-604; see also WO 00/44230 A1). The authors suggest that the ability of D-gluconic acid and other antifungal agents produced by Pseudomonas strains, e.g. phenanzine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DPG), to inhibit the take-all fungus must be, at least in part, due to their ability to lower pH in the wheat rhizosphere.",
                        "Without being bond by any theory, it may be that presence of gluconic acid favors planctonic cells over biofilm formation candida species, as polyhydroxylated C6 carboxylic acid, e.g. gluconic acid, may be used by candida species and other eucaryotes in the pentose phosphate pathway.",
                        "In water solution gluconic acid (GA, CAS 526-95-4) is in equilibrium with the glucono-\u03b4-lactone (GDA, CAS 90-8-2) and the glucono-\u03b3-lactone (GGA). Gluconic acid is difficult to produce as a solid crystalline product and is usually supplied as a 50% water solution.",
                        "Whereas such a water solution may be used to provide a liquid pharmaceutical formulation for vaginal administration, such as a vaginal cream, a vaginal gel, the water solution is less suitable for use in providing a solid pharmaceutical formulation for vaginal administration, such as a vaginal tablet, a vaginal suppository, or a vaginal ring.",
                        "To solve this problem, the inventors investigated the possibility to use glucono-\u03b4-lactone (GDA) in the preparation of solid pharmaceutical formulations. Surprisingly, the inventors found that GDA as such, i.e. the lactone itself, has an effect on the formation of biofilm of different Candida-species. Further studies revealed that the effect of GDA on biofilm formation and viability of Candida species is in comparison with the effect of gluconic acid, implicating that GDA in itself acts as an active compound.",
                        "An embodiment of the invention thus relates to pharmaceutical formulation for vaginal administration comprising a compound according to formula (III), being glucono-\u03b4-lactone (GDA).",
                        "Further the pharmaceutical formulation comprises a pharmaceutical acceptable excipient to provide a formulation. In this context \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d means an excipient that, at the dosage and concentration employed, does not cause any unwanted effects in the subjects to whom it is administered. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are well-known in the art. They may be selected from the group consisting of carriers, diluents, binders, disintegrating agents, flow-improving agents, pH-adjusting agents, stabilizing agents, viscosity adjusting agents, preservatives, gelling or swelling agents, surfactants, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, bases for suppositories, vagitories or pessaries, bases for creams, ointments, gels, lotions, shampoos, foam, sprays and the like. As recognized by the skilled person, the specific choice of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients depends on the specific form or the formulation, e.g. the dosage form. A person skilled in the art can find guidance in various textbooks, e.g. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, in providing suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Such a pharmaceutical formulation is useful in the treatment and/or prevention of vulvovaginal fungal infections.",
                        "The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be a lipophilic or hydrophilic carrier. Examples of lipophilic carriers are waxes, oils, isopropyl myristate, solid triglycerides, and cocoa butter. Examples of hydrophilic carriers are glycerol, propylene glycol, and polyoxyethylene glycol.",
                        "Further, the excipient may be a filler. Examples of fillers include saccharides, such as lactose, maltose and trehalose. Other disaccharides like e.g. sucrose, lactulose, cellobiose etc. may also be suitable for use in the present context. In a composition of the invention, a disaccharide normally contributes to a suitable structure of the composition. Saccharides may also serve as lyophilization aid.",
                        "In aqueous solution, compounds according to formula (I) are in equilibrium with corresponding lactones, e.g. \u03b4-lactone and \u03b3-lactone.",
                        "The active ingredient of the pharmaceutical formulation may thus comprise a small amount of the acid (cf. formula (I)) and/or glucono-\u03b3-lactone.",
                        "According to an embodiment, the compound according to formula (III) is partly present in the pharmaceutical formulation as an acid (formula (I)) in its non-charged protonated form, e.g. gluconic acid, and partly as the corresponding addition salt, i.e. a conjugate base, e.g. gluconate. Thus, the gluconic acid may serve to buffer the pharmaceutical formulation.
