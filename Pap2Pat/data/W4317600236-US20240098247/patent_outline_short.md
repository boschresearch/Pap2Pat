# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF INVENTION

- motivate HAS and limitations of traditional encoders

## BRIEF SUMMARY

- introduce content-adaptive encoder preset prediction
- describe method and system for content-adaptive encoder preset prediction

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce content-adaptive encoder preset prediction scheme (CAPS) for adaptive live streaming
- describe CAPS components: encoding scheme, video complexity feature extraction, and encoder preset prediction
- explain video complexity feature extraction using DCT-energy-based features
- describe encoder preset prediction using a neural network and preset selection function
- illustrate CAPS architecture and components using diagrams
- provide example training process for a network using XGBoost algorithm
- describe method for content-adaptive encoder preset prediction using video complexity feature extraction and encoding time prediction
- illustrate computing system configured to perform CAPS using diagrams
- provide example results of CAPS using charts and graphs
