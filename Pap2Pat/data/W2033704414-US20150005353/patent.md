# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The invention generally relates to 5-alkylidenethiazolidine-2,4-dione and 3-alkylidene-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one analogs and their use as selective sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) inhibitors in clinical implications. In particular, the invention provides 5-alkylidenethiazolidine-2,4-dione and 3-alkylidene-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one analogs and derivatives thereof as SphK2 inhibitors and for use in the treatment of cancer.

2. Background of the Invention

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid metabolite, has been recognized and demonstrated as an important signaling mediator for vital cellular and physiological processes, such as cell motility, invasion, proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. S1P is produced from sphingosine by two kinases, namely, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). Upon production, S1P is secreted and interacts with a family of G-protein coupled receptors (S1P1-5) on the cell surface to impart a plethora of roles in the regulation of diverse physiological functions such as inflammation, immunity and angiogenesis. Recently, intracellular targets, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) and TRAF2, have been identified for S1P produced by SphK1 and SphK2, respectively, thus suggesting additional intracellular roles of this sphingolipid metabolite.

S1P and its biosynthetic precursors ceramide and sphingosine are the best characterized bioactive metabolites of sphingolipids. Ceramide and sphingosine have been associated with growth arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, S1P has been demonstrated to play important pro-survival roles. Therefore, the levels of these lipid metabolites need to be tightly controlled and a so called sphingolipid rheostat has been proposed to be crucial in determining cell fate. The regulation of the levels of these metabolites is complex and a number of enzymes have been demonstrated to play important roles, among which the SphKs have emerged as a central player in this complex system. SphKs are the key enzymes that catalyze the production of S1P. To date, two isoenzymes, SphK1 and SphK2 have been identified in human tissues. Although SphK1 and SphK2 share a high degree of homology, they have significant differences in size, tissue distribution, and subcellular localization, thus suggesting their distinct roles in regulation of different physiological functions. For example, SphK1 is mainly localized in the cytosol while SphK2 is present in several intracellular compartments, mainly in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Evidence has accumulated that SphK1 promotes cell growth and survival while the function of SphK2 is complex and controversial. Consistent with this notion, numerous studies have shown that SphK1 is frequently up-regulated and overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and SphK1 has been associated with many aspects of cancer progression such as proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. SphK1/S1P has also been implicated in the pathology of asthma, inflammatory diseases and sepsis. Compared to SphK1, much less is known about SphK2 and the results are contrasting. Initially, SphK2 had been demonstrated to be pro-apoptotic. For example, overexpression of SphK2 suppresses growth and promotes apoptosis. However, it has also been demonstrated that downregulation of SphK2 inhibits the proliferation and migration of tumor cells such as glioblastoma and breast cancer cells. These controversial results strongly suggest developing powerful and selective pharmacological tools for SphK2 to better understand the roles of SphK2 in different pathological conditions. Even though a number of pan-SphK and selective SphK1 inhibitors have been developed and reported, the development of SphK2-selective inhibitors remains limited and SphK2 inhibitors remain scarce, with only a few SphK2 inhibitors having been reported in the literature (e.g. ABC294620, SG-12, R-FTY720-OMe and trans-12). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop SphK2-selective inhibitors.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Development of isoform selective SphK inhibitors has attracted extensive attention as they may serve as valuable pharmacological tools to help decipher the physiological and pathological roles of SphKs and as effective therapeutic agents for human diseases, such as cancer. Even though several pan SphK inhibitors and SphK1 selective inhibitors have been developed and tested in preclinical experiments, selective SphK2 inhibitors remain scarce. During efforts to design and develop novel 5-alkylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives as dual-pathway inhibitors of the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, a family of 4-substituted-phenylpropylidene-thiazolidine-2,4-dione analogs were discovered to be highly selective SphK2 inhibitors. In addition, a series of 3-alkylidene-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one analogs has been designed to replace the thiazolidine-2,4-dione heterocycle and they also function as selective SphK2 inhibitors. Thus, these compounds, depicted in generic Formula I and generic Formula II, are selective SphK2 inhibitors and represent novel therapeutic agents, such as anticancer agents. In the Formulas which are depicted herein, the letters N, V, W, X, Y and Z represent atoms in the structures of the compounds which may vary as described herein, and do not represent elements such a vanadium, tungsten, etc.

In addition, the compounds or compositions of the invention may be administered in conjunction with other health-related and/or cancer treating substances or protocols, including but not limited to: dietary modifications (e.g. vitamin or antioxidant therapy); pain medication or procedures to lessen pain; radiation; various forms of chemotherapy (e.g. administration of platinum drugs, etc.; surgery; cryotherapy; and medications to lessen nausea, etc.).

The invention also provides methods of treating cancer in a patient in need thereof. The methods comprise a step of administering, to the patient, an effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulas I and/or II, e.g. as a composition comprising the compound(s). Methods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV), intratumoral, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. Frequently, administration will be IV, although the mode of administration is left to the discretion of the skilled practitioner (e.g. a physician). In most instances, administration will result in the release of a compound of the invention into the bloodstream. However, this need not always be the case, e.g. with topical or intratumoral administration. Further, modes of administration may be combined, e.g. intravenous and intratumoral administration may both be carried out in a patient.

The amount of the compound(s) of Formulas I and/or II that is administered in one administration is generally in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight of the patient, and is usually in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, with a goal of achieving levels of from about 1 to about 5 μM in the blood stream. Those of skill in the art will recognize that administration may be carried out according to any of several protocols, and will generally be determined by a skilled practitioner such as a physician. For example, administration may be once per day, several times per day, or less frequent (e.g. weekly, biweekly, etc.). The amount of the compound that is administered and the frequency of administration may depend on several factors, e.g. the characteristics of the patient (weight, age, gender, overall state of health, etc.); the type and stage of the cancer being treated; the response of the patient to the treatment; etc.

By “an effective amount” we mean an amount that is sufficient to ameliorate, lessen or eliminate symptoms of the disease that is being treated. While in some cases, the patient may be completely “cured” (disease symptoms disappear entirely), this need not always be the case. Those of skill in the art will recognize that substantial benefits may accrue if disease symptoms are only partially mitigated, or if the progress of the disease is slowed. For example, when treating cancer, substantial benefits re quality of life and longevity are obtained by slowing or arresting the growth of a tumor and/or preventing metastasis, shrinking (decreasing) the size of a tumor, etc. even if the tumor itself is not entirely destroyed by exposure to the compounds described herein. In some cases, the cancer cells which are exposed to the compounds of the invention are killed; in other embodiments, the cancer cells are damaged, e.g. prevented from growing or rendered incapable of cell division, etc.

Types of cancer that can be treated using the compounds and methods described herein include but are not limited to: leukemia, lymphoma, sarcoma, neuroblastoma, lung cancer, skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, brain cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer. The cancer may be at any stage of development, and pre-cancerous cells may also be treated.

The patient or subject that is treated in this manner is usually a mammal, although this is not always the case. Frequently, the mammal is a human, although the methods may also be applied to the treatment of other animals, e.g. in veterinary practice.

The invention also provides methods of inhibiting SphK2 and downstream signaling pathways in a cell. In some embodiments, inhibition of SphK2 is selective, e.g. the compound inhibits SphK2 but not other enzymes, for example, SphK1. In this embodiment, compound K11167 is excluded since it inhibits both SphK2 and SphK1. The methods involve exposing the cells to one or more compounds of the invention, the one or more compounds being present in an amount that is sufficient to inhibit the enzyme, SphK2, usually by at least 50%, in some cases by 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more, or even completely (i.e. 100% inhibition), compared to an untreated control. Those of skill in the art are familiar with methods to measure levels of inhibition of SphK2, e.g. by detecting the amount of a metabolite of SphK2 substrate or compound that participates in the downstream signaling pathway or that is made by or in the pathway, e.g. by measuring an amount or degree of mRNA or protein expression, or the amount of protein modification (e.g. phosphorylation or de-phosphorylation), etc. In some cases, the cells in which these pathways are inhibited are cancer cells.

The invention also provides methods of inhibiting SphK2. In some embodiments, inhibition of SphK2 is selective, e.g. the compound inhibits SphK2 but not other enzymes, for example, SphK1. In this embodiment, compound Klll67 is excluded since it inhibits both SphK2 and SphK1 (see FIGS. 5 and 6). The methods of the invention involve bringing the enzyme into contact with one or more compounds of the invention, e.g. by contacting, exposing or otherwise providing access of the compound(s) to the enzyme(s). The kinase may be an isolated purified or partially purified enzyme, or may be within a cell (e.g. in a cell cultured in vitro), or within and organism (in vivo). Generally, the activity of the kinase is inhibited by at least about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 95% or even more, e.g. about 100%, compared to a control enzyme which is not exposed to a compound of the invention. Those of skill in the art are familiar with methodology to measure the activity of enzymes, and of kinases in particular. For example, the ability of a kinase to carry out its usual enzymatic activity may be measured, e.g. by detecting a product of that activity.

The invention also provides methods of inhibiting SphK1 and SphK2 using the compound Klll67 (compound 42; see the Scheme in the Examples entitled “Compounds 28-36, 39-40 and 42 of Schemes 2 and 3”). Compound 42 may be used for any of the purposes described herein, e.g. for inhibiting SphK2, for treating diseases associated with SphK2, for killing or damaging cancer cells, for treating cancer, etc. However, its use is not selective for SphK2. Thus, compound 42 may also be used to inhibit SphK1, to treat diseases or conditions associated with SphK1, etc. In further embodiments, compound 42 may be used to inhibit both SphK1 and SphK2, e.g. in vitro or in cells.

The invention also provides methods of inhibiting growth or killing or damaging cells exhibiting positive SphK2 activity. By “positive” SphK2 activity we mean overactivation or overexpression of the kinase. In some embodiments, the cells are cancer cells. The methods involve exposing the cells to one or more compounds of the invention, the one or more compounds being present in an amount that is sufficient to cause the death of the cells, or to cause damage to the cells, e.g. to slow the cells' metabolism, prevent replication, prevent movement, induce apoptosis of the cells, etc. The cells that are killed or damaged may be in vitro or in vivo, i.e. this method may be carried out for clinical purposes (e.g. for the treatment of disease) or in the laboratory (e.g. the compounds of the invention may be used as laboratory reagents.) When a population of cancer cells is exposed to the compounds of the invention, generally about 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or more, e.g. even 100%, or the cells in the population are damaged or killed, compared to a suitable control population that is not exposed to the compounds.

Other embodiments of the invention include the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with positive SphK2 activity. These methods comprise the step of administering an effective amount of the compound of Formula I and/or Formula II or a composition thereof to a patient in need thereof to inhibit the SphK2 activity. Examples of such disease or conditions include but are not limited to cancer, arthrosclerosis, arthritis, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, inflammatory diseases and Alzheimer's disease. An “effective amount” or a “therapeutic amount” refers to an amount that either cures (i.e. symptoms of disease disappear completely or become undetectable), or ameliorates disease symptoms, e.g. by lessening symptoms such as pain, slowing of the growth of a tumor, lengthening the life of a patient, improving the quality of life of a patient, etc.

**In Vitro Test**

**SphK1 and SphK2 Test**

The results from FIGS. 1-6 demonstrate that Formula III (K145) and some other compounds of Formula I and Formula II significantly inhibit SphK2, but not SphK1, thus demonstrating they are selective SphK2 inhibitors. As shown in FIG. 1, Formula III (K145) dose-dependently inhibited SphK2 with a IC50 of 5 uM. Significantly, the results of FIG. 2 demonstrates that the potency of this type of SphK2 inhibitors from Formula I can be significantly improved by structural modification as Formula IV (KLIII16) with a longer alkyl chain has an IC50 of 1.9 uM compared to that of Formula III (K145).

**Kinetic Studies of Formula III (K145)**

As shown in FIG. 7, the kinetic studies of Formula III revealed that Formula III (K145) is a competitive inhibitor (with the substrate sphingosine) of SphK2 with a Ki value of 4.3±0.7M.

**Cell Viability Assays in Human Leukemia U937 Cells**

Cells were cultured at a density of 5×104 (U937) or 1×104 (PC-3, DU145, M12, HT29) cells per well in flat bottomed 96-well plates and treated with various concentrations of test compound at 37° C. (5% CO2). After 24 h, 20 μL, of CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 1 hour, the cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a micro-plate reader.

The results are presented in FIG. 8. These results show that Formula III (K145) inhibited the proliferation of tested cancer cells with an IC50 at single digit micromolar concentrations.

The results of Table 1 also show that Formula II compounds inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia U937 cells.

**Western Blot Analysis**

Cells (5×105 per ml) were treated with various concentrations of test compound at 37° C. (5% CO2) for 3 hrs, then stimulated with TPA at a final concentration of 200 nM for 20 min. Samples from whole-cell pellets were prepared and 30 μg protein for each condition was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and blocked with 5% fat-free milk for 30 min. The membrane is probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4° C. followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, BD Bioscience). The immunoreactive bands are detected by chemilluminescence methods (Pierce) and visualized on Kodak Omat film. The following primary antibodies were used: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2, Thr202/Tyr204), p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p90RSK (Thr359/Ser363), RSK1/RSK2/RSK3 (Cell Signaling). Blots were reprobed with antibodies against α-tubulin to ensure equal loading and transfer of proteins.

The results are presented in FIG. 9, which shows that Formula III (K145) significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of both ERK and Akt at 3 μM concentrations. The results are consistent with reported results that SphK execute their effects through, at least through, the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. As shown in FIG. 10, compounds S-II-71 and S-II-103 also inhibit the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, which indicates that inhibition of SphK2 by compounds from Formula II, interferes with the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.

**Cell Apoptosis Assays.**

Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) as staining reagent. Briefly, after treatment with test compound of varying concentrations for varying intervals (4, 8, 18, 36 hrs), cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid]/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaOH, 2.5 mM CaCl2). The cells were then incubated with annexin V—fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (BD PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.) and 5 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI), and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark per the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.) within 1 hr to determine the percentage of cells displaying annexin V staining (early apoptosis) or both annexin V and PI staining (late apoptosis).

The results are presented in FIG. 11, which shows that Formula III (K145) significantly and dose-dependently induced apoptosis in U937 cells. After 18 hrs, Formula III (K145) significantly induced apoptosis in U937 cells at 5 μM. At 10 μM concentration, Formula III (K145) significantly induced apoptosis at as early as 4 hrs treatment. As shown in FIG. 12, S-II-71 and S-II-103 from Formula II also induced apoptotic effects in U937 cells after 24 hrs treatment. Interestingly, S-II-71 induced both early and late apoptotic effect while S-II-103 mainly induced late apoptotic effects.

**In Vivo Studies**

**Anti-Proliferation of U937 Xenografts in Nude Mice.**

Female nude mice (BALB/c-nu, n=7) were inoculated with 3×107 U937 cells subcutaneously in the right flank. After 7 days of implant of U937 cells, mice were treated daily with Vehicle (control), or Tamibarotene (15 mg/Kg, positive control), or Formula III (K145) (15 mg/Kg) by i.p. administration. Tumor size was measured every other day. After 18 days treatment, mice were sacrificed and the tumor were removed and weighed.

The results are presented in FIG. 13A, K145 significantly inhibited the growth of U937 tumors in nude mice with a TGI of 44.2%, slightly less potent than tamibarotene (TGI=50.4%) after 17 days treatment. This is also reflected by the tumor weights of treatment groups (FIG. 13B). The tumor growth curve during the treatment course (FIG. 13C) also attests to the anti-tumor effects of K145 in this model. Lastly, as shown in FIG. 13D, the body weights of K145-treated mice remained the same as that of vehicle-treated mice, while tamibarotene treatment caused body weight decreases in the mice. These results strongly suggest that K145 exhibits comparable in vivo anti-tumor activity to tamibarotene, while concomitantly exhibiting less toxicity in this U937 xenograft cancer model.

**Anti-Growth of JC Xenografts in Syngenic BALB/c Mice.**

Female BALB/c mice (n=12) were injected with 1×106 JC cells subcutaneously in the flank, and treatment with the compound produced as described in Example 15 i.e. 3-(2-amino ethyl)-5-[3-(4-butoxyphenyl)-propylidene]-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Formula III-K145, 20 mg/kg and 35 mg/Kg dosage daily (i.p.) was started seven days after the tumor cell injection and stopped at day 15 after tumor injection. Mice were sacrificed at 15 days treatment.

As illustrated in FIG. 14A, treatment of BALB/c mice (n=8) bearing the JC xenograft significantly inhibited tumor growth at both doses with the higher dose being more potent. After 15 days treatment, the mean volume of the JC tumors in the treated-mice at both doses was >50% smaller than that in the vehicle-treated mice. Tumor weights of K145-treated mice were also significantly less than that in vehicle-treated mice in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 14B). Post-experiment visual evaluation of the tumor samples also confirms the results (FIG. 14D). We analyzed the tumor samples to detect K145, the change of S1P by ESI-MS/MS and the change of signaling pathways by Western blot. As shown in FIG. 14C, K145 was detected in JC tumors and the S1P level was suppressed compared to vehicle, consistent with the results from U937 cells assays. Notably, the p-ERK and p-Akt levels were decreased in the tumor samples compared to the vehicle controls (FIG. 14E), which is consistent with the results from U937 cells (FIG. 9). We did not observe significant changes in body weights and the major organs, such as heart, lung, liver and kidney, thus indicating a lack of general toxicity of K145.

**Anti-Proliferation of U937 Xenografts in Nude Mice by K145 Through Oral Administration.**

We examined the anticancer activity of K145 to inhibit the tumor growth of U937 cells in nude mice (BALB/c-nu) by oral administration to investigate whether it is orally available. In this experiment, K145 was given at 50 mg/kg by oral gavage daily for 15 days and tumor volume and animal weights were measured every other day. Again, tamibarotene (20 mg/kg) was used as positive control. As shown in FIG. 15A, tumor weights of K145-treated mice were significantly less than that in vehicle-treated mice and K145 exhibited better antitumor activity than tamibarotene at tested doses by oral administration (TGI for K145 and tamibarotene are 51.25% and 33.37%, respectively). Visual examination of the tumor samples also confirmed the significant inhibition of U937 tumor growth by K145 (FIG. 15B). Tumor growth curve also demonstrated the superior anti-tumour activity of K145 in these experimental settings (FIG. 15C). As shown in FIG. 15D, at the beginning of the treatment, there was a slight decrease of body weights in K145-treated group but the body weights of this group came back in the remaining course of the study. Collectively, the results of in vivo studies with K145 by oral administration demonstrated that K145 is orally available to inhibit the growth of U937 tumors at 50 mg/kg dose and no apparent toxicity was observed, which is consistent with the results from in vivo studies by i.p. injection administration.

**In Vitro Target Validation of K145**

Next we examined whether K145 affects cellular levels of S1P. Human leukemia U937 cells have been demonstrated to be a good model to test compounds that interfere with the SphK/S1P system and it has previously been shown that S1P is protective against apoptosis of U937 cells. Therefore, we further characterized K145 in U937 cells. As shown in FIG. 16A, K145 is readily taken up by U937 cells in a concentration dependent manner. As shown in FIGS. 16B and 16C, treatment with K145 (10 μM) caused a decrease of total cellular S1P without significant effects on ceramide levels. The inhibitory potency of K145 on cellular level of S1P is somewhat less than its IC50 (4.3 μM) determined at recombinant SphK2. This might be due to the fact that many enzymes such as SphK1, SphK2, S1P lyase, and S1P phosphatise, not just SphK2, are involved in the regulation of cellular S1P. The level of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) was not significantly affected upon treatment with K145 (10 μM, FIG. 16D), which indicates that K145 does not interfere with CERK and/or ceramide synthase, consistent with the results from recombinant CERK studies. To further confirm its SphK2 selectivity, we then tested the effects of K145 on the phosphorylation of FTY720, a SphK2 specific substrate [35]. As shown in FIG. 16E, K145 inhibited the phosphorylation of FTY720, which further indicates the SphK2 specificity of K145.
