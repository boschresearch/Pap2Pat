    "abstract": "Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a blinding eye disease, is characterized by pathological protein- and lipid-rich drusen deposits underneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and atrophy of the RPE monolayer in advanced disease stages - leading to photoreceptor cell death and vision loss. Currently, there are no drugs that stop drusen formation or RPE atrophy in AMD. Here we provide an iPSC-RPE AMD model that recapitulates drusen and RPE atrophy. Drusen deposition is dependent on AMD-risk-allele CFH(H/H) and anaphylatoxin triggered alternate complement signaling via the activation of NF-\u03baB and downregulation of autophagy pathways. Through high-throughput screening we identify two drugs, L-745,870, a dopamine receptor antagonist, and aminocaproic acid, a protease inhibitor that reduce drusen deposits and restore RPE epithelial phenotype in anaphylatoxin challenged iPSC-RPE with or without the CFH(H/H) genotype. This comprehensive iPSC-RPE model replicates key AMD phenotypes, provides molecular insight into the role of CFH(H/H) risk-allele in AMD, and discovers two candidate drugs to treat AMD.",

                "MD is one of the leading causes of vision loss in adults over the age of 50 1 . It is a polygenic disease with aging and cigarette smoking as key risk factors that trigger risk alleles to manifest with age 1 . Clinically, AMD presents in two forms-wet AMD or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and dry AMD. Dry AMD is characterized by the presence of protein and lipid-rich sub-RPE deposits called drusen. The advanced stage of dry AMD, geographic atrophy (GA), leads to vision loss and often blindness, is characterized by irreversible degeneration of the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 2,3 . RPE is a monolayer of polarized hexagonal cells that maintain photoreceptor health by performing several functions, including nutrient and fluid transport between the photoreceptors and the choroidal blood supply and phagocytosis of worn-out photoreceptor outer segments (POS) 3 . Photoreceptor cell death in GA is initiated by functional atrophy of the RPE and the choriocapillaris, and accelerated by the eventual loss of the RPE 3,4 . Although the exact cause of RPE atrophy and cell death is not known, degenerative changes within the Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris leading to reduced nutrient supply is thought to damage both RPE and photoreceptor cell health 5 . There is currently no treatment available for dry AMD because the mechanism of drusen formation and RPE atrophy are not well understood.",
                "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked several genetic variants to AMD pathogenesis 4 . Several of the variants are in genes regulating the alternate complement pathway (e.g., complement factor H (CFH), complement factor I (CFI), complement C3, complement factor B (CFB)), one of three complement pathways that leads to downstream complement effector functions via the activation of CFB mediated C3 convertase; CFH and CFI are known to inhibit this activation 6 . Activation of C3 convertase and its downstream effector C5 convertase leads to the formation of anaphylatoxins-C3a and C5a 6 . Discoveries from GWAS are substantiated by recent biomarker studies that uncovered increased expression of C3a and C5a in the eyes of AMD patients [6][7][8][9] . Furthermore, increased expression of anaphylatoxins is seen in the AMD retina and stressed RPE cells independent of their AMD-risk genotype, suggesting a locally activated alternate complement involvement in AMD 8,9 . However, how C3a and C5a proteins induce AMD pathology in the RPE is not well understood. Intracellular activity of C3a and C5a is mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors, C3aR1 and C5aR1 6 . In immune cells, the activation of these receptors activates AKT and ERK1/2 kinases, which triggers NF-\u03baB activation leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines 6 . Canonical NF-\u03baB activation from an inflammatory stimulus also leads to the inhibition of autophagy 10 , resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins, a potential source of sub-RPE drusen deposits 11 .",
                "Recent use of animal models has provided critical insight into the role of complement in RPE physiology and degeneration [12][13][14] . Several in vitro models of AMD pathobiology have also been proposed using the primary human, mouse, pig RPE, and AMD iPSC-RPE (iRPE) [15][16][17][18] . Some of these studies were able to recapitulate sub-RPE drusen deposits. Others have linked the formation of these deposits to monogenic forms of retinal degeneration or the components of human serum, specifically, anaphylatoxin C3a 17 . However, a thorough analysis of RPE phenotype and changes in intracellular pathways induced by C3a or C5a complement proteins, leading to RPE atrophy, was not provided. Furthermore, no drug has been proposed to ameliorate the effect of complement proteins on RPE or rescue RPE atrophy seen in AMD patients.",
                "In this work, we replicate AMD cellular phenotypes, including sub-RPE APOE and lipid deposits, and atrophy in fully mature iRPE monolayer that is derived from with CFH(H/H), CFH(Y/Y), and CFH(Y/H) variants. Complement competent human serum (CC-HS)-a source for anaphylatoxins (activated complement) is used, as a surrogate for age-induced increase in alternate complement pathway seen in AMD eyes 8,9 , to recapitulate AMD cellular phenotypes in iRPE cells. iRPE with the CFH(H/H) highrisk allele for AMD show higher baseline APOE and lipid deposition as compared to the low-risk variant CFH(Y/Y). In both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE, the AMD disease phenotypes are mediated by C3a-C3aR1 and C5a-C5aR1 signalinginduced NF-\u03baB activation, autophagy downregulation, and dysregulated intracellular calcium homeostasis. A high-throughput screen using a commercially available library of pharmaceutically active compounds (LOPAC) leads to the discovery of two drugs that consistently ameliorate anaphylatoxin-induced signaling alterations in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells and suppress AMD cellular phenotypes in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE-making these drugs as likely candidates for pharmaceutical interventions of dry AMD."

                                "Published GWAS studies have demonstrated that two risk alleles have the highest associations with AMD-rs10490924, T/T in locus ARMS2/HTRA1 and rs1061170, C/C (leading to a homozygous substitution of amino acid tyrosine (Y) to histidine (H) at location 402) in gene CFH 19,20 . Here, we focused on the CFH risk allele, CFH(H/H) that increases the likelihood of dry AMD by 4.4-fold as compared to its Y/Y counterpart, whereas the heterozygous allele CFH(Y/H) provides an intermediate risk to AMD [19][20][21] . To develop an in vitro AMD model that works with all three categories of CFH alleles, we tested four iPSCs lines with high-risk allele CFH(H/H), three iPSC lines with the low-risk allele CFH(Y/Y), and three iPSC lines heterozygous for the allele CFH(Y/H) 21 (Supplementary Table 1 andTable 1). To reduce the risk profile of ARMS2/HTRA1 risk allele for our analysis, we used iPSCs that were, in most cases, heterozygous for rs10490924, G/ T 21 .",
                                "iPSCs were differentiated into mature and polarized RPE cells using our published protocols (see \"Methods\" for details) 22,23 . Maturity of both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) iRPE was confirmed by the nuclear to cell membrane translocation of \u03b2-CATENIN (Fig. 1a,b), suggesting the formation of tight junctions between neighboring cells 22 iRPE polarization was confirmed by apically located EZRIN, a marker of RPE apical processes (Supplementary ",
                                "Fig. 1a-d). Both CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE showed a similar pattern of \u03b2-CATENIN and EZRIN localization in mature iRPE (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1a-d), suggesting comparable maturation and polarization of iRPE with the two CFH genotypes. To test our hypothesis of a critical role of anaphylatoxins in AMD pathogenesis, we treated mature iRPE monolayer derived from CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) donors with complement competent human serum (CC-HS) with activated anaphylatoxins or complement incompetent human serum (CI-HS) with an inhibited activity of anaphylatoxins 15 . CC-HS treatment led to a dramatic increase in APOE-positive sub-RPE deposits both in CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE (Fig. 1c,d). Cross-section views of iRPE monolayer revealed a significant change in APOE localization from predominantly apical in CI-HS treated samples to a strong sub-cellular signal that was seen both above and inside the membrane (white arrowheads, Fig. 1e,f), similar to the previous observations 15,16 . Consistent with drusen deposits seen in AMD eyes and in RPE cultures 15,24 , APOE- positive deposits co-stained with an anti-membrane attack complex (C5b-9) antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1e). iRPE monolayer cross and en face sections stained with Nile red and Oil Red O revealed increased intracellular and sub-RPE accumulation of lipids in CC-HS-treated iRPE as compared to CI-HS treated cells (blue arrowhead points to intracellular signal and white to sub-RPE signal-Fig. 1g-j and Supplementary Fig. 1f-i-white circles show intracellular signal) 16,25 . The presence of intracellular lipid deposits in CC-HS-treated iRPE cells was further confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (yellow arrowhead, Fig. 1l, compared to 1k). Sub-RPE deposits seen in TEM (red arrowhead, Fig. 1l) were further characterized by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (red arrowheads, Supplementary Fig. 1j-m) and high-magnification TEM images (red arrowheads, Supplementary Fig. 1n-q). TEM clearly showed that deposits were located under the RPE cell basal membrane (blue arrowheads, Supplementary Fig. 1n-q). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) further confirmed the presence of sub-RPE, often dome-shaped, deposits in CC-HS-treated samples (red arrowheads, Fig. 1m, n and Supplementary Fig. 1r-u). Together, these findings support our hypothesis that CC-HS treatment induces hallmark disease phenotypes of AMD in iRPE monolayer derived from both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) donors.",
                                "We hypothesized that AMD-associated CFH risk allele (Y402H) 19,20 in iRPE cells locally controls the activation of C3 into anaphylatoxin C3a and predisposes CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells toward diseases. Under basal (CI-HS treated) conditions, CFH(H/ H)-iRPE formed 2\u00d7 higher APOE deposits as compared to CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE (P < 0.001; Fig. 1o) and these numbers in CFH(H/H)-iRPE did not change significantly under CC-HS conditions (P = ns; Fig. 1o). In comparison, CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE cells formed 2\u00d7 higher APOE under CC-HS as compared to CI-HStreated conditions (P < 0.001; Fig. 1o). Similar to the APOE data, lipid accumulation-as quantified by BODIPY and Nile red stains -was between 2 and 10\u00d7 higher in CFH(H/H)-iRPE under basal conditions as compared to CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE (P < 0.05 for Fig. 1p and P < 0.001 for Fig. 1q). Both BODIPY (8-14\u00d7, P < 0.001) and Nile red (3-4\u00d7, P < 0.001) signals increased in both CFH(H/H)-iRPE and CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE under CC-HS conditions (Fig. 1p,q). Taken together, these results suggest that, as compared to CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE, CFH(H/H)-iRPE show higher disease susceptibility at the baseline. CC-HS increases lipid deposits in both genotypes albeit to varying degrees allowing us to discern specific effects of AMD genotype on disease phenotypes."

Loss of epithelial phenotype and RPE atrophy are seen in AMD eyes 26,27 . We asked if CC-HS treatment induces atrophy in this iRPE model via the loss of RPE junctional integrity. TEM of CC-HS-treated cells revealed disintegrated junctional complexes between neighboring RPE cells derived from CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iPSCs (arrowhead in Fig. 2a,b). To further investigate the integrity of the tight junctions between adjacent RPE cells in CC-HS-treated samples, we stained the cells for CLDN19-a tight junction protein 24 . CLDN19 was missing from cell borders and localized intracellularly in CC-HS-treated CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE samples (arrowheads in Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). F-ACTIN staining displayed intracellular stress fibers in CC-HS-treated iRPE cells that failed to retain their characteristic hexagonal morphology reminiscent of transition from AMD phenotype 2 to phenotype 3 when cells start losing their characteristic epithelial phenotype 27 (arrowheads in Fig. 2d). We asked whether these structural changes in RPE cell morphology translated into functional differences in their ability to maintain tight junctions-as measured by TER of the monolayer. The baseline TER of CFH(H/H)-iRPE was 25% lower as compared to the TER of CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE (P < 0.001; Fig. 2e). Upon CC-HS stimulation CFH(H/H)-iRPE saw a drop of 85% in TER, whereas TER of CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE dropped by 70% (P < 0.001; Fig. 2e). Under baseline conditions, we noticed a 50% lower ability of CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells to phagocytose photoreceptor outer segments (POS) conditions as compared to CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 2f). Upon CC-HS stimulation, both CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE further lost their ability to phagocytose POS by fiveto sixfold (P < 0.001; Fig. 2f). These results suggest that CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/ H)-iRPE have baseline differences in their functional capacity and it deteriorates further in both genotypes under the complement challenge similar to what is seen in AMD eyes.",

VIMENTIN expression was predominantly on the cell membrane in CI-HS and non-treated CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) iRPE cells but was missing from the cell membrane and did not form an organized cytoskeleton network in elongated CC-HS treated CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) iRPE cells (arrowheads, Fig. 2j, k and Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), similar to RPE dedifferentiation seen at the borders of GA lesion in cadaver AMD eyes (Supplementary Fig. 2e-h). Overall, our results showed that CC-HS treatment induces the most notable features seen in AMD RPE-the formation of APOE and lipid-containing sub-cellular deposits, and RPE atrophy through cellular dedifferentiation-a phenotype associated with advanced disease stages.",
                                        "CC-HS triggers C3a/C5aR1 signaling in iRPE cells. The anaphylatoxin arm of the complement pathway acts via C3a-C3aR1 and C5a-C5aR1 signaling 6 . We checked if the CC-HS treatment led to changes in expression of CFH and the two anaphylatoxins in CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE. ELISA showed that as compared to CI-HS treatment, CC-HS treatment led to 24-30fold higher CFH secretion on the basal, but not the apical, side of CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE [30-fold for CFH(Y/Y) and 24fold for CFH(H/H), P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 3a). CC-HS also led to several fold higher apical (C3a:7-fold for CFH(Y/Y), P < 0.001 and 5-fold for CFH(H/H), P < 0.05; C5a: threefold for CFH(Y/Y), P < 0.001 and 1.7-fold for CFH(H/H), P = ns) and basal (C3a: 1.4-fold for CFH(Y/Y), P < 0.05 and 5.6-fold for CFH(H/H), P < 0.05; C5a: 1.2-fold for CFH(Y/Y), P < 0.05 and threefold for CFH(H/H), P = ns) levels of C3a and C5a (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c). Baseline or CC-HS induced differences between CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE were not significant. Overall, these results confirmed that CC-HS treatment causes RPE cells to activate the alternate complement pathway in a cellautonomous fashion that likely contributes to RPE pathology.",
                                        "To decipher the mechanism of C3a and C5a signaling mediated AMD phenotype induction in iRPE cells, we checked the expression and localization of receptors, C3aR1 and C5aR1. RNAseq confirmed the expression of both receptors in iRPE cells with ~30\u00d7 higher expression of C5aR1 as compared to C3aR1 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Western blot showed the presence of C3aR1 and C5aR1 receptors in the membrane fraction of iRPE cells (Fig. 3a). Immunostaining of mature iRPE cells and RPE from cadaver human eyes confirmed the localization of C3aR1 and C5aR1 both on the apical and the basal sides of RPE cells, with stronger labeling in iRPE on the apical side (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Fig. 3e-n). To verify that CC-HS activates C3aR1 and C5aR1 in iRPE cells, we analyzed phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, the two key kinases downstream of C3aR1 and C5aR1 receptors 32 . Western blot for CC-HS treated samples from CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE showed 7-8x increase in   levels of pAKT (P < 0.001) and 2-3\u00d7 increase in levels of p-ERK1/ 2 (P < 0.001) as compared to CI-HS treated cells (Fig. 3d-g). Furthermore, consistent with the dominant apical localization of C3aR1 and C5aR1 in iRPE, apical only treatment of CC-HS was sufficient to cause the 4-5\u00d7 TER drop (P < 0.001) caused by the combined apical/basal treatment. In contrast, the basal only treatment of CC-HS resulted in a twofold TER drop (P < 0.01; Fig. 3h). Lower efficacy of CC-HS on the basal iRPE side is also consistent with over 200\u00d7 increase in the basal secretion of CFH upon CC-HS treatment, whereas no increase in apical-side CFH secretion was noted (Supplementary Fig. 3a).  33 and C5aR1 (PMX053, 10 \u03bcM) 6 in CC-HS serum (P < 0.05) resulted in two-to fivefold lower sub-RPE APOE deposits as compared to CC-HS plus vehicle treatment (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 3o-t). Depletion of complement factor D, an upstream regulator of C3a and C5a formation, also led to lower sub-RPE APOE deposits as compared to complete CC-HS medium 32 (Supplementary Fig. 3s). Similarly, as compared to CI-HS treated samples, no changes in TER were observed in CFH(Y/ H), CFH(Y/Y), and CFH(H/H)-iRPE monolayer treated with sera depleted in C3 (P < 0.001) or C5 (P < 0.001) or in iRPE cotreated with CC-HS and blockers for C3aR1 and C5aR1 receptors (compstatin, 10 \u03bcM and PMX053, 10 \u03bcM respectively; P < 0.001; Fig. 3j; Supplementary Fig. 3u). In summary, our data indicate that stimulation of C3aR1 and C5aR1 complement receptors on iRPE monolayers is required for triggering AMD phenotype in both CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE."

Principal component analysis of the data revealed a globally different gene expression pattern induced by CC-HS treatment and showed similar changes across iRPE derived from the three genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 4a-heatmap shows sample distance). Consistent with the effect of anaphylatoxins C3a, C5a in immune cells 6,32,34 , autophagy (P < 0.001) and TNF/ NF-\u03baB (P < 0.001) were the pathways most affected by CC-HS treatment in iRPE with both CFH(Y/Y) and (H/H) alleles (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This led us to hypothesize that C3aR1-C3a and C5aR1-C5a signaling in iRPE cells is a pivotal regulator of these two pathways. Indeed, CC-HS treatment caused the p65 (RELA) subunit of NF-\u03baB to translocate to the nucleus in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 4d-o). Furthermore, CC-HS treatment increased the expression of NF-\u03baB target genes in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE 35 -as confirmed by ( 1) RNAseq (Supplementary Fig. 4c, P < 0.001); (2) qRT-PCR for IL-6, IL-8, GADD45B, EGR2, NF-\u03baB1A, REL1, NF-\u03baB1, SNAP25 (Fig. 4c, P < 0.01-P < 0.001); (3) immunostaining for RELB and TRAF3 (Supplementary Fig. 4p-s); and (4) a twofold increased secretion of NK-\u03baB pathway inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 (Fig. 3d, apical P < 0.05, basal P < 0.001) and IL-18 (Supplementary Fig. 4t, apical P < 0.05, basal P < 0.05). Predominant cytoplasmic localization of p65 in CFH(Y/Y), CFH(H/H), and CFH(Y/H)-iRPE cells treated with sera depleted in CFD, C3, or C5 proteins provided further evidence that anaphylatoxins directly activate the NF-\u03baB pathway in iRPE cells (Fig. 4e-g and Supplementary Fig. 5a-r). To determine if NF-\u03baB activation directly led to the formation of sub-RPE APOE-positive deposits, we derived iRPE cells from a patient with an E391X truncating mutation in the NEMO gene-a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling 36 . Consistent with the literature, constitutive nuclear translocation of p65 was observed in NEMO mutant iRPE cells even under CI-HS treatment (Fig. 4h). In addition, a 5-6\u00d7 increase in sub-RPE APOE-positive deposits were detected in mutant iRPE cells under CI-HS treatment conditions (P < 0.001; Fig. 4i,j). Overall, these results demonstrate that the anaphylatoxinstriggered AMD disease phenotypes in iRPE cells are mediated through the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway.",
                                        "RNAseq analysis also revealed statistically significant (P < 0.001) downregulation of autophagy pathway genes in CC-HS treated CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This prompted us to investigate the role of autophagy in CC-HSinduced AMD phenotypes in iRPE. Immunostaining and western blot analyses revealed that genes integral for autophagy regulation, ATG5, ATG7, and LC3-II, were all three-to fourfold downregulated in CC-HS-treated CFH(Y/Y), CFH(Y/H), and CFH(H/H)-iRPE, compared to CI-HS-treated iRPE cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 5a-i and Supplementary Fig. 6a-n). These results were further corroborated by qRT-PCR, which showed 4-16fold downregulated expression of critical autophagy pathway genes (P < 0.01-0.001 for ATG3, ATG12, ATG4B, ATG4D, BCL2, LAMP1, SQSTM1, MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B) in CC-HStreated iRPE cells, as compared to CI-HS-treated iRPE cells (Supplementary Fig. 6o). Reduced expression of key autophagy genes in CC-HS treated cells suggested reduced autophagy flux, which was confirmed by increased accumulation of autophagosomes inside CC-HS-treated iRPE cells (Supplementary Fig. 6p, q, arrowhead and inset with higher magnification) 37 .",
                                        "Consistent with the dominant apical localization of C3aR1 and C5aR1 in iRPE, treatment of CC-HS on the apical side (P < 0.001) only of CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE was sufficient to induce downregulation of LC3-II, a major marker for autophagy (P = ns between both sides CC-HS and apical only CC-HS treatment; Fig. 5j and Supplementary Fig. 6r). Furthermore, unlike CC-HS-treated cells, CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells treated with CC-HS sera depleted in C3 or C5 proteins were incapable of inducing autophagy downregulation and performed similarly to CI-HS (P < 0.05 CI-HS vs CC-HS; P = ns CI-HS vs C5 depl. or C3 dept CC-HS; Fig. 5k, and Supplementary Fig. 6s,t). Similarly, iRPE cells cotreated with CC-HS and C3aR1 + C5aR1 blockers behaved similar to CI-HS-treated samples and did not show a statistically significant reduction in LC3 levels (P = ns for CI-HS vs C3aR1 + C5aR1 blockers + CC-HS; Fig. 5k, and Supplementary Fig. 6s). These results confirm that the anaphylatoxin signaling C3aR1 and C5aR1 inhibits autophagy in CC-HS-treated iRPE cells.",
                                        "To further understand the sequence of events leading to the formation of sub-RPE APOE deposits, we performed a temporal analysis of NF-\u03baB activation and autophagy downregulation after the addition of CC-HS on iRPE cells. Within 6 h of CC-HS addition, nuclear translocation of p65 was evident in a few cells, and over 24 h, this translocation was observed in most of the cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a-e). Similarly, LC3-II downregulation could be seen within 6 h of CC-HS treatment peaking by 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 7f-k). In contrast, a 3.7\u00d7 increase in APOE deposits was observed only after 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 7l-o), indicating that NF-\u03baB upregulation and autophagy downregulation precede the formation of APOE deposits in CC-HS-treated iRPE cells.",
                                        "High-throughput screen discovered drugs rescue iRPE atrophy. RNAseq revealed a defect in the intracellular calcium homeostasis pathway in CC-HS-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b). This observation was supported by literature evidence of sub-RPE calcium nodules associated with AMD 38 and by intracellular calcium-level measurements in CC-HS-or CI-HS-treated iRPE cells. The baseline calcium levels in CI-HS-and CC-HS-treated cells were similar (100-120 nM; Fig. 6a-c). But, the application of extracellular ATP, a key signaling molecule in numerous RPE cellular processes, only weakly activated the release of calcium from intracellular stores in CC-HS-treated cells resulting in a two and a half-fold lower ATP-evoked [Ca 2+ ] i response compared to CI-HS-treated cells (Fig. 6a-c, P < 0.05). Calcium is a key mediator of RPE junctional integrity and several intracellular signaling pathways, leading us to hypothesize that calcium homeostasis defects are central to AMD cellular phenotypes seen in CC-HStreated cells. To test this hypothesis, we designed a drug screen around calcium homeostasis defect-induced iRPE cell death. A calcium ionophore A23187, similar to CC-HS treatment leads to calcium homeostasis defect and RPE cell death was used for the drug screen 39 (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 8a). At 96 h, all three concentrations of A23187 (2.5, 10, 25 \u03bcM) led to >75% cell death, at 48 h, 2.5 \u03bcM caused 50% cell death, and 10 \u03bcM caused 70% cell death (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 8a). In total, 10 \u03bcM concentration and 48-h treatment of A23187 were selected for the drug screening because it provided a larger window for cell death rescue.",
                                        "A commercially available library of pharmaceutically active compounds (LOPAC) with 1280 drugs was used for the screen at two different concentrations, 9.2 \u03bcM and 46 \u03bcM. Drug treatment, along with the stressor, 10 \u03bcM A23187, were added on iRPE cells matured in 384-well plates, and cell death was scored 48 h later by ATP release using the CellTitrGlo TM assay 40 . Comparable relative mean intensity of signal across all the assay plates containing A23187 confirmed consistency and reproducibility of the screen (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Normalized cell death signal exhibited that plates 7-10, with the lower drug concentration (9.2 \u03bcM), had reduced cell death as compared to plates with the higher drug concentration (46 \u03bcM) (Supplementary Fig. 8c). At 9.2 \u03bcM 45 drugs showed improved (>40%) cell survival in A23187-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 8d).",

To distinguish false positives from the real signals and confirm drug efficacy across iRPE with both low and high-risk for AMD, we performed a followup screen on the 45 identified candidate drugs using CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE. The follow-up screen was performed at three different A23187 concentrations (2.5, 5, 10 \u03bcM) and with seven different concentrations of drugs ranging from 0.78 to 50 \u03bcM (Supplementary Fig. 8e-g). Only two drugs, L745,870 (L745) and aminocaproic acid (ACA) (Fig. 6e,f), exhibited reproducible cytoprotective activity across both CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/ H)-iRPE, confirming our initial observation of false-positive effects across several 384-well plate lanes (Supplementary Fig. 8d).",

Overall, these results demonstrated that the two drugs discovered in our HTS were able to reverse intracellular pathways that mediated anaphylatoxin-induced AMD phenotype in iRPE cells with both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) genotypes. These results prompted us to further test the effect of these drugs on AMD cellular phenotypes, RPE-epithelial atrophy, and cellular functions.",
                                        "Drugs ameliorate AMD phenotypes in iRPE cells. The hallmark AMD cellular phenotypes seen in cadaver eyes and observed in our in vitro model are the sub-RPE lipid and protein-rich deposits, loss of RPE-epithelial phenotype, and RPE dedifferentiation that leads to atrophy of cells 41,42 . We tested if the two drugs could rescue any of these phenotypes in CC-HS-treated cells derived from CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) iPSCs. CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE cotreated with CC-HS and L745 or ACA had 40-60% lower levels of cholesterol and triglycerides deposits as compared to CC-HS + vehicle-treated samples, as measured by Nile red staining (Fig. 7a; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + L745, P < 0.01; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + ACA, P < 0.001). Similarly, the cotreatment of CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE with CC-HS and L745 led to a 4\u00d7 reduction in lipids, as measured by BODIPY staining (Fig. 7b; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + L745, P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 11a-c). But the levels of APOEpositive deposits did not change significantly upon a 48-h cotreatment of L745 or ACA together with CC-HS (Fig. 7c). This led us to test whether a longer-term drug treatment could reduce sub-RPE APOE-positive deposits. Indeed, a 7-day drug treatment that started 24 h after CC-HS was able reduce APOE deposits by up to twofold by both drugs (Fig. 7d; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + L745, P < 0.001; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + ACA, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 11d-g).",
                                        "Loss of RPE-epithelial phenotype was analyzed by VIMENTIN expression in cells. Misshapen, less compact cells with higher cytoplasmic (less membrane) expression of dedifferentiation markers like VIMENTIN are considered to have lost the epithelial phenotype and undergoing dedifferentiation 31 . Cotreatment of iRPE with CC-HS treated plus L745 or ACA reduced the cytoplasmic expression (star in Fig. 7h,l) of VIMENTIN in both CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE and increased its membrane expression (arrowheads in Fig. 7e-g, i-k) similar to what is seen in CI-HS-treated and non-treated iRPE (Fig. 7e, i and Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). Consistently RNAseq of CFH(Y/Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE treated with CC-HS plus the vehicle or cotreated with CC-HS and the two drugs revealed four-to tenfold lower expression of dedifferentiation markers in CC-HS + drug-treated iRPE, as compared to CC-HS + vehicletreated cells (Supplementary Fig. 11h). Combined together immunostaining and RNAseq data suggested the two drugs are able to successfully restore epithelial phenotype both in CFH(Y/ Y)-iRPE and CFH(H/H)-iRPE.",
                                        "Rescue of epithelial morphology prompted us to check if the two drugs rescued RPE functionality in CC-HS treated cells. TER, a measure of junctional integrity, of CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE monolayers cotreated with drugs and CC-HS, was two-to threefold higher (P < 0.001) as compared to iRPE treated with CC-HS + vehicle (Fig. 7m and Supplementary Fig. 11i). Furthermore, the addition of either drug improved (up to twofold; P < 0.001) the ability of CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE cells to phagocytose POS, as compared to cells treated with CC-HS and the vehicle (Fig. 7n and Supplementary Fig. 11j). To further validate the ability of these drugs as potential therapies for AMD, we tested whether treatment of these drugs after the start of the complement insult would halt disease progression. In fact, a 24-h treatment of L745 or ACA started 24-h after the start of CC-HS treatment is sufficient to cause a 3-4\u00d7 reduction in lipid deposits as confirmed by Nile red staining (Fig. 7o; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + L745, P < 0.001; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + ACA, P < 0.001) and a 9\u00d7 reduction in lipids, as confirmed by BODIPY staining (Fig. 7p; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + L745, P < 0.001; CC-HS + vehicle vs CC-HS + ACA, P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 11k-m).",

These drugs also reversed RPE atrophy and restored its functionality. Our in vitro data provide evidence to support the potential use of these drugs to delay AMD disease initiation and slow its progression on iRPE with high-risk alleles for AMD."

                                "In a human iPSC-derived platform, our work replicates two key cellular phenotypes of AMD-sub-RPE deposits and RPE atrophy. We demonstrate that these phenotypes are associated with one of the highest risk alleles for AMD, CFH(H/H). Activated alternate complement exaggerates AMD cellular phenotypes in high-risk iRPE underscoring the crosstalk between AMD genetics and environmental factors (Fig. 8a-d) 9,43 . Our work also unveiled two clinically tested drugs that rescue AMD phenotypes in both CFH(H/H) and CFH(Y/Y) alleles, making them strong candidates with the potential to work on diverse AMD genotypes. The establishment of this complement-based iRPE model, its direct connection to the CFH risk allele and with readouts directly linked to AMD cellular phenotypes in the RPE forms a basis for testing additional anti-AMD drugs and discovering the role of other AMD-risk alleles in disease etiology.",
                                "Our working hypothesis is that there is a local source (likely retinal and RPE) of C3a and/or C5a leading to the activation of corresponding receptors C3aR1 and C5aR1 on the RPE surface. Our ELISA data show a cell-autonomous C3a and C5a source in stressed RPE cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a-c). Several previous publications support this hypothesis and suggest aged/stressed RPE and photoreceptors as potential sources of activated complement: (1) Katschke et al. recently demonstrated that POS could locally activate complement in the retina 9 . Strong immunostaining for C3 could be detected in POS of AMD eyes; (2) POS as a source of C3 and C5 leading to RPE atrophy is consistent with a previous observation of recurrence of RPE atrophy in dry-AMD patients after a full macular translocation procedure 44 ; (3) Multiple reports have demonstrated that RPE cells exposed to physiological stressors can be an autonomous source of complement C3 and C3a [45][46][47] . Although all this work doesn't rule out an alternative complement source coming from the systemic circulation or the choroid, likely through \"leaky\" endothelial cells, our data and these published studies favor a local complement source 48 . RPE cells also express several complement inhibitors, including CD46, CD55, CFD, CFH, and CFI (Supplementary Fig. 12), which can suppress alternate complement pathway activation. Our data suggest that these RPE defenses are weakened by genetic defects in complement pathway proteins (e.g., CFH, C/C, rs1061170) and by environmental changes that increase C3a and C5a levels around RPE cells-similar to CC-HS stimulation used in our model here. Overt activation of C3aR1 and C5aR1, as it happens by CC-HS treatment in our model or slowly as it may happen through tick-over activation of C3a and C5a around RPE cells with age, suppresses the expression of most of these complement inhibitors in RPE cells (Supplementary Fig. 12). The reduced expression of complement inhibitors, combined with lower CFH secretion on the apical side (Supplementary Fig. 3a) further weakens RPE defense mechanism and leads to a vicious cycle of RPE atrophy. Combining these reports with our data, we suggest that uncontrolled complement activation triggered over time by age-associated changes in the retina, the RPE, and the choroid slowly lead to AMD initiating events such as sub-RPE deposits, loss of RPE polarization and functionality, and eventual RPE atrophy.",
                                "Here, we report on the role of anaphylatoxins in inducing atrophy and dedifferentiation in RPE cells. Our results are consistent with the known role of C3a and C5a in causing epithelial cell dedifferentiation in liver and cancer cells 49 . RPE dedifferentiation has been reported in AMD patients' eyes 26,27 , and in high-fat diet-fed aged cfh + /-mice 13 , linking our work to these in vivo observations. C5a depletion is sufficient to ameliorate AMD cellular phenotypes in iRPE cells. Since C5a is downstream of C3a, it suggests a dominant role for C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AMD pathogenesis. However, activation of both C3a and C5a signaling has been reported in atrophic AMD and CNV animal models 9,43 . The drug screen presented here provides a proof-of-concept that an iPSC-based platform can be used for AMD drug discovery. This drug screen design was based on calcium signaling defect-induced RPE cell death and it used clinically tested drugs. It allowed us to discover two pre-tested drugs with different mechanism of actions but robust activity in suppressing disease phenotype in CC-HS challenged RPE cells, halting disease progression and restoring tissue functionality. The apparent difference in efficacy of the two drugs on lipid deposits vs APOE deposits may reflect a more dynamic turnover of lipid-only deposits as compared to APOE containing deposits. Furthermore, the similar activity of these two drugs in restoring RPE functionality in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H)-iRPE-as measured by their effects on the NF-\u03baB and autophagy pathways, junctional maturity, and phagocytic ability is critical as it indicates their potential to also affect photoreceptor survival and health. Overall, this data suggests that drugs are strong candidates for testing in patients at or before the RPE atrophy stage of AMD. Furthermore, repurposing of these previously used drugs will allow their faster approval for testing in AMD patients.",
                                "L745, 870 is a known antagonist of Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) 50 . DRD4 is highly expressed in native and iRPE cells, and its expression increases in CC-HS treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 12). Activation of dopamine receptors is associated with similar intracellular processes induced by CC-HS treatment-calcium homeostasis defects, AKT/ERK, and NF-\u03baB activation 51,52 . L745, 870 likely acts by blocking intracellular pathways shared by DRD4 and the two complement receptors, making it an effective drug in ameliorating AMD cellular phenotypes induced by CC-HS. Despite commonality between intracellular signaling for DRD4 and complement receptors, our data support a dominant role for C3aR1 and C5aR1 over DRD4 in inducing AMD cellular phenotypes in iRPE cells because blocking C3aR1 and C5aR1 is sufficient to rescue CC-HS induced TER drop and reduce APOE-positive deposits (Fig. 3i,j). In comparison, ACA is a serine protease inhibitor known for its role to inhibit thrombin proteases 53 . Serine proteases are one of the largest classes of proteases, including most proteases upstream of C3a and C5a generation 54 (e.g., C1s, C1r, C2, CFB, and CFD). We hypothesize that ACA blocks the activity of most of these complement proteases, thus blocking the generation of C3a and C5a. We further extend this hypothesis to suggest that in AMD, locally delivered ACA at an earlier disease stage will block the local generation of C3a and C5a around the RPE/photoreceptor interface, stop RPE atrophy and also stop muller glia activation 55 . Furthermore, our drug analysis suggests that the recently completed phase III clinical trial for an anti-CFD antibody (Lampalizumab) designed to block the formation of C3a and C5a to slow down the progression of GA lesion would have been more effective at an earlier disease stage 4,56 .",
                                "The current model provides an in-depth analysis of complement-induced phenotypic and signaling changes in RPE monolayer and highlights the ability of iRPE cells to autonomously form drusen deposits (Fig. 8a-d). One limitation of our model is that due to the lacking photoreceptor interface, we couldn't replicate sub-retinal drusenoid deposits that share some proteins with sub-RPE drusen deposits 57 . Another limitation is that our model doesn't address the potential disease contribution by the atrophy of the choriocapillaris that may be influenced by other AMD-risk alleles such as in the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus 58 . CC-HS treatment is an acute model for AMD that likely conceals subtle differences between the two CFH genotypes, but this model does extend our current understanding of the role complement proteins play in inducing sub-RPE deposits and RPE atrophy. It highlights the role of activated NF-\u03baB and downregulated autophagy in regulating AMD cellular phenotypes and suggests that drugs inhibiting NK-\u03baB activation and autophagy downregulation may have the potential to work as anti-AMD therapeutics. Furthermore, the ability of two different drugs to inhibit several hallmarks of AMD pathology in both CFH(Y/Y) and CFH(H/H) RPE cells downstream of DRD4 or via complement inhibition further validates the translational relevance of our model. In future, we plan to perform pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of these two drugs with the goal to start a phase I clinical trial testing the tolerability and safety of these two drugs in patients."

                        "Transepithelial resistance, electrophysiology, and calcium recordings. Transepithelial resistance (TER) is a measure of intactness of tight junctions between neighboring cells and reflects mature monolayer tissue. Two different methods were used to measure TER across the iRPE monolayers: (1) using commercially available Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter (EVOM2, WPI); (2) modified Ussing chamber-based electrophysiology 28 . was used.",
                        "(1) EVOM2: The electrodes in the form of chopsticks (STX2, WPI) were applied on the apical and basal sides of iRPE, the current was passed, and resistance values (Ohms) were noted down for each condition. Actual resistance (Ohms.cm2) is calculated by multiplying TER to the area of measurement (12 mm diameter transwell in this case). ( 2) Modified Ussing Chamber: Unlike EVOM2 that can only measure monolayer TER, in our custom electrophysiology set up we can also measure monolayer transepithelial potential (TEP). TEP is the difference in resting membrane potential of apical and basal membranes of an RPE cell. It reflects the differential expression of ion channels on the two membranes. A higher TEP suggests higher functional polarization and a fully mature RPE monolayer. For TEP measurements, iRPE cells seeded on transwell were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. Calomel electrodes were used in Ringer's solutions and Agar bridges to measure the transepithelial potential (TEP) 29 . The signals from intracellular microelectrodes were referenced to the basal bath, to measure the basolateral membrane potential (Vb); while the apical membrane potential (Va) was calculated by the equation: Va = Vb-TEP. The total transepithelial resistance (TER) and the ratio of the apical to basolateral membrane resistance (R a /R b ), were obtained by passing 2-4 mA current pulses across the tissue, and measuring the resultant changes in TEP, Va, and Vb. For the determination of intracellular calcium levels, a ratiometeric dye, Fura-2 (F1221, ThermoFisher) was used. CI-HS and CC-HS treated cells were incubated with 33 \u03bcM FURA2 and 0.007% Pluronic (P3000MP, ThermoFisher Scientific) at RT for an hour. To record change in intracellular Ca 2+ levels in response to ATP a polychrome V monochromator (TILL Photonics; FEI Life Sciences) was used in conjunction with custom software written in LabVIEW to provide highspeed photic excitation between 340 and 385 nm every 0.5 s and a photomultiplier tube measuring the emission fluorescence at 510 nm.",

RNA-Seq libraries were constructed from 1 \u00b5g total RNA using the Illumina TruSeq \u00ae RNA Sample Prep Kits, version 2 which includes poly-A enrichment. After second-strand synthesis, the cDNA was fragmented using the Covaris E210 (26593, American Laboratory Trading). Library amplification was performed using ten cycles to minimize the risk of over-amplification. Unique single-index barcode adapters were applied to each library. Libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio and sequenced together on a HiSeq 4000. At least 46 million 75base read pairs were generated for each individual library. Data were processed using RTA 2.7.7 and CASAVA 1.8.2. Gene-and transcript-level expression was quantified with quasi-mapping (Salmon) and differential expression was calculated with DESeq2. The Salmon tool (with the-seqBias and-gcBias corrections applied) was used to quantify transcript expression using Gencode (version 27). The transcript-level quantification was collapsed to the gene level with the tximport tool in R (3). The gene differential expression analysis was conducted with the DESeq2 tool, where we removed the batch effects from cell line-specific variation by setting it as a covariate.
