    "abstract": "A method and system for three dimensional crystallographic grain orientation mapping illuminates a polycrystalline sample with a broadband x-ray beam derived from a laboratory x-ray source, detects, on one or more x-ray detectors, diffracted beams from the sample, and processes data from said diffracted beams with the sample in different rotation positions to generate three dimensional reconstructions of grain orientation, position, and/or 3-D volume. A specific, cone beam, geometry leverages the fact that for a point x-ray source with a divergent beam on reflection of an extended crystal grain diffracts x-rays such that they are focused in the diffraction plane direction.",

                        "Metals, ceramics and other important materials are composed of many individual single crystal grains. For homogenous composition materials, the crystal structure of all grains is identical, but their relative crystal orientation is not identical throughout the material. In fact many important engineering properties of materials are a function of the grain properties, such as grain size, boundaries, size distribution, and orientation, to list a few examples.",
                        "Single composition poly-crystalline materials typically have no contrast to identify individual grains and boundaries in conventional x-ray tomography scans based on absorption and/or phase contrast.",
                        "Electron backscatter diffraction imaging (EBSD) can be performed on the surface of polished cross-sections of materials in a scanning electron microscope to image grains and grain boundaries in two dimensions. The crystal orientation of grains is determined in EBSD. Serial sectioning with a focused ion beam milling tool and EBSD imaging can yield three dimensional (3-D) EBSD data. 3-D EBSD is a destructive measurement technique since the sample gets destroyed in the process, however.",
                        "Material evolution in the time domain as a function of external factors such as temperature cycling, stress or strain are extremely important to understand material failure and best processing conditions to yield materials with optimum properties. Since 3-D EBSD can only capture the grain map of a sample once, it is very unsatisfactory to study material evolution.",
                        "X-ray diffraction contrast tomography (x-ray DCT) is a non-destructive approach for obtaining the 3-dimensional characterization of polycrystalline microstructures. It allows the simultaneous mapping of the crystal grain shapes, grain orientation and microstructure of polycrystals that gives rise to absorption.",
                        "In the conventional x-ray DCT arrangement, the sample is illuminated with a monochromatic beam of high energy synchrotron radiation. As the sample is rotated, and grains pass through the illuminating beam, the condition for Bragg diffraction gets fulfilled by individual grains, these diffraction spots are recorded on a 2D detector placed behind the sample. The diffraction geometry is used to assign spots to the grains from which they arise, and to determine the crystallographic orientations of grains. The spots are used as projections of the grains to reconstruct the respective grain shapes. The technique has been applied to several materials science investigations, for example in the 3D characterization of grain boundary networks, and in-situ studies of inter-granular stress corrosion cracking in some stainless steels. Other materials investigated by x-ray DCT have included aluminum alloy Al 1050. Most importantly, it is now possible to perform routine 3-D grain map measurements non-destructively, which enables repetitive measurements to study time evolution.",
                        "The necessity to use synchrotron sources to perform these measurements is very limiting and a laboratory source diffraction CT system would close this gap. It is well known that synchrotrons generate x-rays with orders of magnitude higher brightness than laboratory sources, and the methods for DCT developed for the synchrotron require high beam brightness, which manifests itself in high beam collimation and monochromaticity.",
                        "Laboratory sources generally have very poor brightness compared to synchrotrons since they emit a very wide bandwidth of x-ray wavelengths in terms of Bremsstrahlung. Characteristic emission lines emitted in addition to the Bremsstrahlung background are low in intensity compared to total x-ray power emitted, and the use of a monochromator (crystal monochromator or multilayer) further reduces the intensity when trying to monochromatize the beam of a laboratory source.",
                        "Nevertheless, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0008736A1, to Lauridsen et al., published on Jan. 12, 2012, describes an x-ray DCT system that can use a laboratory source. This system mirrors the implementation of a synchrotron DCT setup, in that it assumes the use of a focused and monochromatic x-ray beam. Additionally a scheme using non-standard detectors is described to detect the diffracted signal."

In particular, a need exists for techniques that make it possible to use x-ray DCT in research and industrial facilities that do not have a synchrotron radiation source. Also particularly needed are arrangements that utilize simple and effective detection systems.",
                        "In general, according to one aspect, the invention features a method for three dimensional crystallographic grain orientation mapping. In the method, a rotating sample is illuminated by a broadband, cone x-ray beam derived from a laboratory x-ray source, to generate, on an x-ray detector, a diffracted beam image. Data from the image coupled with information regarding an angle of sample rotation are processed (e.g., by a controller) to obtain three dimensional reconstructions of grain orientation and position.",

The apparatus includes a laboratory x-ray source, one or more optional x-ray conditioning devices such as apertures for restricting the extent of the cone beam from the source, a stage for rotating the sample, a single detection system, preferably a high resolution pixilated x-ray detector, for collecting diffraction data, and a controller for processing data received by the detector, coupled with information regarding an angle of sample rotation, to generate three dimensional reconstructions of grain orientation and position.",
                        "Utilizing the apparatus and techniques described herein, crystallographic mapping using x-ray DCT principles can be performed in the laboratory with one of the primary advantages of the present system being its compact size. Compared with the synchrotron x-ray sources typically needed in traditional x-ray DCT experiments, the laboratory x-ray source used here is small, much less expensive, and allows constant access. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches, a broadband, unfocused (cone) x-ray beam is used that more efficiently utilizes the x-rays produced by a standard laboratory source.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The current embodiment generally relates to a method and apparatus for obtaining three dimensional crystallographic grain orientation mapping. In contrast to previously described approaches, the system, and corresponding method, uses a laboratory x-ray source and a detection system, which is able to detect the x-rays transmitted through and diffracted by the sample at preferably at least two distances from the sample in a conebeam geometry. Preferably, a high resolution pixilated x-ray detector is used to collect diffracted x-rays and generate diffraction data. A lower resolution detector is used to detect the diffracted x-rays and projection images through the sample in the projection plane.",
                        "During operation, the sample being studied is rotated utilizing, for instance, a motion stage system with an angle of rotation (A), to produce a series of angular projections. A controller receives image data of multiple images from the detection system (obtained while rotating the sample) and performs three dimensional reconstructions of grain orientation and position.",
                        "Preferably, the system uses a \u201cwhite\u201d or broadband beam of x-ray radiation, i.e., a beam with a wide wavelength spectrum. The bandwidth of the x-ray beam is only restricted by the operating voltage of the x-ray source and optional absorption filters in the beam.",
                        "It is well known that a broadband (white) x-ray beam gives rise to diffraction patterns. For a single crystal/grain, this is referred to Laue diffraction patterns. Diffraction reflections manifest themselves at specific angles corresponding to 1) the d-spacing of the crystal planes, 2) the orientation of the planes and 3) one specific x-ray energy or narrow range of x-ray energy that is selected from the incoming broad-band x-ray spectrum to fulfill the Bragg condition for reflection.",
                        "In polychromatic diffraction, each reflection off the crystal \u201cselects\u201d a specific wavelength or narrowband from the incident wavelength spectrum. Generally many reflections of one crystal grain are present in a single diffraction pattern corresponding to various crystal plane d-spacings, diffraction angles and x-ray wavelengths obeying the Bragg condition 2d*sin(\u03b2)=lambda, (or: 2d\u00b7sin \u03b2=\u03bb), where d is the lattice spacing, beta (\u03b2) the diffraction angle and lambda (\u03bb) the wavelength.",
                        "For a single crystal material, a system controller analyzes these diffraction patterns and the images detected by the detector system and extracts crystal orientation and lattice spacing from the data.",
                        "In a polycrystalline material that has many grains illuminated by the x-ray beam, each grain will contribute many reflections to the diffraction patterns. The polychromatic diffraction pattern of a polycrystalline sample using a collimated (parallel) incident x-ray beam in general leads to a superposition of many diffraction spots for which it is not possible to decipher crystal grain association, wavelength and d-spacing. In fact, if a large number of grains are present, the random orientation of the individual grains will give rise to so called Laue diffraction rings, which are well known in a diffraction method called powder diffraction. Powder diffraction is an established method to determine the crystal structure of a material, but does not reveal any specific grain information.",
                        "In contrast, the present system uses a specific (cone beam) geometry that leverages the fact that for a point x-ray source with a divergent beam on reflection of an extended crystal grain diffracts x-rays such that they are focused in the diffraction plane direction to a distance equal to the source-sample distance dss. We call this special plane the Laue focusing plane. This focusing effect is caused by the single crystal grain \u201cseeing\u201d the x-ray source under different incidence angles over the extent of the crystal grain, which then selects different wavelengths and diffraction angles for the reflection according to the aforementioned Bragg's law.",
                        "Different from collimated (parallel) beam polychromatic diffraction, the wavelength of the reflected x-rays is not constant across one grain in the present system, but varies dependent on the position within the grain where the x-rays strike.",
                        "FIG. 1 illustrates the Laue focal plane 50 and the projection plane 52.",
                        "In more detail, a broadband source 110 emits a diverging beam of broadband radiation 115. This radiation is diffracted by a crystal or grain within the sample 10.",
                        "The diffraction effect by the crystal 10 yields the Laue focal plane 50 where the x-rays that meet the Bragg condition are focused by the diffraction in the crystal or grain 10 of the sample. Since the focusing only occurs in the diffraction plane, in general the pattern of the diffracted beam will form a line in the Laue focal plane. It is also noted that the distances between source and sample (dss) and between sample and the Laue focal plane (dsd1) are equal. Then, at a further distance from the sample 10, the projection plane 52 is found from the projection of the diffracting crystal or grain. The distance of the projection plane from the Laue focal plane is arbitrary and depends on the pixel size of the x-ray detector available to record the pattern in the projection plane.",
                        "FIG. 2A is a top view showing the relevant distances when a broadband diverging beam is diffracted by a sample crystal grain. Specifically, the distance between the source 110 and the sample 10 is dss. The distance between the sample 10 and the Laue focal plane 50 is dsd1 and the distance between the sample 10 and the projection plane 52 is dsd2.",
                        "Of interest is the fact that different wavelengths or energies within the x-ray beam 115 meet the Bragg condition along different portions of the sample crystal or grain 10. Thus, the features generated at the Laue focal plane 50 are combination of multiple wavelengths, \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3. These wavelengths are within the spectral band \u03bbmin to \u03bbmax contained within the broadband x-rays emitted by the source 110.",
                        "An aperture 112 is used between the source 110 and the sample 10 to restrict the illumination beam on the sample and separate the direct transmitted beam/non-diffracted beam 62, from the diffracted beam 60, 64.",
                        "Since the diffracted beam 60, 64 is focused in the Laue plane, the projected image of the crystal in the projection plane is inverted and has a geometrical magnification that is given by (dsd2\u2212dss)/dss, and can also appear sheared.",
                        "FIG. 2B is a top view showing the relevant distances when a broadband diverging beam is diffracted by a sample crystal grain. The focusing effect at the Laue focal plane 50 leads to the formation of line-shaped spots.",
                        "The appearance of the diffracted signals as line-shaped spots in the Laue focal plane comes from a focusing effect and a magnification effect. One such line shaped spot originates from the diffraction of X-rays off one set of planes within one crystal grain of the sample. The crystal planes within the grain diffract and focus the X-rays along their normal direction to a narrow line. This focusing effect occurs across the whole length of the crystal grain, which means that the length of the line shaped spot in the Laue focal plane is a projected representation of the diffracting grain's physical size in this direction magnified by a factor of (dss+dsd1)/dss, which is equal to 2. The grain is projected non-inverted in this direction. From this it becomes clear that in order to be able to resolve crystal dimensions in the Laue focal plane a high-resolution detector will be required, which is able to resolve the grain dimensions since the geometric magnification is very low and equal to two. The magnification of the projection of the grain in the projection plane is given by (dss+dsd2)/dss which is identical to projection x-ray imaging systems. The larger geometrical magnification in the projection plane enables the use of lower resolution x-ray detector systems.",
                        "For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3A, a spatially resolved x-ray detector 150 located at the Laue focal plane 50 detects the lines 60 that encode the orientation of the plane of the reflection. The lines 60 at the Laue focal plane 50 are adjacent to any x-rays that form the direct beam 62 that are not diffracted by the sample 10.",
                        "As illustrated in FIG. 3B, a spatially resolved x-ray detector 152 located at the projection plane 52 detects reflected x-rays 64 onto a projection plane detector 152 that give rise to a projection of the diffracting grain.",
                        "In the projection plane, the magnification of the projection of the grain is not equal in the diffraction and orthogonal plane. In the diffraction plane the projection is inverted and has a lower magnification than in the orthogonal plane. In the orthogonal plane, the projection is non-inverted.",
                        "One strategy to obtain a re-projection of the grain outline into the sample plane for the reconstruction of a 3-D grain map is to re-project the grain shape from the projection plane through the line focus in the Laue focal plane 52. This allows for the identification of the index and wavelength giving rise to the reflection, knowing the geometry of the setup (source position) along with inferences as to the exact grain location within the sample.",
                        "The identification of Friedel pairs in the diffraction data aids in the identification of diffraction signals belonging to the same grain.",
                        "Shown in FIG. 4 is one example of an apparatus for conducting x-ray three dimensional crystallographic grain orientation mapping according to embodiments of the invention. The apparatus generally includes the x-ray source 110, for illuminating sample 10.",
                        "The source 110 is a \u201claboratory x-ray source\u201d. It is preferably located on a source z-axis stage that enables independent adjustment of source to sample distance (dss). As used herein, a \u201claboratory x-ray source\u201d is any suitable source of x-rays that is not a synchrotron x-ray radiation source.",
                        "Source 110 can be an X-ray tube, in which electrons are accelerated in a vacuum by an electric field and shot into a target piece of metal, with x-rays being emitted as the electrons decelerate in the metal. Typically, such sources produce a continuous spectrum of background x-rays combined with sharp peaks in intensity at certain energies that derive from the characteristic lines of the selected target, depending on the type of metal target used. Furthermore, the x-ray beams are divergent and lack spatial and temporal coherence.",
                        "In one example, source 110 is a rotating anode type or microfocused source, with a Tungsten target. Targets that include Molybdenum, Gold, Platinum, Silver or Copper also can be employed. Preferably a transmission configuration is used in which the electron beam strikes the thin target 410 from its backside. The x-rays emitted from the other side of the target are used as the beam 115.",
                        "In another, more specific example, source 110 is a structured anode x-ray source such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,443,953 issued to Yun, et al. on Oct. 28, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In this case, the source has a thin top layer made of the desired target material and a thicker bottom layer made of low atomic number and low density materials with good thermal properties. The anode can include, for instance, a layer of copper with an optimal thickness deposited on a layer of beryllium or diamond substrate.",
                        "X-ray lasers producing radiation having an energy suitable for the tomographic applications described herein also can be employed.",
                        "In still another example, the source 110 is a metal jet x-ray source such as are available from Excillum AB, Kista, Sweden. This type of source uses microfocus tubes in which the anode is a liquid-metal jet. Thus, the anode is continuously regenerated and already molten.",
                        "The x-ray beam 115 generated by source 110 is preferably conditioned to suppress unwanted energies or wavelengths of radiation. For example, undesired wavelengths present in the beam are eliminated or attenuated, using, for instance, an energy filter 412 (designed to select a desired x-ray wavelength range (bandwidth)). Nevertheless, the filter 412 does not substantially reduce the total energy or bandwidth of the transmitted beam 115. For example, the filter 412 preferably decreases the power in the beam by no greater than 50%. In the preferred embodiment, it decreases the power in the beam by no greater than 30%. The relevance is that most of the broadband x-rays generated by the x-ray source 110 are preserved to illuminate the sample 10. In general the bandwidth of the x-rays used are greater than 40% as defined by the ratio of the central x-ray energy to the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the x-ray energy band. E.g. for a central energy of 50 keV an energy band of at least 20 keV around the central energy is used. In general the bandwidth is at least 20%, since otherwise the available flux of the source is cut too severely. It is also recognized that by collecting data with various x-ray source/filter combinations, the central energy and bandwidth are varied in some examples. This provides additional information in the data that can be used by the control system 105 to identify the wavelength range of recorded reflections.",
                        "The beam extent is preferably reduced by passing the x-ray beam through aperture device 112, having a beam defining pinhole or appropriate square aperture. This aperture limits the illuminated region on the sample 10 and restricts the size of the direct beam on the x-ray detection system. It is recognized that by using different size apertures the number of crystal grains within the beam can be adjusted, which is advantageous to keep the number of diffraction reflections manageable and reduce overlap of reflections. In general, every grain will already have several reflections recorded in the Laue and projection planes.",
                        "More than one energy filter 412 and/or aperture device 112 are employed in other implementations. On the other hand, this beam conditioning is omitted in cases in which the laboratory source (e.g., a laser) generates an adequately bandlimited and/or spatially limited beam.",
                        "The x-ray beam 115 derived (either directly, i.e., without further conditioning, for example in the case of a laser source, or conditioned as described above) from the laboratory x-ray source 110 illuminates sample 10, the sample being studied. Often, the sample 10 is a polycrystalline material having many crystal grains in which each grain constitutes a crystal with translational symmetry. While the grains can have the same chemical composition and lattice structure, they generally have different orientations.",
                        "Examples of materials that can be analyzed using the apparatus and techniques described herein include but are not limited to metals, metal alloys, ceramics, and so forth.",
                        "The region of interest of the sample 10 is located in the beam using the x, y, z axis translatory capability of the sample stage 414. The sample 10 is then rotated (see angle \u03b8) around the y axis exposing different sample faces to the incoming x-ray beam 115. In specific examples, the sample 110 is held in a sample holder mounted on a stage 414 (not shown) which allows rotation and, in preferred implementations, translation of the sample in relation to the x-ray beam 115 to allow for alignment.",
                        "For instance, the sample 10 can be manipulated using a conventional system, which includes a sample holder and a stage system, ideally motorized, for adjusting and rotating the sample 10. The stage 414 may be designed for translation along (z-axis) and/or in the transverse directions (y and x axes) of the x-ray beam 115 illuminating the sample 10, in the plane of the optical table (x-axis) and/or in a direction vertical to it (y-axis). For convenience, the coordinate system used herein has as the z-axis the axis along optical path defined by the incoming x-ray beam; the x-axis as perpendicular to the incoming x-ray beam 115 (in the plane of the optical table); and the y-axis as projecting in a direction perpendicular (vertical) with respect to the (horizontal) plane of the optical table.",

The stage 414 can rotate sample 10 about rotational axis y (see angle \u03b8 in FIG. 4) either with a predefined, settable rotational speed such as in the range from 20 minutes to 24 hours per full rotation of 360\u00b0 or in stepwise, incremental rotational movements that may be set such as in the range from 0.01\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 per incremental rotation. The stage can have a default reference point for the rotational position of 0\u00b0 and can provide an option for setting an actual reference point at initiation of the rotational movement of a mounted sample. The rotational angle of the stage with respect to the reference point is communicated from the sample staging device 414 to the system controller 105.",

The advantage of blocking the direct beam using the x-ray stop 418 is that the direct beam carries little information about the grain structure of the sample 10.

Preferably, also the controller 105 operates the stages 422, 424 of the Laue plane detector 150 and the projection plane detector 152.

M. Lauridsen et al., published on Jan. 12, 2012 (Appendix D).",

Cryst. 41, 302-309) x-ray DCT has some similarities to conventional X-ray absorption contrast tomography. Typically, grains in the sample are imaged using the occasionally occurring diffraction contribution to the X-ray attenuation coefficient each time a grain fulfils the diffraction condition. The three-dimensional grain shapes are reconstructed from a limited number of projections using an algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). Algorithms based on scanning orientation space and aiming at determining the corresponding crystallographic grain orientations also have been developed.",
                        "By simultaneous acquisition of the transmitted and the diffracted beams, the technique described by Ludwig, et al. (2008). J. Appl. Cryst. 41, 302-309 has been extended (see, e.g., G. Johnson et al., J. Appl. Cryst. (2008) V41, pp. 310-318) to the study of underformed polycrystalline samples containing more than 100 grains per cross section. Here, the grains are still imaged using the occasionally occurring diffraction contribution to the X-ray attenuation coefficient (which can be observed as a reduction in the intensity of the transmitted or direct beam 62 when a grain fulfils the diffraction condition). The segmentation of the extinction spot images with the additional diffracted beam information has been automated even in the presence of significant spot overlap. By pairing the corresponding direct (\u2018extinction\u2019) and diffracted beam spots a robust sorting and indexing approach has been developed.",

This effect can be used to eliminate the need for continuous rotation (theta) of the sample 10. Additionally, the line geometry of the diffraction spots in the Laue plane reduces the \u201coverlap\u201d problem since the lines can be separated more easily than large spots, which are detected with traditional systems.",

If a synchrotron beam would be conditioned to deliver a diverging broadband beam to a polycrystalline sample, the same methods as described above can be employed potentially offering significant performance advantages over the currently used methods, which use a monochromatic beam. In fact, underutilized, low-brightness bending magnet beamlines at synchrotrons could be used instead of a laboratory source to provide the broadband, divergent x-ray beam."
