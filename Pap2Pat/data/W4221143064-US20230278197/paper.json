    "abstract": "This paper presents a chance-constrained formulation for robust trajectory optimization during manipulation. In particular, we present a chance-constrained optimization for Stochastic Discrete-time Linear Complementarity Systems (SDLCS). To solve the optimization problem, we formulate Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming with Chance Constraints (MIQPCC). In our formulation, we explicitly consider joint chance constraints for complementarity as well as states to capture the stochastic evolution of dynamics. We evaluate robustness of our optimized trajectories in simulation on several systems. The proposed approach outperforms some recent approaches for robust trajectory optimization for SDLCS.",

                "Contacts are central to manipulation problems. Consequently, contact modeling has been an active area of research in robotics since the last several decades [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. One of the most popular approaches to model contact dynamics is using Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). LCP models are widely used for modeling contact dynamics in academia as well as in several physics simulation engines such as Bullet, ODE, etc. Trajectory optimization (TO) of LCP-based contact models has been used for manipulation [6], [7] and legged locomotion [8]. Lyapunov stability of linear systems with complementarity systems has also been studied [9], [10], [11]. However, most of these works assume deterministic contact models to perform TO. In reality, frictional interaction systems suffer from several uncertainties which lead to stochastic dynamics and thus, it is important to consider uncertainty during TO. Modeling uncertainty in LCP-based contact models leads to Stochastic Discrete-time Linear Complementarity System (SDLCS).",
                "Fig. 1 pictorially shows a SDLCS we study in this paper. We consider the SDLCS that has uncertainty in parameters and additive noises in dynamics and complementarity constraints. As shown in Fig. 1, one should notice that uncertainty leads to stochastic evolution of system states in SDLCS. Thus, a robust optimization formulation should consider the uncertainty in state evolution. In some recent works that consider stochastic complementarity constraints, an expected residual minimization (ERM)-based [12] penalty is used to solve the robust optimization problem [13]. A major shortcoming of such an approach is that it fails to capture the stochastic evolution of system dynamics due to the Fig. 1: This paper presents chance-constrained optimization for SDLCS. The figure shows the case of a sliding box on a plane where the coefficient of friction is a Gaussian random variable. Note that w and v are additive uncertainty terms. stochastic complementarity constraint. In [14], the authors augment the formulation in [13] with chance constraints. However, this formulation has certain fundamental shortcomings which prevent constraint satisfaction guarantees. We present a formulation that circumvents these shortcomings by using a mixed integer formulation. Using some relaxation of the original joint chance complementarity constraint problem for the SDLCS, the resulting problem can be solved using mixed integer programming.",
                "In this paper, we present a formulation of robust trajectory optimization for SDLCS. Since worst-case robust optimization is quite conservative and does not explicitly discuss stochastic evolution of states [15], this work considers probabilistic optimization with stochastic evolution of states. Robustness to uncertainty is provided by enforcing probabilistic satisfaction of state constraints. Under certain simplifications, we show that the chance-constrained problem can be reformulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program with Chance Constraints.",
                "Contributions. This paper has the following contributions: 1) We present a novel formulation for chance-constrained optimization of SDLCS. 2) We compare our proposed approach with several previously proposed techniques and demonstrate that our method outperforms the recent techniques in [13], [14]. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several manipulation systems with linear dynamics."

                "In this section, we review some of the work which is most close to the work presented in this paper. Our work is closely related to TO techniques for contact-rich systems.",
                "Contact-implicit TO techniques are becoming very popular for performing TO for contact-rich systems, and several techniques have been proposed for manipulation as well as legged locomotion [6], [8], [16]. All the above techniques assume perfect model knowledge and do not consider uncertainty.",
                "There has been some recent work on robust TO in SNCS [13], [14], [17]. In [13], the authors have utilized the formulation of ERM for robust TO. ERM, first introduced in [12] for Stochastic Linear Complementarity Problem (SLCP), aims at minimizing the expected error in satisfying the SLCP. In [13], authors use ERM as an additional penalty term in their TO problem. However, such a formulation does not consider the stochastic state evolution of the system during optimization. A chance-constrained formulation for SNCS is presented in [14]. This method augments the ERMaugmented objective in [13] with additional chance constraints on satisfying the complementarity constraints. The formulation ignores the stochastic evolution of system state during optimization, and thus borrows the limitations of [13]. Furthermore, this formulation is incapable of enforcing a constraint violation probability smaller than 0.5 for any degree of uncertainty. Consequently, this method is very fragile for trajectories with the horizon, N > 1 as the chance of violating the constraints for such trajectories is 0.5N \u2265 1 [18]. Our formulation addresses these weaknesses under certain simplifying assumptions for SDLCS.",
                "Another line of work which is relevant to understand some of our proposed work is related to chance-constrained optimization (CCO). This has been extensively studied in robotics as well as optimization literature [19], [20], [21]. In [19], authors have proposed stochastic optimization formulation for open-loop collision avoidance problems using chance constraints under Gaussian noise. [21] uses statistical moments of the distribution to handle non-Gaussian chance constraints. An important point to note here is that in all CC formulation for dynamic optimization, one needs to consider the CDF function for the joint probability distribution of all variables. However, such distribution is generally extremely challenging to compute. Thus, in general, the joint chance constraint is decomposed into individual chance constraints using Boole's inequality (see [19], [21]), which results in very conservative approximation of the individual constraints. Our formulation utilizes Boole's inequality to convert the original computationally intractable joint chance constraints into conservative but tractable independent chance constraints."

Note that we represent the chance constraints on all the variables jointly (as is common in stochastic optimization for dynamic systems) using the cdf for the state as well as complementarity variables.

                        "The optimized control and state trajectories for the three systems using our proposed method are shown in Fig. 4-Fig. 6. Overall, these figures show that the planner generates state trajectories that are farther away from the bound specified in the chance constraints as the violation probability decreases. For instance, Fig. 4 shows that the trajectories are farther away from x = 0.05 as \u2206 decreases. In addition, the trajectory with \u2206 = 0.02 reaches its maximum value Fig. 4: State and control trajectories with different \u2206 for the cartpole example. First, the cart moves in the negative direction to utilize the contact force \u03bb 2 because the control input is bounded. Once the cart obtains enough \u03bb 2 , the cart is accelerated to the positive direction. We can observe the effect of our proposed chance constraints in particular around t \u2208 [0, 0.1] and t \u2208 [0.4, 0.5]. When t \u2208 [0, 0.1], the mode changes from the \"contact on the wall 2\" to the \"no contact\" and the cart tries to be far from wall 2 to satisfy the CCC. When t \u2208 [0.4, 0.5], the trajectories are farther away from x 1 = 0.05 and x 2 = 0.15 as \u2206 decreases.",

In addition, these figures illustrate that the control costs increase as \u2206 decreases. This illustrates the trade-off relation between safety and cost.",
                        "At this point, we would like to discuss the magnitude of uncertainty we consider in these problems. Compared to some other stochastic optimal control works [19], [20], the uncertainty in these problems is relatively smaller. There are several reasons why we need to have a smaller uncertainty. Note that as we have explained in Sec III, our approach satisfies joint constraints on multiple constraints together. First, our formulation has chance complementarity constraints in addition to chance constraints on states, which are commonly used. Our formulation has more number of chance constraints, and consequently, the lower uncertainty is required because of the conservative approximation of Boole's inequality to resolve joint chance constraints into individual constraints as explained in Sec IV-A, Sec IV-B. Second, we need to have a small \u01eb to avoid large violation of complementarity constraints, which requires small uncertainty. Finally, we would like to emphasize that allowing larger uncertainties requires either better resolution of joint chance constraints or covariance steering approaches [20], which is out of scope for the current study."

We run the ERM method in [13] with different weighting \u03b2 and the CCC [14] with violation probability \u2206 z = 0.5. \u03b2 was chosen so that the magnitude of the ERM cost is a similar order of other costs. For a fair comparison, we regard that the constraints are violated if the chance constraints are not satisfied in our method. We regard Fig. 5: State and control trajectories with different \u2206 for a sliding box with friction. First, the box is accelerated in the positive direction. Then, the control decreases with time to regulate the box around the origin by employing the friction forces. We can observe the effect of our proposed chance constraints in particular around t \u2208 [0.2, 0.3] where the trajectories are farther away from x 1 = 0.88 as \u2206 decreases. Fig. 6: Time history of x 1 with different maximum violation probabilities \u2206 for dual manipulation. First, the box is pushed by the right arm in the negative direction.

In contrast, the control sequences based on the ERM method in [13] show 100% violation probabilities with \u03b2 = 10 4 , 10 5 , which are much worse than the obtained violation probabilities using our proposed method. With \u03b2 = 10 3 , we got a relatively good violation probability. The CCC in [14] could also show the relatively good violation probability compared to the ERM-based method with \u03b2 = 10 4 , 10 5 but shows the worse violation probability compared to our method with \u2206 = 0.5 and the ERM with \u03b2 = 10 3 . Thus, we confirm that our proposed approach satisfies chance constraints in the simulator in this example.",
                        "Table II shows that empirically obtained violation probabilities are lower than the specified violation probabilities used in our proposed optimization like the cartpole example, except for the cases with \u2206 = 0.01, 0.002. There are several factors that contribute to the violation of the chance constraints. Unlike the cartpole example, F is not a P matrix so we can get the multiple solutions in \u03bb, which can lead to non-Gaussian distributions. Also, even though \u01eb is small, it  [13], and the CCC in [14] with \u2206z = 0.5, and obtained \u2206 from the simulation of \"cartpole with softwalls\" over 1000 samples.

While we can ignore these effects with relatively large \u2206, we cannot ignore these effects anymore with the small \u2206. Although the planner could not satisfy the chance constraints for all \u2206 in this example, our method achieves much lower violation probabilities compared to the ERM in [13] and the CCC in [14]. Table III shows that we have the same discussion for the dual manipulators example as for the pushing a box example. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that our proposed planner could successfully drive the system to the goal state. We also observe that with decreasing \u2206, the system trajectories move further away from state set boundaries to satisfy tighter chance constraints. For Fig. 9, while the majority of the sampled trajectories converge to the specified terminal constraints, some of them clearly converged to other states. This result also shows that the true distribution of the uncertainty for the dynamics systems with LCS is not Gaussian."
