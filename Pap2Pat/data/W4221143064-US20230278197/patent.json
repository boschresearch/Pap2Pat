                        "Contacts play a central role in all robotic manipulation tasks. While selective use of contacts can allow robots to reason about and manipulate their environment, contact-based reasoning and control tend to be challenging in every aspect. Contact models are challenging from analytical, algorithmic as well as computational aspects. As a result, very little progress has been made in principled techniques for model-based manipulation. The underlying hybrid dynamics of frictional interaction as well as uncertainty associated with frictional parameters makes efficient design of model-based controllers for manipulation challenging.",
                        "Contact modeling has been an active area of research in robotics since the last several decades. One of the most popular approaches to model contact dynamics is using linear complementarity problem (LCP). LCP models are widely used for modeling contact dynamics in academia as well as several physics simulation engines such as Bullet, ODE, Havok, and the like. The LCP-based contact models have been widely used for solving trajectory optimization problems in manipulation as well as legged locomotion. These works assume deterministic contact models to perform trajectory optimization. However, most frictional interaction systems suffer from several sources which lead to stochastic dynamics. Thus, it is important to consider uncertainty during trajectory optimization. The uncertainty in LCP-based contact models lead to stochastic complementarity constraints during optimization. The stochastic complementarity constraints tend to cause infeasibility in the underlying optimization problem.",

Thus, it is important to consider uncertainty during trajectory optimization (TO) using contact modeling of the frictional interaction systems. Modeling uncertainty in LCP-based contact models leads to Stochastic Discrete-time Complementarity System (SDLCS).",
                        "Some embodiments are based on the recognition that during optimization of the SDLCS, the effect of uncertainty on the evolution of system states should be considered to perform robust optimization of system trajectory. In absence of such a method, a robotic manipulator of a robotic system manipulating the state of the object will suffer from poor performance and the resulting robotic manipulation system could possibly fail. Currently, there are no known techniques that can perform robust optimization for dynamics models with contact dynamics which are modeled as linear complementarity systems. This makes optimization and control of robotic manipulation unreliable and difficult.",
                        "To that end, the present disclosure proposes a chance constrained optimization formulation of SDLCS for robust trajectory optimization during manipulation. To solve the optimization problem, a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming with Chance Constraints (MIQPCC) is formulated. The formulation considers joint chance constraints for complementarity as well as states to capture the stochastic evolution of dynamics.",

                        "Some embodiments are based on the realization that robust trajectory optimization requires chance constraints to be imposed as hard constraints on the SDLCS. However, using the hard constraints on the SDLCS make robust trajectory optimization problem difficult to solve. To that end, one approach is to convert the hard constraints into soft constraints. The hard constraints can be converted into soft constraints by including the hard constraints into a cost function to be optimized to obtain robust trajectories to manipulate the object. Further, the SDLCS with soft constraints is subjected to expected residual minimization (ERM)-based penalty to solve the trajectory optimization problem to obtain optimized trajectories. However, the optimized trajectories obtained with soft constraints and ERM-based penalty on the SDLCS are less robust. Because a formulation of this approach does not consider the stochastic state evolution of the system during optimization.",
                        "Therefore, the robotic system of the present disclosure solves the trajectory optimization problem by imposing chance constraints as hard constraints on the SDLCS. To that end, the chance constrains are divided into two modes by relaxing the chance constraints so that violation of the chance constraints is within acceptable range. In this way, the SDLCS with hard chance constraints is optimized to obtain robust trajectories to manipulate the object.",
