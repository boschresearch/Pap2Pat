                        "Borreliosis is caused by two groups of Borrelia, the B. borgdorferi group and the Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever (TBRF) Borrelia group. It was believed that the B. borgdorferi group was the only group that caused Lyme-like symptoms in infected subjects. However, it has been learned that TBRF Borrelia also causes Lyme-like symptoms. TBRF Borrelia is transmitted by hard (Ixodes) and soft (Ornithodorus) ticks.",
                        "Borrelia bacteria that cause TBRF are typically transmitted to humans through the bite of infected \u201csoft ticks\u201d of the genus Ornithodorus. Soft ticks differ in two important ways from the more familiar \u201chard ticks\u201d (e.g., the dog tick and the deer tick). First, the bite of soft ticks is brief, usually lasting less than half an hour. Second, soft ticks do not search for prey in tall grass or brush. Instead, they live within rodent burrows, feeding as needed on the rodent (for example, squirrels, chipmunks and prairie dogs) as it sleeps.",
                        "The main symptoms of TBRF are high fever (e.g., 103\u00b0 F.), headache, muscle and joint aches. Symptoms can reoccur, producing a telltale pattern of fever lasting roughly 3 days, followed by 7 days without fever, followed by another 3 days of fever. Without antibiotic treatment, this process can repeat several times.",
                        "Humans typically come into contact with soft ticks when they sleep in rodent-infested cabins. The ticks emerge at night and feed briefly while the person is sleeping. The bites are painless, and most people are unaware that they have been bitten. Between meals, the ticks may return to the nesting materials in their host burrows.",
                        "There are several Borrelia species that cause TBRF, and these are usually associated with specific species of ticks. For instance, B. hermsii is transmitted by O. hermsi ticks, B. parkerii by O. parkeri ticks, and B. turicatae by O. turicata ticks. Each tick species has a preferred habitat and preferred set of hosts.",
                        "Soft ticks can live up to 10 years. Individual ticks will take many blood meals during each stage of their life cycle, and some species can pass the infection along through their eggs to their offspring. The long life span of soft ticks means that once a cabin or homestead is infested, it may remain infested unless steps are taken to find and remove the rodent nest.",
                        "Since TBRF can be caused by several species of Borrelia, tests need to be comprehensive by including all known species. Also, identification of the Borrelia species can aid in identifying the host rodent for eradication. Currently, the standard for identification is by identification of TBRF spirochetes in blood smears of a subject presenting symptoms consistent with TBRF. After obtaining the blood draw the sample must be cultured for at least 24 hours to facilitate identification. However, even early in the disease when spirochetes are highest, positive identification is only made about 70% of the time. (See, www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/clinicians/index.html). Thus, prior art materials and methods result in a delay in diagnosis and provide a relatively low level of sensitivity and specificity.",
                        "Therefore, what is needed are new materials and methods suitable for the identification of TBRF causative agents with decreased assay time and increased sensitivity and specificity."

M. Ausubel, Ed., all John Wiley & Sons, N.Y., edition as of 2008; and, Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, 2001, and as is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.

Specificity for said amino acid sequence, i.e., antibody specificity, is the property of antibodies which enables them to react preferentially with some antigenic determinants and not with others. Specificity is dependent on chemical composition, physical forces and molecular structure at the binding site. Sensitivity is how strongly the antibody binds to the antigenic determinant. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine specificity and sensitivity of an antibody for a particular amino acid sequence using standard affinity assays, such as immunoblotting, Ouchterlony assays, titer assays, etc.",

A subject suspected of having TBRF can be identified as having symptoms such as a high fever (e.g., 103\u00b0 F.), headache, muscle and joint aches. Symptoms typically reoccur, producing a telltale pattern of fever lasting roughly 3 days, followed by approximately 7 days without fever, followed by another 3 days of fever. Without proper antibiotic treatment, this process can repeat several times. Since the symptoms of TBRF can mimic, for example, viral flu-like symptoms, accurate diagnosis of TBRF is important for providing an effective treatment for the subject. The present invention provides a quick and easy diagnostic test for detecting the presence of antibodies specific for the causative Borrelia species, thereby satisfying the need for such a test.",
                        "The method of the present invention for detecting Borrelia antisera in a sample from a subject suspected of having TBRF, may comprise, for example, providing a biological sample (e.g., blood, saliva) obtained from a subject suspected of having TBRF, mixing the biological sample with one or more of the labeled and/or bound amino acid sequences of the present invention and detecting a positive reaction which indicates the presence of TBRF antisera in the sample. The antisera may be detected by, for example, immunoblotting, Elispot, ELISA, Western blotting or any other appropriate immunoassay known to one of ordinary skill in the art. These techniques are known to one of ordinary skill in the art and procedures can be found in common technical references. While similar, each of these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages. Other suitable techniques may be known to those of skill in the art and are incorporated herein.",
                        "Briefly, Western blotting can involve separating proteins by electrophoresis and then transferring to nitrocellulose or other solid media (e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride or PVDF-membrane and nylon membrane), and is described in more detail below. Immunoblotting can also involve applying proteins to a solid media manually or by machine. Preferably, the proteins are applied in straight lines or spots and dried, binding them to the solid support medium, e.g., nitrocellulose. The proteins used in an immunoblot can be isolated from biological samples or produced by recombinant technology, as is well known by those of ordinary skill in the art. The bound proteins are then exposed to a sample or samples suspected of having antibodies specific for the target proteins.",
                        "With this procedure, a known antibody can be used to determine if a protein is present in a sample, such as when the proteins of lysed cells are separated by electrophoresis and transferred to the solid medium. Western blotting allows for the identification of proteins by size as well as by specificity for a specific antibody.",
                        "Similarly, with a procedure called immunoblotting, known proteins can be bound to the solid medium and samples, such as samples from subjects suspected of having an infection, can be tested for the presence of specific antibodies in the sample by contacting the bound protein with the sample. An antibody that binds the target protein is usually referred to as the primary antibody. A secondary antibody, specific for conserved regions of the primary antibody (for example, a rabbit-anti-human IgG antibody may be used to detect primary human antibodies) is used to detect any bound primary antibodies. The secondary antibody is usually labeled with a detectable moiety for visualization. Non-limiting examples of suitable labels include, for example, chromophores such as biotin, radioactive moieties and enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, etc. The use of these and other materials for the visualization of antibodies are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art.",
                        "The Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) method can detect human T cells that respond to TBRFspecific antigens in vitro. In an ELISPOT assay, the surfaces of PVDF membrane in a 96-well microtiter plate are coated with capture antibody that binds, for example, anti-Interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) or other cytokine-specific antibody. During the cell incubation and stimulation step, the T cells isolated from patient whole blood are seeded into the wells of the plate along with aforementioned sequence(s), and form substantially a monolayer on the membrane surface of the well. Upon stimulation of any antigen-specific cells with one or more of the sequences of the present invention they are activated and they release the IFN\u03b3, which is captured directly on the membrane surface by the immobilized antibody. The IFN\u03b3 is thus \u201ccaptured\u201d in the area directly surrounding the secreting cell, before it has a chance to diffuse into the culture media, or to be degraded by proteases and bound by receptors on bystander cells. Subsequent detection steps visualize the immobilized IFN\u03b3 as an ImmunoSpot; essentially the secretory footprint of the activated cell.",
                        "For a specific example of an ELISPOT test, each well of the plate is coated with a purified cytokine-specific antibody specific for the test or cell being detected. Subject's (i.e., a subject suspected of having TBRF) T cells are isolated and cultured in each well and stimulated with recombinant antigens of one or more sequences of the present invention. TBRF-positive patient cells secrete cytokine in response to stimuli, which is captured by the antibody coated in the well and further detected by ELISA.",
                        "ELISA assays are also used to detect antigens. The ELISA assay can permit the quantification of a specific protein in a mix of proteins (for example, a lysate) or determine if a peptide is present in a sample. Likewise, ELISA assays can be used to determine if a specific antibody is present by using a specific antigen as a target. As used with the present invention, target amino acid sequence(s) are attached to a surface. Then, if present in the sample being tested, the reactive antibody can bind to the antigen. A secondary antibody linked to an enzyme is added, and, in the final step, a substance containing the enzyme's substrate is added. The subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change in the substrate.",

Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection.",
                        "Vaccines are typically administered with adjuvants. Adjuvants are compounds and mixtures of compounds designed or found to aid in stimulation of the immune system. For example an adjuvant is a pharmacological or immunological agent that modifies the effect of other agents. Adjuvants may be added to a vaccine to modify the immune response by boosting it such as to produce a greater quantity of antibodies and provide longer-lasting protection, thus minimizing the amount of injected foreign material. Adjuvants may also be used to enhance the efficacy of a vaccine by helping to modify the immune response to particular types of immune system cells. There are different classes of adjuvants that can skew immune responses in different directions. For example, adjuvants may selectively skew the immune response by preferentially activating T cells or B cells depending on the purpose of the vaccine. Adjuvants may also be used in the production of antibodies from immunized animals. For example, rabbit anti-human IgG antibodies may be produced by inoculating a rabbit with conserved portions of a human IgG antibody in combination with an adjuvant. The most commonly used adjuvants include aluminum hydroxide, paraffin oil and Freud's complete and incomplete adjuvant.",
                        "Although not fully understood adjuvants are believed to apply their effects through different mechanisms. Some adjuvants, such as alum, function as delivery systems by generating depots that trap antigens at the injection site, providing a slow release that continues to stimulate the immune system.

The combination of temperature and salt concentration is more important in defining stringency than either the temperature or the salt concentration alone. Other conditions which affect stringency include GC content of the compared sequence, extent of complementarity of the sequences, and length of the sequences involved in the hybridization, as well as the composition of buffer solution(s) used in the hybridization mixture.
