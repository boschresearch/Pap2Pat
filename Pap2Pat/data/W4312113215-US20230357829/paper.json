    "abstract": "Ultraviolet crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methodologies enable the identification of RNA binding sites of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Despite improvements in the library preparation of RNA fragments, the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol requires 4 days of hands-on time and lacks the ability to process several RBPs in parallel. We present a new method termed antibody-barcode eCLIP that utilizes DNA-barcoded antibodies and proximity ligation of the DNA oligonucleotides to RBP-protected RNA fragments to interrogate several RBPs simultaneously. We observe performance comparable with that of eCLIP with the advantage of dramatically increased scaling while maintaining the same material requirement of a single eCLIP experiment.",

                "RBPs are critical regulators of gene expression, controlling the rate, location and timing of RNA maturation1\u20134. As such, dysregulation of RBP function is associated with diverse genetic and somatic disorders, such as neurodegeneration and cancer5,6. To uncover the molecular mechanisms by which RBPs affect RNA processing, technologies such as RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and CLIP facilitate transcriptome-wide RNA binding site identification7\u201310. eCLIP enabled the generation of 223 eCLIP datasets profiling targets for 150 RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cell lines via a standardized protocol11. These target maps revealed unexpected principles of RNA processing11\u201313. However, the number of protein-coding genes with experimental or computational evidence for RNA-binding properties continues to increase, accounting for at least around 15% of the human genome14\u201317, and our ENCODE pilot still represents less than 10% of annotated RBPs.",
                "We opine that reducing the technical complexity of the eCLIP protocol is pivotal to accelerating our progress toward an exhaustive characterization of RBPs. Two main limitations to scaling remain. First, all current CLIP-based methods feature SDS\u2013PAGE and a nitrocellulose membrane transfer step to size-select for the immunoprecipitated protein\u2013RNA complex18\u201320. This manual excision of estimated protein\u2013RNA bands is tedious, requires an additional 1.5\u20132\u2009days and is vulnerable to user-to-user variation. Second, each individual RBP requires a separate immunoprecipitation (IP) step, which places a burden on the quantity of input material required for studying many RBPs.",
                "Here, we develop antibody-barcode eCLIP (ABC). Our optimizations address both of the constraints of eCLIP through the incorporation of DNA-barcoded antibodies that allow on-bead proximity-based ligations to replace the SDS\u2013PAGE and membrane transfer steps. The DNA barcodes also enable the identity of different RBPs within the same sample to be distinguished, dramatically reducing the input requirement per RBP (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1). We evaluated ABC using two well-characterized RBPs, RNA Binding Fox-1 Homolog 2 (RBFOX2), which recognizes GCAUG motifs, and the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), which interacts specifically with histone mRNAs. After observing no change in IP efficiency after antibody barcoding, (Supplementary Fig. 1) duplicate singleplex ABC experiments for RBFOX2 were performed in HEK293XT cells. SLBP was similarly interrogated in K562 cells. Reads were mapped and processed as previously described11,21. We first compared the library complexity as a surrogate measure of library efficiency by enumerating the number of \u2018usable\u2019 reads, defined as reads that map uniquely to the genome and remain after discarding PCR duplicates. We observed that eCLIP and ABC exhibited similar library complexity (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Library yield was dependent on UV crosslinking as a no UV control displayed a 32-fold decrease by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Examination of individual binding sites revealed comparable read density between ABC and eCLIP at RBFOX2 (for example, intronic region of NDEL1) and SLBP (for example, 3\u2032\u2009untranslated region (UTR) of H1\u20132) binding sites (Fig. 1b)12.Fig. 1ABC singleplex evaluation.a, Schematic of ABC and eCLIP workflows.

                "To evaluate ABC with a transcriptome-wide view, we initially focused on RBFOX2 and observed that peaks from ABC showed similar enrichments to downsampled eCLIP data in proximal and distal introns (Extended Data Fig. 3a) and were significantly enriched for the RBFOX2 motif (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Reproducible peaks obtained from irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) analysis of RBFOX2 eCLIP data serve as empirically defined RBFOX2 sites. We observed that the proportion of ABC reads present within reproducible RBFOX2 peaks also mirrors eCLIP (Fig. 1c). We also compared the fraction of reads that contained the conserved GCAUG sequence, as evolutionarily sequence conserved RBFOX2 motifs are more likely to be authentic sites22 (Supplementary Note 1). We observed that the fraction of reads that contain the conserved motif is similar (around 0.38% for eCLIP, and around 0.4% for ABC; Fig. 1c). As RBFOX2 exhibits positional dependencies in its regulation of alternative splicing22, we demonstrated that ABC-derived peaks reproduced the eCLIP enrichment for RBFOX2 binding upstream and within exons that are included in the mature mRNA exons; as well as binding downstream to enhance exon recognition and exclusion from mature mRNA (Fig. 1d). Next, we shifted our focus to SLBP. Both ABC and eCLIP displayed a similar percent of reads that map to histone RNAs (Fig. 1e). Metagene analysis also revealed a peak at the well-characterized stem-loop within the 3\u2032\u2009UTR of histone mRNAs (Fig. 1f). To compare the gene level enrichment, we ranked genes by the most enriched peaks after normalization and identified the top 100 genes in each dataset. Both technologies exhibited similar enrichment of histone genes (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Table 1). Our comparison of ABC and eCLIP analyses for the RBPs RBFOX2 and SLBP suggests that ABC performs with comparable sensitivity and specificity to eCLIP at both read and peak-level features.",
                "A defining advantage of ABC over current CLIP-based methodologies is that several RBPs can be interrogated simultaneously from a single sample (Fig. 2a). To demonstrate this key feature, in addition to RBFOX2, we selected nine other RBPs previously characterized by ENCODE3 (ref. 11) in K562 cells to exhibit a diversity of known binding preferences within genic regions indicative of function: DDX3 and EIF3G in the 5\u2032\u2009UTR; IGF2BP2, FAM120A, PUM2 and ZC3H11A in the 3\u2032\u2009UTR; LIN28B in the CDS; SF3B4 in branch point recognition at the 3\u2032\u2009splice site and PRPF8, which is downstream of the 5\u2032\u2009splice site. We performed triplicate, multiplexed ABC experiments after conjugating barcoded oligonucleotides to each RBP specific antibody. These antibodies were previously validated by ENCODE7,11. After computational deconvolution of the barcodes, we processed each RBP within each ABC sample separately. For each RBP, we removed reads that map to repetitive elements, only retaining reads that mapped uniquely to the human genome. As each antibody in a multiplexed reaction immunoprecipitates different amounts of protein\u2013RNA targets due to factors such as protein expression and expression levels of RNA targets, we expectedly observe nonuniform coverage across barcodes. For a fair comparison, we computationally downsampled the uniquely mapping eCLIP reads to the same sequencing depth as the demultiplexed ABC libraries (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 2) and observed similar library complexity (Extended Data Fig. 4).Fig. 2ABC multiplex comparision.a, Genome browser tracks of selected RBP binding sites depicting similar read coverage between ABC (teal) and ENCODE eCLIP (orange). Each binding site was grouped normalized to all RBPs using RPM. b, Stacked bar plots of the fraction of significant peaks (two-sided enrichment P\u2009<\u20090.001 and greater than eightfold change) localized to each RNA feature in K562 cells.

Rows are labeled by their respective treatment of \u2018background\u2019 to determine significantly enriched peaks using as background RNA-seq, CC and SMI.

Peak intensity was normalized such that the total density for each sample was equal to 1. Duplicate eCLIP and triplicate ABC experiments are displayed adjacent to each other. d, ABC enriched peaks (compared with CC) and eCLIP enriched peaks (compared with SMI) were mapped across a merged metagene (protein-coding mRNA) for each RBP. Peak intensity was normalized such that the total density for each sample was equal to 1. Triplicate ABC and duplicate eCLIP datasets are displayed adjacent to each other. e, ABC enriched peaks (compared with CC) and eCLIP enriched peaks (compared with SMI) were intersected to find the number of overlapping peaks. The overlap coefficient is defined as (number of overlapping peaks per total number of peaks in the smaller of the two datasets). The total number of peaks are displayed as a bar chart outside of the heatmap. Triplicate ABC and duplicate eCLIP datasets are displayed adjacent to each other.",
                "Peak-calling by CLIPper23 was performed with the same parameters on the ABC and eCLIP samples. The numbers of initial peaks were similar between ABC and eCLIP (Extended Data Fig. 5). To identify statistically significantly enriched peaks over background, the eCLIP protocol incorporates a size-matched input (SMI) control representing all RBP\u2013RNA interactions (including the interrogated RBP) in the same migratory range on the gel and membrane to capture nonspecific background RNAs12. However, as ABC removed the gel and membrane transfer steps, we reasoned that an alternative but related measure of the specificity for an RBP on a binding site is achieved by leveraging the binding information from all (other) RBPs in the multiplexed reaction as a \u2018complement\u2019 control (CC; Supplementary Fig. 2). To do so, we computed the chi-squared statistic using the observed number of reads within the region specified by a given RBP peak, relative to the total number of reads for that RBP, compared with the number of reads from the other nine RBPs within the same region, relative to the total number of reads for those RBPs. ABC peaks that satisfied thresholds of P\u2009<\u20090.001 computed with the chi-square statistic and were greater than eightfold higher over CC were deemed enriched peaks for that RBP. For the four RBPs, RBFOX2, PUM2, PRPF8 and SF3B4, which have well-characterized motifs, HOMER24 identified their respective motifs from the ABC enriched peaks de novo (Extended Data Fig. 6).",
                "Next, we observed that the enriched peaks from ABC had similar distributions across genic regions to their eCLIP counterparts (Fig. 2b), with an equivalent number of total peaks (Extended Data Fig. 5). We also compared the differences in the representation of genic features among the enriched peaks when we utilized total RNA-seq25,26. Using CC to compute statistical significance and fold changes resulted in improved ranking of the genic regions known to be preferred by the RBP (Extended Data Fig. 7a). For example, intronic regions are better represented among the highly ranked peaks for the splicing factor RBFOX2, compared with using RNA-seq as background. Furthermore, compared with RNA-seq as background, we found that peaks prioritized by CC have fewer overlaps with discarded eCLIP peaks (using SMI as background) (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). This suggests that CC accounts for the experimental background better than total RNA-seq. Interestingly, when all the RBPs in the multiplex set (which did not contain SLBP) were used as the CC in analysis of the SLBP singleplex experiment, peaks in histone RNAs are prioritized higher in rank, compared with using RNA-seq as background (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e).",
                "To analyze the peak locations with higher resolution around splice sites, we plotted the metagene profiles of the enriched peaks for the spliceosomal proteins SF3B4 and PRPF8. Both RBPs displayed strong positional preferences proximal to their respective splice sites (Fig. 2c). We observed that the ABC-derived peaks (CC) for PRPF8 were closer to the annotated 5\u2032\u2009splice sites than the eCLIP-derived peaks (SMI) (Fig. 2b). All ten RBPs also displayed similar binding distributions in the metagene profiles on spliced mRNA features for both ABC and eCLIP (Fig. 2d). Finally, to confirm that ABC and eCLIP were recovering the same binding sites, we computed the overlap coefficient between ABC and eCLIP replicates. There is a notable overlap between enriched peaks in ABC and eCLIP (Fig. 2e). In addition to intra-RBP similarity, there was overlap between RBPs known to bind similar features, like the 5\u2032\u2009UTR binding proteins DDX3 and EIF3G. The average read coverage of ABC and eCLIP peaks was also found to be highly correlated for all RBPs (Extended Data Fig. 8). No differences in peak distributions or quantity were observed when accounting for differences in read depth and peak coverage correlated between single and tenplex (10plex) ABC experiments (Extended Data Fig. 9). This demonstrated that multiplexing RBPs had no appreciable difference on the quality of the data compared with singleplex experiments.",
                "We conclude that a single ABC library (from 1 tube) generates similar overall results to ten separate eCLIP experiments (from 20 tubes). By simply increasing the number of barcodes, this advantage will grow. We note potential limitations. Removal of the SDS\u2013PAGE gel does prevent ABC from resolving higher-order protein\u2013RNA complexes that can be resolved by gel electrophoresis27. In multiplexing, the coverage across the different RBPs will be determined by their antibody IP efficiency and expression levels. While using CC to identify peaks that were enriched for specific RBPs within the pool, we obviate the separate SMI library requirement. However, it is important to consider the number and variety of RBPs when implementing CC as these can affect the ranking of protein\u2013RNA interaction sites (Extended Data Fig. 10). As with all CLIP experiments it is also critical to use high quality antibodies. Despite these caveats, the unprecedented scalability of ABC will facilitate the broad annotation of RBPs in clinically relevant samples, like disease tissues, where source materials are rare and often input-limited."

We utilized the splicing microarray-defined (n\u2009=\u2009150) differentially included and skipped cassette exon events upon loss of RBFOX2 (ref. 12). The genome coordinates are subsequently converted to GRCh38 using UCSC liftover. We define the following regions surrounding each cassette exon: the upstream exon is defined as the exon 5\u2032 to the cassette exon; the downstream exon is defined as the exon 3\u2032 to the cassette exon and the upstream intron is defined as the intron between the upstream exon and the cassette exon. The downstream flanking intron is the intron between the cassette and downstream exon. To test if there is enrichment of significant peaks (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and were greater than eightfold change) in each region, we used the chi-squared test to test for significance in enrichment in binding in the above defined region, against a set of randomly sampled cassette exons (n\u2009=\u20091,500, \u2018background events\u2019) with no change upon RBFOX2 KD.
