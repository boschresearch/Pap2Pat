    "title": "Machine learning enables detection of early-stage colorectal cancer by whole-genome sequencing of plasma cell-free DNA",
    "date": "2018-11-24",
    "abstract": "Background Blood-based methods using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are under development as an alternative to existing screening tests. However, early-stage detection of cancer using tumor-derived cfDNA has proven challenging because of the small proportion of cfDNA derived from tumor tissue in early-stage disease. A machine learning approach to discover signatures in cfDNA, potentially reflective of both tumor and non-tumor contributions, may represent a promising direction for the early detection of cancer. Methods Whole-genome sequencing was performed on cfDNA extracted from plasma samples (N=546 colorectal cancer and 271 non-cancer controls). Reads aligning to protein-coding gene bodies were extracted, and read counts were normalized. cfDNA tumor fraction was estimated using IchorCNA. Machine learning models were trained using k-fold cross-validation and confounder-based cross-validation to assess generalization performance. Results In a colorectal cancer cohort heavily weighted towards early-stage cancer (80% stage I/II), we achieved a mean AUC of 0.92 (95% CI 0.91-0.93) with a mean sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 83-86%) at 85% specificity. Sensitivity generally increased with tumor stage and increasing tumor fraction. Stratification by age, sequencing batch, and institution demonstrated the impact of these confounders and provided a more accurate assessment of generalization performance. Conclusions A machine learning approach using cfDNA achieved high sensitivity and specificity in a large, predominantly early-stage, colorectal cancer cohort. The possibility of systematic technical and institution-specific biases warrants similar confounder analyses in other studies. Prospective validation of this machine learning method and evaluation of a multi-analyte approach are underway.",

                "Despite the public health emphasis on population-level cancer screening in recent decades, adherence remains lower than desired [1], and cancer is often detected too late for successful treatment. For example, nearly 60% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, and approximately 80% of pancreatic cancer cases, are detected after regional or distant metastases [2]. Although the burden of CRC has been decreasing, CRC remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the United States [2]. Current cancer screening methods are often invasive, inconvenient, expensive, and/or have suboptimal clinical performance (i.e., sensitivity or specificity), particularly for early-stage disease and precancerous lesions [3].",
                "Recently, blood-based screening tests for cancer have been proposed in an effort to address some of the aforementioned challenges. One key area of both academic and commercial interest is circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which includes both tumor-derived DNA (so-called \u201ccirculating tumor DNA\u201d, or ctDNA) and DNA derived from non-tumor cells, such as hematopoietic and stromal cells, to supplement or replace existing cancer screening methods.",
                "Different screening approaches using cfDNA are being explored, and some have hypothesized that ctDNA-only based \u201cliquid biopsies\u201d may enable sensitive and specific early detection of cancer ([4\u20137]. ctDNA has unique characteristics of tumor DNA, such as cancer-associated mutations, translocations, and/or large chromosomal copy number variants (CNVs), not typically present in the cfDNA of healthy patients [8]. In addition, ctDNA fragments appear to be shorter on average than cfDNA found in healthy subjects [9]. However, others have questioned whether such an approach is feasible for routine screening, given biological (e.g., clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP)), technical (e.g., limits of detection and variable levels of tumor fraction (TF) observed in cancer patients), and practical (e.g., blood volume requirements and cost) considerations [10\u201312]. In patients with cancer, ctDNA generally represents a small fraction of all cfDNA, ranging from \u22655\u201310% in late-stage disease to \u22640.01\u20131.0% in early-stage disease, and even lower in premalignant conditions [13]. These limitations are particularly important in early-stage cancer when the tumor is small and the shedding of DNA into the blood may be minimal. Indeed, many previous cfDNA studies have had stage distributions meaningfully different from those seen in screening populations [14\u201316].",
                "An alternative to detection based solely on ctDNA is to look more broadly at cfDNA\u2014both tumor derived and non-tumor derived\u2014and changes that early-stage cancer may induce in blood. There is growing evidence of interactions between cancerous cells and other cells, including fibroblasts, platelets, and immune cells, especially within the tumor microenvironment. These include findings of \u201ctumor education\u201d, such as changes in gene expression that may reflect interaction with a tumor and/or ingestion of tumor-related molecules [17]. For example, platelets in patients with cancer harbor different patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) than platelets in healthy individuals [18]. There are also reports of changes in immune-cell apoptosis patterns in patients with cancer [19], suggesting global changes in hematopoietic cell populations that may reflect altered physiological states. For instance, low relative levels of circulating lymphocytes versus monocytes may be correlated with poor cancer prognosis [20]. It is possible to detect such changes in cell populations from cfDNA because cfDNA fragmentation and methylation patterns can recapitulate expected cellular epigenetic states [15, 16, 21\u201323].",
                "Because it is still unknown to what extent circulating cells in patients with early-stage cancer are educated by the tumor microenvironment (i.e., how changes in cellular state are explicitly reflected in the billions of base pairs of cfDNA), the ability to identify disease-relevant patterns in cfDNA requires unbiased methods that can identify patterns in high-dimensional space. Given a large enough sample size, machine learning (ML) may provide a toolset by which to learn disease-related patterns from whole-genome signals directly from patients with and without early-stage cancer. However, the primary challenge in an assay with many measured variables is to identify relevant, low-dimensional features that generalize to the screening population [24, 25]. As a corollary, it is necessary to mitigate potential confounding variables, defined as variables that are correlated with the clinical label which in this case is the disease label. For example, batch effects or institutional processing effects can be a significant variable that correlates with non-cancerous and cancerous samples.",
                "Here we develop and implement a computational approach for representing and learning associations between cfDNA profiles and cancer status, with a focus on the importance of accounting for known confounding variables. Using this approach, we report classification results for a large cohort of non-cancer controls and early-stage CRC patients."

Reads were aligned to the human genome using BWA-MEM 0.7.15 [26]; all datasets passing quality control (based on acceptable GC bias, sufficient number of reads, and no evidence of contamination or sample swaps) continued to featurization. Aligned reads were transformed into per-sample feature vectors by counting the number of fragments appearing in protein-coding genes. Features were normalized per-sample by dividing by the trimmed mean (excluding top and bottom 10% of counts) over all features and applying Loess GC bias correction [27]. Categorical features used in certain experiments (binned age, sex, and institution) were featurized using a one-hot encoding.

                "In this work, we focused our approach on cfDNA count profiles across the whole human genome (~\u20093200\u2009Mb) at relatively low depth (~9X), as opposed to existing liquid biopsy approaches that assess small regions (<\u20092\u2009Mb) of the genome at very high depth (~\u200960,000X) to detect tumor-derived mutations. In particular, we applied ML methods to perform unbiased discovery of signals of varying origin that may inform on the presence of a tumor (including both tumor-derived CNVs as well as potentially non-tumor-derived signals such as changes in the epigenetic states of circulating immune cells) vis-\u00e0-vis focusing on only tumor-derived mutations. This parallels previous research in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): Kim et al. demonstrated that an ML-based regression algorithm operating on genome-wide count data was able to accurately estimate fetal fraction in the cfDNA of pregnant women, without the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphism differences between mother and fetus [32]. Additionally, unlike liquid biopsy approaches using ultra-high-depth sequencing, the use of relatively low depth meaningfully decreases the cost of testing and permits the use of reasonable blood volumes, both of which will ultimately be required for population-level screening [12]. Finally, approaches focused on mutation detection alone can miss certain types of tumor-derived signals (e.g., genome-wide CNVs and epigenetic modifications), which are by definition most scarce in early-stage (i.e., non-metastatic) disease and pre-cancerous lesions, the detection of which is the goal of cancer screening programs.",
                "While we have not yet directly determined the exact contributions to classifier performance from tumor- versus non-tumor-derived sources, several lines of evidence suggest that both may be present. First, while the observed relationship between AUC and inferred TF (Fig.\u00a03d) indicates that at least some of the classification power is likely attributable to the ability of the model to identify samples with abundant ctDNA, the ability to correctly classify samples with lower TF and/or early-stage disease suggests that ctDNA alone cannot fully account for classification performance. Second, a CRC classification model based solely on an estimated TF (inferred from CNV calls) performs relatively poorly, with an AUC lower than all tested CV results for the ML method, suggesting that non-CNV sources may contribute to our ML-based classifier. Future research will focus on better understanding the underlying biology of the classifier, as well as assessing potential improvements in model performance from the addition of other analytes and ML method development, including confounder mitigation.",
                "In the presence of inadequately controlled confounders, ML methods are prone to learn irrelevant associations; this poses a critical challenge for the use of ML for biomarker discovery [33\u201336]. Certain confounders can be mitigated \u201cup front\u201d through experimental design (e.g., demographic biases and institution bias) or operational quality control (e.g., identification of known parameter drift). This can help minimize the dependence between class label and any potential noise-inducing variable but incurs an additional cost in time and/or operational expense. However, perfect control of confounders at the design stage is not realistic: Some variables may be intrinsically confounding in the population of interest (e.g., cancer incidence increases with age), and there are modes of variation which may exist but which may not be known a priori and therefore mitigated post hoc (e.g., batch-to-batch variability in sequencing).",
                "A key contribution of this work is the presentation and analysis of cross-validation techniques specifically tailored to go beyond traditional k-fold validation to measure and mitigate a number of pervasive confounding effects in biomarker discovery: k-batch and ordered k-batch for different scales of process variability in time, respectively, and balanced k-batch for institution-specific biases. We found that standard k-fold CV can have higher performance than confounder-controlled CV methods, consistent with the historical difficulty in reproducing discovery studies. We believe that explicit stratification for technical and biological confounders may be used as standard practice to better evaluate the generalizability of early discovery results.",
                "The current study has a number of potential limitations. First, because samples were obtained retrospectively, breaks in the chain of custody may have led to sample and labelling errors, which would impede the ability of an ML method to adequately learn. Additionally, the presence of CNVs in a small number of control samples (Additional file 3: Figure S2) has been previously observed in other cohorts and may be due to malignant or benign causes [5, 14, 37]; further follow up was not possible in this cohort. Another limitation of our study is that TF was estimated using copy-number inference from moderate-coverage whole-genome sequencing, which as implemented here has a limit of detection of 0.8% for TF; by contrast, targeted mutation detection would allow more sensitive characterization of TF. Finally, cross validation is a widely used approach for assessment of classification performance and, as implemented here, can address known individual confounders. However, cross-validation procedures do not control for all confounders simultaneously, and the use of an independent test set is ultimately needed to evaluate the generalizability of these results. Prospective studies are underway to validate classifier performance in an independent cohort and verify generalization predictions from confounder-controlled CV.",
                "Although this study focused on CRC, this study approach is directly applicable to other cancers and indeed to other pathological and physiological conditions. Our approach extracts signals from certain biological states and can apply them to better understand others; however, full development and validation of classifiers to address different clinical and non-clinical applications will require additional samples in those specific populations. Unlike targeted mutation approaches which require identification of disease-specific targets, this whole genome approach allows for the unbiased discovery of signals which are not disease-specific and could even be extended to the assessment and monitoring of non-disease states. Additionally, this approach should be able to detect unique epigenetic patterns for other diseases, thereby providing specificity by differentiating CRC from other cancers [38]. Efforts are currently underway to evaluate these hypotheses."
