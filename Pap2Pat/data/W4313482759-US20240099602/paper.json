    "title": "Automated seizure onset zone locator from resting-state functional MRI in drug-resistant epilepsy",

    "abstract": "Accurate localization of a seizure onset zone (SOZ) from independent components (IC) of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) improves surgical outcomes in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Automated IC sorting has limited success in identifying SOZ localizing ICs in adult normal rs-fMRI or uncategorized epilepsy. Children face unique challenges due to the developing brain and its associated surgical risks. This study proposes a novel SOZ localization algorithm (EPIK) for children with DRE.EPIK is developed in a phased approach, where fMRI noise-related biomarkers are used through high-fidelity image processing techniques to eliminate noise ICs. Then, the SOZ markers are used through a maximum likelihood-based classifier to determine SOZ localizing ICs. The performance of EPIK was evaluated on a unique pediatric DRE dataset (n = 52). A total of 24 children underwent surgical resection or ablation of an rs-fMRI identified SOZ, concurrently evaluated with an EEG and anatomical MRI. Two state-of-art techniques were used for comparison: (a) least squares support-vector machine and (b) convolutional neural networks. The performance was benchmarked against expert IC sorting and Engel outcomes for surgical SOZ resection or ablation. The analysis was stratified across age and sex.EPIK outperformed state-of-art techniques for SOZ localizing IC identification with a mean accuracy of 84.7% (4% higher), a precision of 74.1% (22% higher), a specificity of 81.9% (3.2% higher), and a sensitivity of 88.6% (16.5% higher). EPIK showed consistent performance across age and sex with the best performance in those < 5 years of age. It helped achieve a ~5-fold reduction in the number of ICs to be potentially analyzed during pre-surgical screening.Automated SOZ localization from rs-fMRI, validated against surgical outcomes, indicates the potential for clinical feasibility. It eliminates the need for expert sorting, outperforms prior automated methods, and is consistent across age and sex.",

                "Epilepsy is devastating, affecting 50 million people worldwide (WHO). One in 150 children have epilepsy (Aaberg et al., 2017;Epilepsy Foundation, 2018), with 30% having drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE; Wieser et al., 2001;Kwan and Sander, 2004;Kwan and Brodie, 2010), which causes significant morbidity and mortality (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Shinnar, 2010;Laxer et al., 2014;Engel, 2016). A consensus proposal by the ad-hoc Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) proposed the following definition for DRE: \"a failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen, and used antiepileptic drug schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom (considered as freedom from all seizures, including auras) for at least 12 months\" (Kwan et al., 2010).",
                "Early diagnosis and treatment of DRE can potentially deflect complications such as evolution into status epilepticus (Prisco et al., 2020) and Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), wherein the individual dies due to cardio-respiratory failure from presumed nocturnal seizure activity (Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Shinnar, 2010). Moreover, in children, timely diagnosis, intensive management, and treatment are pivotal in minimizing neurological damage (Prisco et al., 2020). Further, the earliest onset of severe epilepsy in the neonatal population can lead to nearly constant life-threatening seizures requiring an urgent need for surgical evaluation early in life (Russ et al., 2021)."

            "paragraphs": [
                "The most effective treatment for DRE is surgery (Luders et al., 2006;Luckett et al., 2022). Early surgery is key: \"minimally invasive surgical treatment can be a life-changing option for DRE patients; hence management of the SOZ requiring disconnecting techniques (Young et al., 2020), or deep sited lesions requiring excision should be considered earlier rather than later (Chibbaro et al., 2017).\" Notably, recent findings showed that ultra-early (before 3 months old) surgical intervention in children evaluated to have DRE after trials of an average of four anti-seizure drugs, although seldom performed, has excellent epilepsy outcomes and leads to a decrease in usage of anti-seizure drugs, without any increased risk of surgeryrelated permanent morbidity (Roth et al., 2021).",
                "Brain imaging for pre-surgical screening Surgical intervention in DRE requires accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) for success. We make a distinction between the epileptic network (EN) and the SOZ. The EN denotes regions where seizure propagates and may be more extensive than the SOZ. As such, it may be difficult as well as unnecessary to surgically eliminate the EN since it can incorporate sensitive areas of the brain. Several brain imaging techniques have been explored to identify the ictal seizure onset zone, propagation zone (i.e., EN), and interictal activity (Table 1). This can be done with nuclear medicine-based imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) or ictal single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT; Desai et al., 2013). Recent studies suggest some SOZ identification capabilities for PET and SPECT in both adults and children; however, their accuracy heavily depends on the timing of the scan. Delay in drug infusion can result in the detection of the EN instead of the SOZ. Invasive modalities such as intracranial EEG (iEEG) are considered the gold standard for SOZ identification and have shown excellent accuracy for both adults and pediatric DRE. Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is minimally invasive, uses a three-dimensional configuration of depth electrodes to localize epileptiform activity, and has shown some SOZ identification capability recently (Satzer et al., 2022).",
                "However, traditional analysis of PET, SPECT, or SEEG is relatively, temporally, and spatially restricted, whereas functional interpolation of brain activity might allow for a non-invasive three-dimensional representation of epileptiform activity and avoid pitfalls inherent of other modalities (Table 1). Recently, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based non-invasive techniques have been analyzed for DRE in both adults and children and show decent SOZ identification capability. A combination of MEG and fMRI imaging has also been proposed Surface Identified in 66.7% of subjects (Mayoral et al., 2019) Only detects EN in 6.6% of patients and not SOZ (Bansal et al., 2016) Ictal SPECT Invasive 2, needs difference between ictal and inter-ictal SPECT (Desai et al., 2013) 6 mm 15 mins Surface Detects EN and not SOZ (Kaiboriboon et al., 2002;von Oertzen, 2018) Detects EN and not SOZ (Van Paesschen et al., 2007) MEG Non-invasive 1 10-20 mm <10 ms Cortex 75% accurate (Foley et al., 2021) in eight patients, 60% with ML in a large cohort (Nissen et al., 2018) Poor concordance with SOZ.

                        "for accurate SOZ identification (Berger et al., 2021). However, a major drawback of such brain imaging-based SOZ identification techniques is the heavy reliance on manual sorting of images and their components, which not only increases cost but also reduces accessibility and repeatability. Unfortunately, <1% of patients with DRE are evaluated for surgery and only 25% of those undergo surgery (Engel, 2016), partly due to the high cost of diagnostic and surgical treatment (>$200,000/patient) and the risk of debilitating impairment (Murray et al., 1996;Begley et al., 2000). Of the 1% evaluated, surgical failure rates are 30-70% despite the use of non-invasive SOZ-localization biomarkers such as anatomical MRI, scalp EEG, simultaneous EEG-fMRI, and magnetoencephalography, which are then often confirmed by invasive iEEG (McIntosh et al., 2004;Luders et al., 2006;Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Shinnar, 2010;Bulacio et al., 2012;Laxer et al., 2014;Engel, 2016;Epilepsy Foundation, 2018). Hence, for surgery to be safe and efficient for wide acceptance (England et al., 2012), accessible, minimally invasive, and accurate SOZ localization is essential.",
                        "One of the newer methods showing promise, to this end, is resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI has been shown to have an accurate SOZ-localization capacity through various analysis approaches (Bandt et al., 2014;van Houdt et al., 2015;Malmgren and Edelvik, 2017;Boerwinkle et al., 2018), but only independent component analysis (ICA; Gonzalez-Martinez et al., 2007) has provided Level 1 evidence and has led to improvement in surgical outcomes (Malmgren and Edelvik, 2017;Chakraborty et al., 2020) and candidacy (Boerwinkle et al., 2019) in DRE. However, expert interpretation of independent components (IC) into sources of noise, normal resting state networks (RSN), and SOZs (Hunyadi et al., 2014;Boerwinkle et al., 2017Boerwinkle et al., , 2020) limits reproducibility and availability. An automated whole-brain data-driven SOZ-localizing IC identification technique that is rigorously validated against surgical destruction outcomes, reproducible, equally effective across age and sex, and applicable to all epilepsy subtypes may greatly improve epilepsy care feasibility, morbidity, and mortality."

                "Functional MRI (fMRI) is a popular imaging technique originally used to identify brain activity in terms of blood oxygenation level change in different parts of the brain for a given mental task (Figure 1). However, for SOZ detection, it is required to identify blood oxygenation changes due to the onset of seizure. Hence, an important step is to remove other sources of brain activity such as mental tasks, fMRI noise, and head motion. Rs-fMRI requires the subject to be in a resting state, which is achieved in a majority of children through sedation. Even if any mental task is eliminated, there is still the presence of resting-state brain activity in subjects, which manifests as RSN Rs-fMRI ICA results in \u223c100 ICs. Each IC is a spatialtemporal distribution of regions of synchronous activity. In ICA of those with DRE, there are three IC categories: (1) RSNs which are well-described and validated in the literature;",

Recent studies considered two automation objectives in epilepsy with rs-fMRI (Table 2): (a) classification of subjects with or without epilepsy by identifying epilepsy networks using rs-fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal z-score latency maps (Lopes et al., 2012;Bharath et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2021), and (b) localization of the seizure onset zone using rs-fMRI ICs (Hunyadi et al., 2014(Hunyadi et al., , 2015;;Shah et al., 2019). Epilepsy networks indicate the areas of the brain that are affected by the propagation of a seizure. As such, they may not indicate the origin of the seizure, which is encapsulated by the SOZ. Our research focus in this study tackles the second automation objective of SOZ localization.",
                "Automated classification of rs-fMRI ICs as SOZ or RSN has been explored using supervised shallow machine learning (ML; Nozais et al., 2021) and using deep learning (DL) in healthy adults to identify the typical RSNs and is yet to be tested in epilepsy (Zhang et al., 2019; Table 2). Supervised ML indicates that the DRE population has to be divided into two parts: (a) a training set, which is used to configure the ML, and (b) a testing set, which is used to test the performance of the ML. Some supervised ML can also choose to utilize a validation set as mentioned in a previous study (Nguyen et al., 2021). The performance of the ML technique on the validation set is used to update the training process and improve the performance in the validation set. Hence, the performance on the validation set is excluded from the analysis in Table 2 and only the test set performance is reported. Recent automated (Luckett et al., 2022) methods to classify adult rs-fMRI into RSN, SOZ, and noise ICs are of three types: (1) voxel-based network measures quantifying the number of connections to each voxel in an IC, called voxel degree connectivity (VDC), as indicators for SOZ (Hunyadi et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2014). Such approaches have a small sample size (n \u2248 20) and show a maximum reported sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 57% (Table 2); (2) MLbased classification, with a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 77% (Hunyadi et al., 2014); and (3) DL approaches for only identifying RSN and noise, but not SOZs, for normal and non-DRE patients with epilepsy [accuracy 92% (Nozais et al., 2021) in Table 2].",
                "To date, automated approaches have not been successful in the classification of RSN, noise, and SOZ, in rs-fMRI for pediatric patients with DRE due to the following challenges: (1) Lack of normalized pathological rs-fMRI RSN data for children (Zhang et al., 2019); (2) databases with balanced instances of RSN, SOZ, and noise, large enough for DL techniques to effectively recognize the three IC categories that are not available; (3) the potentially inadequate performance of SOZ identification in children with DRE can indicate a high risk of developmental disorders post-surgery. Given that each patient only has 5% ICs as SOZ, a 40% sensitivity (Hunyadi et al., 2014) indicates that only two out of five SOZ ICs are correctly identified but 14 of them are wrongly identified as SOZ; and (4) fMRI-based pre-surgical mapping is more complicated for children with DRE due to developmental changes during cognitive maturation (Jiang et al., 2018;Bouyssi-Kobar et al., 2019), the impairment experienced due to DRE, and the normal representation of memory function during development (Michels et al., 2012;Darki and Klingberg, 2015;Cui et al., 2018;Kasradze et al., 2021), which may differ from adults (Faghiri et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2019;DeGeorge et al., 2021;Moncrief et al., 2021). Hence, the efficacy of fMRI classification techniques on adults needs to be reexamined for children with DRE.",
                "Most current studies (Table 2) focused on adult epilepsy with an unknown effect of the degree of hypothesized network disruption effect on localization. Currently available automated IC sorting techniques either only identify SOZ or RSN localizing ICs. Hunyadi et al. (2015), the first major work to attempt SOZ localizing ICs identification, used supervised ML but could only achieve a specificity of 77% and a sensitivity of 40% on a subset of the adult patient population. A more recent technique by Nozais et al. (2021) used DL to identify only RSN in healthy adults and reports an accuracy of 92%. The major drawback of DL techniques is the requirement for labeled data on all three IC categories. Table 2 shows that such labeled data is rarely available, even if we combine datasets from different authors, IC data labeled as RSN and SOZ are only available from 212 children with DRE. For DL to successfully recognize SOZ, it will need at least a balanced distribution of RSN and SOZ. The DL works in this domain utilize RSN data from 2,000 healthy subjects for appropriate training (Table 2; Nozais et al., 2021; . /fnimg. .  2015) only mentions concordance with surgical resection. Concordance is assumed to be true positive, and failure is assumed to be false negative. Hence percentage concordance is assumed to be sensitivity. ** Zhang et al. (2015) mentions success in rejecting non-epilepsy related IC. Rejection of non-epilepsy IC is assumed to be true negative and failure to reject is assumed to be false positive. Hence success rate is specificity. *** Lee et al. ( 2014) defines accordance with IC EEG. Accordance is assumed to be true positive, and failure is assumed to be false negative. Hence, percentage accordance is assumed to be sensitivity. ***** Sensitivity and specificity not mentioned. The high accuracy could also be due to the presence of a large number of true negatives.",

Luckett et al., 2022). Hence, to achieve balanced data, we would need SOZ from at least 2,000 subjects, a sample size that is currently not available.",

ML techniques (Figure 2) utilize examples of SOZ and RSN ICs to learn a model in the training phase, which is subsequently used for the identification of SOZ on previously unseen rs-fMRI signals. Such techniques have not been successful, possibly for the following reasons: (1) SOZ biomarkers are not precise and exhibit significant individual variances (Hunyadi et al., 2015;Boerwinkle et al., 2017) and (2) patients have low numbers of SOZ localizing ICs as compared to noise and RSN, leading to an imbalance in data and potential overfitting of ML models.",

                "EPIK (Figure 4) considers noise markers for ICs in an rs-fMRI, as documented in several studies including Griffanti et al. (2014Griffanti et al. ( , 2017)). The method applies rules in a waterfall technique to classify an IC as noise (Figure 4). If an IC is not noisy, then it classifies the IC as either an RSN or a SOZ. In detail, there are six expert-derived rules for IC noise markers, combined from Boerwinkle and Hunyadi's works (Table 4). Automated application of such rules necessitates the development of the following key components: a) Voxel cluster detection algorithm: A density-based scanning approach is undertaken to derive voxel clusters (upper panel Figure 4). The algorithm takes two configurable inputs: neighborhood, which includes a distance metric and a value \u01eb, and the minimum number of nearby voxels v min . If a voxel has more than v min voxels in the \u01eb neighborhood, then it is marked as a core point of a cluster. If a voxel is not a core point but is in \u01eb neighborhood of a core point, then it is identified as a border point. All other points are ignored from clusters. Core points, that are in \u01eb neighborhood of each other, are combined into one cluster, and border points are assigned to the cluster of the nearest core point. The output of this step is the set of clusters in each IC slice. b) Brain boundary/periphery detection: Contours in the brain are derived using a Sobel filter-based edge detection technique (Figure 4; Chakraborty et al., 2020). The lowest intensity contour is most likely the outer contour of the brain. However, the cerebrospinal fluid and blood vessels also present as low-intensity contours. The method searches for the contour that encompasses all other contours, which gives us the brain periphery. c) White matter detection: The white matter manifests as the brightest contour in the brain. The blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid in the white matter contour are discarded. d) Blood vessel detection: The major basal-region blood vessels present themselves as low-intensity contours encompassed in the brain periphery contour. e) Noise IC classification: Utilizing the a, b, c, and d steps, an IC can be classified as noise (Figure 5). From each slice of an IC, the clusters and the contours are extracted. An overlapping cluster can cause the contour detection algorithm to fail in extracting the peripheral, the white matter, and the blood vessel contours. In the initial pass through the ICs, EPIK obtains a version of each slice devoid of clusters, which is subsequently used to identify contours. The algorithm then reruns through each slice of an IC and performs cluster detection. It then evaluates the overlap of the largest cluster with the brain boundary (first row in Figure 5) and the intersection of the largest cluster with the white matter and blood vessels (third row in Figure 5). The output of the first stage classifier (upper panel in Figure 4) is a statistic for each slice on the cluster size, the percentage (%) overlap with the brain boundary, the blood vessels, and the white matter for each cluster in a slice.",
                "Each IC has multiple slices (around 55 for PCH dataset). The second stage classifier sorts the slices in decreasing order of cluster size (lower panel of Figure 2). It selects the top 10 slices  and checks the percentage overlap to determine noise slices. If the majority of the top 10 slices are noise, the IC is classified as a noise IC. If the IC passes through the majority evaluation, it is passed to the second-level classifier, which determines if it is a normal RSN or an SOZ (Figure 4). The SOZ classification is based on expert guidance on the SOZ markers in ICs, as documented in Hunyadi et al. (2013;2015;Table 4). f) BOLD signal feature extraction: The BOLD signal was first divided into windows of length 256 samples. Four levels of activelet transformation coefficients using \"\u00e0 trous\" algorithm with exponential-spline wavelets were extracted from each window. Sparsity in the activelet coefficients was evaluated using the Gini Index metric (Lerman and Yitzhaki, 1984)."

In addition, sparsity in matching pursuit using a sine dictionary limited to frequencies between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz was also evaluated using the Gini index. If an IC was classified as white noise, then it can be classified as SOZ if the BOLD signal Gini Index in the sine dictionary matching pursuit is >1.72. We used 4,212 ICs for training and 1,404 ICs for validation in the hyperparameter tuning process. The input shape of the IC image was downsampled from 1,006 \u00d7 709 \u00d7 3 to 270 \u00d7 400 \u00d7 3 during preprocessing. Binary cross-entropy was used as a loss function, and Adam was used as an optimizer.

This gives confidence that CNN can perform better if given an adequate number of training-SOZ-localizing ICs; this could be an avenue for future research.",
                        "The general assumption in supervised machine learning is that elements from each class come from a unique distribution specific to the class. The ML technique then attempts to learn the differences in the distribution of each class and evaluate the best fit distribution for the test data. The fundamental limitation of the LS-SVM approach is that SVM is inherently a two-class classifier. Although there are multi-class versions of SVM, the multi-class classification is performed in stages, where each stage is a two-class classifier. For rs-fMRI sorting, this would mean that the RSN and noise class will have to be combined into one composite class, while the SOZ ICs are labeled as the class of interest. In rs-fMRI, noise ICs are composed of several different categories of noise such as peripheral noise, white matter noise, and artery noise. Each such noise characteristic has different feature distributions; however, they are considered to be the same class by the supervised ML technique. Moreover, the noise class is combined with the RSN class to make a non-SOZ composite class. Hence, the non-SOZ composite class for rs-fMRI ICs has a composite distribution. As such, it is very difficult for the supervised ML classifier to learn the unique distribution of the non-SOZ IC class. A way around this is to learn each kind of noise and RSN separately. However, that requires data for each kind of noise from each patient. This cannot be guaranteed in a practical real-life setting.",
                        "The performance of the CNN-based DL strategy suffered because of the differences in the size of the three classes. RSN and noise classes had a nearly balanced data size, and the CNN strategy had good performance in distinguishing between them. However, since there are very limited SOZ IC examples, the CNN strategy could not reliably identify them.",
                        "The unsupervised technique utilizes expert knowledge and image processing algorithms to detect each kind of noise without the need for training a machine. Hence, it learns the noise characteristics without utilizing noise data from each patient. This capability of the unsupervised technique to employ specific algorithms for each type of noise and RSN is one of the major reasons for its success in separating noise, RSN, and SOZ ICs."

                "This study (n = 52) evaluated a small group of data, and prior automated methods perform well on small samples but have reduced performance on larger datasets; hence, EPIK needs large set validation, which is a future direction. Larger datasets for focused performance evaluation within each age bracket, including young and separately older adults, and the very young vs. middle childhood are needed. Subtypes of epilepsyacquired, congenital/genetic-and surgical approaches' success metrics should be statistically evaluated with acceptable power. Last, repeat studies in the same individuals over time would increase knowledge of the validity and reproducibility of the tool.",
                "The majority of the subjects in this study received propofol infusion for sedation as part of a standard of clinical care for epilepsy surgery evaluation. Head motion maximum was <1 mm of frame wise displacement in any direction. Although propofol use has minimal effect on the overall rs-fMRI BOLD signal, it puts small but additional risks on the child (Pizoli et al., 2011). Several research studies proposed alternate methods of reducing head motion by engaging the child with videos and post-processing by measuring and accounting for head movements through computational methods (Dosenbach et al., 2017;Greene et al., 2018;D'Andrea et al., 2022). An area of future study is to evaluate the effect of sedation on the EPIK SOZ identification accuracy and integration of live motion monitoring and reduction-based approaches toward the elimination of head movement artifacts."

                        "1. EPIK identified seizure onset zone (SOZ) localizing restingstate fMRI-independent components in children with drugresistant epilepsy with an accuracy of 84.7% in this preliminary study. 2. EPIK can reduce the number of potential ICs to be analyzed by the neurosurgeon by \u223c5-fold, hence significantly reducing the time commitment for pre-surgical evaluation. 3. EPIK is unsupervised and does not need any prior example of SOZ and works by codifying expert knowledge about fMRI noise and SOZ markers. 4. EPIK had consistent performance across age and gender and has been validated with surgical outcomes. 5. EPIK appeared to perform best for those under 5 years of age and thus may enable successful surgeries early in their life, potentially improving long-term postoperative outcomes. 6. EPIK preliminarily performed as well or better than shallow and deep learning systems for the identification of SOZ localizing ICs in a resting-state fMRI."
