## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- introduce concept of EPIK for SOZ localization in children with DRE

### Introduction and Technical Problems

- motivate need for accurate SOZ localization in DRE
- describe limitations of current brain imaging techniques for SOZ identification

### Proposed Solution to Technical Problems

- introduce fMRI-based screening for SOZ detection
- describe ICA for decoupling noise, RSN, and SOZ in rs-fMRI signals
- motivate automation of IC sorting for SOZ localization
- describe limitations of current automated approaches for SOZ localization
- introduce EPIK as a novel unsupervised technique for SOZ localization

### Materials and Methods

- define inclusion criteria for patients
- describe data collection method
- outline rs-fMRI data processing steps
- detail expert RS-fMRI evaluation methodology
- categorize rs-fMRI ICs into noise, RSN, and SOZ
- describe EPIK method for noise IC classification
- outline likelihood-based classification for SOZ ICs

### Overall Identification Results

- compare performance of EPIK with LS-SVM and CNN approaches

### Performance Variation with Age and Gender
