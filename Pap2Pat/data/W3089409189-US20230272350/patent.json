                        "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small enveloped virus, 30 to 80 nm in diameter, with a single positive stranded RNA genome, belonging to the Flaviviridae family. The RNA genome encodes three structural proteins, the capsid protein Core, and the envelope proteins E1 and E2, which are incorporated into the viral particle, as well as seven non-structural proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B). There are eight different major genotypes, differing in \u02dc30% of their nucleotide and amino acid sequence, with genotype 1 being most frequent worldwide.",
                        "Each year, there are at least 2 million new HCV infections, of which \u02dc80% result in chronic infections. There are at least 71 million chronically infected individuals worldwide with an increased risk for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in 400.000 deaths per year.",
                        "Only a minor fraction of HCV-infected individuals is treated with recently licensed efficient direct-acting antivirals (DAA). The main reasons for this are that most individuals are not aware of their infection status, as the infection is typically asymptomatic until a severe and often irreversible liver disease has developed, and because of the lack of screening programs and the high cost of DAA. Furthermore, resistance to DAA is increasing and might compromise future treatment efficacy. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to control HCV on a global scale.",
                        "Most antiviral vaccines are based on whole viral particles as vaccine antigens and protect by their induction of neutralizing antibodies. The proof-of-concept for the immunogenicity of cell culture-derived inactivated HCV has been obtained in animal models. However, in these studies, ultracentrifugation-based downstream processes (DSP) were employed for concentration and purification of cell culture-derived HCV. This approach is in general characterized by a relatively low recovery, a limited scalability, and a limited impurity depletion. Thus, as for most other vaccines, the development of an efficient DSP, compatible with industrial requirements, is a major bottleneck for the manufacturing of a whole virus HCV vaccine for human use.",
                        "Hence, an improved downstream process providing an efficient, scalable and GMP-compatible DSP for purification of cell culture-derived HCV to facilitate an industrial production of a human HCV vaccine would be advantageous."

In addition, the ultrafiltration further purifies the sample by removing impurities such as smaller host cell-derived proteins and DNA, which are below the molecular weight cut-off of the used devices.",
                                "The term \u201cchromatography\u201d is to be understood as a step performed by a chromatographic technique as known to the persons skilled in the art including anion-or cation exchange chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, SXC or SCMA as well as flow through methods such as Capto Core 700 chromatography or size exclusion chromatography.",
                                "The term \u201cSXC\u201d is to be understood as steric exclusion chromatography as commonly known to the persons skilled in the art. Steric exclusion chromatography is run in a membrane-containing column, where the sample is loaded via a loading buffer to the column for binding of the product to the membranes, the column is then washed to elute impurities from the column prior to eluting the product from the column by means of an elution buffer.",
                                "The term \u201cSCMA\u201d is to be understood as sulphated cellulose membrane absorbers as commonly known to the persons skilled in the art. SCMA is also a chromatography-based method, which is run in a membrane-containing column. The sample is loaded via a loading buffer to the column for binding of the product to the membranes, the column is then washed to elute impurities from the column prior to eluting the product from the column by means of an elution buffer.",

                                "The term \u201cvirus particles\u201d is to be understood as infectious viruses, inactive viruses as well as virus-like particles.",
                                "The term \u201cwhole virus particles\u201d is to be understood as virus particles, which consist of RNA or DNA surrounded by a protein shell, optionally surrounded by an envelope.",

                                "As commonly defined \u201cidentity\u201d is here defined as sequence identity between genes or proteins at the nucleotide or amino acid level, respectively. Thus, in the present context \u201csequence identity\u201d is a measure of identity between proteins at the amino acid level and a measure of identity between nucleic acids at nucleotide level. The protein sequence identity may be determined by comparing the amino acid sequence in a given position in each sequence when the sequences are aligned. Similarly, the nucleic acid sequence identity may be determined by comparing the nucleotide sequence in a given position in each sequence when the sequences are aligned. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps may be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions/total # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)\u00d7100).",
                                "One may manually align the sequences and count the number of identical amino acids. Alternatively, alignment of two sequences for the determination of percent identity may be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (Altschul et al. 1997; Altschul et al. 2005). BLAST nucleotide searches may be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches may be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST may be utilised. Alternatively, PSI-Blast may be used to perform an iterated search, which detects distant relationships between molecules. When utilising the NBLAST, XBLAST, and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs may be used.",
                                "See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Alternatively, sequence identity may be calculated after the sequences have been aligned e.g. by the BLAST program in the EMBL database (www.ncbi.nlm.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST). Generally, the default settings with respect to e.g. \u201cscoring matrix\u201d and \u201cgap penalty\u201d may be used for alignment. In the context of the present invention, the BLASTN and PSI BLAST default settings may be advantageous.",
                                "The percent identity between two sequences may be determined using techniques similar to those described above, with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity, only exact matches are counted.",
                                "It should be noted that while several of the sequences in the present application are DNA sequences, the present invention contemplates the corresponding RNA sequence, and DNA and RNA complementary sequences as well.",
                                "Thus, in cases where a DNA sequence is mentioned refers such DNA sequence also to the RNA equivalent i.e. with Ts exchanged with Us as well as their complimentary sequences.",

Furthermore, all introductions of mutations into the sequences described, whether or not yielding better growth abilities, and the introduction of these mutations into any HCV sequence should be considered. Throughout the description the adaptive mutations as described herein is to be interpreted as XZY being amino acid/nucleic acid \u201cX\u201d at position \u201cZ\u201d being changed to amino acid/nucleic acid \u201cY\u201d e.g. as an example A1226G is to be understood as the amino acid alanine (A) at position 1226 being changed to the amino acid glycine (G).",

Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous solution saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions are preferably employed as carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\u201d by E. W. Martin.",
                                "The term \u201cadjuvant\u201d refers to a compound or mixture that enhances the immune response to an antigen. An adjuvant can serve as a tissue depot that slowly releases the antigen and also as a lymphoid system activator that non-specifically enhances the immune response. Often, a primary challenge with an antigen alone, in the absence of an adjuvant, will fail to elicit a humoral or cellular immune responses.",

Also considering the higher immunogenicity of whole particles compared to envelope proteins, and the historic success of this strategy in antiviral vaccine development, whole virus particles are preferable. For HCV, this approach has only become feasible due to the relatively recent development of cell culture systems for the production of HCV. However, for a success of this strategy, it is important that the virus particles are purified from the cell cultures in an efficient manner and in a manner leaving only traces of impurities in the purified virus stock.",

This might be caused by the precipitation of proteins, medium components, or virus particles under these conditions. The pressure increase during DBC determination may be due to the possible aggregation potential of the virus, leading to increased membrane fouling for higher loading volumes. It is not likely, that an increased pore blockage is caused by protein impurities, as these are mostly washed out during sample application, with mainly virus particles remaining on the column. On a process scale, the pressure limitations might be additionally reduced as well as the binding capacity increased by using a different type of membrane housing, offering an altered angle of the incident flow.",

                                "The implementation of an additional nuclease treatment prior to SXC resulted in a virus recovery of 50% in the 0.6 M NaCl elution fraction. Minor amounts of virus eluted at higher salt concentrations of 1.2 and 2M NaCl (FIG. 5), whereas 42% of the loaded virus was found in the flow-through and wash fractions.",
                                "Due to a breakthrough of about 40-50% of the virus, DBC10% and DBC100% could not be reached. However, the sample application was not limited by binding capacity, but by pressure, as the pressure after an application of \u02dc5.9E+09 IU/cm2 exceeded the limits.",
                                "Considering the removal of impurities, no proteins could be detected in any of the SCMA fractions (flow-through, wash, elution/-s) obtained following SXC (pH 9) without or with preceding nuclease treatment, indicating a protein content below the assays' limit of detection (<25 \u03bcg/mL) and hence a virtually complete protein depletion (FIG. 4A for nuclease treatment+SXC (pH 9)+SCMA; Table 2 for both datasets). The overall DNA depletion was 90% following SXC (pH 9) and SCMA without a preceding nuclease treatment compared to the initial feed concentration before SXC (Table 2). The introduction of a nuclease digestion followed by SXC (pH 9) and SCMA resulted in an increased DNA depletion of above 99% compared to the initial feed concentration before nuclease treatment and SXC, leading to DNA concentrations of about 2 ng/mL at viral RNA titres of 3.5E+07 IU/mL (FIG. 4B, Table 2).",

                                "The DSP developed in this study consisted of clarification, ultrafiltration, nuclease treatment, and SXC and SCMA steps. While filtration-based clarification and concentration are commonly used initial process steps for the production of viral vaccines, a major rationale for using SXC for the virus capture was the predominant dependency on the size of the target species (Lee, J. et al. 2012). This promised an independence with regard to the specific HCV genotype and the robust depletion of smaller impurities. SCMA was selected for virus polishing, based on the heparin affinity of HCV (Fortuna, A. R. et al. 2019). Another benefit of the chosen methodology is the possibility to directly load the SXC eluent to the SCMA\u2014if necessary by an inline dilution.",
                                "Our data highlights the importance of avoiding a freeze-thaw cycle in a SXC elution buffer preceding SCMA, which resulted in a large decrease in recovery, possibly due to a degradation of HCV particles, or changes in the surface protein composition or structure. Although in general storage times using freeze-thaw cycles are unusual during a production process, this information may support similar trials in other laboratories.",
                                "With regard to virus recovery, no significant differences (according to a students' T-test, data not shown) were observed for samples that had been subjected to a nuclease treatment+SXC prior to SCMA (50% for 1a HCV) compared to samples that had been processed by SXC only prior to SCMA (63% for 1a HCV), with respect to the analytical error. Thus, SCMA appeared to be unaffected by a preceding nuclease treatment and independent of the virus genotype.",
                                "We observed a highly efficient protein depletion. Within the analytical error, a virtually full protein depletion could be achieved by SXC, with a protein removal of >99% for 1a HCV. Following SCMA for 5a HCV, protein levels were below the detection limit. The absence of protein in the SCMA flow-through and wash fractions may be caused by the sample dilution preceding the SCMA.",
                                "A comparable DNA depletion of at least 98% was achieved following a nuclease treatment, SXC, and SCMA. Of this overall DNA depletion, 5-12% were achieved by SCMA, whereas the nuclease treatment allowed an additional removal of about 10% of the total DNA. Most likely, the remaining DNA represents fragments attached to the virus as described above, or DNA being co-eluted with the virus particles using 0.6 M NaCl as SCMA elution buffer. For the latter, a further optimization of the SCMA procedure, including the evaluation of the virus elution using buffers with lower conductivity, is conceivable.",
