The vector contained enhanced, farnesylated green-fluorescent protein (eGFPf), which allows straightforward flow-sorting of infected or transfected cells, and a G418 resistance gene, which facilitates selection of infected or transfected cells. The eGFP gene of the retroviral vector pQCXIX\u00ae (Clontech) was replaced with eGFPf, and two copies of a Pol III-dependent H1-promoter cassette (from pSuper-Retro) were cloned into the inactivated long-terminal repeat of pQCXIX, to create the vector pQe2. In each H1-promoter cassette of pQe2, 2 unique restriction enzyme sites were incorporated to allow independent cloning of shRNA constructs into each cassette. pQe2 was used to knock down expression of proteins important in spindle-checkpoint function; both shRNA knockdown (by Western and other analyses) and eGFP expression have been validated. FIG. 12 depicts flow-cytometric analyses of the moderately infectable colon-carcinoma cell line DLD1 infected with pQe2. FIG. 13 depicts effective shRNA knockdown of eGFP itself using pQe2. Thus, expression of target genes can be knocked down by RNA molecules.

To maximize the chances of identifying effective shRNA sequences with even weak effects, interrogation of primarily 1 random shRNA per cell was thus performed. From the Poisson distribution, multiplicities of infection of 0.3 and 0.4 are associated with approximately 26% and 33% GFP positive cells, respectively, and associated with approximately 85% and 80% of GFP-positive cells being infected with only 1 shRNA-encoding construct, respectively.",

To enrich for true positives, the process of withdrawal and return to regular medium was repeated.

The cells were subjected to 1 round of IL-3 withdrawal and recovery and subjected to a second withdrawal from IL-3. After 15 hours, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, identifying infected cells by GFP fluorescence and dead cells by propidium iodide (PI) staining.

The improved survival with books 1 and 3 correlated with a decrease in caspase 3 enzymatic activity.

Differentiation can be detected by expression of marker proteins (e.g. Ter-119 or CD11b) or by morphological criteria (e.g. adherence to plastic).",

Cells that express both GFP (to confirm the presence of a vector) and the appropriate differentiation marker at levels higher than the highest evident in the control cells are \u201cgated on\u201d (selected). Differentiation of flow-sorted HL60 and U937 cells can be further confirmed by adherence of the cells to plastic.

The cell or cells in which the desired effect occurred are isolated, and using error-prone PCR, the sequence corresponding to that of the oligonucleotide at the top of FIG. 3 or FIG. 6 is amplified, e.g. by using perfectly matched primers that extend from the edge of the N28 sequence, plus one nucleotide on the downstream side (so that the 29th nucleotide in the final shRNA stem is mutagenized as well), all the way to the ends of the oligonucleotide sequence, this creates a library of \u201chalf-books.\u201d",

Although the selection assay described herein for FRDA cells is based on oxidant stress, this assay can also be used to obtain RNA molecules that improve aspects of FRDA cells unrelated to anti-oxidant defenses per se. The reason for this is that the selection assay is performed under oxidant stress conditions that allow survival of normal, control fibroblasts; therefore, an intervention that makes FRDA cells more like normal cells will, in another embodiment, improve survival in the assay. Some shRNA are found to affect the tri-nucleotide repeat expansion that inhibits frataxin expression, or the triplex DNA that is formed by the tri-nucleotide repeat expansion, which is measured by an increase in frataxin expression, either using Northern or Western blots.

Additional confirmation is performed by Western analysis, Northern analysis, and/or quantitative RT-PCR, in comparison with control shRNAs to rule out non-specific effects. Optional, final confirmation involves reversing the phenotype (rescue from oxidant stress, for example) by re-expressing the target gene with mutations that abrogate the shRNA effect but do not change the encoded amino acids.",
