    "title": "Modular pathway rewiring of Saccharomyces cerevisiae enables high-level production of L-ornithine",
    "date": "2015-09-08",
    "abstract": "Baker\u2019s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive cell factory for production of chemicals and biofuels. Many different products have been produced in this cell factory by reconstruction of heterologous biosynthetic pathways; however, endogenous metabolism by itself involves many metabolites of industrial interest, and de-regulation of endogenous pathways to ensure efficient carbon channelling to such metabolites is therefore of high interest. Furthermore, many of these may serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of complex natural products, and hence strains overproducing certain pathway intermediates can serve as platform cell factories for production of such products. Here we implement a modular pathway rewiring (MPR) strategy and demonstrate its use for pathway optimization resulting in high-level production of L -ornithine, an intermediate of L -arginine biosynthesis and a precursor metabolite for a range of different natural products. The MPR strategy involves rewiring of the urea cycle, subcellular trafficking engineering and pathway re-localization, and improving precursor supply either through attenuation of the Crabtree effect or through the use of controlled fed-batch fermentations, leading to an L -ornithine titre of 1,041\u00b147 mg l \u22121 with a yield of 67 mg (g glucose) \u22121 in shake-flask cultures and a titre of 5.1 g l \u22121 in fed-batch cultivations. Our study represents the first comprehensive study on overproducing an amino-acid intermediate in yeast, and our results demonstrate the potential to use yeast more extensively for low-cost production of many high-value amino-acid-derived chemicals.",

                        "Overall optimization of L-ornithine biosynthesis calls for perturbations of a large number of genes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1), and we therefore used a MPR strategy that was based on DNA assembly18 and modular pathway engineering (MOPE) methods4 that enabled efficient optimization of the overall pathway from glucose to L-ornithine. Hereby, the overall pathway from glucose to L-ornithine was re-cast into three modules as follows. Module 1: L-ornithine degradation or consumption module. When L-ornithine, which is synthesized in the mitochondria, is transported to the cytoplasm, subsequent reactions can transform it to L-citrulline or L-glutamate \u03b3-semialdehyde by ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC; ARG3) and ornithine aminotransferase (CAR2), respectively. The arginase reaction (CAR1) that degrades L-arginine into urea and L-ornithine was also included in this module (Supplementary Fig. 2); Module 2: L-ornithine synthesis module. This module contains all the reactions by which the TCA cycle intermediate \u03b1-ketoglutarate is converted to L-ornithine. Following L-glutamate transport into the mitochondria from the cytoplasm, five reaction steps convert it to L-ornithine. This cyclic L-ornithine synthesis pathway is the so-called acetylated derivative cycle because the acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the initial step is recycled from N-acetyl-L-ornithine generated in the fifth step (Supplementary Fig. 3); Module 3: \u03b1-ketoglutarate synthesis module. This module includes glucose uptake reactions (including its regulation), glycolysis and the upstream part of the TCA cycle. The respiratory chain, which is highly associated with the TCA cycle flux, is also included in this module (Supplementary Fig. 4).",
                        "Our MPR approach was initiated with engineering of the downstream Module 1 of L-ornithine consumption, and then the strain with the optimized downstream module was subject to upstream module optimization. Throughout the manuscript, strain names indicate the modules present in the strain33, for example, M1aM2bM3c includes strategy a for Module 1, strategy b for Module 2 and strategy c for Module 3. See Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for descriptions of all strains constructed in connection with pathway optimization."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "For L-arginine biosynthesis, L-ornithine is converted to L-citrulline by OTC (ARG3)31 in the cytoplasm after L-ornithine is exported from the mitochondria. The biosynthesis of L-ornithine is hereby controlled by the presence of L-arginine because of feedback inhibition and repression of the key enzymes34. Blocking the consumption pathway of target chemicals completely is a common strategy for accumulation of desired chemicals, and this strategy has been successfully applied for L-ornithine production by C. glutamicum, where the OTC-encoding genes were fully deleted2735. However, the entailed L-arginine auxotrophy of the resulting strains requires L-arginine supplementation, which might add costs and cause problems for large-scale operation. We therefore fine-tuned ARG3 expression rather than deleting the gene so that L-arginine can still be synthesized at low levels to support growth, and this will also limit any negative regulation of L-arginine on L-ornithine biosynthesis. We weakened ARG3 expression by replacing its native promoter with either the glucose-regulated HXT1 promoter (HXT1 encodes a low-affinity glucose transporter of the major facilitator superfamily) or the low-activity KEX2 promoter (KEX2 encodes a protein-processing Ca2+-dependent serine protease)3637 (Fig. 2a). Both strain M1a (HXT1 promoter) and M1b (KEX2 promoter) accumulated and secreted L-ornithine (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). While strain M1a produced 24\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 L-ornithine, strain M1b had a 76% higher titre of 42\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 2b). It is interesting that the intracellular L-arginine level only decreased \u223c30% compared with the control (Fig. 2c). It is apparent that the synthesis of L-arginine was to some extent maintained despite the low-level expression of ARG3. We speculated that the L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway was upregulated by the transcription factor Gcn4p (refs 24, 38) to alleviate decreased intracellular L-arginine levels following Arg3p downregulation, and this may have ensured L-arginine biosynthesis through the upregulation of genes in the L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Fig. 7).",
                        "L-ornithine can also be transaminated to L-glutamate \u03b3-semialdehyde by ornithine aminotransferase (Car2p), and L-glutamate \u03b3-semialdehyde can be further converted into L-glutamate in the presence of oxygen. Deletion of CAR2 may improve L-ornithine production by blocking this futile cycle. However, deletion of CAR2 in M1b (strain M1c) resulted in only a small increase in the L-ornithine titre to 45\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 2b). This small effect could be attributed to lack of a functional transaminase reaction at the low L-ornithine level (42\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121) in strain M1b. However, as the Car2p reaction may be activated when the whole pathway would be further improved for L-ornithine production, we thus used strain M1c harbouring the CAR2 deletion as the parent strain for the subsequent pathway optimization."

                        "After optimization of L-ornithine consumption, we set out to optimize Module 2 of the L-ornithine biosynthesis pathway from \u03b1-ketoglutarate. This part of L-ornithine biosynthesis is notable for its compartmentalization, where the key metabolites, such as L-glutamate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate and L-ornithine, are synthesized in different compartments. Thus, engineering of the specific biosynthetic pathway should be coordinated with the transport of these intermediates. To coordinate transport and biosynthesis of L-ornithine, we applied three different strategies. First, improving mitochondrial L-ornithine biosynthesis combined with engineering of transporters (Fig. 3a). Second, improving mitochondrial L-ornithine biosynthesis combined with translocation of L-glutamate biosynthesis to the mitochondria (Fig. 3b). Last, but not least, translocation of the entire L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3c).",
                        "The first two strategies involved overexpressing genes of the mitochondrial L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway from L-glutamate. As expected, overexpression of ARG5,6, ARG7 and ARG8 in strain M1cM2f resulted in an increased L-ornithine titre of 59\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a 31% increase compared with the control strain M1c (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 8). We also evaluated overexpression of each of the individual steps of the pathway to identify if a single enzyme should be flux-controlling, but single enzyme overexpression did not result in any improvement in titre over the M1c strain (Supplementary Fig. 9). This part of the pathway is the so-called acetylated derivative cycle, where there is cycling of the acetyl group. We speculated that if the level of acetylated intermediates is increased there will be a higher catalytic activity of the pathway, and we therefore also overexpressed N-acetylornithine synthase encoded by ARG2 resulting in strain M1cM2g producing 80\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 of L-ornithine, a 36% increase compared with parent strain M1cM2f (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 8).",
                        "We also evaluated overexpression of the positive regulator transcription factor Gcn4p (refs 24, 38) as an alternative strategy for overexpression of ARG5,6, ARG7 and ARG8 in the L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway. We used promoters of different strengths38 to fine-tune expression of a truncated version of GCN4 (tGCN4), in which the residues 99\u2013106 were truncated to circumvent rapid degradation of Gcn4p through the ubiquitin pathway38. However, there was no obvious difference in L-ornithine titre (Supplementary Fig. 10).",
                        "L-ornithine is exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol by Ort1p (ref. 39) where it is used for L-arginine biosynthesis. In the first strategy we therefore increased the expression level of ORT1 and when this was performed in the M1cM2g strain, resulting in strain M1cM2h, the L-ornithine titre increased to 115\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a 44% increase (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 8). Encouraged by these findings we also overexpressed AGC1, the gene encoding the glutamate uniporter/aspartate\u2013glutamate exchanger40, to ensure sufficient supply of L-glutamate for L-ornithine biosynthesis. By overexpression of AGC1 in strain M1cM2h, resulting in strain M1cM2k, L-ornithine titre increased to 149\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a further 30% increase (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 8). Both strategies point to that internal trafficking may often be rate-limiting in metabolic pathways, and overexpressing related transporters may be an efficient strategy for boosting the pathway flux to chemicals of interest.",
                        "Finally, as part of the first strategy we engineered L-glutamate biosynthesis in the cytosol. There are three pathways for L-glutamate biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. Two of these are mediated by the two isoforms of NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 and GDH3, while the third pathway involves combined activities of glutamine synthetase (encoded by GLN1) and glutamate synthase (encoded by GLT1)41. We overexpressed each of the three pathways in strain M1cM2k, resulting in strains M1cM2l (GDH1), M1cM2m (GDH3) and M1cM2n (GLN1 and GLT1). Of these targets, overexpression of GDH1 (strain M1cM2l) resulted in significant improvement in L-ornithine production, that is, a 16% increase in final titre corresponding to 173\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 3d). This indicates that Gdh1p, which generally is considered the key route for L-glutamate biosynthesis at ammonia access, is the most efficient one for L-glutamate biosynthesis, probably because of its high affinity for \u03b1-ketoglutarate42. Subsequently, to boost the cytoplasmic \u03b1-ketoglutarate pool for L-glutamate synthesis, we also overexpressed Odc1p that is reported to be responsible for \u03b1-ketoglutamate transport from mitochondria to the cytosol in strains M1cM2l and M1cM2m, respectively; however, this did not result in any substantial L-ornithine titre improvement (Supplementary Fig. 11).",
                        "In the second strategy, we relocated glutamate biosynthesis into the mitochondria by re-localizing the most efficient glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh1p. As Gdh1p is NADPH-dependent and mitochondria have low levels of NADPH, we also evaluated the re-localization of Gdh2p, which is NADH-dependent. Contrary to our expectations, mitochondrial re-localization of Gdh1p (strain M1cM2i) or Gdh2p (M1cM2j) decreased the L-ornithine titre significantly (Supplementary Fig. 12). The failure of this strategy may be attributed to either poor functioning of the glutamate dehydrogenases in the mitochondrial environment or to metabolite levels disfavouring these reactions in mitochondria.",
                        "As the third strategy, we took a different approach and re-localized the complete L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway to the cytosol, where the precursor L-glutamate is synthesized. We introduced a synthetic cytosolic L-ornithine pathway in strain M1cM2q, where the genes encoding the first two enzymes, argAEC and argBEc, were from E. coli and the other three pathway genes, argJCg, argCCg and argDCg, were from C. glutamicum, a very efficient producer of amino acids, including L-ornithine43. The successful growth complementation of an L-arginine auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strain with ORT1 disruption demonstrated that the cytosolic pathway was functional and could provide the precursor L-ornithine for L-arginine biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 13). Indeed, the strain M1cM2q had an 11% increase in L-ornithine production as compared with strain M1cM2l, resulting in a titre of 192\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 in shake-flask fermentations (Fig. 3d). As indicated in Supplementary Figs 14 and 15 and Supplementary Table 8, the specific L-ornithine titre (mg L-ornithine per g biomass) follows the same trend as that of the L-ornithine titre among the recombinant strains as there was no substantial variation in terms of biomass concentration obtained with the different strains.",
                        "These results demonstrated that re-localization of the complete pathway for L-ornithine biosynthesis into the cytosol was more successful for L-ornithine production than engineering the endogenous pathway."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "After efficiently channelling \u03b1-ketoglutarate towards L-ornithine, we set out to enhance \u03b1-ketoglutarate supply by optimizing Module 3, which involves the conversion of glucose to \u03b1-ketoglutarate. However, the optimization of this part is more difficult in S. cerevisiae because of the Crabtree effect, that is, the majority of carbon is channelled towards ethanol via aerobic fermentation32 when S. cerevisiae is grown aerobically at high glucose concentrations. The Crabtree effect hereby compromises carbon flux to the TCA cycle that provides \u03b1-ketoglutarate required for L-ornithine biosynthesis. To overcome this problem, we evaluated three different strategies. First, overexpression of TCA cycle genes involved in the biosynthesis of \u03b1-ketoglutarate (Fig. 4a). Second, improving consumption of NADH generated in connection with \u03b1-ketoglutarate biosynthesis (Fig. 4b). Third, attenuating glucose uptake rate and hereby reducing overflow metabolism to ethanol (Fig. 4c).",
                        "Previous studies showed that a low capacity of the TCA cycle contributed to the Crabtree effect44, and a comprehensive analysis of omics data indicated that the TCA cycle flux was to some extent controlled by phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and one mutation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 \u03b1 subunit Pda1p was found to bypass this regulation45. As part of the first strategy we therefore overexpressed both wild-type and mutated PDA1 (PDA1 [S313A]) to drive more flux to L-ornithine synthesis. In addition, we also overexpressed other genes that are involved in the conversion of pyruvate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, including one of the pyruvate carboxylase isomer-encoding gene PYC2, the citrate synthase-encoding gene CIT1, the aconitase-encoding gene ACO2 and the isocitrate dehydrogenase-encoding gene IDP1. The strain M1cM2qM3a, carrying the overexpression of PDA1, PYC2, CIT1, ACO2 and IDP1, had an L-ornithine titre of 245\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a 28% increase compared with its parent strain M1cM2q (Fig. 4d). By contrast, overexpression of the mutated mPDA1 together with overexpression of PYC2, CIT1, ACO2, IDP1 (strain M1cM2qM3b) only resulted in a slight increase in the L-ornithine titre of 264\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 4d) compared with strain M1cM2qM3a. The strains M1cM2qM3b and M1cM2qM3a exhibited approximately twofold L-ornithine/glucose yield as compared with the parent, whereas there was no substantial difference when compared with the control strain in terms of ethanol yield, biomass yield and maximum specific growth rate (Supplementary Table 8). Thus, with this strategy the Crabtree effect was not substantially alleviated; however, the metabolic flux towards \u03b1-ketoglutarate was apparently improved to some extent.",
                        "We previously showed that the Crabtree effect is partly due to a limited capacity of the respiration chain and that overexpression of NADH alternative oxidase (AOX) partly alleviated the overflow to ethanol32. We also found that AOX overexpression resulted in upregulation of almost every step of the TCA cycle, which may be beneficial for increasing the production of TCA cycle-derived chemicals, and this was supported by a previous proteomics study of an AOX-overexpressing strain46. We therefore overexpressed AOX from Hansenula anomala (HaAOX1) and also NDI1 encoding the endogenous NADH dehydrogenase, which mediates the delivery of electrons to the respiratory chain. Overexpression of HaAOX1 (strain M1cM2qM3c) resulted in an L-ornithine titre of 258\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a 35% increase as compared with the parent strain M1cM2q (Fig. 4d). Combined overexpression of NDI1 and HaAOX1 further increased L-ornithine production to 278\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 4d). These results indicated that overexpression of alternative NADH oxidase was an efficient strategy to boost the TCA cycle flux for the production of TCA cycle-derived amino acids. Interestingly, overexpression of HaAOX1 and NDI1 (strain M1cM2qM3d) increased L-ornithine production to the same level as boosting the TCA cycle's enzyme activity by direct overexpression of the related genes (strain M1cM2qM3b; Fig. 4d).",
                        "Although the two strategies described above had a positive effect on L-ornithine production, the Crabtree effect still caused low yields of L-ornithine on glucose, with ethanol being a major by-product. Previous work indicated a strong positive correlation between the Crabtree effect and glucose uptake rate during respirofermentative growth of S. cerevisiae44, and a recent study found that an internal deletion in the hexose transporter regulation protein Mth1p, encoded by MTH1-\u0394T, interfered with its degradation and caused a decrease in expression of these transporter proteins and hence a reduced glucose uptake rate47. As the third strategy, we therefore overexpressed MTH1-\u0394T (strain M1cM2qM3e) resulting in a remarkable fourfold increase in L-ornithine titre up to 778\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 (Fig. 4d). With MTH1-\u0394T expression there was also no ethanol produced; however, the glucose uptake rate was reduced to 0.2\u2009g glucose (g DCW)\u22121\u2009h\u22121, compared with the parent strain that had an ethanol production of 1.3\u2009g ethanol (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121 and a glucose uptake rate of 2.2\u2009g glucose (g DCW)\u22121\u2009h\u22121 (Fig. 4e). These results demonstrated that alleviating the Crabtree effect of S. cerevisiae was an efficient strategy to boost L-ornithine production at high glucose concentrations.",
                        "Low activity of \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (ODC), which catalyses the oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA in the TCA cycle, was found to be essential for glutamate overproduction in C. glutamicum48, and, inspired by this, we reasoned that ODC attenuation might redirect more TCA flux to the biosynthesis of L-ornithine. However, deletion of KGD2 encoding one of the components of the mitochondrial \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex decreased the L-ornithine titre by \u223c90% (Supplementary Fig. 16). Interestingly, the glucose uptake and the ethanol production rate of KGD2 deletion strain (Strain M1dM2qM3f) increased to 2.2\u2009g glucose (g DCW)\u22121\u2009h\u22121 and 0.9\u2009g ethanol (g DCW)\u22121\u2009h\u22121, respectively (Supplementary Table 7).",
                        "Clearly alleviation of the Crabtree effect has a positive effect on the L-ornithine titre and yield. Even though overexpression of MTH1-\u0394T was found to be an efficient strategy for alleviating the Crabtree effect in shake-flask cultures, it would be less attractive for industrial production as the strain has reduced growth. We therefore explored the possibility of alleviating the Crabtree effect by using an aerobic glucose-limited fed-batch strategy with strain M1cM2qM3a, whose upstream TCA cycle was enhanced as described above. This resulted in a final L-ornithine titre of 5.1\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 and a final DCW of 56\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 17)."

To further increase L-ornithine synthesis and reduce the L-arginine pool, which can cause feedback inhibition, we also overexpressed CAR1. As expected, overexpression of CAR1 in the strain M1cM2qM3e (resulting in strain M1dM2qM3e) enabled a final L-ornithine titre of 1,041\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121, representing a further 34% increase. This final strain has a 23-fold improvement in L-ornithine production compared with strain M1c (Fig. 4d). An early study showed that in the presence of L-arginine and L-ornithine, OTC (Arg3p) and arginase (Car1p), both trimeric proteins, can form the so-called \u2018epi-arginase' mode of regulation, that is, a one-to-one complex in which arginase remains active but OTC activity is inhibited31. This regulation prevents the formation of an L-ornithine futile cycle when the biosynthesis of L-arginine is repressed and the catabolism of L-arginine is activated31. We speculate that overexpression of CAR1 also possibly improved the \u2018epi-arginase' efficiency and the flux from L-ornithine to L-arginine was well controlled at a moderate level."

Extensive genetic perturbations therefore have to be implemented in a coordinated manner to achieve high-level production of desired chemicals, especially pathway intermediates. We demonstrated that a MPR strategy enabled a coordinated increase in flux towards L-ornithine. The MPR approach involved implementation of a large number of perturbations in the metabolism, ranging from the central carbon metabolism to the dedicated amino-acid biosynthetic pathway. Here we used a serial approach; however, recent advances in molecular biology tools for yeast and other eukaryotic organisms15174950 will enable concurrent tinkering of the many different pathway modules considered here.",
                "Enhancement of the precursor supply is a very common strategy in bacteria to increase the flux towards the desired amino acids134351. Yet, the segmentation of precursor intermediates in different subcellular organelles in S. cerevisiae hampers the plug and play use of such approaches5253. Thus, we tested a serial of customized approaches for yeast to improve precursor supply for L-ornithine synthesis. When we implemented Module 2, a substantial increase in L-ornithine titre was observed when the mitochondrial trafficking steps of L-ornithine and L-glutamate were enhanced by overexpressing the related proteins belonging to the mitochondrial carrier family, suggesting the mitochondrial subcellular trafficking often to be flux-controlling steps. However, when we implemented the overexpression of ODC1, which was suggested to encode one of the transporters responsible for the export of \u03b1-oxoglutarate and \u03b1-oxoadipate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol, where they are required for glutamate and lysine biosyntheses, the L-ornithine titre did not substantially increase. This could be due to a low level of \u03b1-ketoglutamate in the mitochondria; however, it may also be such that Odc1p is not a specific transporter responsible for the efflux of \u03b1-ketoglutamate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. Thus, while the identification of new mitochondrial carriers including the said \u03b1-ketoglutamate mitochondrial transporter in yeast will provide new insights into the physiological roles of mitochondrial carriers in cell metabolism, it would also allow for improved metabolic engineering.",

Owing to the concentration of enzymes and intermediates, reduction in toxic effects of certain intermediates and prevention in the diversion of precursor flux into competing pathways115354, re-localization of the metabolic pathways to the mitochondria was shown to be a useful strategy in metabolic engineering115354. However, in contrast to the substantial increase in L-ornithine titre when we introduced the bacterial acetylated derivatives cycle into the cytoplasm, targeting NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (Gdh1p) to the mitochondria markedly decreased the L-ornithine titre. These results highlight the importance of carefully choosing the re-localization strategy for metabolic engineering, and our results demonstrate that it may be better to express a heterologous bacterial pathway in the cytosol than to de-regulate the endogenous mitochondrial pathway. Similarly, one recent work showed that cytosolic pathway re-localization increased isobutanol production substantially in S. cerevisiae and also showed that further blocking of the parallel mitochondrial L-valine pathway, which generated the driving force for the cytosolic isobutanol pathway, resulted in even higher isobutanol production20.",
                "Although iterative engineering improved L-ornithine production to 192\u2009mg\u2009l\u22121 in strain M1cM2q, the L-ornithine yield on glucose was only 9.6\u2009mg (g glucose)\u22121; moreover, several studies reported similarly low yields on the carbon substrate212223 after metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae for production of chemicals, especially amino-acid-derived molecules. One of the main reasons is the Crabtree effect by which substantial carbon flux is redirected to ethanol production445556. Through optimization of Module 3, we showed that several different strategies worked and overexpression of a truncated form of MTH1, that is, MTH1-\u0394T, was the most successful one for increasing the L-ornithine yield as it generally alleviates the Crabtree effect even when the cells are grown at high glucose concentrations. However, the reduced maximum specific growth rate compared with that of the parent strain makes this strategy less attractive for large-scale process, where the Crabtree effect can be avoided through the use of fed-batch fermentations as also demonstrated here. Still, overexpression of MTH1-\u0394T for reducing the substrate uptake and the associated overflow metabolism is here demonstrated to be a useful strategy for evaluation of engineering strategies in shake-flask cultures.",
                "In conclusion, despite the complexity of the L-ornithine biosynthetic pathway, our results demonstrate great promise for engineering of yeast for production of amino acids using the MPR approach. The L-ornithine biosynthesis and regulation, pathway compartmentalization and overflow metabolism were systematically modified for L-ornithine overproduction. This first successful proof-of-concept of L-ornithine production in S. cerevisiae showed the potential to engineer other fungal microbial cell factories for production of amino acids and amino-acid-derived chemicals. In addition, our engineered strains and strategies described here should facilitate future engineering of complex biosynthetic pathways for production of different natural products derived from L-ornithine and even other amino acids intermediates."
