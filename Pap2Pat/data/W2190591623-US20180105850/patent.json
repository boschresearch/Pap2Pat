    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the provision of genetically modified microbial cells, such as yeast cells with an improved ability for producing L-ornithine and its derivatives. Overproduction of L-ornithine is obtained in the first place by the down-regulation or attenuation of specially selected genes, wherein said genes encode enzymes involved in the L-ornithine consumption and/or degradation pathways. Further L-ornithine production ability is improved by down-regulation, attenuation, deletion or overexpression of specially selected genes, wherein said genes encode enzymes and/or proteins involved in the L-ornithine \u2018acetylated derivatives cycle\u2019, L-glutamate synthesis pathways, subcellular trafficking, TCA cycle, pyruvate carboxylation pathway, respiratory electron-transport chain, and the carbon substrates' assimilation machinery. The invention additionally provides a method to produce L-ornithine with said modified eukaryotic cells.",

                        "L-ornithine, the intermediate of L-arginine biosynthesis, has already been widely used as a dietary supplement, as it is known to be beneficial for the treatment of wound healing and liver disease. Furthermore, it is also the precursor of bulk chemicals such as putrescine, an important diamine used as a nylon monomer, and natural products such as tropane alkaloids, which are used as parasympatholytics for competitively antagonizing acetylcholine.",
                        "L-ornithine is nowadays prepared by various processes, encompassing chemical synthesis and enzymatic catalysis. For instance, EP0464325A2 discloses an enzymic conversion process for the preparation of salts of L-ornithine from L-arginine in the presence of the enzyme L-arginase (EC 3.5.3.1.) extracted from animal liver. To reduce the cost of the enzyme, a whole-cell biotransformation system for the conversion of L-arginine to L-ornithine was also developed by constructing a recombinant Escherichia coli with overexpressed arginase (EC 3.5.3.1) encoding gene ARG from the bovine liver (Zhan et al. 2013). However, said whole-cell biotransformation system always has the problem of cell permeability, and addition of permeability reagent may lead to subsequent product separation problems. One idea has been to screen for a thermophilic enzyme, higher operation temperature could be used to improve the permeability of the recombinant cells. Arginase (ARG) from Bacillus caldovelox was found to be a potential thermophilic candidate (Patchett et al. 1991). Recently, the recombinant E. coli with B. caldovelox ARG gene was constructed, leading to an efficient and simple enzymatic process for the environment-friendly synthesis of L-ornithine from L-arginine (Song et al. 2014).",
                        "However, these methods either suffer from issues of expensive substrates, poor enantiopure purity or are environmental unfriendly.",
                        "Some L-citrulline or L-arginine auxotroph bacteria belong to the genus Brevibacterium, the genus Corynebacterium, the genus Bacillus and the genus Arthrobacter are known to produce L-ornithine. In addition, variants of said L-ornithine producing bacteria having resistance to arginine analogues and/or 2-thiazolealanine and/or sulfaguanidine and/or 2-fluoropyruvic acid and/or microphenolic acid and/or ornithinol are said to have better L-ornithine producing performance. Metabolic engineering frameworks, which offer the ability to leverage the advantages of biocatalysts (e.g. precision, specificity) and tailor the carbon flow of microbes, have enabled construction of platform cell factories for producing amino acids. Recent advantages in the said metabolic engineering also lead to the strain construction for L-ornithine production (Hwang and Cho 2012; Hwang and Cho 2014; Hwang et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2013a; Jiang et al. 2013b). For instance, WO 2012008809 A2 discloses a strategy to give the L-ornithine production at a high yield rate and with high efficiency by the fine-turning of gluconate kinase (GntK) in Corynebacterium. In another disclose, U.S. Pat. No. 8,741,608 B2 suggests that overexpressing of L-ornithine exporter is an efficient strategy to further improve L-ornithine titers. US 20140051132 A1 also discloses an invention where NCgl_2067-NCgl_2065 operon in Corynebacterium is/are attenuated lead to the improved production of L-amino acids belonging to L-glutamate family which includes L-ornithine. NCgl_2067-NCgl_2065 operon was suggested to encode negative regulators which directly controls expression of the related genes in the L-amino acids synthesis belong to L-glutamate.",
                        "However, one of the main drawbacks of L-ornithine production in bacterial strains is the phage contamination issues which often result in substantial economic losses. Thus, there is a need for better microbial strategies for the production of L-ornithine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine and other chemicals using these compounds as a precursor"

                        "Several unique features of Baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, including its robustness, GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status, excellent availability of molecular biology tools, wide use in industry, including large scale bioethanol production, and the more efficient ability to express complex enzymes such as cytochrome P450-containing enzymes, make it an attractive chasis host for production various chemicals. Furthermore, as S. cerevisiae is also widely used in brewing and baking industries, the L-ornithine producing yeast could represent a plug and play solution for the production of L-ornithine containing drinks and/or baking products or even other functional food products.",
                        "L-arginine biosynthesis is known for its compartmentalization in metabolism where L-ornithine, the precursor of L-arginine is synthesized in the mitochondria using L-glutamate as substrate which is produced in the cytoplasm. After transport to the cytoplasm, L-ornithine is converted to L-arginine after three consecutive steps. In addition, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, the precursor of L-glutamate is one of the intermediates of TCA cycle, the flux of which is limited by the so called \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 leading to the formation of ethanol as main byproduct. It is obvious that engineering S. cerevisiae to accumulate amino acids including L-ornithine remains a daunting task.",
                        "According to the above mentioned characteristics of L-ornithine metabolism, there are at least four challenges in constructing an L-ornithine over-producing yeast strain: (i) how to tune more metabolic flux stop at L-ornithine rather than toward L-arginine biosynthesis without incapacitating the ability of L-arginine synthesis, as sufficient L-arginine is necessary for cell growth; (ii) how to balance and coordinate the corresponding pathways and enzymes in different subcellular organelles, as pathway perturbation could create a substantial bottleneck due to membranes transportation of intermediates and these intermediates will be redirect to competing pathways; (iii) how to increase the supply of the precursor \u03b1-ketoglutarate, as \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 will limit the TCA cycle efficiency for \u03b1-ketoglutarate biosynthesis during normal batch fermentation with sufficient glucose; (iv) the total pathway optimization calls for intensive perturbations to the related pathways. How to implement the desired engineering strategies efficiently is yet to be demonstrated.",

The gene expressing modules consisted of a promoter, a structural gene, a terminator, and the promoter of the next module for homologous recombination. The promoter TEF1p, TDH3p, PGK1p and HXT7p, terminator FBA1t, CYC1t, TDH2t and ADH2t, were PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK.113-5D. The TPIp and the terminator pYX212t were PCR-amplified from plasmid pYX212. Genes ARG2, ARG5, 6, ARG7, ARG8, CIT1, ACO2, IDP1, PYC2, GLT1 and GLN1 were amplified from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK.113-5D. PDA1 and mutated mPDA1 were PCR-amplified from plasmid pRS416-PDA1 and pRS416-PDA1 [S313A] respectively (Oliviera et al., 2012).

The mutated MTH1-\u0394T was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae TAM (Oud et al., 2012). argBCg, and argJCg were targeted to the mitochondria using the N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal from subunit IV of the yeast cytochrome c oxidase (CoxIV) (Avalos et al., 2013). All modules were constructed with the one-step PCR strategy similar to overlap extension PCR. The expression modules were co-transformed by electroporation with linearized vector pYX212 or p423GPD into S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-11C, and the recombinants appeared on the corresponding plates after 2-4 days. Selected colonies formed on the plates were cultured in 5 mL of YPD liquid medium at 30\u00b0 C. for 72 h. Recovered plasmids were checked by PCR to verify the assembled pathways. Alternatively, positive plasmids were also transformed into E. coli DH5a, recovered, digested by the relative restriction endonuclease, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.

                                "As an intermediate of L-arginine biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae, L-ornithine can be converted to L-citrulline catalyzed by ornithine carbamoyltransferase (ARG3) in cytoplasm after export from the mitochondria, and L-ornithine biosynthesis rate is limited by the presence of L-arginine due to the feedback inhibition and repression of the key enzymes. However, deletion of ARG3 results in a L-arginine auxotrophy and a need of L-arginine supplementation, which adds additional costs and might take problems in large-scale process control. Thus, as part of this invention, we tested whether fine-tuning the ARG3 expression rather than full blocking would be a better strategy, as L-arginine can still be synthesized at controllable lower level to support the growth and also can limit the negative regulation of L-arginine on L-ornithine biosynthesis. Since promoter replacement can be a feasible strategy, we first weakened the ARG3 expression by replacing its native promoter with the promoter of HXT1 (Low-affinity glucose transporter of the major facilitator superfamily) and KEX2 (Ca2+ dependent serine protease involved in protein processing)(Scalcinati et al. 2012) (FIG. 1a). To replace the ARG3 promoter, the HXT1 promoter and KEX2 promoter were amplified from genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae strain CEN. PK113-5D by PCR. The DNA cassette including the new promoter, the kanMX cassette and both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 parts of the ARG3 promoter was constructed following the strategy of MOPE as described in Example 1 above. Following the transformation of these cassettes into S. cerevisiae, the correct transformants were selected and verified by colony PCR. This resulted in strains M1a (HXT1) and M1b (KEX2).",

The choice of promoter was also highly relevant to ornithine production, wherein the strain with the weakest promoter (KEX2) had a 75% higher titer (42 mg/L) compared to the strain with the HXT1 promoter (24 mg/L) as shown in FIG. 1b."

This part of L-ornithine synthesis is notable for its complicated metabolic compartmentation, where key metabolites, such as L-glutamate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate and L-ornithine, are synthesised in different organelle.

                                "CAR2 was initially deleted from strain M1b using a bipartite strategy (Erdeniz et al., 1997). Two overlapping fragments of the kanMX resistance marker cassette flanked by loxP sites were amplified via PCR from plasmid pUG6 (G\u00fcldener et al., 1996). Sequences upstream and downstream of CAR2 were also amplified. Due to overlapping ends (introduced through the primer sequences) the CAR2-upstream fragments could be fused to the 5\u2032 kanMX fragment and the 3\u2032 kanMX fragment to the individual CAR2-downstream fragments by fusion PCR using the outer primers for amplification. The two overlapping PCR fragments thus generated for each gene deletion were transformed into yeast using the lithium acetate method (Gietz and Woods, 2002). This resulted in the stain ORN-E(KanMX). The strain with the CAR2 deletion displayed a slight increase in ornithine production (FIG. 1b). Next, the genes ARG5, 6 (EC.1.2.1.38; 2.7.2.8; SEQ ID NO: 3), ARG7 (EC 2.3.1.35; SEQ ID NO: 5) and ARG8 (EC 2.6.1.11; SEQ ID NO: 4) were amplified from the genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK.113-5D and constructed into the GO1 plasmid according to MOPE strategy and DNA assembler as described in Example 1 above. The strain ORN-E(KanMX) was transformed with either two empty plasmids (pYX212 and p423GPD) yielding strain M1c, or with an empty URA-based plasmid (pYX212) and GO1 to yield strain M1cM2f.",
                                "Systematic overexpression of ARG5, 6, ARG7 and ARG8 in strain M1cM2f, increased L-ornithine titers to 59 mg l\u22121, representing a 31% increase as compared to the control (strain M1c)(FIG. 2d). This part of the pathway is known as the acetylated derivatives cycle because the acetyl group that is added to L-glutamate in the first step of the pathway is recycled via N-acetylglutamate generated in the fifth step. We speculated that if the activity of the first step which is catalysed by N-acetyl-ornithine synthase (NAGS, encoding by ARG2; EC 2.3.1.1) was increased, the further L-ornithine titers should improve. To overexpress ARG2 (SEQ ID NO: 2), this gene was amplified from the genome of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-5D strain and cloned into a plasmid together with ARG5, 6, ARG7 and ARG8 using the MOPE strategy, resulting in plasmid GO2. This plasmid was co-transformed into strain ORN-E(KanMX) along with pYX212, resulting in strain M1cM2g. This strain produced 80 mg l\u22121 of L-ornithine, leading to an 36% increasing as compared to the strain expressing only ARG5, 6, ARG7 and ARG8 (strain M1cM2f)(FIG. 2d). Indeed, while the ARG2 overexpression could improve the efficiency of initial step in the said L-ornithine pathway, it also fulfils an anaplerotic role to replenish the pathway intermediates that are lost due to degradation or cell division.",
                                "We also investigated whether overexpression of the transcription factor Gcn4p could improve L-ornithine production by up-regulation of corresponding genes such as above mentioned ARG5, 6, ARG7 and ARG8 in L-ornithine synthetic pathway. Thus, we used different-strength promoters to fine-tune expression of a truncated version of GCN4 (tGCN4), in which residues 99-106 were truncated to circumvent the rapid degradation through the ubiquitin pathway. No obvious difference was observed in the L-ornithine titers of most of these constructs, although overexpression of GCN4 using the GPD1 promoter did result in a 16% increase in ornithine titers after 24 h of cultivation (FIG. 8).",
                                "Distinguished from L-ornithine synthesis in bacteria, L-ornithine is first synthesised in mitochondria and then exported by Ort1p to the cytosol for L-arginine biosynthesis in yeast and hence we assessed whether increasing the expression level of ORT1 could further boost the L-ornithine titers. First, the KanMX gene was removed from strain ORN-E(KanMX) by introduction of Cre-recombinase-mediated recombination between the two flanking loxP sites using plasmid pSH47 as described previously (G\u00fcldener et al., 1996), followed by removal of pSH47 by plating of the strain on 5-FOA. The ORT1 (SEQ ID NO: 10) gene was then amplified from the genome of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK113-5D strain and integrated into the genome, resulting in strain ORN-F. This strain was co-transformed with pYX212 and GO2, resulting in strain M1cM2 h. This increased the L-ornithine titers to 115 mg l\u22121, representing a 44% increase as compared to the control strain (M1cM2g)(FIG. 2d).",
                                "We then engineered L-glutamate biosynthesis and its intracellular trafficking for precursor supply. We speculated that improving the internal L-glutamate trafficking step could increase the glutamate flux to further increase L-ornithine synthesis. Thus, the glutamate uniporter/aspartate-glutamate exchanger encoding gene AGC1 (SEQ ID NO: 11) was overexpressed in strain M1cM2 h as described above, and L-ornithine titers in resulting strain M1cM2k increased to 149 mg l\u22121, which was a 30% increase as compared to strain M1cM2 h (115 mg l\u22121) (FIG. 2d). Once again, the internal trafficking steps were proved to be rate limiting in metabolic pathways and overexpressing related transporters could be efficient to boost pathway flux to chemicals of interest. Beside the glutamate transportation, \u03b1-ketoglutamate transport from mitochondria to cytosol for glutamate synthesis was also enhanced by overexpressing the mitochondrial \u03b1-ketoglutamate exporter Odc1p (strain M1cM2o). However, we did not observe any substantial improvement in L-ornithine titers (FIG. 10). This result suggested that either the Odc1p could not efficiently export \u03b1-ketoglutamate or that the synthesis of \u03b1-ketoglutamate could be rate limiting.",
                                "After resolving the L-glutamate transportation, the L-glutamate biosynthesis might become limiting for L-ornithine overproduction. There are three pathways that contribute to L-glutamate synthesis in S. cerevesiae. Two pathways are mediated by two isoforms of glutamate dehydrogenase, encoded by GDH1 (EC:1.4.1.4; SEQ ID NO: 6) and GDH3 (EC:1.4.1.4; SEQ ID NO: 7), while the third one catalyzed by combined activities of glutamine synthetase (encoded by GLN1; EC:6.3.1.2; SEQ ID NO: 8) and glutamate synthase (encoded by GLT1; EC 1.4.1.14; SEQ ID NO: 9). We then overexpressed the three pathways separately in strain M1cM2k respectively, resulting strain in M1cM2l (GDH1), M1cM2m (GDH3) and M1cM2n (GLN1 and GLT1). Strain M1cM2l (overexpressing GDH1) displayed a further 16% increase in ornithine production, when compared to strain M1cM2k, and the final L-ornithine titer reached 173 mg l\u22121 (FIG. 2d). However, we could not see any further improvement when either GDH3 (strain M1cM2m) or GLN1 and GLT1 (strain M1cM2n) were expressed. These results indicated that Gdh1p is more efficient for synthesis of L-glutamate than Gdh3p and even the GS-GOGAT system.",
                                "The separated compartmentalization of metabolites should hinder the substrate channeling for consecutive enzyme catalysis. In our case, \u03b1-ketoglutarate (mitochondria), L-glutamate (cytoplasm) and L-ornithine (mitochondria) are synthesized in different organelles. Thus, re-localization of these steps into same organelle might be helpful for L-ornithine production. We first introduced the single cytosolic step of L-glutamate biosynthesis into mitochondria by re-localizing the most efficient glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh1p into mitochondria. Considering Gdh1p is NADPH dependent and mitochondria is not rich in NADPH, we also set out to target and overexpress Gdh2p (EC 1.4.1.2) which is NADH dependent, into the mitochondria. Though the reaction catalyzd by Gdh2p favours L-glutamate degradation, but not synthesis in S. cerevesiae, the high level of \u03b1-ketoglutarate and NADH in mitochondria might reverse the reaction towards L-glutamate synthesis from \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Contrary to expectations, mitochondrial re-localization of Gdh1p (strain M1cM2i) and Gdh2p (M1cM2j) decreased the L-ornithine titers significantly (FIG. 11). The lack of increase of L-ornithine production by mitochondrial Gdh2p targeting might be attributed to its role in L-glutamate degradation which reduced the availability of the precursor for L-ornithine synthesis, while the decrease of L-ornithine production in mitochondrial Gdh1p targeting might be caused by the absence of functional targeting, which even intervene in mitochondrial function.",
                                "We then alternatively re-localized L-ornithine synthetic pathway to cytosol, where the precursor L-glutamate is synthesized. We introduced a chimeric heterologous cytosollic L-ornithine synthetic pathway in strain M1cM2q, where the first two enzymes encoding genes argAEc(SEQ ID NO: 23) and argBEc (SEQ ID NO: 24) were from E. coli and other three enzymes encoding genes argJCg (SEQ ID NO: 27), argCCg (SEQ ID NO: 25) and argDCg SEQ ID NO: 26) were cloned from C. glutamicum. The successful complementation of L-arginine auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strain with ORT1 disruption (FIG. 12), demonstrated that the cytosolic pathway was functional to provide the precursor L-ornithine for L-arginine biosynthesis. We also observed that M1cM2q gave an 11% increase of L-ornithine, as compared to strain M1cM2l to 192 mg l\u22121 in shake flask fermentation (FIG. 2d). These results demonstrated re-localization of the complete pathway into the cytosol was helpful for L-ornithine production."

                                "After efficiently channelling \u03b1-ketoglutarate toward L-ornithine, we set out to enhance \u03b1-ketoglutarate supply pathway by optimizing Module 3. However, the optimization of this part will be more difficult in S. cerevisiae due to the notable \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019, i.e. the major carbon flux is channeled to ethanol via aerobic-fermentation when S. cerevisiae is growing exponentially on glucose aerobically. This \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 actually compromised the carbon flux to TCA cycle providing \u03b1-ketoglutarate during L-ornithine biosynthesis (FIG. 3a).",
                                "Previous studies showed that the TCA cycle flux was to some extent controlled by phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and that one mutation in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1 \u03b1 subunit Pda1p (EC1.2.4.1) can bypass the regulation (Oliveira et al. 2012). In this invention, we overexpressed both wild-type and mutated PDA1 to drive more flux to L-ornithine synthesis. In addition, we overexpressed the potential corresponding genes that catalyze steps from pyruvate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate, including one of the pyruvate carboxylase isomers encoding gene PYC2 (EC:6.4.1.1), citrate synthase encoding gene CIT1 (EC:2.3.3.16), aconitase encoding gene ACO1 (EC 4.2.1.3) and isocitrate dehydrogenase encoding gene IDP1 (EC 1.1.1.42). The strain M1cM2qM3a, carrying the overexpression of PDA1, PYC2, CIT1, ACO1 and IDP1, had L-ornithine titers of 245 mg 1-1, representing a 28% increase as compared to parent strain M1cM2q (FIG. 3d), and overexpression of mutated mPDA1 based on PYC2, CIT1, ACO1, IDP1 (strain M1cM2qM3b) just had a slight further L-ornithine increase to 264 mg l\u22121 (FIG. 3d) as compared to strain M1cM2qM3a. The detailed physiological investigation showed that M1cM2qM3b and M1cM2qM3a exhibited approximately 2-fold increased L-ornithine/glucose yield as compared to the parent, whereas there was no substantial difference when compared with the control in terms of biomass yield and maximum specific growth rate. The ethanol yield on glucose made no difference. These results demonstrated that the \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 could not be substantially alleviated by directly overexpressing the TCA cycle enzymes, but the metabolic flux of the TCA cycle could be improved at a smaller extent.",
                                "If the \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 was due to the limited capacity of the respiration chain and the overexpression of NADH alternative oxidase (AOX) substantially alleviated the overflow to ethanol and if AOX overexpression up-regulated almost every step of the TCA cycle, this may be helpful for increasing production of TCA cycle derived chemicals. We overexpressed AOX from Hansenula anomala (HaAOX1) and also ND/1 (SEQ ID NO: 21) encoding the internal NADH dehydrogenase, which mediated the delivery of the equivalents to the respiratory chain. The overexpression of HaAOX1 (strain M1cM2qM3c) enabled the L-ornithine titers to reach 258 mg l\u22121, representing a 35% increase as compared the parent strain M1cM2q (FIG. 3d). Furthermore, combined overexpression of NDI1 and HaAOX1 further increased L-ornithine production to 278 mg l\u22121 (FIG. 3d). These results indicated that NADH dehydrogenation was a rate limiting step in NADH oxidation, and overexpression of alternative NADH oxidase was an efficient strategy to boost the TCA flux for the production of TCA derived amino acids. It should be emphasized that the overexpression of HaAOX1 and NDI1 (strain M1cM2qM3d) increased the L-ornithine production to the same level as boosting the TCA cycle's enzyme activity by direct overexpression of related genes (strain M1cM2qM3b) (FIG. 3d).",
                                "Although aforementioned strategy had to some extent positive effect on L-ornithine production, the \u2018Crabtree effect\u2019 needed further alleviation. Overexpression of MTH1-\u0394T (strain M1cM2qM3e) increased L-ornithine titers up to 778 mg l\u22121 compared to the parent strain M1cM2q (FIG. 3d). It should also be emphasized that while the MTH1-\u0394T overexpression (M1dM2qM3e) strain produced no ethanol and had low glucose uptake of 0.2 g glucose (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121, the parent strain had ethanol production of 1.3 g ethanol (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121 and glucose uptake rate of 2.2 g glucose (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121 (FIG. 3e).

KGD2 down-regulation (Strain M1dM2qM3f) restored the glucose uptake of 2.2 g glucose (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121 and ethanol production of g ethanol (g DCW)\u22121 h\u22121 compared to the parent strain of MTH1-\u0394T overexpression.",

Early study showed that in the presence of L-arginine and L-ornithine, ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC, Arg3p) and arginase (Car1p), both trimeric proteins, can form the so-called \u2018epi-arginase\u2019 mode of regulation, i.e. a one-to-one complex in which arginase remains active but OTC activity is inhibited.

Our previous result showed that the strain with attenuated Arg3p still maintained \u2154 of the L-arginine intracellular concentration. It is speculated that overexpression of Car1p could enable even lower intracellular L-arginine. CAR1 overexpression (strain M1dM2qM3e) gave the final L-ornithine titers to 1041 mg l\u22121, representing a further 34% increase as compared to the parent strain M1cM2qM3e and 23-fold when compared with strain M1c (FIG. 3d).

First, the KanMX marker from ORN-L(KanMX) was looped out by introduction of Cre-recombinase-mediated recombination between the two flanking loxP sites using plasmid pSH47 as described previously (G\u00fcldener et al., 1996), followed by removal of pSH47 by plating of the strain on 5-FOA, resulting in strain ORN-L. Next, OAZ1 was deleted from ORN-L and CEN.PK113-11C using a bipartite strategy (Erdeniz et al., 1997). Two overlapping fragments of the kanMX resistance marker cassette flanked by loxP sites were amplified via PCR from plasmid pUG6 (G\u00fcldener et al., 1996). Sequences upstream and downstream of OAZ1 were also amplified. Due to overlapping ends (introduced through the primer sequences) the OAZ1-upstream fragments could be fused to the 5\u2032 kanMX fragment and the 3\u2032 kanMX fragment to the individual OAZ1-downstream fragments by fusion PCR using the outer primers for amplification. The two overlapping PCR fragments thus generated for each gene deletion were transformed into yeast using the lithium acetate method (Gietz and Woods, 2002). This resulted in strains PUT-A(KanMX) (expressing the ornithine pathway) and WT-PUT-A(KanMX) (not-expressing the ornithine platform). Subsequent transformation of WT-PUT-A(KanMX) with p426GPD and p423GPD resulted in strain WT-PUT1. PUT-A(KanMX) was transformed with plasmids p426GPD and GO4, resulting in strain PUT-1.",

SPE1 was amplified from S. cerevisiae (CEN.PK113-11C) genome (SEQ ID NO: 29) and placed under the control of TEF1 promoter and PRM9t terminator (Chen et al., 2012a) using fusion PCR procedures. The cassette was integrated to OAZ1 site of ORN-L and CEN.PK113-11C, resulting in strains PUT-B(KanMX) and WT-PUT-B(KanMX), respectively. WT-PUT-B(KanMX) was then transformed with plasmids p426GPD and p423GPD, resulting in strain WT-PUT2. PUT-B(KanMX) was transformed with plasmids p426GPD and GO4, resulting in strain PUT-2.",

To increase putrescine production by S. cerevisiae, the gene TPO1 (SEQ ID NO: 32) was amplified from the genome of S. cerevisiae (CEN.PK113-11C) using PCR.

                                "The resulting strains were cultivated in minimal media. In order to quantify polyamine production, samples were treated as follows: cultivation sample was prepared by taking 1 ml of liquid culture. Cells were spun down by centrifugation. The supernatant was directly used for derivatization. Cells were subject to Hot Water (HW) Extraction. This procedure was adapted from (Canelas et al. 2009). Tubes containing 1 ml of demineralized water were preheated in a water bath at 95-100\u00b0 C. for 10 min. Then, the hot water was quickly poured over the cell pellet; the mixture was immediately vortexed, and the sample was placed in the water bath. After 30 min, each tube was placed on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was directly used for derivatization. For the accurate measurement of polyamine concentration, samples were diluted, if necessary, to give polyamine concentration within the standard curve range. For derivatization, the procedure was adapted from (Kim et al. 2015). In brief, 0.25 ml of saturated NaHCO3 solution and 0.5 ml of dansyl chloride solution (5 mg/ml in acetone) were added to 0.5 ml of sample. Then the reaction mixture was incubated at 40\u00b0 C. for 1 h in the dark with occasional shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 ml 25% ammonium hydroxide. Samples filtered through a 25 mm syringe filter (0.45 \u03bcm Nylon) can be used for HPLC detection. The following chromatographic condition are used: C18 (100 mm\u00d74.6 mm i. d., 2.6 \u03bcm, Phenomenex Kinetex), excitation wavelength 340 nm, emission wavelength 515 nm, Sample injecting 10 \u03bcl, column temperature 40\u00b0 C., Detector sensitivity 7, acquisition starts at 3.4 min. The mobile phase is water and methanol with the speed of 1 mL/min. The elution program is as follows: 0-23 min 50% to 95% MeOH, 23-27 min 95% MeOH, 27-32 min 95% to 100% MeOH, 32-37 min 100% to 50% MeOH.",
                                "Both intracellular and extracellular putrescine levels were quantified (FIG. 15). Levels of putrescine significantly increased upon deletion of OAZ1, and increased further upon introduction of SPE1 (FIG. 15). Furthermore, strains engineered for increased ornithine production (strains PUT1, PUT2 and PUT3) produced significantly more putrescine compared to strains without any ornithine pathway modifications (FIG. 15), displaying the benefits of the ornithine platform for polyamine production. In addition, a slight increase in putrescine levels was observed for strains overexpressing the transporter TPO1 (FIG. 15).",

For example these comprise enhancing precursor supply (deletion of argI gene), inactivating putrescine degradation and utilization pathways (deletion of speG; puuPA, argR) and deletion of rpoS, a stress responsive polymerase sigma factor. Also genes coding for ornithine decarboxylase converting ornithine to putrescine and ornithine biosynthetic genes (argC-E) can be overexpressed either through plasmids or chromosomal integration.

For example the expression vector pTRC-LIC (Plasmid #62343; Addgene (Massachusetts, USA)) is used to systematically co-express the mentioned genes under control of the strong Ptrc promoter. Cloning is done via amplification of target genes through 30 bp overhang primers to the expression vector (Ptre promoter control) and carried out via the Gibson cloning approach (Gibson et al. 2009). Alternatively chromosomal replacement of promoters of these genes with a constitutive active strong hybrid-promoter like Ptrc can be performed.
