    "title": "An escalating dose study to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a Herpes Simplex Virus DNA vaccine, COR-1",
    "date": "2016-08-31",
    "abstract": "This paper describes a single site, open-label Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy volunteers of a herpes simplex polynucleotide vaccine that has previously been shown to enhance immunogenicity and protect against lethal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) challenge in mice. Five escalating doses of the vaccine, COR-1, were given by intradermal injection to HSV-1 and 2 seronegative healthy individuals. COR-1 was found to be safe and well-tolerated; the only vaccine-related adverse events were mild. While vaccine-induced antibody responses were not detectable, cell-mediated immune responses to HSV-specific peptide groups were identified in 19 of the 20 subjects who completed the study, and local inflammation at the immunisation site was observed. This study indicates COR-1 has potential to be used as a therapeutic vaccine for HSV-2 infection.",

                "Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted disease that results from infection of the genital mucosa with Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) or, increasingly, by infection with HSV type 1 (HSV-1).1-3 While for some the infection is mild, others experience frequent and debilitating outbreaks. Rarely, HSV infection can lead to encephalitis in newborn babies, or ocular disease (such as herpes stromal keratitis) and HSV infection is believed to facilitate the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1.4,5 While antiviral medications are available to reduce the duration and severity of the outbreaks, these drugs are expensive, cannot eliminate outbreaks or shedding, and do not prevent recurrence of lesions and the spread of disease. Despite a number of clinical trials of potential vaccines for genital herpes, none have been shown to effectively prevent herpes infection.6-8 Chiron's recombinant gB2/ gD2 subunit vaccine formulated with MF59 adjuvant, despite generating neutralising antibodies, was ineffective in reducing HSV-2 acquisition.9 Another recombinant subunit vaccine, GSK's gD2/ alum/ 3-O-deacylated-monophosphoryl lipid A vaccine showed initial promise as, while it did not prevent HSV-2 acquisition in men or HSV-1 seropositive women, it did reduce HSV-2 disease by 70% and HSV-2 infection by 40% in HSV-1 and -2 double seronegative women.10 Unfortunately, this finding was not replicated in a larger follow-up study 11 and the vaccine was only shown to have an effect on HSV-1 disease and acquisition.",
                "It is now understood that induction of high antibody titres alone is insufficient to prevent infection or the recurrence of lesions. Many studies indicate that cellular responses play an important role in preventing HSV-2 infection, reducing viral shedding, and producing a long-lasting memory response.12,13 This has been taken into consideration in the design of a therapeutic recombinant protein vaccine under development by Genocea Biosciences, GEN-003,14 and a polynucleotide vaccine by Vical.15 A Phase II dose optimisation trial of GEN-003 indicated that after 6 months the vaccine resulted in an up to 58 percent reduction in viral shedding and an up to 69 percent reduction in genital lesion rates, with 30\u201350% of patients lesion-free (unpublished; see press release http://ir.genocea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=935492). Vical's trial results have been less promising (http://www.vical.com/investors/news-releases/News-Release-Details/2015/Vical-Reports-Top-Line-Results-From-Phase-12-Trial-of-Therapeutic-Genital-Herpes-Vaccine/default.aspx). While there are live-attenuated vaccine candidates at various stages of development which could have prophylactic and/or therapeutic potential, they pose regulatory issues due to safety concerns.",
                "In this study, we have carried out a single site, open label Phase I clinical trial of a HSV-2 polynucleotide vaccine, COR-1, that was designed to induce specific antibody and T cell responses upon intradermal (ID) delivery and has previously been shown to provide protection against HSV-2 challenge in a murine model.16 The vaccine was delivered ID as it has been established in animal studies that, in general, less DNA is required to induce immune responses when it is delivered ID than when it is delivered intramuscularly. This is probably due to the large concentration of relevant immune cells in the dermis relative to the muscle. Delivery of vaccine doses adequate to induce immune responses when delivered to muscle would not be achievable using a simple needle and syringe approach, other delivery methods and/or adjuvants would be required (e.g. electroporation).",
                "Our vaccine uses a different approach to inducing a balanced immune response than those discussed above. COR-1 is a 1:1 mixture of 2 plasmids which carry codon-modified gene sequences that encode full-length glycoprotein D from HSV-2 (gD2) and ubiquitin-fused truncated gD2 and were optimized to generate an immune response to a polynucleotide vaccine delivered intradermally (ID) in mammals. The ubiquitin-encoding sequence was included to target the antigen to the proteasome for processing and to enhance cytotoxic T cell responses.",
                "The primary objective of this initial trial was to examine the safety and tolerability of ID injection of 5 escalating doses of COR-1 in healthy individuals that were seronegative to HSV-1 and 2. Secondary and tertiary objectives of the study included determining whether the vaccine induces the production of anti-HSV gD2-specific antibodies and to provide information that may lead to the prediction of an optimised dose of COR-1 for induction of an efficacious immune response to protect against future HSV infection. Exploratory objectives were to determine whether resulting anti-HSV gD2 antibodies are neutralising and to determine whether COR-1 induces a cell-mediated immune response."

In line with this, no neutralising antibody responses to HSV-2 were detected in any subjects. The incidence and size of post immunization erythema at the reaction site was greater in the 100\u00a0\u03bcg, 300\u00a0\u03bcg and 1\u00a0mg COR-1 treatment groups than in the lower dose treatment groups (Fig.\u00a02). No erythema was detected in subjects receiving 10\u00a0\u03bcg COR-1. Furthermore, erythema sizes were greater 2\u00a0days after vaccination than 1\u00a0day, as would be expected with a delayed type sensitivity reaction. Interestingly, all but one subject had pre-existing cellular immune responses measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT to more than one peptide pool of gD2 despite being tested sero-negative (Fig.\u00a03A). These responses were most commonly to peptide pools 11\u201315 and 21\u201325 (which contain known gD2 CD4 epitopes17 , and pools 1\u20135, 31\u201335 and 46\u201350.

We determined that a minimum of 2-fold increase in the mean spot value compared to pre-existing responses measured at Visit 1 in at least one peptide pool and at least one visit after vaccination would be regarded as a vaccine-related response. We concluded that 19 out of 20 patients had mounted a vaccine-related cellular immune response (Fig.\u00a03B). Interestingly, a large proportion of subjects had responded to either peptide pools 11\u201315 or 21\u201325. We did however not observe a dose-dependent cellular response. Figure 3.Pre-existing and vaccine-related cellular responses measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT. (A) Pre-existing responses to the gD2 peptide were determined using PBMCs taken at Visit 1 before the first vaccination. Responses were determined positive if X-(SD of X) \u2013 Y-(2xST of Y) > 10 (X: mean spot value; Y: mean spot value of no peptide control wells). (B) Number of subjects that were classified of having mounted a vaccine-related cellular immune response to gD2. Vaccine related positivity was accepted when the mean spot value was increased at least 2 fold compared to pre-existing responses in at least one peptide pool and at least one visit after vaccination.",
                        "As measurable ELISPOT responses to HSV-2 peptides were seen in supposedly HSV na\u00efve subjects, we further analyzed the gD2-specific ELISPOT data to establish the extent to which the observed increase or decrease in ELISPOT frequency post vaccination to each peptide pool was non-randomly biased toward an increase with vaccination (Table\u00a04). As the range of changes were not Gaussian in distribution, with or without log transformation, the median change at each time point was assessed for each peptide pool, as well as the number of subjects for which an increase or decrease was seen. The results show that only peptide pool 21\u201325 induced significant change in ELISPOT count with immunisation across all peptide pools, and only at the first visit post immunisation (Table\u00a04). 17 of 20 subjects responded positively to this peptide pool.

                "A large number of DNA vaccines have undergone clinical trial and their general safety demonstrated.18 Consistent with those studies, this Phase I clinical trial clearly demonstrates that 3 intradermal immunizations with COR-1 is safe and well-tolerated in humans at doses up to 1\u00a0mg, with no vaccine-related moderate or severe TEAEs or SAEs observed. As erythema at the site of administration was mild, it is not a cause for concern. In addition, the vaccine did not generate anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, which in theory could be a potential damaging side-effect of DNA vaccine administration, causing problems similar to those seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. The injection site hyperpigmentation observed in the highest dose group should fade over time and is also therefore unlikely to be a cause for concern.",
                "Meeting a secondary goal of the study, the vaccine was shown to be immunogenic, giving rise to dose-dependent inflammation seen as erythema which was not due to the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies, and generating measurable gD2 antigen-specific cellular immune responses. The lack of anti-gD2 antibodies, in contrast to previous studies in mice,16 might reflect the relative low dose of vaccine given to subjects compared to the relatively high doses used in mice. The maximum dose of 1\u00a0mg roughly equates to a dose of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg in mice. In a previous study, we showed that a high dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg led to high and reproducible antibody titres in mice. When a low 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg dose was delivered twice, 2 weeks apart, to mice we found measurable levels of antibodies only in a minority of mice despite 70% of these mice surviving 50x LD50 HSV-2 viral challenge, indicating that clinical efficacy can be achieved with a low dose vaccination regime.16",
                "It might also reflect the general difficulty of generating antibody responses to DNA vaccines in humans which has been noted in numerous clinical studies.19-21 Inflammation is rarely seen in response to DNA vaccine administration in humans, particularly if the vaccine is administered using a needle and syringe and no non-DNA boost, such as recombinant protein antigen or an adenoviral vector-based vaccine, is given.20 It is possible that the inflammation is in part due to the mode of delivery as a recent clinical trial comparing vaccine given IM and ID indicated that while ID resulted in more inflammation at the injection site than IM, the measured immunogenicity resulting from the 2 sites was similar.22 Of course, simply because the assays carried out in that study did not identify differences in humoral response does not mean there were none.",
                "While it is disappointing that the vaccine did not generate detectable antibodies, it is remarkable that CTL responses were measured to at least one peptide pool in all but one of the subjects that received the full complement of vaccinations. As little as 10\u00a0\u03bcg of COR-1, delivered 3\u00a0times for a total dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg, was sufficient to generate a measurable response. This result is of particular interest as, to our knowledge, needle and syringe delivery of a DNA vaccine has not consistently given rise to measurable cellular responses in humans at such a low dose. Few studies have examined the immune response to DNA vaccines delivered intradermally using a needle and syringe and without a recombinant protein or virus boost. Ledgerwood et\u00a0al. 23 showed that 500\u00a0\u03bcg of plasmid DNA encoding an avian flu antigen, delivered 3\u00a0times, generated T cell responses in 20% of subjects. The only published studies which have delivered low doses (1\u20138\u00a0\u03bcg DNA) of plasmid DNA to the skin (and without protein/virus boosts) have used special delivery technologies, such as Particle Mediated Epidermal Delivery (PMED) 24 and are therefore not comparable with the present study.",
                "The observed pre-existing responses to the HSV-2 gD peptides in all but one subject are interesting: while the subjects were all seronegative to HSV-1 and 2 by standard pathology testing and by further testing in a specialist HSV research laboratory, it seems likely that their immune systems had previously encountered the herpes simplex virus. It is possible that they were reacting to epitopes that just happen to be in the gD peptide sequences but are actually also present in another unrelated antigens. However, given that the responses were not restricted to one peptide pool, it seems unlikely that this is the case for all of the responses. This raises the possibility that the 19 subjects with pre-existing CTL responses are actually infected with HSV, most likely orofacial HSV-1, or that they have been exposed to, but have successfully resisted infection with or persistence of, the virus.",
                "Immune correlates of protection for a HSV vaccine are not well-defined. Presumably, for COR-1 to be effective as a prophylactic it would need to be optimised in some way, such as by increasing the dose, or by modifying the dosing regimen or vaccine design, so that in addition to a cellular response, it induces the production of neutralising antibodies. Determination of an optimal dose of COR-1 to protect against future HSV infection is therefore unachievable from this study. However, the vaccine shows promise as a therapeutic vaccine as it is able to consistently generate cellular responses even at low doses. The generation of a T cell response is thought to be prerequisite to limiting recurring outbreaks, lesions and viral shedding, which could enhance life quality of infected individuals and also limit viral spread. This information, together with the safety data and the post hoc analysis of the injection site photographs, has been used to predict an optimised dose of COR-1 to potentially treat existing HSV infection. A blinded, placebo-controlled, dose escalation Phase I/IIa study of COR-1 in HSV-2 seropositive and symptomatic subjects that will primarily assess the safety and tolerability of the vaccine and its effect on viral load commenced in late 2015."

                        "Cells were incubated with stimulants at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 16 to 20\u00a0hours. Plates were washed 6\u00a0times in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). For detection, biotinylated detection monoclonal antibody (7-B6-1; Mabtech) in PBS-T/0.5% FCS was added, followed by horseradish peroxidise (HRP)-conjugated strepavidin (Mabtech) and DAB substrate (Sigma). Plates were dried and spots were quantitated using an AID-ELISpot Reader System (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Germany).",
                        "A response was considered positive when the mean of the spots counted in a particular peptide pool (X) minus the corresponding standard deviation (SD) was higher than 10, after the mean of the no peptide wells (Y) minus 2\u00a0times the SD was subtracted i.e., X-(SD of X) - Y-(2x SD of Y)> 10. This method combines the \u2018empirical approach\u2019 and recommendations from the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium (formerly the Cancer Vaccine Consortium) http://www.cancerresearch.org/cic.",
                        "If a subject had pre-existing cellular immunity to HSV despite being sero-negative at screening, a 2-fold increase in the mean triplicate spot forming units (SFU)/well by or at Visit 10 compared to the Visit 1 result was considered treatment-related."
