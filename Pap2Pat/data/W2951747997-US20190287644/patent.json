Responses can be objective (quantitative) or subjective (qualitative). The method can identify relevant genes as genes whose expression fold-change have a statistically significant correlation (e.g., determined by randomization of gene expression and phenotypic data) to the fold-change of the scalar quantity characterizing the change of phenotype.

Understanding which genes are involved and how they affect diseases is a major challenge for designing appropriate therapies.",
                                "Heart failure (HF) is a well-studied example of a genetically complex disease involving multiple processes that eventually lead to a common phenotype of abnormal ventricular function and cardiac hypertrophy. Numerous studies have attempted to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to find biomarkers for the prognosis of the disease and the design of appropriate drugs, as well as explore underlying affected signaling pathways. Such studies typically compare the average gene expression between samples in healthy and diseased states, such as non-failing versus failing hearts in murine, canine, or human samples. Genes are ranked by the strength of their differential expression, and top-ranking genes are further investigated for pathway enrichment and biomarker potential. However, because of the different genetic backgrounds of the surveyed individuals, as well as different severities of HF, those studies show very limited overlap of DEGs. While separate studies typically identify tens to hundreds of DEGs, not a single DEG is common to all studies. Moreover, it is unclear whether the healthy state is itself a well-defined unique state. In particular, several studies have shown that, due to compensatory mechanisms involved in homeostasis, different combinations of ion channel conductances in neurons and cardiac cells can lead to a normal electrophysiological phenotype, e.g., a similar bursting pattern of motor neurons or a similar cardiac action potential and calcium transient. This has led to the concept that genetically distinct individuals represent different \u201cGood Enough Solutions\u201d corresponding to distinct gene expression patterns underlying a healthy phenotype. Different combinations of gene expression in a healthy state resulting from genetic variations would be expected to yield different DEGs in a diseased state. Thus, small numbers of DEGs that are only shared by a subset of individuals, and would be missed by a standard population-wide DEG analysis, could in principle have a causal role. Identifying these genes remains a central challenge in personalized medicine.",
                                "In order to explore the variability of individual trajectories leading to hypertrophy and HF, the following leverages the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), a model system consisting of >100 genetically diverse strains of mice (see Methods, below). Gene expression and phenotypic data are acquired before and three weeks after implantation of a pump delivering isoproterenol (ISO). This pathological stressor induces a global response characterized mainly by cardiac hypertrophy along with more marginal changes in chamber dilation and contractile function at the population level. As a result, primary focus was on the identification of genes relevant for cardiac hypertrophy. Expression data is collected at the whole heart level and the Total Heart Weight is used to quantify the degree of cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, the severity of the hypertrophic response is highly variable among strains, ranging from almost no hypertrophy to up to an 80% increase of heart mass. The study is directed at understanding why certain individuals are more susceptible to or protected against cardiac hypertrophy due to their genetic backgrounds. Because mice from the same strains are isogenic and renewable, the HMDP offers the possibility to analyze differential gene expression and phenotype evolution in a unique setting where subjects in the control population can be matched to a subject with the same genetic background in the diseased populations. In that setup, one can correlate the stressor-related gene expression change with phenotype change (in the example case, heart mass increase) while controlling for genetic background, thereby disentangling intra-strain (stressor-induced) and inter-strain (genetics-induced) variations. In the specific case of HF which is the focus in this example, such data could not be obtained in human studies where heart tissue biopsies are extracted from either healthy donor hearts or explanted hearts of late stage HF patients in a genetically diverse population. One would indeed require a population of identical twins in which one twin for each pair of twins is a heart donor and the other twin is a late stage HF patient. As such, gene expression data obtained from those biopsies can only be used to perform a population-level differential gene expression analysis. In contrast, relevant genes are identified by correlating strain-specific temporal changes of gene expression, i.e., differential expression between a post-ISO mouse and another pre-ISO mouse from the same strain, with the corresponding strain-specific changes of phenotype, i.e., ratio of heart mass between the post- and pre-ISO mice of the same strain.",
                                "Concretely (see Methods, below), the Pearson coefficient of correlation c1 are calculated between the strain-specific fold-change of expression of gene j among N different strains",
                                "\\({F_{j} = \\left( {\\frac{E_{1}^{\\prime}\ue8a0(j)}{E_{1}\ue8a0(j)},\\frac{E_{2}^{\\prime}\ue8a0(j)}{E_{2}\ue8a0(j)},\\ldots \ue89e\\mspace{14mu},\\frac{E_{N}^{\\prime}\ue8a0(j)}{E_{N}\ue8a0(j)}} \\right)},\\)",

This method of differential gene expression analysis identifies a set of DEGs, referred to hereafter as \u201cfold-change\u201d (FC) genes, for which the absolute value of cj is above a threshold of statistical significance determined by randomization of the data as detailed further in Methods, below. The ability to study a large number (N\u02dc100) of strains using the HMDP is essential to have enough statistical power to establish such a correlation, a power that has been lacking from previous studies limited to small numbers of strains. Moreover, the correlation coefficients cj cannot be calculated in the setting of traditional clinical studies since the fold change of gene expression or heart mass of subjects with different genetic background is meaningless. Conversely, it is possible to analyze the HMDP data set using the same type of population-level differential gene expression analysis used in clinical studies, such as SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays). Applied to the HMDP data set, a method like SAM identifies a gene j as differentially expressed if the expression data in the control population (E1 (j), E2 (J), . . . , EN(j)) and the treated population (E\u20321(j), E\u20322(j), . . . , E\u2032N(j)) originate from different distributions. Comparing those two distributions is fundamentally different than calculating the correlation coefficients cj between Fj and Fm.",
                                "Based on the computation of the cj correlation coefficients, a small set of 36 FC genes are found and compared to a larger set of genes identified with SAM (referred to hereafter as SAM genes). Interestingly, the sets of FC and SAM genes have negligible overlap. The FC genes are not identified as significantly changed at the population level because they typically have opposite fold changes in low and high hypertrophy strains that cancel each other when averaged over all strains in the population-wide case. It is shown that the FC genes are strongly enriched in cardiac disease genes from previous Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), while SAM genes are in contrary enriched in fibrosis genes. It is also shown that those two sets form two distinct communities in the co-expression network among healthy as well as ISO-injected strains, and potential Transcription Factors (TFs) to explain the observed co-regulation of FC genes are identified. Moreover, it was found that the proteins encoded by the FC genes, but not the SAM genes, interact predominantly with proteins belonging to a cardiac hypertrophic signaling network (CHSN) that has been shown to provide a predictive model of hypertrophy in relation to multiple stressors including ISO. Interestingly, it was found that one of the FC genes, namely Hes1, is also a predicted TF and an important interactor with the CHSN. Using a knockdown approach, it was found that it plays a major role in cardiac hypertrophy, allowing us to validate the personalized, multi-omics approach.",
                                "Results",
                                "1. Two Types of Responses to Stressor-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy and Heart Failure",
                                "One example shows two distinct ways to describe the response to ISO in the HMDP (see FIG. 1A-1G and Methods). First, it is noted that ISO induces a global response across all strains, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. This is seen in FIG. 1A, where the distribution of heart mass among the post-ISO strains can clearly be distinguished from the pre-ISO distribution (p<2.2e-16 under Student t-test). At the gene level, such a response is typically analyzed by looking for DEGs at the population level, i.e., genes for which the change in average expression with the stressor is significantly greater than the variability with and without the stressor (see FIG. 1B). Typical tools include t-test, SAM, or LIMMA. Genes found with these methods have a differential expression profile at the population level and are therefore potential biomarkers of the trait of interest (see microarray data for Serpina3n, ranked #13 by SAM, in FIG. 1C). However, despite the global response in the level of gene expression to ISO, the degree of hypertrophy among individual strains is highly variable, from almost none to an 80% increase of heart weight (see FIG. 1D). This calls for an evaluation of the strength of differential gene expression at the individual level. In particular, a whole new class of genes becomes available for analysis. Indeed, even if a gene does not show population-wide average differential expression, it can show extensive variation at the individual, strain-specific level (see FIG. 1E). This is the case for the gene Kcnip2 encoding the protein KChIP2, which interacts with pore forming subunits (Kv4.2 and Kv4.3) of the transient outward current Ito expressed in heart, and which has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. Though not showing population-wide differential expression (see FIG. 1F), its individual fold-change of expression can vary drastically from 2-fold decrease to a 2-fold increase depending on the considered strain (see FIG. 1G). Interestingly, when comparing the individual variations of those two types of genes with the degree of hypertrophy (see FIGS. 1H-1K), it can be seen that global DEGs are not necessarily good descriptors of the individual changes of phenotype (see FIG. 1J), unlike the second type of genes missed by a traditional population-wide method (see FIG. 1L). In particular, in the case of Kcnip2, a significant positive correlation with the severity of hypertrophy (r=0.4, p=1.5e-4) was observed. This is particularly interesting since Kcnip2 has previously been shown to be down-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy in the strain 129X1/SvJ. While this finding was confirmed, it was also observed that it is unusual in a broader context, and that Kcnip2 is most of the time up-regulated in strains with marked hypertrophy.",
                                "In the following, these observations are generalized to identify a larger set of genes that, like Kcnip2, have an individual FC correlated to the severity of hypertrophy, and this set was compared to the complete set of DEGs identified by the population-level SAM method.",
                                "2. Identification of Genes Associated with the Severity of Hypertrophy",
                                "Described herein is an example method to determine which genes show individual, strain-specific expression FCs significantly correlated to the individual hypertrophic response measured by the individual fold-change of heart mass. Since the methodology is based on correlations, those genes are selected that belong to the giant component of the gene co-expression network above a certain correlation cutoff (see Methods, below). The advantages of such a filter compared to one based on absolute expression levels is that it yields a clear, well-defined cutoff while also rejecting genes having high expression but artefactual correlations (e.g., hitting a microarray saturation level). Obtained is a filtered set of 11,279 high-confidence genes. Then, the absolute Pearson correlation is computed for all genes between the gene expression fold-change and the individual hypertrophic response (see FIG. 2A, blue histogram). To control for false positives, the expected correlations when randomizing the phenotype by shuffling strain labels are computed (see Methods and FIG. 2A, red histogram). One can see significant enrichment in genes with high correlation to the trait. To quantify this enrichment, the proportion of observed (\u2018blue\u2019) correlations divided by the proportion of correlations in the randomized cases (\u2018red\u2019) above various correlation cutoffs can be computed. FIG. 2B shows this enrichment as a function of the gene rank, ordered by decreasing absolute value of the correlation with hypertrophy. The enrichment shows a peak at 36 genes, followed by a plateau until about 500 genes, and a subsequent decrease. These 36 genes can be defined as candidates to describe the hypertrophic spectrum. These genes are listed in Table 1, along with references supporting the involvement of several of them in cardiac hypertrophy and HF. In the following, this set of genes is referred to as the \u201cFC\u201d set.",
                                "As a comparison, the population-wide DEGs using Significance Analysis of Microarray or SAM was computed. This exhibited 2,538 DEGs at a False Discovery Rate of 1e-3 (see Methods, below). Interestingly, no significant overlap (p=0.68, hypergeometric test) was found between these SAM genes and the FC set, with six genes common to both sets (Tspan17, Ppp1r9a, Bclaf1, AW549877, Gss, 2310022B05Rik and 9430041O17Rikm). In general, correlations between the individual fold-changes of the SAM genes and the degree of hypertrophy are found to be quite low (see FIG. 2C). This shows that population-wide analyses do not naturally yield personalized FC genes, calling for a specific method to uncover them.",
                                "The 36 FC genes are shown in FIG. 2D. As expected from the absence of overlap with SAM genes, the FC genes have both negative (blue) and positive (red) fold-change across the different strains, meaning that they have negligible average fold-change at the population level. A question that arises is whether the variability observed in the individual fold-changes of gene expression across strains is a consequence of genetic variability, or merely reflects environmental or experimental spurious effects. To investigate this question, the fact that gene expression has been replicated in 9 strains post-ISO can be leveraged. Since mice from the same strain have a similar genetic background, they should therefore show very comparable individual fold-changes. The replicability was assessed by computing the Spearman rank correlation of the 36 FC genes fold-change profiles between mice from replicated strains. A large mean correlation of 0.76 was found, compared to 0.14 for pairs of strains taken at random among the non-replicated pool with a statistically very significant p-value (p=1.6e-7, Wilcoxon test). This result shows that individual fold-changes are tightly controlled at the genetic level and that the ranking of the genes by FC is preserved for approximately \u2154 of the cases. Replicability was also assessed by making a scatter plot of the log 2 expression fold-change computed with the original and replicated ISO treated hearts compared to the same control heart for the 36 FC genes and 9 strains. A correlation analysis of this scatter plot yields a correlation of 0.57 and very low p-value (p<2.2e-16), confirming that individual fold-changes are predominantly genetically determined.",

                                "3. Biological Relevance of the Identified FC Genes",
                                "Given the importance of the genetic control of those genes, they must be more susceptible to genetic variations. To explore that idea, the enrichment in disease genes coming from previous GWAS can be evaluated. The HuGE database of human genes associated with 2,711 different diseases can be used (see Methods, below). First, the mouse gene names are converted to human as described in Methods. Then, the diseases are ranked according to their enrichment in 36 FC (resp. 36 best SAM) genes using a hypergeometric test assuming as null hypothesis a uniform repartition of the genes across diseases. Results are shown in FIGS. 2E and 2F for the 15 most enriched diseases in each case. It was observed that FC genes are strongly enriched in heart diseases (11 in the 15 most enriched diseases) while SAM genes are only enriched in two cardiac diseases and in fibrosis, a feature characteristic of the structural remodeling taking place during HF. Those findings exhibit two distinct roles of FC and SAM genes in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. While the cross-talk between cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes during cardiac hypertrophy has been studied previously, here, their relative contributions are disentangled into a shared, population-wide fibroblastic component, and a fine-tuned, individualized component capable of explaining the severity of cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, the enrichment of FC genes in human GWAS genes also highlights the relevance of the present HMDP data analysis to human cardiac hypertrophy and HF.",
                                "4. Co-Expression and Co-Regulation",
                                "The identified sets of population-level and individual FC genes have until now been considered as collections of independent genes. However, in the cell, genes function together to achieve higher-order physiological functions. Such a collective behavior can be assessed in the framework of co-expression networks, where genes are related by the similarity of their profile of expression across different conditions. In the context of the HMDP, it is investigated herein whether the predicted sets of genes show evidence of co-regulation in healthy and post-ISO hypertrophic strains. To that extent, the squared Pearson correlations (r2) is computed between the 36 best genes of both the FC and SAM sets. Correlation matrices are then cut off at r2>0.1 to keep significant interactions. Show in FIGS. 3A and 3B are the resulting co-expression networks in pre- and post-ISO conditions. It is clear that the two sets of genes form dense modules, and are disconnected from each other, with only few links between the two sets. Interestingly, it is shown that the biomarker and modulator of hypertrophy Nppb acts as a bridge between the two modules in pre-ISO condition (see FIG. 3A, top), and is even found strongly co-expressed with the SAM genes in post-ISO mice (see FIG. 3B). This suggests a role for Nppb in driving a cross-talk between FC genes and SAM genes. Finally, to quantify the relative density of the modules, they were compared to 1,000 sets of a similar number of randomly selected genes. The resulting Z scores are shown in FIG. 3C. Both SAM and FC sets show much stronger co-expression than randomly expected, with the SAM module being even denser under ISO condition. On the contrary, the density of links between the two modules is significantly smaller than expected by chance, indicating that the two sets of genes are disjoint sets in the co-expression network. Overall, these results show that the FC and SAM genes form two tight, disjoint communities in the co-expression network, both in pre-ISO and post-ISO mice.",
                                "The finding that the FC genes are strongly co-expressed suggests that they are co-regulated. To explore this possibility, enrichment in common TF binding sites was evaluated in the vicinity of the 36 FC genes. To compute the enrichment, iRegulon was used, a recent algorithm integrating different TF motifs databases and using phylogenic conservation to identify overrepresented binding sites in the \u221220/+20 kb regions around the Transcription Start Sites of genes of interest (see Methods, below). The identified motifs were then ranked by target enrichment among selected genes, and are associated with a list of putative TFs that can bind them (see FIG. 3C). It was found that the best-ranked motif is associated with repressor TFs Scrt1 and Scrt2, known to modulate the action of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Interestingly, the corresponding PWM motif is also matched to Snai3 TF, a gene ranked third among SAM genes. The second motif, VDR, is known to be involved in heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, the sixth predicted TF is associated with Hes1, which ranks tenth among the FC genes. This indicates that there is a cross-talk between the two modules at the gene regulatory level, with both FC and SAM genes being involved in the regulation of the expression of the FC genes.",
                                "5. Exploration of the Neighborhood in the Interactome",
                                "While useful to detect gene regulatory changes involved in the disease process, gene expression does not capture post-translational changes and interactions that occur at the protein level. To explore the potential involvement of the predicted sets of genes at the protein level, a previously published human interactome was used combining high-throughput and literature curated protein-protein, metabolic, kinase-substrate, signaling, and to a lesser extent regulatory interactions. After converting to human gene symbols (see Methods, below), the proteins encoded by the 36 best FC and SAM genes have respectively 364 and 346 interacting partners. Then, pathway enrichment was computed for these neighbors (see Methods). The other most highly enriched pathway is linked to NFAT signaling, known to be important in HF. Interestingly, it was found that the second most enriched pathway for FC neighbors is a previously published Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling Network (CHSN) containing 106 nodes (corresponding to 218 genes) giving a predictive model of hypertrophy in response to multiple stressors including ISO. Indeed, about 14% of FC neighbors are components of this network, compared to a predicted random association of 4% (Z=4, see FIG. 3D). The CHSN is shown in FIG. 3E, along with FC nodes directly interacting with CHSN nodes. In particular, it was found that Hes1 is interacting with several nodes of the CHSN at different levels of the hierarchy, namely FAK, JAK, STAT, CamK, PKC and HDAC.",
                                "6. Experimental Validation of Hes1",
                                "The previous results point toward a role for Hes1 in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Indeed, Hes1 was found to be a FC gene, an upstream regulator of FC genes, and an interactor with several components of the CHSN. To determine the function of Hes1 in the context of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, siRNA knockdown in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) was performed, followed by treatment with beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) or alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE) containing media. Both agents induce hypertrophy through different molecular pathways, as can be seen in the CHSN (see FIG. 3E). Using siRNA to silence Hes1 expression, a 20% to 40% decrease in Hes1 expression was achieved when compared to transfection control (see FIG. 4A). At the molecular level, treatment with either ISO or PE containing media drastically increases the expression of the HF markers Nppa and Nppb, which rose 3.5- and 7.9-fold, respectively under ISO treatment and 11-fold and 13-fold, under PE treatment in cells transfected with the control siRNA. Strikingly, knockdown of Hes1 expression strongly impaired the induction of these two markers under both treatment conditions. Nppa induction was reduced up to 110% and 88% under ISO and PE treatment while Nppb induction was reduced up to 66% and 91% under ISO and PE treatment, respectively. In addition to these molecular changes, the role of Hes1 in modulating the increase in cardiomyocyte cell cross-sectional area upon treatment with ISO and/or PE was investigated. As expected, following ISO/PE treatment, cells transfected with the control siRNA doubled in cellular cross-sectional area (see FIG. 4C). In comparison, cells transfected with the Hes1 siRNA showed up to 87% and 79% reduction in cell cross-sectional area increase following treatment with ISO and PE, respectively. This effect is consistent with the fact that HMDP strains showing no or mild hypertrophy exhibit strong negative fold-change of Hes1. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a role for Hes1 as a novel regulator of cardiac hypertrophy in vitro.",
                                "7. Discussion",
                                "The present study investigated the spectrum of cardiac hypertrophy and HF development in 100+ genetically diverse mice from the HMDP when subjected to chronic ISO infusion. Two types of responses were analyzed. First, the global response at the population level with a large number (1,000+) of genes involved, as detected by the SAM algorithm. Their global fold-change is representative of the global hypertrophy observed across all strains. However, the magnitude of their fold-change at the individual level does not predict the degree of individual hypertrophy. Using a correlation-based method, another group of about 40 genes was found that predicts the degree of hypertrophy. These can be called the \u201cFC\u201d genes in reference of the fact that they were found using their individual, strain-specific fold-change. Surprisingly, these genes have a near zero fold-change at the population level due to the cancelling contributions of up- and down-regulation in different strains, so that they are not detected using classical differential expression tools. While several FC genes have previously been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and HF (see Table 1, above), their high variability in such a controlled setup has not been explored previously. It is showed herein that these genes are enriched for heart failure gene candidates previously described in the literature, as well as for human cardiac disease genes. On the other hand, the best SAM genes are enriched in fibrosis disease genes. ISO has been shown to induce first myocardial fibrosis concomitantly with myocyte necrosis, followed by myocyte hypertrophy on a longer time scale, and fibrosis is also known to be an early manifestation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The results suggest that population-level SAM genes are predominantly associated with the early fibroblast response. On the other hand, since the change of heart mass is primarily determined by myocyte growth, the results suggest that FC genes are associated with the strain-specific degree of myocyte growth induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation.",
                                "The roles of these genes in different biological networks was further investigated. It was found that both FC and SAM genes form distinct co-expressed modules. Interestingly, Nppb (encoding the BNP protein), a widely used biomarker and modulator of HF, belongs to the FC set but is co-expressed with SAM genes in healthy mice, providing a unique bridge between the two sets. This result is consistent with the previous finding that Nppb is an antifibrotic hormone produced by myocytes with an important role as a local regulator of ventricular remodeling in mice. Indeed, Nppb is correlated to the fibrotic SAM genes in healthy mice, consistent with a regulatory homeostatic behavior, but is found among FC genes after beta-adrenergic stimulation, consistent with a response proportionate to myocytes hypertrophy. It is also interesting to note that the SAM module overlaps significantly (p=3.4e-6, hypergeometric test) with a co-expression module previously found in post-ISO mice and shown to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Indeed, it shares the genes Timp1, Tnc, Mfap5, Coll4a1 and Adamts2, the latter of which was validated experimentally as a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy.",
                                "Several TFs were then predicted to study this co-regulation. Interestingly, among the top TFs predicted as regulators of the FC genes, one of them, Hes1, belongs to the FC genes, and another one, Snai3, belongs to the SAM genes. Both inhibitory (Snai3, Hes1) and activatory (Vdr, Srebf1) TFs were found to have enriched binding sites around FC genes TSSs. This suggests a potential regulatory balance that could explain the up- and down-regulation observed for these genes across strains. Potential post-translational effects at the protein level were evaluated by using an integrated interactome. It was found that FC genes were strongly interacting with a cardiac hypertrophy signaling network (CHSN) previously shown to be predictive of cardiac hypertrophy in response to ISO and other stressors. This may indicate that several of those genes are upstream of a causal chain of events at the post-translational level that control myocyte growth. The FC gene Nppb is present both as an input and an output of the CHSN. This exemplifies an interesting feedback architecture where downstream effects can causally affect upstream regulation. Overall, the FC genes constitute a HF \u201cdisease module\u201d formed of co-regulated genes connected to the CHSN at the protein level.",
                                "A key finding of the study presented herein is that there is strong strain-to-strain variation in response to a stressor under similar well-controlled environmental conditions. This variation is largely explained by the different genetic backgrounds, as shown by the consistent responses in mice from same strains and the strong enrichment in heart diseases GWAS (see FIG. 2E). For example, Kcnip2 is known to be downregulated concomitantly with a reduction of Ito magnitude in cardiac hypertrophy. The results are consistent with this finding for the previously studied 129X1/SvJ strain, but show that Kcnip2 is upregulated in many strains with pronounced hypertrophy leading to an overall positive correlation between Kcnip2 expression and heart mass FC. This indicates that there are multiple possible compensatory mechanisms underlying a similar patho-phenotype. Similarly, a strong variation in the fold-change of Nppb was observed. It was previously shown to be over-expressed during cardiac hypertrophy as an anti-fibrotic factor. Using the multiple strains setup presented herein, a positive correlation between Nppb change of expression and the degree of hypertrophy was observed. However, some cases were observed where hypertrophic strains exhibit down-regulation of Nppb, including the widely used C57BL/6J and 129X1/SvJ strains (see FIG. 2D).",
                                "Finally, the approach was validated by testing Hes1's role in cardiac hypertrophy. Hes1 was chosen because of its involvement at different levels: found as a FC gene, Hes1 is also a predicted TF regulating the FC genes and a key interactor of the CHSN. Hes1 is part of the Notch signaling pathway which is highly conserved and involved in cell-cell communication between adjacent cells. This pathway is well known to play a crucial role in cardiac development and disease. Notch activity is required in complex organs like the heart that necessitate the coordinated development of multiple parts. Specifically, functional studies have shown that Notch activity is required for cardiovascular development and that Notch signaling causes downstream effects such as cell fate specification, cell proliferation, progenitor cell maintenance, apoptosis, and boundary formation. In previous studies, Hes1 expression was observed to increase following myocardial infarction and other ischemic cardiomyopathies. Increased expression of Hes1 was also shown to inhibit apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and promote instead their viability. However, whether Hes1 acts as a regulator of novel heart failure markers has remained unclear. Here, it is shown show that Hes1 knock-down induces a dramatic reduction of hypertrophy by 80-90% (see FIG. 4C), identifying for the first time Hes1 as a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, this result is consistent with the HMDP, where strains with no or mild hypertrophy have 20-50% decrease in Hes1 after ISO injection.",
                                "Overall, the individual, strain-specific responses to stressor-induced HF were explored and 36 FC genes were identified that are missed by traditional population-wide method of DEG analysis. It is shown that these FC genes provide a completely distinct, albeit complementary, picture of HF than population-wide DEGs. In particular, FC genes are enriched in human cardiac disease genes and hypertrophic pathways. This is important since previous studies that use population-level methods to identify DEGs have concluded that murine models are of limited relevance to human HF. In contrast, the findings show that FC genes, identified by a personalized differential expression analysis in a genetically diverse population of mice, are relevant to human HF. By linking those genes both to upstream regulators and to a signaling network predictive of cardiac hypertrophy, new insights are provided into the regulation of the severity of and resistance to cardiac hypertrophy at the individual level, and validate Hes1 as a novel regulator of cardiac hypertrophy in vitro. This approach is likely critically important for the appropriate design of upcoming experiments directed at unraveling causal genes in complex diseases.",

Strain were selected to increase resolution of genetic mapping with a renewable resource that is available to all investigators worldwide as well as to create a shared data repository that would allow the integration of data across multiple scales, including genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and clinical phenotypes. The core of the panel for association mapping consists of 29 classic parental inbred strains which are a subset of a group of mice commonly called the mouse diversity panel. HMDP strains were chosen by eliminating closely related strains and removing wild-derived strains. The decision to remove wild-derived stains reflects a tradeoff between statistical power and genetic diversity. While leaving out wild-derived strains sacrifices genetic diversity to some degree, the HMDP increased the statistical power (assuming the same number of animals) to identify genetic variants polymorphic among the classical inbred strains which affect traits. These variants yield a tremendous amount of phenotypic diversity among the classical inbred strains.",

More specifically, on average three untreated mice were used serving as control hearts and about three ISO treated mice of the same strain were used to measure the cardiac hypertrophic response. This response was studied in a total of 104 genetically different strains with the precise number of control and treated hearts for each strain. The number of untreated control hearts per strain was 2.75. The average number of ISO treated hearts per strain was 3.5. At sacrifice, hearts were excised, drained of excess blood and weighed. Each of the four chambers of the heart (left ventricle with inter-ventricular septum, right-ventricular free wall, right and left atria) was isolated and subsequently weighed. Cardiac hypertrophy for a given strain was calculated as the increase in average total heart weight after ISO treatment compared to control mice.",

For example, in the case of HF, the control population consists of N donors with healthy hearts intended to be used for transplantation, which are biopsied for gene expression analysis when left unused, and the diseased population consists of M late stage heart failure patients whose hearts are explanted and then biopsied for gene expression analysis. Importantly, the subjects in the control and diseased population are all genetically different. Hence, if the subjects were labeled by si, where the index i refers to subject i with its own genetic background distinct from all other subjects, the N subjects in the control population are (S1, S2, . . . , SN) (control subjects) and the M subjects in the diseased population are (SN+1, SN+2 . . . SN+M) (diseased subjects).",
                                "The data sets used for the differential gene expression analysis consists then of the expression level (log 2 mRNA number) of a large number of K genes for each subject. K is typically in the range of several thousands, and thus much larger than the number of control or diseased subjects (N or M, respectively) that are at most a few hundreds in the most extensive studies to date, and only a few subjects in each population in earlier studies. Let us label the expression levels by Ei(1) where the subscript i refers to subject i and the index j=1, K refers to gene j. To find out if a given gene j among the K genes is differentially expressed, it suffices to use a standard statistical test analogous to a student T-test to decide if the gene expression data for the control group (E1(j), E2(j), . . . , EN(j)) (expression data for gene j in control population) and for the diseased group (EN+1(j), EN+2), . . . , EN+M( )) (expression data for gene j in genetically distinct diseased population) originate from the same or different distributions. This test is carried out for all K genes and differentially expressed genes are then ranked in order of statistical significance (e.g., with increasing p-value less than some threshold of statistical significance). This approach is well-established and can be performed using existing bioinformatics tools such as SAM (Statistical Analysis of Microarrays).",

The control population consists of one mouse per strain (for N strains) before treatment with a beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (ISO) inducing cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Since all strains are genetically distinct the subjects in the control population are genetically distinct and can be labelled as (S1, S2, . . . , SN) (genetically identical control and diseased populations in the HMDP). Hearts from those subjects before ISO treatment are biopsied and used for microarray analysis. Biopsy requires sacrificing the animals that cannot be ISO treated. However, another mouse from the same strain can be ISO treated and similarly for all N strains. Therefore, the diseased/treated population is genetically identical to the control population and has the same degree of genetic diversity, leaving aside for now epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene expression and trait that are discussed further below.",

This ratio is calculated by measuring total heart mass for several mice from the same strain before and after ISO treatment and averaging measured values before and after ISO treatment prior to taking their ratio. Importantly, values of m\u2032i/mi range continuously from about 1 (no change of heart mass) to 2 (two-fold change of heart mass) among strains. Differential gene expression can then be examined by asking whether a given gene j contributes to the severity of cardiac hypertrophy.

This feature was used to measure gene expression in replicates (e.g., two hearts in control or two hearts after ISO treatment) to test for replicability in about ten percent of the strains. The results of this replicability analysis show that genetics play a dominant role in controlling gene expression and that using two mice per strain (on in the control group and one in the treated group) is sufficient to identify FC genes. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that, remarkably, the FC genes turn out to be for the most part completely different than the traditional SAM genes, and causally related to hypertrophy as assessed by further analysis of pathway enrichment and direct experimental validation of the role of one FC gene.",

Therefore, the size of the Largest Connected Component (LCC) of the network was evaluated when hard-thresholding with several correlation cutoffs. A fast decrease was observed of the LCC size at low thresholds of 0.35-0.45, followed by milder steady decrease. A cutoff was used of 0.5 corresponding to that stabilization plateau and kept the 11,279 genes in the LCC. The effect of this filter is made clear by looking at a selection of functional genes linked to the electromechanical coupling in heart cells. The rejected genes (gray bars) have either low expression (e.g., Calm4, Kcnd3) or display systematic saturation effects inherent to the microarray assay, which results in noisy correlations (e.g., Tnnc1, Atp2a2). These 11,279 genes can be used as input to the different methods.",
