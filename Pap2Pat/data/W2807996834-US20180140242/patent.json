                        "Schizophrenia is a complex, challenging, and heterogeneous psychiatric condition affecting an estimated 0.45%-1% of the world population (van Os & Kapur, 2009, Lancet 374:635-645). Patients suffering with schizophrenia present with a range of symptoms including positive symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders, and agitation; negative symptoms, such as mood flatness and lack of pleasure in daily life; cognitive symptoms, such as the decreased ability to understand information and make decisions, difficulty focusing, and decreased working memory function; and sleep disorders.",
                        "Schizophrenia is a chronic disease that requires long-term treatment to achieve sustained symptom control, reduce the risk of relapse, improve patient functioning and overall quality of life (Andreasen, 1995, Lancet. 346(8973):477-81; Ascher-Svanum et al., 2006, J Clin Psychiatry 67(3):453-60; Keith et al. 2003, J Clin Psychiatry 64(11):1308-15). It is estimated that up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to a daily oral treatment regimen of antipsychotics (Bhanji et al., 2004, 14(2):87-92). Poor adherence, particularly among persons early in the course of their illness, leads to worse long-term outcomes (including enhanced risk of relapse) than does consistent, well-documented treatment (Subotnik et al., 2011, Am J Psych 168(3): 286-292). Estimated one-year rates of nonadherence to medication regimen, such as treatment discontinuation or interruption, ranges from 40% to 75% (Bhanji et al., 2004, 14(2):87-92; Masand et al., 2009, 11(4):147-54; Weiden & Zygmunt, 1997, J Pract Psychiatr Behav Health 3:106-110). Although long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of atypical antipsychotics have been developed in order to improve patient adherence, numerous challenges remain for adoption of these treatments into general psychiatric practice (Kane et al., 2014, J Clin Psychiatry 75(12): e33; Weiden et al., 2015, J Clin Psychiatry 76(6): 684-690). For example, it takes months for LAIs to achieve steady-state equilibrium, and knowing how to quickly transition patients from prior treatments to optimal doses of a new LAI regimen can be difficult.",
                        "Most schizophrenia patients experience multiple relapses during their disease course. Repeated relapses may lead to treatment resistance, cognitive impairment, decreased quality of life, and increased economic burden. Existing clinical practice is inefficient to detect relapse early. The symptoms of relapse usually develop in less than 4 weeks. Existing clinical practice typically have the patients come in for a check every month, which is inefficient to detect relapse early. Accordingly, there is an unmet need to detect patients that are at risk of relapse."

In one embodiment, the patient monitored by the methods of the present invention has had only one episode of psychosis. In other embodiments, the patient monitored by the methods of the present invention has had more than one episode of psychosis. The methods of the invention can be used to monitor patients that are currently institutionalized (i.e., in a psychiatric facility) as well as those who are not (i.e., in a halfway house, living with a caregiver or living independently).",

Symptom severity can be measured by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, symptom severity can be assessed using questions asked to the patient. The questions can be a self assessment by the patient, asked to the patient by a caregiver or asked to the patient by a healthcare provider.",

                        {
                            "title": "PANSS",
                            "paragraphs": [
                                "The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987, Schizophr. Bull. 13:261-276) is a widely used medical scale for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. The healthcare provider rates the patient as a 1 to 7 on 30 symptoms based on a clinical interview as well as reports of family members or primary care hospital workers. The 30 items are grouped into 3 subscales: positive scale (7 items), negative scale (7 items), and general psychopathology scale (16 items) (Table 1). The PANSS total score ranges from 30 to 210. The PANSS is typically administered when the patient is seen by a healthcare provider, at least every 4 weeks, preferably biweekly, more preferably every week. While these are the preferred intervals for evaluation, the patient may be administered the interview less frequently based on the patient's ability to attend appointments with the healthcare provider and/or the length of time it takes to administer the full PANSS assessment (about 1 hour).",
                                "The present invention has identified a subset of PANSS items that are predictive of a schizophrenic relapse and thus reduce the time of assessment by the healthcare provider as well as increase the predictive value of imminent relapse.",
                                "**Relapse**",
                                "Relapse, characterized by acute psychotic exacerbation, may have serious implications. For example, there is a risk of patients harming themselves or others, of jeopardizing personal relationships, education or employment status (Kane, 2007, J Clin Psychiatry 68 (Suppl 14): 27-30), and of further stigmatization of the illness. Additionally, relapse may carry a biological risk. It has been proposed that active psychosis reflects a period of disease progression insofar as patients may not return to their previous level of function and treatment refractoriness may emerge (Wyatt, 1997, Schizophr Bull. 23: 3-9; Lieberman et al, 1996, Neuropsychopharmacol. 14: 13S-21S).",
                                "Reliable early warning signs of relapse offer the opportunity of early intervention and prevention of florid relapse. However, whereas the onset of a first episode of psychosis may be gradual and is typically heralded by a prodromal period lasting months to even years (Yung & McGorry et al., 1996, Schizophr Bull. 22: 353-370), this does not appear to be the case in relapse episodes. For these reasons it has been recommended that the term \u201cprodromal symptoms\u201d be restricted to precursors of a first psychotic episode and \u201cearly warning signs\u201d be used to describe antecedents of psychotic relapse (Bustillo et al., 1995, Schizophr Bull. 21: 553-559). Prior to the present invention, studies suggested that it is difficult to identify many patients who are at risk of imminent relapse in clinical practice, and that early warning signs are relatively unreliable predictors of relapse (Norman & Malla, 1995, Schizophr Bull. 21: 527-539; Gaebel & Riesbeck, 2007, Schizophr Res. 95: 19-29, Gaebel et al, 1993, Br J Psychiatry Suppl. 21: 8-12).",
                                "Relapse can be defined by any one of the following criteria: 1) psychiatric hospitalization (involuntary or voluntary admission to a psychiatric hospital for decomposition of the patient's schizophrenia symptoms); 2) deliberate self-injury or aggressive behavior, or suicidal or homicidal ideation and aggressive behavior that was clinically significant; and 3) 25% increase in PANSS total score for two consecutive assessments for patients who scored >40 or a 10-point increase for patients who scored \u226440.",
                                "The methods of the present invention can be used to identify schizophrenic patients that are risk of relapse. One advantage of the present invention is that only a subset of PANSS items are used thus decreasing resource demands and the time it takes for patient evaluation. Additionally, the subset of PANSS items used allows the healthcare provider to focus on only those items relevant to prediction of relapse and thus decrease the noise of items less relevant to predication of relapse.",
                                "**Remote Detection of Symptom Severity**",
                                "In some embodiments of the present invention, the severity of the subset of symptoms (e.g. the PANSS item score) can be transmitted to a healthcare provider remotely thus increasing the number of assessments that can be taken due to the freedom from physically having to visit the healthcare provider. The patient or their caregiver can document the symptom severity (e.g., PANSS item score and/or other biometric data) without a healthcare provider present. Data can be conveniently entered onto the system while the user may continue to use the local computing device for other purposes. A local computing device may comprise, for example, a computing device worn on the body (e.g. a head-worn computing device such as a Google Glass, a wrist-worn computing device such as a Samsung Galaxy Gear Smart Watch, etc.), a tablet computer (e.g. an Apple iPad, an Apple iPod, a Google Nexus tablet, a Samsung Galaxy Tab, a Microsoft Surface, etc.), a smartphone (e.g. an Apple iPhone, a Google Nexus phone, a Samsung Galaxy phone, etc.).",
                                "In one embodiment, the data is collected and transmitted by an electronic device including, but not limited to, a wearable device that sends data to a healthcare provider. In another embodiment, an electronic questionnaire answered by the patient or their caregiver is used to transmit data to a healthcare provider. In another embodiment, a combination of an electronic device and an electronic questionnaire is used to transmit data to a healthcare provider.",
                                "In one embodiment, data concerning PANSS items P01, P02, P03, P04, P06, G02 and G04 are transmitted to the healthcare provider. A comparison can be made between the most recent transmitted data and data from one or more previous assessment. An increase in at least 4, at least 5, at least 6 or all 7 PANSS items alerts the healthcare provider that the patient is at risk for a schizophrenia relapse.",
                                "In another embodiment, data concerning PANSS items P01, P02, P03, P04, P06, P07, G02, G04 and G09 are transmitted to the healthcare provider. A comparison can be made between the most recent transmitted data and data from one or more previous assessments. An increase in at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8 or all 9 PANSS items alerts the healthcare provider that the patient is at risk for a schizophrenia relapse.",
                                "**Biomarkers**",
                                "A biomarker is a measurable indicator of a biological state or condition. The present invention identifies soluble biomarkers that show increased levels in body fluids of patients about to undergo or presently undergoing a schizophrenia relapse. Biomarker levels increase at least 1 month, at least 1 week, at least 3 days or at least 1 day prior to schizophrenia relapse.",
                                "According to the methods of the invention, biomarker level in a body fluid of a patient is measured and the amount of change in the biomarker level in the body fluid of the patient as compared to a previously measured biomarker level in the body fluid of the patient is determined. An increase in the biomarker level indicates the patient is at risk for a schizophrenic relapse. Patients have the biomarker level measured at least every month, at least every 2 weeks, at least every week.",
                                "In one embodiment, the biomarker is the interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) or a fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the IL6R is in soluble form. An increase of at least 4 ng/ml of IL6R in the body fluid of a patient as compared to a previously measured level in the patient indicates the patient is at risk for a schizophrenic relapse.",
                                "In another embodiment, the biomarker is interleukin 6 (IL6). An increase of at least 0.1 pg/ml of IL6 in the body fluid of a patient as compared to a previously measured level in the patient indicates the patient is at risk for a schizophrenic relapse.",
                                "In another embodiment, the biomarker is cortisol. An increase of at least 1 \u03bcg/ml of cortisol in the body fluid of a patient as compared to a previously measured level in the patient indicates the patient is at risk for a schizophrenic relapse.",
                                "One or more biomarkers can be used to identify a patient at risk of a schizophrenic relapse. In one embodiment, the level of one biomarker is detected in a patient. In another embodiment, two biomarker levels are detected in a patient. In yet another embodiment, three biomarker levels are detected in a patient.",
                                "Biomarkers can be detected in any body fluid including, but not limited to, blood, plasma, serum, lymph, saliva and urine. In preferred embodiments, the body fluid is blood.",
                                "Any method can be used to measure and quantify the biomarkers used in the methods of the invention. Methods to measure protein expression levels of biomarkers include, but are not limited to, western blot, immunoblot, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (MA), immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, chemiluminescence, fluorescent polarization, phosphorescence, immunohistochemical analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, microcytometry, microarray, microscopy, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), flow cytometry, and assays based on a property of the biomarker including but not limited to ligand binding, or interaction with other protein partners.",
                                "**Pharmaceutical Agents**",

These 7 PANSS items included P1 [delusions] (mean change (standard error): 1.53 (0.08)), P2 [conceptual disorganization] (1.12 (0.07)), P3 [hallucinations] (1.44 (0.09)), P4 [excitement] (1.29 (0.07)), and P6 [suspiciousness] (1.49 (0.08)) from the positive symptom subscale as well as G2 [anxiety] (1.32 (0.07)) and G4 [tension] (1.24 (0.07)) from the general psychopathology subscale. Similar patterns were observed among patients whose relapses were defined by psychiatric events (FIG. 1B) as well as for changes at relapse from the last pre-relapse visit (FIG. 1C) and for changes at relapse defined by psychiatric events from the last pre-relapse visit (FIG. 1D).",

The trajectories estimated from the non-linear mixed effect models were focused on because the parameters of these models can be easily interpreted. FIG. 3 shows the trajectories and their 95% confidence intervals of the 7 individual PANSS items that changed most at relapse as well as a negative control (an individual PANSS item with little increase (G7 [Motor retardation]) at relapse). The trajectories of the PANSS items that changed most at relapse suggested that these items started to increase about 7-10 days before relapse.",

The study was done to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 3-month formulation of paliperidone palmitate (PP3M) vs placebo in delaying time to relapse of schizophrenia symptoms in patients previously treated with once-monthly paliperidone palmitate (PP1M) for at least 4 months (Beernaert's et al., 2015, JAMA Psychiatry 72(8):830-839). Biomarker collection was added as an amendment after the study had been partially completed. Sixty three patients had biomarker data collected. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, consistent Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements.",

Stabilized patients were randomized (1:1) to fixed dose of PP3M (175, 263, 350, or 525 mg eq.) or placebo during the DB phase. Patient blood was sampled from week 17 and every 4 weeks thereafter until study end for biomarker evaluations. Patient blood was analyzed for the following biomarkers: leptin, adiponectin, mature BDNF, IGF1, cortisol, CRP, TNF\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, IL6, IL6 receptor (IL6R), IL10, gp130 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA).

Fourteen of the relapsed patients had biomarker measurement performed before relapse. Nine of the relapsed patients with biomarker measurements had measurements prior to and during the relapse point. Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) showed statistically significant changes from prior-to-relapse to relapse (p=0.05) (see FIGS. 4A-4C). Cortisol showed the largest difference between PP3M-treated stable patients and those prior to relapse (see FIGS. 6A-6C). Table 8 shows the change in biomarker levels in patients during relapse as compared to biomarker level prior to relapse. For all biomarkers, 1 or 2 patients showed large changes from prior-to-relapse to relapse, suggesting possibility of relapse processes that are accompanied by hormonal, metabolic or inflammatory changes."
