# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse

## BACKGROUND

- describe schizophrenia
- highlight limitations of current treatment and need for early detection

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce method of identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse
- describe use of symptom subset and/or biomarker levels
- outline administration of pharmaceutical agent to prevent relapse

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- describe patient population and monitoring
- detail symptom severity measurement using PANSS
- outline biomarker measurement and pharmaceutical agent administration

### PANSS

- introduce PANSS scale
- describe PANSS items and scoring
- highlight predictive value of subset of PANSS items
- describe administration of PANSS assessment
- outline benefits of using subset of PANSS items
- describe remote detection of symptom severity
- detail transmission of data to healthcare provider
- outline comparison of transmitted data to previous assessments
- describe alert system for healthcare provider
- highlight advantages of remote detection

## EXAMPLES

- introduce examples of the invention

### PANSS: Methods

- describe study design and data collection
- summarize study protocols and patient consent

### PANSS: Definition of Relapse

- define relapse criteria

### PANSS: Statistical Analysis

- describe statistical models for PANSS item trajectories
- explain linear and non-linear mixed effect models
- summarize model selection and parameter interpretation

### PANSS: Demographics and Characteristics of Patients Experienced a Relapse During Double-Blind Phase

- summarize patient demographics and characteristics

### Example 5

- identify PANSS items with most increases at relapse
- describe trajectories of PANSS items increase before relapse
- summarize results of linear and non-linear mixed effect models
- discuss implications of PANSS item trajectories
- highlight importance of close monitoring for early detection of relapse
