# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse

## BACKGROUND

- describe schizophrenia
- discuss symptoms of schizophrenia
- discuss challenges of treating schizophrenia
- highlight need for early detection of relapse
- discuss limitations of current clinical practice

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce method of identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse
- describe use of targeted set of interview-based observations
- describe use of biomarker levels
- specify particular symptoms used in method
- specify biomarkers used in method
- describe administration of pharmaceutical agent
- describe goal of decreasing likelihood of relapse

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- discuss advantages of subset of PANSS items
- describe remote detection of symptom severity
- discuss electronic devices for remote detection
- describe electronic questionnaire for remote detection
- discuss transmission of data to healthcare provider
- describe comparison of data to previous assessments
- discuss alerting healthcare provider of relapse risk
- describe use of PANSS items P01-P04, P06, G02, G04
- describe use of PANSS items P01-P04, P06, P07, G02, G04, G09
- discuss increase in PANSS items indicating relapse risk
- describe advantages of remote detection
- discuss increased frequency of assessments

## EXAMPLES

- introduce examples of the invention

### PANSS: Methods

- pool data from three studies
- describe study designs
- summarize differences in study designs
- report previous findings

### PANSS: Definition of Relapse

- define primary efficacy variable
- list criteria for relapse
- explain exclusions from analysis

### PANSS: Statistical Analysis

- sort PANSS items by changes at relapse
- apply linear mixed effect models
- apply non-linear mixed effect models
- describe parameters of exponential function
- explain model selection
- include subject-level random effect

### PANSS: Demographics and Characteristics of Patients Experienced a Relapse During Double-Blind Phase

- summarize demographics and characteristics

### Example 5

- identify PANSS items with most increases at relapse
- show trajectories of PANSS items increase before relapse
- estimate parameters of non-linear mixed effect models
- interpret parameters of exponential function
- show trajectories of individual PANSS items
- discuss results
- summarize changes at relapse
- summarize changes at relapse from last pre-relapse visit
- summarize changes at relapse defined by psychiatric events
- summarize changes at relapse defined by psychiatric events from last pre-relapse visit
- discuss implications for early detection of relapse
