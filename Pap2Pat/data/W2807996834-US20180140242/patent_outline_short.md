# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- relate to identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse

## BACKGROUND

- describe schizophrenia and its challenges

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- identify patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse using symptoms and biomarkers

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

- describe methods of identifying patients at risk of schizophrenic relapse using symptoms and biomarkers

### PANSS

- introduce PANSS scale
- describe PANSS items and scoring
- identify subset of PANSS items predictive of relapse
- describe use of PANSS in identifying patients at risk of relapse
- discuss advantages of using subset of PANSS items

## EXAMPLES

- present non-limiting examples of the invention

### PANSS: Methods

- describe study design and methods for PANSS analysis

### PANSS: Definition of Relapse

- define relapse criteria for PANSS analysis

### PANSS: Statistical Analysis

- describe statistical models for PANSS item trajectories

### PANSS: Demographics and Characteristics of Patients Experienced a Relapse During Double-Blind Phase

- summarize demographics and characteristics of relapsed patients

### Example 5

- identify PANSS items with most increases at relapse
- model trajectories of PANSS items increase before relapse
