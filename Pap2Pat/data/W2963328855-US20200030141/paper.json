    "abstract": "Conjunctivochalasis is a common cause of tear dysfunction due to the conjunctiva becoming loose and wrinkly with age. The current solutions to this disease include either surgical excision in the operating room, or thermoreduction of the loose tissue with hot wire in the clinic. We developed a near-infrared laser thermal conjunctivoplasty system. The system utilizes a 1460-nm programmable laser diode system as the light source. At this wavelength, a water absorption peak exists and the blood absorption is minimal, so the heating of redundant conjunctiva is even and there is no bleeding. A miniaturized handheld probe delivers the laser light and reshapes the laser into a 10 \u00d7 1 mm 2 line on the working plane. A foot pedal is used to deliver a preset number of calibrated laser pulses. A fold of loose conjunctiva is grasped by a pair of forceps. The NIR laser light is delivered through an optical fiber and a laser line is aimed exactly on the conjunctival fold by a cylindrical lens. Ex vivo experiments using porcine eye was performed to investigate the induced shrinkage of conjunctiva and decide the optimal laser parameters. It was found that up to 45% of conjunctiva shrinkage could be achieved.",

                "The sclera, white part of the eye, is covered by a thin, clear membrane called the conjunctiva. Like skin, the conjunctiva becomes loose and wrinkly with age; this degenerative condition is called conjunctivochalasis1. The loose folds of conjunctiva often disrupt the uniform distribution of tears and can cause constant eye irritation and blurred vision2,3. In severe cases, the conjunctival folds protrude onto the inferior eye lid margin and are traumatized by the lid during blinking. Furthermore, the lid\u2019s skin is also irritated and altered by the displaced tear.",
                "Conjunctivochalasis is a common cause of tear dysfunction (\u201cdry eyes\u201d); however, it does not respond to the usual dry eye treatments such as artificial tears, punctal plugs and anti-inflammatory drops. Effective treatment requires surgical reduction or excision of the redundant conjunctiva to reestablish the inferior tear meniscus and normal tear dynamics. Conjunctivochalasis is typically diagnosed by evaluating the conjunctiva for redundant folds that prolapse onto the lower eyelid and obliterate the tear meniscus in that region. Cross-sectional optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows us for evaluating the severity of the condition and the effectiveness of surgery to remove the redundant tissue4\u20136.",
                "Surgical means used to remove redundant conjunctival tissue is an effective way to treat conjunctivochalasis. Several techniques currently are employed in the surgery, such as thermocautery, electrocautery, and paste-pinch-cut7\u201310. Thermocautery and electrocautery reach temperatures exceeding the boiling point of water and can burn the conjunctival epithelium, underlying stroma, and surrounding tissue. This creates a full thickness burn wound that is generally painful, takes up to one month to fully heal, and occasionally induces excessive inflammation with scarring. Furthermore, a chronic inflammatory conjunctival mass called pyogenic granuloma could result, which would necessitate long-term anti-inflammatory eye drops and possibly further surgery. Poor cosmetic appearance (i.e. red blots due to bleeding in surface tissue) or scarring during the long healing period also deters patients from these techniques. Some surgeons have reservations about using thermo- or electrocautery because of the risk of causing excessive damage to the conjunctiva or cornea if the patient\u2019s eye moves during the procedure. Surgical conjunctival excision with the addition of an amniotic membrane transplant (attached by fibrin glue or suture) can improve the healing course, but must be performed in the operating room, which markedly increases cost. The paste-pinch-cut technique uses forceps to hold the conjunctival and cuts the redundant part directly. The wound will be polymerized with pre-pasted fibrin sealant. Compared with thermocautery and electrocautery, this approach could bring less pain to the patient but must be performed in an operating room and still needs several weeks to resolve the inflamed tissus surface11. Laser conjunctivoplasty, on the other hand, can well constrain the thermal energy in the target area and depth and precisely control the amount of energy thus avoiding burning the conjunctival epithelium and underlying stroma.",
                "Argon lasers have been used for laser conjunctivoplasty12,13. However, they work at a wavelength of 532\u2009nm and the laser energy is primarily absorbed by blood and can lead to vessel rupture and hemorrhage. Because the water content of conjunctiva is around 70%14, heating the conjunctiva using water absorption is a more effective and safe way to achieve shrinkage. In this paper, we proposed to use the near-infrared (NIR) light for LTC, because the blood absorption at this waveband is much weaker than that at visible region15,16 while two strong water absorption peaks exist at 1460\u2009nm and 1940 nm17. Compared with the expensive and inefficient lasers at 1940 nm, the diode laser at 1460\u2009nm has an electro-optical efficiency of >40% and the price of the commercial products is reasonable. Thus we developed a miniature-probed-based LTC system using a laser diode system at this wavelength. Ex vivo experiments on porcine eye were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the NIR LTC."

                        "During the laser heating procedure, the temperature continues to increase until the laser is turned off. However, to optimize the shrinking, the temperature should be kept in a range to avoid burning and boiling. The collagen shrinkage temperate is around 62 \u00b0C18 and to avoid boiling, the temperature should be kept below 100 \u00b0C. So idea temperature is between 62 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C. In order to achieve this, we use pulse laser for the heating and a pulse repetition rate of 1\u2009Hz and a working duration of 4\u2009seconds (a total of 4 pulses) were selected.",
                        "Figure\u00a01 shows the temperature changes during the LTC. The highest temperatures in each of recorded thermal camera image sequences were obtained. It can be seen that the peak temperature increases very fast during the laser pulse illumination period and decreases relatively slowly during the laser-off period. The effects of peak laser power and pulse duty cycle were investigated. With the laser peak power of 1.51\u2009W and duty cycle of 10% (100\u2009ms pulse duration), the temperature increase is very small and the temperature is always below 40 \u00b0C [Fig.\u00a01(a)]. When the duty cycle was increased to 20% (200\u2009ms pulse duration) and 30% (300\u2009ms pulse duration), the cumulative effect of multiple pulses can be clearly seen. The temperature will increase during the laser-illumination period and the temperature will drop during the laser-off period. This temperature increase-decrease process will continue with the increase of the pulse numbers. For a peak power of 3\u2009W, the maximum temperature for the 30% duty cycle exceeds 100 \u00b0C while the maximum temperature for the 10% duty cycle is around 65 \u00b0C [Fig.\u00a01(b)]. When the peak power was further increased to 5.77\u2009W, the maximum temperature exceeds 100 \u00b0C for all three different duty cycles [Fig.\u00a01(c)].Figure 1Temperature changes during the LTC process using different laser parameters."

As demonstrated, the shrinkage increases as the laser peak power increases. For the peak power of 2.33\u2009W, the shrinkage is 21%. As the peak power increases to 3\u2009W and 3.66\u2009W, the shrinkage increased to 36% and 45%, respectively.Figure 3Photographs of the regions in the porcine eyes before and after LTC with different laser powers.

So we used the 3-W peak power to investigate the influence of the pulse duty cycle on the shrinkage. Figure\u00a04 shows the microscope images of the shrinkage at the pulse duty cycles of 10%, 20% and 30%. It can be seen from the images, at 10% of the duty cycle, the shrinkage is minimal (\u223c8%). When the duty cycle increases to 30%, the shrinkage is 45%. However, the tissue surface was damaged due to a high temperature of more than 100 \u00b0C [Fig.\u00a01(b)].Figure 4Photographs of the porcine eyes before and after LTC with different pulse duty cycle and a peak power of 3\u2009W.

                        "To determine the optimal laser parameters for the LTC, it is necessary to analyze the relationship between the shrinkage and the tissue temperature at different laser parameters. For a specific laser parameter combination, the shrinkage and temperature was measured 6\u20138 times on different samples and the averaged values were obtained. Figure\u00a05(a) shows the shrinkage and temperature as a function of laser peak power. The default duty cycle of 20% was used. It can be seen the temperature keeps increasing as the peak power increases while the shrinkage starts to saturate when the peak power is higher than 3\u2009W. A peak power of 3\u2009W is ideal for the LTC application. The shrinkage and temperature as a function of pulse duty cycle is shown in Fig.\u00a05(b). The peak power was set at 3\u2009W. When the duty cycle is 30%, the temperature is above 110 \u00b0C while the shrinkage is comparable with that of the 20% duty cycle.Figure 5(a) Shrinkage and temperature as a function of laser peak power. The pulse laser duty cycle is set at 20%. The shrinkage rate saturates with the increase of the peak power and the temperature continues to increase with the increase of the peak power.

The texture and contents of the conjunctiva of the porcine eye is very close to those of the human eye, so we can expect to achieve similar shrinkage from conjunctivoplasty surgery of human subjects by using this NIR LTC system. However, before testing it on human subjects, further in vivo animal experiments are still needed based on the following considerations. (1) The initial temperature of the porcine eye was about 20 \u00b0C, which is lower than that of the human patients. Therefore, the optimal laser parameters decided here may not be appropriate for the actual treatment of redundant conjunctiva. The laser parameters need to be calibrated by using in vivo animals with a similar body temperature as human being. (2) The ex vivo eye does not have blood circulations, therefore a living eye is needed to assesses conjunctival hyperemia (a measure of inflammation), hemorrhage (bleeding inside tissue), and blanching (a measure of ischemia). (3) The ex vivo eye does not have a healing response, therefore in vivo animal experiment are needed to assess epithelial healing, fibroblast repopulation of the stroma, any scarring formation, and whether the shrinkage is maintained in the long term.",
                "In summary, we have developed a NIR LTC using a 1460-nm wavelength laser, which can be efficiently absorbed by water. We developed a compact handheld probe with optimized features for LTC, including a line-shape focus spot and angled forceps. The laser parameters were optimized and ex vivo experiments of on porcine eye was performed. Up to 45% of conjunctiva shrinkage was observed."

The pulse duty cycle, repetition rate, output power and working duration are tunable through a LabVIEW (LabVIEW 2015, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) based control software. The duty cycle, repetition rate, and working duration is arbitrarily tunable. Limited by the capacities of the commercial laser diode module, the maximum output power and the shortest pulse width are 12\u2009W and 100 \u03bcs, respectively. A 650-nm aiming light could be enabled and disabled by the operator from the control software. A foot pedal is used as a trigger for the laser output. Once the laser output is triggered, the 650-nm aiming light will be turned off automatically and the 1460-nm laser will be delivered to the probe according to the preset parameters. However, if the foot pedal is released during the procedure, the infrared laser will be turned off immediately. The photograph of the prototype of the LTC laser system is shown in Fig.\u00a01(b).

The thickness of the human conjunctiva is approximately 0.24\u2009mm, and loose conjunctiva folded over when grasped by the surgical forceps should be approximately 0.5\u2009mm thick. For this thickness, the thermal relaxation time is 0.5\u2009s. So the pulse duration needs to be shorter than 0.5\u2009s for the thermal energy to be confined to within this depth.",

This strategy can not only reduce the requirement of peak power for effective shrinkage of the conjunctiva, but also keep the optimal temperature for a suitable period of time. The pulse train is emitted at a fixed repetition rate. This repetition rate can be estimated as following. For a pulse period including the pulse-tissue interaction and laser-off thermal relaxation, a thermal relaxation of 0.5\u2009s indicating the pulse duration should be shorter than 0.5\u2009s for confine the thermal energy in depth, while the laser-off duration should be around or a little bit longer than 0.5\u2009s for effective heat dissipation of this pulse. So the pulse period should be 1\u2009s, corresponding to a repetition rate of 1\u2009Hz. The effectiveness of this estimation has been validated by the temperature variation in Section 3.1. We set a time duration of 4\u2009seconds for the LTC process, which corresponds to 4 pulses at a repetition rate of 1\u2009Hz."

Frozen porcine eye balls were thawed in phosphate buffered saline before the experiment. To keep the condition of the tissue consistent, we used each position on the conjunctiva once. Because each porcine eye has a finite area of the conjunctiva and we were using a beam size of 10 \u00d7 1\u2009mm2, the laser radiation on a single eye was limited to 6\u20138 times. Around 30 porcine eyes were used in this study.

The line-focused light from the LTC probe was targeted to shine between the parallel marker lines on the conjunctiva. The angled forceps which grasp the tissue may introduce false shrinkage due to force applied on the conjunctiva. So, the angle forceps will not be used in the experiments for optimizing the laser parameters. A thermal camera (TiS45, Fluke, Everett, WA, USA) was used to record the temporal temperature change in the region during the LTC. OCT was also used to monitor the tissue structural change during the LTC. Figure\u00a011(a) shows the experimental setup for LTC (bottom) and thermal camera image (top) of the porcine eye during the LTC. The thermal camera allows the record of the images during the LTC. A custom 1310-nm swept-source OCT system with an A-line rate of 50\u2009kHz, a transverse resolution of 15 \u03bcm, and an axial resolution of 8.5 \u03bcm was used to monitor the LTC process. The detailed information about the OCT system has been described in a previous publication23. Figure\u00a011(b) shows the schematic of the OCT experiment. The OCT B-scan covered a range of 5\u2009mm and repeated B-scan at this same location was recorded. The OCT imaging rate is 50 frames per second. The laser-induced shrinkage was measured [Fig.\u00a011(c)]. The photographs of the targeted area before and after the LTC were taken with a digital microscope (OMAX, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). The shrinkage percentage of the region was obtained by comparing the two images."
