    "date": "2018-07-27",
    "abstract": "PDGF-CC is a member of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family that stimulates PDGFR\u03b1 phosphorylation and thereby activates intracellular signalling events essential for development but also in cancer, fibrosis and neuropathologies involving blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. In order to elucidate the biological and pathological role(s) of PDGF-CC signalling, we have generated high affinity neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing human PDGF-CC. We determined the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the selected clones, and mapped the binding epitope for clone 6B3. Using the monoclonal 6B3, we determined the expression pattern for PDGF-CC in different human primary tumours and control tissues, and explored its ability to neutralize PDGF-CC-induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1. In addition, we showed that PDGF-CC induced disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) was significantly reduced upon intraperitoneal administration of a chimeric anti-PDGF-CC antibody. In summary, we report on high affinity monoclonal antibodies against PDGF-CC that have therapeutic efficacy in vivo.",

                "Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) have important functions during development but also in diverse pathological conditions [1]. PDGF-CC is a member of the PDGF family that has been extensively characterized during the past decade [2\u20136]. Upon PDGF-CC binding, PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) subunits become dimerized, leading to receptor autophosphorylation. This initiates intracellular signalling events triggering responses such as cell proliferation, migration, contraction and survival [7]. In contrast to other PDGF family members, activation of full-length PDGF-CC requires proteolytic cleavage whereby the dimeric conserved growth factor domain (GFD) is released from the N-terminal CUB domain. Activation of latent PDGF-CC by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been characterized in detail and seems largely confined to the CNS [8, 9], while in other tissues, other proteases can activate PDGF-CC [2, 10].",
                "Autocrine and paracrine PDGF signalling is involved in pathogenesis of gliomas, sarcomas, leukemias and epithelial cancers [11, 12]. In addition, PDGFs drive pathological mesenchymal responses in vascular disorders and fibrotic diseases [1]. Further, dysregulation in the PDGF/PDGFR system such as constitutive activation of PDGFRs, or mutations which up/downregulate both ligand and receptor activities, contribute to osteosarcomas, lung carcinomas, gliomas, astrocytomas and medulloblastomas [12, 13]. Apart from PDGF-CC being a potent proto-oncogene that induces malignant transformation of fibroblasts, it also serves as a mitogen for many cell types of mesenchymal origin, including certain stem cells, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells [7, 9, 14, 15].",
                "The importance of PDGF-CC in tumour biology has recently been emphasized by demonstration of the capacity of PDGF-CC to facilitate tumour growth via recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) into the tumour mass, and also by increasing tumour angiogenesis through induction of the angiogenic factor osteopontin [16]. It has also been reported that overexpression of PDGF-CC resulted in liver steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in a Pdgfc transgenic mouse model [17] and that PDGF-CC mediates renal interstitial fibrosis [18]. Increased expression of PDGF-CC has additionally been observed in experimental models of heart and lung fibrosis [19, 20]. PDGF-CC has been shown to mediate angiogenic and tumorigenic properties of fibroblasts associated with tumours refractory to anti-VEGF treatment [21]. Notably, in preclinical models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, siRNA-mediated reduction of PDGF-CC expression levels reversed resistance to cisplatin and thus improved the therapeutic effect [22].",
                "PDGF-CC has been recognized as a regulator of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. It has been shown that intraventricular injection of active PDGF-CC protein is sufficient for disrupting the BBB [23]. Moreover, inhibition of the PDGF-CC/PDGFR\u03b1 axis reduced BBB dysfunction and has beneficial therapeutic effects in animal models of stroke [23\u201325], spinal cord injury [26], multiple sclerosis [27], traumatic brain injury [28], seizures [29] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [30]. Recently, a phase 2 clinical trial in human ischemic stroke subjects treated with thrombolysis and the PDGFR\u03b1 inhibitor imatinib, showed significant improvements in clinical outcome compared to thrombolysis alone [31].",
                "Molecular tools specific for targeting PDGF-CC signalling are still missing, and we aimed to generate high affinity monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suitable for functional assessment of PDGF-CC signalling with a potential for therapeutic use [32]. For that purpose we have generated and characterized mAbs against human PDGF-CC and assessed their binding specificities, affinities and complementarity-determining regions (CDR). We demonstrated their ability to neutralize PDGF-CC mediated activation of PDGFR\u03b1. We have also investigated the expression pattern of PDGF-CC in human primary tumours and control tissues. Taken together, the properties of our high affinity mAbs indicate that they are potentially useful for the treatment of various PDGF-CC related pathologies in cancer, fibrosis, and CNS diseases."

Immunizations and generation of hybridomas were carried out by the EMBL monoclonal antibody facility, Rome, Italy (http://www.macf.embl.de). 16 hybridomas reacting strongly with PDGF-CC in both ELISA and immuno blots (WBs) were selected. The hybridomas were grown in HM20 medium containing DMEM (Gibco, 41965\u2013039) and supplemented with 20% FBS (Gibco, 10437\u2013036), 50 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Gibco, 15757\u2013037), 200 mM L-glutamate (Gibco, 25030\u2013024) and 10% HCF (hybridoma cloning factor, BioVeris Corporation, Ca: 210001) at 37\u00b0C, with 5% CO2. The hybridomas were subcloned by serial dilution and expanded. To purify the mAb IgGs, the expanded cultures were grown in reduced serum media. To avoid unspecific IgG contamination from FCS, we used Ultra-Low IgG FBS (Gibco, 16250) in the culture medium. The purification was carried out using HiTrap-Protein G columns (GE Healthcare, 17-0404-01). The collected media was passed through the column and nonspecific binding was removed by washing with PBS. The elution was carried out using a 0.1M glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0. The purified IgGs were then dialyzed against PBS."

The calculated dissociation constants for each antibody were in a low nanoMolar range, indicating that most of the antibodies have very high affinity for human PDGF-CC (Fig 1B). To further characterize the binding epitopes of the selected clones, we investigated the cross competition of mAbs for binding to immobilized PDGF-CC. Clones 6B3 and 19C7 demonstrated highly cross-competition while 11F5 showed no ability to compete with clone 6B3 and 19C7 (Fig 1C). This indicates that clone 6B3 and clone 19C7 have similar or overlapping epitopes, while 11F5 has a different epitope.",

Pre-incubation of activated human PDGF-CC with 6B3 IgG abolished phosphorylation of PAE-expressed PDGFR\u03b1, while an equivalent amount of the ligand alone lead to strong phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig 1D). Using the same experimental setting, we tested the neutralizing capacity of all other selected clones (Table 1).

The interaction between activated PDGF-CC and the 6B3 antibody was predicted (Computist Bionanotech, Scoresby, Victoria) using the Multiple Fragment Molecular Dynamics (MFMD) method previously described [38] [39]. Four putative antigen-binding sites were predicted (Fig 2A). Accordingly, we designed and synthesized peptides corresponding to the 4 identified putative binding sites (Fig 2B). Biosensor chip analysis revealed that upon pre-incubation of 6B3 with peptide 3, the binding capacity of 6B3 for immobilized PDGF-CC was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2C). This reduction was not detected with the other peptides. When peptide 3 was immobilized on the chip, application of increased concentration of 6B3 leads to increased binding (Fig 2D). These results confirmed that peptide 3 contains the epitope for 6B3."

To evaluate the localization of PDGF-CC in blood vessels, we stained consecutive sections with the blood vessel marker CD34. The specificity of 6B3 was initially assessed using the cancer cell line A549, which previously has been shown to express high levels of PDGF-CC) [40]. Here mAb 6B3 showed strong PDGF-CC immunoreactivity. PDGF-CC expression could not be detected upon omission of the primary antibody or when the primary antibody was incubated with excess PDGF-CC protein, in contrast to incubation with an unspecific antigen (Fig 3A).",

In the bladder, PDGF-CC was observed in more than 50% of urothelium. In large bowel, the glands and epithelium generally showed a weak to moderate amount of PDGF-CC, whereas lamina propria exhibited increased expression intensity. The bile ducts exhibited weaker expression intensity (Table 3). In the brain, we observed weak to moderate neuronal and glial PDGF-CC expression. In breast tissue, PDGF-CC expression was predominantly observed in myoepithelial cells, also in the ductal cells, whereas fat cells showed weak expression.",
                        "Abundant expression of Pdgfc mRNA has been reported in human heart, liver, kidney, pancreas and ovaries, in contrast to other organs/tissues [2, 40]. In line with these reports, we detected abundant expression of PDGF-CC protein in the human breast, liver, kidney, pancreas, uterus, ovaries and prostate (Fig 3). In the human heart, we observed a weak expression of PDGF-CC in the myocardium and in some blood vessels (Table 3 and Fig 3). In the kidney, we detected widespread PDGF-CC expression in tubular epithelial cells and a weaker signal in the parietal cells of Bowmans capsule in the glomeruli. Moderate to strong expression intensity was observed in hepatocytes, again in concordance with a previous mRNA analysis [40]. In control pancreas, the acini exhibited a widespread moderate to strong expression intensity, in contrast to a weak expression in the ducts. In the thyroid gland, PDGF-CC was predominantly expressed in follicular epithelium and partially in vessels. Finally, in uterus, PDGF-CC was highly expressed throughout the whole organ (Table 3).",

The protein was detectable in the cytoplasm of stromal compartments, in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumour cells, and in blood vessels. Notably, more than 75% of the tumours analysed showed moderate to strong PDGF-CC expression (Table 4). Control parenchyma including blood vessels had markedly decreased expression intensity compared to the respective tumour tissue (Table 5). Furthermore, the amount of positively stained cells was reduced in control compared to tumour tissue (Table 5). The difference in PDGF-CC expression between control and the respective tumour tissue was evaluated using a modified H-Score system [34] revealing increased PDGF-CC expression in epithelial tissues of bladder (p = 0.039), brain gliosarcoma (p<0.001), breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (p = 0.006), renal cell cancer (p = 0.008), colon (p<0.001), pancreas (p<0.001) and prostate adenocarcinoma (p = 0.001) (Table 5)."

We generated chimeric 6B3 (ch6B3) and characterized its biological and functional activity. We show that the CDR sequence of the generated ch6B3 differed only by one amino acid at the variable heavy chain in comparison to the original 6B3 (Fig 5A). Chimeric 6B3 recognized human PDGF-CC equally well in both reduced and non-reduced condition (Fig 5B). As expected, ch6B3 specifically binds to PDGF-CC but not to any other PDGF ligands (Fig 5C). To reveal whether it has the capacity to block PDGF-CC induced phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1, we performed a receptor stimulation assay using PDGFR\u03b1 expressing PAE cells. Upon pre-incubation of ch6B3 with human PDGF-CC, we verified that the ligand was unable to induce phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1 similar to what we observed with the original 6B3 mAb (Fig 5D).",

To assess whether ch6B3 could be used in vivo for both functional assays and ultimately for development into a humanized mAb for therapeutic applications, we explored if ch6B3 could block PDGF-CC induced opening of the blood retinal barrier (BRB) following intraocular injection of active PDGF-CC into the vitreous of the mouse eye. The integrity of the BRB was assessed by injecting tetramethylrhodamine-labeled 70-kDa dextran (TMR-Dex) into mouse-tail vein. The BRB integrity was evaluated by measuring tracer extravasation into the perivascular tissue. Intraocular injection of active human PDGF-CC, but not PBS, induced extravasation of TMR-Dex from the blood vessels into the perivascular tissue (Fig 5E). In contrast, when ch6B3 was injected intraperitoneally prior to the intraocular injection of active human PDGF-CC, no extravasation of the tracer was observed (Fig 5E). Hence, a single injection of ch6B3 was sufficient to cross the compromised BRB and prevent PDGF-CC induced opening of the BRB."

However, there are still no approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against PDGF-CC. We therefore aimed to develop both murine anti-human mAbs, and a chimeric anti-human mAb targeting PDGF-CC. We selected and extensively characterized the lead mAbs, 6B3 and ch6B3, that neutralize PDGF-CC-induced PDGFR\u03b1 activation, and BRB disruption in vivo, in order to develop a potential novel agent against PDGF-CC-related malignancies and neuropathologies. This is to our knowledge the first study reporting specific mAbs against human PDGF-CC including in vivo assessment of their functionality.",
                "The mAbs against PDGF-CC were generated from purified recombinant PDGF-CC protein. Specificity and binding affinity against the antigen have been evaluated. Although protein sequence of human and mouse PDGF-CC are 87% identical to (in the conserved GFD domain up to 90%) our mAb recognized human, and not mouse PDGF-CC in the assays we tested.",
                "Despite the fact that PDGF-CC was discovered almost two decades ago, the detailed expression pattern in healthy and tumour tissue in humans has not been systematically reported yet. This is of utmost importance as PDGF-CC is crucial for tumour progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. We here used our novel mAb 6B3 to systematically screen various tumour and respective control tissues.",
                "We assessed the expression pattern of PDGF-CC in human epithelial cells, stroma and in blood vessels (Tables 3 and 4). Notably, PDGF-CC was found in both epithelial and stromal cells, and showed a gradually increased expression upon tumour transformation. High Pdgfc mRNA [2] and PDGF-CC protein levels in the parietal epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsule, tubular epithelial cells, and in arterial endothelial cells were described previously using a polyclonal antibody [43]. Dijkmans et al. reported PDGFC mRNA expression in a range of human control tissues including heart, kidney, pancreas, small intestine, spleen, testes, thymus, brain, colon and lung [40]. However, they did not observe any obvious upregulation of Pdgfc mRNA in the tumour cell lines.",
                "We could detect significantly increased PDGF-CC expression in stroma of both breast infiltrating duct carcinoma (IDC) (p = 0.039) and breast infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) (p = 0.006) compared to control breast tissue. In addition, we observed a trend for increased PDGF-CC levels in stroma of prostate tumour (p = 0.08). Notably, PDGF-CC expression could not be evaluated in all tissue types due to the lack of stroma (Tables 3 and 4). In blood vessels significantly increased PDGF-CC levels were detected in bladder, brain, breast, colon, kidney, pancreas and prostate tumour biopsies compared to the respective control tissue (p<0.0001). Upregulation of PDGF-CC observed in the blood vessels indicates a potential role of this protein in tumour angiogenesis [44, 45]. In line with increased PDGF-CC expression in various tumours analysed in our study, it has been previously shown that PDGF-CC upregulation correlates with poorer prognosis of breast cancer, [46] colorectal cancer, [47] and glioma [48]. Moreover, activation of PDGF-CC promoted breast cancer metastases to bone [49]. Together with these observations, our data on PDGF-CC upregulation in the tumour samples strongly indicate relevance of targeting PDGF-CC for treating these pathologies.",
                "We could detect increased PDGF-CC expression in breast infiltrating duct carcinomas (IDC) compared to breast infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC). Interestingly ILC tend to be slower growing and less aggressive than IDC and patients with ILC tend to have a better prognosis than those with IDC [50, 51]. In this respect it is interesting that pharmacological intervention of PDGF-CC activity with 6B3 in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model on SCID mice resulted in significant reduction of tumour size and micro-vascular density of about 30%. Most importantly 6B3 treatment led to conversion of poorly treatable basal-like breast cancers into a hormone receptor-positive state that enhanced sensitivity to endocrine therapy [52]. However PDGF-CC expression was not increased in glioblastoma, a very aggressive brain tumour [53]. A further analysis with a greater number of tumour samples together with relevant clinical information would be needed to explore the hypothesis whether PDGF-CC is higher expressed in more aggressive tumour types.",
                "It has been demonstrated that overexpression of PDGF-CC results in liver fibrosis, steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in a Pdgfc transgenic mouse model [17]. As a majority of the control livers exhibited fibrosis or steatosis, we could not detect any statistical difference compared to the expression levels in hepatocellular carcinomas.",
                "The BBB represents a dynamic interface between the central nervous system (CNS), the blood and the immune system. Since disruption of the BBB integrity is a common and significant event in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, many efforts have been made for targeting mechanisms responsible for loss of the barrier integrity. We have previously reported that the PDGF-CC/PDGFR\u03b1 axis controls the integrity of the BBB [23, 28]. Intraventricular injection of active PDGF-CC protein was sufficient to induce BBB opening [23]. Treatment with the small molecule inhibitor imatinib, which was shown to inhibit PDGFRs, was able to reduce BBB dysfunction in both acute and progressive experimental neuropathology models [23, 26\u201330]. Recently, we performed a phase II randomized trial with imatinib in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis [31]. We could show that imatinib significantly improved neurological outcomes with an improvement of 0.6 NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) points per 100 mg imatinib given. For the high dose group, the mean adjusted NIHSS improvements were even 5 points in comparison to controls.",
                "Capillary loss and increased permeability of the BRB are among the earliest symptoms of diabetic retinopathy and treatment of the compromised BRB has been reported to ameliorate the symptoms [54]. We therefore aimed to determine the neutralizing capacity of the ch6B3 mAb in vivo using a BRB permeability assay. Indeed, intraocular PDGF-CC injection into the mouse eye induced disruption of the BRB, whereas intraperitoneal pretreatment with ch6B3 resulted in an intact BRB in contrast to the control retina injected with PBS (Fig 5E). The impact of PDGF-CC on vascular permeability, occurring within 1h, leads to increased leakage of antibodies from the blood stream out into the retina explaining the strong effect of the neutralizing antibody to inhibit vascular leakage, compared to the isotype control experiments. Thus, our data demonstrate high efficacy of circulating ch6B3 in blocking PDGF-CC-mediated PDGFR\u03b1 signalling, indicating a possibility for in vivo targeting of PDGF-CC signalling for therapeutic purposes."
