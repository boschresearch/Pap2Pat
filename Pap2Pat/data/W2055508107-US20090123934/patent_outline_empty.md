## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### The Mtrm Gene Encodes a 217 Amino Acid Protein Whose Expression is Limited to the Period Between the End of Pachytene and the Onset of NEB

### Reducing the Dosage of the Polo+ Gene Suppresses the Chromosome Segregation Defects Observed in Mtrm/+ Heterozygotes

### Increasing the Dosage of Polo+ Partially Mimics the Effects of Mtrm and Enhances The Defects Observed In Mtrm/+ Heterozygotes

### Mtrm and Polo Physically Interact In Vivo

### Mtrm Functions as an Inhibitor of Polo

### As Either a Heterozygote or a Homozygote, Mtrm Causes Precocious Nuclear Envelope Breakdown

### The Defects in Karyosome Maintenance are Followed by Defective Co-Orientation of Achiasmate Centromeres on the Meiotic Spindle

### Polo Plays a Critical Role in Initiating the G2/M Transition in Oogenesis by Regulating Cdc25

### Mtrm Inhibition of Polo
