### The Mtrm Gene Encodes a 217 Amino Acid Protein Whose Expression is Limited to the Period Between the End of Pachytene and the Onset of NEB

- describe Mtrm gene and its expression

### Reducing the Dosage of the Polo+ Gene Suppresses the Chromosome Segregation Defects Observed in Mtrm/+ Heterozygotes

- describe genetic interaction between Mtrm and Polo

### Increasing the Dosage of Polo+ Partially Mimics the Effects of Mtrm and Enhances The Defects Observed In Mtrm/+ Heterozygotes

- describe effect of increasing Polo dosage on meiotic defects

### Mtrm and Polo Physically Interact In Vivo

- confirm Mtrm-Polo interaction through co-immunoprecipitation
- demonstrate Mtrm-Polo interaction through MudPIT mass spectrometry

### Mtrm Functions as an Inhibitor of Polo

- argue Mtrm inhibits Polo function through multiple lines of evidence

### As Either a Heterozygote or a Homozygote, Mtrm Causes Precocious Nuclear Envelope Breakdown

- show precocious NEB in mtrm/+ and mtrm/mtrm oocytes
- demonstrate dosage-dependent effect of Mtrm on NEB timing
- link Mtrm-Polo interaction to NEB regulation

### The Defects in Karyosome Maintenance are Followed by Defective Co-Orientation of Achiasmate Centromeres on the Meiotic Spindle

- describe karyosome maintenance defects and centromere co-orientation abnormalities

### Polo Plays a Critical Role in Initiating the G2/M Transition in Oogenesis by Regulating Cdc25

- discuss Polo's role in activating Cdc25 and initiating G2/M transition
