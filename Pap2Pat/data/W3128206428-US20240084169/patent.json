To achieve superhydrophobicity, the general strategy is to create micro-/nano-structures using materials of low surface tension. Existing coating methods reported to date rely on either replicating pre-existing \u201crough\u201d structures or creating roughness on existing materials via multi-step procedures. However, the limited availability of ideal natural templates and accessible fabrication procedures is a significant challenge to achieving superhydrophobicity.",

Its fluorine-free composition minimizes potential environmental and health hazards. Conventionally, chlorosilane derivatives are reputed to vigorously react with even trace amounts of water and create large aggregates that are futile for obtaining high-quality monolayer coatings. Thus, when adopting chlorosilanes for surface modification, a rigorously controlled humidity is generally required. However, for OTS, its C18 long alkyl chain can sterically reduce the reaction rate when exposed to water or moisture. With the reaction being kinetically controllable, the present Example unorthodoxly harnesses the aggregation of OTS to create the desired surface coating upon reacting with a stoichiometric amount of water. Different from existing studies, the stoichiometric reaction between OTS and water explored herein not only creates the required hierarchical micro/nanostructures but also results in low surface tension. Superhydrophobicity can be achieved in a single step with an organotrihalosilane as the only precursor (vide infra) besides water and solvent for dilution. This present Example is conceptually different from conventional sol-gel processes, for which less-reactive organosilanes (e.g., tetraethoxysilane) were mixed with a bulk amount of water to create solid materials.",

                                "The morphology of the treated samples was imaged with a FEI Nova NanoSEM 430 system (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). The substrates were first sputtered with iridium (5 nm) with a Leica EM ACE600 (Wetzlar, Germany) deposition chamber to improve the conductivity. The cross-section view of the samples was obtained either using a FEI Strata DualBeam DB235 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) or a FEI Helios NanoLab 650 SEM/FIB System. The substrates were coated with carbon (15 nm) in this case. During the imaging, the samples were tilted for 52\u00b0 following by a gallium ion beam (30 pA) cutting for 15 min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out with a FEI Tecnai Osiris S/TEM (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) at 200 kV. The nanospheres were prepared as described herein, then dissolved in hexane and transferred to a Cu-grid for imaging.",

                        "The coating mixture was prepared by directly reacting water with pure OTS, followed by dilution with hexane. As shown in FIG. 1A, the consecutive photos depicted a trial experiment of adding water to OTS with a mole ratio of 1:2, for example, 40 \u03bcL (2.2 micromole) of water was required for 2.0 mL of OTS (4.4 micromole), which was exactly \u2153 of the amount of water needed to complete the hydrolysis of OTS. The addition of water was followed by immediate mechanical mixing, including vortex and sonication. The mixture was then diluted with hexane (5% v/v OTS/hexane) before being applied on a number of solid surfaces (vide infra). Remarkably, the reaction between water and OTS was rather mild with minimal volume increase and gas (HCl) release. The modification of standard microscope glass slides, an intrinsically flat substrate, was first investigated. As shown in FIG. 1B, a 5.0 \u03bcL of water droplet stayed as a near-perfect sphere on the surface and easily slid off. The water contact angle of the modified glass was measured to be 172\u00b11\u00b0, with an ultralow sliding angle of 0.7\u00b10.2\u00b0. The surface was also tested dynamically with a 5.0 \u03bcL water droplet at a speed of 1 m/s (momentum energy of 2.5 \u03bcJ), and the droplet bounced off the surface freely without pinning onto it. As captured by a high-speed camera, a water droplet freely jumped from one side to the other side of the superhydrophobic glass slide. Apparently, both the ultrahigh water contact angle and ultralow sliding angle (minimum wetting hysteresis) warrant the excellent water-repellency (non-sticky property) of the coated (also referred to as modified herein) glass surface.",
                        "After modification, the glass slide was covered with a layer of uniform, microparticles with diameters ranging from 2 to 20 \u03bcm (FIG. 1B). The high-resolution SEM showed that these microparticles are, in fact, formed from entangled nanofibers (150 to 200 nm in diameter and 2 to 10 \u03bcm in length), which beautifully mimicked the micro-to-nanoscale hierarchical morphology on lotus leaves. More impressively, the hierarchical model could be adapted for simulating such an extreme hydrophobicity:",
                        "cos \u03b8app=fs(L/l)D-2 cos \u03b8\u2212fv\u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "The value of D (fractal dimension) in three-dimensional space was 2.2618. For the modified glass surface (FIG. 1B), the average value of fs was estimated to be 0.2 (fv=0.8), L is 10 \u03bcm and l being 175 nm. The calculated water contact angle was 171\u00b0, which matched the experimental determination very well (172\u00b11\u00b0). This result affirmed that the extreme hydrophobicity of the modified surfaces should be attributed to the lotus-leaf like micro-to-nanoscale hierarchical roughness.",
                        "Besides the glass surface discussed herein, the coating solution could be applied to many other different materials regardless of roughness, composition and rigidity. Particularly, the coating method described herein was demonstrated on (1) paper (laboratory filter paper), (2) fabric (100% cotton shirting fabric) (3) wood (maple plywood), (4) metal (aluminum thin sheet), and (5) plastics (polyethylene terephthalate, PET) as examples. As shown in FIG. 2, all solid substrates that were treated with the coating solution resulted in high water contact angles (168-171\u00b0) and very low sliding angles (0.5\u00b0-1.0\u00b0). The aforementioned micro-to-nanoscale hierarchical structure was also confirmed on other substrates (e.g., porous filter paper, FIG. 5). Their superior water-repellency property was further illustrated with a movie to show how water droplets bounce off these treated surfaces.",
                        "Besides the superior water-repellent property, the nature of such an unconventional alkylsilane/water reaction was intriguing. As shown in FIG. 3A, an important factor was the amount of water added to the OTS, i.e., at a molar ratio of 1:2 (water:OTS) the best performance was achieved. Less or more water could lead to a decrease in the water contact angle of the treated surface. As mentioned herein, this stoichiometrically-controlled hydrolysis and condensation of OTS was conceptually different from either the monolayer formation with long-chain alkylsilanes (which is performed under a strictly controlled humidity) or the conventional sol-gel processes (which mix less-reactive organosilanes with a bulk amount of water). Although the molar ratio between the two reactants was 1:2, the volume percent of water in the mixture was only \u02dc2%. After applying mechanical dispersion, such a small amount of water mixed well with OTS and quickly decreased to submicron-to-nanometer sized droplets. This led to the formation of a stable and uniform water-OTS emulsion with the hydrophilic end of OTS molecules orienting towards water droplets and the hydrophobic chain facing outward (FIG. 6A). The continued hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of OTS consumed water and generated HCl gas, which created an acidic condition for further catalyzing the reaction. Consequently, spherical nanoparticles (100-200 nm) were formed with the surface covered with alkyl chains (FIG. 3D, FIG. 7A, and FIGS. 8A and 8B). Next, nanoparticles tend to form head-to-head linear fibers (FIG. 3E and FIG. 7B), because of the energy barriers encountered during aggregation. Then, linear fibers further aggregated and eventually formed microparticles (FIG. 3F, FIG. 6B, and FIG. 7C). This silanization reaction could last for approximately 6 h (FIG. 9), although the highest water contact angle (172\u00b0) was achieved after 2 h (FIG. 3B). The continued variation of the resulting water contact angles after this point indicated that the reaction was not complete, i.e., reactive sites (\u2014Si\u2014OH or \u2014Si\u2014Cl) on the particles still existed. Therefore, micro-aggregates could covalently bond to the substrates provided that hydroxyl groups are present, i.e., the particles would bond to the surface and form hierarchical structures. In FIG. 3F, the \u201cFIB-cut\u201d cross-section of a particle that was \u201canchored\u201d on the substrate surface was shown (also shown in FIG. 7D and FIGS. 10A-10D).",
                        "To examine the composition of the superhydrophobic coatings, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) were acquired on modified aluminum and glass samples, respectively. The band at 1003 cm\u22121 in the FTIR spectrum was due to the bending vibration of Si\u2014O\u2014Al, which verified the formation of chemical bonding on the surface (FIG. 11). For the XPS results, the C/O/Si atomic ratio changed from 7.41/66.43/26.16% to 86.37/9.10/4.53%. The significant increase in the CIs peak intensity after the modification confirmed the existence of OTS aggregates on the surface (FIG. 12). The hypothesis for the formation of the hierarchic structure was further confirmed by adding HAuCl4 in water when preparing the coating mixture to trace the entire process. The existence of gold elements was detected in the emulsion and therefore verified the presence of water (FIGS. 10A and B) in the fibers formed from siloxane particles. Meanwhile, in between particles, the surface was covered with small particles (FIGS. 10C and 10D). The entire reaction was performed in a controlled manner. The other important fabrication step was the dilution of the stock solution (FIG. 1A), which could utilize common organic solvents (hexane or mineral spirit) of preference. As shown in FIG. 3C the optimal concentration of the dilution was determined to be 5.0% (v/v). This relatively low concentration enables the potential for large-scale fabrication of the coating.",
                        "As mentioned herein, gold nanoparticles could be encapsulated in the coating (FIGS. 10A-10D). To further test and visualize this capability, water-soluble fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B) was tested as a trial luminescent chromophore. The ring-open structure of Rhodamine B makes the molecule polar and soluble in water but not in organic solvents. The solution of Rhodamine B (30 mM), instead of pure water, was added to the OTS in the procedure mentioned herein (FIG. 1A) and the coating mixture was then applied onto laboratory filter paper. The resulted surface displayed a pink color under ambient light; the color remains after washing with water and organic solvents, which indicating that the dye molecules were not physically adsorbed on the surface. As shown in FIG. 4A, a water droplet (dyed with a different water-soluble fluorescent dye, pyranine) sat perfectly atop, which confirmed the unperturbed superhydrophobicity (FIG. 4A, left photo). It was more remarkable that under UV light (\u03bb=254 nm), this superhydrophobic filter paper displayed bright red emission, while strong green fluorescence observed from the water droplet (right picture of FIG. 4A). The reflections from air bubbles trapped under the water droplet validated the Cassie-Baxter wetting state. The fact that the encapsulation of chromophores did not influence either ultrahigh water contact angle or the sliding angle, warranted application potentials such as designing colorful and luminescent waterproof coatings.",
                        "The other intriguing property of superhydrophobic surfaces was the self-cleaning capability, which could be adapted to various daily life scenarios such as building construction, clothing, and machining materials. In FIG. 4B, a series of photos taken at different timeframes demonstrated that a water droplet readily rolled off a slightly tilted (\u02dc0.75\u00b0) glass slide prepared as described herein and carried away dust (MnO particles) from the coated surface.",
                        "In addition to the application versatility, mechanical stability was considered as a vital criterion for surface coatings. To apply the coating in daily life, superhydrophobic surfaces were desired to survive under harsh weather conditions. The mechanical stability of surface coatings was tested by sand abrasion and water jetting experiments. As shown in FIG. 4C, the modified superhydrophobic glass substrate remained superhydrophobic (>160\u00b0) after sand abrasion (4.5 kJ) for 10 min or water jetting (90 kJ) for 10 min. It was also confirmed that water immersing for three days and tissue wiping for 20 times did not change the surface hydrophobicity significantly (i.e., the water contact angle is maintained above 150\u00b0. An abrasion test, in which the modified glass substrate was pressed onto a piece of silicon carbide sandpaper (Grit No. 400) under a pressure of 2.5 kPa, and then abraded for a distance of 50 cm was also conducted (FIG. 13). The glass slide retained a high contact angle (161\u00b12\u00b0) and a low sliding angle (\u02dc1\u00b0) after the abrasion test. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that such an exceptional anti-abrasion property could be explained by covalently bound siloxane aggregates on the surface. As shown in FIG. 3F and FIGS. 14A-14D, the SEM image with a FIB cut showed that the hierarchical particles and the solid substrate were \u201cmerged\u201d together due to the continued formation of siloxane compounds (as discussed herein). The chemical bonding provided higher stability compared with physical adsorption or deposition, leading to the strengthened robustness of the superhydrophobic coating. In addition, the anti-abrasion property could be also attributed to the fiber-entangled porous structure of the micro-size particles. As illustrated with SEM imaging (FIGS. 15A-15D), the abrasion test partially removed entangled nanofibers at the top surface, but the substrate was still coated with similar hierarchical nano/microstructures. That is, the remaining structure resembled the original surface prior to abrasion (FIG. 16). Thus, the combination of chemical bonding and self-similar structural strategy could achieve the superior anti-abrasion property shown in the present Example. Such mechanically robust coating is useful for building and ship construction, and outdoor gear, which typically sustains harsh conditions from wind, rain, or wear and tear. Further, the coating is also thermally stable. After subjecting coated samples to 50\u00b0 C. for two weeks, the water contact angle remained high, averaging 157.8\u00b0.",
                        "The coating method can be scaled industrially, which is a key factor in practice. To mimic the mass production of such coating in clothing industry, a cotton T-shirt was treated with the coating solution and exhibited an excellent water repellency (FIG. 4D). Water (with green dye) readily bounced off the surface, leaving the T-shirt clean and dry. It was noteworthy that the superhydrophobic fabrics retained good air permittivity, augmenting the potential to make commercial waterproof, breathable coating products from porous and flexible materials. FIGS. 17A-17C demonstrates gas penetration into a fabric, where the generated H2S gas could penetrate through the fabric, reach the other side of fabric, react with CuSO4 and form the dark color CuS.",
                        "A comparison of two alternative application methods was carried out: dipping the substrate into the coating solution and spraying the coating solution onto the substrate. For any same type of solid materials, no significant differences were observed in the wetting performance when different methods were used to prepare the samples. Different organic solvents were tested (FIG. 18) were tested for the preparation of a spray solution, and it was found that the wetting performance was better using solvents with lower polarity. A widely used spray coating solvent, mineral spirit, was employed in an exemplary dilution step (FIG. 1A-4). The performance of the spray coated samples was compared with coating products from several commercial brands, namely Wood\u2122, Grangers\u00ae, Kiwi\u00ae, Nikwax\u00ae, Neverwet\u2122 and Scotchgard\u2122, on glass and cotton fabrics. The surfaces treated with the coating solution of the present Example (sprayed and air dried for 2 h) showed superior waterproof properties, and superhydrophobicity was achieved on both types of material (162\u00b0-165\u00b0). On the other hand, the tested commercial products reached the level of hydrophobicity (900 to 120\u00b0). The coating solution was also sprayed on a large piece of pine wood (0.3 m\u00d70.5 m) to further demonstrate the scale-up capability; as shown in FIG. 4D (right), water would not stick to the treated wood surface and ran off readily.",
                        "The aging effect, anti-icing property, and cost-effectiveness of the coating solution were examined. After exposure to ambient conditions for 18 months, the coating applied on a number of surfaces demonstrated no sign of degradation. Particularly, treated cotton fabric and plywood samples tested after various periods of storage time consistently remained superhydrophobic (FIG. 19).",
                        "The cost for producing large waterproof surfaces with the present coating method was inexpensive since there were no intricate instrumentation nor expensive materials involved in the production process. It was estimated that more than 100 kg of the coating solution could be produced with a material cost of about 300 US$ and the production could be carried out per operator on a daily basis under ambient conditions. Furthermore, this new protocol is based on a simple, mild hydrolysis and condensation reaction of organosilanes. The only byproduct is HCl gas, which could be recycled for producing the precursor. Therefore, there is minimal environmental impact, and the simple synthesis and instrument-free production warrant large-scale industrial production.",
                        "Comparing with other state-of-the-art coating methods, the present method used only OTS and water to create hierarchical micro/nanostructure template with low surface tension in a single step and demonstrated superior wettability and anti-abrasion property compared to existing technology. In comparison, most other existing strategies relied on the modification of \u201cpre-made\u201d rough structures with low surface tension coatings. Therefore, with the present unique stoichiometric salinization approach the fabrication procedure is simplified, the chemical reagents are readily accessible, and the preparation is scalable for industrial applications.",
                        "Other alkyltrichlorosilanes were also tested to compare the resulting wetting property of treated samples with that of OTS. It was found that alkyltrichlorosilanes with slightly shorter chains, namely hexadecyltrichlorosilane (HTS, C16) and dodecyltrichlorosilane (DTS, C12), could be adapted with the same protocol developed for OTS to modify various solid substrates. The much shorter ones, such as methyltrichlorosilane (MTS), were more reactive and could be used with the exact same protocol. A summary of the resulting wettability for filter paper modified with alkyltrichlorosilanes of varying chain lengths was presented in FIG. 20. The stoichiometric silanization with HTS (C16) and DTS (C12) could modify filter papers to be hydrophobic (137\u00b15\u00b0 and 125\u00b16\u00b0). The modification with other types of organosilanes (e.g., trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane, trimethoxyoctadecylsilane) was explored as well, however, their hydrolysis reaction was too slow; for example, they could not effectively form micelles in the presence of the stochiometric amount of water.",
                        "Anti-icing property was investigated. The tests indicated that ice formed with the same amount of water (30 \u03bcL) had less contact with the modified superhydrophobic substrate (FIGS. 21A and 21B), the adhesive force decreased \u02dc30%, from 895\u00b169 kPa to 636\u00b136 kPa. The present coating therefore exhibited anti-icing property.",
                        "In summary, the developed superhydrophobic coating technique, based on an unconventional, stoichiometrically controlled aggregation of organosilanes, was a versatile and practical method for surface modification at industrial scales for real-life applications. This protocol removed many limitations of existing waterproof coating methods, such as expensive materials and time-consuming preparation procedures.",
