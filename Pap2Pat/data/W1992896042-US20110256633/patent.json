    "date": "2009-12-07 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method for screening a cancer therapeutic agent, comprising the steps of: (a) contacting a test substance of interest with a cell containing a granulogenic factor-encoding nucleotide sequence; and (b) analyzing expression of the granulogenic factor or production of secretory granules, wherein the test substance is determined as the cancer therapeutic agent where it inhibits the expression of the granulogenic factor or the production of secretory granules. In the present invention, the expression of the granulogenic factor contributes to induction of secretory granule formation in non-secretory cells, and inhibition of the granulogenic factor expression leads to inhibition of secretory granule formation in secretory cells. In addition, the secretory granules produced by the present granulogenic factor change cell activities via the IP3-dependent cellular Ca2+ regulatory mechanism, and the changes of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis will affect the development and proliferation of cancer cells. Therefore, a pharmaceutical composition containing as an active ingredient a substance which inhibits expression of a granulogenic factor gene, production of secretory granules, or activity of the granulogenic factor may be utilized in cancer prophylaxis or treatment, and also be used as a kit for identifying a cancer.",

                        "The present invention relates to biomarkers for cancer treatment and a screening method using the same, pharmaceutical compositions for cancer prophylaxis or treatment, and a kit for identifying cancers.",
                        "2. Description of the Related Art",
                        "Glial cells in the brain are thought to play essential roles in cellular communication not only among themselves but also with the neighboring neurons, thereby nurturing and nourishing the communication networks in the brain (Panatier et al. 2006; Montana et al. 2006; Angulo et al. 2004; Fellin et al. 2006; Perea and Araque 2005; Volterra and Meldolesi 2005; Haydon and Carmignoto 2006). The glial astrocytes are known to store and release a variety of signal molecules in a Ca2+-dependent regulated exocytotic pathway (Martineau et al. 2008; Bezzi et al. 2004; Coco et al. 2003; Krzan et al. 2003; Montana et al. 2004; Potokar et al. 2008; Parpura and Haydon 2000; Kreft et al. 2004; Santello and Volterra 2009). Hence the exocytotic secretory vesicles in astrocytes are viewed as essential in the cell-to-cell communication although the identity of molecules that are stored in different types of secretory vesicles in astrocytes is only partially known. There exist generally two types of secretory vesicles in astrocytes; one being the small transparent synaptic-like vesicles and the other the large dense-core vesicles (Bezzi et al. 2004; Crippa et al. 2006; Maienschein et al. 1999; Ramamoorthy and Whim 2008). Due to extensive studies in neurons the small translucent synaptic-like vesicles of astrocytes have attracted more attention than large dense-core vesicles in the past.",
                        "Nevertheless, the large dense-core vesicles of glial cell astrocytes have been shown to contain a number of molecules including ATP, glutamate, neuropeptides, and secretogranin II (Calegari et al. 1999; Coco et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2005; Ramamoorthy and Whim 2008; Striedinger et al. 2007). Along with chromogranins A (CGA) and B (CGB), which are two major members of the granin protein family and are prototypical marker proteins of secretory granules (Helle 2000; Montero-Hadjadje et al. 2008; Taupenot et al. 2003; Winkler and Fischer-Colbrie 1992; Huttner et al. 1991), secretogranin II (SgII) is a third member of the granin protein family and is also a typical secretory granule marker protein (Huttner et al. 1991). The presence of SgII in the large dense-core vesicles identifies the dense-core vesicles as typical secretory granules and demonstrates the presence of bona-fide secretory granules in astrocytes. Moreover, Bergmann glial cells have also been shown to contain chromogranin A (McAuliffe and Hess 1990). The molecules stored in the large dense-core vesicles including SgII and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were shown to be released in response to appropriate stimuli in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Chen et al. 2005; Coco et al. 2003; Ramamoorthy and Whim 2008; Striedinger et al. 2007), thus confirming participation of secretory granules in secretory function of astrocytes.",
                        "Not only do chromogranins A and B, and secretogranin II serve as marker proteins of secretory granules, they also function as high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+ storage proteins, binding 30-93 molecules of Ca2+/mol with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.5-4.0 mM (Yoo et al. 2001; Yoo and Albanesi 1991; Yoo et al, 2007). In secretory granules of bovine chromaffin cells, there exist 2-3 mM of the granin proteins, thereby enabling secretory granules to store \u02dc40 mM Ca2+ (Haigh et al. 1989; Hutton 1989). As a result, secretory granules are the subcellular organelle that contains the most calcium in all types of secretory cells. As is the case with other secretory cells, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) of astrocytes plays essential roles in the regulated exocytosis of active molecules from both the small synaptic-like vesicles and the large secretory granules, and the increase in [Ca2+]i is thought to be primarily contributed by the IP3-dependent releases from intracellular stores (Araque et al. 2000; Hua et al. 2004; Jeremic et al 2001).",
                        "Interestingly, secretory granules also contain large amounts of the IP3R/Ca2+ channels (Yoo et al. 2001), containing more than half the cellular IP3R/Ca2+ channels present in chromaffin cells (Huh et al. 2005c). As a result secretory granules rapidly release Ca2+ in response to IP3 (Gerasimenko et al. 1996;Nguyen et al. 1998;Yoo and Albanesi 1990), and function as the major IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store in neuroendocrine cells (Huh et al. 2006;Huh et al. 2005b). The IP3-dependent Ca2+ store role of secretory granules is now widely observed in many different types of secretory cells (Gerasimenko et al. 2006; Quesada et al. 2003; Quesada et al. 2001; Santodomingo et al. 2008; Srivastava et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2006).",

Transient siRNA transfection was performed with 70-80% confluent cultures. The CGA-siRNA duplex sense and antisense sequences are 5\u2032-CAACAACAACACAGCAGCUdTdT-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-dTdTGUUGUUGUUGUGUCGUC GA -5\u2032, respectively, and the CGB-siRNA duplex sense and antisense sequences are 5\u2032-AUGCCCUAUCCAAGUCCAGdTdT-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-dTdTUACGGGAUAGGUUCAGGUC-5\u2032, respectively. The 2-nucleotide 3\u2032-overhang of 2\u2032-deoxythymidine is indicated as dTdT. The cells were transfected with the siRNAs using Silencer\u2122 siRNA transfection kit (Ambion). Briefly, approximately 1\u22122\u00d7106 PC12 cells were plated on collagen type IV (BD Biosciences) coated culture dish (100 mm in diameter) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and were cultured for 48 h before transfection. For dose-response experiments of siRNA transfection, 0.25-2 pg of appropriate siRNA and 10 \u03bcl siPORT Amine were used per 5\u00d7105 cells. But for the EM study, 1 \u03bcg of appropriate siRNA and 10 \u03bcl siPORT Amine were used per 5\u00d7105 cells. Addition of more siRNA did not reduce the number of secretory granules further. The transfection was performed for 6 h at 37\u00b0 C. After transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh pre-warmed RPMI 1640 medium, and was further incubated for 48 h. The transfection was monitored using Silencer CyTM3 siRNA Labeling Kit, and the electron microscope experiments using the transfected PC12 cells were performed 48 h after transfection."

                                "In our attempt to find the basis for differences between the normal and GBM brain tissues, we have examined and compared the brain tissue samples from the cancerous and noncancerous regions (obtained by lobectomy) of the brains by electron microscopy. As shown in FIG. 1, in astrocytes of normal brain tissues we could normally observe 0-3 secretory granule-like vesicles (large dense-core vesicles) in one picture image that encloses the cell body of an astrocyte (FIG. 1A), but occasionally we could observe 2-3 secretory granule-like vesicles in an image of a cell process (FIG. 1B), giving the impression that the secretory granule-like vesicles are more likely to be found in the cell processes than in the cell body of normal astrocytes.",
                                "To determine the identity of the secretory granule-like vesicles in astrocytes, we have investigated the potential localization of secretory granule marker proteins chromogranin B and secretogranin II in the secretory granule-like vesicles by immunogold electron microscopy using antibodies specific for chromogranin B (FIG. 2A) and secretogranin II (FIG. 2B). Chromogranins A and B, and secretogranin II are granulogenic factors that induce formation of secretory granules in the cells they are expressed (Beuret et al. 2004; Huh et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2001). Hence, the granin proteins are found in secretory granules of virtually all types of secretory cells, thus entitling them as secretory granule marker proteins (Huttner et al. 1991). Although chromogranins A and B are two major members of the granin protein family (Helle 2000; Montero-Hadjadje et al. 2008; Taupenot et al. 2003; Winkler and Fischer-Colbrie 1992; Huttner et al. 1991), chromogranin B is more abundant in secretory granules of humans.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 2A, chromogranin B was present in the secretory granule-like vesicles in addition to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Being a secretory protein CGB localizes to the ER before traveling to the Golgi and on to secretory granules, but it is known to be absent in mitochondria (Huh et al. 2005a). Consistent with the previous results that showed absence of the granin proteins in mitochondria (Huh et al. 2005a; Huh et al. 2003; Huttner et al. 1991; Winkler and Fischer-Colbrie 1992), chromogranin B was absent in mitochondria. The expression of CGB in the secretory granule-like vesicles confirms that these large dense core vesicles are bona fide secretory granules. The chromogranin-containing secretory granules in secretory cells are usually large, with sizes varying from 200 nm to 500 nm in diameter, but with an average diameter of \u02dc300 nm (Huh et al. 2005a; Coupland 1968). Likewise, the average diameter of secretory granules of normal astrocytes appeared to be \u02dc300 nm, which is consistent with the results shown in other study (Chen et al. 2005). In addition, another secretory granule marker protein secretogranin II was also expressed in the secretory granule-like vesicles (FIG. 2B), confirming the identity of the secretory granule-like vesicles as secretory granules. Secretogranin II also localized to the ER as expected but was absent in mitochondria consistent with the previous results (Park et al, 2002). The relative abundance of CGB- and SgII-labeling gold particles per unit area of secretory granules compared to that of the ER (cf. Tables 1 and 2) suggests expression of relatively large amounts of CGB and SgII in secretory granules of astrocytes.",
                                "However, the results obtained from glioblastoma multiforme tissues were quite different from those of normal brain tissues. In stark contrast to the low number (0-3 per image) of secretory granules in astrocytes of normal brain tissues there were drastic increases in the number of secretory granule-like vesicles in both the cell body (FIG. 3A) and the processes (FIG. 3B) of astrocytes from GBM. The increase in the number of secretory granule-like vesicles in astrocytes of glioblastoma tissues was so dramatic that the cytoplasm of glioblastoma astrocytes in some images appeared to be full of secretory granule-like vesicles (Hg. 3, A and B). The identity of these secretory granule-like vesicles was again examined by the immunogold electron microscopy using the antibodies specific for chromogranin B (FIG. 4A) and secretogranin II (FIG. 4B). As shown in FIG. 4A, chromogranin B was present in the secretory granule-like vesicles in addition to its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum though it was absent in mitochondria. Likewise, secretogranin II was also localized in the secretory granule-like vesicles (FIG. 4B), but again was absent in mitochondria, thereby further confirming the identity of the secretory granule-like vesicles as secretory granules.",
                                "The distribution of the CGB- or SgII-labeling gold particles in the subcellular organelles in the astrocytes of both normal and glioblastoma brain tissues is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the number of CGB-labeling gold particles per \u03bcm2 of secretory granule area in normal astrocytes was 12.38 while that per \u03bcm2 of mitochondria was 0.37, a background number, thus clearly demonstrating the presence of CGB in secretory granules. Likewise, the number of CGB-labeling gold particles per \u03bcm2 of secretory granule area in GBM astrocytes was 11.98 while that per \u03bcm2 of mitochondria was 0.36, further confirming the presence of CGB in secretory granules regardless of the pathogenic state of the astrocytes.",
                                "Analogous to CGB, the number of SgII-labeling gold particles per \u03bcm2 of secretory granule area in normal astrocytes was 10.31 while that per \u03bcm2 of mitochondria was 0.39 (Table 2), a background number, thereby clearly indicating the presence of SgII in secretory granules. Likewise, the number of SgII-labeling gold particles per \u03bcm2 secretory granule area in GBM astrocytes was 8.70 while that per \u03bcm2 of mitochondria was 0.31 (Table 2), further showing the presence of SgII in secretory granules of astrocytes regardless of the pathogenic state of the brain tissues. Considering the concentrated presence of the CGB- and SgII-labeling gold particles per unit area of secretory granules compared to that of the ER, secretory granules appeared to contain relatively large amounts of CGB and SgII, as was the case in chromaffin cells (Huh et al. 2005a), in both the normal and GBM astrocytes.",
                                "The number of and the area occupied by secretory granules in astrocytes from six different normal and six different GBM tissue samples are summarized in Table 3. Of the six normal and six GBM tissue samples that are used in the present study, in three cases both the normal and GBM tissue samples came from the same patients, but the rest (3 normal, 3 GBM) are not related to each other. Approximately a half of the cell images examined is the images that contain the cell body while the other half contains the cell processes. In normal astrocytes the number of secretory granules per cell image ranged 0.18-1.86, while the surface area of secretory granules per image ranged \u02dc0.03-0.16% of the total cell image area (Table 3). On the other hand, in GBM astrocytes the number of secretory granules per cell image was 15.0-22.89, and the surface area of secretory granules per image was \u02dc2.34-3.82% of the total cell image area.",
                                "To obtain a better picture of the differences between the two groups the results in Table 3 are summarized in FIG. 5. The average number of secretory granules per cell image has increased 30-fold, changing from 0.63\u00b10.26 (mean\u00b1s.e.) in normal cells to 18.59\u00b11.23 (mean\u00b1s.e.) in GBM cells. Analogous to the increase in the number of secretory granules, the average surface area of secretory granules per cell image increased 42-fold, changing from 0.08\u00b10.02 (mean\u00b1s.e.) in normal cells to 3.37\u00b10.23 (mean\u00b1s.e.) in GBM cells. These results clearly show explosive increases in both the number of and the cell volume occupied by secretory granules in all cases of GBM astrocytes, although similar results were occasionally observed in lower grade tumors.",
                                "To determine whether the increase in the number of secretory granules can be detected by measuring the expression levels of secretory granule markers chromogranin B and secretogranin II, we have also examined the expression of CGB and SgII in the protein extracts of the normal and GBM tissues by immunoblot analysis (FIGS. 6 and 7). For this, we have chosen six normal and six GBM tissue samples that are not related to those of Table 3. As shown in FIG. 6A, chromogranin B is present in both the normal and GBM tissues, but the amounts of CGB expressed in glioblastoma tissues are significantly higher than those in normal tissues. The amounts of CGB expressed in GBM tissues are 2.7-80-fold (FIG. 6A), with an average of 10.5-fold (FIG. 6B), higher than those of normal tissues. Likewise, secretogranin II is also present in both the normal and GBM tissues (FIG. 7), and again the amounts of SgII expressed in the tumor tissues are far higher than those in normal tissues. The amounts of SgII expressed in GBM tissues are 2.5-16-fold (FIG. 7A), with an average of 7.6-fold (FIG. 7B), higher than those of normal tissues. These results indicate that the amounts of CGB and SgII expressed in glioblastoma tissues are 10.5-fold and 7.6-fold higher, respectively, than those in normal tissues, which are in accord with the increases in the number (30-fold) and the surface area (i.e., cell volume) (42-fold) of secretory granules produced in GBM astrocytes compared to those in normal astrocytes. The reason that the fold-increases of CGB and SgII expression in GBM tissues, ranging 7.6-10.5-fold, are lower than those of the number and the surface area of secretory granules, ranging 30-42-fold, of GBM astrocytes is understandable in light of the fact that the brain tissues from which the proteins are extracted consist of neurons and glial cells while the results obtained by electron microscopy are based exclusively on astrocytes of the brain tissues.",

But the number of secretory granules formed by CGB expression was \u02dc60% higher than those formed by CGA expression (Table 4), indicating the more potent granulogenic effect of chromogranin B (Huh et al. 2003). Transfection of CGA and CGB into NIH3T3 or COS-7 cells has been proven to express CGA and CGB, respectively, in the cells (FIGS. 10 and 11).",

                                "The production of secretory granules that exist in secretory cells intrinsically can also be suppressed by inhibiting the expression of chromogranins A and B. For example, the production of intrinsic secretory granules in typical secretory neuroendocrine PC12 cells was severely suppressed by inhibiting the expression of CGA or CGB in PC12 cells (FIG. 12, Table 5). The suppression of CGB expression decreased the number of secretory granules produced in PC12 cells by 78% while the suppression of CGA expression decreased the secretory granule production by 41% (FIG. 12, Table 5), demonstrating a significantly more potent effect of CGB. Suppression of chromogranin A or chromogranin B expression in PC12 cells was achieved by siRNA-CGA or siRNA-CGB treatment of PC12 cells (Huh et at. 2003). By the siRNA treatment the cognate chromogranin expression in the cells was reduced to 10-20% of the original level (FIG. 13)."

                                "In this regard, the present results that show the presence of chromogranin B and secretogranin II in the large dense-core vesicles in astrocytes of human brain tissues are in accord with the presence of secretory granules in human glial cells, and appear to underscore hitherto under-appreciated potential secretory activity of this organelle. It is therefore of great interest that the number of secretory granules in astrocytes of glioblastoma multiforme increased explosively (FIGS. 3 and 4, Table 3), as if to reveal a signature sign of the malignant brain tumor. The average number of secretory granules per cell image and the relative ratio of the secretory granule area over the total cell image area of the GBM astrocytes increased 30-fold and 42-fold, respectively, over the normal cells (Table 3 and FIG. 5). The stark contrast in the number of secretory granules between the normal and glioblastoma astrocytes has further been shown in the expression levels of chromogranin B and secretogranin II in the proteins that had been extracted from the normal and glioblastoma tissues (FIGS. 6 and 7), which showed 10.5-fold and 7.6-fold increases, respectively (FIGS. 6B and 7B). Considering that the brain tissues are composed of neurons and other glial cells such as oligodendrocytes and microglia, the 7.6-10.5-fold increase in the expression levels of CGB and SgII in the protein extracts still underscores the explosive increase in the number of granin-containing secretory granules in the astrocytes of glioblastoma multiforme.",
                                "Similar phenomena also occur in ganglioglioma, which is a tumor comprised of both neurons and glial cells, that there are also dramatic increases in the number of dense-core vesicles in the neoplastic neurons, particularly in the neuronal perikarya (Hirose et al. 1997; Sikorska et al. 2007). In addition, the expression of chromogranin A is also increased significantly in the neoplastic neurons of ganglioglioma (Hirose et al. 1997), thereby indicating the increase of secretory granules in these cells. It is further shown that the expression of neuropeptide Y, which is one of the integral components of secretory granules in both neurons and astrocytes, is abundant in the neoplastic neurons of ganglioglioma (Hirose et al. 1997). Given that chromogranins are granulogenic factors that induce formation of secretory granules in the cells they are expressed (Beuret et al. 2004; Huh et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2001), these results also indicate the increase in the number of secretory granules in the neoplastic neurons, thus strongly implicating the secretory granules to the neoplastic state of neurons.",
                                "The granin family proteins chromogranins A and B, and secretogranin II are the major proteins of secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells (Helle 2000; Montero-Hadjadje et al. 2008; Taupenot et al. 2003; Winkler and Fischer-Colbrie 1992; Huttner et al. 1991), and are high-capacity, low-affinity Ca2+ storage proteins (Yoo et al. 2001; Yoo and Albanesi 1991; Yoo et al. 2007). Due to the presence of the granin protein family, secretory granules contain the highest concentration of Ca2\u00b1, ranging 20-40 mM (Haigh et al. 1989; Hutton 1989), among all the subcellular organelles in secretory cells. In addition, secretory granules also contain large amounts of the IP3R/Ca2+ channels in their membranes (Huh et aZ 2005c; Yoo et al. 2001), which are directly bound to chromogranins A and B (Yoo et al. 2000; Yoo 2000). The bound chromogranins activate the IP3R/Ca2+ channels (Yoo and Jeon 2000), increasing the channel open probability and the mean open time of the channels 8-16-fold and 9-42-fold, respectively (Thrower et al. 2002; Thrower et al., 2003).",
                                "Accordingly, secretory granules play a major role in IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ control in secretory cells (Gerasimenko et al. 2006; Quesada et al. 2003; Quesada et al. 2001; Santodomingo et al. 2008; Srivastava et al. 1999; Xie et al. 2006; Gerasimenko et al, 1996; Nguyen et al. 1998; Yoo and Albanesi 1990): secretory granules have been shown to be responsible for >70% of IP3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in the cytoplasm of neuroendocrine cells (Huh et al. 2006; Huh et al. 2005b). Therefore, the presence of secretory granules in astrocytes not only indicates operation of secretory activity in these cells but also strongly points to the existence and operation of active IP3-dependent Ca2+ storage and control mechanisms. Nevertheless, research on the functional significance of the presence of secretory granules in glial cells still remains very limited. In the present study we have shown that normal glial astrocytes express a few secretory granules in both the cell body and the processes though it appeared that more secretory granules are localized in the processes than in the cell body. However, in the glioblastoma astrocytes secretory granules appeared distributed widely in both the cell body and the processes (FIGS. 3, A and B), implying their universal roles in the cytoplasm of the affected cells.",
                                "Given that gliotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, and peptides carry out essential roles in the cell-to-cell communication among the glial cells and neurons in the brain (Angulo et al. 2004; Fellin et al. 2006; Perea and Araque 2005; Volterra and Meldolesi 2005; Montana et al. 2006; Panatier et al. 2006; Haydon and Carmignoto 2006) and that the release of these gliotransmitters depends on the Ca2+ released from internal sources (Araque et al. 2000; Hua et al. 2004; Jeremic et al. 2001; Mothet et al. 2005; Martineau et al. 2008; Fellin et al. 2006; Santello and Volterra 2009; Ramamoorthy and Whim 2008), the extraordinary importance of intracellular Ca2+ stores in normal function of astrocytes becomes evident. That astrocytes lack the \u201cactive zones\u201d that exist in neuronal synapse of neurons and adjoin voltage-gated Ca2+ channels further underscores the importance of the intracellular Ca2+ source in the control of many Ca2+-dependent activities of astrocytes (Santello and Volterra 2009; Haydon and Carmignoto 2006).",
                                "Moreover, the Ca2+-dependent glutamate release in astrocytes is shown to be due to the IP3-dependent intracellular Ca+ releases (Araque et al. 2000; Hua et al. 2004; Jeremic et al. 2001). Therefore, considering that the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores that leads to regulated secretory pathway is primarily linked to IP3-dependent Ca2+ releases, it appears certain that the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores of astrocytes play key roles in the normal functions of these cells (Hua et al. 2004; Jeremic et al. 2001; Araque et al. 2000). In this respect, participation of secretory granules both as the carrier of secretory contents and as an intracellular Ca2+ store appears to highlight the importance of secretory granules in the normal physiology of astrocytes. Hence, the number of organelles that can serve as the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores will be critical in determining the Ca2+-dependent cellular activities of the cell in which they are localized, and for this reason the number of secretory granules present in the cell is likely to be a key determinant in the IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ control of the cell (reviewed in Yoo, 2009).",
                                "Therefore, given that secretory granules are the major intracellular organelle that stores and controls intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the cell in which they are localized (Gerasimenko et al. 1996; Haigh et al. 1989; Huh et al. 2006; Huh et al. 2005b; Hutton 1989; Yoo and Albanesi 1990; Quesada et al. 2003; Nguyen et al. 1998), the presence of unusually large number of secretory granules in GBM astrocytes strongly implies critical roles of Ca2+ in the pathogenesis of brain tumors involving astrocytes. In this respect, it is conceivable that excessive availability of Ca2+ in astrocytes might not bode well for the well-being of the cells, and the change in the number of Ca2+-controlling secretory granules might have proportionately changed the overall capacity of the cells to control intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In view of the importance of Ca2+ in the control of a variety of cellular functions, the change in the overall capacity of cells to control intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis could easily affect differentiation of cells, potentially leading to development and proliferation of cancerous cells.",
                                "Taken together, we suggest that the number of secretory granules expressed in glial astrocytes has a direct relationship with the pathogenic state of human brain tissues. The abnormally high capacity of the affected astrocytes to store and release Ca2+ may play a major role in the pathogenesis of the brain tumor, resulting in a close correlation between the pathogenic state of GBM astrocytes and the increased number of secretory granules in the cells."
