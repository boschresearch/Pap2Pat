                        "Myositis describes a cluster of inflammatory muscle diseases of unknown origin. Myositis is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that is associated with alterations in regulatory T cells (Y. Allenbach 2009 Am J Pathol 174:989). Both polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) cause muscle weakness; where DM is also associated with a skin rash. In addition, the related disease inclusion body myositis (IBM) develops later in life and has a worse prognosis. These diseases are chronic and persistent. There are no know cures for these PM and DM, but the symptoms are typically treated with corticosteroids. Most individuals with DM and PM respond to therapy, but those severe disease are refractory to treatment and suffer significant disability. There is no known effective therapy for IBM."

The immune system is a complex organization within the body that is designed normally to \u201cseek and destroy\u201d invaders of the body, including infectious agents. Subjects with autoimmune diseases frequently have unusual antibodies circulating in their blood that target their own body tissues. Autoimmune diseases also include diseases with immunoregulatory abnormalities, such as for example a wide variety of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, biliary cirrhosis, uveitis, multiple sclerosis, graft versus host (GVH) disease and other disorders such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, bullous pemphigoid, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and Graves ophthalmopathy. Although the underlying pathogenesis of each of these conditions can be quite different, they have in common the appearance of a variety of autoantibodies and self-reactive lymphocytes, and are therefore auto-immune disease which can be treated with the compositions and methods as disclosed herein. Autoimmune diseases are also referred to in the art as intractable diseases and allergic diseases. As used herein, \u201callergic disease\u201d refers to a disease associated with allergic reaction.

Cytokines are typically soluble proteins or peptides which are naturally produced by mammalian cells and which act in vivo as humoral regulators at micro- to picomolar concentrations. Cytokines can, either under normal or pathological conditions, modulate the functional activities of individual cells and tissues. A proinflammatory cytokine is a cytokine that is capable of causing any of the following physiological reactions associated with inflammation: vasodialation, hyperemia, increased permeability of vessels with associated edema, accumulation of granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes, or deposition of fibrin. In some cases, the pro-inflammatory cytokine can also cause apoptosis, such as in chronic heart failure, where TNF has been shown to stimulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Nonlimiting examples of pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1.alpha., IL-1.beta., IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, interferon-\u03b3 (INF\u03b3), HMG-1, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In preferred embodiments of the invention, the pro-inflammatory cytokine that is inhibited by cholinergic agonist treatment is TNF, an IL-1, IL-6 or IL-18, because these cytokines are produced by macrophages and mediate deleterious conditions for many important disorders, for example endotoxic shock, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bile disease, heart failure, and allograft rejection. In most preferred embodiments, the pro-inflammatory cytokine is TNF. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are to be distinguished from anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, which are not mediators of inflammation. In some embodiments, release of anti-inflammatory cytokines is not inhibited by cholinergic agonists.

Both full-length proteins and fragments thereof are encompassed by the definition. The terms also include co-translational (e.g., signal peptide cleavage of amino acids 1-20 of SEQ ID NO:1) and post-translational modifications of the polypeptide, such as, for example, disulfide-bond formation, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, proteolytic cleavage (e.g., cleavage by furins or metalloproteases and prohormone convertases (PCs)), and the like. Furthermore, for purposes of the present invention, a \u201cpolypeptide\u201d encompasses a protein that includes modifications, such as deletions, additions, and substitutions (generally conservative in nature as would be known to a person in the art), to the native sequence, as long as the protein maintains the desired activity. These modifications can be deliberate, as through site-directed mutagenesis, or can be accidental, such as through mutations of hosts that produce the proteins, or errors due to PCR amplification or other recombinant DNA methods. Polypeptides or proteins are composed of linearly arranged amino acids linked by peptide bonds, but in contrast to peptides, has a well-defined conformation. Proteins, as opposed to peptides, generally consist of chains of 50 or more amino acids. For the purposes of the present invention, the term \u201cpeptide\u201d as used herein typically refers to a sequence of amino acids of made up of a single chain of D- or L-amino acids or a mixture of D- and L-amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Generally, peptides contain at least two amino acid residues and are less than about 50 amino acids in length.",
                                "The incorporation of non-natural amino acids, including synthetic non-native amino acids, substituted amino acids, or one or more D-amino acids into the peptides (or other components of the composition, with exception for protease recognition sequences) is desirable in certain situations. D-amino acid-containing peptides exhibit increased stability in vitro or in vivo compared to L-amino acid-containing forms. Thus, the construction of peptides incorporating D-amino acids can be particularly useful when greater in vivo or intracellular stability is desired or required. More specifically, D-peptides are resistant to endogenous peptidases and proteases, thereby providing better oral trans-epithelial and transdermal delivery of linked drugs and conjugates, improved bioavailability of membrane-permanent complexes (see below for further discussion), and prolonged intravascular and interstitial lifetimes when such properties are desirable. The use of D-isomer peptides can also enhance transdermal and oral trans-epithelial delivery of linked drugs and other cargo molecules. Additionally, D-peptides cannot be processed efficiently for major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted presentation to T helper cells, and are therefore less likely to induce humoral immune responses in the whole organism. Peptide conjugates can therefore be constructed using, for example, D-isomer forms of cell penetrating peptide sequences, L-isomer forms of cleavage sites, and D-isomer forms of therapeutic peptides. In some embodiments, an Insl6.Fc are comprised of D- or L-amino acid residues, as use of naturally occurring L-amino acid residues has the advantage that any break-down products should be relatively non-toxic to the cell or organism.",

Thus, a retro-inverso analogue has reversed termini and reversed direction of peptide bonds while approximately maintaining the topology of the side chains as in the native peptide sequence. The retro-inverso peptide can contain L-amino acids or D-amino acids, or a mixture of L-amino acids and D-amino acids, up to all of the amino acids being the D-isomer. Partial retro-inverso peptide analogues are polypeptides in which only part of the sequence is reversed and replaced with enantiomeric amino acid residues. Since the retro-inverted portion of such an analogue has reversed amino and carboxyl termini, the amino acid residues flanking the retro-inverted portion are replaced by side-chain-analogous \u03b1-substituted geminal-diaminomethanes and malonates, respectively. Retro-inverso forms of cell penetrating peptides have been found to work as efficiently in translocating across a membrane as the natural forms.

For example, a conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has similar chemical properties. Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine. \u201cConservative amino acid substitutions\u201d result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and/or chemical properties, such as the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, or a threonine with a serine. Thus, a \u201cconservative substitution\u201d of a particular amino acid sequence refers to substitution of those amino acids that are not critical for polypeptide activity or substitution of amino acids with other amino acids having similar properties (e.g., acidic, basic, positively or negatively charged, polar or non-polar, etc.) such that the substitution of even critical amino acids does not reduce the activity of the peptide, (i.e. the ability of the peptide to reduce T-reg cells and/or decrease inflammatory cytokines as disclosed herein). Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example, the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W).

Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids.

PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments to show the percent sequence identity. It also plots a tree or dendogram showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng and Doolittle (J. Mol. Evol. 25:351-60 (1987), which is incorporated by reference herein). The method used is similar to the method described by Higgins and Sharp (Comput. Appl. Biosci. 5:151-53 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein). The program can align up to 300 sequences, each of a maximum length of 5,000 nucleotides or amino acids. The multiple alignment procedure begins with the pairwise alignment of the two most similar sequences, producing a cluster of two aligned sequences. This cluster is then aligned to the next most related sequence or cluster of aligned sequences. Two clusters of sequences are aligned by a simple extension of the pairwise alignment of two individual sequences. The final alignment is achieved by a series of progressive, pairwise alignments. The program is run by designating specific sequences and their amino acid or nucleotide coordinates for regions of sequence comparison and by designating the program parameters. For example, a reference sequence can be compared to other test sequences to determine the percent sequence identity relationship using the following parameters: default gap weight (3.00), default gap length weight (0.10), and weighted end gaps.",
                                "Another example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described by Altschul et al.

(See also Zhang et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 26:3986-90 (1998); Altschul et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 25:3389-402 (1997), which are incorporated by reference herein). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information internet web site. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al. (1990), supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Extension of the word hits in each direction is halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLAST program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-9 (1992), which is incorporated by reference herein) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands.",

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-77 (1993), which is incorporated by reference herein). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance.

For rheumatoid arthritis, efficacy and response may represent achieving the American College of Rheumatology ACR20 or ACR50 scores. In Crohn's disease, therapeutically effective doses may lower the Disease Activity Index (CDAI). This effect may be achieved by reducing circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and/or decreasing the numbers of inflammatory infiltrating cells such as monocytes and macrophages. To the extent that the drug or drug composition may affect effector cell (monocyte, macrophage, etc.) function or activity, it may block or interfere with the activity of these cells (e.g., reduce cytokine production) or it may kill existing cells by inducing their apoptosis.

In some embodiments, a gene sequence encoding a cognate Insl6 heterologous protein is at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or at least 95% identical to the homologous Insl6 transgene. As used herein, the terms \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cpercent identity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms, or by visual inspection. The phrase \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d in the context of two nucleic acids or polypeptides, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that have at least 60%, typically 80%, most typically 90-95% nucleotide or amino acid residue identity, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms, or by visual inspection. An indication that two polypeptide sequences are \u201csubstantially identical\u201d is that one polypeptide is immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against the second polypeptide.

Thus, in the prototypic example of insulin the signal peptide is proteolytically cleaved, the C-peptide is excised by prohormone convertases (PC1/PC3 and PC2), and the B-domain (amino acids 21-53 of SEQ ID NO:1) and A-domain (amino acids 173-198 of SEQ ID NO:1) are linked by inter- and intra-disulfide bonds to produce the biologically active form of Insl6. Prohormone protein convertases constitute a family of serine proteases structurally related to bacterial subtilisins and to yeast kexin. Several eukaryotic members of this family are currently known. Prohormone Convertases (PC's) cleave precursor polypeptides at specific basic residues, most often after selected paired basic residues, to generate bioactive peptide and proteins. Many members of the insulin family of proteins (e.g. Insulin, Igf-1) are substrates for PC's. In some embodiments, an Insl6 protein can be cleaved into fragment proteins which represent B-C-A (e.g., amino acids 21-198 of SEQ ID NO; 1), C-A (amino acids 55-198 of SEQ ID NO:1), and A peptides (amino acids 173-198 of SEQ ID NO:1) respectively, suggesting that analogous to insulin, Insl6 also undergoes post-translational processing.

The substitutions may be conservative or non-conservative. The differences between the natural Insl6 protein (e.g., wild-type protein) and a variant generally conserve desired properties, mitigate or eliminate undesired properties and add desired or new properties. For example, variants of an insl6 protein can have superior activity as compared to wild-type Insl6 protein and this functions as agonists. In some embodiments, where it is desirable to inhibit Insl6 activity, a variant with decreased activity or has the opposite function as compared to the wild type Insl6 protein can function as an antagonist, for example, but not limited to a dominant negative form of a metabolic regulator."

Tags and fusion partners can be designed to be cleavable, if so desired. Another modification specifically contemplated is attachment, e.g., covalent attachment, to a polymer. In one aspect, polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) can increase the in vivo half-life of proteins to which they are conjugated. Methods of PEGylation of polypeptide agents are well known to those skilled in the art, as are considerations of, for example, how large a PEG polymer to use.",
                                "In some embodiments, the Insl6 protein or functional fragment thereof is modified to achieve adequate circulating half-lives, which impact dosing, drug administration and efficacy. Many approaches have been undertaken with the aim to increase the half-life of biotherapeutics. Small proteins below 60 kD are cleared rapidly by the kidney and therefore do not reach their target. This means that high doses are needed to reach efficacy. The modifications to Insl6 proteins and fragments encompassed in the methods of the present invention to increase the half-life of proteins in circulation include: PEGylation; conjugation or genetic fusion with proteins, e.g., transferrin (WO06096515A2), albumin, growth hormone (US2003104578AA); conjugation with cellulose (Levy and Shoseyov, 2002); conjugation or fusion with Fc fragments; glycosylation and mutagenesis approaches (Carter, 2006), which are incorporated herein by reference.",
                                "In the case of PEGylation, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is conjugated to an Insl6 protein and fragment, which can be for example a plasma protein, antibody or antibody fragment. The first studies regarding the effect of PEGylation of antibodies were performed in the 1980s. The conjugation can be done either enzymatically or chemically and is well established in the art (Chapman, 2002; Veronese and Pasut, 2005). With PEGylation the total size can be increased, which reduces the chance of renal filtration. PEGylation further protects from proteolytic degradation and slows the clearance from the blood. Further, it has been reported that PEGylation can reduce immunogenicity and increase solubility. The improved pharmacokinetics by the addition of PEG is due to several different mechanisms: increase in size of the molecule, protection from proteolysis, reduced antigenicity, and the masking of specific sequences from cellular receptors. In the case of antibody fragments (Fab), a 20-fold increase in plasma half-life has been achieved by PEGylation (Chapman, 2002).",
                                "To date there are several approved PEGylated drugs, e.g., PEG-interferon alpha2b (PEG-INTRON) marketed in 2000 and alpha2a (Pegasys) marketed in 2002. A PEGylated antibody fragment against TNF alpha, called Cimzia or Certolizumab Pegol, was filed for FDA approval for the treatment of Crohn's disease in 2007 and has been approved on Apr. 22, 2008. A limitation of PEGylation is the difficulty in synthesizing long monodisperse species, especially when PEG chains over 1000 kD are needed. For many applications, polydisperse PEG with a chain length over 10000 kD is used, resulting in a population of conjugates having different length PEG chains, which need extensive analytics to ensure equivalent batches between productions. The different length of the PEG chains may result in different biological activities and therefore different pharmacokinetics. Another limitation of PEGylation is a decrease in affinity or activity as it has been observed with alpha-interferon Pegasys, which has only 7% of the antiviral activity of the native protein, but has improved pharmacokinetics due to the enhanced plasma half-life.",
                                "In some embodiments, an Insl6 protein or fragment thereof is conjugated with a long lived protein, e.g. albumin, which is 67 kD and has plasma half-life of 19 days in human (Dennis et al., 2002). Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma and is involved in plasma pH regulation, but also serves as a carrier of substances in plasma. In the case of CD4, increased plasma half-life has been achieved after fusing it to human serum albumin (Yeh et al., 1992). Other examples for fusion proteins are insulin, human growth hormone, transferrin and cytokines (Ali et al., 1999; Duttaroy et al., 2005; Melder et al., 2005; Osborn et al., 2002a; Osborn et al., 2002b; Sung et al., 2003) and see (US2003104578A1, WO06096515A2, and WO07047504A2, herein incorporated in entirety by reference).",
                                "The effect of glycosylation on plasma half-life and protein activity has also been extensively studied. In the case of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) the addition of new glycosylation sites decreased the plasma clearance, and improved the potency (Keyt et al., 1994). Glycoengineering has been successfully applied for a number of recombinant proteins and immunoglobulins (Elliott et al., 2003; Raju and Scallon, 2007; Sinclair and Elliott, 2005; Umana et al., 1999). Further, glycosylation influences the stability of immunoglobulins (Mimura et al., 2000; Raju and Scallon, 2006).",
                                "In some embodiments, Insl6 proteins or fragments thereof can be fused to the Fc fragment of an IgG (Ashkenazi and Chamow, 1997). The Fc fusion approach has been utilized, for example in the Trap Technology developed by Regeneron (e.g. IL1 trap and VEGF trap). The use of albumin to extend the half-life of peptides has been described in US2004001827A1. Positive effects of albumin have also been reported for Fab fragments and scFv-HSA fusion protein (Smith et al., 2001). It has been demonstrated that the prolonged serum half-life of albumin is due to a recycling process mediated by the FcRn (Anderson et al., 2006; Chaudhury et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2001).",

This is useful for treatment of autoimmune diseases of the muscle, for example, but not limited to myositis. A targeting ligand is a molecule, e.g., small molecule, protein or fragment thereof that specifically binds with high affinity to a target, e.g., a cell-surface marker on a pre-selected cell, such as a surface protein such as a receptor that is present to a greater degree on the pre-selected cell target than on any other body tissue. For example, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,814,478 and 6,413,740, the MuSK receptor is highly specific to muscle. Accordingly, the cognate ligand agrin, as well as MuSK binding portions thereof is an example of a targeting ligand useful to target the Insl6 agent to muscle. In some embodiments, the targeting ligand is fused an Insl6 protein (e.g., as a second fusion partner), for example fused to an Insl6 polypeptide or functional fragment, homologue, variant thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments, an Insl6 protein for use in the compositions and methods as disclosed herein can be fused to a Fc and/or optionally also to a targeting molecule. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid encoding a targeting ligand can be fused to a nucleotide encoding an Insl6 protein or fragment or homologue or variant thereof. Another example of a targeting ligand is a group of cadherin domains from a human cadherin. Accordingly, human cadherin domains from, for example, human muscle cadherin may be used in the targeting of agents of the present invention, for example but not limited to targeting an Insl6 polypeptide to target muscle cells. A targeting ligand component attached to an Insl6 polypeptide can include a naturally occurring or recombinant or engineered ligand, or a fragment thereof, capable of binding the pre-selected target cell.",
                                "In another embodiment of the invention, a targeting ligand can consists of at least three, four or five muscle cadherin (M-cadherin) domains, or derivatives or fragments thereof, capable of binding specifically to target cells that express homophilic cadherins. (Shimoyama et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273(16): 1001 1-10018; Shibata et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272(8):5236-5270). In some embodiments, the targeting ligand comprises at least three cadherin domains from the extracellular domain of human M-cadherin (or biologically active fragments or derivatives thereof that are capable of binding homophilic M-cadherin), fused to an agent of the present invention.",
                                "Further examples of targeting ligands also include, but are not limited to, antibodies and portions thereof that specifically bind a pre-selected cell surface protein with high affinity. By \u201chigh affinity\u201d is meant an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least molar, as determined by assay methods known in the art, for example, BiaCore analysis. In one embodiment, the targeting ligand may also comprise one or more immunoglobulin binding domains isolated from antibodies generated against a selected tissue-specific surface protein or target tissue-specific receptor. The term \u201cimmunoglobulin or antibody\u201d as used herein refers to a mammalian, including human, polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an antigen, which, in the case of the present invention, is a tissue-specific surface protein, a target tissue-specific receptor, or portion thereof. If the intended targeting fusion polypeptide will be used as a mammalian therapeutic, immunoglobulin binding regions should be derived from the corresponding mammalian immunoglobulins. If the targeting fusion polypeptide is intended for non-therapeutic use, such as for diagnostics and ELISAs, the immunoglobulin binding regions may be derived from either human or non-human mammals, such as mice. The human immunoglobulin genes or gene fragments include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant regions, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. Within each IgG class, there are different isotypes (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, etc.). Typically, the antigen-binding region of an antibody will be the most critical in determining specificity and affinity of binding.",
                                "An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit of human IgG, comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one light chain (about 25 kD) and one heavy chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100-110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms \u201cvariable light chain\u201d (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) refer to these light and heavy chains respectively. Antibodies exist as intact immunoglobulins, or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. For example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u20322, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CH by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u20322 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u20322 dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region. While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the terms immunoglobulin or antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies, or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single chain Fv)(scFv)) or those identified using phase display libraries (see, for example, McCafferty et al. (1990) Nature 348:552-554). In addition, the fusion polypeptides of the invention include the variable regions of the heavy (VH) or the light (VL) chains of immunoglobulins, as well as tissue-specific surface protein and target receptor-binding portions thereof. Methods for producing such variable regions are described in Reiter, et al. (1999) J. Mo!. Biol. 290:685-698.",

See, for example, Kohler & Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497; Harlow & Lane (1988) Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Lab., Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). The genes encoding the heavy and light chains of an antibody of interest can be cloned from a cell, e.g., the genes encoding a monoclonal antibody can be cloned from a hybridoma and used to produce a recombinant monoclonal antibody. Gene libraries encoding heavy and light chains of monoclonal antibodies can also be made from hybridoma or plasma cells. Random combinations of the heavy and light chain gene products generate a large pool of antibodies with different antigenic specificity. Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies or recombinant antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) can be adapted to produce antibodies used in the fusion polypeptides and methods of the instant invention. Also, transgenic mice, or other organisms such as other mammals, may be used to express human or humanized antibodies.

A secondary screen is preferably conducted to identify and select a desired monoclonal antibody for use in construction of the tissue-specific fusion polypeptides of the invention. Secondary screening may be conducted with any suitable method known to the art.

Without wishing to be bound by theory, regulatory T cells (Treg), are also referred to as suppressor T cells, are a specialized subpopulation of T cells which suppresses activation of the immune system and thereby maintains tolerance to self-antigens.

                                "Like other T cells, Treg cells also express the alpha-beta T-cell receptor for antigen (\u03b1\u03b2 TCR) and can only be activated if it binds to the peptide-class II MHC molecule for which it is specific and the cell also receives co-stimulation from B7 molecules (also known as CD80 and CD86) on the antigen-presenting cell. However, if activated, Treg cells begin to secrete large amounts of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and TGF-\u03b2. Treg cells are powerful immunosuppressants and may be one of the mechanisms by which Treg cells inhibit Th1 helper cells for cell-mediated immunity (including graft-versus-host disease) and inflammation; Th2 helper cells involved in antibody production; Th17 cells; natural killer (NK) cells; and the action of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Treg cells may also kill the various kinds of effector T cells by binding to them and secreting granzymes and perforins.",
                                "But perhaps the most important suppressor mechanism is the effect of Treg cells on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like dendritic cells. The CTLA-4 molecules on Treg cells bind tightly to the B7 molecules on the APCs, strip them off the APC, engulf them by endocytosis and destroy them. Having lost their B7 (CD80 and 86) molecules, the APCs can no longer present \u201csignal 2\u201d to activate effector T cells.",

Because IL-2 is secreted by effector T cells, this provides a negative-feedback mechanism: inflammatory T-cell activity (e.g., by Th1 cells) is restrained by the resulting expansion of Treg cells.",

                                "In one embodiment, the immune-related disease or disorder is organ transplantation rejection or graft-vs-host-disease (GVH). The method encompassed preventing as well as treating organ transplantation rejection in a subject who will be receiving or is an recipient of a donor organ. The method disclosed herein comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically-effective amount of an Insl6 protein or a fragment or fusion protein thereof as disclosed herein. Transplant rejection occurs when the immune system of the recipient of a transplant attacks the transplanted donor organ or tissue such as the heart, lungs, pancreas, liver, and kidneys. This is because a normal healthy human immune system can distinguish foreign tissues and attempts to destroy them, just as it attempts to destroy infective organisms such as bacteria and viruses. Acute organ rejection is generally mediated by T cell responses to proteins from the donor organ which differ from those found in the recipient. The development of T cell responses first occurs several days after a transplant if the patient is not taking immunosuppressant drugs. Acute organ rejection is caused by mismatched human leukocyte antigens (HLA) antigens that are present on all cells. HLA antigens are polymorphic therefore the chance of a perfect match is extremely rare. The reason that acute rejection occurs a week after transplantation is because the T-cells involved in rejection must be activated first by the foreign HLA, then differentiate and the antibodies in response to the allograft must be produced before rejection is initiated. These activated T-cells cause the graft cells to lyse or they produce cytokines that recruit other inflammatory cells, eventually causing necrosis of donor tissue. Endothelial cells in vascularized grafts such as kidneys are some of the earliest victims of acute rejection. Damage to the endothelial lining is an early predictor of irreversible acute graft failure. The new organ is then incapable of working at full efficiency, and symptoms of rejection become apparent to the transplant recipient. These symptoms of rejection are very similar to the symptoms of organ failure. Physicians skilled in the art can recognize and diagnose transplantation rejection. A biopsy of the transplanted organ can confirm that it is being rejected.",

As an illustrative example, the reference level for Insl6 expression can be calculated as the average level of the Insl6 gene and/or protein expression from a plurality of biological samples obtained from a plurality of subjects with similar demographics (i.e. age, gender, weight, ethnicity and the like). As another illustrative example only, a reference level for Insl6 expression can be from a plurality of subjects that do not have risk of, or have an autoimmune disease, such as myositis and/or an immune-related disorder. As another illustrative example only, a reference level for Insl6 expression can be from the same subject taken at an earlier timepoint. Typically, a reference level is normalized to \u201c0\u201d value, and a decrease, for example at least about a 30% decrease in the Insl6 expression level measured as disclosed herein relative to the reference level would indicate a subject would have, or at risk of developing an autoimmune disease, e.g., myositis. A reference Insl6 expression level can be from an individual not affected by a given pathology (i.e., not affected with an autoimmune disease, immune-related disorder or myositis), or, alternatively, from the same individual being tested, where the biological sample for the reference Insl6 expression was taken at an at least one earlier time point (i.e. t0, t1, t2 etc). A reference can also be a pooled sample, taken from a plurality of individuals not affected by the pathology in question (i.e., not affected with an autoimmune disease, immune-related disorder or myositis). Where appropriate, a reference can also be a fixed reference level of a Insl6 expression level, where a test Insl6 expression level below the fixed reference level (i.e. at least about 30% below the fixed reference level) a subject is identified as having, or at risk of developing an autoimmune disease, e.g., myositis (i.e. a positive myositis test result). It is preferred that a reference sample be from an individual or group of individuals of similar characteristics to the tested individual, e.g., that the reference be taken from individuals of similar age, gender, rave or ethnic background, etc. In some embodiments, other reference levels can also be used, for example a positive reference Insl6 expression level can be used as a positive control for a subject having a risk of developing or having an autoimmune disease, e.g., myositis. Typically, where a positive reference level is used, if the insl6 expression level in the test biological sample as disclosed herein is substantially the same or close in the value of the positive reference Insl6 expression level, it would indicate a positive test result for a subject having, or at risk of developing an autoimmune disease, e.g., myositis.",

In one embodiment, the detection of Insl6 protein or polypeptide is by immunoassay, e.g., using an antibody which specifically binds to the Insl6 protein. In one embodiment, the immuno assay is Western blot analysis or ELISA. The biological sample may be blood, serum, plasma, sputum, saliva, stool, tissue, urine, stool, lymph fluid, tears, or milk. The tissue may be from an organ, skeletal muscle, or neuronal tissue. The tissue may be cardiac tissue. The tissue may be obtained from a biopsy, e.g., a muscle biopsy.

The Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, Fc-fusion protein or derivative or functional fragment protein may be administered in any dose or dosing regimen.",
                                "With respect to the therapeutic methods of the invention, it is not intended that the administration of the Insl6 protein or polynucleotide encoding such an Insl6 protein or fusion protein or functional fragment thereof be limited to a particular mode of administration, dosage, or frequency of dosing; the present invention contemplates all modes of administration, including intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intravesicular, intraarticular, intralesional, subcutaneous, or any other route sufficient to provide a dose adequate to treat an autoimmune disease or immune-related disorder as disclosed herein. An effective amount, e.g., a therapeutically effective dose of an insl6 agent may be administered to the patient in a single dose or in multiple doses. When multiple doses are administered, the doses may be separated from one another by, for example, one hour, three hours, six hours, eight hours, one day, two days, one week, two weeks, or one month. For example, a composition comprising an insl6 agent can be administered for, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, or more weeks. It is to be understood that, for any particular subject, specific dosage regimes should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. For example, the dosage of the therapeutic can be increased if the lower dose does not provide sufficient therapeutic activity.",
                                "While the attending physician ultimately will decide the appropriate amount and dosage regimen, an effective amounts of an Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, insl6-Fc-fusion protein or derivative or functional fragment thereof can provided at a dose of 0.0001, 0.01, 0.01 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test bioassays or systems.",
                                "Dosages for a particular patient or subject can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using conventional considerations, (e.g. by means of an appropriate, conventional pharmacological protocol). A physician may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. The dose administered to a patient is sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, or, e.g., to reduce symptoms, or other appropriate activity, depending on the application. The dose is determined by the efficacy of the particular formulation, and the activity, stability or serum half-life of the Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, Insl6-Fc-fusion protein or functional derivatives or functional fragments thereof as disclosed herein, and the condition of the patient, the autoimmune disease to be treated, as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular vector, formulation, or the like in a particular subject. Therapeutic compositions comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, Insl6-Fc-fusion protein or functional derivatives or functional fragments thereof are optionally tested in one or more appropriate in vitro and/or in vivo animal models of disease, such a CIM mouse model as disclosed herein, or other models of autoimmune disease commonly known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, to confirm efficacy, tissue metabolism, and to estimate dosages, according to methods well known in the art. In particular, dosages can be initially determined by activity, stability or other suitable measures of treatment vs. non-treatment (e.g., comparison of treated vs. untreated cells or animal models), in a relevant assay. Formulations are administered at a rate determined by the LD50 of the relevant formulation, and/or observation of any side-effects of an Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, Insl6-Fc-fusion protein or functional derivatives or functional fragments thereof at various concentrations, e.g., as applied to the mass and overall health of the patient. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.",
                                "In determining the effective amount of Insl6 agent, e.g., insl6 protein, Insl6-Fc-fusion protein or functional derivatives or functional fragments thereof to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease, the physician evaluates circulating plasma levels, formulation toxicities, and progression of the disease. The selected dosage level will also depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.",
                                "In some embodiments, Insl6 agents as disclosed herein can be administered at a dose in accordance with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient, the site and method of administration, scheduling of administration, patient age, sex, body weight and other factors known to medical practitioners.",
                                "Dosage regimens of a composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein can be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g. a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus can be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.",
                                "Furthermore, actual dosage levels of Insl6 agents in a pharmaceutical composition can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the subject. A pharmaceutical composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein can be a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d and/or a \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d. In general, a suitable daily dose of a composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein will be that amount of the Insl6 agent which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect, such as a reduction of a symptom of an autoimmune disease, for example, a reduction of immune cells which express CD4 and/or CD8 as disclosed herein, or a reduction of at least one pro-inflammatory cytokine in the subject. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above.",
                                "If desired, the effective daily dose of a composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof can be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms.",
                                "It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the autoimmune disease or immune-related disorder or dysfunction to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.",
                                "The efficacy and toxicity of the compound can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., ED50 (the dose is effective in 50% of the population) and LD50 (the dose is lethal to 50% of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, and it can be expressed as the ratio, LD50/ED50. Pharmaceutical compositions which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. An appropriate experimental model which can be used includes determining a decrease in inflammatory cytokines and/or reduction in Treg cells in an animal model of autoimmune disease, such as a CIM mouse as disclosed herein in the Examples.",
                                "For example, a therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in animal models, usually mice, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. The animal model is also used to achieve a desirable concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in other subjects. Generally, the therapeutically effective amount is dependent of the desired therapeutic effect. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of an insl6 agent can be assessed in a mouse model of c protein-induced (poly)myositis (CIM) as disclosed herein and in the Examples, where a measure of the effective dose can be reduced muscle inflammation, e.g., reduced expression of any one or a combination of TNF\u03b1, MCP-1, CD11b, CD4 and/or CD8 in mice administered the Insl6 agent as compared to mice not administered the Insl6 agent.",
                                "A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. It is also noted that humans are treated generally longer than the mice or other experimental animals exemplified herein, which treatment has a length proportional to the length of the disease process and drug effectiveness. The doses may be single doses or multiple doses over a period of several days, but single doses are preferred.",
                                "In some embodiments, the Insl6 agents (e.g., proteins or nucleic acids encoding Insl6 protein and fragments thereof) can be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.",
                                "After formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein can be administered to a subject. A pharmaceutical a composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof can be administered to a subject using any suitable means. In general, suitable means of administration include, but are not limited to, topical, oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular), rectal, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, ocular, or nasal routes.",
                                "In a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical composition comprising an Insl6 polypeptide locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., by injection, by means of a catheter, or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, fibers, or commercial skin substitutes. In some embodiments, Insl6 agents as disclosed herein are applied to the muscle using topical creams, patches, intramuscular injections and the like.",
                                "In some embodiments, an insl6 agent can be administered to a subject orally (e.g., in capsules, suspensions or tablets) or by parenteral administration. Conventional methods for oral administration include administering an Insl6 agent as a tablets, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, capsules, powders, syrups and the like are usable. Known techniques that deliver an insl6 agent orally or intravenously and retain the biological activity are preferred. Parenteral administration can include, for example, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrathecal, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal administration. The insl6 agent can also be administered orally, transdermally, topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops) or rectally. Administration can be local or systemic as indicated. Agents, e.g., nucleic acid agents which encode an insl6 protein or variant or functional fragment thereof can also be delivered using a vector, e.g., a viral vector by methods which are well known to those skilled in the art.",
                                "When administering a composition comprising an Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein parenterally, it will generally be formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (e.g., solution, suspension, emulsion). The pharmaceutical formulations suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.",
                                "The term \u201cDosage unit\u201d form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the Insl6 agent, e.g., Insl6 protein versus a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, mRNA, MOD-RNA) encoding an Insl6 protein or functional fragment or variant thereof as disclosed herein and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding an Insl6 agent an active agent for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.",

Non-aqueous vehicles such a cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, or peanut oil and esters, such as isopropyl myristate, may also be used as solvent systems for compound compositions. Additionally, various additives which enhance the stability, sterility, and isotonicity of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, e.g., parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol and sorbic acid. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some embodiments, insl6 prodrugs can be activated by hydrolysis in blood, e.g., via cleavage of a precursor Insl6 protein into an active Insl6 protein, similar to how insulin is activated from its proprotein into an active insulin protein. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higachi and V. Stella, \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in: Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As used herein, a prodrug is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. The prodrug may be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of an insl6 agent, to mask side effects or toxicity, or to alter other characteristics or properties of the Insl6 agent. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism or post-translational protein processing of insl6 in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is identified, those of skill in the pharmaceutical art generally can design insl6 agent prodrugs which can be activated in vivo to increase levels of Insl6 protein in the subject (see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, N.Y., pages 388-392). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrugs are described, for example, in \u201cDesign of Prodrugs,\u201d ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Suitable examples of prodrugs include methyl, ethyl and glycerol esters of the corresponding acid.",

Muscle-specific expression can be achieved, for example, using the skeletal muscle MKC promoter (as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application WO2007/100722, which is incorporated herein by reference), or other muscle-specific promoters, such as \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2 (which is specific for skeletal muscle (Shani et al., Nature, 314; 283-86, 1985), gonadotrophic releasing hormone gene control region which is active in the hypothalamus (Mason et al, Science, 234; 1372-78, 1986), and smooth muscle promoter SM22a, which are all commonly known in the art.",

                                "In a specific embodiment, viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an insl6 nucleic acid agent, e.g., DNA, MOD-RNA or RNAa, encoding an insl6 protein or a functional derivative or functional variant or functional fragment thereof as disclosed herein (including fusion proteins with fragments or derivatives or variants of Insl6 thereof as described herein) are used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., Meth. Enzymol. 217:581-599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding a human Insl6 fusion polypeptide are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al., Biotherapy 6:291-302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., J. Clin. Invest. 93:644-651 (1994); Kiem et al., Blood 83:1467-1473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, Human Gene Therapy 4:129-141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3:110-114 (1993).",
                                "The production of a recombinant retroviral vector carrying a gene of interest is typically achieved in two stages. First, sequence encoding an insl6 protein or a functional derivative or functional variant or functional fragment thereof, alone or fused to \u2212Fc can be inserted into a retroviral vector which contains the sequences necessary for the efficient expression of the metabolic regulators (including promoter and/or enhancer elements which can be provided by the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) or by an internal promoter/enhancer and relevant splicing signals), sequences required for the efficient packaging of the viral RNA into infectious virions (e.g., a packaging signal (Psi), a tRNA primer binding site (\u2212PBS), a 3\u2032 regulatory sequence required for reverse transcription (+PBS)), and a viral LTRs). The LTRs contain sequences required for the association of viral genomic RNA, reverse transcriptase and integrase functions, and sequences involved in directing the expression of the genomic RNA to be packaged in viral particles.",
                                "Following the construction of the recombinant retroviral vector, the vector DNA is introduced into a packaging cell line. Packaging cell lines provide viral proteins required in trans for the packaging of viral genomic RNA into viral particles having the desired host range (e.g., the viral-encoded core (gag), polymerase (pol) and envelope (env) proteins). The host range is controlled, in part, by the type of envelope gene product expressed on the surface of the viral particle. Packaging cell lines can express ecotrophic, amphotropic or xenotropic envelope gene products. Alternatively, the packaging cell line can lack sequences encoding a viral envelope (env) protein. In this case, the packaging cell line can package the viral genome into particles which lack a membrane-associated protein (e.g., an env protein). To produce viral particles containing a membrane-associated protein which permits entry of the virus into a cell, the packaging cell line containing the retroviral sequences can be transfected with sequences encoding a membrane-associated protein (e.g., the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)). The transfected packaging cell can then produce viral particles which contain the membrane-associated protein expressed by the transfected packaging cell line; these viral particles which contain viral genomic RNA derived from one virus encapsidated by the envelope proteins of another virus are said to be pseudotyped virus particles.",
                                "Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3:499-503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., Human Gene Therapy 5:3-10 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Another preferred viral vector is a pox virus such as a vaccinia virus, for example an attenuated vaccinia such as Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) or NYVAC, an avipox such as fowl pox or canary pox. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., Science 252:431-434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., Cell 68:143-155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., J. Clin. Invest. 91:225-234 (1993); PCT Publication WO94/12649; and Wang, et al., Gene Therapy 2:775-783 (1995).

Usually, the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.",

Insl6 overexpressing mice performed significantly better than wild-type mice in both rotarod and treadmill assessments of muscle performance (FIG. 2).",
                                "Inflammation is reduced in the muscle-specific Insl6-overexpressing mice in the CIM model (FIG. 3). Wild-type (WT) and Insl6 transgenic (TG) mice were immunized as described in the CIM protocol (FIG. 1). At 14 days post-immunization, mice were sacrificed and total RNA was isolated from tibialis anterior muscle to measure relative transcript expression by qRT-PCR. Transcripts encoding inflammatory proteins and markers, including CD4, CD8, CD11b, TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1, were significantly reduced in the mice that overexpress Insl6 in muscle (FIG. 3).",
                                "A plasmid expressing an Fc-Insl6 fusion protein was constructed for hydrodynamic tail vein delivery to mice (FIG. 4). This plasmid encodes the IgG Fc fragment fused to the N-terminus of murine Insl6. The Fc fragment is commonly fused with proteins to increase their serum half-life (e.g. I. Shiojima et al. 2005 J Clin Invest. 115:2108). The hydrodynamic delivery was performed according to the published procedure (M. G. Sebstyen et al. 2006 J. Gene Med 8:852). For each mouse, 16 micrograms of plasmid, in 80 microliters of volume per gram of body weight, was delivered within 8 seconds via tail vein injection. Control experiments were conducted with the empty plasmid vector (no transgene). ELISA analysis of the serum indicated circulating levels of Fc-containing protein at 7 days after hydrodynamic delivery in mice that had received the plasmid encoding the Fc-Insl6 encoding plasmid.",
                                "To corroborate findings with the Insl6 transgenic mouse, hydrodynamic delivery of the plasmid expressing the Fc-Insl6 fusion was performed after the mice were immunized to develop myositis. Mice receiving the Fc-Insl6 expressing plasmid performed significantly better in the rotarod and treadmill tests (FIG. 5). Insl6 transgenic (TG) mice were also demonstrated to have more Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in cardiotoxin-injured muscles as determined by immunohistochemistry. Cardiotoxin was injected into tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of Insl6 TG male mice and their wild-type littermates. Immunostaning with anti-Foxp3 of the TA muscle 7 days after cardiotoxin injection indicated more Treg cells (data not shown).",
                                "Insl6 transcript levels were determined in a cohort of myositis patients and control subject that were matched for age and gender. Patients with polymyositis (PM) or dermatomyositis (DM) displayed lower level of the Insl6 transcript (FIG. 6)."
