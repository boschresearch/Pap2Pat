    "title": "The injury-induced myokine insulin-like 6 is protective in experimental autoimmune myositis",
    "date": "2014-08-04",
    "abstract": "The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies represent a group of autoimmune diseases that are characterized by lymphocyte infiltration of muscle and muscle weakness. Insulin-like 6 (Insl6) is a poorly characterized member of the insulin-like/relaxin family of secreted proteins, whose expression is upregulated upon acute muscle injury.In this study, we employed Insl6 gain or loss of function mice to investigate the role of Insl6 in a T cell-mediated model of experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM). EAM models in rodents have involved immunization with human myosin-binding protein C with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) emulsions and pertussis toxin.Insl6-deficiency in mice led to a worsened myositis phenotype including increased infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells and the elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines. Insl6-deficient mice show significant motor function impairment when tested with treadmill or Rotarod devices. Conversely, muscle-specific overexpression of Insl6 protected against the development of myositis as indicated by reduced lymphocyte infiltration in muscle, diminished inflammatory cytokine expression and improved motor function. The improvement in myositis by Insl6 could also be demonstrated by acute hydrodynamic delivery of a plasmid encoding murine Insl6. In cultured cells, Insl6 inhibits Jurkat cell proliferation and activation in response to phytohemagglutinin/phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Insl6 transcript expression in muscle was reduced in a cohort of dermatomyositis and polymyositis patients.These data suggest that Insl6 may have utility for the treatment of myositis, a condition for which few treatment options exist.",

                "Idiopathic inflammatory myositis is a category of autoimmune muscle disorders that include polymyositis, dermatomyositis and inclusion body myositis. Features common to all of the subtypes include muscle weakness, histological evidence of muscle inflammation and elevated levels of creatine kinase. However, each subset also has unique clinical, immunopathologic and histologic criteria [1]. Dermatomyositis is a vascular endothelial lesion associated with perimysial inflammation and perifascicular muscle fiber atrophy, whereas polymyositis is associated with injury to muscle fibers by aggressive immune cells which predominantly infiltrate the endomysium [2]. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells are prominently present in muscle of the different myositis subgroups. In dermatomyositis, large numbers of helper T cells (CD4 T cells) are found within the perimysial, often perivascular areas. In polymyositis, activated cytotoxic T cells (CD8 T cells) surround and invade non-necrotic muscle fibers, while helper T cells are found at more distant parts of the infiltrates [3]. These inflammatory muscle diseases are rare and there are few effective treatment strategies for these patients [4].",
                "Immune cells regulate skeletal muscle regeneration after myofiber damage [5,6]. Muscle damage stimulates massive infiltration of immune cells into the injury site, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. These cells function in the phagocytosis of necrotic muscle fibers, express pro-inflammatory cytokines and participate in satellite cell activation [7]. We have previously demonstrated that Insl6 has muscle regenerative and anti-inflammatory activities in a cardiotoxin-induced model of severe muscle injury when expressed using an engineered adenovirus vector [8]. We therefore sought to extend these studies and explore the utility of Insl6 in the setting of inflammatory muscle injury using a rodent model of myositis.",
                "In the current study, we employed Insl6 gain or loss of function mice to investigate the role of Insl6 in a T cell-mediated model of experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM). EAM models in rodents have involved immunization with native myosin-binding protein C with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) emulsions and pertussis toxin (PT) [9,10]. In murine EAM, the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells is observed, similar to what is seen in human PM and DM [11]. Of interest, depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells suppresses the myositis phenotype in this model [11]. Using this model, we find that Insl6-deficiency led to greater muscle damage, increased inflammation and reduced motor function in the murine model of EAM. Conversely, Insl6 overexpression diminished inflammation and improved motor function."

To further investigate the role of Insl6 in muscle regeneration, we analyzed the response of Insl6-deficient mice (Insl6-KO) in this model. Although no muscle abnormalities were observed in the unchallenged Insl6-KO mice and muscle mass and myofiber cross-sectional area were unaffected (data not shown), following CTX delivery to the TA muscle these mice displayed an impaired regenerative response. More inflammatory cell infiltrate was observed in H&E-stained histological sections, compared to littermate wild-type mice (Figure\u00a01a). Quantifying myofiber area in these sections revealed that the regenerative response was delayed in the Insl6-KO mice at both seven and fourteen days following CTX delivery. Since muscle injury with CTX elicits a T cell response [7], sections were also stained for CD4 and CD8 cells. CTX-treated Insl6-KO mice had increased CD4 and CD8 cells in injured muscle compared to CTX-treated wild-type littermates (Figure\u00a01b). No CD4 or CD8 cells were observed in non-injured muscles."

                        "The consequences of Insl6-deficiency were evaluated in a murine model of myositis, where a recombinant fragment of human fast-type skeletal myosin-binding C protein was used as antigen in wild-type C57BL/6 female mice [11]. In this model of C protein-induced myositis (CIM), Insl6 protein levels were upregulated at 14\u00a0days after immunization. Western blot analysis of gastrocnemius muscle (GA) revealed an approximate ten-fold upregulation of Insl6 compared with expression in muscle from untreated control mice (Figure\u00a02a). CIM also led to an approximate three-fold increase in the expression of the Insl6 transcript (Figure\u00a02b). No Insl6 expression was detected in muscle from the Insl6-KO mice. The Insl6-KO mice have a Neo cassette inserted, expressed from the mPGK1 promoter, to replace Insl6 exon1 [12]. This Neo cassette could be detected in Insl6-KO mice but not in wild-type mice (Figure\u00a02b).",
                        "Muscle motor function was evaluated by the performance on Rotarod and treadmill devices in the different experimental groups. These physiological parameters did not differ between wild-type and Insl6-KO mice at baseline (Figure\u00a03a). CIM conditions led to a running distance decline of 70 to 80% in Insl6-KO mice, whereas wild-type mice had only a 30 to 40% reduction. The CIM-induced decline in Rotarod performance was highly notable in the Insl6-KO versus wild-type mice (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Under these test conditions, Insl6-deficiency led to an approximately 90% decline in performance but wild-type mice showed an approximately 50% decline (Figure\u00a03a).",
                        "Infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells in muscle is a hallmark of the CIM model [11]. Thus, CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration was assessed in multiple lower limb muscles, including TA, GA, and quadriceps. No appreciable T cell infiltration was observed in wild-type or Insl6-KO mice at baseline (data not shown). The infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells was observed in most of the limb muscles of the CIM mice. In Figure\u00a03b, a representative image of TA muscle section stained with CD4/CD8 and laminin is shown. Quantitative analyses revealed more CD4 and CD8 T cells present in the Insl6-KO muscle, compared with wild-type controls. T cell infiltration was observed in the perimysial and perivascular areas. No obvious endomysial CD8 T cell infiltration was observed in any experimental condition, in contrast with a prior report [11]. Analysis of histological sections of muscle with the macrophage marker F4/80 showed a trend toward greater infiltration of macrophages in the Insl6-KO mice under CIM conditions, but this difference was not statistically significant (Additional file 2: Figure S3).Using RNA isolated from lower limb muscles, qRT-PCR analyses were performed to measure the expression of inflammatory marker genes. Consistent with the histological analyses in Figure\u00a03b, CD4 and CD8 transcript levels were elevated in Insl6-KO mice relative to wild-type in the CIM model (Figure\u00a03c). Transcript levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were also significantly increased in Insl6-KO versus wild-type mice in the CIM condition (Figure\u00a03d). At baseline, transcript levels of CD8, CD4, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 are very low in both Insl6-KO and wild-type mice, and there was no difference between groups."

Hydrodynamic gene delivery involves the rapid injection of a relatively large volume of plasmid DNA solution via the tail vein, leading to the transduction of liver and the production and secretion of plasmid-encoded proteins [13]. This method of acute gene delivery avoids the confounding aspects of viral vectors, in particular the activation of a T cell inflammatory response [17]. Using hydrodynamic delivery, a plasmid expressing Insl6 or an empty vector was delivered to Insl6-KO mice under non-CIM conditions at the time of immunization with the C-protein fragment. This procedure led to detectable levels of the Fc-Insl6 fusion protein in the serum, with levels as high as 1,800\u00a0ng/ml as measured by human Fc ELISA (not shown). Delivery of the Insl6-expressing plasmid had no effect on baseline Rotarod performance in wild-type mice (Figure\u00a05a). However, plasmid-mediated Insl6 led to marked improvements in Rotarod performance in the CIM model. Hydrodynamic delivery of Insl6 plasmid to CIM mice also led to statistically significant reductions in transcript levels of inflammatory marker proteins in TA muscle, including CD4, CD8, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, relative to muscle from animals that received the control vector (Figure\u00a05b, c)."

Since Insl6 is a secreted protein [8,20], we also tested the ability of culture medium containing Insl6 to inhibit Jurkat cell proliferation. Myogenic C2C12 cells were transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing murine Insl6 [8] or a control vector expressing \u03b2-gal. Cell culture medium was collected 48\u00a0hours post-transduction. mRNA was extracted from C2C12 cell lysates and Insl6 transcript was measured by quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the Insl6 overexpression (data not shown).

The cases were identified using published criteria [21]. None of the polymyositis/dermatomyositis patients were receiving steroid therapy at the time of biopsy. Disease severity was similar in this series of inflammatory myositis cases as judged by reductions in quantified mean myofiber diameter and histopathology grading [22] compared to previous case series [23,24]. Control cases underwent biopsy for various symptoms but no individuals had high creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values and no abnormalities were found after extensive microscopic review including a special histochemistry battery. Cases of inclusion body myositis were excluded from this set. The control set had a mean age of 58.8\u2009\u00b1\u200940 (36 to 85) years at the time of biopsy, 6 male and 8 female. The polymyositis/dermatomyositis set had a mean age of 53.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2 (22 to 78) years, 4 male and 9 female. Differences in age, sex and time in storage were not significantly different between control and myositis groups (Table\u00a01 and data not shown). Whereas transcript levels of Insl6 in control muscle were fairly uniform, myositis patients displayed an overall reduction in Insl6 transcript levels (P\u2009=\u20090.0378) and the expression of Insl6 was more heterogeneous with some patients exhibiting very low levels of this factor (Figure\u00a07a). Furthermore, histological sections from the patients were scored for the degree of myofiber atrophy and then plotted against Insl6 transcript levels that were above and below the mean. A statistically significant difference in Insl6 levels relative to clinical severity was observed (Figure\u00a07b)."

                "Insl6 is upregulated in injured muscle and it has been reported that it has muscle-regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties when overexpressed in the cardiotoxin model of muscle injury [8]. In this report, we demonstrate that mice lacking Insl6 display enhanced muscle inflammation and impaired regeneration following exposure to cardiotoxin. The present study also reports that Insl6 is protective in a murine model resembling human inflammatory myopathy using genetically modified mice either lacking or overexpressing Insl6. Furthermore, it is shown that overexpression of an Fc-Insl6 hybrid protein following hydrodynamic plasmid delivery improves overall muscle pathology in this model based upon functional, histological and biochemical evidence. These data support a therapeutic role for Insl6 in inflammatory myopathies where there is a high unmet need for new therapies.",
                "Experimental myositis has been induced previously in different species with a variety of agents. Here, we employed a model of autoimmune myositis in C57BL/6 mice by administering a single immunization of recombinant human skeletal C-protein fragment emulsified in Freund\u2019s adjuvant with heat-inactivated M. butyricum[11]. The resulting histopathologic abnormalities resembled some features of human polymyositis including CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration. In our analyses, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were observed in perivascular and perimysial areas, but no pronounced myofiber invasion was observed. While there was no apparent myofiber necrosis, we observed pronounced muscle motor dysfunction in both Rotarod and treadmill within two weeks of immunization. Deficiency of Insl6 led to an increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration, increased inflammatory cytokine expression and greater motor function impairment in the myositis model. Conversely, overexpression of Insl6, either by chronic overexpression in muscle or acute systemic overexpression, minimized T cell infiltration and cytokine expression in muscle and improved performance in the Rotarod and treadmill tests.",
                "It is widely recognized that subsets of T cells play important roles in the development of the myositis phenotype [3,25-27]. In our study, Insl6 was shown to inhibit T cell activation and IL-2 cytokine secretion. These effects could be shown either by directly overexpressing Insl6 within Jurkat T cells or by treating these cells with Insl6-conditioned media. In addition, Insl6 negatively regulated the production of inflammatory cytokines in muscle. Previously, we reported that Insl6 can act on myoblasts to promote a regenerative response in muscle [8]. Thus, it appears that Insl6 can act both on inflammatory and muscle cells to control the response to injury in muscle.",
                "Interestingly, Insl6 mRNA transcript levels are down-regulated in human myositis biopsy samples, whereas this factor is upregulated in the murine models of myositis and cardiotoxin injury. We speculate that Insl6 is an endogenous immunosuppressant or immunosurveillance factor. In animal injury models that are relatively short-term, the release of Insl6 may function as a self-protective mechanism that minimizes immune-mediated tissue destruction. However, in chronic human disease, the reduction of Insl6 by an as-yet-unidentified mechanism may contribute to the development of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies or other autoimmune diseases. Consistent with this notion, low levels of Insl6 correlated with disease severity. Thus, reestablishing the normal upregulation of Insl6 in muscle of myositis patients may have therapeutic utility.",
                "Comparative genomic analysis shows that Insl6 is a member of the insulin-like/relaxin family of proteins that have diverse roles in reparative and reproductive processes [28]. Whereas insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and insulin activate tyrosine kinase receptors, most insulin-like family proteins signal through G-protein-coupled-receptors to control cAMP-mediated signaling events [29]. However, the receptor for Insl6 has yet to be identified, and nothing is known about the downstream signaling molecules that respond to this ligand. Related family members, including Insl1 (which is also referred to as relaxin), have been shown to have both muscle- and cardiovascular-protective actions. It has previously been shown that relaxin will promote muscle repair in a laceration model through its ability to diminish fibrosis and promote satellite cell mobilization in both young and aged mice [30,31]. Human recombinant relaxin-2 protein (RLX030) is in clinical development for the treatment of acute heart failure [32]. In the RELAX-AHF phase III clinical trial, patients treated with relaxin-2 for 48\u00a0hours experienced improved heart failure symptoms and a 37% reduction in mortality, leading to a breakthrough therapy designation by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA). Finally, Insl3 has been shown to have cardiac regenerative properties in a zebrafish model [33]. Thus the insulin-like/relaxin family members represent a potentially interesting source of factors for the treatment of heart failure and muscle weakness, two processes that are inter-related in the pathological condition that is referred to as cardiac cachexia.",
                "In contrast to the well-described anabolic functions of the IGF isoforms [34,35], Insl6 overexpression neither stimulates myogenesis in normal muscle nor induces C2C12 cell hypertrophy in culture [8]. Insl6 promotes muscle regeneration only after injury, and this effect is associated with an increase in satellite cell activation and the diminution of inflammatory marker expression [8]. Consistent with these observations, the Insl6-deficient mice generated by Burnicka-Turek and colleagues [12] have morphologically and functionally normal muscle at baseline. However, after muscle stress or damage, significantly impaired regeneration and deteriorated pathology were observed in the Insl6-deficient animals.",
                "Many of the immunopathogenic processes behind myositis remain poorly understood. However, it is generally accepted that cytokines and chemokines are essential regulators of leukocyte activation and migration [3,11,36]. In animal EAM models, it has been reported that IL-6 or IL-1 blockade diminishes the severity of myositis [37]. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been identified as a pivotal cell population in the control of autoimmunity [38]. Treg-deficiency causes over-proliferation of lymphocytes and multi-organ autoimmunity in both humans and mice. Treg abundance is significantly reduced in skin lesions and peripheral blood of patients with dermatomyositis [39]. In Treg-depleted mice, a more severe phenotype was observed in the experimental autoimmune myositis model, whereas the injection of Tregs at the time of immunization significantly improved the disease [25].",
                "To date, evidence for the utility of Insl6 as a potential therapy for inflammatory myositis has been limited to experimental settings using genetic models and plasmid-driven overexpression in vivo. Future studies will involve the development of a well-characterized, biologically-active recombinant form of Insl6 to assess the pharmacological activity of this protein and further elucidate its mechanism of action."
