    "date": "2020-12-01",
    "abstract": "Efficient and cost-effective soft magnetic materials (SMMs) are essential for accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles and the sustainable growth of renewable electricity. While amorphous and nanocrystalline SMMs offer remarkably low magnetic losses, their poor mechanical properties, limited availability in size and shape (particularly ribbon widths), and high cost prevent them from widespread industrial application. Here, we show that ductile Fe-6.5%Si 2-D flakes could be used as building blocks for making high performance bulk SMMs. This approach bypasses the brittleness problem and creates a new morphology and a new fabrication method for the SMMs with improved energy efficiency and lower processing cost. Ductile Fe-6.5%Si flakes are mass-produced by melt spinning and are then consolidated to bulk SMMs with a brick-wall type of structure. The novel process introduces anisotropic electrical and magnetic properties and enables near net shape processing. Resulting Fe-6.5%Si thin sheets display low iron loss (W10/400\u00a0=\u00a06.1\u00a0W/kg) and high permeability (\u00b5r\u00a0=\u00a028,000), which are comparable to the current state of the art high silicon steel. CaF2 coating reduces the iron losses for thick Fe-6.5%Si parts. Polymer coated Fe-6.5%Si flake cores show potential for high power inductors with greater permeability and lower losses than traditional powder cores.",

                "Intensive competition for lower capital and ownership cost demands electric machines and power electronics with higher power density and efficiency. A common approach to increased power density is to increase excitation frequency. However, operation at a higher frequency has adverse impacts on a system's efficiency due to increasing magnetic losses, which include hysteresis loss (W h ) and eddy current loss (W e ). W h occurs due to the lag between magnetization and applied field originated from domain wall motion and domain rotation processes. To minimize hysteresis loss, SMMs should have high permeability so that a high magnetic flux can be achieved with less current and low coercivity so that less magnetic energy is wasted on demagnetizing the magnet. It should also have high saturation magnetization (M s ) for realizing higher energy density. Coercivity is sensitive to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE), which is an intrinsic property determined by the crystal structure and how it is coupled to the magnetization. Coercivity is also sensitive to microstructure. Defects, precipitates, texture, and grain size all play roles in delaying the magnetic domain reversal process. Remarkably low coercivity ( < 1 A/m) can be achieved with two opposite strategies: one is the nanocrystalline approach ( < 20 nm) based on \"random-walk\" theory requiring grain sizes to be smaller than the exchange correlation length [1] ; the other is the more traditional large grain approach ( > 0.1 mm) [2] which reduces the domain wall pinning effect by grain boundaries. W e is the result of Faraday's law. Circulating currents are generated when a conductive SMM is subjected to a changing magnetic field. To minimize W e , SMMs should have higher electrical resistivity and thinner cross-sections. Magnetostriction, which describes the shape change when (de)magnetized, is also an important property for SMM. Low magnetostriction is essential for reduced operation noise and contributes to high permeability.",
                "Electrical steel with a silicon content of 3.2% (all elemental fractions are in wt.% unless otherwise noted) has been and still is the most widely used soft magnetic material. It has wellbalanced physical properties and lowest cost among all available SMMs. However, this century-old SMM is inadequate for higher frequency operation. Specifically, its relatively low electrical resistivity of 52 \u03bc cm will result in prohibitively high eddy current loss for any application with frequencies above 1 kHz, even with the laminate thickness as thin as 0.1 mm [3] . Thinner gage silicon steel bears higher costs due to the sophisticated rolling process and heat treatment required. Amorphous and nanocrystalline SMMs are the materials of choice for mid-frequency applications (1 kHz-1 MHz). They are available in a variety of thicknesses (0.02 to 0.1 mm), with resistivities as high as 135 \u03bc cm (Met-glas\u00ae Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 ). While research has allowed saturation magnetization of amorphous and nanocrystalline SMMs to gradually improve, the fundamental need for a large amount of glass forming elements (e.g., B) to lower its eutectic melting point limits the maximum magnetization. Also, the typical brittleness associated with the amorphous and nanocrystalline materials further limits their applications. Hitperm ((FeCo) 44 Zr 7 B 4 Cu 1 ) is a ductile nanocrystalline SMM, but its high cobalt and zirconium content imposes high raw materials cost. Soft ferrites are typically used in high frequency applications (1 MHz-1 GHz) due to their giga-range (10 9 ~10 12 \u03bc cm) electric resistivity. However, their low saturation magnetization ( < = 0.5 T) sets a limit on the available power density that can be achieved [4] .",
                "High silicon steel with 6.5% Si is a promising SMM for 0.4-1 kHz applications [3] . Most of its physical properties are attractive, except for its poor mechanical properties with current processing methods. It has much increased electrical resistivity (82 \u03bc cm), compared to the 52 \u03bc cm of 3% Si steel, good saturation magnetization (1.8 T), exceptionally low magnetostriction (0.1 ppm), and low losses (8 W/kg at 400 Hz and 1 T) [5] . However, the material is too brittle to be manufactured using cost-effective cold rolling methods. Increasing brittleness with silicon content is attributed to the heterogeneous formation of a B2/D0 3 ordered phase. Such brittleness can be greatly reduced if the 6.5% Si steel is rapidly cooled from the high temperature A2 disordered phase. Research shows that once the cooling rate exceeds 3.5 \u00d7 10 5 \u00b0C/s, all D0 3 phases can be suppressed and the resulting sheet is ductile [6] . Planar flow casting is a suitable method for mass-production of 6.5% Si steel sheet because of its rapid solidification rate and direct formation of thin, ductile sheets desired for higher frequency applications. But, the method has limitations on sheet width ( < 250 mm) due to melt instabilities on wide water cooled copper wheel and the requirement for surface smoothness. Here, we report a novel melt-spinning approach. Instead of continuous ribbon, it produces small ductile flakes (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.05 mm 3 ). These flakes can be easily assembled and hot-pressed into near-net-shape samples (directly producing complex shape samples through simple compaction without the need for additional machining), which will greatly simplify the motor stator/rotor fabrication processes."

                "The Fe-6.5%Si flakes were prepared by melt spinning, using a custom-built system. The nozzle orifice size was 0.8 mm by 2.7 mm, formed in the bottom of each quartz crucible. The ejection temperature, ejection pressure, and wheel speed were 1650 \u00b0C, 40-45 Torr, and 8 m/s, respectively. A copper wheel with a circumferentially grooved surface was used. Each of the grooves is 0.1 mm deep along the wheel radial direction, 0.1 mm wide along the wheel tangential direction, and 10 mm long in the wheel axial direction. The grooves serve to break up the continuous melt stream for flake formation. The spacing between each groove is 2.7 mm. A snapshot of the melting spinning process was recorded using a 12bit complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) high-speed camera. Resulting flakes were loaded into a boron nitride coated graphite die for hot pressing using a custom-built hot press. A hot pressing temperature of 800 \u00b0C and a pressure of 45 MPa were used to densify the samples. The hot-pressed samples were sintered at 1100 \u00b0C for 2 h before they were machined into rings by electrical discharge machining (EDM) for closed-loop magnetic testing. The rings were subsequently polished to the desired thickness.",
                "The inorganic coating of the flakes was done via a solution coating technique. The flakes were first placed into a beaker with 5 mol/cc Ca(NO 3 ) 2 water solution. Then 2.5 mol/cc KF aqueous solution was added slowly into the mixture with constant stirring. The flakes were then washed and dried after mixing. The organic bonded magnetic cores were coated and bonded by epoxy polymer, where flakes were mixed with 5 wt% (or ~25 vol%) epoxy, and then cold pressed into a 5 mm thick ring and cured. The same procedure was used to prepare a powder core with fully annealed ~100 \u03bcm ball milled powders.",
                "Magnetic saturation of the samples was measured by an openloop magnetic testing method using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) (Versalab, Quantum Design, Inc.). Closed-loop magnetic properties of the ring samples were measured by a Soft Magnetic Tester (SMT-700, Magnetic instrumentation). The ring samples were wound by two sets of magnet wires, one for magnetic flux density measurement, the other for applying the magnetic field. For the 0.11 mm ring measurement, five rings with an average thickness of 0.11 mm were stacked together and laminated by paper in order to increase the cross-sectional area for improved signal quality. For the polymer bonded composite rings, the magnetic flux density was measured accounting only for Fe-6.5%Si, while the nonferromagnetic portion (pores and resin) was excluded for acquiring the actual behavior of the Fe-6.5%Si materials. The same method was used on iron powder cores by others [7] .",
                "The cross-sectional images were taken using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Teneo, FEI Inc) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector. An X-ray diffractometer (Philips PANalytical X'pert Pro, PANalytical) with a cobalt target was used for the X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans. Microhardness measurements were done using Leco LM247AT micro-indentation hardness tester using a 50-gram load with 13 s dwell time. The strength and modulus of the sample were measured by 3 point flexure test according to ASTM C1151-13 with a modified span of 8 mm. The electrical resistivity measurement was done on rectangular samples using the four-wire method."

                        "The flake production process is shown in Fig. 1 a where the melt stream wets the wheel and is drawn in the rotation direction during quenching and then broken up into small fragments, forming the flakes. The flakes are rectangular cuboids (inset in Fig. 1 a) with an average size of 2.7 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 0.05 mm 3 . With tangential wheel speed increasing from 8 to 30 m/s, flake thickness can be reduced from 0.05 to 0.03 mm. Columnar grains with a strong < 001 > direction out of plane texture are present in the flakes ( Figs. 1 b and 2 a), which follows the heat extraction direction. The as-spun flakes can be readily consolidated by hot-pressing into a monolithic sample with 97.6% green density (7.30 g/cm 3 ). Pores are absent, as shown by the SEM images; however, Inter-flake boundaries (10 0-20 0 nm) are observed in the hot-pressed sample ( Fig. 1 c). Heat treatment at 1100 \u00b0C resulted in significant grain growth  ( Fig. 1 d) [8] and closure of the inter-flake boundaries. The initial growth was limited by the flake boundaries to in-plane, but eventually these boundaries disappeared and the flakes were sintered together, forming elongated grains along the flake length direction.",
                        "The as-spun flake is ductile due to the suppression of the ordered phases. Fig. 2 b shows that the (100) peak of the B2 phase and the (200) and (111) peaks of the D0 3 phase are present in the flake but in small quantities. The ordered phases are not entirely suppressed due to the relatively slow cooling rate with the 8 m/s wheel speed. As has demonstrated earlier that the degree of order gradually increases when the wheel speed is lowered [6] , and D0 3 ordering starts to appear at a wheel speed lower than 10 m/s [9] . After hot-press consolidation, significant ordering occurs as the peaks belonging to B2 and D0 3 increase significantly. The varying relative intensities of the A2 (200) peaks shown in Fig. 2 a suggests a strong preferred (200) texture in the flakes. The ratio of relative intensities of (200) to (110) peaks for the free side of the flake is 0.52 while it is 0.23 for that of randomly oriented powder sample.",

The iron losses with increasing flux density B max for 0.11 mm, 0.20 mm, and 0.33 mm ring samples cut from hot pressed and annealed bulk are shown in Fig. 3 a.

First, the hysteresis loss per cycle is fitted using the Steinmetz equation. Then, the eddy current loss is determined by the classical eddy equation where a resistivity value of 82 \u03bc cm and a density value of 7.48 g/cc were used. The anomalous loss per cycle is derived by subtracting the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss components from the total loss per cycle. It was then fitted using Bertotti anomalous loss equation. Fig. 4 shows the iron loss separation per cycle for the 0.11 mm thick sample. The Steinmetz equation shows an excellent fit with the DC hysteresis loss data at B m \u2264 0.8 T. At higher B m level, the Steinmetz equation slightly underestimates the loss due to the saturation effect. The anomalous loss equation also shows a good fit with the experimental results, though it also slightly underestimates the losses at higher B m levels. The iron loss equations for the 0.11 mm thick sample at 400 Hz and 1000 Hz are:  Comparing to the loss separation equations on Fe-6.5%Si by Wang et al. [15] , the hysteresis coefficients are smaller while the eddy current and anomalous efficiencies are larger in Eqs. ( 6) and (7) . The lower hysteresis loss, and larger eddy current and anomalous loss components of the current sample are a result of its larger thickness (0.11 mm vs. 0.03 mm) and grain sizes. Also noted is that the coefficient increases while the power exponent decreases on the anomalous loss equation at higher frequency, leading to a greater portion of anomalous loss at higher frequencies.",

No significant grain growth was observed during the hot pressing process, which is consistent with the literature [16] . However, the slow cooling encourages the formation of B2 and D0 3 phases, which contributes to the increasing hardness [17] .

                        "To prevent flakes from being sintered together and to reduce W e for thick samples, a CaF 2 coating was applied to the flakes before the hot consolidation. Fig. 6 a shows the flake surface is well covered by CaF 2 (gray contrast in image confirmed by EDS). Fig. 6 c shows the consolidated sample possesses a desirable laminated structure with thin insulation layers (0.5 to 1 \u03bcm) containing a high concentration of Ca, Si, K and O (EDS maps in Fig. 6 d). No visible pores are present. Mixed oxides of Ca, K, and Si likely formed and reacted in the interlaminate region during the hot pressing. Though having a highly negative formation enthalpy [18] , silicate should not be present due to the high silicon concentration revealed by EDS (atomic fractions (excluding oxygen) of Si, Ca, and K were 50%, 36%, and 15%). If Ca 2 SiO 4 or K 2 SiO 3 were present, the atomic fractions of Ca and K would be higher than that of the Si. The interlaminate coating is likely a SiO 2 glass with additions of CaO and K 2 O, or so-called potash lime glass. The glassy coating is beneficial, as its viscoelastic nature will allow it to spread widely during the hot pressing at 800 \u00b0C then freeze to bond the flakes at room temperature. Most importantly, the glassy coating also serves as electrically insulating layers between the Fe-6.5%Si flakes to reduce W e .",
                        "M s of the CaF 2 treated 6.5%Si steel flakes was 1.76 T, slightly lower than the 1.8 T of the uncoated flakes. The nonferromagnetic glassy coating (~2.5 vol.% by image analysis) is responsible for the decrease in M s . The coercive force of the sample is 43 A/m. The CaF 2 coated sample has good mechanical properties with a bending strength of 650 MPa. The coating significantly reduced the magnetic losses as shown in Fig. 7 a. The DC measurements show that the coating affects the permeability and the remanence B r ( Fig. 7 b). The reduction in permeability is caused by the glassy coating as it serves as an air gap between the flakes. While the decreased permeability may not be ideal for motor applications, it is still suitable for inductor applications as it can store more en-ergy per cycle at lower induction levels. [19] . Fig. 7 c shows the B-H loops at 400 Hz with B max = 1 T. It shows that the lower losses of the coated sample resulted from increased AC permeability, lower AC coercivity due to reduced eddy currents, and slightly lower B r . It is noted that the iron losses of the coated sample are higher than those of the thin laminates. This is caused by insufficient insulation due to the inhomogeneity of the coating. From the SEM image in Fig. 6 c, some flakes are misoriented; and there are several junctions with a surplus of coating, while several contacts are deprived of coating. The homogeneity of the coating should improve by optimizing the surface roughness and thickness uniformity of flakes. An increase in aspect ratio may also facilitate better flake orientation.",
                        "Polymer was also investigated as the insulating material for the flakes. Table 3 compares the magnetic behaviors of the 5% epoxy resin bonded cores made of coated flakes and coated ball milled powders. The flake core outperformed the powder core in terms of the AC iron loss at all frequencies and flux densities tested. The flake core has a higher permeability than the powder core due to flake's high aspect ratio, which leads to a lower demagnetization field than the powders. According to Aharoni [20] , the theoretical demagnetization factor for granules with an aspect ratio of one is 0.333, and for the flake, is only 0.0439 assuming a length to thickness ratio of 30:1 [20,21] . Besides, the large overall size of the flakes also allows the growth of large grains, contributing to higher magnetic permeability, which reduces the W h . Limiting the thickness of the flakes to that of the powder diameter effectively limits the W e . With reduced W h and comparable W e , the flake core therefore has lower iron losses. Compared to Somaloy 5P SMM powders by Hoganas [22] , the Fe-6.5%Si flake core sample shows about 5% lower loss.",

Fig. 8 b demonstrates the brick-wall type structure in the newly proposed flake based soft magnetic materials. The constituents of both powder and flake cores all have the same dimension in the thickness direction, i.e., ~100 \u03bcm, which limits the magnitude of the eddy current induced. However, the high aspect ratio of the flakes provides room for shape anisotropy and permeability improvement. For the sub KHz and low KHz range samples with ~100 \u03bcm thick constituents, the hysteresis loss is a significant component of the total iron losses. The improvement of permeability results in lower hysteresis loss, therefore leads to lower iron losses. It should be noted that the eddy current losses increase much more rapidly than hysteresis loss at higher frequencies and can be a major component. Recent results by Li et al.

The process starts with using a melt spinning method to make ductile flakes, then hot-pressing the ductile flakes into a bulk sample. Once shaped, the sample is annealed at 1100 \u00b0C to induce the ordered phases for favorable magnetic properties. This method allows the preparation of bulk high silicon steel with high permeability and low iron losses. The utilization of small flakes enables near net shape processing and the manipulation of crystal anisotropy and shape anisotropy. Thin hot pressed and annealed laminates exhibit low iron losses comparable to that of commercial 6.5%Si laminates by the CVD/diffusion process. Thick parts from these laminates suffer from high eddy current loss but coating the flakes with CaF 2 effectively lowers the total losses. Epoxy coated flake inductor cores show improved DC and AC magnetic properties over epoxy coated powder cores due to reduced shape anisotropy, with 5% lower losses than the commercially available Somaloy powder cores. The novel application of macroscopic flakes as building blocks shows great potential for both motor and power electronics applications."
