## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The disclosure may be understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the drawings as described below. It is noted that, for purposes of illustrative clarity, certain elements in various drawings may not be drawn to scale. The embodiments of the inventive methods and apparatus described herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the inventive methods and apparatus to precise forms disclosed. Rather, the embodiments selected for description have been chosen to enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention.

In the disclosure, the glass-forming ability of each alloy is quantified by the “critical plate thickness,” defined as the largest plate thickness in which the amorphous phase can be formed when processed by a method of casting the molten alloy in a copper mold having a prismatic cavity (i.e. a cavity having a rectangular cross section), where at least one dimension of the prismatic cavity is less than 50% of at least one other dimension of the prismatic cavity.

A “critical cooling rate,” which is defined as the cooling rate required to avoid crystallization and form the amorphous phase of the metallic glass-forming alloy (i.e. the metallic glass), determines the critical plate thickness. The lower the critical cooling rate of a metallic glass-forming alloy, the larger its critical plate thickness. The critical cooling rate Rc in K/s and critical plate thickness tc in mm are related via the following approximate empirical formula:

Rc=1000/tc2  EQ. (1)

According to EQ. (1), the critical cooling rate for a metallic glass-forming alloy having a critical casting thickness of about 1 mm is about 103 K/s.

Generally, three categories are known in the art for identifying the ability of a metal alloy to form a metallic glass (i.e. to bypass the stable crystal phase and form an amorphous phase). Alloys having critical cooling rates in excess of 1012 K/s are typically referred to as non-glass formers, as it is physically impossible to achieve such cooling rates over a meaningful thickness. Alloys having critical cooling rates in the range of 105 to 1012 K/s are typically referred to as marginal glass formers, as they are able to form metallic glass foils or ribbons with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers according to EQ. (1). Metal alloys having critical cooling rates on the order of 103 or less, and as low as 1 or 0.1 K/s, are typically referred to as bulk glass formers, as they are able to form metallic glass plates with thicknesses ranging from 1 millimeter to several centimeters. The glass-forming ability of a metallic alloy is, to a very large extent, dependent on the composition of the metallic glass-forming alloy. The compositional ranges for alloys that are marginal glass formers are considerably broader than those for bulk glass formers. Among all metals, Zr is the base metal having the most discovered alloy combinations of forming a metallic glass. Various Zr-based metallic glass-forming alloys have been discovered, some marginal glass formers (capable of forming only micron thick ribbons) while others bulk glass formers (capable of forming only centimeter thick plates).

Often in the art, a measure of glass forming ability of an alloy is reported as the critical rod diameter instead of the critical plate thickness. Due to its symmetry, the diameter of a rod for which a certain cooling rate is achieved at its centerline is about twice the thickness of a plate for which the same cooling rate is achieved at its centerline. Hence, the critical rod diameter to achieve a critical cooling rate is about twice the critical plate thickness to achieve the same critical cooling rate. Therefore, a critical rod diameter can be approximately converted to a critical plate thickness by dividing by 2.

To characterize, specify, and quantify the color of metal alloys, the modern CIELAB coordinate system is used, originating from the 1948 3D color space of Hunter (Hunter, Richard Sewall (July 1948). “Photoelectric Color-Difference Meter.” JOSA 38 (7): 661. (Proceedings of the Winter Meeting of the Optical Society of America), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In Hunter's color space, the color of a metal alloy is characterized by three optically measurable coordinates a*, b*, and L* that respectively map color onto a red-green, blue-yellow, and color intensity (i.e. luminance) scales. The color of any particular metal alloy is determined using a common optical spectrometer to measure its a*, b*, and L* coordinates in color space. The ability to produce alloys with specified ranges of color coordinates is key to the design and use of gold alloys in commercial products.

Owing to their high hardness, which is far superior to conventional (i.e. crystalline) metals, metallic glasses were thought of as attractive materials for cosmetic metal applications (e.g. for watches or other luxury goods). Recently, considerable interest has been demonstrated in the design of metallic glasses having cosmetic appearance and color within specified color coordinates. One cosmetic color attribute currently of interest is the lightness—also referred to as reflectivity—quantified by the CIELAB coordinate L*. The reflectivity of metallic glasses, particularly Zr-based metallic glasses, is generally low compared to conventional metal alloys that are currently used as cosmetic products (e.g. stainless steel). In Table 1, data for the CIELAB color coordinates L*, a*, and b* of various known Zr-based metallic glasses is presented together with data for AISI 316 stainless steel. In FIG. 1 the reflectivity of the various Zr-based metallic glasses is compared against the reflectivity of AISI 316 stainless steel. As seen in Table 1 and FIG. 1, Zr-based metallic gasses Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10, Zr58Cu22Fe8Al12, Zr56Ni25Nb4Al15, and Zr57Nb5Cu15.4Ni12.6Al12.5 have L* values below 78, while AISI 316 stainless steel has an L* value of 84.6. This deficiency renders Zr-based metallic glasses inferior to conventional alloys such as stainless steel in cosmetic metal applications.

To overcome this limitation, Zr-based metallic glasses having reflectivity L* approaching that of the incumbent crystalline metal alloys while being able to form in bulk dimensions are desired. As such, Zr-based metallic glass-forming alloys having a high glass-forming ability and where the metallic glasses formed from the alloys demonstrate a high reflectivity would be attractive materials for cosmetic metal applications. As discussed above, discovering compositional regions where a metal alloy demonstrates a high glass forming ability is unpredictable. Discovering compositional regions where a metallic glass demonstrates a high reflectivity L* is equally unpredictable. Discovering compositional regions where both a high glass forming ability and a high reflectivity L* coexist is even more unpredictable than the two cases above, because the compositional region where a metallic glass-forming alloy would demonstrate a high glass forming ability would not necessarily coincide with the compositional regions where a metallic glass would demonstrate a high reflectivity L*. In some embodiments of the disclosure, a critical plate thickness of at least 2 mm and a reflectivity L* of at least 78 are considered adequate for qualifying the metallic glass as suitable for cosmetic metal applications.

In this disclosure, compositional regions in the Zr—Co—Ni—Al and Zr—Ti—Co—Ni—Al alloys are disclosed where the metallic glass-forming alloys demonstrate a high glass forming ability while the metallic glasses formed from the alloys exhibit a high reflectivity. In embodiments of the disclosure, the metallic glass-forming alloys demonstrate a critical plate thickness of at least 2 mm, while the metallic glasses formed from the alloys demonstrate a CIELAB L* value of at least 78. In some embodiments, the critical plate thickness is at least 3 mm, in other embodiments the critical plate thickness is at least 4 mm, while in yet other embodiments the critical plate thickness is at least 5 mm. In some embodiments, the CIELAB L* value is at least 78.2, while in other embodiments at least 78.4.

Another cosmetic color attribute that metallic glasses generally fall short of is the CIELAB b* coordinate, which represents the yellow/blue opponent colors. Many Zr-based metallic glasses have relatively high b* values, which is considerably higher than conventional metal alloys that are currently used as cosmetic products (e.g. stainless steel). In Table 1 and FIG. 2 the b* values of various known Zr-based metallic glasses are compared against that of AISI 316 stainless steel. As seen in Table 1 and FIG. 2, Cu-bearing Zr-based metallic gasses Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10, Zr58Cu22Fe8Al12, and Zr57Nb5Cu15.4Ni12.6Al12.5 have b* values ranging from about 3.7 to about 5.5, while Cu-free Zr-based metallic glass Zr56Ni25Nb4Al15 has a b* value of about 3. On the other hand, AISI 316 stainless steel has a b* value of 2.6. This deficiency renders Zr-based metallic glasses, especially those bearing Cu, inferior to conventional alloys such as stainless steel in cosmetic metal applications. In some embodiments of the disclosure, a CIELAB b* value of equal to or less than 3.5 is considered adequate for qualifying the metallic glass for cosmetic metal applications. In other embodiments, a CIELAB b* value of equal to or less than 3.25 may be adequate for such applications, while in yet other embodiments a CIELAB b* value of equal to or less than 3 may be adequate for such applications.

Another property of the metallic glass that may be regarded as critical for engineering metal applications, including cosmetic metal applications, is the toughness of the metallic glass. The notch toughness, defined as the stress intensity factor at crack initiation Kq, is the measure of the material's ability to resist fracture in the presence of a notch. A high Kq ensures that the material will be tough in the presence of defects. In embodiments of the disclosure, a notch toughness of at least 70 MPa m1/2 is considered adequate for qualifying the metallic glass for cosmetic metal applications. In other embodiments, a notch toughness of at least 80 MPa m1/2 may be adequate for such application, while in yet other embodiments a notch toughness of at least 90 MPa m1/2 may be adequate for such application.

The disclosure is also directed to methods of forming a metallic glass, or an article made of a metallic glass, from the metallic glass-forming alloy. In various embodiments, a metallic glass is formed by heating and melting an alloy ingot under inert atmosphere to create a molten alloy, and subsequently quenching the molten alloy fast enough to avoid crystallization of the molten alloy. In one embodiment, prior to cooling the molten alloy is heated to at least 100° C. above the liquidus temperature of the metallic glass-forming alloy. In another embodiment, prior to quenching the molten alloy is heated to at least 200° C. above the liquidus temperature of the metallic glass-forming alloy. In another embodiment, prior to quenching the molten alloy is heated to at least 1100° C. In yet another embodiment, prior to quenching the molten alloy is heated to at least 1200° C. In one embodiment, the alloy ingot is heated and melted using a plasma arc. In another embodiment, the alloy ingot is heated and melted using an induction coil. In some embodiments, the alloy ingot is heated and melted over a water-cooled hearth, or within a water-cooled crucible. In one embodiment, the hearth or crucible is made of copper. In some embodiments, the inert atmosphere comprises argon gas. In some embodiments, quenching of the molten alloy is performed by injecting or pouring the molten alloy into a metal mold. In some embodiments, the mold can be made of copper, brass, or steel, among other materials. In some embodiments, injection of the molten alloy is performed by a pneumatic drive, a hydraulic drive, an electric drive, or a magnetic drive. In some embodiments, pouring the molten alloy into a metal mold is performed by tilting a tundish containing the molten alloy.

The disclosure is also directed to methods of thermoplastically shaping a metallic glass into an article. In some embodiments, heating of the metallic glass is performed by conduction to a hot surface. In other embodiments, heating of the metallic glass to a softening temperature To above the glass transition temperature Tg is performed by inductive heating. In yet other embodiments, heating of the metallic glass to a softening temperature To above the glass transition temperature Tg is performed by ohmic heating. In one embodiment, the ohmic heating is performed by the discharge of at least one capacitor. In some embodiments, the application of the deformational force to thermoplastically shape the softened metallic glass in the supercooled liquid region is performed by a pneumatic drive, a hydraulic drive, an electric drive, or a magnetic drive.

Specific embodiments of metallic glasses formed of metallic glass-forming alloys with compositions according to the formula Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx are presented in Table 2. In these alloys, Al is varied at the expense Zr, where the atomic fraction of Al increases from 7.5 to 20 percent as the atomic fraction of Zr decreases from 62.5 to 50 percent, while the atomic fractions of Co and Ni are fixed at 17.5 and 12.5 percent, respectively.

The critical plate thicknesses values of the example alloys according to the composition formula Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx are listed in Table 2, and are plotted in FIG. 3. As shown in Table 2 and FIG. 3, substituting Zr by Al according to Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx results in varying glass forming ability. Specifically, the critical plate thickness increases from less than 2 mm for the metallic glass-forming alloy containing 7.5 atomic percent Al (Example 1) to 2 mm for the metallic glass-forming alloy containing 7.5 atomic percent Al (Example 2), reaches the highest value of 3 mm for the metallic glass-forming alloys containing 12.5 and 15 atomic percent Al (Examples 3 and 4), and decreases back to 2 mm for the metallic glass-forming alloy containing 17.5 atomic percent Al (Example 5) and to less than 2 mm for the metallic glass-forming alloy containing 20 atomic percent Al (Example 6). Therefore, in the range where the Al content varies between 10 and 17.5 atomic percent, the critical plate thickness of Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx metallic glasses is at least 2 mm.

Specifically, L* decreases with increasing Al content, from a high value of 78.48 for the metallic glass containing 10 atomic percent Al (Example 2) to 78.01 for the metallic glass containing 17.5 atomic percent Al (Example 5). Therefore, in the range where the Al content is equal to or less than 17.5 atomic percent, the reflectivity of Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx metallic glasses is at least 78.

Therefore, in the range where the Al content varies between 10 and 17.5 atomic percent, the b* value of Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx metallic glasses is less than 3.2. Lastly, the CIELAB a* value decreases slightly with increasing Al content, from a high value of 0.62 for the metallic glass containing 10 atomic percent Al (Example 2) to 0.59 for the metallic glass containing 17.5 atomic percent Al (Example 5).

The KQ values listed in Table 4 are plotted in FIG. 7. As shown in Table 4 and FIG. 7, substituting Zr by Al according to Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx results in varying KQ. Specifically, in the range where the Al content varies between 10 and 15 atomic percent, KQ has a high value ranging between 84.8 and 103.6 MPa m1/2. However, KQ drops considerably at higher Al content, dripping to a value of 26.5 MPa m1/2 when the Al content is 17.5 atomic percent. Therefore, in the range where the Al content is less than 17.5 atomic percent, the notch toughness of Zr70-xCo17.5Ni12.5Alx metallic glasses is at least 80 MPa m1/2.

Specifically, L* is high (equal to or greater than 78) only within a narrow range of Ni content, and is low (less than 77) outside this optimum Ni content range. For the metallic glass containing 7.5 atomic percent Ni (Example 12), L* has a low value of 76.98. L* increases to above 78 with increasing Ni content beyond 7.5 atomic percent, reaching a value of 78.17 for the metallic glass containing 10 atomic percent Ni (Example 13). L* is above 78 for the metallic glasses containing 10, 12.5, 15, and 17.5 atomic percent Ni, varying between 78.08 and 78.49 (Examples 3, and 13-15). For the metallic glass containing 20 atomic percent Ni (Example 16), L* falls below 78 to a low value of 76.67. Therefore, in the range where the Ni content is greater than 7.5 atomic percent and less than 20 atomic percent, the reflectivity of Zr57.5Co30-xNixAl12.5 metallic glasses is at least 78.

The CIELAB b* values listed in Table 8 are plotted in FIG. 15. As shown in Table 8 and FIG. 15, substituting Co by Ni according to Zr57.5Co30-xNixAl12.5 results in varying b*. Specifically, b* is low (equal to or less than 3.5) only within a narrow range of Ni content, and is low (above 3.5) outside this optimum Ni content range. For the metallic glass containing 7.5 atomic percent Ni (Example 12), b* has a high value of 4.23. The value of b* decreases to below 3.5 with increasing Ni content beyond 7.5 atomic percent, reaching a value of 3.27 for the metallic glass containing 10 atomic percent Ni (Example 13).
