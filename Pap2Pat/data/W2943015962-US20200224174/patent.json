                        "Nucleic acid therapeutics have the potential to treat or cure many diseases that are difficult to address with more traditional therapies.1 Delivery of exogenous nucleic acids to host cells allows therapeutic proteins to be produced that retain native conformations and post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation)2,3 that are sometimes difficult to achieve with recombinant proteins. Synthetic mRNA in particular is attractive for its improved safety profile relative to viral or DNA-based modalities; the likelihood of genomic integration is low, and hence oncogenesis is less of a concern.4 These advantages make synthetic mRNA an attractive platform for vaccines, cancer therapeutics, and therapies that compensate for (or correct) genetic defects, among others.5",
                        "Unfortunately, synthetic RNAs degrade rapidly in recipient cells, limiting their therapeutic utility. A synthetic RNA's persistence can be extended by biological modifications (such as enzymatic capping and polyadenylation) and incorporation of chemically modified nucleotides,6-8 but even modified RNAs often remain active in cells for only several days,9 making them unsuitable for long-term gene therapy. One alternative approach is to employ replicons derived from alphaviruses, positive-strand RNAs that encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which simultaneously translate therapeutic payloads and self-amplify the replicon on entry in to the cytoplasm.10 Typically, therapeutic replicons are constructed by retaining the UTRs, non-structural proteins and subgenomic promoter (SGP) of the parent alphavirus, but the structural proteins in the subgenomic region are either fused with genes of experimental or therapeutic interest, or replaced with therapeutic genes and combined with helper constructs encoding structural proteins for making viral particles. Replicons delivered as non-replicating viral replicon particles or as synthetic RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles have shown promise as vaccine vectors,11,12 for expression of therapeutic agents in cancer immunotherapy,13,14 and for correction of genetic defects, such as hemophilia.15"

                        "A virus is a small pathogen that is only capable of replication inside a living host cell (e.g., prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells). Outside of living cells, viruses exist as independent particles (e.g., viral particles or virions), which comprise genetic material in the form of DNA or RNA, the latter of which can be single-stranded or double-stranded. Viruses with DNA are referred to as DNA viruses, and viruses with RNA are referred to as RNA viruses. In some cases, the virus comprises nucleic acid-associated proteins and the combination of the virus and nucleic acid-associated proteins is referred to as nucleoprotein. In addition to the genetic material, viruses have a single or double protein coat, also known as a capsid, which facilitates attachment of the virus to a living host cell's receptors during infection and protects the genetic material of the virus from enzymatic degradation. The combination of nucleoprotein and the capsid is referred to as a nucleocapsid. In some cases, viruses have a lipid bilayer envelope, studded with virus-coded, glycosylated (trans-) membrane-associated proteins. Once a virus has infected a living host cell, the virus is dependent on the living host cell to supply the machinery for its replication, and propagation thereafter. The viral genome codes for some structural proteins and non-structural regulatory proteins.24",

Non-limiting examples of such structural proteins include nucleocapsid core proteins (e.g., gag proteins), enzymes packaged within the virus particle (e.g., pol proteins), and membrane components (e.g., env proteins). In contrast, the term \u201cnon-structural protein,\u201d as used in the context of viruses herein, refer to proteins that are expressed within the host cell but do not constitute structural components of the virus particle or virion. Some of the roles of non-structural proteins include, but are not limited to, replicon formation, immunomodulation, and transactivation of structural protein genes.25",

                                "In order to identify mutations in the replicon that impact the persistence and strength of expression of payload genes under the subgenomic promoter, an in vitro evolution strategy was designed using VEE replicons deleted of genes encoding the structural proteins, to focus the mutational screen on the nonstructural proteins involved in RNA replication and host machinery interactions. Although many replicon studies are carried out using BHK-21 cells that are deficient in interferon signaling, human Jurkat cells were employed here that have a functional interferon pathway for transfection and passage of replicons, in order to potentially select for mutations limiting the host cell interferon response. It was hypothesized that extended culture of replicon-transfected cells combined with repeated enrichment of highly-expressing cells would select for replicons bearing favorable mutations. VEE replicons expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry from the subgenomic region were synthesized by in vitro transcription (IVT) and transfected into Jurkat cells. Based on prior studies estimating RNA virus mutation rates,39,40 the transfected cells were cultured for 60 days, sorting the top 20% of mCherry-expressing cells by flow cytometry approximately every 10 days. The percentage of mCherryhi cells and mean fluorescence intensity of mCherry expression increased with each sort (FIG. 1A), suggesting that mutations in either the replicon RNA or changes in the host Jurkat cells were favoring replicon persistence and stronger subgenome expression.",
                                "The percentage of mCherry-positive cells began to plateau after 6 sorts (FIGS. 6A-6B), and thus cells were selected from the 5th sort for sequencing to assess potential mutations arising in the replicon. Total RNA was isolated from the sorted Jurkat cells isolated in this sort, reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and amplicons from seven overlapping regions covering the nonstructural proteins (loci L1-L7) were each separately cloned into plasmid vectors (FIG. 1B). Plasmids expressing the amplicon constructs were transfected into E. coli, and 6 colonies from each amplicon were isolated for Sanger sequencing. Each of the 7 amplified regions was treated as a genetic locus, and each clone bearing one or more mutations as an allele at that locus. Mutations were identified in 3 of the loci, L2, L4, and L5. The wild type alleles at each of these loci were named A, B, and C, respectively, while mutant alleles were assigned lowercase letters: A recovered amplicon sequence containing a synonymous point mutation in L2 was named allele a; two different mutant alleles identified in L4 were named b1 and b2; and two mutant alleles in L5 were named c1 (bearing one point mutation) and c2 (containing two point mutations) (FIG. 1C). Using this nomenclature, a replicon construct is specified by which alleles it bears at these three loci. The 3 WT (A, B, C) and 5 mutant alleles (a, b1, b2, c1, c2) from these 3 loci combine to give 18 total potential variants made up of unique WT/mutant allele combinations (Table 1). Replicon ABC, for example, is the wild-type replicon, while replicon ab2C has the mutant a allele at L2 and the mutant b2 allele at L4, but the wild-type C allele at L5. As shown in FIG. 1B, the mutations were located in the D1/D2 and methyltransferase-like domains of nsP2 and the Macro and alphavirus unique domain (AUD) of nsP3."

Each replicon was transfected into Jurkat cells and mCherry expression was tracked for 7 days using flow cytometry. Allele a had minimal impact on the proportion of cells expressing replicon or the level of subgenome expression (FIG. 2A). By contrast, alleles b1 and b2 increased the intensity of mCherry expression approximately 3-fold compared to the wild-type replicon (FIG. 2B). Alleles c1 and c2 alone elicited minor changes in expression relative to the WT replicon (FIG. 2C), but when c1 was combined with allele b1, the durability of mCherry expression over time was further enhanced (FIGS. 2D-2E). Summarizing the kinetic data in a plot of the day 1 mCherry mean fluorescence intensity vs. the rate of mCherry expression loss over time, the most improved replicons relative to the WT ABC sequence are readily identified, with mutants Ab1C and Ab1c1 showing particularly high levels of transgene expression combined with the lowest expression decay rates."

                                "During alphavirus transcription by the nsPs, both copies of the entire replicon genome and shorter transcripts of only the subgenome are produced. Thus the impact of the replicon mutations on levels of intracellular subgenome vs. whole replicon genome transcripts was next evaluated. Relative levels of nonstructural proteins (FIG. 3A) and mCherry (FIG. 3B) transcripts in Jurkat cells transfected with all 18 replicons were measured by qPCR. Cells transfected with replicons Ab1C, ab1C, Ab2C, ab2C, Ab1c1, ab1c2, Ab1c2, and ab1c2 had 10-18 times more replicon RNA compared to cells transfected with the wild-type (ABC) replicon (FIG. 3A). Subgenomic RNA levels of mCherry RNA generally correlated with the nsP RNA levels. (FIG. 3B). Because alleles b1 and b2 at locus 4 demonstrated higher overall mCherry expression (FIG. 2A), this indicates that alleles b1 and b2 increase replicon RNA levels as well as mCherry subgenomic RNA level compared to the wild-type allele B, and that alleles c1 and c2 in Locus 5 suppress this effect in replicons with allele b2 but not allele b1.",
                                "When comparing the level of mCherry transcripts to whole replicon genome RNA, constructs with allele C (the wild-type) at Locus 5 had ratios of 1000-1500. In contrast, replicons with allele c2 demonstrated lower relative subgenome expression, with mCherry/nsP ratios of around 500. Replicons carrying allele c1 had widely varying mCherry/nsP ratios, ranging from 500 to 1500, depending on the presence of other mutations (FIG. 3C). Taken together, these data suggest that alleles b1 and b2 (locus 4) increase levels of replicon RNA, while alleles c1 and c2 (locus 5) decrease subgenomic transcription. The effects of alleles \u03b1 (locus 2) and c1 (locus 5) are highly context-sensitive, depending on which alleles are at the other two loci.",
                                "The mechanism that led to some mutant replicons being present in cells at levels 10 to 18-fold higher than wild type were of interest, because it was reasoned that these mutations may aid the replicon in escaping the cell's innate interferon response, which is activated by viral RNA and limits its replication.19-21,23 To test this hypothesis, all 18 replicons were transfected into RAW-Lucia\u2122 ISG cells, which secrete luciferase in response to interferon.41,42 Levels of mCherry transcripts correlated with the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of mCherry (FIG. 3D), and the MFI of mCherry in the RAW-Lucia\u2122 ISG cells showed similar trends as were observed in Jurkat cells (FIG. 7), suggesting that MFI of mCherry indicates the abundance of mCherry transcripts, and the replicon replication and expression dynamics are similar in these reporter cells. Thus, the IFN responses (Luminescence) versus the MFI of mCherry in RAW-Lucia\u2122 ISG cells transfected with 18 replicons was compared (FIG. 3E). Five of six mutant replicons with allele c2 showed lower IFN responses, suggesting the allele c2 reduce IFN responses by restriction of subgenomic transcription (FIG. 3C). Similarly, 4 of 6 mutant replicons with allele c1 decreased IFN responses, suggesting the allele c1 is involved in escaping of IFN responses. Unexpectedly, 5 of 6 mutant replicons with allele b2 also showed less IFN response, possibly because of the effects of low subgenomic expression by allele b2 (FIG. 2E). In contrast, 4 of 6 mutant replicons with allele b1 showed higher IFN responses, possibly because of the stimulation of IFN responses by more replicon RNA (FIG. 3A) as well as more subgenomic transcripts (FIG. 3B). The allele a, however, demonstrated more complicated effects on IFN responses, depending on presences of other alleles. Taken together, using Jurkat cells, several mutant alleles with altered interactions between the replicon and host cell's innate immune response were successfully screened out, though mechanisms underlying these changes may be complicated.",
                                "Interestingly, although mutants were found with a lower interferon response (e.g., aBc1 and aBc2), these replicons did not provide the best performance in terms of subgenome transgene expression (FIGS. 2C, 2F, and 3E).",
                                "The IVE screen identified 5 non-synonymous mutations associated with enhanced expression in Jurkat cells in vitro. Allele b1 carried a favorable mutation in nsP2, a non-structural protein that has previously been shown to regulate the cytopathic effect of alphavirus infection.28,29 The mutation in allele b2 was located in the macrodomain of nsP3 but had similar effects on expression strength as allele b1, consistent with prior art teaching that the protease and MTase domains in nsP2 and the macrodomain and AUD in nsP3 function as a compact complex.43 Alleles c1 and c2 carried mutations in nsP3 which is involved in subgenomic transcription.30 Herein, these alleles suppressed expression in combination with allele b2 but enhanced the durability of expression when combined with allele b1, suggesting that replicon transcription and subgenomic transcription are independent but related events.",
                                "In summary, five of the six mutations had a significant impact on replicon persistence and gene expression levels. Two mutations in nsP2 and nsP3 enhanced transgene expression, while mutations in nsP3 were identified that regulated this expression by suppressing subgenomic transcription. Interestingly, some of these mutations also altered the strength of the host cell's interferon response to the replicons."

As a preliminary exploration of this application, WT or mutant Ab1c1 replicons expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2) under the SGP were generated. IL-2 is a potent cytokine that promotes the proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells.48 First, the secretion of IL-2 from transfected tumor cells in vitro was evaluated. As shown in FIG. 5A, even in vitro, replicon expression in B16F10 tumor cells transfected with WT replicon ABC encoding IL-2 decayed to near baseline by 48 hr., while secreted IL-2 protein was detected over at least 3 days in culture from the mutant replicons and at much higher levels than the WT construct. To assess replicon-based IL-2 expression in vivo, lipid nanoparticles carrying RNA were injected into established B 16F10 tumors, and IL-2 transcript levels were measured by PCR 3 days post injection. As shown in FIG. 5B, tumor samples injected with Ab1c1 replicons expressed 5.5-fold more transcripts than the WT replicon. Tumors with the Ab1c1 mutant replicon showed 2.1-fold more infiltrating CD8 T cells than the wild-type ABC replicon (FIG. 5C). A significant decrease in tumor growth was also observed (FIG. 5D) and improved survival (FIG. 5E) from the Ab1c1 mutant IL-2 expressing replicon compared to both the ABC IL-2 replicon, the ABC replicon without IL-2 and the vehicle control.",

When injected into murine B16F10 melanoma tumors, the optimal mutant replicons identified here encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-2 significantly improved treatment of murine B16F10 melanoma through improved maintenance of CD8 T cells and significantly slowed tumor growth. Administered intratumorally, the best-performing mutant replicon showed strong transgene expression in vivo a week after administration, contrasting with rapid decay of expression from the wild type replicon. This increase in the strength and persistence of gene expression led to increased anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse melanoma model. Thus, implementation of this unique method of in vitro evolution allowed for the identification of therapeutically useful mutations and, when delivered in vivo, these mutant replicons may be useful for improved replicon-based RNA therapeutics for vaccination, cancer immunotherapy, and gene therapy. Further refinements in replicon design hold promise for controllable expression of antigens and immunomodulatory factors."
