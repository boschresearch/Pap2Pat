Unfortunately, preoperative US-guided localization of the positive axillary lymph node associated with a metallic identifier or biopsy marker or clip can often be suboptimal or unsuccessful. The reasons for these detection failures are observed to be multifactorial arid include poor sonographic conspicuity of the marker, as well as extrusion of the marker from the metastatic lymph node, which normalizes in size and morphology during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",
                        "Thus, because numerous currently available metallic biopsy markers are difficult to visualize by ultrasound, there is an unmet clinical need for radiologists to be able to detect treatment site or biopsy markers by ultrasound, even several months after marker placement.",

In the case of kidney stones, this twinkling artifact, is visible on color Doppler ultrasound examinations as a rapid alternation of color immediately behind the stationary echogenic stones, representing a false appearance of movement. These twinkling artifacts may also manifest when power Doppler and spectral Doppler scans are performed, where the twinkling artifacts appear as a sign of heterogeneous spectral expansion composed of adjacent vertical lines with no waveform."

                        "Described here are markers (e.g., treatment site markers, biopsy site markers, fiducial markers, localizers) that are composed of a non-metallic material having a composition and/or other features or characteristics such that the markers will generate twinkling artifacts when imaged with ultrasound. In this way, the composition of the markers enables their detection and localization using ultrasound. The markers are generally composed of non-metallic materials whose physical and/or chemical properties enhance the twinkling artifact, thereby resulting in a twinkling \u201csignature\u201d that can be readily detected with ultrasound imaging. Advantageously, the markers are composed of a material that will produce consistent and obvious \u201cpointers\u201d in an ultrasound image using the twinkling artifact phenomenon. As such, these twinkling artifacts delineate the position of a marker placed within a region-of-interest, such as a lymph node or breast lesion, prior to and/or after treatment, such as neoadjuvant treatment.",
                        "In some implementations, the ultrasound system being used can be configured to provide haptic and/or audio feedback for the user during a procedure. For instance, the ultrasound system can be configured to detect the twinkling artifact from an implanted marker and in response generate a haptic response, an audio feedback signal, or both.",
                        "It is another aspect of the present disclosure to provide markers that can be constructed with features that can be tuned to a specific frequency so that ultrasound can insonate specifically at that frequency allowing for reliable detection.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1, an example of a marker 10 that can be implemented in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. The marker 10 can have any suitable shape, including a generally cylindrical shape, a rectangular shape, a spherical shape, an ellipsoidal shape, a spiral shape, a coiled shape, a threaded shape, a helical shape, and so on. In other implementations, the marker 10 can be a clip or other instrument or device for implantation or insertion. For instance, the marker 10 can in some examples be a biopsy clip. In some implementations, the marker 10 can be sized to fit in standard needles for implantation, such as an 18-gauge needle. In other implementations, the marker 10 can be adhered, affixed, or otherwise coupled to a medical instrument or device to facilitate localization, guidance, and/or tracking of that medical instrument or device using ultrasound. In still other implementations, described in more detail below, the marker 10 can be a coating that is applied to another object, which may include a metallic marker.",
                        "In general, the marker 10 is composed of a suitable non-metallic material that will cause the marker 10 to generate a twinkling artifact when imaged using ultrasound, such as Doppler ultrasound, as shown in FIG. 2. For instance, the marker 10 can be composed of a non-metallic material having formed therein features 12 that are constructed to generate twinkling artifacts. As one example, the features can be air bubbles, or other gas-filled or fluid-filled bubbles. In general, the features 12 can be inherent physical and/or chemical characteristics of the material from which the marker 10 is composed. Additionally or alternatively, the features 12 can include fractures, cracks, pockets, pores, or other deformations, which may be filled with air or other gases or fluids. The features 12 can be formed entirely internal to the body 14 of the marker 10, or can be formed such that they extend to and at least partially break the outer surface 16 of the marker 10.",
                        "In some implementations, the features 12 are filled with a gas that is selected to be slowly diffusing from the marker 10 into the tissue. The gas can be trapped in the body 14 of the marker 10 using chemical engineering techniques, mechanical techniques, or the like. For instance, the features 12 can be mechanically formed in the body 14 of the marker 10, such as by applying a suitable stress, strain, pressure, or other mechanical force to the body 14 of the marker.",
                        "As described above, the marker 10 is composed of a non-metallic material into which features 12 such as bubbles, fractures, cracks, pockets, pores, or other deformations are formed. In general, non-metallic materials exclude those materials that are entirely or substantially composed of elemental metals or metal alloys. As described below, however, non-metallic materials can include trace or other small amounts of metal, such as when doping the non-metallic material with metal-based contrast agents (e.g., contrast agents containing metal salts, metal chelates, and the like). The material can be any suitable non-metallic and biocompatible material. Advantageously, the features 12 are physical and/or chemical characteristics of the body 14 itself (i.e., of the materials of which the body 14 is composed). In some implementations, the marker 10 can be composed of biodegradable materials, such that the marker 10 will naturally breakdown when inserted into a subject's tissue.",
                        "As one example, the material can be a porous polymer, such as bone cement, or polymethyl methacrylate (\u201cPMMA\u201d). Advantageously, the pores in such a porous polymer can act as the features 12 that are constructed to generate twinkling artifacts. Markers 10 composed of PMMA or other porous polymers can he manufactured using laser cutting or other fabrication techniques to form the markers 10 from a substrate of porous polymer. An example of a marker 10 composed of a porous polymer is shown in FIG. 3. This marker 10 was made from a thin wafer of PMMA and cut to size using laser technology. The surface roughness and the internal pores can be seen on this micro-CT image performed at 5 micrometer resolution. FIG. 4 shows scanning electron microscope images of the marker shown in FIG. 3. The SEM images shows the presence of pores, fractures, and surface roughness in the marker. In some implementations, images of a porous polymer marker can be used to generate 3D printing instructions; that is, the images can be used as source data for a 3D printed marker.",
                        "As another example, the material can be artificial uric acid. As one non-limiting example, the marker 10 can be composed of artificial uric acid that has been prepared by compressing the artificial uric acid under pressure, such as a pressure between 150-450 MPa. As still another example, the marker 10 can be composed of a resin, such as a dental composite resin or other synthetic resin.",
                        "In some instances, the marker 10 can be manufactured using an additive manufacturing process, such as 3D printing, stereolithography (SLA), or the like. As one non-limiting example, the marker 10 can be manufactured using SLA or other 3D printing techniques in order to form the body 14 of the marker 10 as having a plurality of pores as the features 12 that are constructed to generate twinkling artifacts. The pores may be micrometer sized pores, millimeter sized pores, or combinations thereof. As one non-limiting example, the pores can be sized to have diameters between 0.5 mm and 1 mm, such as 0.5 mm, 0.6 mm, or 1 mm. In another non-limiting example, the pores can have diameters in the range of 1 \u03bcm to 500 \u03bcm, which in some instances may be in the range of 1 \u03bcm to 80 \u03bcm. The pores may be uniform in size, or may have different sizes throughout the body 14 of the marker 10.",
                        "As another non-limiting example, the marker 10 can be manufactured using SLA or other 3D printing techniques in order to form the body 14 of the marker 10 as having a plurality of extruded and/or protruded surface features as the features 12 that are constructed to generate twinkling artifacts. For example, the body 14 can be constructed to have protrusions on the outer surface 16 of the body 14, such as wave-like protrusion; straight-line extrusions, which may form a grid or otherwise intersect with each other; or the like. In the example shown in FIG. 5, the marker 10 is constructed as a three-dimensional gridded structure, such as a grid lattice structure. In the examples shown in FIG. 6, the markers 10 are constructed to have wave-like protrusions on the outer surface. As shown, the markers 10 may also include apertures or other openings in the body 14.",
                        "As still another non-limiting example, the marker 10 can be manufactured using SLA or other 3D printing or additive manufacturing techniques in order to form the body 14 of the marker 10 as shown in FIG. 7. In this example, the features 12 that are constructed to generate twinkling artifacts can include pores 70 or other apertures formed in the outer surface 16 of the body 14 and/or contained within the inner volume of the body 14. The features 12 can also include one or more hollow tubes 72 that are formed within the body 14. The hollow tube(s) 72 may be formed to be contained completely within the inner volume of the body 14, or may extend to the outer surface 16 of the body 14, such that the hollow tube(s) 72 form an opening (e.g., an aperture) at the outer surface 16 of the body 14. The hollow tube(s) 72 may have a regular and/or uniform shape, or may have an arbitrary shape, such as shown in the example of FIG. 7. More generally, other forms of voids in the fill material used in the additive manufacturing process may also be used. The body 14 may also be constructed to have a rough texture on the outer surface 16, such as ridges 74, bumps, or other surface features. In the example shown in FIG. 7, the outer surface 16 has a coiled appearance formed by a series of regular ridges 74.",
                        "In some other instances, one or more features 12 may be formed in the body 14 of the marker 10. As one example, one or more features 12 may be formed in the body 14 by microetching or other such fabrication techniques. As another example, one or more features 12 may be formed in the body 14 by adding micro air bubbles (or other gas-filled bubbles) into a substrate that forms the body 14. As still another example, one or more features 12 may be formed in the body 14 by leaching pores into the body 14 of the marker. For instance, features 12 may be formed by leaching on cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (\u201cPDMS\u201d).",
                        "The outer surface 16 of the marker 10 can be smooth, or in some other implementations can be textured. In some implementations, the outer surface 16 of the marker 10 can be coated with one or more coatings.",
                        "To facilitate imaging of the marker 10 with imaging modalities other than ultrasound (e.g., x-ray, CT, MRI) as may be done in the routine treatment process, the marker 10 can be doped with a suitable contrast agent. As one example, the marker 10 can be composed of a non-metallic material that is doped with an x-ray contrast agent, such as barium sulfate or another radiopaque contrast agent. As another example, the marker 10 can be composed of a non-metallic material that is doped with gadolinium, iron oxide, or another paramagnetic contrast agent used in magnetic resonance imaging. As still another example, the marker 10 can be doped with a dye, such as a visible dye to color the marker or a fluorescent dye or quantum dots that can be imaged. As still another example, the outer surface 16 of the marker 10 can be coated, partially or completely, with one or more coatings that will enhance the appearance of the marker 10 in another imaging modality, such as x-ray, CT, or MRI. For instance, the marker 10 can be at least partially coated with a coating that will enhance the MRI signal of the marker 10. As non-limiting examples, the coating could include silicone-based signaling compounds, saline, vitamin E, and iron-based compounds, such as Feraheme and/or ferumoxytol, which demonstrates T1 relaxation arid can be used in varying doses as contrast for mapping of superficial lymphatic vessels in patients with extremity lymphedema.",
                        "Additionally or alternatively, the marker 10 can be constructed to serve as the foundation for additional signaling or as a source of therapeutic agents.",
                        "In some implementations, the marker 10 can be constructed such that it can be anchored within a tissue. In this way, the marker 10 can be made to remain adjacent a marked lesion even when that lesion shrinks over time as a result of treatment delivered to the lesion region. That is, the marker 10 can be anchored to a tissue so as to prevent or otherwise minimize migration of the marker 10.",
                        "As one non-limiting example, a material that causes a local inflammatory reaction can be coupled to the marker 10 such that when the marker 10 is implanted it will be anchored in position via mild soft-tissue matting. For instance, a polypropylene mesh material, such as PROLENE\u00ae (Johnson & Johnson Corporation; New Brunswick, N.J., United States) can be coupled to the marker 10 to achieve this effect. Only a small amount of mesh material can be used to induce such a reaction. The mesh material can be coupled to a single side surface) of the marker 10, or more than one side (or surface) of the marker 10.",
                        "As another non-limiting example, polydimethylsiloxane (\u201cPDMS\u201d) can be used to reduce migration of the marker 10 when implanted. PDMS has a low chemical activity and is biologically inert, which is useful when it is used in implant devices. PDMS is made from a 3-component system involving a base, a curing agent, and a catalyst. The base is predominantly dimethylvinyl-terminated dimethylsiloxane. The curing agent is mostly composed of dimethylhydrogen siloxane. Both of these can be mixed with additives depending on the desired mechanical properties of the cured polymer. The third component is generally a metal-centered catalyst to promote crosslinking. For example, the metal-centered catalyst may be a platinum complex that promotes a hydrosilylation reaction between the methylhydrogen siloxane units in the curing agent and the terminal vinyl groups in the base siloxane.",
                        "An interesting property of cured PDMS is its ability of adhesion, hydrophobic properties, and low density compared to water and saline. In a semiaqueous environment (e.g., similar to human soft tissues), PDMS can make physical connections with solid surfaces. Based on these properties, the markers 10 can be coated on one or more surface with PDMS in order to achieve anchoring properties. In addition, PDMS exhibits ultrasound signaling features that are similar to free silicone; namely, a \u201csnowstorm\u201d appearance, which can be readily recognized during diagnostic ultrasound imaging. Based on this property, partially coating a marker 10 with PDMS can provide additional imaging characteristics.",
                        "One example marker 10 was constructed as follows. The marker 10 was laser cut from a PMMA wafer and then partially coated with PDMS mixture and cured for 4 hours at 65 degrees Celsius. The sonographic appearance of this marker 10 demonstrated the classic \u201csnowstorm appearance\u201d of silicone as well as the twinkling signature described in the present disclosure, as shown in FIG. 8. It is contemplated that such a dual signaling (silicone and twinkling) marker 10 will not only afford greater sonographic detectability, but will also create a means by which migration of the marker will be minimized. In some configurations, a small amount of PDMS can be added as a concentric ring around the marker 10, such that a different number of PDMS rings could be used as a way to distinguish two markers 10 in relative close proximity to each other.",
                        "Further, in some implementations a plurality of markers 10 can be agglomerated, connected by filaments, or otherwise coupled together.",
                        "In some constructions, the marker 10 can be constructed to have one or more portions that can be turned to a certain frequency, such that when insonated by an ultrasound probe at that frequency those portions of the marker 10 can be reliably detected.",
                        "The examples described above include markers that are composed of non-metallic materials that are specifically composed to generate twinkling artifacts. In other examples, standard or otherwise existing markers, implants, medical instruments, or devices (e.g., biopsy markers, biopsy clips, fiducials, localizers) can be coated in a similar non-metallic material that is composed to generate twinkling artifacts.",
                        "In other examples, radioactive seeds, such as those used for brachytherapy treatments, can be coated with a similar non-metallic material that is composed to generate twinkling artifacts, which can facilitate the localization and accurate placement of these radioactive seeds. In addition to providing brachytherapy treatment, radiation seeds (e.g., I-125 seeds) can be used in preoperative localization to help guide a surgeon in the operating room. Currently, radioactive I-125 seed placements are capped (e.g., at 2 or 3) because surgeons are unable to precisely resolve the positions of radioactive seeds in the operating room when there are too many radioactive seeds in close proximity to each other. Using radioactive seeds coated with the materials described in the present disclosure can overcome this problem by enabling better localization of individual seed placement, even when more than 2 or 3 seeds are used. Moreover, the materials described in the present disclosure can serve as the localizers themselves, thereby obviating the need for preoperative radioactive seed localization.",
                        "In some implementations, in addition to forming features 12 in the body 14 of the marker 10, microspheres may be embedded in the body 14 to further enhance the twinkling signature generated by the marker 10. As one example, the microspheres could be titanium microspheres or other metallic microspheres. As another example, the microspheres could be poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (\u201cPLGA\u201d) or other polymer or copolymer microspheres. In some embodiments, the marker 10 could be composed starting with such microspheres and forming the non-metallic substrate as a binder material.",
                        "Having described example markers, a method for using such markers is now described. Referring to FIG. 9, a flowchart is illustrated as setting forth the steps of an example method for detecting a non-metallic marker using ultrasound. The method includes inserting one or more markers into a tissue region within a subject, as indicated at step 902. The markers may be inserted via injection using a needle or via deployment using a coaxial needle and inner stylet. As noted above, the needle may be an 18-gauge needle in some implementations.",
                        "When the one or more markers are in place, ultrasound data are acquired from a region-of-interest containing the markers, as indicated at step 904. In general, the ultrasound data are Doppler ultrasound data, such as color Doppler, power Doppler, or spectral Doppler ultrasound data. The ultrasound data may include, for instance, images that depict the region-of-interest. Because of the material composition of the markers, twinkling artifacts will be present in these images. The location of the one or more markers can then be detected by analyzing the images in the ultrasound data, as indicated at step 906. For instance, the twinkling artifacts can point to the location of the marker that is generating the twinkling artifact, thereby enabling localization of the marker.",
                        "In some non-limiting examples, the locations of the one or more markers can be detected by inputting the ultrasound data to a suitably trained machine learning algorithm, generating output as feature data or a feature map indicating the location of the one or more markers. In these instances, the machine learning algorithm can be trained to detect the twinkling artifacts. For instance, the machine learning algorithm could be trained on training data that includes labeled ultrasound images that indicate the presence and location of twinkling artifacts. The machine learning algorithm may be an artificial neural network, such as a convolution neural network. In some implementations, the machine learning algorithm may implement deep learning. Using this suitably trained machine learning algorithm can enable automatic, real-time detection and localization of multiple different markers.",
                        "The locations of the markers can be recorded and stored for later use, as indicated at step 908. In some implementations, the locations of the markers can be stored and used to generate a display element that indicates the location or otherwise depicts of each marker. These display elements can then be generated on a display for a user to visualize the location of the markers within the imaged region-of-interest. In some other implementations, the locations of the markers can be stored and coregistered with other medical images (e.g., x-ray images, CT images, magnetic resonance images) in order to visualize the markers on those other medical images.",
                        "In still other implementations, the locations of the markers can be stored and converted into coordinate data for use with a surgical navigation system or a guided radiation therapy system. In this way, the coordinate data associated with the locations of the markers as determined from the ultrasound images of those markers can be used to guide accurate delivery of treatment to the subject.",
                        "The readily identifiable twinkling signature on color flow imaging associated with the markers described in the present disclosure can be translated into an apparent acoustic signature. For instance, the twinkling signature can be translated into an acoustic signature by using a pulsed Doppler gate, or by using other suitable image processing techniques to detect twinkling present in the color flow imaging region-of-interest (\u201cROI\u201d).",
                        "Advantageously, using this technique the twinkling signature's variability in time and space can be used to sensitively and specifically identify the marker and avoid false positive signals. In some implementations, the acoustic gate can also be modulated to explore various depths and detect the twinkling sound. Digital signal processing algorithms and techniques can also be implemented to reflect a continuous readout to the user of the distance from the probe to the twinkling source. This can enable the user to accurately locate the marker in real-time based on the acoustic feedback provided by the twinkling signature. In a similar fashion, haptic feedback can be generated and provided to the user to help indicate the location of the marker 10. The acoustic signature can be used as a broadband sound from the ultrasound machine or a tone could be used and the tone could be modulated in amplitude or repetition to indicate proximity of the ultrasound transducer to the marker.",
