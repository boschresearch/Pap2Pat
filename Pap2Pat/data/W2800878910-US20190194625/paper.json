    "title": "Human Cortex Spheroid with a Functional Blood Brain Barrier for High-Throughput Neurotoxicity Screening and Disease Modeling",
    "date": "2018-05-09",
    "abstract": "The integral selectivity characteristic of the blood brain barrier (BBB) limits therapeutic options for many neurologic diseases and disorders. Currently, very little is known about the mechanisms that govern the dynamic nature of the BBB. Recent reports have focused on the development and application of human brain organoids developed from neuro-progenitor cells. While these models provide an excellent platform to study the effects of disease and genetic aberrances on brain development, they may not model the microvasculature and BBB of the adult human cortex. To date, most in vitro BBB models utilize endothelial cells, pericytes and astrocytes. We report a 3D spheroid model of the BBB comprising all major cell types, including neurons, microglia and oligodendrocytes, to recapitulate more closely normal human brain tissue. Spheroids show expression of tight junctions, adherens junctions, adherens junction-associated proteins and cell specific markers. Functional assessment using MPTP, MPP+ and mercury chloride indicate charge selectivity through the barrier. Junctional protein distribution was altered under hypoxic conditions. Our spheroid model may have potential applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity testing.",

                "Over a million adults are annually diagnosed with brain diseases or disorders in the US alone1. The Alzheimer\u2019s Association reported that in 2016, the national cost for dementias was approximately $236 billion2. A major contributor to this high treatment cost is the late stage failure of promising drug candidates. Only 8% of central nervous system drug candidates that reach initial Phase 1 human safety testing eventually achieve regulatory approval due to either toxicity or ineffectiveness3. This estimate does not include the number of initially promising treatments pursued during pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies3. The shortage of effective therapies and low success rate of investigational drugs are in part due to the lack of human equivalent models4. Some current 2D systems may not accurately mimic human physiology because they do not possess the three dimensional organization of tissues, and often consist of cell lines, lacking physiologically relevant ratios of all cell types present in the organ5,6. More recently established 3D blood brain barrier (BBB) models have provided an understanding of size exclusion, selectivity and many other important aspects such as the expression of efflux and transport of proteins. Urich et al. reported the successful assembly of human primary astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells into a BBB\u2212 like model7. Cho et al. went on to characterize the BBB properties of a similar model8.",
                "The formation, maintenance and function of the BBB in the human neurovascular unit (NVU) depend on highly specific intercellular interactions within the human brain: specifically, the association between pericytes and blood vessels and how they regulate human brain endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration, differentiation, and vascular branching9. This signifies direct pericyte-endothelial interactions in the lumen and their crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB in the human neurovascular unit10,11. The interaction between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and the direct influence of astrocyte on the integrity of the BBB are also well documented12\u201315, There is a significant body of evidence, in both in vitro and in vivo systems, highlighting astrocyte interactions with the cerebral endothelium and the ways in which they help determine BBB function, morphology, and protein expression16\u201319. Microglia also play a critical role in BBB regulation and modulation of tight junction expression. They in turn have complex integrations in brain diseases such as epilepsy, ischemic stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders20. Furthermore, neurons are known to induce BBB related enzymes21. Therefore, the inclusion of the major human NVU cell types in an in vitro organoid model would be helpful in predicting human physiologic conditions.",
                "A natural progression from the currently established BBB models would be to define the effect of chemical agents on all the cell types that are critical to the normal function of a human NVU, including the microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons that are adjacent to the BBB, and to further understand the intercellular dynamics once molecules cross the barrier. Therefore, the development of a 3D in vitro system that contains all major cell types found in adult human brain cortex may provide a platform that can be used to understand the fundamental principles at play with the BBB, its function, and also to understand the effects of chemical substances that cross the BBB.",
                "Here we report the development of a human neurovascular unit organoid model that contains the six constituent cell types found within the brain cortex: human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), human pericytes (HBVP), human astrocytes (HA), human microglia (HM), human oligodendrocytes (HO) and human neurons (HN), with endothelial cells enclosing the brain parenchymal cells. Cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) sources (HM, HO, and HN) were utilized in several instances to establish potential patient-specific and disease applications. We validated the expression of tight junctions, adherens junctions and transport proteins, and showed that this model can be used in toxicity assessment studies for molecules that have the potential to cross or open the BBB. Neurotoxicity screening was assessed with the effects of mercury chloride, MPTP and MPP+. In addition, a model of the blood brain barrier during clinical ischemia was established showing physiologic responses under hypoxic conditions."

                        "Prior publications have shown the assembly of three cell types: primary human astrocytes, human pericytes, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells7. To demonstrate the assembly and cellular organization of organoids with four cell types, HBMECs, HPs, HAs, and human neuronal cells (HCN-2) were pre-treated with long-term cell labeling dye. The four cell types were placed into a mixture containing a ratio of 1:1:5:6, respectively. The cell mixture was placed in a hanging drop culture environment. After 96\u2009hrs of culture, assembled organoids were lowered and confocal microscopy images confirmed HBMEC and HBVP localization to the periphery of the organoid, with HA localized near the surface, and neuronal cells forming the core (Fig.\u00a01A). We evaluated the presence of a BBB in our organoid model by testing the expression of BBB tight junction protein ZO-1, which was identified with immunofluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy (Fig.\u00a01B).Figure 1Assessment of cell localization, tight junction protein expression, and barrier properties in self-assembled spheroids. Spheroids in (A) show self organisation of endothelial cells and pericytes to the outermost sphere whereas the astrocytes and neurons (violet) are encapsulated by the endothelial cells and pericytes. (B) Spheroids containing HBMEC, astrocytes, and pericytes were formed through self assembly. Shown is ZO-1, a tight junction protein that prevents free paracellular transport of molecules across the vascular-type barrier. Dapi (blue) shows nuclear staining. Also shown in the figure are empty pockets where there is no ZO-1, this indicates that the HBMECs are likely not completely covering the spheroid. (C) Permeability assessment was done through incubating the spheroids containing HBMEC, pericytes and astrocytes with FITC labeled IgG. The upper panel represents spheroids with an uncompromised vascular-type barrier (control) and the lower panel shows spheroids that were treated with histamine to transiently open the vascular-type barrier.

                        "We characterized the integrity and dynamic properties of the barrier formed in the organoids containing HBMEC, HBVP and HA by assessing FITC-labelled IgG permeability across the BBB. IgG permeability was first evaluated in untreated organoids. We then assessed IgG permeability in organoids pretreated with histamine. Histamine is a chemical agent known to transiently open the BBB22\u201324. Qualitative analysis through confocal microscopy showed higher FITC fluorescence at the core of treated organoids (Fig.\u00a01C) compared to untreated organoids (Fig.\u00a01C). This experiment shows that a type of vascular barrier was present. In order to specify BBB characteristics, we conducted further experiments using a small molecule as will be discussed below. A small amount of IgG was able to be visualized within the three cell-type organoid core in untreated organoids. The effects observed here could be attributed to incomplete coverage of endothelial cells."

The organoids maintained very high cell viability for up to 21 days in vitro (Fig.\u00a02A\u2013E). Cell viability, was uniform in all Z-stacked slices utilized in quantitative data presented. There were no apparent differences observed between the core and the outer surface as visualized through confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescent staining for the HBMEC marker CD31 to identify endothelial cell coverage in these assembled organoids showed that the endothelial cells localized to the outer surface of the organoid (Fig.\u00a02F). We identified the expression of tight junction proteins: ZO-1 and Claudin-5 (Fig.\u00a02G\u2013I). The endothelial cells, however, did not fully cover the outer surface of the organoids. This is shown with sections on organoids not staining for tight junction proteins ZO-1, and claudin-5, and CD31 (Fig.\u00a02F\u2013H). In order to increase endothelial coverage on the surface of the organoids, we utilized a staging method of organoid assembly. HBMVECs and HBVP were added 48\u2009hrs after forming organoids with the 4 cell types (HA, HM, HO, and HN), which allowed for a more cohesive coating of the organoid surface. This method is henceforth designated as the staged assembly method.Figure 2Six cell-type spheroid Characterization. Live-Dead Staining was conducted on days 5 (A), 7 (B), 10 (C), and 21 (D) to assess cell viability. Green represents live cells and red indicates dead cells; In each case, 8 randomly selected spheroids were assed for cell viability. (E) Green florescence for live cells was quantified and expressed as a percentage of the total fluorescence (red and green). Immunohistochemistry was conducted on spheroids to determine phenotypic protein expression. CD31 expression (F) shows localization of HBMEC in self-assembled spheroids. Even though the cells migrate to the outer sphere, the endothelial cells do not cover the spheroid. Expression of claudin-5 (G, red) was established through immunofluorescent staining. Expression of P-gp in G and Q (an efflux protein responsible for the efflux of xenobiotic substances out of the brain tissue) was established in self \u2013assembly and staged self-assembly spheroids, respectively. Self-assembly spheroids were stained for ZO-1 (H) and DAPI (blue). Selected area was imaged at higher magnification in order to visualize the cell border connections formed by ZO-1 (I). Specific cell markers were used to identify normal protein expression in individual cell type incorporated into the spheroid made through a staged self-assembly: (J) showing CD31 staining signifying that the HBMEC cover the spheroid in a staged self-assembly, PDGFR (K) an pericyte marker, GFAP (L) an astrocyte marker, Iba1 (M) a microglial marker, N O4 and MBP markers of oligodendrocyte progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes respectively. MAP2 (O) is a neuronal marker. Neuronal spheroids were stained for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (P) to identify the presence of dopaminergic neurons. Transmembrane glucose transporter and efflux transporter protein expression and localization were established by staining for P-gp (Q) and GLUT1 (R) respectively. All markers were found to have a thorough distribution. Images were obtained at 10x magnification. Scale bars are depicted in white. Scale bars, 200\u2009\u03bcm and 30\u2009\u03bcm (for L only)."

TH staining performed on neuronal spheroids may overstate the proportion of TH+ neurons in assembled organoids with all cell types. The proportion of TH+ neurons in organoids containing all cell types could be inferred from the MAP2 positive cells in 6 cell type organoid showing the presence of mature neurons. Together, these cells act in concert to enhance the function of the BBB, thereby maintaining brain homeostasis in humans29. Permeability \u2013glycoprotein (P-gp; Fig.\u00a02Q) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1; Fig.\u00a02R) are transport proteins that play major roles in the BBB. While, GLUT1 allows for glucose transport across the BBB30,31, P-gp prevents exogenous chemical substances from entering the brain parenchyma32. Furthermore, junctional complexes, mainly the tight and adherens junction proteins between HBMECs prevent paracellular diffusion of foreign substances into the brain tissue33\u201335. Through immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy, we identified the expression of major tight junction proteins ZO-1 (Fig.\u00a03A) and claudin-5 (Fig.\u00a03B). Adherens junction proteins such as VE-cadherin are anchored by associative protein \u03b2-catenin36.Figure 3Blood-brain barrier marker expression and effect of hypoxia on tight and adherens junction protein distribution. The presence of tight junction markers Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) (A), claudin-5 (B), and adherens junction proteins \u03b2-catenin (C) and VE-Cadherin (D) were confirmed via immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy at 10x.

Mark and Davis showed that hypoxia induces permeability and changes in the organization of tight junctions using a 2D transwell system44. Here, we report for the first time physiologic changes of junctional protein distribution in a multicellular 3D brain microvascular equivalent tissue organoid during pathological insult. In order to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the expression and distribution of tight junction proteins and adherens associated protein, organoids containing all 6 cell types were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 0.1% oxygen and 99.9% nitrogen for 24\u2009hr in an Xvivo System G300C (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY, USA).

Selenium depletion by mercury causes irreversible inhibition of the selenoenzymes that play a critical role in restoring Vitamin C, E and other anti-oxidant molecules back to their reduced forms45,46. Vitamin C and E are reducing agents and antioxidants that act as cofactors in reactions catalyzed by Cu+-dependent monooxygenases and Fe2+-dependent dioxygenases. Mostly, the production of reactive oxygen species is accentuated in brain cells because of the high rate of oxygen consumption in the brain47. These high amounts of reactive oxygen species inevitably make brain cells vulnerable to oxidative damage. Thus, brain cells heavily depend on the antioxidant protection provided by selenoenzymes. Brain cell dysfunction and death during prolonged or high mercury exposure is attributed to cellular selenium sequestration by mercury48. Selenium is needed for the biosynthesis of critical enzymes such as thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme that prevents and reverses oxidative damage45,46,48. Mercury I salts are less toxic than mercury II salts because they are less soluble. Mercury II salts do not cross the BBB despite their high solubility48. This makes mercury II salts ideal candidates for validating the charge selectivity function of the BBB in models.",

Organoids containing only neural cells did not have a BBB, while those containing all 6 cell types promoted the formation of a functional BBB, due in part to the presence of HBMEC, HBVP and HA cells. After completion of staged assembly, organoids were subsequently treated with mercury II chloride for 6 days. Mercury toxicity was evaluated by measuring cell viability through the assessment of ATP production following the CellTiter Luminescent Cell Viability Assay protocol (Promega, Madison, WI. USA). The results showed that BBB\u2212 organoids have significantly higher cell death (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared to BBB+ organoids (Fig.\u00a04B), demonstrating the low permeability of mercury ions through the BBB. It is worth noting that ATP production significantly increased in BBB+ spheroids treated with mercury II chloride. ATP is required by Na-K ATPase to establish the electrochemical gradient which generates the energy for chloride transport across the cell membrane49. This secondary active transport may induce cells to produce more ATP. In order to demonstrate that higher ATP production in BBB+ treated organoids was due to the presence of the BBB, we disrupted the BBB in BBB+ organoids with Histamine. ATP production was significantly lower (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) compared to untreated organoids as shown in Fig.\u00a04E.Figure 4BBB Integrity and selectivity using FITC labeled IgG, Mercury, MPTP and MPP+.

MPTP crosses the BBB due to its lipophilic properties; however, MPP+ is hydrophilic and does not cross the BBB51,54\u201356.

In order to establish BBB selectivity, we constructed BBB\u2212 organoids as well as BBB+ organoids using the staged assembly method. Upon transferring organoids to a long term culture plate on day 4, both the BBB\u2212 and BBB+ organoids were treated with MPTP and MPP+ for six days.

MPTP did not cause statistically significant cell death in treated compared with untreated BBB\u2212 organoids (student t-test, P\u2009=\u20090.13), as MPTP is not toxic to neurons (Fig.\u00a04B), but its metabolite MPP+ caused statistically significant (student t-test, P \\(<\\)  0.0001) cell death in BBB\u2212 organoids (C).

Put together, MPTB caused a reduction of BBB+ organoids compared to BBB\u2212 organoids because it traverses the BBB, while MPP+ did not cause lower ATP production in BBB+ organoids. However, MPP+ significantly reduced cell viability in BBB\u2212 organoids compared to BBB+ organoids.

Additional properties of the BBB can be elucidated by creating organoids with all the cell types present in the brain cortex, in proportions similar to normal tissue. The organoids can serve as a model for the evaluation of interactions between the BBB and adjacent brain tissue, and can provide a platform for understanding the combined capabilities of a novel drug to cross the BBB and its effect on microglia, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Such understanding may be important in designing potential in vitro models of neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and characterizing potential injury models, such as stroke.",
                "The organoid model containing 4 cell types that self-assemble in a manner in which the endothelial cells coat the sphere, and organoids containing 3 cell types that are prepared in a similar method appear to promote the formation of tight junction proteins. The results in organoids containing HBMEC, HA and HBVP show the presence of a functional barrier as demonstrated by low FITC-labeled IgG permeability to the core of the organoids. These organoids also showed a normal response when exposed to histamine, opening the barrier and allowing IgG to cross the barrier. Organoids containing 6 cell types maintained high cell viability for up to 21 days in vitro. This may be important in assessing the long-term effect in drug toxicity studies. We also identified expression of P-gp and GLUT1. These proteins play an important role to pump out unwanted chemical substances from the brain tissue and to transport glucose into the brain tissue, respectively. There are many diseases that are implicated in dysfunction and/or other abnormalities in these proteins50,60,61 and our 3D model, which mimics the physiological microenvironment, has the potential to be used to evaluate the expression, localization and function of these proteins upon genetic manipulations. We also demonstrated the expression of tight junctions, adherens junctions, and adherens junction-associated proteins; these have been identified to prevent the free paracellular diffusion of substances into the brain parenchyma.",
                "One of the areas that may be important in BBB in vitro models is the ability to apply these designs to model adult human disease. Specifically, over 80% of people hospitalized for stroke are adults62. Many current in vitro models do not accurately mimic adult human physiology. The use of human primary and iPSC derived cells could help narrow the gap towards attaining an ideal model for clinical applications in studies geared towards understanding adult human neurologic diseases. Our data show that hypoxia disrupts the localization of tight and adherens junction proteins, which indicates that our organoid model may be useful in studying ischemia in a physiologically relevant environment.",
                "To evaluate the selectivity of the BBB, we assessed the subsequent effect of mercury ions in the brain parenchyma by evaluating cell viability. Hg2+ does not cross the BBB because of its positive charge, which contributes to its hydrophilicity. Our data show that Hg2+ that forms when HgCl2 dissolves in media only causes significant cell death in neuronal organoids that did not have a BBB compared to organoids that possess a BBB. This indicates that the organoid model containing 6 cell type forms a functional BBB that is charge-selective. Similar results were observed when we used a small molecule pro-drug MPTP (a lipophilic small molecule), which is toxic when enzymatically converted into its metabolite MPP+ in glial cells. MPTP caused cell death or low ATP production in BBB+ organoids. However, when we exposed organoids containing 6 cell types directly to the non-BBB permeable MPP+, there was no significant cell death.",
                "The improvement reported herein warrants this model as a possible alternative to existing in vitro models. Further structural characterization to determine the production and proper deposition of extracellular matrix proteins of the BBB is needed. Analysis of effects on individual cell types in the model is also needed to understand cell specific functions which will make the model more applicable to specific applications or the study of various neurologic disorders.",
                "Taken together, the multicellular organoid model forms a functional BBB that is charge selective and shows relevant responses to physiologic conditional changes. This model may be useful not only in drug discovery for novel therapeutics, but also to evaluate the ability of such drug candidates to cross the BBB, and their ensuing sequelae such as general cytotoxicity, glial toxicity and neurotoxicity."
