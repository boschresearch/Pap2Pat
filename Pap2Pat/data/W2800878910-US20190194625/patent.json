                                "The BEE controls the barrier functions through a dynamic structure of tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ) formed mainly between endothelial cells. The capillary BBB is composed of the cell types of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), human brain microvascular pericytes (hBMPs), human astrocytes (hAs) and neurons. At the site of microvascular arterioles, human brain smooth muscle cells (hBSMCs) are also present. The organization of these cell types is termed the neurovascular unit (NVU). With the use of three-dimensional bioprinting, we seek to develop a standardized laboratory model of the human NYU with a functional blood brain barrier. This model would have applications in drug discovery and neurotoxicity testing. In addition, with the use of representative cell types derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), individualized, patient-specific blood brain barrier disease models may be feasible.",
                                "Four three-dimensional bioprinted NVU Conga/CIS were designed: 1) Cortical tissue with mature neurons and optionally oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and/or microglia; 2) capillary NVU containing 3 cell types (hBMECs), hBMPs, and hAs; 3) micro-arteriole NVU containing the 3 prier cell types with the addition of hBSMCs, and 4) cortical NYU containing neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, pericytes, and brain microvascular endothelial cells. Primary human cells or induced pluripotent stem cell derived cells were utilized in the models. Each cell type was expanded in 2D culture in preparation for 3D bioprinting. Cells used were between passages 4-11.",
                                "For the cortical tissue unit, 20 million RenCell VM cells (human neural progenitor cells) were reconstituted in fibrin hydrogel and subsequently bioprinted into a silicon mold. For the capillary NVU construct (FIG. 4A), 20 million hAs were integrated into fibrin gel in preparation for microextrusion bioprinting, hBMPs and hBMECs were integrated into gelatin as a sacrificial layer for lumen formation. For the micro-arteriole NVU construct (FIG. 4B), 20 million hAs were integrated into fibrin gel with hBMPs and hBSMCs integrated together into a separate gel. hBMECs were integrated into the gelatin sacrificial layer. Structures were maintained in static culture with endothelial growth media (EGM2, Lonza) exchanged every other day. Printed constructs were fixed at different time points and stained for Beta III tubulin, CD31 and GFAP. On. Day 4 and 7, structures were processed for H&E staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed for the astrocyte marker GFAP and endothelial cell marker CD31. Viability of the printed structure was assessed on Day 10 by way of 2 \u03bcM Calcein AM and 4 \u03bcM EthD-1 solution.",
                                "The structures were processed for H&E staining to reveal that they maintained a defined lumen on Day 4 in static culture with cell growth into the lumen on Day 7 (FIG. 6). Immunofluorescence was performed for neuronal differentiation marker, Beta III tubulin, the astrocyte marker GFAP and endothelial cell marker CD31 revealed defined cellular layers on Day 4. Viability assessment on Day 10 revealed over 90% cell viability.",
                                "The bioprinted NVU constructs reveal cellular layering with a defined lumen present on Day 4. (FIG. 7) immunohistochemistry for endothelial cells and astrocytes show that these cell types are in the expected location on Day 4. Viability assay show high cell viability of the bioprinted cells within the structure, maintained at Day 4. (FIG. 6)",
