Besides, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, prior to the step of sequencing the genome sample, the method of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample may further comprise a step of extracting the genome sample from a biological sample. Accordingly, the biological sample may be directly used as raw material, for obtaining information regarding whether the biological sample has copy number variation, so as to reflect health status of organisms. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the used biological sample is not subjected to special restrictions. According to some specific examples of the present disclosure, the biological sample is any one selected from a group consisting of blood, urine, saliva, tissue, germ cells, oosperm, blastomere and embryo. It would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that different biological samples may be used for analyzing different diseases. Accordingly, these samples may be conveniently obtained from organisms, and different samples may be used specifically directing to certain diseases, so as to selecting specific means for analyzing the certain diseases. For example, for a subject possibly suffering a certain cancer, a sample may be collected from cancerous tissue or juxtacancerous tissue, from which cells are further isolated for analysis, accordingly, whether such tissue become cancerous may be accurately determined as early as possible. According a specific example of the present disclosure, a single cell may be used as the biological sample. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, methods and devices of isolating a single cell from a biological sample are not subjected to special restrictions. According to some specific examples of the present disclosure, a single cell may be isolated from a biological sample using at least one of dilution, mouth-controlled pipette, micromanipulation (micro-dissection is preferred), flow cytometry isolation, microfluidics. Accordingly, a single cell may be effectively and conveniently obtained from a biological sample, to implement subsequent steps. Then, efficiency of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample may be further improved.",
                        "Besides, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, methods of sequencing the genome sample are not subjected to special restrictions. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the step of sequencing the genome sample further comprises following sub-steps of: firstly amplifying the genome sample, to obtain an amplified genome sample; secondly, constructing a sequencing-library with the amplified genome sample; finally sequencing the constructed sequencing-library, to obtain the sequencing result consisting of a plurality of reads. Accordingly, whole genome information of the sequencing result of the genome sample may be effectively obtained, and a single cell genome or a trace of nucleic acid sample may be subjected to effective sequencing, which may further improve efficiency of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample. Those skilled in the art may choose different methods of constructing a sequencing-library in accordance with specific solutions used in genome sequencing techniques. A detailed process of constructing a genome sequencing-library may refer to a specification provided by sequencing-instrument manufacturer, such as Illumina Company, for example Multiplexing Sample Preparation Guide (Part#1005063; February 2010), which is incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "Optionally, for the step of extracting the genome sample from the biological sample when being a single cell, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, the method may further comprise a step of lysing the single cell, to release whole genome of the single cell. According to some examples of the present disclosure, methods of lysing the single cell to release whole genome are not subjected to special restrictions, as long as the single cell is lysed, preferably the single cell is fully lysed. According to specific examples of the present disclosure, the single cell is lysed using an alkaline lysate, to release whole genome of the single cell. Inventors of the present disclosure find out that the step of lysing the single cell may effectively lyse the single cell to release whole genome, and accuracy may be improved when subjecting the released whole genome to sequencing, which may further improve efficiency of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, methods of amplifying a single cell whole genome are not subjected to special restrictions, a PCR-based method may be used, for example PEP-PCR, DOP-PCR and OmniPlex WGA; a non-PCR-based method may be also used, for example Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA).

A commercial kit, including but not limited to GenomePlex from Sigma Aldrich, PicoPlex from Rubicon Genomics, REPLI-g from Qiagen, illustra GenomiPhi from GE Healthcare and etc, may be used. According to specific examples of the present disclosure, prior to the sub-step of constructing a sequencing-library, the single cell whole genome may be amplified by OmniPlex WGA. Accordingly, the whole genome may be effectively amplified, which may further improve efficiency of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, the sub-step of sequencing the whole genome sequencing-library is performed by at least one selected from Next-Generation sequencing technology consisting of Hiseq system of Illumina Company, Miseq system of Illumina Company, Genome Analyzer (GA) system of Illumina Company, 454 FLX of Roche Company, SOLiD system of Applied Biosystems Company, Ion Torrent system of Life Technologie Company. Accordingly, characteristics of high-throughput and deep sequencing of these sequencing apparatus may be used, which further improves efficiency of determining whether copy number variation presents in a genome sample. Obviously, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other sequencing methods and apparatuses may also be used for whole genome sequencing, for example Third-Generation sequencing technology (i.e., single molecule sequencing technology) such as any one of HeliScope system from Helicos BioSciences Company, RS system from PacBio Company and etc, as well as more advanced sequencing technology which may be developed later. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, lengths of sequencing data obtained by whole genome sequencing are not subjected to special restrictions. According to an specific example of the present disclosure, the plurality of sequencing data have an average length of about 50 bp. The inventors of the present disclosure surprisingly find out that sequencing data having a length of about 50 bp may greatly facilitate subjecting the sequencing data to analyzing, which improves analysis efficiency and significantly reduces cost for analysis, by which further improves efficiency of determining chromosome aneuploidy of a single cell and reduces cost of determining chromosome aneuploidy of a single cell. Term of \u201caverage length\u201d used herein refers to a mean value of length values of every sequencing data.",

As reads derive from the genome sample, when a certain region presents copy number variation in the genome sample, the number of the reads corresponded in the region also changes significantly. Accordingly, after determining a plurality of breakpoints, copy number variation probably presents in a region between two successive breakpoints may be preliminary determined.",
