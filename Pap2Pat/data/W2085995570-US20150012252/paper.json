    "title": "A Single Cell Level Based Method for Copy Number Variation Analysis by Low Coverage Massively Parallel Sequencing",
    "date": "2013-01-23",
    "abstract": "Copy number variations (CNVs), a common genomic mutation associated with various diseases, are important in research and clinical applications. Whole genome amplification (WGA) and massively parallel sequencing have been applied to single cell CNVs analysis, which provides new insight for the fields of biology and medicine. However, the WGA-induced bias significantly limits sensitivity and specificity for CNVs detection. Addressing these limitations, we developed a practical bioinformatic methodology for CNVs detection at the single cell level using low coverage massively parallel sequencing. This method consists of GC correction for WGA-induced bias removal, binary segmentation algorithm for locating CNVs breakpoints, and dynamic threshold determination for final signals filtering. Afterwards, we evaluated our method with seven test samples using low coverage sequencing (4\u223c9.5%). Four single-cell samples from peripheral blood, whose karyotypes were confirmed by whole genome sequencing analysis, were acquired. Three other test samples derived from blastocysts whose karyotypes were confirmed by SNP-array analysis were also recruited. The detection results for CNVs of larger than 1 Mb were highly consistent with confirmed results reaching 99.63% sensitivity and 97.71% specificity at base-pair level. Our study demonstrates the potential to overcome WGA-bias and to detect CNVs (>1 Mb) at the single cell level through low coverage massively parallel sequencing. It highlights the potential for CNVs research on single cells or limited DNA samples and may prove as a promising tool for research and clinical applications, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/screening, fetal nucleated red blood cells research and cancer heterogeneity analysis.",

                "Copy number variations (CNVs) are known to be associated with various diseases, such as 22q11.2 deletion/duplication syndrome [1], [2], [3], Cri-du-Chat (5p deletion) [4] and even cancers [5]. Rather than cell-population research, single cell analysis provides insights into research of disease aetiology and diagnosis. It is especially useful for cancer heterogeneity research, since it has been shown to detect a single-nucleotide mutation that could result in a kidney tumor [6]. It is also useful for conducting evolution research since it has proven that CNVs plays an important role on cell evolution [7], [8]. In addition, for the clinical purposes, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis/screening (PGD/PGS) was used for disease scanning since 1990s [9], [10], [11]. This application allows CNVs analysis of single cell isolated from polar body, blastomere or blastocyst. Single-cell analysis may also open up new opportunities for noninvasive prenatal genetic diagnosis by only needing a single fetal nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) [12], [13].",
                "Whole genome amplification (WGA) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology have been widely used in CNVs analysis of single cells [14], [15]. aCGH technology is based on the differential labels of test sample and reference DNA with fluorophores. These samples are then hybridized to array containing oligonucleotide probes and subsequently analyzed for fluorometric signal ratios, which allows for the calling of the copy number profile of discrete genomic intervals. However, there are several limitations of WGA-based aCGH. WGA-induced biases have been observed in previous studies [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and can hinder the sensitivity and specificity of CNV detection, since it has been associated with sequence repeats, proximity to chromosome ends [18], [19], [20] and GC content [18], [20]. In the procedure of WGA, GC content, in particular, can influence polymerase processivity and DNA priming so as to lead to false CNVs signal. This can be caused by over-amplification or under-amplification on GC-poor or GC-rich regions [18], [20]. Nowadays, massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has become an advanced approach for genomics research [21]. The power of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in profiling genome copy number landscapes makes it notably more advantageous over aCGH, as reported in previous studies [22], [23].",
                "In this study, we developed a WGA-induced bias correction strategy based on GC bias description using two single cells isolated from the peripheral blood (PB) of YH, a healthy Chinese individual with a normal karyotype. We then established a practical bioinformatics pipeline, which detected CNVs at the single cell level through low coverage whole genome sequencing. GC correction to lessen WGA-induced bias, a binary segmentation algorithm for CNVs breakpoint location, and dynamic threshold determination for final CNV signals filtering constituted the core of this pipeline. Seven single cells isolated from PB or blastocysts with confirmed CNV results were recruited to examine the performance of this pipeline. Our method explores CNVs in single cells or limited DNA, which provides a practical approach for CNVs detection in the clinic."

                        "In order to observe and correct GC biases in WGA, we isolated, amplified, and sequenced two single cells from the PB of YH, a healthy Chinese individual with normal karyotype [24], generating an average of 13.04 million single-end (SE) 50 bp reads of each cell (Table 1).We defined the quotient between the reads number of each observation window and the average reads number as relative read number (RRN), which ideally would be equal to one in diploid genome. By comparing the GC content and RRN, we discovered that the RRN tended to be less than average in genomic GC-poor (<40%) and GC-enriched (>48%) regions (Figure 1A), implying significant amplification bias of these regions.",
                        "Based on this discovery, we developed a weighted correction strategy to remove the GC bias. RRN would be adjusted by a GC-related weighting coefficient, calculated using RRN in windows that shared same GC content (Methods and materials). After re-normalization, the corrected relative reads number (CRN) showed a much better uniformity of GC content, indicating a high efficacy of the correction (Figure 1B). Also, the self-defined GC-bias index proved that more than 99.90% of the GC biases were removed by our strategy. (Materials and Methods, Table S1)",
                        "After GC bias correction, we employed a binary segmentation algorithm to access higher accuracy of the localization of the CNVs breakpoints on the chromosome. Candidate breakpoints were obtained after initialization and the adjacent windows were merged to localize the optimized breakpoints. Considering the influence of different GC content on CNVs detection, we developed a dynamic threshold determination algorithm for the final signal filtering, which would improve the general sensitivity and specificity of CNVs detection. Finally, we established a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline (Figure 2), which included sequencing reads alignment, GC bias correction, a binary segmentation algorithm and dynamic threshold determination for signals filtering."

These karyotypes were normal, had CNVs, or had aneuploidies. An average of about 10.92 million SE 50 bp reads were obtained for each single-cell samples and mapped to the human reference genome (HG18, NCBI Build36) using SOAP2 [25] (Table 1). The coverage of those sequencing reads in the genome ranged from 4.0% to 9.5%. All these single cell samples had received CNV analysis using the standard pipeline described above (Figure 2), and were used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the method.",
                        "In total, six out of seven test single cell samples were identified with CNVs over 1 Mb or aneuploidies, including seven events of CNVs from five samples and three events of aneuploidies from two samples. Generally, the CNV results detected by our method were highly consistent with confirmed CNV results (Table 2). For the single-cell samples from PB or blastocysts, we successfully detected the CNVs and aneuploidies using our method (Figure 3 & Table 2). Especially, two smaller CNVs were also identified correctly in samples SC 6 and SC 7 (Figure 4 & Table 2). The two CNVs were a duplication of 3.94 Mb on chromosome 20 and a duplication of 5.47 Mb on chromosome 1. It indicates our method can identify CNVs (>1 Mb) correctly and the detection results can reach 99.63% sensitivity and 97.71% specificity (Table 3).",
                        "To further estimate the sensitivity and specificity of our method for CNVs detection on call level, we performed simulation in silico to depict the relationship between CNVs size and its performance (Materials and Methods). We first simulated CNVs, ranging from 500 kb to 5 Mb, on YH genome. Then, we applied our method to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of our method. Overall, the sensitivity increased with the CNV size, and achieved about 94% for CNV over 3 Mb could be detected successfully (Figure 5). Also our method showed a high efficiency on decreasing the false positive rate, for example, the specificity of 750 kb CNV was as high as 95% (Figure 5). Additionally, we also studied our ability to map breakpoints accurately by this simulation. For this purpose, we calculated the minimum distance between the segmentation algorithm (using about 10M simulated reads) predicted breakpoint and the real breakpoint. The CNVs breakpoint precision analysis indicated that we could localize the CNV breakpoints within about 70 kb (median), which was associated with the size of observation windows."

Different strategies were conducted to reduce the significant influence of bias from WGA or sequencing procedure in both methods. We removed GC bias by a weighted strategy between observation (sequencing data) and expectation (the average). To contrast, SegSeq used a comparative genomic strategy to decrease the experimental variance between the case and control, which is similar to the principle of array-CGH. Another difference between two methods was the threshold determination for final signals filtering, which is dynamic in our method and fixed in SegSeq (Table 3).",
                        "We employed SegSeq to detect the CNVs in the seven test samples with suggested parameters (-W 400 \u2013a 1000 \u2013b 10), using the YH samples (YH-1 and YH-2) as control. A total of 16 CNVs events were identified in seven samples, and also three additional aneuploidies in two samples (Table 2). Almost all CNVs over 1 Mb were correctly detected in both methods, corresponding 99.63% and 92.75% of sensitivity for our method and SegSeq, respectively. However, the specificity for SegSeq was only 16.49% on CNVs larger than 1 Mb, which was far less than 97.71% of our method (Table 3). Most of the false positive signals of SegSeq were common in GC-poor chromosomes (such as chromosome 13) and GC-rich chromosomes (such as chromosome 19) (Figure S1), which simply could not be filtered by a fixed threshold. These signals could be explained by the significant GC bias in WGA described above. Moreover, in the case of single cells with smaller CNVs (Figure 4), our method showed a higher specificity for CNV detection than SegSeq. For example, on chromosome 1 of SC 7, a duplication of about 3 Mb on the cytogenetic band of p36 (24,736,617\u201327,719,432) was detected by SegSeq, but verified as a false signal (Figure 4B).",
                        "In brief, our method based on a weighted strategy had more efficient than the comparative genomics strategy to analyze CNVs using WGA data, only for detection of CNVs over 1 Mb."

                "However, several improvements are still necessary for further studies. Firstly, our method shows a high false negative rate (FNR) on smaller CNVs (<1 Mb) (Figure 5). Also, the simulation results indicated that our sensitivity on smaller CNVs was strongly related to the number of observation windows (Figure S2). Using smaller observation windows could increase the sensitivity and improve the resolution of our method. In addition, false positive signal in smaller observation windows could be caused by the lack of data from low coverage of whole genome sequencing. Therefore, it is important for appropriate observation windows selection according to data production and the sensitivity and resolution of our method can also be improved by increasing the sequencing reads or target sequencing [27] using smaller observation windows. Secondly, except GC content, several factors, including chromosomal structure, repeat regions [18], [19], [20] etc., can also induce WGA-bias. Ideally, these biases would mostly relate to specific regions in human genome. Therefore, a population-scale normalization strategy, comparing the same observation window with data generated from the same batch, will be powerful for WGA-induced bias removal.",
                "Our method can be utilized for research on somatic CNVs to explore cell evolution in cancers. Furthermore, it provides a potential solution for CNVs detection in clinical applications of single cell technology, such as PGD/PGS, using fetal nucleated red blood cell for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis [12], [13], or using PB for identifying circulating tumor cells for fast and convenient noninvasive cancer screening [28]. To meet these clinical needs, more samples are necessary to improve the sensitivity and specificity of our method. In conclusion, our method for CNVs detection using WGA and MPS data highlights that CNVs research at the single cell level and explores a potential solution for single cell applications in clinic."

First, the average size of the windows was determined by considering the GC content that is characteristic of the human reference genome and our low coverage sequencing strategy. Since it had been reported that long DNA segments (>300 kb) have relatively homogeneous GC content [30], the average size should be less than 300 kb to access vivid GC content distribution for observation or correction. However, the low coverage sequencing strategy (about 10 million reads per sample) would lay more uncertain influence in smaller genomic regions. Therefore, we decided to divide the human genome into non-overlapping observation windows with an average size of about 150 kb. Second, after considering uniqueness, we performed a simulation to obtain the dynamic observation windows. We divided the reference genome (HG18, Build 36) into sliding SE50 simulated reads and mapped them to the genome with a maximum of two mismatches and reserved unique mapped reads. When constructing these windows, we allowed the windows to share the same simulated reads numbers instead of the same window size to achieve higher comparability of suitable expected sequencing reads number among windows.

We first filtered the N regions on YH genome. Then we randomly selected regions as candidate regions for further CNV simulation. To mimic the influence of YH \u201ctrue CNVs\u201d in further simulation, we analyzed these candidate regions using WGS data of YH PB with SegSeq and excluded those regions overlapped with \u201ctrue CNVs\u201d on YH genome. The remained candidate regions would be used to CNVs simulation. (II) CNV simulation. We then randomly simulated CNVs ranging from 500 kb to 5 Mb based the candidate regions above on YH-1 and YH-2. We simulated totally 100 CNVs for each size. Under the consideration of sequence volume, we extract 10M sequence reads from YH-1 and YH-2 respectively. RRNs on selected regions would multiply by 0.5 (deletion) or 1.5 (duplication) directly. Standard GC correction, binary segmentation and dynamic threshold determination were performed to detect these simulated CNVs. (III) Sensitivity/specificity statistics and breakpoint precision analysis. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated by the following formula:where , ,  represent the number of simulated CNVs (100), true signals of CNVs and false signals of CNVs, respectively. Also, we calculated the minimum distance between the predicted and simulated CNV breakpoints to reveal the breakpoint precision of our method."
