In particular, the present disclosure provides alphavirus replicon particle (ARP) preparations, especially VEE particles expressing a melanoma antigen (in particular TRP2), for use in human and veterinary medicine and for enhancing or inducing the immune system's response to this antigen so that the incidence, metastasis and/or severity of melanoma is reduced.",

                        "The Alphavirus genus includes a variety of viruses, all of which are members of the Togaviridae family. The alphaviruses include Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEE), Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEE), Everglades Virus, Mucambo Virus, Pixuna Virus, Western Equine Encephalitis Virus (WEE), Sindbis Virus, Semliki Forest Virus, among others. The viral genome is a single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA, modified at the 5\u2032-end with a methylated cap and at the 3\u2032-end with a variable-length poly (A) tract. Structural subunits containing a single viral protein, capsid, associate with the RNA genome in an icosahedral nucleocapsid. In the virion, the capsid is surrounded by a lipid envelope covered with a regular array of transmembrane protein spikes, each of which consists of a heterodimeric complex of two glycoproteins, E1 and E2. See Pedersen et al., J. Virol 14:40 (1974). The Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses are considered the prototypical alphaviruses and have been studied extensively. See Schlesinger, The Togaviridae and Flaviviridae, Plenum Publishing Corp., New York (1986). The VEE virus has been studied extensively, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,440.",
                        "The studies of these viruses have led to the development of techniques for vaccinating against the alphavirus diseases and against other diseases through the use of alphavirus vectors for the introduction of foreign genes.

In the present methods and compositions, the TRP2 is desirably, but not necessarily, identical in species source to that of the subject to whom the composition is administered. In specific embodiments, the mouse TRP2 has the amino acid sequence as set for in Table 1b and an exemplary human TRP2 has the amino acid sequence as set forth herein below. Additional coding sequences are given in herein below, and further sequences are known to the art.",

The composition can be administered to the subject in any manner consistent with administration of immunogenic compositions, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intradermal, intranasal, intravaginal, intrarectal, subcutaneous or intravenous, especially via the subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of administration. In certain situations, especially for treatment of prevention of metastatic melanoma, intravenous administration could be used. In an animal subject, footpad injection is another route of administration for the present compositions. In these methods, the administration is desirably repeated, although subsequent dosages of the TRP2 may be via DNA vaccine or recombinant protein as well as, or in addition to, the alphavirus replicon particles which express TRP2, and any of the TRP2 administrations may be allogeneic or syngeneic with respect to the TRP2 source and the subject.",

                        "There is a need in the art for cost-effective, potent and efficacious pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of a devastating cancer such as melanoma and/or for reducing the incidence, metastasis and/or severity of a cancer such as melanoma and for increasing survival time after onset of melanoma. Provided herein is an RNA replicon vector system derived from an attenuated alphavirus engineered to produce single-cycle, propagation-defective virus-like alphavirus replicon particle (ARP) containing a self-replicating RNA (replicon) expressing the melanoma antigen dopachrome tautomerase (DCT, also known as TRP2). When inoculated into humans and/or animals, these ARP compositions significantly enhance or induce the humoral and cellular immune responses to melanoma cells, metastatic melanoma cells and tumors. It is particularly important to generate a rapid and strong response to the melanoma cells and tumors in order to increase survival time after diagnosis, delay recurrence, reduce the severity of the cancer and its effects, and/or reduce the intensity and occurrence of this cancer and its effects, which is notoriously difficult to treat, especially if advanced. Additionally, administration of such compositions to subjects not yet having melanoma, e.g., those subjects that may be at high risk for developing melanoma, prevents or reduces the incidence and/or severity of melanoma.",
                        "Immunization protocols can have repeated administrations or single administrations, and a second or subsequent dose can be of a different species of TRP2 and or it can comprise a different modality or an additional modality as the initial VRP-TRP2 dosage. Subsequent doses can also be of a different amount, either more or less, than the initial dose administered.",
                        "Melanocyte differentiation antigens are attractive candidates for melanoma immunotherapy, but because they are expressed by malignant cells as well as their normal counterpart eliciting effective immune responses is challenging.",
                        "The use of an alphavirus replicon vector system as an immunotherapy to prevent or treat melanoma and other TRP2-expressing cancers is described herein. Use of propagation-defective virus-like replicon particles (VRP) based on an attenuated strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus is especially attractive because VRP express heterologous proteins to high levels and target expression to dendritic cells. VRP vaccines have been shown to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses to the vectored gene products in many animal disease models and in phase I/II clinical trials.",
                        "The immunogenic protein can be a full-length dopachrome tautomerase (DCT, TRP2) TRP2 protein or an immunogenic fragment thereof. In the alphavirus replicon particle nucleic acid, the TRP2 can be from the same species as that to which the immunogenic composition comprising the alphavirus replicon particles is administered (syngeneic administration) or it can be from a different species (allogeneic administration). A TRP2 protein which varies in sequence from that of the subject but which is derived from the same species as the subject can also be expressed by the VRP composition.",
                        "The efficacies of VEE VRP compositions expressing the melanocyte differentiation antigens tyrosinase, gp100 or TRP-2 were analyzed against challenge with cells of the poorly immunogenic and highly aggressive B16 murine melanoma. TRP-2-expressing VRP were the most effective in delaying tumor occurrence when compared to the other antigens tested. Although both TRP2-specific CD8+ T cells and TRP2-specific IgG are induced, the data suggest that B-cells may play a more important role in the effector phase of tumor protection, at least in the prophylactic approach. These studies demonstrate that VRP vaccines present a useful approach for melanoma immunotherapy and prophylaxis.",
                        "One aspect of the methods and compositions provided herein is the surprising ability of TRP2 immune response to the melanoma cells, with the result that in the B16 mouse models, there is significant tumor regression and prolonged survival in mice treated after tumor development and postponed or no tumor development in mice challenged with the B16 melanoma cells after vaccination with the TRP2-expressing ARPs. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the administration of the TRP2-expressing ARPs enhanced the magnitude of the humoral, or antibody, responses to the melanoma cells as well as the T cell response to those cells. Similar benefit is achieved in humans suffering from melanoma or in humans where protection against melanoma is desired.",
                        "The role for the induction of humoral responses by TRP2-expressing ARPs is supported by the observation that sera from mice immunized with TRP2-expressing ARP delayed tumor growth as compared to sera from mice immunized with ARPs expressing other antigens. The induction of TRP-2 specific IgG is dependent on MHC II, and the anti-tumor effect involves signaling through activating Fc receptors.",
                        "Immunization with TRP2-expressing ARPs induced a stronger CD8+ T-cell response against the TRP-2181 immunodominant epitope as compared to the response elicted by VRPs expressing other melanocyte differentiation antigens. Additionally, immunization with TRP-2-expressing ARPs significantly increased the percentage of infiltrating CD45+ immune cells in the infiltrate of tumors implanted after vaccination, and the quality of the CD45+ response was changed, since the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T cells recruited at the tumor site was significantly enhanced, indicating that the B16 tumor cell-reactive CD8+ T cells were trafficking to the tumor in vivo.",
                        "Such a synergistic activation of both IgGs and CD8+ T cell effector mechanisms supports the particular efficacy of TRP-2 expressing ARPs.",
                        "It is understood that the immunization approach described herein can be combined with surgery and/or chemotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of a diagnosed melanoma.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the present methods are practiced as part of a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy, in which the \u201cpriming\u201d immunization, comprising the initial administration of one or more antigens to an animal, especially a human patient, in one form (or \u201cmodality\u201d) in preparation for subsequent administration(s) (often referred to as \u201cboosting\u201d) of the same antigen in a different form, or modality. Specifically, the term \u201cpriming\u201d, or alternatively \u201cinitiating\u201d or \u201cactivating\u201d an immune response or \u201cenhancing\u201d and \u201cpotentiating\u201d, defines a first immunization delivering an antigen which induces an immune response to the desired antigen and recalls a higher level of immune response to the desired antigen upon subsequent re-immunization with the same antigen when administered in the context of a different vaccine delivery system (i.e. form or modality). The forms of antigen to be administered can comprise alphavirus vectors, immunogens derived from cultured or other melanoma cells or of the relevant tumor, for example from the subject if it is a melanoma sufferer, recombinant TRP2 protein, synthetic peptides comprising at least one epitope of TRP2, live, attenuated or killed organisms or extracts where the TRP2 antigen is expressed, naked nucleic acids, nucleic acids formulated with lipid-containing moieties, pox vectors, adenoviral vectors, herpesvirus vectors, flavivirus vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus vectors, paramyxoviral vectors, parvovirus vectors, papovavirus vectors, and retroviral vectors, where a nucleic acid or vector expresses the TRP2 antigen in cells of the subject into which it is administered. The viral vectors can be virus-like particles or viral nucleic acids capable of expressing the TRP2 antigen. In the methods described herein, the priming step is the administration of a composition that comprises the TRP2-expressing ARP. Following the priming immunization a \u201cboosting immunization\u201d, or a \u201cboost\u201d, is administered, a composition delivering the same antigen as encoded in the priming immunization. The boost is sometimes referred to as an anamnestic response, i.e., an immune response in a previously sensitized animal. Multiple boosts can be administered, utilizing different or the same amounts for each boost. Adjuvants and/or cytokines can be administered together with the immunogenic composition.",
                        "Illustrating the need for improvements in prophylaxis and/or treatment of melanoma, over 60,000 Americans are diagnosed with melanoma every year, and this disease causes over 8000 deaths per year (National Cancer Institute, 2008). Melanoma is an especially serious disease, especially if not detected and treated early in the progression of the disease, at least in part because untreated melanoma often metastasizes aggressively. In addition, melanoma often does not respond well to chemotherapeutic regimens.",
                        "ARP expressing TRP2 serve as useful immunogens in treatment and/or vaccination regimens to reduce incidence of melanoma and/or to ameliorate subject clinical status or slow the melanoma disease process. In order to determine if ARPs designed to express TRP2 could serve as functional immune-enhancing delivery agents, the coding sequence encoding TRP2 was cloned into the ARP replicon DNA plasmid, and the transcribed RNAs were packaged into VRPs. The procedures used herein for making TRP2-expressing VRP, which are based on a replicon-helper system, are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,078,218, 7,045,335, 7,425,337, 7,442,381 and U.S. Published Application 2009-0075384. Mice were immunized with immunogenic compositions containing VRPs which express the TRP2 melanoma antigen. Mice were then monitored for humoral responses to the antigen, and cellular responses were measured in spleens obtained by necropsy performed at the end of the studies. Surprisingly, VRP expressing TRP2 were particularly potent in inducing not only cellular but also humoral responses active against the melanoma tumor cells. No additional antigen type or antibody appeared to be required to generate a beneficial effect in this mouse melanoma model for human disease.",
                        "In general, VRP vaccines direct the expression of the gene of interest to the draining lymph node, which also is the site where antigen presentation to na\u00efve T cells occurs. Prior PCR experiments with VRPS expressing a protein of interest have shown that VRP expression of the gene of interest continues for a few days until the expressing cell succumbs. While soluble protein rapidly disappears by degradation as well as diffusion. VRP-mediated expression, on the other hand, is transient and since there is no DNA stage in the alphavirus replicon cycle, there is no risk of integration.",
                        "The optimal dose for a given subject and a given disease target is easily determined based on the teachings herein. A range of ARPs expressing TRP2, in a dosage range from 104 to 1011, optionally 107 to 1010, especially 107, 5\u00d7107, 108, 5\u00d7108, 109, 5\u00d7109 or 1010, can be tested. The optimal dose for enhancing cellular responses may not always be the optimal dose for enhancing humoral responses; if both responses are desired, it may be advantageous to test several concentrations of TRP2-ARPs within the range given to determine the optimal overall immune response.",
                        "The following discussion is provided to improve the understanding of the present disclosure by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art.",

The expression \u201cE2 amino acid (e.g., Lys, Thr, etc.) number\u201d indicates designated amino acid at the designated residue of the E2 protein, and is also used to refer to amino acids at specific residues in the E3 or E1 proteins.

These are sometimes referred to as the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, or alphavirus 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequences. The use of these 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends results in replication of the RNA sequence encoded between the two ends. The 3\u2032 alphavirus replication recognition sequence as found in the alphavirus is typically approximately 300 nucleotides in length, which contains a more well defined, minimal 3\u2032 replication recognition sequence. The minimal 3\u2032 replication recognition sequence, conserved among alphaviruses, is a 19 nucleotide sequence (Hill et al., J. Virology, 2693-2704, 1997). These sequences can be modified by standard molecular biological techniques to further minimize the potential for recombination or to introduce cloning sites, with the proviso that they must be recognized by the alphavirus replication machinery.",
                        "The term \u201cminimal 5\u2032 alphavirus replication recognition sequence\u201d refers to the minimal sequence that allows recognition by the nonstructural proteins of the alphavirus but does not result in significant packaging/recombination of RNA molecules containing the sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the minimal 5\u2032 alphavirus replication recognition sequence results in a fifty to one-hundred fold decrease in the observed frequency of packaging/recombination of the RNA containing that sequence. Packaging/recombination of helpers can be assessed by several methods, e.g. the method described by Lu and Silver (J. Virol. Methods 2001, 91(1): 59-65).",
                        "The terms \u201calphavirus RNA replicon\u201d, \u201calphavirus replicon RNA\u201d , \u201calphavirus RNA vector replicon\u201d, and \u201cvector replicon RNA\u201d are used interchangeably to refer to an RNA molecule expressing nonstructural protein genes such that it can direct its own replication (amplification) and comprises, at a minimum, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 alphavirus replication recognition sequences (which may be the minimal sequences, as defined above, but may alternatively be the entire regions from the alphavirus), coding sequences for alphavirus nonstructural proteins, and a polyadenylation tract. It may additionally contain one or more elements to direct the expression, meaning transcription and translation, of a heterologous RNA sequence.

Specific embodiments of the alphavirus RNA replicons may contain one or more attenuating mutations, an attenuating mutation being a nucleotide deletion, addition, or substitution of one or more nucleotide(s), or a mutation that comprises rearrangement or chimeric construction which results in a loss of virulence in a live virus containing the mutation as compared to the appropriate wild-type alphavirus. Examples of an attenuating nucleotide substitution (resulting in an amino acid change in the replicon) include a mutation at nsP1 amino acid position 538, nsP2 amino acid position 96, or nsP2 amino acid position 372 in the alphavirus S.A.AR86, and an example of an attenuating mutation in the non-coding region of the replicon nucleic acid is the substitution of A or C at nucleotide 3 in VEE.",

E3 and 6k serve as membrane translocation/transport signals for the two glycoproteins, E2 and E1. Thus, use of the term El herein can refer to E1, E3-E1, 6k-E1, or E3-6k-E1, and use of the term E2 herein can refer to E2, E3-E2, 6k-E2, or E3-6k-E2.

The helper cell comprises a set of helpers that encode one or more alphavirus structural proteins. As disclosed herein, the helpers may be RNA or DNA. The cell can be any cell that is alphavirus-permissive, i.e. cells that are capable of producing alphavirus particles upon introduction of a viral RNA transcript. Alphavirus-permissive cells include, but are not limited to, Vero, baby hamster kidney (BHK), 293, 293T, chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In certain embodiments, the helper or packaging cell may additionally include a heterologous RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and/or a sequence-specific protease. The nucleic acids encoding alphavirus structural proteins can be present in the helper cell transiently or by stable integration into the genome of the helper cell. The nucleic acid encoding the alphavirus structural proteins that are used to produce alphavirus particles can be under the control of constitutive and/or inducible promoters. In one embodiment, the alpha virus structural protein coding sequences can be provided on a single DNA helper (see Smith et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,335) or as two helper constructs comprising an IRES element in which the translation of these coding sequences can be controlled by the activity of an IRES element. In such embodiments, the IRES element can be active in the specific helper cell type and not active, or minimally active in other cells types. In particular embodiments, the helper cells comprise nucleic acid sequences encoding the alphavirus structural proteins in a combination and/or amount sufficient to produce an alphavirus particle when a recombinant replicon nucleic acid is introduced into the cell under conditions whereby the alphavirus structural proteins are produced and the recombinant replicon nucleic acid is packaged into alphavirus particles disclosed herein.",

Typically, the virion-like structural complex includes one or more alphavirus structural proteins embedded in a lipid envelope enclosing a nucleocapsid that in turn encloses the RNA. The lipid envelope is typically derived from the plasma membrane of the cell in which the particles are produced. Preferably, the alphavirus replicon RNA is surrounded by a nucleocapsid structure comprised of the alphavirus capsid protein, and the alphavirus glycoproteins are embedded in the cell-derived lipid envelope. The structural proteins and replicon RNA may be derived from the same or different alphaviruses. In a specific embodiment, the replicon RNA and structural proteins are from VEE, e.g. see Rayner et al., U.S. Patent Publication 2005-0266550. In another embodiment, the replicon RNA is derived from VEE and the structural proteins are derived from Sindbis Virus (see, e.g. Dubensky et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,236). The alphavirus replicon particles are infectious but propagation-defective, i.e. the replicon RNA cannot propagate beyond the host cell into which the particles initially infect, in the absence of the helper nucleic acid(s) encoding the alphavirus structural proteins.",
                        "A promoter for directing transcription of RNA from DNA, i.e. a DNA dependent RNA polymerase, is employed to produce the alphavirus replicon and helper nucleic acids provided herein. In the present context, a promoter is a sequence of nucleotides recognized by a polymerase and sufficient to cause transcription of an associated (downstream) sequence. In some embodiments, the promoter is constitutive (see below). Alternatively, the promoter may be regulated, i.e., not constitutively acting to cause transcription of the associated sequence. If inducible, there are sequences present which mediate regulation of expression so that the associated sequence is transcribed only when (i) an inducer molecule is present in the medium in or on which the cells are cultivated, or (ii) conditions to which the cells are exposed are changed to be inducing conditions. In the present context, a transcription regulatory sequence includes a promoter sequence and can further include cis-active sequences for regulated expression of an associated sequence in response to environmental signals.",
                        "In certain embodiments of replicon and helper RNAs, transcription and translation are controlled separately by different regulatory elements. The replicon contains a promoter that directs transcription; an IRES element; and a coding sequence (e.g. for a heterologous protein or fragment), in which the IRES element is operably located such that translation of the coding sequence is via a cap-independent mechanism directed by the IRES element and not via a cap-dependent mechanism (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,442,381 to Smith et al.). The term \u201ctranscription\u201d as used herein includes the production of RNA from an alphavirus subgenomic promoter of a recombinant replicon nucleic acid, which can itself be an RNA molecule. That is, the subgenomic promoter on a recombinant replicon or helper RNA molecule can direct the transcription of a messenger RNA encoding a heterologous nucleic acid of interest or an alphavirus structural protein. Separately, the recombinant replicon or helper nucleic acid can be \u201creplicated,\u201d i.e., copied from the 5\u2032 replication recognition sequence through to the replication recognition sequence.",

In the DNA helper embodiments, the promoter functions within a cell to direct transcription of RNA. Potential promoters for in vivo transcription of the construct include eukaryotic promoters such as RNA polymerase II promoters, RNA polymerase III promoters, or viral promoters such as MMTV and MoSV LTR, SV40 early region, RSV or CMV. Many other suitable mammalian and viral promoters are available in the art. Alternatively, DNA dependent RNA polymerase promoters from bacteria or bacteriophage, e.g. SP6, T7, and T3, may be employed for use in vivo, with the matching RNA polymerase being provided to the cell, either via a separate plasmid, RNA vector, or viral vector. In a specific embodiment, the matching RNA polymerase can be stably transformed into a helper cell line under the control of an inducible promoter.",
                        "In certain constructs, control of nucleic acid expression at the level of translation is accomplished by introducing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) downstream of the promoter, e.g. the alphavirus 26S subgenomic promoter, and upstream of the coding sequence, e.g. for the heterologous sequence or an alphavirus structural protein, to be translated. The IRES element is positioned so that it directs translation of the mRNA, thereby minimizing, limiting or preventing initiation of translation of the mRNA from the methyl-7-guanosine (5\u2032)pppN structure present at the 5\u2032 end of the subgenomic mRNA (the \u201ccap\u201d). These constructs result in the IRES controlling translation of a heterologous sequence independently of promoter-driven transcription. IRESes from many different sources can be employed, including viral IRES elements from picornaviruses, e.g., poliovirus (PV) or the human enterovirus 71, e.g. strains 7423/MS/87 and BrCr thereof; from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV); from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV); from flaviviruses, e.g., hepatitis C virus (HCV); from pestiviruses, e.g., classical swine fever virus (CSFV); from retroviruses, e.g., murine leukemia virus (MLV); from lentiviruses, e.g., simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV); from cellular mRNA IRES elements such as those from translation initiation factors, e.g., eIF4G or DAP5; from transcription factors, e.g., c-Myc or NF-\u03baB-repressing factor (NRF); from growth factors, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF B); from homeotic genes, e.g., Antennapedia; from survival proteins, e.g., X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) or Apaf-1; from chaperones, e.g., immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein BiP, plant viruses, as well as any other IRES elements now known or later.",

Helper nucleic acids with no promoter can also be advantageous (see U.S. Published Application No. 2009-0075384). In the case of the helper nucleic acids expressing one or more glycoproteins, it is understood from the art that these sequences are advantageously expressed with a leader or signal sequence at the N-terminus of the structural protein coding region in the nucleic acid constructs. The leader or signal sequence can be derived from the alphavirus, for example E3 or 6k, or it can be a heterologous sequence such as a tissue plasminogen activator signal peptide or a synthetic sequence. Thus, as an example, a first helper nucleic acid may be an RNA molecule encoding capsid-E3-E1, and the second helper nucleic acid may be an RNA molecule encoding capsid-E3-E2. Alternatively, the first helper RNA can encode capsid alone, and the second helper RNA can encode E3-E2-6k-E1.

Preferably, the DNA is introduced via the electroporation-based methods. The DNA is typically electroporated into cells with a decrease in voltage and an increase in capacitance, as compared to that required for the uptake of RNA. In all electroporation reactions, the value for the voltage and capacitance must be set so as to avoid destroying the ability of the packaging (host) cells to produce infective alphavirus particles. Alternatively, the helper function, in this format and under an inducible promoter, can be incorporated into the packaging cell genome prior to the introduction/expression of the RNA vector replicon, and then induced with the appropriate stimulus just prior to, concomitant with, or after the introduction of the RNA vector replicon.",

Following vaccination, tumor diameters were measured with calipers; in some experiments, animals were sacrificed when tumors reached 1 cm diameter, ulcerated or caused discomfort to the animals. For other studies, animals were monitored every 2 to 3 days for 80 days. For the assessment of lung tumor development, lungs were collected 24 days after the intravenous tumor cell challenge, washed three times with PBS and weighed. Tumor-free survival is reported in the figures herein. Each group of mice had 10 mice, p+0.01. For the Kaplan-Meier tumor-free survival curves, mice were considered tumor-free until tumors were visible or palpable P values are calculated with Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test.",
