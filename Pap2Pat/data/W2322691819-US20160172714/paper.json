    "title": "Calcium-based multi-element chemistry for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage",
    "date": "2016-03-22",
    "abstract": "Calcium is an attractive material for the negative electrode in a rechargeable battery due to its low electronegativity (high cell voltage), double valence, earth abundance and low cost; however, the use of calcium has historically eluded researchers due to its high melting temperature, high reactivity and unfavorably high solubility in molten salts. Here we demonstrate a long-cycle-life calcium-metal-based rechargeable battery for grid-scale energy storage. By deploying a multi-cation binary electrolyte in concert with an alloyed negative electrode, calcium solubility in the electrolyte is suppressed and operating temperature is reduced. These chemical mitigation strategies also engage another element in energy storage reactions resulting in a multi-element battery. These initial results demonstrate how the synergistic effects of deploying multiple chemical mitigation strategies coupled with the relaxation of the requirement of a single itinerant ion can unlock calcium-based chemistries and produce a battery with enhanced performance.",

                        "A Ca\u2013Mg (20\u201380\u2009mol%)||Bi cell whose design is depicted in Fig. 1a was cycled at 200\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 current density and 650\u2009\u00b0C operating temperature. As shown in Fig. 1b the cell achieved 98% coulombic and 62% energy efficiencies with a discharge voltage of 0.52\u2009V. The self-discharge current density of the cell, \u223c1\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, is extremely low (see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1), comparable with that of the best-performing Li||Sb\u2013Pb cells2. Even though the concentration of calcium in the negative electrode was quite low (20\u2009mol%) the open-circuit voltage decreased only 0.18\u2009V from that of a cell fitted with a pure calcium negative electrode1812. The volumetric energy density (electrodes basis) of this cell was 197\u2009Wh\u2009L\u22121 (see Supplementary Table 2). In contrast, the higher calcium concentration Ca\u2013Mg (90\u201310\u2009mol%)||Bi cell maintained a cell-discharge voltage above 0.71\u2009V and energy efficiency exceeding 70% (Fig. 1b). The volumetric energy density of the cell increased to 329\u2009Wh\u2009L\u22121 (see Supplementary Table 3). The high concentration of calcium in the negative electrode caused a slight reduction in coulombic efficiency to 96% as a result of a somewhat elevated self-discharge current density (\u22484\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 as shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1). This is well explained by the fact that at 600\u2009\u00b0C the activity of calcium in magnesium is 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 for 20\u201380\u2009mol% Ca\u2013Mg and \u22481 for 90\u201310\u2009mol% Ca\u2013Mg (ref. 12). Upon addition of 10\u2009mol% of magnesium, the self-discharge current density was halved with almost no voltage penalty (\u22480.01\u2009V (refs 8, 12)) when compared with that of the pure Ca||Bi cell (\u2248 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122). In sum, the Ca\u2013Mg||Bi cells were designed to suppress the self-discharge current density while maintaining high cell voltage at a reduced operating temperature. In addition, a Ca\u2013Mg negative electrode with a LiCl\u2013CaCl2 electrolyte can be operated with an antimony (Sb) positive electrode. With higher-cell voltage (0.88\u2009V), higher energy efficiency (74%), and higher volumetric energy density (384\u2009Wh\u2009L\u22121, see Supplementary Table 4) the cell with an Sb positive electrode outperforms one with a Bi positive electrode as shown in Fig. 1b."

                        "Exploiting the low eutectic temperatures of both the Ca\u2013Mg alloy (90\u201310\u2009mol%) and the binary LiCl\u2013CaCl2 electrolyte, we were able to decrease the cell operating temperature to 550\u2009\u00b0C and obtain smooth voltage time traces at current densities ranging from 100 to 955\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 (Fig. 2a). In parallel, the self-discharge current density of Ca\u2013Mg (90\u201310\u2009mol%)||Bi cells was found to decrease to <1\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 (Supplementary Fig. 1), which we attribute to the decrease in solubility of Ca in the electrolyte4715. The fall in discharge capacity with increasing current density is a consequence of the fact that at high current densities the deposition rate of Ca at the electrode-electrolyte interface exceeds the rate of diffusion of Ca metal away from the electrode-electrolyte interface in the Bi positive electrode1011. Because the theoretical capacity of the cell was defined as the mole fraction of calcium, at which the nucleation of the Ca11Bi10 phase occurs (25\u2009mol% at 550\u2009\u00b0C (ref. 8)), at high-current densities it is possible to reach this stoichiometry locally at the interface before the bulk metal electrode reaches this composition. The dependence of cell voltage on current density at several discharged states (9.3, 22.6 and 41.0% of theoretical capacity) is shown in Fig. 2b. The linearity in the I\u2013V characteristic of the cell is evidence of the facile kinetics of the charge/discharge processes. This cell cycled at 200\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 for over 1,400 cycles with 99% coulombic efficiency and 70% round-trip energy efficiency as depicted in Fig. 2c. The average volumetric energy density of this cell was 228\u2009Wh\u2009L\u22121 (see Supplementary Table 5). Additionally noteworthy was that these metrics were achieved without observable voltage loss, side reactions or capacity fade as shown in Fig. 2c,d. Long service life-time translates to low cost of ownership, which is the most important parameter for grid-scale energy storage. No calcium metal battery has ever exhibited such stability."

After 400 cycles at 550\u2009\u00b0C, electrodes were subjected to chemical analysis by direct current plasma emission spectrometry. No corrosion was observed on either the negative or positive current collector. Significantly, both negative and positive electrodes in the partially discharged cells contain Li (Supplementary Table 6). This means that both the Ca and Li ions in the multi-cation salt co-alloy and co-dealloy with both the negative and positive electrodes during charge and discharge. Furthermore, the absence of Mg in the positive electrode proves that there is no participation on the part of Mg in the cell electrochemistry, that is, Mg acts purely as a solvent to reduce the melting point of the negative electrode.

                "This unique multi-cation salt gives rise to the possibility of a multi-element LMB, in which a plurality of active metals participates in faradaic reactions. The high coulombic efficiency (>99%) and excellent retention of discharge capacity observed during lithium co-deposition indicate that the electrode reactions are fully bi-directional. Recognition that co-deposition in a battery can be managed to advantage broadens the selection of salt composition and extends the prediction of the capacity limit. This is in sharp contrast to the practice in calcium electrorefining which considers only those salts, for example, CaCl2\u2013KCl, that obviate or suppress significant co-deposition to maintain the purity of the metal product16. The fact that this cell operates without need for an ion-selective membrane between the electrodes as is the case with sodium\u2013sulfur and sodium\u2013nickel chloride (ZEBRA) batteries, which rely on a \u03b2\u2033-alumina separator, for example, sets this battery chemistry apart from all others. This membrane-free cell designed with a plurality of mitigation strategies opens up multi-element participation, which suppresses Ca reactivity, lowers operating temperature, and finally realizes a Ca-metal-based rechargeable battery that has the potential to meet the performance requirements of grid-scale energy storage applications."

A graphite crucible served as the PCC for Sb. The dimensions of the PCCs were 25\u2009mm in outer diameter, 83\u2009mm in height, 77\u2009mm in depth and 20\u2009mm in inner diameter. The foam NCC was positioned 15\u2009mm above the PCC. By surface tension the foam NCC holds the metal of the negative electrode and thus prevents keeps it from shorting to the positive current collector. The surface area of positive electrode was estimated at 3.14\u2009cm2 by assuming the interface between it and the electrolyte to be perfectly flat. This value was used to derive the current density."

To prepare a dry, homogenous molten salt solution, the test chamber was (1) evacuated to \u223c1\u2009Pa, (2) heated at 80\u2009\u00b0C for 12\u2009h under vacuum, (3) heated at 230\u2009\u00b0C for 12\u2009h under vacuum, (4) purged with ultra-high-purity argon gas (99.999%, O2<1\u2009p.p.m., H2O<1\u2009p.p.m., Airgas Inc) and (5) heated at 700\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h under argon gas flowing at 0.2\u2009cm3\u2009s\u22121. After cooling to room temperature, the pre-melted electrolyte was transferred back to the glove box and ground into powder (\u224810\u2009\u03bcm in diameter). Supplementary Table 7 reports the masses of metal and salt in each cell. To accelerate the measurement of long-term capacity fade at deep discharge (within several months instead of years), we reduced the size of the electrodes of the cell in Fig. 2. It is important to restrict the depletion of LiCl so as to avoid solidification of the molten salt. According to the phase diagram of LiCl\u2013CaCl2 (ref. 14), at 550\u2009\u00b0C for example, the liquid range of composition in the LiCl\u2013CaCl2 molten salt is 58\u201377\u2009mol% of LiCl.
