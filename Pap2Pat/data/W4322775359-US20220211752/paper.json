    "abstract": "Ferroptosis is mediated by lipid peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Glutathione, the key cellular antioxidant capable of inhibiting lipid peroxidation via the activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4), is generated directly from the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, and indirectly from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway. Herein we show that cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD) can synergize with the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 to increase ferroptotic cell death and lipid peroxidation in both murine and human glioma cell lines and in ex vivo organotypic slice cultures. We also show that a cysteine-depleted, methionine-restricted diet can improve therapeutic response to RSL3 and prolong survival in a syngeneic orthotopic murine glioma model. Finally, this CMD diet leads to profound in vivo metabolomic, proteomic and lipidomic alterations, highlighting the potential for improving the efficacy of ferroptotic therapies in glioma treatment with a non-invasive dietary modification.",

                "Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor with a median survival of only 16 months1,2. Glioma treatment resistance has been linked to oxidative stress and glutathione metabolism3. Oxidative stress, broadly defined as the (im)balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, underlies various distinct forms of cell death4,5.",
                "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is iron dependent and mediated by lipid peroxidation. Glutathione, a reducing tripeptide with a thiol-containing cysteine residue, serves as a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to donate electrons to peroxides of polyunsaturated fatty acyl phospholipids6\u20138. Importantly, glutathione biosynthesis is dependent upon intracellular cysteine imported via the glutamate-cystine antiporter (system Xc-) and the enzymatic conversion of cysteine to glutathione. Methionine can also be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway to replenish glutathione. Therefore, ferroptosis inducers include compounds that inhibit system Xc- (erastin, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE), sulfasalazine)7,9, compounds that directly inhibit GPX4 (RSL3, ML-210)8, and compounds that inhibit glutathione synthesis (buthionine sulfoximine)8. Cysteine deprivation can also induce ferroptosis, but this effect is mitigated by the transsulfuration pathway10,11.",
                "Our group has recently shown that a broad range of cancer cell lines, including glioma, is sensitive to ferroptosis inducers12. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that compounds that target system Xc- can synergize with radiation to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation in ex vivo organotypic glioma slices7,13. We hypothesized that given the centrality of glutathione to protect from ferroptosis, depletion of its precursors, cysteine and methionine, should sensitize cells to undergo ferroptosis. Pharmacologic means of cysteine deprivation have been shown to be efficacious in other cancers14. However, blood-brain barrier penetration remains an obstacle for any central nervous system target. We therefore sought to determine the effect of dietary restriction of cysteine and methionine on glioma. We found that cell death, lipid peroxide generation, and transcriptional hallmarks of ferroptosis are enhanced by cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD). We also found that treating mice with a methionine-restricted cysteine-depleted diet is safe and decreased glutathione levels in vivo. Finally, we found this in vivo dietary paradigm improves therapeutic response to RSL3 and survival in an orthotopic syngeneic murine model of glioma and alters the lipid composition of tumors to create a pro-ferroptotic environment. These results support using CMD diet as a non-invasive method for improving the efficacy of ferroptotic treatments and survival of glioma patients."

                        "We first characterized the effects of CMD on glioma responsiveness to ferroptosis. Given that cysteine and methionine are critical for the synthesis of glutathione, the key substrate used by the enzyme GPX4 for detoxification of lipid peroxides, we hypothesized that CMD would synergize with GPX4-mediated ferroptosis induction. To this end, basal media was made either with normal DMEM or DMEM without cysteine and methionine. This process is fully described in the methods section and was adapted for cell culture based on our previous ferroptosis permissive glioma culture methods13,15. We surveyed the responsiveness of human and murine glioma cell lines (Supplementary Table\u00a01) to ferroptosis induction in the presence and absence of cysteine/methionine. The five glioma cell lines assayed had baseline sensitivity to ferroptosis by the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 (Fig.\u00a01a), confirmed by live-cell confocal microscopy showing RSL3 mediated induction of lipid peroxidation as evidenced by green fluorescence shift in the Bodipy-C11 dye following addition of RSL3 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). Ferrostatin, a ferroptosis inhibitor, prevented this lipid peroxidation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). RSL3 mediated cell death, however, was not rescuable by necroptosis inhibitors (Nec-1s) or apoptosis inhibitors (ZVAD-FMK) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c). Dose response assays demonstrated that RSL3 and ML-210, another GPX4 inhibitor, both had synergistic enhancement of ferroptosis with CMD (Fig.\u00a01b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). Increased sensitivity to RSL3 mediated ferroptosis by CMD was seen in all responsive murine and human glioma cell lines (Fig.\u00a01c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e\u2013g). Importantly a low dose (100\u2009nM) of RSL3 in combination with CMD increased lipid peroxidation to levels equivalent to a higher dose of RSL3 (500\u2009nM). The combined effect of CMD plus RSL3 was markedly synergistic as defined by the Chou-Talaly method for quantification of synergy, termed the coefficient of drug interaction (CDI). CDI values <0.7 indicate strong synergy; most cell lines had CDI values <0.1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01h). Pre-treatment incubation of glioma cells for 6\u2009h in CMD sensitized tumor cells to subthreshold doses of RSL3 across all murine glioma cell lines as determined by Bodipy-C11 fluorescence shift (Fig.\u00a01d, e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01i). Importantly, primary human astrocyte cultures were not sensitive to RSL3 mediated cell death, nor RSL3\u2009+\u2009CMD mediated cell death demonstrating a tumor cell specific mechanism of synergistic cell death (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01j).Fig. 1Cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD) sensitizes glioma to RSL3-induced ferroptosis.a 384-well dose-response curves showing response to RSL3 from 5 glioma cell lines: MG1, MG2, MG3, TS543, and KNS42. b Representative 384-well dose-response showing MG3 cells treated with RSL3 (red), RSL3 plus 2\u2009uM Ferrostatin-1 (brown), CMD plus RSL3 (blue), CMD plus RSL3 and 2\u2009uM Ferrostatin-1 (orange). c AUC quantification for dose response curves from 3-independent 96-well dose response curves of MG3 murine glioma cell lines treated with RSL3\u2009\u00b1\u2009CMD\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u2009uM Ferrostatin-1. d Representative Bodipy-C11 flow data from MG1 cells: left panel shows DMSO control (red), 100\u2009nM RSL3 (blue), and 100\u2009nM RSL3 plus 2\u2009uM Ferrostatin-1 (orange) treatment for 30\u2009min.

Similar to the in vitro results for lipid peroxidation, a low subthreshold dose of RSL3 (100\u2009nM) plus CMD increased ROS to levels equivalent to a high dose of RSL3 (500\u2009nM) (Control \u22127.8%, 100\u2009nM RSL3 \u22122.58%, 500\u2009nM RSL3 52.3%, CMD control \u221229.7%, CMD\u2009+\u2009100\u2009nM RSL3 \u221253.5%; Fig.\u00a01f).

Previous studies have shown that CHAC1, PTGS2, and SLC7a11 mRNAs are upregulated following ferroptotic induction. Furthermore, ATF4 has been tied to amino acid deprivation and ferroptotic stress response as a mechanism to increase SLC7a11 expression and cysteine import17\u201319. We harvested mRNA following 24\u2009h of CMD in the murine glioma cells and 48\u2009h of CMD in the human glioma cells. RT-qPCR of the murine glioma cells showed that by 24\u2009h there were significant increases in CHAC1, PTGS2, SLC7a11 and ATF4 transcripts (Fig.\u00a02a i.\u2013iv.). In the human glioma cells a significant upregulation of CHAC1, SLC7a11 and ATF4 transcripts were seen at 48\u2009h (Fig.\u00a02b i.\u2013iii.). These changes were also seen in the ex vivo setting, where organotypic slices were generated from a post-treatment recurrent GBM (Fig.\u00a02c) and a high-grade R132H IDH1 mutated glioma (Fig.\u00a02d) with neighboring slices being placed into either control media or CMD media. After 24\u2009h, RNA was harvested and RT-qPCR showed significant increases in CHAC1 (Fig.\u00a02c, d i.). The IDH1- mutated glioma had significantly increased SLC7a11 expression following CMD, while the IDH1-wild-type glioma trended towards an increase of SLC7a11 (p\u2009=\u20090.08) (Fig.\u00a02c, d ii.).

                        "To characterize further the effects of CMD on glioma cells, we performed targeted metabolite profiling on over 100 metabolites for two murine cell lines (MG1, MG3) treated with CMD for 24\u2009h. Principal component analysis of CMD treated versus control samples demonstrated clear clustering of metabolites according to treatment condition (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). An enrichment ratio based upon the number of differentially assessed metabolites within specific metabolite pathways showed that cysteine/methionine metabolism, glycine-serine-proline metabolism, taurine/hypotaurine metabolism, alanine/aspartate/glutamate metabolism and selenocompound metabolism were significantly impacted by CMD (FDR-corrected p-value <0.05) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). The heatmap of the top 50 differentially assessed metabolites showed clear separation between CMD and control samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). This metabolite survey showed a reduction in both oxidized and reduced glutathione (LFC 0.124; FDR-corrected p-value <0.05) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). This was further confirmed by a colorimetric assay demonstrating a significant reduction in reduced glutathione across all cell lines with 24\u2009h of CMD (Fig.\u00a03a). To confirm this metabolite survey, a follow-up targeted metabolite experiment with 23 internal standards for metabolites of interest in the cysteine methionine metabolism was performed on MG3 cells. Effects of CMD at 24 and 48\u2009h deprivation were examined. Significant reductions in concentrations of hypotaurine, methionine and glutamate were noted at 24\u2009h (Fig.\u00a03b); at 48\u2009h both oxidized and reduced glutathione, glutamate, and hypotaurine/taurine were also decreased (Fig.\u00a03d).

Interestingly, although oxidized glutathione showed a decrease at 2 days of CMD, at 4 days this difference was not significant (normalized mean control: 0.24; CMD 2 day: \u22120.12; CMD 4 day: \u22120.08; CMD 2 day v. control p\u2009=\u20090.04; CMD 4 day vs. control p\u2009=\u20090.18). Multiple other metabolites including acetyl-methionine (normalized mean control: 0.37; CMD 2 day: \u22120.20; CMD 4 day: \u22120.11; CMD 2 day v. control p\u2009=\u20090.01; CMD 4 day vs. control p\u2009=\u20090.07), acetyl-carnitine (normalized mean control: 0.30; CMD 2 day: \u22120.20; CMD 4 day: \u22120.05; CMD 2 day v. control p\u2009=\u20090.02; CMD 4 day v. control p\u2009=\u20090.17) and propionyl-carnitine (normalized mean control: 0.29; CMD 2 day: \u22120.21; CMD 4 day: \u22120.02; CMD 2 day v. control p\u2009=\u20090.01; CMD 4 day vs. control p\u2009=\u20090.23). These findings point to possible in vivo compensatory mechanisms (Fig.\u00a04e).",
                        "Similarly, we performed targeted metabolite profiling on flash frozen tumor tissue harvested from end-stage MG3 tumor bearing mice (control n\u2009=\u20094 male mice, CMD n\u2009=\u20095 male mice) examining ~200 metabolites of interest. Metabolite profiling of chronic diet end-stage tumors from mice transitioned to the CMD diet or control diet at day post injection 7 showed decreased levels of hypotaurine (FC\u2009=\u20090.12, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and oxidized/total glutathione (FC\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009=\u20090.006), and a trend towards decreased cystathionine (FC\u2009=\u20090.36, P\u2009=\u20090.08). (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e). Quantitative metabolite pathway analysis showed key changes within taurine/hypotaurine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, arginine metabolism, the TCA cycle, and fatty acid elongation/degradation (p\u2009<\u20090.10) (Fig.\u00a04f).",
                        "To explore changes induced by CMD on glioma cell phenotype at the molecular level, proteomic analysis of adjacent sections from MG3 control (n\u2009=\u20093, male) and CMD (n\u2009=\u20094, male) mice was performed. CMD induced alterations in numerous protein species (299 protein species differentially expressed; FDR-corrected p-value 0.2, |LFC\u2009|\u2009>\u20090.58). Of the pathways activated in CMD versus control, the one with the greatest enrichment score was lipid catabolic processes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02g). Other gene/protein sets enriched in CMD versus control included oxidation/reduction processes, positive regulation of lipid catabolism and cell substrate adhesion and extracellular space. Interestingly, CMD led to a robust immunosuppressive signature involving downregulation of proteins related to antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02g). These findings suggest that CMD could affect patients\u2019 response to immunotherapy.",
                        "We then performed a joint pathway analysis combining the proteomic differential expression matrix with FDR\u2009<\u20090.2 and |LFC\u2009|\u2009>\u20090.58 and the metabolomic differential expression matrix of compounds with |LFC\u2009>\u20090.58| yielding a comprehensive tissue level view of pathways altered by the diet (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02f). Cysteine/methionine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, ferroptosis, glycerophospholipid metabolism were relevant pathways significantly altered based on the joint proteomic and metabolomic analysis. Thus, on both a metabolite and protein level it is clear that CMD led to profound alteration of the tumor microenvironment.",
                        "To identify spatial distributions of metabolites and lipids in the tumor tissues and to further analyze metabolic changes induced by ferroptosis, we performed mass spectrometry imaging experiments. Desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry (DESI-IMS) was carried out on six end-stage MG3 tumor samples (Control n\u2009=\u20093, CMD n\u2009=\u20093) in both positive and negative ion modes. Overall, the major detected ions in mouse glioma tissues were lipids including saturated and unsaturated free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), and phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylserines (PS), phosphatidylglycerols (PG) and sulfatides (ST). The results outlined are from the negative ion mode where more significant changes in lipid abundances were observed between control and CMD groups. The abundance distribution maps for a CMD and a control slice with tumor areas outlined are shown for lipid species increased in CMD (Fig.\u00a04g) and lipid species decreased in CMD (Fig.\u00a04h). Variable importance of projection plots for significantly altered lipid species are shown in Fig.\u00a04i. Among the identified lipid species, the relative abundance of several lipid species including FA 18:2, FA 18:1, PS 18:22:6, PI 18:0_20:4, PI 34:1, PG 34:1, and C20(OH)ST were significantly increased in the tumor regions of the CMD group compared to the control group. In contrast, the relative abundances of PC 16:0_18:1, PE 18:0_20:4, PC 16:0_20:4, and PE 16:0_22:6, and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) were significantly decreased (FDR-corrected p-value <0.05) in the tumor regions of CMD mice compared to the tumors of control mice (Fig.\u00a04i). Lipidomic DESI analysis of non-tumor regions showed that the majority of lipid profiles in the non-tumor regions were not significantly altered, pointing to tumor specific effects of the CMD diet (Supplementary Table\u00a02).",
                        "To examine transcriptional changes in vivo, we injected MG3 cells in mice that were then treated with the four conditions (control diet + DMSO local delivery, CMD diet + DMSO local delivery, control diet + RSL3 local delivery and CMD diet + RSL3 local delivery), and harvested the tumors after 3 days of treatment. RT-qPCR was performed on tissue lysates to examine transcriptional changes associated with each condition. To account for treatment related decreases in tumor cells, we normalized transcript expression to olig2 levels within samples, as our previous studies have shown that olig2 is highly expressed by tumor cells in our murine glioma model21. Our data show that co-treatment with CMD diet and RSL3 significantly upregulated transcripts canonically associated with ferroptosis in vivo (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a\u2013c)."

                "Ferroptosis is a promising avenue for cancer treatment22,23. This novel form of programmed cell death is induced by inhibition of GPX4, an enzyme that facilitates glutathione mediated detoxification of toxic lipid peroxides24. Herein, we demonstrate that murine and human glioma cells are susceptible to ferroptosis via GPX4 inhibition by drugs such as RSL3. We also show that RSL3 mediated cell death is ferroptosis specific (independent of apoptosis or necroptosis) and is associated with increased lipid peroxidation. Moreover, we demonstrate that nutrient deprivation of cysteine and methionine decreases cell survival, and synergistically increases lipid peroxidation and cell death when combined with RSL3. Ex vivo slices from human gliomas showed both synergistic sensitivity to CMD and ferroptosis inducers as well as significant transcriptional upregulation of CHAC1 and SLC7a11 following CMD. Notably, in vivo dietary deprivation of cysteine and methionine resulted in increased survival, though modest, with distinctive changes in the lipidomics, proteomics and metabolomic profile of the tumors. Co-treatment with CMD diet and local delivery of RSL3 led to a robust survival improvement over control conditions.",
                "Our analysis of the effects of CMD in vitro showed significant decreases in metabolites in 3 major pathways including cysteine-methionine metabolism, taurine/hypotaurine metabolism, glutathione synthesis. These findings translated to the in vivo setting where an orthotopic mouse glioma model treated with CMD diet showed decreases in pathways related to glutathione synthesis, and hypotaurine/taurine metabolism, demonstrating that systemic dietary deprivation affects tumor metabolism and growth within the central nervous system. Previous studies have shown that depleting glutathione with the drug Erastin leads to ferroptosis8. We show that CMD can decrease glutathione in glioma cells in both the in vitro and in vivo settings.",
                "We also show the CMD diet is a ferroptotic stress as demonstrated through a multi-omic approach. Our analysis showed that even within 2-4 days metabolite profiles of tumors showed reductions in methionine and glutathione, among other metabolites. End-stage tumors showed alterations in a host of lipids and metabolites associated with oxidative stress and aerobic/anaerobic respiration. DESI-IMS data showed a shift in tumor lipid profiles towards more pro-ferroptotic species. The levels of PI 38:4 and PS 40:6 (PI 18:0_20:4, PS 18:22:6), phospholipids with PUFA tails, were increased significantly in the CMD group. Moreover, it has been shown that phospholipids with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid tails are ferroptosis resistant. PC 16:0_18:1, one of the most abundant phospholipids in the brain with proven anti-ferroptotic activity25, was depleted significantly in the CMD group. Many of the other compounds significantly decreased in CMD tumors (PE 18:0_20:4, PC 16:0_20:4, and PE 16:0_22:6) have been previously reported as depleted after treatment with a known ferroptosis inducer, imidazole ketone erastin26. Notably we saw upregulation of FA18:2, a omega-6 PUFA tied to decreased antioxidant capacity in vivo27,28.",
                "Previous studies have looked at ketogenic diets, caloric restriction and high-fat low carb diets in the CT-2A orthotopic murine astrocytoma models29\u201334. Here we show that CMD diet was tolerated throughout the duration of the survival studies and was associated with a significant survival benefit, indicating local effects on brain tumor growth and response to RSL3. Notably, the mice on the CMD diet maintained a significantly lower weight, and there may be issues with systemic toxicity that will need to be addressed in future studies. In identifying a transcriptional and metabolic signature we hope to aid future translational efforts with the CMD diet by providing a profile to assess treatment efficacy. The CMD diet was also associated with key tumor specific metabolic and lipid changes that are promising avenues for future investigation and combination treatment. Notably, the tumor microenvironment is heterogenous, and regional variance associated with necrosis, microvascular proliferation and infiltrated brain tissue may contribute to the patterns of phospholipid abundance. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of CMD on the brain tumor microenvironment and to assess whether they are therapeutically actionable. Strategies combining the sensitizing CMD diet with either classic ferroptosis inducing agents, RSL3, and non-canonical inducers like radiation hold additional therapeutic potential. Our data adds to a growing body of evidence showing that certain cancers, including glioma, are sensitive to ferroptosis and rely on cysteine metabolism to deal with oxidative and ferroptotic stress14,35."

HCD fragmentation was applied with 27% collision energy and resulting fragments were detected using the rapid scan rate in the Orbitrap. The spectra were recorded in profile mode. DIA data were analyzed with directDIA 2.0 (Deep learning augmented spectrum-centric DIA analysis) in Spectronaut Pulsar X, a mass spectrometer vendor independent software from Biognosys. The default settings were used for targeted analysis of DIA data in Spectronaut except the decoy generation was set to mutated. The false discovery rate (FDR) will be estimated with the mProphet approach and set to 1% at peptide precursor level and at 1% at protein level. Results obtained from Spectronaut were further analyzed using the Spectronaut statistical package. Significantly changed protein abundance was determined by unpaired t-test with a threshold for significance of p\u2009<\u20090.20 (permutation-based FDR correction) and 0.58 log2FC."
