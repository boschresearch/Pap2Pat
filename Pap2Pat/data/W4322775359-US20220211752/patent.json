    "abstract": "Ferroptosis (cell death mediated by iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation) results from lipid peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acyl moieties. Glutathione, the key cellular antioxidant capable of inhibiting lipid peroxidation via the activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4), is generated directly from the sulfur-containing aminoacid cysteine, and indirectly from methionine via the transsulfuration pathway. Cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD) in the diet can synergistically increase RSL3-mediated cell death and lipid peroxidation in both murine and human glioma cell lines and in ex-vivo organotypic slice cultures. A cysteine-depleted, methionine-restricted diet can improve survival in an syngeneic orthotopic murine glioma model. This CMD diet leads to profound in-vivo metabolomic, proteomic and lipidomic alterations, leading to improvements in the efficacy of ferroptotic therapies in glioma treatment with a non-invasive dietary modification.",

                                "Each year an estimated 1.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer in the United States with 600,000 patients succumbing to cancer each year (American Cancer Society, 2017 figures). Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, and has a median survival of only 14 months. Glioma treatment resistance has been linked to oxidative stress and glutathione metabolism. Oxidative stress, broadly defined as the (im)balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses, underlies various distinct forms of cell death.",
                                "Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is iron dependent and mediated by lipid peroxidation. Glutathione, a reducing tripeptide with a thiol-containing cysteine residue, serves as a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to donate electrons to peroxides of polyunsaturated fatty acyl phospholipids. Importantly, glutathione biosynthesis is dependent upon intracellular cysteine imported via the glutamate-cystine antiporter (system Xc\u2212) and the enzymatic conversion of cysteine to glutathione. Methionine can also be converted to cysteine via the trans-sulfuration pathway to replenish glutathione. Therefore, ferroptosis inducers include compounds that inhibit system Xc\u2212 (erastin, imidazole ketone erastin (IKE), sulfasalazine), compounds that directly inhibit GPX4 (RSL3, ML-210), and compounds that inhibit glutathione synthesis (buthionine sulfoximine).",
                                "There are more than 100 distinct types of cancers that share common hallmarks, including sustained proliferative signaling and evasion of growth suppressors. Cancers show diverse metabolic requirements influenced by factors such as tissue of origin, microenvironment, and genetics. The consumption profiles of cancer cells indicate homogeneous demands of energy metabolism and protein synthesis, which are vital biological processes for the malignant proliferation of cancer cells. The leading substrates consumed by cancer cells include glucose and amino acids, such as tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, lysine, valine, methionine, serine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, and glutamine.",
                                "Additionally, cancer cells have increased iron demand and are more vulnerable to iron-catalyzed necrosis or ferroptosis. Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome affecting many cancer patients that is associated with increased mortality and impaired response to chemotherapy. Dietary approaches to cancer treatment and cachexia may potentially improve treatment outcomes. There is a growing interest in targeting the metabolic environment in cancer and neurologic diseases. Currently no convenient solution for patients exists that enhance ferroptosis and/or deplete cysteine and methionine. Patient compliance is also a critical component for successful implementation, and can be a difficult problem for patients.",

Moreover, compounds that target system Xc\u2212 can synergize with radiation to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation in ex vivo organotypic glioma slices. Given the centrality of glutathione to protect from ferroptosis, depletion of its precursors, cysteine and methionine, should sensitize cells to undergo ferroptosis. Pharmacologic means of cysteine deprivation have been shown to be efficacious in other cancers. However, blood-brain barrier penetration remains an obstacle for any central nervous system target. Therefore, to determine the effect of dietary restriction of cysteine and methionine on glioma the studies described here were performed. Cell death, lipid peroxide generation, and transcriptional hallmarks of ferroptosis are enhanced by cysteine and methionine deprivation (CMD).",

These findings translated to the in vivo setting where an orthotopic mouse glioma model treated with CMD diet showed decreases in pathways related to glutathione synthesis, and hypotaurine/taurine metabolism. This demonstrates that the systemic dietary deprivation provided by the invention affects tumor metabolism and growth within the central nervous system.",
                                "Aerobic and anaerobic respiration were decreased following CMD in vitro, Also, in vivo metabolomic data showed alteration within pyruvate and TCA cycle pathways, particularly acetyl-CoA was negatively correlated with oxidized glutathione levels and may demonstrate a cellular escape mechanism to chronic CMD exposure.",
                                "The CMD diet was shown to be a ferroptotic stress as demonstrated through a multiomic approach. DESI-IMS data showed a shift in tumor lipid profiles towards more pro-ferroptotic species. The levels of PI 38:4 and PS 40:6 (PI 18:0_20:4, PS 18:22:6), phospholipids with PUFA tails, were increased significantly in the CMD group. Moreover, phospholipids with saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid tails are ferroptosis resistant. PC 16:0_18:1, one of the most abundant phospholipids in the brain with proven anti-ferroptotic activity, was depleted significantly in the CMD group.",

Here the inventive CMD diet was shown to be a non-toxic, chronically tolerated regimen associated with a modest but significant survival benefit, indicating local effects on brain tumor growth from a systemic diet. The CMD diet was also associated with key tumor specific metabolic and lipid changes that are promising avenues for future investigation and combination treatment.",
                                "In summary, this CMD diet leads to tumor-specific decreases in glutathione levels in vitro. In addition, a methionine-restricted cysteine-depleted diet is safe in vivo and decreases glutathione levels in vivo. Finally, this in vivo dietary paradigm improves survival in an orthotopic syngeneic murine model of glioma and alters the lipid composition of tumors to create a pro-ferroptotic environment. These results support using CMD diet as a non-invasive method for improving the efficacy of ferroptotic treatments and survival of glioma patients."

                                "Murine and human glioma cells are susceptible to ferroptosis via GPX4 inhibition by drugs such as RSL3. RSL3-mediated cell death is ferroptosis-specific (independent of apoptosis or necroptosis) and is associated with increased lipid peroxidation. Moreover, nutrient deprivation of cysteine and methionine decreases cancer cell survival, and synergistically increases lipid peroxidation and cell death when combined with RSL3. Ex vivo slices from human gliomas showed both synergistic sensitivity to CMD and ferroptosis inducers as well as significant transcriptional upregulation of CHAC1 and SLC7a11 following CMD. In vivo dietary deprivation of cysteine and methionine resulted in increased survival with distinctive changes in the lipidomics, proteomics and metabolomic profile of the tumors.",

The dietary formulation and supplement also target cancer patients with and adult patients that have adequately higher energetic needs than currently available supplements provide. By restricting sulfur-containing amino acids from the patient's diet, cancer cells can be selectively targeted and sensitized to treatment. Therefore, the dietary formulations provide dual restriction of the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine as a dietary intervention to selectively target cancer cells, sensitizing them to radiation and standard-of-care cancer chemotherapies.",
                                "The normal diet of a patient (which would contain cysteine and methionine) can interfere with the benefits of providing the CMD diet. Thus, the formulation embodiments preferably provide enough caloric content and fat to sufficiently satiate the patient so that the appetite is satisfied to avoid the patient consuming foods that could disrupt the benefits of the CMD diet. Thus, the formulation contains a satisfying amount of fat, carbohydrates and protein.",
                                "The dual deprivation of sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine) is able to selectively target cancer cells and sensitize them to both radiation and standard of care chemotherapies. While the diet and formulation embodiments are particularly adaptable for treating glioma/glioblastoma, the mechanism for how the formulation and related diet works is broadly applicable to other cancer types where patients commonly undergo radiation or chemotherapy treatments. Adhering to this diet can greatly improve patient outcomes.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the invention provides a specific restricted dietary formulation and methods for the treatment of various cancers. In one embodiment, embodiments based on the diet are formulated as a nutritional powder or granules or a liquid or semi-liquid or slurry/shake with a defined caloric intake that intentionally excludes two amino acids: cysteine and methionine. The dietary formulation thus can be formulated with additional inert or non-active ingredients, carriers, or fillers. Such inert ingredients can include water, electrolytes, suspending agents, gelling agents, thickeners, soluble and/or insoluble fiber, inert fillers, flavorings, and the like.",
                                "Preferably, the dietary formulations are created for adult patients taking into account adult energetic needs, but they can be modified for pediatric patients. The formulations also preferably are designed to contain a high enough caloric density to provide to the specific cancer patient population sufficient calories and nutrition, since cancer patients commonly have energetic needs that are more difficult to meet and require high caloric density to continue through the rigors of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Therefore, certain embodiments of the dietary formulation contains about 0 to about 4 kcal per serving, preferably about 1,250 to about 2,500 kcal per serving and most preferably about 1,500 to about 2,500 kcal. The serving of the formulations according to the embodiment can be determined by the treating physician, oncologist, or nutritionist based on the patient's size and weight, general health, severity of disease, activity level, caloric need, nutritional status, and the like.",

The patient can consume the diet by mouth, by nasogastric tube, or any suitable method as designated by the practitioner. The dietary formulation can be provided in divided doses to provide sufficient nutritional and caloric needs for the patient.",
                                "This invention has been tested here on a notoriously hard-to-treat cancer: glioma/glioblastoma. Without wishing to be bound by theory, ferroptosis is induced by inhibition of GPX4, an enzyme that facilitates glutathione-mediated detoxification of toxic lipid peroxides, and therefore is a promising avenue for cancer treatment.",

This specific diet and dietary formulation is provided to or administered to patients, for example patients who have been diagnosed with cancer or pre-cancer, or who are suspected of having cancer. Preferably the diet is provided before cancer treatment begins and continues during treatment. The cancer treatment can be any standard-of-care treatment as determined by the practitioner of skill, however the preferred cancer treatments for use with methods according to the invention are radiation or chemotherapy with a focus on ferroptosis-inducing agents such as RSL3, Erastin, and the like. Other therapies contemplated for use with the inventive methods include surgery, laser ablation, focused ultrasound, and the like.",

In other embodiments, the dietary formulation also can benefit patients with obesity and related illnesses (i.e. diabetes, hypertension) and be useful in treatments for cachexia, especially cachexia associated with cancer or HIV/AIDS. In addition, the dietary formulation can be used as a health supplement for malnutrition and in research models for studying amino acid metabolism.

The CMD diet or formulation and the cancer treatment preferably are provided in a therapeutic amount so as to induce a synergistic effect. In one embodiment, a synergistic effect is recognized when a coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) of <1.0. (CDI=AB/A\u00d7B). AB is the ratio of the combination groups to control group; A or B is the ratio of the single agent group to control group.

Given that cysteine and methionine are necessary for the synthesis of glutathione, the substrate used by the enzyme GPX4 for detoxification of lipid peroxides, CMD should synergize with GPX4-mediated ferroptosis induction.

With our control media representing 100% cysteine and 100% methionine, we made various culture media depriving just one or both amino acids. Cells were treated for 24 hours in the culture media plus a treatment drug including a known ferroptosis inducer, RSL-3, with a glutathione analog/possible ferroptosis inhibitor N-acetylcysteine, or the combination of both. The effect was quantified using bioluminescence assays to assess cell viability.",

Mouse cells were plated at a density of 4,000 cells per well and human cells plated at a density of 2,000 cells per well in 96 well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were switched into treatment media (control or CMD) and treated with radiation using a Gammacell 40 Caesium 137 irradiator (Theratronics\u2122) and incubated for either 120 hours. All cell viability assays as described above were quantified using Cell-Titer Glo (Promega\u2122) ATP based bioluminescence. To determine cell viability, a 50% Cell Titer Glo and 50% cell culture medium were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Luminescence was assessed on a Promega\u2122 GloMax Microplate Reader.",

Values less than 1 signify synergy or greater than additive effects. Thus, this diet synergizes with radiation treatment in mouse and human glioma cells. See FIG. 29.",

This mechanism likely occurs through a depletion of glutathione, an antioxidant that reduces cancer cell death due to radiation and various chemotherapeutics.",

Mice underwent orthotopic injections with MG3 mouse glioma cells using a Jackson\u2122 stereotactic frame for reproducible targeting of glioma cells to the subcortical white matter. After injection, mice were randomized into groups and received a control diet or a CMD diet 7 days following cell implantation. These diets were formulated to have controlled levels of all macro and micronutrients based on weight/weight values except for cysteine and methionine; while the control diet has 0.43% methionine and 0.33% cystine, the CMD diet had 0.15% methionine and 0.0% cysteine.",
                                "Thus, the in vivo mouse study where a cysteine depleted/methionine restricted diet is well tolerated, decreases the rate of glioma growth, and can increase survival of orthotopic glioma tumor bearing mice with no observable toxicity. See FIG. 31, which shows that glioma growth is slowed in vivo when mice are placed on a cysteine deprived/methionine restricted diet, and FIG. 32, which shows that a cysteine deprived/methionine restricted diet improved survival in a mouse model of diffusely infiltrating glioma. Taken together these findings show that methods according to embodiments of the invention are promising for use in cancer patients."
