                        "Microsatellites (\u201cMS(s)\u201d) or microsatellite DNA are genomic regions containing tandem sequence repeats. Generally, microsatellites are tracts of variable-length repeats (generally repeated 5-50 times) of short DNA motifs (ranging in length from 1-6 or more base pairs). Microsatellites may encompass a variety of low complexity sequences; however, most MSs are mono- or di-nucleotide repeats. Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome, which are distributed throughout the genome.",
                        "Defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) can promote a hyper-mutable state in which cells develop insertion and deletion mutations (indels) at microsatellites. This hypermutation, termed microsatellite instability (MSI), has been identified to contribute to the development of certain cancers. Tumor MSI occurs when one or more MS regions have dramatically higher numbers of MS indels. Tumors with MS regions that do not display dramatically higher numbers of MS indels are generally referred to as microsatellite stable (\u201cMSS\u201d). Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint blockade via administration of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors with or without cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, has been identified as effective for certain cancers characterized by MSI. However, a large proportion of patients with MSI cancers do not respond to immunotherapy. A need therefore exists for improved compositions and methods for treating MSI tumors, as well as for treating other forms of cancer."

In particular, the instant disclosure has identified that microsatellite unstable cancers are particularly susceptible to treatment with anti-WRN helicase agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the WRN helicase has been newly identified herein as required for preserving DNA integrity and cellular viability of cancers that exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or impaired mismatch repair (MMR). Classification of a cancer as MSI and/or impaired for MMR therefore identifies anti-WRN helicase agents as preferred therapeutic options for such cancers, in many cases distinct from those treatments previously appreciated for MSI and/or impaired MMR cancer treatment. WRN helicase-targeting agents are additionally contemplated as components of combination therapies for MSI and/or impaired MMR cancers.",

                        "The present disclosure is directed, at least in part, to the discovery that cancers that exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI) require the WRN helicase to preserve DNA integrity and cellular viability. As such, the WRN helicase is herein identified as a therapeutic target for MSI and/or impaired MMR cancers, and WRN inhibitory agents are specifically discovered as an effective therapeutic selection for cancers that exhibit MSI and/or impaired MMR. Compositions and methods for identification of an MSI and/or impaired MMR cancer and selection of a therapeutic that includes a WRN inhibitory agent (either as a single therapeutic or as a component of a combination therapy) are described in additional detail below.",
                        "Defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) can promote a hyper-mutable state in which cells develop insertion and deletion mutations (indels) at nucleotide-repeat regions termed microsatellites (Vilar and Gruber. Nature reviews. Clinical oncology. 7: 153-162). This class of hypermutations, termed microsatellite instability (MSI), contributes to the development of several cancers, predominantly in colon (15%) (4), gastric (22%) (5), endometrial (20-30%) (6), and ovarian (12%) (7) cancers. MSI and/or impaired MMR cancers can arise due to germline defects in the MMR genes MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or MLH1 via a condition known as Lynch Syndrome (4). More commonly, MSI and/or impaired MMR cancers arise after somatic inactivation of a MMR gene, typically MLH1 loss via promoter hypermethylation (4). In recent years, the clinical implications of MSI status has grown, owing to the success of immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint blockade with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors with or without cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, in these cancers. Although MSI has been associated with notable responses to immune checkpoint blockade, 45-60% of patients with MSI cancers do not respond to immunotherapy, and use of these immune checkpoint blockade agents can be limited by their toxicity (8, 9).",
                        "Synthetic lethality is an interaction between two genetic events through which the co-occurrence of these two genetic events leads to cell death, but each event alone does not. In some instances, identification of a synthetic lethality can be exploited for cancer therapeutics (1). DNA repair processes have been previously described to represent attractive synthetic lethal targets, because many cancers exhibit an impairment of a DNA repair pathway, which leads to dependence on specific repair proteins (2). The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors in cancers that exhibit deficiencies in homologous recombination has highlighted the potential of this approach (3).",
                        "Within the instant disclosure, data from large-scale silencing screens that employ CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference have been analyzed, and it was strikingly identified that the RecQ DNA helicase WRN was selectively essential in MSI models in vitro and in vivo, yet dispensable in models of cancers that are microsatellite stable. Consistent with this observation, WRN depletion induced double-strand DNA breaks and promoted both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis selectively in MSI models. MSI cancer models specifically required the helicase activity, but not the exonuclease activity of WRN. These findings have therefore identified WRN as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in MSI cancers. In particular, the administration of a WRN inhibitor, either alone or in combination with another agent, is contemplated as a treatment specifically for a patient specifically identified as having or at risk of developing a MSI cancer.",

                        "Identification of a tissue, tumor and/or cancer of a subject as exhibiting MSI and/or impaired MMR can be performed by any method available in the art. Certain methods and compositions described herein relate to identification of a cancer as exhibiting MSI and/or impaired MMR, the presence of which is based upon an assessment of a sample for the presence of indels at microsatellites. As noted elsewhere herein, an exemplary clinical MSI assay can be performed via a single multiplex PCR reaction that is analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (Boland et al. Cancer Research. 58: 5248). Whole genome sequencing (or sequencing of a subset of the genome, optionally with emphasis upon sequencing of microsatellites) can also be used to identify MSI and/or impaired MMR in a subject, tissue, tumor and/or cancer. As noted herein, recently published MSI annotations have been used to classify cell lines on next generation sequencing analysis of the total number of genetic deletions and fraction of deletions located within microsatellite regions as described in Phase II of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project, employed as a proxy for assessment of MSI vs. MSS status.",
                        "In certain aspects, the instant disclosure provides methods and kits that involve and/or allow for assessment of the presence or absence of one or more MSI indicators. In particular embodiments, a subject, tissue, cell and/or sample is assessed for one or more variants and/or sites of MSI within genomic microsatellite regions."

Such cancers for which MSI and/or impaired MMR is prevalent include endometrial cancers, gastric cancers, colorectal cancers and ovarian cancers. Consideration of MSI and/or impaired MMR prevalence within such cancer populations is detailed below and elsewhere herein.",

                                "CRC is the third most common cancer type in which about 1.4 million new cases are diagnosed each year. Additionally, CRC results in about 700,000 deaths per year. Unfortunately, the frequency of CRC appears to be increasing throughout the developed world, presumably due to increased risk of CRC associated with alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, diabetes, the consumption of large amounts of meat, and little physical activity.",
                                "About 15% are associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), which can be defined as somatic changes in the length of microsatellites. Based on microsatellite status (e.g., MSI versus MSS), colorectal tumors can be divided into 3 the categories: 1. tumors with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), 2. tumors with low levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-L), and tumors that are microsatellite stable (MSS).",
                                "Lynch syndrome is a hereditary form of autosomal dominant colon cancer that results from inherited mismatch repair gene defects and is characterized by high levels of microsatellite instability and constitutes about 20% of MSI-H CRCs. Lynch Syndrome patients typically display initial cancer onset in their mid-forties, which is in sharp contrast to patients with sporadic MSI-H cancers where the average age is over seventy.",
                                "Sporadic MSI-H tumors are usually caused by the epigenetic silencing of MLH1 caused by promoter methylation. Traditionally, Lynch Syndrome tumors our thought to arise from adenomas, while sporadic MSI-H CRCs are believed to arise from serrated polyps. Approximately 80% of MSI-H tumors are sporadic tumors.

In certain embodiments, sequence-specific oligonucleotide inhibitors of WRN are delivered as naked oligonucleotides, as modified oligonucleotides (e.g., as GalNAc conjugates), within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), or as components of other art-recognized delivery modalities for oligonucleotide therapeutics. Exemplary description of oligonucleotide inhibitors of WRN can be found, e.g., in European Patent Application No. 2434009 and/or in U.S. Pat. No. 6,448,080. In certain embodiments, exemplary WRN inhibitor compositions may be given in combination with chemotherapy or ionizing radiation, or with a small molecule that induces DNA damage and/or modulates a DNA repair pathway. An exemplary WRN inhibitor may be an oligonucleotide inhibitor of WRN, which may have at least 33% nucleotide sequence identity with (TTAGGG)n, wherein n=1 to 20. An exemplary WRN inhibitor may be an oligonucleotide inhibitor of WRN, which may have at least 50% nucleotide sequence identity with (TTAGGG)n, wherein n=1 to 20. From about zero to about ten of the first 3\u2032-nucleotide linkages may be hydrolyzable by a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 nuclease. An exemplary oligonucleotide WRN inhibitor may be an oligonucleotide with at least about 33% to about 100% or at least 50% to about 100% nucleotide sequence identity with (TTAGGG)n, wherein n is from about 1 to about 20. As used herein, \u201c(TTAGGG)n\u201d, when used in the context of a comparison of nucleic sequence identity, refers to a reference nucleic acid. Sequence identity is calculated by performing an alignment of the oligonucleotide and the reference nucleic acid and dividing (a) the number of identical nucleotides in the alignment, by (b) the total number of base pairs of the oligonucleotide. For example, the oligonucleotide may be 11-bp with the sequence GTTAGGGTTAG (SEQ ID NO: 29) which has >91% sequence identity with (TTAGGG)2. An exemplary oligonucleotide WRN inhibitor may be of a form including, but not limited to, single-stranded, double-stranded, or a combination thereof.

The oligonucleotide may also be an EST. Also specifically contemplated is an analog, derivative, fragment, homolog or variant of the oligonucleotide. Compositions of the present invention may be formulated as a liposome preparation. The liposome preparation can comprise liposomes which penetrate the cells of interest or the stratum corneum, and fuse with the cell membrane, resulting in delivery of the contents of the liposome into the cell. For example, liposomes such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,211 of Yarosh, U.S. Pat. No. 4,621,023 of Redziniak et al. or U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,703 of Redziniak et al. can be used.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J Pharmaceutical Sciences 66 (1977):1-19, incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the application, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds to be administered of the application carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.",
                                "Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable ester\u201d refers to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound (e.g., an FDA-approved compound where administered to a human subject) or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moeity advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.",
                                "Furthermore, the term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs\u201d as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the certain compounds of the present application which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the issues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the application. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of an agent of the instant disclosure, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, (1987), both of which are incorporated herein by reference.",
                                "The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are preferably of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food (NF) grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade) Moreover, compositions intended for in vivo use are usually sterile. To the extent that a given compound must be synthesized prior to use, the resulting product is typically substantially free of any potentially toxic agents, particularly any endotoxins, which may be present during the synthesis or purification process. Compositions for parental administration are also sterile, substantially isotonic and made under GMP conditions.",
                                "Formulations may be optimized for retention and stabilization in a subject and/or tissue of a subject, e.g., to prevent rapid clearance of a formulation by the subject. Stabilization techniques include cross-linking, multimerizing, or linking to groups such as polyethylene glycol, polyacrylamide, neutral protein carriers, etc. in order to achieve an increase in molecular weight.",
                                "Other strategies for increasing retention include the entrapment of the agent, such as a WRN inhibitor, in a biodegradable or bioerodible implant. The rate of release of the therapeutically active agent is controlled by the rate of transport through the polymeric matrix, and the biodegradation of the implant. The transport of drug through the polymer barrier will also be affected by compound solubility, polymer hydrophilicity, extent of polymer cross-linking, expansion of the polymer upon water absorption so as to make the polymer barrier more permeable to the drug, geometry of the implant, and the like. The implants are of dimensions commensurate with the size and shape of the region selected as the site of implantation. Implants may be particles, sheets, patches, plaques, fibers, microcapsules and the like and may be of any size or shape compatible with the selected site of insertion.",
                                "The implants may be monolithic, i.e. having the active agent homogenously distributed through the polymeric matrix, or encapsulated, where a reservoir of active agent is encapsulated by the polymeric matrix. The selection of the polymeric composition to be employed will vary with the site of administration, the desired period of treatment, patient tolerance, the nature of the disease to be treated and the like. Characteristics of the polymers will include biodegradability at the site of implantation, compatibility with the agent of interest, ease of encapsulation, a half-life in the physiological environment.",
                                "Biodegradable polymeric compositions which may be employed may be organic esters or ethers, which when degraded result in physiologically acceptable degradation products, including the monomers. Anhydrides, amides, orthoesters or the like, by themselves or in combination with other monomers, may find use. The polymers will be condensation polymers. The polymers may be cross-linked or non-cross-linked. Of particular interest are polymers of hydroxyaliphatic carboxylic acids, either homo- or copolymers, and polysaccharides. Included among the polyesters of interest are polymers of D-lactic acid, L-lactic acid, racemic lactic acid, glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, and combinations thereof. By employing the L-lactate or D-lactate, a slowly biodegrading polymer is achieved, while degradation is substantially enhanced with the racemate. Copolymers of glycolic and lactic acid are of particular interest, where the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the ratio of glycolic to lactic acid. The most rapidly degraded copolymer has roughly equal amounts of glycolic and lactic acid, where either homopolymer is more resistant to degradation. The ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid will also affect the brittleness of in the implant, where a more flexible implant is desirable for larger geometries Among the polysaccharides of interest are calcium alginate, and functionalized celluloses, particularly carboxymethylcellulose esters characterized by being water insoluble, a molecular weight of about 5 kD to 500 kD, etc. Biodegradable hydrogels may also be employed in the implants of the individual instant disclosure. Hydrogels are typically a copolymer material, characterized by the ability to imbibe a liquid. Exemplary biodegradable hydrogels which may be employed are described in Heller in: Hydrogels in Medicine and Pharmacy, N. A. Peppes ed., Vol. I, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1987, pp 137-149."

When plotting the number of microsatellite deletions and fraction of deletions in microsatellite regions (FIGS. 1B and 6A), these values were averaged across the data sources available for each cell line after normalizing for systematic differences between data sources. Specifically, linear regression models were employed to estimate and remove scale and offset differences between data sources so that the normalized number of deletions (and number of deletions in microsatellite regions) measured in each data source was equal on average.

WRN dependency was predicted using MSI status either across all cell lines or within common-MSI lineages only. For comparison analyses, equivalent analysis was performed on several canonical biomarker-dependency relationships: KRAS dependency was predicted by KRAS hotspot missense mutations, BRAF dependency was predicted by BRAF hotspot missense mutations, MDM2 dependency was predicted by TP53 wild-type versus mutant status (including damaging, hotspot missense and other non-silent mutations), PIK3CA dependency was predicted by PIK3CA hotspot missense mutations, ERBB2 dependency was predicted by ERBB2 amplification (log 2(relative copy number)>2), NRAS dependency was predicted by NRAS hotspot missense mutations and CTNNB1 dependency was predicted by APC damaging mutations.",

To estimate the log-fold change (LFC) effect of WRN knockout on each gene in each cell line, the R package Limma (36) was used. Specifically, a linear model was fit for the expression of each gene, using cell line and sgRNA (WRN versus control) as covariates. Read count data were transformed using the Limma function \u2018voom\u2019 prior to model fitting, in order to model the mean-variance relationship of the log(counts) data (40). Fold change effect sizes and empirical-Bayes-moderated t-statistics were then extracted for the WRN knockout effect for each gene and cell line. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (41) was run to test for gene sets that were up- or down-regulated in each cell line after WRN knockout. In particular, the R package fgsea (42) was used to estimate normalized enrichment statistics, and associated p-values, for each gene set in the Hallmark Collection from the Molecular Signatures Database (43).

For cells treated with doxycycline, 0.2 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of doxycycline was added and refreshed every 48 h. Then, 96 h after adding doxycycline, cells were treated with 10 \u03bcg ml\u22121 of colcemid for 3 h and then detached with trypsin. Half of the cell pellet was saved for immunoblot analysis. The other half of the cell pellet was treated with a hypotonic solution (60 mM KCl) and fixed with a 3:1 ratio of methanol:acidic acid. Metaphases were spread onto a slide and fixed with 3% formalin. The PNA-FISH probe ((CCCTAA)3 PNA probe (PNA Bio)) was applied to the slides and denatured at 85\u00b0 C. for 3 min. The slides were washed with washing solution I (70% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5) twice and three times with washing solution II (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5). Cy5-ATTCGTTGGAAACGGGA (SEQ ID NO: 28) was used to label centromeres. Images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and processed with the NISElements BR software. In total, 30 to 60 metaphases were analyzed for cells of the indicated conditions. Two-tailed Student's 1-tests were performed (FIG. 4E). These experiments were performed twice.",

                                "To explore whether MSI and MMR deficiency might create vulnerabilities, and to identify candidate therapeutic targets for cancers that exhibit MSI and MMR deficiency, two independent large-scale cancer dependency datasets were leveraged for information: Project Achilles screened 517 cell lines with a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 library and project DRIVE analyzed 398 cell lines using an RNA interference library to define genes that were selectively essential in cancer cell lines with MSI (10, 11). By comparing essential genes in cell lines with or without specific features such as MSI, these cancer dependency datasets provided an opportunity to identify synthetic lethal interactions (FIG. 1A). MSI status was then determined using next-generation sequencing (12), and the number and fraction of deletions that were located within microsatellite regions were quantified, which thereby identified three groups: MSI, microsatellite stable (MSS) and indeterminate lines (FIG. 1B and Table 2 of priority document U.S. Ser. No. 62/853,412). These classifications were highly concordant with PCR-based MSI phenotyping (13) and with predicted MMR deficiency (FIG. 5A). In total, 51 unique MSI and 541 unique MSS cell lines (excluding those lines marked as indeterminate) were represented by one or both screening datasets.",
                                "Projects Achilles (using CRISPR-Cas9) and DRIVE each independently identified WRN, which encodes a RecQ DNA helicase, as the top preferential dependency in MSI compared to MSS cell lines (Q=4.8\u00d710\u221224 and 1.5\u00d710\u221245, respectively; FIG. 1C. These findings remained true with PCR-based MSI classifications (FIG. 5B). By contrast, none of the four other RecQ DNA helicases were preferentially essential in MSI cell lines (FIG. 5C). MSI was then evaluated as a biomarker for WRN dependency, and it was identified that the MSI-WRN relationship compared favorably to other strong biomarkers for vulnerabilities such as the relationships between activating KRAS and BRAF mutations and KRAS and BRAF dependencies, respectively (FIGS. 1D and 1E).",
                                "MSI is most commonly observed in colorectal, endometrial, gastric and ovarian cancers. MSI cell lines from these four lineages (n=37) showed greater dependence on WRN than their MSS counterparts (n=91; P=4.2\u00d710\u221213, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; FIG. 6A). 14 MSI cell lines were identified from lineages in which MSI was less common (six leukemia lines, two prostate cancer lines and single models of other lineages). However, these MSI cell lines were distinct and contained a median 0.56-fold fewer deletion mutations in microsatellite regions compared to typical lineages (P=1.7\u00d710\u22129; FIG. 6B). The lines from lineages in which MSI was less common were also less dependent on WRN (P=1.1\u00d710\u22125; FIG. 6C), despite possessing events that are predictive of MMR deficiency (Table 2 of priority document U.S. Ser. No. 62/853,412). Correspondingly, the specificity of MSI as a biomarker for WRN dependency was improved by delineating MSI within MSI-predominant lineages (FIGS. 6D and 6E). These observations indicated that WRN dependency is not simply a result of MMR deficiency, but required specific lineages and/or a stronger mutation phenotype. Indeed, WRN dependency correlated with the number of microsatellite deletions within all MSI cell lines and in MSI predominant lineages (Spearman's \u03c1=\u22120.74, n=54, P<2.2\u00d710\u221216; Spearman's \u03c1=\u22120.57, n=37, P=3.3\u00d710\u22124, respectively; FIGS. 6C and 6D).",
                                "To further assess WRN dependency, three single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that targeted WRN were validated using immunoblots (FIG. 7A). WRN knockouts were evaluated in five MSS and five MSI cell lines, all of which were from MSI-predominant lineages, using an eight-day viability assay. Effects of WRN knockout were comparable to \u2018pan-essential\u2019 controls in MSI cell lines. WRN silencing in MSS models instead approximated negative controls, in which intergenic regions were targeted (FIG. 2A). Similarly, WRN depletion impaired the viability of MSI cells despite negligible effects in MSS cells in a 10-day competitive growth assay (FIG. 7B). Complementing these CRISPR-Cas9 data, WRN silencing with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) impaired cell viability in MSI, but not MSS, cells (FIGS. 7C and 7D). To validate that these phenotypes were attributable to WRN inactivation, a sgRNA was developed that targeted a WRN exon-intron junction (WRNEU sgRNA), silencing endogenous WRN, but not exogenous WRN cDNA (FIG. 2B). Correspondingly, WRN cDNA rescued Cas9-expressing KM12 cells from WRNEU sgRNA, but not WRN sgRNA 2, which targets endogenous and exogenous WRN (FIG. 2C). These data demonstrated that the viability loss observed in MSI cells was attributable to WRN inactivation.",
                                "The above findings indicated that WRN dependence with MSI could be exploited by WRN inhibition. WRN functions as both a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease and 3\u2032-5\u2032 helicase in processes such as DNA repair, DNA replication and telomere maintenance (14, 15). To determine which WRN enzymatic function was essential, rescues were attempted of WRN EIJ sgRNA using exonuclease-dead (E84A), helicase-dead (K577M) or dually exonuclease- and helicase-dead (E84A/K577M) versions of WRN cDNA14 in KM12 cells. Exonuclease inactivation did not attenuate rescue, which indicated that this function is dispensable. By contrast, helicase inactivation prevented rescue (FIGS. 2B and 2C), which indicated that the helicase domain is a candidate therapeutic target.",
                                "WRN dependency was then validated in vivo using xenografts of KM12 cells transduced with doxycycline-inducible shRNAs that targeted WRN (WRN shRNA 1) or control (WRN-C911 shRNA 1) in which nucleotides 9-11 of WRN shRNA 1 were mutated to the complementary nucleotides, thus maintaining the \u2018seed\u2019 sequence associated with shRNA off-target effects (16). Induction of WRN shRNA 1 but not WRNC911 shRNA 1 significantly impaired tumor growth (FIG. 2D). Substantial depletion of WRN was observed after induction of WRN shRNA 1 in vivo. However, WRN levels recovered by three weeks (FIG. 2E), mirroring tumor growth recovery, which indicated that WRN re-expression was required to overcome induction of WRN shRNA 1. Further, a shRNA targeting WRN impaired the viability of a newly generated patient-derived organoid obtained from a colon cancer with MSI (FIGS. 2F and 2G). By demonstrating the synthetic lethal relationship in vivo and in a patient-derived model, these data support WRN as a therapeutic target for cancers with MSI.",
                                "To determine the basis of WRN dependency, cell cycle analyses were performed. WRN silencing reduced the proportion of MSI cells in S phase and increased the number of cells in G1 or G2/M phases, which indicated cell cycle arrest at either G1 or G2/M phases (FIGS. 8A and 8B). Furthermore, analyses of annexin V and propidium iodide staining demonstrated the induction of apoptosis and cell death in MSI cells after WRN silencing (FIGS. 8A, 8C, and 8D). By contrast, MSS cell lines showed no significant evidence of increased cell cycle arrest nor cell death after WRN silencing.",
                                "Consistent with the above-described cell cycle and apoptosis assay results, mRNA-sequencing analysis of WRN silencing in MSI cells revealed downregulation of genes associated with G2/M checkpoint progression and E2F target signatures, and upregulated signatures of apoptosis. This analysis additionally revealed p53 activation in MSI-depleted MSI cells (FIG. 3A). Immunofluorescence imaging of proteins in MSI models after WRN silencing showed an increase in phosphorylated (phospho-) p53 (S15), which indicated activation of p53 (17). By contrast, WRN depleted MSS models exhibited substantially weaker changes in phosphor-p53 intensity (P<2\u00d710\u221216, contrast test of mean fold change in MSS versus MSI lines; FIGS. 3B and C, and FIGS. 9A and 9B). WRN depletion in TP53 wild-type MSI cells increased protein levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, another indication of p53 activation. By contrast, there were significantly weaker changes in p21 expression after WRN silencing in MSS and TP53-mutant MSI cells (P<2\u00d710\u221216, fold change in MSI TP53 wild-type versus MSS or TP53-null cells; FIGS. 9C-9F). Based on this result, cell lines were subsequently stratified by both MSI and p53 status. Whereas p53-intact MSI cell lines (n=23) were more sensitive to WRN loss than their p53-impaired (n=13) counterparts (P=0.02, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; MSI cell lines from lineages in which MSI were common only), both wild-type and mutant TP53 MSI cell lines were dependent on WRN (FIG. 9G). These data indicated that although WRN loss led to p53 induction, p53 activity contributed to, but was not solely responsible for, WRN dependence.",
                                "The finding of increased p53 (S15) phosphorylation, a phosphorylation target of DNA-damage response kinases ATR and ATM (17), indicated that WRN loss concomitant with MSI leads to DNA damage. This conclusion is consistent with the roles of p53 and WRN in responding to DNA damage and preserving DNA integrity, respectively (15, 17). Indeed, biallelic germline inactivation of WRN has been described to cause Werner syndrome, which is characterized by premature ageing and an increased incidence of cancer due to impaired DNA damage repair and telomeric shortening, which leads to chromosomal aberrations (15). WRN silencing in MSI, but not MSS, cells led to substantially increased \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci, which are markers of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) (FIGS. 4A-4C and FIGS. 10A-10H). These findings were corroborated by increased formation of phospho-ATM (S1981) foci and CHK2 (T68) phosphorylation, which are indicative of DSB responses that are known to activate p53 and anti-proliferative signaling pathways (18) (FIGS. 11A-11E). \u03b3H2AX expression increased in MSI cells treated with a shRNA against WRN in vitro and in vivo, which demonstrated that DSBs are not just a consequence of CRISPR-Cas9 activity (FIG. 2E and FIG. 11E). These observations also explained why p53-impaired MSI cells were sensitive to WRN depletion, as DSBs are toxic to cells, independent of p53 status (19).",
                                "Given the role of WRN as protective of telomeres (15) it was informative to assess whether a telomere defect precipitated the synthetic lethal relationship observed with WRN silencing. To evaluate chromosomal integrity with WRN silencing, metaphase spreads of two MSI and two MSS cell lines were evaluated with telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 96 h after induction of WRN shRNA 1. WRN silencing induced DSBs and fragmentation throughout chromosomes in MSI cells, but not in MSS cells. However, specific telomeric defects such as increased chromosomal end-to-end fusions or telomeric signal loss were not observed. Although many MSI cells with chromosomal fragmentation were observed after WRN silencing, many MSI cells were also identified in which there were only a few DSBs (FIGS. 4D and 4E, and FIG. 12A). Because this assay required viable cells to cycle into metaphase, these data indicated that DSBs caused the lethal effects of WRN loss and were not merely a consequence of cell death.",
                                "Because the above-described FISH data revealed diffuse DSBs in WRN-depleted MSI cells, it was contemplated that chromosomes required WRN to maintain genomic stability with MSI. Localization of WRN was analyzed using immunofluorescence staining and microscopy. After demonstrating the specificity of WRN immunofluorescence staining (FIG. 12B), predominantly dispersed staining was observed across the nucleoplasm in MSI cells, whereas greater co-localization of WRN with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin (FIGS. 12B-12D) was found. Less nucleoplasmic staining was found in MSS cells. Because WRN has been demonstrated to respond to DNA damage by disseminating from the nucleolus towards the nucleoplasm (20), these data indicated that WRN was recruited to maintain genomic integrity in MSI cells.",
                                "The relationship between MMR deficiency and WRN dependency was subsequently evaluated. It was considered important to determine whether MSI leads to recurrent mutations and inactivation of another gene, creating a dependency on WRN. The second most significant dependency with MSI was RPL22L1, a dependency described in MSI that is attributable to an inactivating mutation of its paralogue, RPL22 (11) (FIG. 1C). The screening dataset was analyzed, and no gene was identified for which a loss could account for the preferential dependency on WRN of cells with MSI (FIG. 13A). Neither was there any increased dependency of WRN identified in cell lines with hypermutations that were due to mutations in polymerase epsilon (POLE) (21) (FIG. 13B and Table 2 of priority document U.S. Ser. No. 62/853,412), which indicated that hypermutability alone did not account for WRN dependency.",
                                "Whether MMR deficiency contributes to WRN dependence was then examined using a model in which MMR activity of the MSI colorectal cell line HCT11 (in which MLH1 and MSH3 are mutated) was restored by introducing chromosomes 3 and 5 (Chr.3+5), which included MLH1 and MSH3, respectively (22) (FIG. 14A). WRN knockdown led to \u03b3H2AX accumulation and impaired viability of parental HCT116 and control cells in which an additional chromosome 2 was introduced. By contrast, Chr.3+5 transfer suppressed DSB accumulation and partially rescued viability from WRN shRNA treatment in a seven-day viability assay (FIG. 4F and FIG. 14B). The rescue was indeed attributable to MMR restoration as CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of MLH1 sensitized HCT116 cells that possess additional Chr.3+5 to WRN silencing and induced DSBs after WRN silencing (FIGS. 14C and 14D). Longer-term clonogenic assays with HCT116 cells established that rescue of WRN dependency is modest with MMR restoration, but abolished with MLH1 knockout (FIGS. 14E and 14F).",
                                "The above-described results indicated that MMR deficiency alone contributed to, but did not fully explain, the synthetic lethal interaction identified herein. The instant findings also indicated that genomic lesions that accumulate with MSI promote WRN dependence. In particular, the potential relevance of accumulation of genomic lesions is consistent with the observation that MSI cells possessing fewer microsatellite deletions were less dependent on WRN. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that accumulating MSI defects could cooperate with MMR deficiency to form genomic structures that require WRN to resolve. Such structures could include insertion-deletion loops (23) and/or displacement loops (D-loops) between homologous DNA sequences (24, 25) which are known substrates for MMR machinery. Indeed, MMR deficiency in yeast has been described to create a dependency on Sgs1, which is a homolog of WRN and BLM, to resolve homologous D-loops that are normally rejected by MMR (26). Beyond the potential role of WRN in preventing DNA damage, loss of WRN in non-homologous end joining and/or homologous recombination could further contribute to the accumulation of DSBs (15). The instant disclosure has therefore revealed that WRN inactivation induced DSBs and activated DSB responses to promote cell death and cell cycle arrest preferentially in MSI cells. Although WRN and other DNA helicases were previously nominated as therapeutic targets (27), the instant disclosure has demonstrated WRN as a synthetic lethal target in cancer cells with MSI, clearly defining a population in which a WRN-based therapeutic can be used. Results presented herein, as well as those of Behan et al. (29), have supported efforts aimed at designing WRN helicase inhibitors to exploit WRN dependency in MSI cancers. More broadly, the instant results highlight the power of large-scale cancer profiling efforts (10-12, 29, 30) to identify cancer vulnerabilities and therapeutic biomarkers, while also illustrating how a cancer dependency map (11, 30) can accelerate the development of precision therapy for patients with cancer."
