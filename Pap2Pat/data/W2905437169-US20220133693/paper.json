    "title": "WRN helicase is a synthetic lethal target in microsatellite unstable cancers",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality\u2014an interaction between two genetic events through which the co-occurrence of these two genetic events leads to cell death, but each event alone does not\u2014can be exploited for cancer therapeutics1. DNA repair processes represent attractive synthetic lethal targets, because many cancers exhibit an impairment of a DNA repair pathway, which can lead to dependence on specific repair proteins2. The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) inhibitors in cancers with deficiencies in homologous recombination highlights the potential of this approach3. Hypothesizing that other DNA repair defects would give rise to synthetic lethal relationships, we queried dependencies in cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from deficient DNA mismatch repair. Here we analysed data from large-scale silencing screens using CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated knockout and RNA interference, and found that the RecQ DNA helicase WRN was selectively essential in MSI models in vitro and in vivo, yet dispensable in models of cancers that are microsatellite stable. Depletion of WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in MSI models. MSI cancer models required the helicase activity of WRN, but not its exonuclease activity. These findings show that WRN is a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target for MSI cancers. Depletion of the DNA helicase WRN induced double-stranded DNA breaks, and promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest selectively in cancers with microsatellite instability, indicating that WRN is a promising drug target for the treatment of these cancers.",

These features were then used to classify each cell line as MSI, MSS, or indeterminate. Unless otherwise indicated, our analysis excluded cell lines classified as 'indeterminate'. When plotting the number of MS deletions and fraction of deletions in MS regions (Fig. 1B, Extended Data Fig. 1a), we averaged these values across the data sources available for each cell line after normalizing for systematic differences between data sources. Specifically, we used linear regression models to estimate and remove scale and offset differences between data sources so that the normalized number of deletions (and number of deletions in MS regions) measured in each data source was equal on average. These normalized average number of MS deletions and fraction of deletions in MS regions are provided in Supplementary Table 1."

A gene was classified as inactivated if any of the above criteria were met, and cell lines where any of these MMR genes were inactivated were classified as having 'MMR loss'. The MMR status for cell lines where we did not have either gene expression or copy number data available were classified as \"NA\". In addition, we annotated MSI cell lines as having low protein expression of MSH2 and MSH6 if they had protein levels < -1 in the RPPA data (Supplementary Table 1). RPPA data were not used for calling MMR loss however, as we were missing RPPA data for many cell lines, and MMR loss was detectable from other omics data in most cases.

                        "Immunofluorescence (IF) was conducted essentially as described previously 45 (except for the double staining for WRN and fibrillarin; see below). Briefly, 2 days after lentiviral transduction, cells were seeded either on an 8-Well Lab-Tek Chamber Slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 177402) or on a 96-Well Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene Microplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 3904). The numbers of cells seeded per well were following: 1\u00d710 6 (5\u00d710 5 ), 1.2\u00d710 6 (6\u00d710 5 ), 1.6\u00d710 6 (8\u00d710 5 ), 6\u00d710 5 (3\u00d710 5 ), and 8\u00d710 5 (4\u00d710 5 ) cells for SW620, KM12, SW48, ES2, and OVK18 cells, respectively [numbers represent seeding densities for 8-well chamber (96-well plate)]. Cells were fixed and stained 2 days later. Micrographic images were acquired using either epifluorescence microscopy (for Figs. 3b; Extended Data Figs. 5a,c,e) or confocal microscopy (for Fig. 4b; Extended Data Figs. 6b,e,g,7a,c), which were performed on an Axio Observer.Z1 microscope equipped with an Axiocam 506 mono camera and Apoptome.2 (Carl Zeiss) and a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal system equipped with Axio Observer (Carl Zeiss), respectively. These confocal microscopy images represent maximum intensity projections of 5 consecutive planes with a step size of 0.08 \u00b5m. For image quantification, images were acquired using an Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System (PerkinElmer, HH14000000) and analyzed on Harmony High Content Imaging and Analysis Software (PerkinElmer, HH17000001). For phospho-p53-, p21-, \u0263H2AXand phospho-ATM-staining, signal intensities in the nucleus of at least 1000 cells/sample were scored on background-subtracted images and presented as box plots. The lower and upper limits of the box plot represent 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively and the bar in the middle of the box represent the median value. The low and high error bars represent 1st and 99th percentiles, respectively. Outliers are represented as dots. To score the patterns of nuclear staining, cells exhibiting mean signal intensity of 12000 or higher (for \u0263H2AX; all cell types) [20,000 or higher for phospho-ATM, except for KM12 and SW48, for which '40,000 or higher' and '10,000 or higher' were used to identify cells with pan-nuclear phosphor-ATM staining patterns, respectively] were first separated as cells with 'pan-nuclear' pattern of staining. For the rest of the cells, the number of foci within the nucleus was scored using a spot-detection program in the software. The relative abundance of cells exhibiting pan-nuclear staining and that of cells harboring specific number of foci were plotted. The number of nuclear foci observed in cells expressing the Apple-53BP1-trunc fluorescent marker were scored similarly (Extended Data Figs. 6f,h). To assess differences between the effects of WRN knockout on IF intensity values in MSI versus MSS cell lines, we used a linear model approach. Specifically, linear models were fit to the log-intensity values with guide and cell line intercept terms. Comparisons of the change in log-intensity after WRN knockout between cell lines were then obtained using the 'contrast' function of the R package lsmeans 46 .",
                        "IF for WRN and fibrillarin was performed as previously described 47 . Images were obtained via the Zeiss LSM510 Upright Confocal System for Extended Data Figs. 8b,c. Weighted Pearson co-localization coefficients were calculated by obtaining Z-stacks of 5 representative high-powered fields at 63x magnification and scored via the Zeiss Zen Blue software. Significance was calculated by two-tailed t-test for MSI cell lines compared to lineage-matched MSS cells (Extended Data Fig. 8d).",
                        "Types of primary antibodies and the dilutions used for immunofluorescence were as follows: anti-\u0263H2AX (Millipore Sigma, 05-636, 1:400); anti-p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-6246, 1:100); anti-phospho ATM [S1981] (Millipore Sigma, 05-740, 1:200); antiphospho Chk2 [T68] (R&D Systems, AF1626, 1:100); anti-fibrillarin (Abcam, ab5821, 1:500); anti-phospho p53 [S15] (Cell Signaling Technology, 9284, 1:100); anti-WRN (Sigma, W0393, 1:200).",

For WRN and fibrillarin IF, Goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11001) and Goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21428) were used at 1:1000 dilution.

Sample size calculation was not performed. For target engagement, one mouse per time point was inoculated in the right and left hand flanks. To compare xenograft tumor growth curves across experimental conditions we used a linear mixed model describing the % increase in tumor volume as a linear function of time, with random slope terms per mouse, and an interaction term between growth rate and experimental condition. Maximum likelihood models were fit using the R package lme4 48 . Reported P values assessing the significance of interactions between growth rate and experimental conditions were derived using a likelihood ratio-test.
