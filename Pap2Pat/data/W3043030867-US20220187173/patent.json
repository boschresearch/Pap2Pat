                        "In recent years, correlative microscopic characterisation methods have attracted great interest in the field of diagnosis and research, thanks above all to the possibility of integrating information coming from different microscopic methods. One of the most interesting techniques is so-called correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), a technology that combines fluorescence microscopy (FM) or light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). This technique enables the extrapolation, from a single sample, of data that are normally not correlatable with one another, thus introducing the possibility of simultaneously comprehending the function and structure of the biological samples analysed in a single experiment. For example, the CLEM technique can be used to obtain the location of specific molecules within a cell and tissue sample to be correlated with information relating to the ultrastructure of the sample. As in the case of biological sample characterisation by \u201cconventional\u201d electron microscopy, the CLEM technique requires that the ultrastructure and contrast be preserved, but at the same time the use of this technique introduces the need to preserve the fluorescence signal of the samples. In order to attain this objective, one of the aspects to be taken into consideration regards the fact that the ultrastructure of the sample must be completely preserved by fixing. Fixing operations are generally based on physical and/or chemical approaches (generally comprising treatment with aldehydes\u2014chemical; or freezing processes\u2014physical) implemented for the purpose of fixing the molecules present in the biological sample in their natural state and in the position in which they are found in vivo, while preventing their decomposition at the same time.",
                        "In the case of the CLEM technique, the optimal fixing approach appears to be high-pressure freezing/substitution of water with an organic solvent at cryogenic temperatures (HPF/FS\u2014high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution). This technique is based on reducing the overall concentration of aldehyde compounds and, by exploiting the cryogenic approach, i.e. a physical fixing method, it enables the fluorescence signal to be preserved while simultaneously maintaining intact the ultrastructure of the biological samples analysed.",
                        "However, this and other similar approaches presently used in the sector do not produce satisfactory results in the case of correlative microscopy, since they do not provide contrast that is sufficient to allow visualisation of the sample by electron microscopy (EM) and necessarily require the presence of contrast agents containing heavy atoms.",
                        "As is well known, in electron microscopy the contrast depends on the atomic number of the atoms present in the sample. The higher the atomic number is, the more scattered the electrons will be and the greater the contrast obtained. Biological molecules are composed of atoms with a very low atomic number (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, etc.) and, for this reason, high concentrations of contrast agents containing heavy metals are generally used.",
                        "In the prior art, the contrast medium (or contrast agent) of reference conventionally used as a contrast medium for biological samples in electron microscopy is uranyl acetate. However, the radioactive nature of uranyl acetate and the derivatives thereof causes severe restrictions from a safety standpoint. Furthermore, the delivery and disposal of uranyl acetate derivatives is extremely costly due to the increasingly strict regulations they are subject to.",
                        "Furthermore, this type of contrast agent is unsuitable for optical microscopy and thus also for correlative microscopy, due both to an ample background (auto)fluorescence in the red and green region of the spectrum and the quenching action of the majority of synthetic and protein-based fluorophores on the fluorescence signal.",
                        "On the basis of these considerations, it is clear that the use of traditional contrast agents based on uranyl acetate has two opposite effects on the sample: on the one hand, it enables better visualisation in the case of electron microscopy, on the other hand it negatively influences the optical detection of fluorescence, thus inhibiting the possibility of carrying out correlative microscopy experiments.",
                        "Nonetheless, to date uranyl acetate remains the contrast agent most commonly used also for correlative purposes, even though it is not optimal for this technique, as it must be used in relatively high concentrations which, because of the high background signal, are not fully compatible with fluorescence-based techniques. In this regard, in the present state of the art, the most commonly used expedient is to maintain the concentration of the contrast agent as low as possible, to the detriment, however, of sample contrast, since it is known that uranyl acetate (UA) does not provide satisfactory results if used at low concentrations.",
                        "As regards the presently commercially available contrast media that are alternatives to uranyl acetate (such as, for example, \u201cUranyless\u201d, \u201c336 uranyl acetate alternative\u201d, \u201cNanoW\u201d and \u201cplatinum blue\u201d), although they enable the problem of handling radioactive materials to be overcome, they perform poorly in terms of contrast efficiency and their use is thus even more disadvantageous in the case of correlative microscopy.",
                        "Therefore, there is a strongly felt need in the sector to identify contrast media that are suitable both in the case of conventional electron microscopy and correlative microscopy, and above all to identify contrast media that are not derived from depleted uranium and show a greater contrast efficiency than the uranyl acetate used until now, but which can at the same time give satisfactory results in fluorescence microscopy and thus also be used in correlative microscopy experiments.",
                        "Biological sample contrast and negative contrast procedures using substances other than uranyl acetate and the analogues thereof (for example, uranyl formate) have been studied and developed since the beginning of the 1970s. The procedures currently most widely used as alternatives to uranyl acetate are described in the publication Basic techniques for transmission electron microscopy (M. A. Hayat, Academic Press, 1986) and are mainly based on the use of transition metals.",
                        "Possible contrast media that can substitute for uranyl acetate and have properties similar to that compound have recently been the subject of study. For example, in the study New versatile staining reagents for biological transmission electron microscopy that substitute for uranyl acetate. Nakatoshi et al. Journal of Electron Microscopy 60(6): 401-407 (2011), the authors tested samarium and gadolinium in the form of acetate salts for contrasting both animal samples and plant samples, since the dimensions of these two elements in terms of atomic radius are similar to those of uranium. In the discussion of the results, it is stated that the tested compounds could be excellent substitutes for uranyl acetate in thin section contrast (post-sectioning staining), but, as regards contrast efficiency, they provided only fair results. Furthermore, the tested compounds demonstrated to be devoid of the fixative properties of uranyl acetate.",
                        "In order to improve the contrasting capability of the tested compounds, the authors suggest the inclusion of supplementary substances that could have a positive influence. However, in the prior art it is difficult to identify substances which, when added to lanthanide salts, are capable of forming chemically stable solutions with a low chemical risk and which make it possible to obtain better images, at least as far as electron microscopy is concerned, or at least ones that are comparable to those obtainable with uranyl acetate. In this regard, phosphotungstic acid (abbreviated with the acronym PTA) has very often been used with good results in optical microscopy as a stain in combination with other substances, as is reported, for example, in patent application GB2372811. In this document, PTA is used in an alcoholic solution combined with eosin or synthetic azo dyes, but in no case with lanthanides or salts thereof. Considering, on the other hand, the use of PTA in contrast techniques in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the scientific publication Examination of electron stains as a substitute for uranyl acetate for the ultrathin sections of bacterial cells. Tgamuchu et al. Journal of Electron Microscopy 59(2): 113-118 (2010) reports a comparative study between PTA and other contrast agents that are alternatives to uranyl acetate. From this study it emerges that none of the tested compounds (namely, in addition to PTA, platinum blue, oolong tea extract and potassium permanganate) provide contrast results comparable to those of uranyl acetate. In particular, PTA provided low quality images in tests with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.",
                        "Patent WO2017/017428 relates to the preparation of samples, in particular histological samples, for the characterisation thereof by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In particular, this publication envisages the possibility of incorporating a secondary electron generator (such as, for example, a compound selected from among AlCl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, CrCl3, GaCl3, YCl3, MoCl3, AgCl, InCl3, SbCl3, HfCl3, TaCl3, WCl3, OsCl3, IrCl3, AuCl, HauCl4, HgCl2, CeCl3, NdCl3 and ErCl3) and possibly a contrast agent (such as, for example, phosphotungstic acid, phosphomolybdic acid, lanthanum nitrate and/or a combination thereof) into the sample to be analysed, for the purpose of increasing the resolution of the images obtained by electron microscopy. Said patent also envisages the possibility of incorporating a self-healing material in order to reduce the possible collateral damage caused to the sample during imaging.",
                        "None of these alternatives, however, have yet been thoroughly tested in the field of correlative microscopy, since, as mentioned previously, the contrast agents presently available for electron microscopy are not always suitable for an optimal implementation of the CLEM technique. In fact, an ideal contrast agent in this field must be able to completely preserve the contrast also at relatively low concentrations, while at the same time enabling an excellent sensitivity in fluorescence measurements.",
                        "The present invention solves this problem by providing a solution based on lanthanide salts and heteropolyacids and a use thereof as a contrast solution both in correlative microscopy (CLEM) and in conventional electron microscopy (EM).",
                        "The Applicant has in fact found that by combining lanthanide salts with heteropolyacids, which are generally used in optical microscopy, but at the same time considered to perform poorly in electron microscopy, it is possible to obtain a contrast efficiency that is not only comparable to that of the standard uranyl acetate, but even better.",
                        "The Applicant has thus developed a new contrast agent comprising a heteropolyacid and a lanthanide salt in a suitable water/organic solvent mixture or an organic solvent, which benefits from a synergistic effect between the aforesaid ingredients. The surprising results obtained demonstrate that the contrast solution of the present invention not only provides better results than other contrast solutions that are alternatives to uranyl acetate, but even surpasses the performance of uranyl acetate itself in terms of contrast efficiency, while maintaining a good level of the signal in fluorescence images. In fact, the better efficiency of the contrast solution of the present invention enables its use also in low concentrations, thus preserving the possibility of characterisation by correlative microscopy.",
                        "The solution of the present invention can thus substitute for the commercial alternatives presently available on the market of contrast agents for both correlative CLEM characterisation and EM characterisation, and furthermore represents an economical alternative to the uranyl acetate-based contrast agents presently on the market."
