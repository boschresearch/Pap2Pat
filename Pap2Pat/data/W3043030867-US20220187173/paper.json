    "title": "Uranium-free X solution: a new generation contrast agent for biological samples ultrastructure",
    "date": "2020-07-14",
    "abstract": "Biological samples are mainly composed of elements with a low atomic number which show a relatively low electron scattering power. For Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis, biological samples are generally embedded in resins, which allow thin sectioning of the specimen. Embedding resins are also composed by light atoms, thus the contrast difference between the biological sample and the surrounding resin is minimal. Due to that reason in the last decades, several staining solutions and approaches, performed with heavy metal salts, have been developed with the purpose of enhancing both the intrinsic sample contrast and the differences between the sample and resin. The best staining was achieved with the uranyl acetate (UA) solution, which has been the election method for the study of morphology in biological samples. More recently several alternatives for UA have been proposed to get rid of its radiogenic issues, but to date none of these solutions has achieved efficiencies comparable to UA. In this work, we propose a different staining solution (X Solution or X SOL), characterized by lanthanide polyoxometalates (LnPOMs) as heavy atoms source, which could be used alternatively to UA in negative staining (NS), in en bloc staining, and post sectioning staining (PSS) of biological samples. Furthermore, we show an extensive chemical characterization of the LnPOM species present in the solution and the detailed work for its final formulation, which brought remarkable results, and even better performances than UA.",

                "Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is an established pillar in ultrastructural analysis of biological samples, with countless applications both in research and clinical environment. Biological specimens are formed by light atoms therefore the local tiny density variations should be enhanced to give a detectable contrast in electron micrographs. This is usually achieved by using heavy metals as staining agent1. In this field, uranyl acetate (UA) solution has been considered as the gold standard for electron microscopy (EM) characterization, due to its low cost, the very high contrast provided and its intrinsic affinity for biological samples2.",
                "Recently, however, the mildly radioactive nature of Uranium-derivatives raised considerable regulatory issues for their use (such as health, availability, price, storage, and disposal). These factors raised an increasing interest in developing safer, more effective alternatives to UA, and several uranium-free staining solutions have been proposed3\u20137.",
                "However, to date, UA is still considered, by electron microscopists working in TEM biology, as the best choice as staining solution.",
                "In the framework of our long-lasting research activity on EM and lanthanide-based chemistry, we sought to develop a novel contrast agent that could provide improved results compared with UA, without its limitation of toxicity and radioactivity.",
                "To this end, among the elements of lanthanide family, we focused on Ytterbium, which shows a very high electron scattering power, because of the contraction of its electronic shell. Lanthanide salts were recently described for their use in TEM4, but they usually provide unsatisfactory results due to their low and rather unspecific binding capability. To address this issue, we envisaged a different approach that could combine: (1) typical selectivity of contrast agents, (2) enhanced contrast. This could ultimately lead to a synergistic effect that allows an improved visualization of subtle details usually characterized by very low-contrast.",
                "UA, for example, has been used together with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) exploiting a multiple staining method (MSM) strategy, because the first shows a higher affinity for acid compounds while the last for basic ones. To improve affinity of Yb3+ towards biological samples, we decided to investigate its combined use with PTA in an MSM approach.",
                "In the literature, PTA is described as staining agent for TEM8, and in particular for negative staining (NS) experiments, although the contrast provided is often not satisfactory, due to the low atomic weight of Tungsten. However, there are several reports of strong interaction between PTA and lanthanide salts9, thus we envisioned that an appropriate combination of the two components could merge advantages of both reagents, leading to a more effective staining.",
                "In this work, we describe our results in the rational development of X Solution, an innovative staining agent based on a pH buffered Yb3+/PTA mixture, and we show how, under optimized conditions, our staining agent significantly improves upon the staining efficiency of UA, in en bloc staining as well as in NS, and post sectioning staining (PSS) procedures."

                        "We started our investigation with a study of complexation process between PTA and Yb salts. The aqueous solution chemistry of PTA is remarkably rich, characterized by the presence of different molecular species, originating from phophotungstate [PW12O40]3\u2212 anion by association or loss of fragments (mainly W=O units or tungstate WO42\u2212) as a function of pH and/or presence of organic solvents (ethanol, acetone)10. Interestingly, phosphorus NMR (31P-NMR) (altogether with 183W-NMR) has been extensively used to monitor the dissociation of PTA or its complexation with metallic cation in water solution10,11. Among others, lanthanide trivalent ions complexation with PTA to form LnPOMs has already been object of different studies, considering the strong oxophilicity of Ln ions and their ability to bind donor atoms following different regular or distorted geometries12.",
                        "PTA showed its typical 31P-NMR spectrum (water/ethanol 80/20 v/v), characterized by the \u2212\u00a015\u00a0ppm signal of [PW12O40]3\u2212 specie at low pH (1\u20133), and by the unique \u2212\u00a010.8\u00a0ppm resonance for the monolacunary [PW11O39]7\u2212 specie from slightly acidic to neutral pH (4\u20137) (Supplementary Fig. S1)10,11.",

                        "The PTA complexation with YbCl3 salt was followed by 31P-NMR (Fig.\u00a01A) and ICP-MS: upon addition of Yb3+ salt to a 3.2\u00a0mM solution of PTA at pH\u2009=\u20094.7 (water/ethanol 80/20 v/v), we observed the disappearance of the \u2212\u00a010.8\u00a0ppm signal of the monolacunary specie, to be replaced after the addition of 1 equivalents of Yb3+ with a unique 27\u00a0ppm resonance. This 1:1 stoichiometry specie remained unaltered upon addition of an excess of lanthanide, which solely determined the precipitation of a white solid identified as Yb(HWO4)3 (WO42\u2212 pKa2\u2009=\u20093.5)13. The 27\u00a0ppm resonance is always present in a pH\u2009=\u20092\u20137 (Fig.\u00a01B, C) value span, even if at low pH altogether with the \u2212\u00a015\u00a0ppm uncomplexed [PW12O40]3\u2212 (Fig.\u00a01C). The remarkable chemical shift variation from \u2212\u00a010.8 to 27\u00a0ppm, as a result of the complexation, is due to the paramagnetism of Yb3+ close in space to the phosphorus atom, and, interestingly, it seemed to be in line with already reported Yb/PTA complexes14,15 of different stoichiometry: while in literature are mainly present examples of Yb/PTA 1:2 species with one or two 31P-NMR resonances, depending on the symmetry of the system, in our case the 1:1 stoichiometry is unquestionable (with 0.5 equivalents of Yb3+ there is also the presence of a 34\u00a0ppm resonance of the 1:2 complex) and the identity of the LnPOMs has been undoubtedly confirmed by ICP-MS as the [YbPW9O34]6\u2212 (sodium salt) complex of Yb3+ with the trilacunary [PW9O34]9\u2212 species. The reaction in basic condition was not investigated due to the known decomposition of the PTA ensemble and precipitation of the lanthanide oxide/hydroxide.Figure 1NMR study of complex formation and stability: (a) 31P-NMR titration of PTA with increasing amounts of YbCl3.

As already mentioned, both lanthanide salts and PTA have been individually used in TEM, thus a certain degree of staining could be expected3\u20138.",
                        "We then evaluated the best molar ratio between YbCl3 and PTA in terms of staining efficiency (Supplementary Fig. S3). Only one species containing Phosphorus appears in solution in all YbCl3/PTA molar ratios greater than 1 (Fig.\u00a01B). However, we observed a striking dependence of staining efficiency on the excess of YbCl3 (Supplementary Fig. S3A, B). Indeed, X Solution shows the best efficiency when YbCl3/PTA molar ratio is 15:1, while contrast is poorer than UA for ratios lower than 10:1. Higher ratios than 15:1 lead to salt precipitation and hence increasing the background.",
                        "A possible explanation of the contrast increase could be the accumulation of Yb3+ ions on a single PTA molecule after the interaction of the latter with the biological specimen. The consequent Yb3+ accumulation induces a significant improvement of the contrast.",
                        "A confirmation of this accumulation process is provided by the fact that a better contrast is achieved when PTA and YbCl3 are added in this order to the specimen rather than if the reagents (i.e. YbCl3 and PTA) are added in reverse order. Interestingly the contrast achieved by adding the two reagents one after the other in any of the two combinations is remarkably worse than the one obtained with the preformed X Solution.",
                        "Moreover, we observed that X Solution can be kept for a longer time (with respect to the single components) without suffering variation of pH or reduction of staining efficiency. Furthermore, for routinely analysis, the use of a single solution is easier and faster.",
                        "Finally, we observed that increasing the incubation time from 30\u00a0min to 1\u00a0h leads to improved contrast; this timing was thus chosen as the standard incubation time for all subsequent experiments of en bloc staining during the embedding procedure. The results of the comparison between the staining efficiency of the optimized X Solution (ratio 15:1), PTA 3.2\u00a0mM, YbCl3 48\u00a0mM alone and UA 3% (all in water/ethanol 80/20 v/v) is summarized in Fig.\u00a02. It is evident that X Solution provides a far better contrast compared with the use of either single components or UA at the same concentration.Figure 2PTA and YbCl3 synergy: (a) EM micrographs of Mia PaCa-2 cells stained with UA 3% solution, X SOL, PTA 3.2\u00a0mM, YbCl3 48\u00a0mM (all solutions are made in water/ethanol 80/20 v/v); (b) quantitative analysis of the staining efficiency on Mia PaCa-2 cells.",
                        "In fact, both PTA and YbCl3 did not show any concentration-dependent contrast improvement in the 3\u20135% w/w range (data not shown). The worse performance achieved with single components can be explained by the poor YbCl3 selectivity, which leads to unspecific staining, and by poor PTA contrast, due to the relatively low atomic number (i.e. electron density) of tungsten. The combination of the two leads to a synergistic effect that translates in an impressive 48% contrast increase compared with benchmark contrast agent UA 3% (Fig.\u00a02B).",
                        "A good contrast in EM is basically due to the combination of selective adsorption and efficient scattering of the electron beam. Uranyl acetate has an intrinsically higher efficiency compared with lanthanides in terms of electrondensity due to its atomic weight and reasonable affinity towards proteins, thus acting both as staining and binding agent. Our X Solution shows a great contrast improvement, due to the enhanced and cleaner interaction with biologic tissue typical of PTA8,16, which is also able to localize an Yb deposition around biological features.",
                        "We then moved towards a further refinement of the production process of our X Solution. To this end, we tried to address the main potential issue in the routine use of this contrast agent, i.e. pH stability over time. As mentioned, the preparation process of X Solution requires tightly controlled pH conditions. However, an unbuffered system does not guarantee pH stability over the time, and stability studies performed on unbuffered solutions showed a pH decrease of 0.8 units within 13\u00a0days. We also demonstrated that such pH variations correspond to variation in the stability of the active compound.",
                        "Thus, we screened commonly used buffers (sodium cacodylate, 4-Morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES), citrate, ammonium acetate) to find the most appropriate to preserve the active species considering their optimal buffering capacity at pH typically used in conventional staining procedures for EM. NMR monitored the effect of adding the buffer to the active species. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4A, in two cases (sodium Cacodylate and ammonium acetate) the active species was not observed in solution, while MES seems to fully preserve functionality regardless of buffer concentration in the examined range (0\u201340\u00a0mM) (Fig.\u00a03C and Supplementary Fig. S4A).Figure 3Buffering: (a) EM micrographs of gastrocnemius muscle stained with UA 3% solution or X SOL (upper line). The staining seems much more uniform in UA 3% stained samples compared to X SOL stained one; higher magnification of X SOL stained muscle (boxed lower line) shows that differences in contrast is due to the contraction status of myofibers, thus discriminating between relaxed and contracted ones; (b) Quantitative analysis of the staining efficiency performed on Mia PaCa-2 cells; (c) 31P-NMR analysis of X SOL w/wo the addition of MES buffer.",
                        "The same effect on the active species stabilization was observed using sodium citrate, which however does have solubility issues and was not further considered. These findings have an impact on the staining efficiency which is optimal in the case of MES buffered solutions (Fig.\u00a03A, B) and detrimental when the active species is not present (i.e. in solutions buffered with ammonium acetate or sodium cacodylate, Supplementary Fig. S4B). Moreover, our results indicate that X Solution, buffered with 20\u00a0mM MES, was stable for not less than one year."

In cells stained with X Solution we observed a very strong definition of these clathrin coated structures (CCS) with respect to the neighboring regions not involved in endocytosis. Moreover, we noted that the remarkable contrast we obtained with our staining led us to the unequivocal identification of the three mentioned domains. In our hands, this might suggest that the enrichment in phosphate groups around CCS, is the vehicle for a proper staining through the interaction either with PTA or YbCl3.",

We found that there is a clear influence of lanthanide salt specifically on the signal of monobutylphosphate, which broadens upon addition of the lanthanide. This effect can be attributed to the interaction of the monoester phosphate with the Yb paramagnetic ion accompanied by a partial precipitation of complexed monobutylphosphate. This could explain the observed efficient staining of phosphorylated proteins in TEM. Note that a minor but not negligible contribution must arise from phosphate head groups in lipids."

This staining agent outperforms other uranium-free staining solutions and favorably compares even with gold standard uranyl acetate (Supplementary Fig. S7). The observed contrast improvement, that can reach almost 50% compared with uranyl acetate, allows improved evaluation of biologic details, and could ease, in perspective, automated pattern recognition by image processing algorithms. Finally, the absence of radioactive material in our contrast agent makes it sensibly less toxic compared with the mildly radioactive uranium acetate. Thus, its use allows overcoming current complications and cost increases due to acquisition, handling, and disposal of radioactive substances, ultimately making X solution more attractive also from a cost/effectiveness perspective."
