# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present disclosure relates to use of a Chaetomium globosum strain in controlling Fusarium crown rot (FCR) of wheat.

## BACKGROUND

Fusarium crown rot (FCR), an important root and crown rot of wheat, can reduce grain weight per ear and 1,000-grain weight. The disease can infect at the seedling, tillering, jointing and adult stages of wheat. Typical symptoms include the browning of the base of the wheat stem to appear the color of soy sauce, and scattered white ears appeared in the field during the filling stage.

Currently, there are no control agents effective against FCR of wheat. Use of the existing chemical agents not only destroy the soil micro-ecological environment and aggravate environmental pollution, but some seed-dressing agents also delay the seeding stage of wheat and affect the emergence. Therefore, the focus of disease control has gradually shifted to biological and agricultural control measures. In the field of crop plant protection, one of the important means in biological control research is to use rhizosphere soil of healthy crop plants to select soil microorganisms with significant biocontrol effects on pathogens and prepare microbial inoculants, and the means is an important way to develop and utilize beneficial microbial resources. Chaetomium species are widely distributed in soil and plants. Such microorganisms can produce a variety of antibiotics such as chaetocin and chaetoglobosin, and are widely studied as biocontrol inoculants for plant pathogens. At present, there is no report about the use of isolated C. globosum strain in controlling FCR of wheat.

## SUMMARY

The present disclosure provides use of a C. globosum strain in controlling FCR of wheat. Field experiments conclude that after coating of wheat seeds with Chaetomium. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3, diseased stem rate, disease rating, and disease index are reduced by 19-41.3%, 43.7%, and 4.7-45.4%, respectively.

At the wheat filling stage, uninfected plants were collected from a field with take-all of wheat in Xiping County, Henan Province, and packed in paper bags. The samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4° C. The roots of the samples were rinsed; 2-3 cm wheat root tissue was sampled, surface disinfected with 75 wt % absolute ethanol for 10-30 s and 1% NaClO for 1.5 min, and rinsed with sterile water thrice; after blotting up water with sterile filter paper, the wheat root tissue was cut into small sections of about 0.5 cm, and placed on a potato dextrose agar medium (PDA, raw material composition: peeled potato 300 g, dextrose 20 g, agar 20 g, and distilled water 1,000 ml) plate with sterile tweezers; after culturing at 20° C. for 5-7 days, marginal hyphae were picked to grow on a new PDA plate. After 5-7 days under the same conditions, hyphal pellets with uniform colonies were picked, cultured on PDA slant, and stored at 4° C.

### Example 2

DNA Extraction of C. globosum Strain 12XP1-2-3

C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3 was picked on a PDA medium, and cultured at 20° C. for 5-7 days; five marginal hyphal pellets were picked and placed evenly on a PDA plate covered with sterilized cellophane. After 3-5 days, hyphae were scraped with a small sterilized iron shovel, quick-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored in a refrigerator at −20° C. When extracting DNA, 20-25 mg of hyphae were taken out into a pre-cooled 1.5 ml EP tube; a little liquid nitrogen was added, and the hyphae were ground into a powder using a pre-cooled iron nail in the EP tube; 500 μl of Extraction Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 100 mM EDTA (8.0)) was added, pellets were shaken, suspended and mixed well on a vortex shaker; subsequently, the pellets were mixed with 25 μl of preheated (20 wt %) sodium dodecyl sulfonate, inverted to mix well, and placed in a 37° C. water bath for 1-3 h; subsequently, the mixture was mixed with 75 μl of 5 M NaCl, and inverted to mix well; the mixture was mixed with 65 μl of CTAB/NaCl (10% CTAB and 0.7 M NaCl) solution, and placed in a 65° C. water bath for 30 min; the mixture was mixed well with an equal volume (700 μl) of Tris-phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) mixture and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 4° C. for 10 min, and a supernatant (550 μl) was transferred to another EP; the supernatant was mixed with 0.6 times volume of pre-cooled isopropanol (330 μl), pelleted at −20° C. for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm and 4° C. for 10 min, a supernatant was discarded; the pellets were washed twice with 70 wt % ethanol, and air-dried on a clean bench for 5-10 min; the dried pellets were dissolved in an appropriate amount of sterile ddH2O and stored at −20° C.

Molecular Identification of C. globosum Strain 12XP1-2-3

In this experiment, primers ITS1 (5′-TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3′) were used to amplify DNA fragments containing ITS1, 5.8S rDNA and ITS2 in the test strain. For the system, refers to Daval et al. (2010) Amplification conditions were as follows: PCR program was: 95° C. for 3 min; 35 cycles of 95° C. for 45 s, 50° C. for 30 s, and 72° C. for 1 min; 72° C. for 10 min. After PCR products were sequenced, BLAST sequence alignment analysis was performed in NCBI. The sequence alignment result concluded that the biocontrol inoculant 12XP1-2-3 was C. globosum.

### Example 4

Plate Antagonistic Effect of C. globosum Strain 12XP1-2-3 on F. pseudograminearum

The C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3 was picked with a sterile toothpick and activated on a PDA; the culture condition was 25° C. on 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. The wheat crown rot fungus G14LY24-2 was activated on a PDA; the culture condition was 25° C. without light. When colonies were close to the edge of a Petri dish (7 days later), a puncher with an inner diameter of 0.5c m was used to beat the edges of the colonies of C. globosum and wheat crown rot fungus into a plurality of mycelium discs. Two sections were marked 2.5 cm away from the center of the PDA Petri dish; mycelium discs of C. globosum and wheat crown rot fungus were placed at the marked points, respectively, with a distance of 5 cm between both centers; only a mycelium disc of wheat crown rot fungus was placed in the blank control, and cultured at 25° C. without light. Three days later, the growth of the wheat crown rot fungus was determined by streaking. The results are shown in FIG. 1. The results showed that the inhibition rate of the C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3 against the F. pseudograminearum G14LY24-2 on the plate was 30.3%.

### Example 5

Field Effect of Seed Coating with C. globosum Strain 12XP1-2-3 on Controlling FCR of Wheat

1. Field Control Effect of C. globosum on FCR of Wheat

1.1. Culture of Inoculum of F. Pseudograminearum

Wheat grains are soaked for 12 h, sterilized for 60 min, allowed to stand for two days, sterilized for 30-60 min, and cooled for later use. Fusarium pseudograminearum G14LY24-2 was selected on a PDA plate. After growing for three days, marginal hyphae were picked to grow on a fresh PDA plate. After three days, the hyphal pellets were plated into a wheat grain polyethylene bag with sterilized wheat grains. The hyphal pellets grew at room temperature for two weeks until the fungi grew all over wheat grains, and stored in a refrigerator at 4° C. after air-drying.

1.2. Construction of Field Disease Nurseries

Disease nurseries were constructed in a 1:1 ratio of seed quantity to inoculum volume ratio. The inoculation was located 3-5 cm above the seed. The seeds to be sown and the inoculum were mixed first, and after mixing well, well-mixed sowing materials were sown by a planter.

1.3. Seed Coating with C. globosum

Selected C. globosum strains were activated on a fresh PDA, and hyphal pellets were picked into 9 cm PDA Petri dishes. After 15 days, perithecia were ground in sterile water using a spreading rod, and ascospore suspension was controlled at about 100 mL, with a concentration of 1.0-2.0×107 ascospores/mL; in case of a low concentration, the suspension was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, dewatered, and resuspended. 75 mL of fungal suspension (approximately 1.3×107 ascospores/mL) was mixed with 25 mL of 4 wt % carboxymethyl cellulose salt solution into 100 mL of fungal suspension with 1% carboxymethyl cellulose salt (approximately 1.0×107 ascospores/mL). 100 mL of 1×107 ascospores/mL fungal suspension with 1% carboxymethyl cellulose salt was mixed well with 5 kg of wheat seeds. Chaetomium globosum strain 12XP1-2-3-coated seeds were rinsed and spread on a plate to count spores on the seed surface, which was 5.0-5.3×104 ascospores per seed. The wheat cultivar in 2018 was “Bainong 207”, the wheat cultivar in 2019 was “Aikang 58”, the control agent was 30 g/L difenoconazole, and the seeds were dressed in an agent-to-seed ratio of 1:333.

1.4. Data Investigation and Recording

Field sampling method: At the seedling stage, the emergence rate was investigated, and the plant height, tap root length, fresh weight, dry weight, and colonization ability of C. globosum were measured; at the tillering stage, the morbidity was investigated, and the plant height, tap root length, fresh weight, dry weight, tiller number, and colonization ability of C. globosum were measured; the morbidity was investigated at the jointing stage; the white ear rate was investigated at the filling stage. The method was to investigate the number of white heads and total number of ears per 1 m2 plot and calculate the white ear rate of the plot. The diseased stem rate was investigated at the maturing stage; 20 stems were sampled at five points in each plot, a total of 100 stems for each treatment were brought back to the laboratory, and leaf sheaths were removed thoroughly to determine the disease rating.

The grading standard for adult stage was as follows: 0=no disease; 1=browning in the first node; 2=browning in the second node; 3=browning in the third node; 4=browning in the peduncle or white ears at the filling stage; and 5=diseased plant without ear bearing. The yield was determined during harvest. The results are shown in Table 2.

As can be seen from Table 2, according to the investigation at the filling stage, the wheat cultivar in 2018 is “Bainong 207”, in the control treatment, the diseased stem rate is 57.8%, and the average disease rating is 0.7; for the seed coating with C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3, the diseased stem rate and the average disease rating are 33.9% and 0.7, respectively; the wheat cultivar in 2019 is “Aikang 58”, in the control treatment, the diseased stem rate is 50.4%, and the average disease rating is 1.6; for the seed coating with C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3, the diseased stem rate and the average disease rating are 40.8% and 1.6, respectively.

It is suggested that coating of seeds with the C. globosum strain 12XP1-2-3 provided by the present disclosure can not only reduce the white head rate, but also lower the disease rating and disease index.
