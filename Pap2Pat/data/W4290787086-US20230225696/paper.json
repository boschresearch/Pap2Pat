    "abstract": "Doppler echocardiography plays a central role in the assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PAH). We aim to improve quality assessment of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP) by applying a cubic polynomial interpolation to digitized tricuspid regurgitation (TR) waveforms. Patients with PAH and advanced lung disease were divided into three cohorts: a derivation cohort ( n = 44), a validation cohort ( n = 71), an outlier cohort ( n = 26), and a non\u2010PAH cohort ( n = 44). We digitized TR waveforms and analyzed normalized duration, skewness, kurtosis, and first and second derivatives of pressure. Cubic polynomial interpolation was applied to three physiology\u2010driven phases: the isovolumic phase, ejection phase, and \u201cshoulder\u201d point phase. Coefficients of determination and a Bland\u2212Altman analysis was used to assess bias between methods. The cubic polynomial interpolation of the TR waveform correlated strongly with expert read right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) with R 2 > 0.910 in the validation cohort. The biases when compared to invasive SPAP measured within 24 h were 6.03 [4.33; 7.73], \u22122.94 [1.47; 4.41], and \u22123.11 [\u22124.52; \u22121.71] mmHg, for isovolumic, ejection, and shoulder point interpolations, respectively. In the outlier cohort with more than 30% difference between echocardiographic estimates and invasive SPAP, cubic polynomial interpolation significantly reduced underestimation of RVSP. Cubic polynomial interpolation of the TR waveform based on isovolumic or early ejection phase may improve RVSP estimates.",

                "Doppler echocardiography (echo) of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet plays a central role in the noninvasive assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). 1 In 1984, Yock and Popp 2 showed Doppler derived estimation of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was strongly associated with invasive measurements with only a minimal bias. While its value is well recognized, more recent studies have questioned the reliability of noninvasive Doppler estimation of RVSP via peak regurgitant velocity (Vmax) 3 . For example, Fisher et al. 4 found 48% of cases had an assessment error of greater than 10 mmHg. As shown by other studies, however, reliability may be significantly improved by estimation of Vmax at the modal frequency and by avoiding interpretation of incomplete TR waveforms. 5,6 A better understanding of the Doppler TR waveform could provide additional quality control for estimation of Vmax and therefore RVSP.",
                "While the shape of the TR waveform has generally been described as parabolic or triangular, 7 few studies have mathematically analyzed the underlying TR curvature. In right heart catheterization (RHC) measurements, Vanderpool et al. 8 recently highlighted how first and second derivatives of the RVSP waveform can be useful in identifying isovolumic contraction, ejection, and isovolumic relaxation.",
                "The third-degree polynomial method (cubic spline) allows interpolation of skewed curves and is commonly used in the engineering field to achieve smooth boundaries. To add confidence in maximal pressure (Pmax) estimation, we coupled the method with physiologically relevant points of the TR waveform such as start and end of isovolumic phases or of ejection phase.",
                "This study had three main objectives to define the conceptual framework of TR waveform analysis. First, we analyzed the TR waveform and its relationship with physiological metrics including but not limited to right ventricular (RV) longitudinal strain, TR severity, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and heart rate. Second, we derived and validated the cubic polynomial interpolation method of estimating RVSP from different phases of the cardiac cycle. Finally, we determined whether cubic polynomial interpolation could improve estimation of RVSP in a cohort with greater bias between RVSP estimation from echo and RHC."

Second, cubic polynomial interpolation using isovolumic or early ejection phases (including shoulder) provided reliable interpolation of maximal RVSP. If further implemented, interpolation methods may provide additional quality control for RVSP estimates to inform diagnosis of PH (Figure 7)."

                        "In clinical guidelines, the TR curve shape is often described as parabolic or triangular. 7,15 Our study, however, highlights the non-parabolic shape of the TR waveform with variable skewness. As we have shown, skewness appears to be more closely associated with normalized TR duration which itself depends on RV systolic function and PVR. Previous studies have highlighted the value of normalized TR duration in pulmonary arterial hypertension especially in pediatric population. 8,16,17 In the study of Cho et al., 18 normalized TR duration in CMR is closely related to RV ejection fraction and is proven to be associated with outcome in PAH. One of the additional original contributions of our study is to demonstrate that, in echo, normalized TR duration also depends on RV longitudinal strain which is also a strong prognostic marker in PAH."

                        "Estimation of RVSP plays a central role in the assessment of PH. Typically, we can approach confidence of RVSP estimation either by signal quality (modal frequency and completeness of waveform) or through physiological correlates of RVSP with pulmonary pressures. For signal quality, recent studies by Kiranis et al. 19 and Amsallem et al. 5 point to the importance of estimating peak TR velocity at the modal frequency (estimation at the \"chin\" and not the \"beard\" of the signal). For physiological consideration, Chemla et al. 20 showed that DPAP and SPAP are closely related, with correlations greater than 0.90 indicating high confidence. Other authors have confirmed the relationship between DPAP and SPAP on large cohorts using allometric modeling relationship of peak and MPAP in PAH. 5,21 In the current study, we validated a novel interpolation novel interpolation method of the TR waveform. The method builds on the physiological relationships in the pulmonary circulation and integrates it with the TR waveform. It allows RVSP estimate not only based on a Pmax point but also upon a series of points of TR waveform physiologically relevant phases (isovolumic and ejection phases). As previously shown by Vanderpool et al., 8 analysis of the first and second derivatives of the RV pressure waveform can identify phases of the cardiac cycle. Here we applied first and second derivative analysis to the noninvasive TR waveform to identify early ejection phases. Theoretically, the RV pressure at the beginning of ejection will correspond to DPAP. Original to our study, we also used second derivative analysis to identify an ejection phase inflection point.",
                        "Our results demonstrated that interpolation of TR based on isovolumic or early ejection phases can provide reliable estimates of maximal RVSP. It also proved to be more reliable than multiple linear regression analysis based on the whole cohort. The observed limits of agreement can be explained physiologically. We observed overestimations when using isovolumic interpolation as it does not account for pulmonary valve opening and slight underestimation for ejection or shoulder methods as the insonation angle is rarely at a zero angle. The results in the outlier cohort demonstrated interpolation could improve clinical under or overestimation of RVSP.",
                        "In addition, we demonstrate that interpolation based on physiological points of the TR signal (classical model) can be useful. This builds on the observation of Chemla et al. 20  waveform where P eji corresponds to DPAP and P eje approximates MPAP. Although not as robust as thirddegree polynomial spline interpolation, our results provide a physiological basis for the cubic spline interpolation method."

                        "As shown in Figure 7, several technical and physiological based methods can improve reliability of pressure estimates or estimations of likelihood of pulmonary vascular disease. A reliable method starts with excellent acquisition of TR waveforms with minimal insonation angle, estimation of maximal TR velocity at the modal frequency, ensuring concordance with estimated mean pulmonary artery pressure using early peak pulmonary regurgitation velocity and potentially further informing estimates by VTIs or cubic polynomial interpolation methods. One cannot also emphasize the importance of reliable estimates of RAP. Septal curvature, RV shape, enlargement, pulmonary enlargement, and pulmonary flow profiles can further inform the probability of PH or pulmonary vascular disease.",

In the absence of these studies, this cannot be recommended, however."
