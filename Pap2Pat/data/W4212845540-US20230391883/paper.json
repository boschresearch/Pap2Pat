    "title": "An Fc-Competent Anti-Human TIGIT Blocking Antibody Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) Elicits Strong Immune Responses and Potent Anti-Tumor Efficacy in Pre-Clinical Models",

    "abstract": "TIGIT (T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain) has emerged as a promising target in cancer immunotherapy. It is an immune \u201ccheckpoint\u201d inhibitor primarily expressed on activated T cells, NK cells and Tregs. Engagement of TIGIT to its ligands PVR and PVR-L2 leads to inhibitory signaling in T cells, promoting functional exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes. Here, we described the pre-clinical characterization of Ociperlimab (BGB-A1217), a novel humanized IgG1 anti-TIGIT antibody (mAb), and systemically evaluated the contribution of Fc functions in the TIGIT mAb-mediated anti-tumor activities. BGB-A1217 binds to the extracellular domain of human TIGIT with high affinity (K D = 0.135 nM) and specificity, and efficiently blocks the interaction between TIGIT and its ligands PVR or PVR-L2. Cell-based assays show that BGB-A1217 significantly enhances T-cell functions. In addition, BGB-A1217 induces antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against Treg cells, activates NK cells and monocytes, and removes TIGIT from T cell surfaces in an Fc-dependent manner, In vivo , BGB-A1217, either alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb elicits strong immune responses and potent anti-tumor efficacy in pre-clinical models. Moreover, the Fc effector function is critical for the anti-tumor activity of BGB-A1217 in a syngeneic human TIGIT-knock-in mouse model. The observed anti-tumor efficacy is associated with a pharmacodynamic change of TIGIT down-regulation and Treg reduction. These data support the selection of BGB-A1217 with an effector function competent Fc region for clinical development for the treatment of human cancers.",

                "TIGIT (also known as VSIG9, VSTM3, WUCAM) is a member of the Ig superfamily receptors. It is expressed on activated CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, NK cells and Treg cells in both mouse and human. It binds to PVR/CD155 with high affinity and shows relatively weaker binding to PVRL2/CD112 (1\u20133). TIGIT can inhibit T-cell and NK-cell functions through multiple mechanisms, including delivering direct inhibitory signals (2, 4, 5), out-competing with DNAM-1/CD226 for PVR and PVRL2 binding (1, 2, 5), augmenting Treg immunosuppressive functions and stability (6, 7), and promoting tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) through the interaction with PVR on DCs (1).",
                "TIGIT expression is upregulated in the tumor microenvironment in multiple malignancies (8\u201312) and its expression on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has been associated with poor survival (13, 14). It is often co-expressed with PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors, such as TIM-3 and LAG-3, on exhausted CD8+ T cells and Tregs in tumors (9, 12, 15, 16). In addition, higher TIGIT expression was observed on tumor infiltrating Tregs than on other T-cell subtypes in TILs (15, 17) and some evidence has shown that TIGIT relies on Tregs to regulate the anti-tumor immune response in pre-clinical models (15). In patients, high TIGIT/DNAM-1 ratio on tumor-infiltrating Tregs has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in melanoma following anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapies (8). Taken together, all evidences indicate that targeting TIGIT, and further in combination with other immune checkpoint blockade therapies, may augment immune responses and achieve optimal anti-tumor efficacy.",
                "Currently, several anti-TIGIT mAbs have entered clinical stage. To be noted, different Fc formats are utilized. Tiragolumab from Genentech/Roche, vibostolimab from Merck, BGB-A1217 from BeiGene, and EOS-448 from iTeos (18) adopt wild type (wt) human IgG1, an Fc format with full effector functions, while COM902 from Compugen (19) and ASP8374 from Astellas/Potenza (20) utilize IgG4, an IgG type with weak effector functions; BMS-986207 from BMS and AB154 from Arcus were engineered with effector function-disabled Fc. In addition, SGN-TGT from Seattle Genetics harbors enhanced Fc functions via afucosylation. Those discrepancies raise an intriguing and critical question: is effector function-competent Fc format necessary for a TIGIT blockade antibody to achieve optimal anti-tumor efficacies?",
                "BGB-A1217, is a humanized TIGIT antibody currently under clinical development (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers: NCT04047862, etc.). In this report, we systemically characterized and studied the functional activities of BGB-A1217 both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the role of Fc functions in its anti-tumor effects, we generated a pair of anti-TIGIT antibodies with the same variable regions, but with different Fc forms: BGB-A1217 (with wild-type IgG1 Fc), and BGB-A1217MF (with an Fc lacking Fc\u03b3R binding capacities). Comparative characterizations of those two mAbs indicate that effector function-competent Fc is necessary for BGB-A1217 to elicit optimal anti-tumor efficacy in pre-clinical models, through mechanisms such as Treg reduction, NK cell and monocytes activation, as well as trogocytosis. In addition, BGB-A1217 and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment synergistically activate T cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in mouse models."

Fc\u03b3 receptor binding is an important functional attribute for immune checkpoint antibodies in cancer immunotherapy (23). To investigate whether the Fc effector function is critical for anti-TIGIT antibody\u2019s function, we generated two versions of anti-TIGIT antibodies: BGB-A1217, with wild-type IgG1 Fc; BGB-A1217MF, with mutant IgG1 Fc (ELLGG 233-237->PAAG-, P329A), abrogating its binding to Fc\u03b3Rs. Binding kinetics analysis by cell-based assay showed that both BGB-A1217 and BGB-A1217MF bind to TIGIT equally well ( Figure\u00a01A ).

One of the important Fc receptors is gamma Fc receptor IIIA (Fc\u03b3RIIIA), which mediates antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (23).

Using PBMC samples from lung cancer patients, we performed flow cytometric analysis of TIGIT expression among different T cell subtypes. As shown in  Figure\u00a03C , effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells express low to medium levels of TIGIT, whereas Treg cells express significantly higher level of TIGIT. In the ADCC assay, cancer patient derived PBMCs were used as target cells and NK cells from healthy donors were used as effector cells. After overnight co-culture of target PBMCs with NK effector cells, the percentages of non-Treg CD4+, CD8+ and Treg cell subsets in CD3+ T cells were quantified by flow cytometry. As shown in  Figure\u00a03D , Treg frequencies in CD3+ T cells were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner upon BGB-A1217 treatment, whereas the percentage remained largely unchanged in the BGB-A1217MF-treated group. In contrast, neither BGB-A1217 nor BGB-A1217MF treatment altered the frequencies of effector CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells ( Figures\u00a03E, F  and  Supplementary Figure\u00a03 ). The results clearly indicate that the BGB-A1217 is able to induce ADCC against Treg cells in cancer patient derived PBMCs.

Compared to BGB-A1217MF, BGB-A1217 dramatically removed TIGIT from the surface of Jurkat/TIGIT/DNAM-1 cells, in the presence of HEK293/Fc\u03b3Rs. Among all the receptors, Fc\u03b3RI showed the highest potential to mediate trogocytosis, consistent with its highest affinity to human IgG1, followed by Fc\u03b3RIIA, Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA-V158, the Fc\u03b3RIIIA isoform with higher affinity to human IgG1. Fc\u03b3RIIIA-F158, the Fc\u03b3RIIIA isoform with lower affinity to human IgG1, exhibited lower potency to mediated trogocytosis ( Figure\u00a05B ). Considering that in humans, binding of BGB-A1217 to Fc\u03b3Rs, particularly to Fc\u03b3R1 can be blocked by endogenous IgG, we evaluated the impact of serum in the trogocytosis assay. When human AB serum added to achieve 20% human serum in the culture system, the trogocytosis via Fc\u03b3RI was significantly inhibited. However, other Fc\u03b3Rs were less affected ( Supplementary Figure\u00a05 ). It is possible that the trogocytosis through Fc\u03b3R1 in human can be largely blocked by endogenous IgG, however, immune complex formation upon BGB-A1217 binding to TIGIT will significantly increase its affinity to low affinity receptors (Fc\u03b3RIIA, IIB, IIIA), leading to relevant Fc-mediated effector functions, including trogocytosis.",

As shown in  Figures\u00a05C\u2013H , BGB-A1217, rather than BGB-A1217MF, induced the Fc-dependent trogocytosis, either when monocytes ( Figure\u00a05D ) or DCs ( Figure\u00a05G ) were used as Fc\u03b3R+ acceptor cells. Blockade of Fc\u03b3RI on monocytes ( Figure\u00a05E ) significantly inhibited the trogocytosis. Similar effects were observed when either Fc\u03b3RI or Fc\u03b3RIIA on DCs was blocked ( Figure\u00a05H ). The differential capability of BGB-A1217 and BGB-A1217MF to induce trogocytosis is highly unlikely from variation in mAb labeling since we have confirmed that the labeling efficiency of BGB-A1217 and BGB-A1217MF are comparable ( Supplementary Figure\u00a06 )."

Although the extent of contribution of ADCC/ADCP to the clinical outcomes of ipilimumab (an IgG1-form mAb targeting CTLA-4) has not been fully understood, it has been documented that human Fc\u03b3R polymorphisms impact responses to ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma (30).",
                "Here, through in vitro and in vivo studies, we have demonstrated anti-TIGIT mAb BGB-A1217 functions, at least in part, through depletion of intra-tumoral Tregs. It has been well-known that target density plays a critical role in regulating ADCC (31, 32). Preferential depletion of tumor infiltrating Tregs depends on both a higher density of the target molecules on Tregs relative to other T cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and the presence of ADCC/ADCP mediating cells. The highest expression of TIGIT on tumor infiltrating Tregs relative to other T cell subsets and the presence of NK and macrophages in the TME likely explains the preferential depletion of Tregs in tumors by BGB-A1217. TIGIT+ Tregs represent a functionally distinct Treg subsets which are highly immunosuppressive (6). Higher expression of TIGIT on intra-tumoral Tregs renders them the most susceptible target for ADCC/ADCP, whereas sparing effector T cells from cell killing, thus making it desirable to take full advantage of the Fc function of TIGIT mAbs. However, the polymorphisms of Fc\u03b3Rs added the complexity of the dependence of ADCC/ADCP of anti-TIGIT mAb activities in humans, suggesting a need for appropriate stratification of patients based on polymorphism status.",
                "As an important part of innate immunity, NK cells play critical role in immunosurveillance against tumor cells. In this report, we clearly showed that both Fc-silent and -competent BGB-A1217 could elicit NK cell activation in the presence of PVR+ tumor cells. However, the extent of NK activation by BGB-A1217MF (Fc-silent) is significantly lower than that by Fc-competent BGB-A1217, suggesting that besides TIGIT ligand blockade functions, the capability of Fc\u03b3R co-engagement is also required for optimal NK activation by TIGIT mAbs. The dominant Fc\u03b3Rs expressed on NK cells are Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16a). Two isoforms exist and both are stimulatory: Fc\u03b3RIIIA-V158 with higher affinity to IgG1, while Fc\u03b3RIIIA-F158 with lower affinity (23). Additive and/or synergistic effects after co-engagement of TIGIT and Fc\u03b3RIIIA in NK cells with tumor cells suggest that several NK activatory pathways (such as DANM-1 and Fc\u03b3RIIIA) may converge downstream, leading to stronger signals. In this case, it is also important to assure that Fc\u03b3R crosslinking do not trigger NK fratricide (which means NK cell self-killing in the absence of target cells). Notably, in the absence of tumor cells, BGB-A1217 was not able to elicit significant NK activation or induce obvious NK fratricide ( Supplementary Figure\u00a07 ), suggesting good safety profile of BGB-A1217.",
                "Besides the activation effects on lymphoid arm, we also observed the Fc-dependent stimulatory role of BGB-A1217 on myeloid cells, which is consistent with the findings by Han et\u00a0al. (33). Considering that TIGIT expression is higher in TME than in periphery, and abundant myeloid cells that express Fc\u03b3Rs infiltrate into tumors to create a highly suppressive microenvironment, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the high density of TIGIT and Fc\u03b3R expression in TME creates an ideal scenario for Fc\u03b3R-mediated myeloid cell activation, relieving its immune-suppressive activity and leading to better immune stimulation. It is well established that engagement of ITAM-bearing type I Fc\u03b3Rs by IgG complexes leads to cellular activation and subsequent induction of effector functions, which include phagocytosis, dendritic cell maturation, antigen presentation, and macrophage polarization (34). Further studies are needed to delineate to what extent BGB-A1217 modulate myeloid cells and which Fc\u03b3Rs are involved in the modulation.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to show that anti-TIGIT mAb can induce trogocytosis of TIGIT though binding to Fc\u03b3R+ cells. It has been well documented that binding of anti-CD38 mAb Daratumumab, anti-CD20 mAb rituximab, anti-HER2 mAb trastuzumab, anti-EGFR mAb cetuximab etc. to cancer cells promotes trogocytosis mediated by monocytes and other Fc\u03b3R+ cells (25, 35, 36). However, no reports documented whether anti-TIGIT mAbs can induce Fc\u03b3R-mediated trogocytosis. We clearly demonstrated the removal of TIGIT from human T cell surface by monocytes and DCs in the presence of BGB-A1217, but not BGB-A1217MF (Fc-silent). The high affinity Fc\u03b3RI played a critical role on monocytes while both Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIA are essential on DCs to mediate the trogocytosis. The finding is in line with our cell line-based studies and is consistent with the expression pattens of Fc\u03b3Rs on monocytes and DCs (37). Johnston et al. showed that TIGIT impaired CD226 function by directly disrupting homodimerization of the stimulatory molecule DNAM-1 (9). The removal of TIGIT from T cell and NK cell surface may not only \u201cremove\u201d the downstream inhibitory signaling of TIGIT, but may also prevent the disruption of DNAM-1 homodimerization by TIGIT, thus rejuvenating the effector cells. It is possible that trogocytosis induced removal of TIGIT from Tregs may compromise the ADCC/ADCP effects due to reduced molecular density. However, on the other hand, it may help spare effector T cells from ADCC/ADCP while retaining the Treg depletion through delicate modulations of the surface expression of TIGIT.",
                "In vivo efficacy-wise, our results from mouse models have clearly demonstrated the anti-tumor efficacy of BGB-A1217 either as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb. In addition, competent Fc function is indispensable for eliciting its anti-tumor activity and there is correlation between efficacy and pharmacodynamic changes (such as Treg depletion). Intriguingly, there was a dramatic up-regulation of TIGIT, and down-regulation of DNAM-1 on T cells and NK cells after treatment by BGB-A1217, which may be due to the depletion of TIGIThighDNAM-1low cells by BGB-A1217, or possibly due to TIGIT removal via trogocytosis.",
                "In summary, our study demonstrated the immune activation and anti-tumor activity of an anti-TIGIT mAb BGB-A1217 in pre-clinical models. The distinct MOAs between anti-TIGIT antibodies ( Figures\u00a08A\u2013E ) and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies highlighted the potential of BGB-A1217 to be used in combination therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking mAbs in cancer treatment and provided strong rationale for using wild-type IgG1 Fc as the optimal format. We have proposed and validated multiple MOAs for the desirable Fc engagement, including Treg depletion via ADCC/ADCP, NK and myeloid cell activation, and trogocytosis in pre-clinical models. Further clinical studies are needed to shed light on those mechanisms and provide answers to whether those mechanisms can be translated from bench to clinical development."
