                        "TIGIT (T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain) is a type I transmembrane protein, a member of the CD28 family of proteins that plays an important role in inhibiting T- and NK cell-mediated functional activities in anti-tumor immunity (Boles K S, et al., 2009 Eur J Immunol, 39:695-703; Stanietsky N, et al., 2009 PNAS 106:17858-63; Yu X, et al. 2009 Nat. Immunol, 10:48-57).",
                        "The genes and cDNAs coding for TIGIT were cloned and characterized in mouse and human. Full length human TIGIT has a sequence of 244 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 1) in length, in which the first 21 amino acids consist a signal peptide. The amino acid sequence of the mature human TIGIT contains 223 amino acid (aa) residues (NCBI accession number: NM_173799). The extracellular domain (ECD) of mature human TIGIT consists of 120 amino acid residues (SEQ ID NO: 2, corresponding to amino acids 22-141 of SEQ ID NO: 1) with a V-type Ig-like domain (corresponding to amino acids 39-127 of SEQ ID NO: 1), followed by a 21 aa transmembrane sequence, and an 82 aa cytoplasmic domain with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (Yu X, et al. 2009 Nat. Immunol, 10:48-57; Stengel K F, et al. 2012 PNAS 109:5399-04). Within the ECD, human TIGIT shares only 59% and 87% aa sequence identity with mouse and cynomolgus monkey, respectively.",
                        "TIGIT is expressed on T cells (including activated T cells, memory T cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells, and follicular T helper (Tfh) cells), and NK cells (Boles K S, et al., 2009 Eur J Immunol, 39:695-703; Joller N, et al., 2014 Immunity 40:569-81; Levin S D, et al., 2011 Eur J Immunol, 41:902-15; Stanietsky N, et al., 2009 PNAS 106:17858-63; Yu X, et al. 2009 Nat. Immunol, 10:48-57).",
                        "So far, two TIGIT ligands, CD155 (also known as poliovirus receptor or PVR) and CD112 (also known as poliovirus receptor-related 2, PVRL2, nectin-2), have been identified. These ligands are primarily expressed on APCs (such as dendritic cells and macrophages) and tumor cells (Casado J G, et al., 2009 Cancer Immunol Immunother 58:1517-26; Levin S D, et al., 2011 Eur J Immunol, 41:902-15; Mendelsohn C L et al., 1989 56:855-65; Stanietsky N, et al., 2009 PNAS 106:17858-63; Yu X, et al. 2009 Nat. Immunol, 10:48-57). As an immune \u201ccheckpoint\u201d molecule, TIGIT initiates inhibitory signaling in immune cells when engaged by its ligands, CD155 and CD112. The binding affinity of TIGIT to CD155 (Kd: \u02dc1 nM) is much higher than to CD112 and whether the TIGIT: CD112 interaction is functionally relevant in mediating inhibitory signals yet remain to be determined. A co-stimulatory receptor, CD226 (DNAM-1), binds to the same ligands with lower affinity (Kd: \u02dc100 nM), but delivers a positive signal (Bottino C, et al., 2003 J Exp Med 198:557-67). In addition, CD96 (Tactile), a \u201cTIGIT-like\u201d receptor, also plays a similarly inhibitory role in the same pathway (Chan C J, et al., 2014 Nat. Immunol 15:431-8).",
                        "TIGIT can inhibit immune responses through different mechanisms. First, interaction between TIGIT and PVR on dendritic cells (DCs) could deliver a \u201creverse signaling\u201d in DCs, leading to up-regulation of IL-10 and decrease of IL-12 secretion, thereby inhibiting T-cell activation (Yu X, et al. Nat Immunol. 2009 10:48-57). Second, TIGIT binds to CD155 with higher affinity, thereby competing off DNAM-1-CD155 interaction. Third, direct ligation of TIGIT on T cells could down-regulate TCR-mediated activation and subsequent proliferation and engagement of TIGIT on NK cells block NK cell cytotoxicity (Joller N, et al. 2011 186: 1338-42; Stanietsky N, et al., 2009 PNAS 106:17858-63). Fourth, TIGIT expression on Tregs has been associated with a highly activated and suppressive phenotype in tumor tissue and TIGIT signaling in Tregs may favor Treg stability (Joller N, et al. Immunity 2014 40:569-81; Kurtulus S, et al. J Clin Invest. 2015 125: 4053-4062).",
                        "TIGIT has an immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT)-like motif followed by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic tail (Yu X, et al. Nat Immunol. 2009 10:48-57; Engels N, et al. Curr Opin Immunol 2011 23: 324-329). These motifs could mediate recruitment of the phosphatase SHIP-1 and \u03b2-arrestin 2 (Li M, et al. J Biol Chem. 2014 289:17647-17657; Liu S, et al. Cell death and differentiation 2013 20: 456-464), thus providing a mechanism by which TIGIT can intrinsically deliver inhibitory signals to dampen activating signals.",
                        "Up-regulation of TIGIT expression in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been reported in many types of cancers such as lung (Tassi, et al., Cancer Res. 2017 77: 851-861), esophageal (Xie J, et al., Oncotarget 2016 7:63669-63678), breast (Gil Del Alcazar C R, et al. 2017 Cancer Discov.), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kong Y et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2016 22:3057-66) and melanoma (Chauvin J M, et al., J Clin Invest. 2015 125:2046-2058). The increased expression of TIGIT in AML is associated with poor prognosis of patient survival outcome (Kong Y et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2016 22:3057-66). Not only does up-regulation of TIGIT signaling play important roles in immune tolerance to cancer, but also to chronic viral infection. During HIV infection, expression of TIGIT on T cells was significantly higher and positively correlated with viral loads and disease progression (Chew G M, et al., 2016 PLoS Pathog. 12:e1005349). In addition, blockade of TIGIT receptor alone or in combination with other blockade could rescue functionally \u201cexhausted\u201d T cells both in vitro and in vivo (Chauvin J M, et al., J Clin Invest. 2015 125:2046-2058; Chew G M, et al., 2016 PLoS Pathog. 12:e1005349; Johnston R J, et al. Cancer Cell 2014 26:923-937). In the cases of cancer and viral infections, activation of TIGIT signaling promotes immune cell dysfunction, leading to the cancer outgrowth or extended viral infection. Inhibition of TIGIT-mediated inhibitory signaling by therapeutic agents may restore the functional activities of immune cells including T cells, NK cells and dendritic cells (DCs), therefore enhancing immunity against cancer or chronic viral infection.",
                        "Monoclonal antibodies that target either PD1 or PDL1, can block this interaction and boost the immune response against cancer cells. These antibodies have been shown to be helpful in treating several types of cancer, including melanoma of the skin, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Cancer cells in most non-responders to single-agent checkpoint inhibitors escape through innate mechanisms that allow the cancer cells to grow and survive. As a result, disease progresses at a rate consistent with the natural history. However, unlike intrinsic resistance, late relapses are now emerging in patients with prior clinical benefit after longer follow-up of clinical trials, suggesting the emergence of acquired resistance (Jenkins et al., Br. J. Cancer 118, 9-16 2018).",
                        "Therefore, the combination of anti-TIGIT antibodies in combination with anti-PD1 antibodies can rescue immune cells from tolerance, inducing efficient immune responses in the treatment of cancer or chronic viral infections."

An antibody is usually monospecific, but may also be described as idiospecific, heterospecific, or polyspecific. Antibody molecules bind by means of specific binding sites to specific antigenic determinants or epitopes on antigens.",
                                "The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d or \u201cmAb\u201d or \u201cMab\u201d herein means a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the antibody molecules comprised in the population are identical in amino acid sequence except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of different antibodies having different amino acid sequences in their variable domains, particularly their complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which are often specific for different epitopes. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. See, for example Kohler G et al., Nature 1975 256:495-497; U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110; Ausubel F M et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY 1992; Harlow E et al., ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold spring Harbor Laboratory 1988; and Colligan J E et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN IMMUNOLOGY 1993. The mAbs disclosed herein may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA, and any subclass thereof. A hybridoma producing a mAb may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo. High titers of mAbs can be obtained by in vivo production where cells from the individual hybridomas are injected intraperitoneally into mice, such as pristine-primed Balb/c mice to produce ascites fluid containing high concentrations of the desired mAbs. MAbs of isotype IgM or IgG may be purified from such ascites fluids, or from culture supernatants, using column chromatography methods well known to those of skill in the art.",
                                "In general, the basic antibody structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer includes two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight chain\u201d (about 25 kDa) and one \u201cheavy chain\u201d (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain may define a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Typically, human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Furthermore, human heavy chains are typically classified as \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, or \u03bc, and define the antibody's isotypes as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, respectively. Within light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined by a \u201cJ\u201d region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a \u201cD\u201d region of about 10 more amino acids.",
                                "The variable regions of each light/heavy chain (VL/VH) pair form the antibody binding site. Thus, in general, an intact antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies, the two binding sites are, in general, the same.",
                                "Typically, the variable domains of both the heavy and light chains comprise three hypervariable regions, also called \u201ccomplementarity determining regions (CDRs)\u201d, which are located between relatively conserved framework regions (FR). The CDRs are usually aligned by the framework regions, enabling binding to a specific epitope. In general, from N-terminal to C-terminal, both light and heavy chain variable domains sequentially comprise FR-1 (or FR1), CDR-1 (or CDR1), FR-2 (FR2), CDR-2 (CDR2), FR-3 (or FR3), CDR-3 (CDR3), and FR-4 (or FR4). The assignment of amino acids to each domain is, generally, in accordance with the definitions of Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Kabat, et al., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; 5th ed.; NIH Publ. No. 91-3242 (1991); Kabat (1978) Adv. Prot. Chem. 32: 1-75; Kabat, et al., (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252:6609-6616; Chothia, et al, (1987) J Mol.

                                "The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d means the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a \u201cCDR\u201d (i.e., VL-CDR1, VL-CDR2 and VL-CDR3 in the light chain variable domain and VH-CDR1, VH-CDR2 and VH-CDR3 in the heavy chain variable domain). See, Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (defining the CDR regions of an antibody by sequence); see also Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917 (defining the CDR regions of an antibody by structure). The term \u201cframework\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues mean those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues.",

Examples of antigen binding fragments include, but not limited to, Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., single chain Fv (ScFv); nanobodies and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.",
                                "An antibody that binds to a specified target protein with specificity is also described as specifically binding to a specified target protein. This means the antibody exhibits preferential binding to that target as compared to other proteins, but this specificity does not require absolute binding specificity. An antibody is considered \u201cspecific\u201d for its intended target if its binding is determinative of the presence of the target protein in a sample, e.g., without producing undesired results such as false positives. Antibodies or binding fragments thereof, useful in the present invention will bind to the target protein with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least 10-times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with non-target proteins. An antibody herein is said to bind specifically to a polypeptide comprising a given amino acid sequence, e.g., the amino acid sequence of a mature human TIGIT molecule, if it binds to polypeptides comprising that sequence but does not bind to proteins lacking that sequence.",
                                "The expressions \u201cpH-dependent binding\u201d, \u201cpH-dependent target binding\u201d and \u201cpH-dependent antigen binding\u201d are interchangeable in the present disclosure, indicating that the antibody of the present application binds to its target/antigen, namely human TIGIT, in a pH-dependent manner. Specifically, the antibody of the present application shows a higher binding affinity and/or binding signal to its antigen at a mild acidic pH, e.g. pH 6.0, which is usually found in tumor microenvironment, as compared to the binding affinity and/or binding signal at physiologic pH, e.g. pH 7.4. The methods for determining the binding affinity and/or the intensity of binding signal of the antibody of the present application are well known in the art and include but not limited to surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) or similar technology. More specifically, the antibody of the present application has a KD ratio at pH 7.4/pH 6.0 of greater than 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or more, as measured by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) or similar technology. Alternatively, or additionally, the antibody of the present application has a Rmax (RU) value at pH 6.0 which is at least 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50- fold higher than the Rmax at pH 7.4 as measured by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) or similar technology. The binding affinity of the antibody can be measured at 25\u00b0 C. or 37\u00b0 C. Tumor microenvironment has been found to show a relatively more acidic pH than physiological condition or normal tissues (Zhang et al. Focus on molecular Imaging 2010; Tannock and Rotin et al. Cancer Res 1989). Therefore, the antibody of the present application having above-mentioned pH-dependent binding is advantageous as an anti-TIGIT therapeutic agent for targeting TIGIT-positive lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment with selectivity and having lower toxicity associated with periphery activation of lymphocytes.",
                                "The term \u201chuman antibody\u201d herein means an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, \u201cmouse antibody\u201d or \u201crat antibody\u201d means an antibody that comprises only mouse or rat immunoglobulin protein sequences, respectively.",
                                "The term \u201chumanized antibody\u201d means forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. Such antibodies contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The prefix \u201chum\u201d, \u201chu\u201d, \u201cHu\u201d or \u201ch\u201d is added to antibody clone designations when necessary to distinguish humanized antibodies from parental rodent antibodies. The humanized forms of rodent antibodies will generally comprise the same CDR sequences of the parental rodent antibodies, although certain amino acid substitutions may be included to increase affinity, increase stability of the humanized antibody, or for other reasons.",
                                "The antibody of the present application has potential therapeutic uses in treating cancer. The term \u201ccancer\u201d or \u201ctumor\u201d herein means or describes the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to, lung cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer), adrenal cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, cervical cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, bladder cancer, bone cancer, brain cancer, an endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, skin cancer, thyroid tumor, or metastatic lesion of the cancer.",
                                "Further, the antibody of the present application has potential therapeutic uses in controlling viral infections and other human diseases that are mechanistically involved in immune tolerance or \u201cexhaustion.\u201d In the context of the present application, the term \u201cexhaustion\u201d refers to a process which leads to a depleted ability of immune cells to respond during to a cancer or a chronic viral infection.",
                                "The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d as herein used, refers to the amount of an antibody that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease or a disorder, or at least one of the clinical symptoms of a disease or disorder, is sufficient to affect such treatment for the disease, disorder, or symptom. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d can vary with the antibody, the disease, disorder, and/or symptoms of the disease or disorder, severity of the disease, disorder, and/or symptoms of the disease or disorder, the age of the subject to be treated, and/or the weight of the subject to be treated. An appropriate amount in any given instance can be apparent to those skilled in the art or can be determined by routine experiments. In the case of combination therapy, the \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to the total amount of the active agents comprised in the combination for the effective treatment of a disease, a disorder or a condition.",

For example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al.",

In a specific aspect, one or more amino acids of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present disclosure are replaced by one or more allotypic amino acid residues, for the IgG1 subclass and the kappa isotype. Allotypic amino acid residues also include, but are not limited to, the constant region of the heavy chain of the IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 subclasses as well as the constant region of the light chain of the kappa isotype as described by Jefferis et al., MAbs. 1:332-338 (2009).",

This approach is described in, e.g., the PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1 for Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, Fc\u03b3RIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604, 2001).",
                                "In still another aspect, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycosylated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks or has reduced glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for \u201cantigen.\u201d Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation can increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al.",
                                "Additionally, or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn (297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al., describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180, 1999).",
                                "In another aspect, if a reduction of ADCC is desired, human antibody subclass IgG4 was shown in many previous reports to have only modest ADCC and almost no CDC effector function (Moore G L, et al. 2010 MAbs, 2:181-189). On the other hand, natural IgG4 was found less stable in stress conditions such as in acidic buffer or under increasing temperature (Angal, S. 1993 Mol Immunol, 30:105-108; Dall'Acqua, W. et al, 1998 Biochemistry, 37:9266-9273; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). Reduced ADCC can be achieved by operably linking the antibody to IgG4 engineered with combinations of alterations to have reduced or null Fc\u03b3R binding or C1q binding activities, thereby reducing or eliminating ADCC and CDC effector functions. Considering physicochemical properties of antibody as a biological drug, one of the less desirable, intrinsic properties of IgG4 is dynamic separation of its two heavy chains in solution to form half antibody, which lead to bi-specific antibodies generated in vivo via a process called \u201cFab arm exchange\u201d (Van der Neut Kolfschoten M, et al. 2007 Science, 317:1554-157). The mutation of serine to proline at position 228 (EU numbering system) appeared inhibitory to the IgG4 heavy chain separation (Angal, S. 1993 Mol Immunol, 30:105-108; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). Some of the amino acid residues in the hinge and \u03b3Fc region were reported to have impact on antibody interaction with Fc\u03b3 receptors (Chappel S M, et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:9036-9040; Mukherjee, J. et al., 1995 FASEB J, 9:115-119; Armour, K. L. et al. 1999 Eur J Immunol, 29:2613-2624; Clynes, R. A. et al, 2000 Nature Medicine, 6:443-446; Arnold J. N., 2007 Annu Rev immunol, 25:21-50). Furthermore, some rarely occurring IgG4 isoforms in human population can also elicit different physicochemical properties (Brusco, A. et al. 1998 Eur J Immunogenet, 25:349-55; Aalberse et al. 2002 Immunol, 105:9-19). To generate TIGIT antibodies with low ADCC, CDC and instability, it is possible to modify the hinge and Fc region of human IgG4 and introduce a number of alterations. These modified IgG4 Fc molecules can be found disclosed in SEQ ID NOs: 83-88, U.S. Pat. No. 8,735,553."

Typically, the expression vectors contain a promoter and other regulatory sequences (e.g., enhancers) that are operably linked to the polynucleotides encoding an anti-TIGIT antibody chain or antigen-binding fragment. In some aspects, an inducible promoter is employed to prevent expression of inserted sequences except under the control of inducing conditions. Inducible promoters include, e.g., arabinose, lacZ, metallothionein promoter or a heat shock promoter. Cultures of transformed organisms can be expanded under non-inducing conditions without biasing the population for coding sequences whose expression products are better tolerated by the host cells. In addition to promoters, other regulatory elements can also be required or desired for efficient expression of an anti-TIGIT antibody or antigen-binding fragment. These elements typically include an ATG initiation codon and adjacent ribosome binding site or other sequences. In addition, the efficiency of expression can be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use (see, e.g., Scharf et al., Results Probl. Cell Differ. 20:125, 1994; and Bittner et al., Meth. Enzymol., 153:516, 1987). For example, the SV40 enhancer or CMV enhancer can be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells.",

In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression vectors, which typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell (e.g., an origin of replication). In addition, any number of a variety of well-known promoters will be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a beta-lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like, for initiating and completing transcription and translation. Other microbes, such as yeast, can also be employed to express anti-TIGIT polypeptides. Insect cells in combination with baculovirus vectors can also be used.",

Expression vectors for mammalian host cells can include expression control sequences, such as an origin of replication, a promoter, and an enhancer (see, e.g., Queen et al., Immunol. Rev. 89:49-68, 1986), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. These expression vectors usually contain promoters derived from mammalian genes or from mammalian viruses. Suitable promoters can be constitutive, cell type-specific, stage-specific, and/or modulatable or regulatable. Useful promoters include, but are not limited to, the metallothionein promoter, the constitutive adenovirus major late promoter, the dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter, the SV40 promoter, the MRP polIII promoter, the constitutive MPSV promoter, the tetracycline-inducible CMV promoter (such as the human immediate-early CMV promoter), the constitutive CMV promoter, and promoter-enhancer combinations known in the art."

                                "Trogocytosis is a phenomenon, in which cell surface molecules are transferred from donor cells to acceptor cells (Joly E, et al. 2003 Nat. Immunol; Machlenkin A, et al. 2008 Cancer Res.; Beum P V et al. 2008 J. Immunol; Rossi E A, et al. 2013 Blood). Antibody-induced trogocytosis via Fc \u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) leads to down-modulation of receptors on the cell surface (Carlsten et al. 2016 Clin Cancer Res; Beum et al. 2011 J. Immunology). Therefore, down-regulation of target receptor by trogocytosis may cause dampened signaling. In view of these observations, it would be possible that hu1217-2-2/IgG1 might induce trogocytosis of TIGIT receptor in the presence of Fc\u03b3R+ cells, resulting in lower surface expression. To address this possibility, Jurkat/TIGIT cells were incubated with HEK cells expressing various Fc\u03b3Rs (including Fc\u03b3RIIAH131, Fc\u03b3RIIB, Fc\u03b3RIIIAV158) with biotin-labeled hu1217-2-2/IgG1wt (a humanized antibody comprising the same VL and VH sequences as hu1217-2-2/IgG1mf and a wild-type IgG1 Fc region) or hu1217-2-2/IgG1mf overnight. Surface expression of TIGIT receptor was determined by with SA-APC (Biolegend). As shown in FIG. 8, hu1217-2-2/IgG1 but not hu1217-2-2/IgG1mf caused a significant reduction of TIGIT surface expression compared to the negative control human IgG-treated cells, indicating that the reduction of surface TIGIT on Jurkat/TIGIT cells are Fc\u03b3R-binding dependent. In addition, presence of 10% human serum (containing high-level of endogenous IgG) could partially reduce Fc\u03b3RIIAH131\u2212 or Fc\u03b3RIIIAV158, but not Fc\u03b3RIIB-mediated trogocytosis of TIGIT receptor, suggesting that Fc\u03b3RIIB could play a critical role reducing TIGIT surface expression by anti-TIGIT mAbs (e.g., hu1217-2-2/IgG1wt) in vivo. These observations are also consistent with previous findings (Ganesan L P, et al. 2012 J Immunol 189:4981-8; Taylor R P, et al. 2015 Blood 125:762-6).",

The cell death due to CDC was assayed by the decrease of ATP released from viable cells after cell lysis at the end of reaction. Anti-MHC-I A, B, C was used as a positive control. The fluorescence readout was conducted using a 96-well fluorometer (PHERA Star FS, BMG LABTECH), and the CDC activities were calculated from the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) readout as follows: % CDC activity=[(RFU test\u2212RFU background)/(RFU at total cell lysis\u2212RFU background)]\u00d7100.

The disease is more common in men than women, representing 16.8% of all cancers in men and 8.8% of all cancers in women. In China, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women, with an estimated 610,200 deaths and an estimated 733,300 new cases in the year 2015 (Chen et al., CA Cancer J Clin. 2016; 66(2):115-32). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) originates from the epithelial cells of the lung and accounts for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers. There are 3 main histological subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma which constitutes 40% of all NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma which accounts for 25% and large cell carcinoma which constitutes 10% of all NSCLC.",

Lung cancer staging is performed worldwide according to the tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) Classification of Malignant Tumors, Seventh Edition (Goldstraw et al., J Thorac Oncol 2007; 2(8):706-14). If lung cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages, cure is possible through surgery or chemo-radiation therapy. Unfortunately, lung cancer cases are most often detected at a relatively late stage. Approximately one third of patients with NSCLC present with locally advanced Stage III disease, including involvement of locoregional mediastinal lymph nodes or organs. The five-year survival rates for patients with Stage III disease range from 36% (Stage IIIA) to 13% (Stage IIIC). Fifty-five percent of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC have distal metastases (Stage IV). Stage IVA patients present with contralateral lung involvement, malignant pleural effusion, and malignant pericardial effusion or with metastases in a single location outside the chest, for instance, a distal lymph node or organ such as brain, liver, or bone. Stage IVB patients present with disease that has spread to multiple locations either distal lymph nodes or organs. The 5-year survival rate for patients with Stage IV NSCLC is 5% (Siegel et al., A Cancer Journal for Clinicians 2020; 70(1):7-30). Patients with squamous NSCLC may receive platinum-based doublets with either gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or taxanes. Patients with nonsquamous NSCLC are administered pemetrexed based combination chemotherapy with carboplatin or cisplatin. Single agent pembrolizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as first line therapy for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express a high level of PD-L1 (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS]\u226550%) based on results from the KEYNOTE 024 trial (Reck et al., N Engl J Med. 2016; 375(19):1823-33).

Pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based therapy has also been granted accelerated approval by the FDA as a first-line treatment for patients with Stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC and no EGFR or ALK genomic aberrations based on the results from KEYNOTE 021 (Langer et al., Lancet Oncol. 2016; 17(11):1497-1508).",

NPC remains a leading cause of death from cancer with a global incidence of mortality of approximately 72,987 cases per year (Bray et al., supra). Depending on the degree of differentiation NPC is categorized into three pathological subtypes on the basis of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Differentiated tumors with surface keratin are defined as type I, whereas types II and III refer to nonkeratinizing differentiated and undifferentiated tumors, respectively. In 1991, types II and III were combined into a single category of non-keratinizing carcinoma. In regions where NPC is endemic, nonkeratinizing subtypes constitute most cases (>95%) and are invariably associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, whereas type I disease is more common in other parts of the world (Wei et al., Lancet 2005; 365: 2041-54; Nicholls et al., Adv Anat Path 1997; 4: 71-84). EBV infection is the most extensively studied etiological factor for NPC. On the basis of in situ hybridization techniques for EBV-encoded RNAs, the virus is detected exclusively in all tumor cells but not in normal nasopharyngeal epithelium, suggesting that EBV activation is necessary in the pathogenesis of NPC (Pathmanathan et al., N Engl J Med. 1995; 333: Chan et al., Cancer Res 2000; 60: 5365-70).

Preliminary data of BGB-A317 as monotherapy in an expansion cohort of patients with NPC in a previous clinical trial is also encouraging (median ORR: 43%; median OS, not reached; median PFS, 12.4 months).
