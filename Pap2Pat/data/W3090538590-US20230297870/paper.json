    "abstract": "We propose a scheme for universal quantum computing based on Kramers rare-earth ions. Their nuclear spins in the presence of a Zeeman-split electronic crystal field ground state act as 'passive' qubits which store quantum information. The qubits can be activated optically by fast coherent transitions to excited crystal field states with a magnetic moment. The dipole interaction between these states is used to implement CNOT gates. We compare our proposal with a similar one based on phosphorus donor atoms in silicon and discuss the significantly improved CNOT gate time as compared to rare-earth implementations via the slower dipole blockade.",

                "Rare-earth (RE) ions embedded in an insulating solidstate matrix provide an interesting platform for quantum information processing. The nuclear spins and the electronic crystal field (CF) levels of RE ions can be used to store and manipulate quantum states. Because of the long coherence times of the quantum states of RE ions, they are well suited for the implementation of qubits. Dephasing times ranging from 100 \u03bcs for electronic transitions between CF states [1] to 1.3 s for nuclear transitions [2], and even up to six hours by employing dynamical decoupling [3] have recently been demonstrated.",
                "Furthermore, the possibility to read out single spin states has been demonstrated using detection of photons emitted from yttrium aluminum garnet [4,5], yttrium orthovanadate [6], and yttrium orthosilicate [7][8][9]. Some RE ions exhibit CF transitions in the frequency range used in telecommunications, which makes them well suited as quantum repeaters [10,11].",
                "Previous schemes for quantum computing with RE ions proposed to use electric dipolar interactions of CF states, suggesting to realize a controlled NOT (CNOT) gate via an indirect dipole blockade [12][13][14]. In that scheme, the dipole field from the control qubit shifts the transition frequencies of the target qubit. This is exploited to implement a CNOT gate with a sequence of pulses, which is effective only if the control bit is in the logical 1 state.",
                "Here instead we propose a faster two-qubit gate based on the magnetic dipole interaction, which is inspired by Ref. [15] and has some similarity to hybrid electron and nuclear spin schemes for nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond [16]. In Fig. 1 we show the basic principle, and the underpinning hierarchy of relevant energy scales is presented in Fig. 2. By making use of the nontrivial unitary evolution of the active qubits under this Hamiltonian (i.e., a state-dependent phase accumulation), the full interaction strength can be exploited to execute the gate. For qubits spaced by more than of the order of 1 nm, the gate time is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude as compared with the dipole-blockade scheme. In contrast to the dipole-blockade gate, this faster gate that couples qubits at longer ranges requires a precise knowledge of the dipolar interaction strength.",
                "Our quantum computing scheme shares several features with that proposed by Hill et al. [15] for phosphorus donors in silicon. As in that proposal, we use nuclear spins as passive qubits, dipole-coupled active qubits, and essentially the same CNOT implementation. However, our scheme has substantial advantages in speed (a factor of 600 faster for single-qubit gates), interaction strength, and simplicity. There are also schemes that use electric dipolar interactions, e.g., between phosphorus donors in silicon; The passive (memory) qubit consists of nuclear degrees of freedom in the presence of polarized electronic RE spins. Even though the electronic spins create substantial internal fields, they are much smaller than the external field, such that the electronic system remains in its gapped, fully polarized ground state and spin flips are suppressed. The nuclear qubits can be selectively activated by optical excitation to a (locally tunable) electronic CF doublet with a large magnetic moment. Two activated qubits communicate via the electronic (magnetic) dipolar interaction, allowing for fast two-qubit gates over distances of several 10 nm, as long as the dipolar interaction is sufficiently strong as compared with the inverse lifetime of the active qubits. This enables gates between non-nearest neighbors. cf. Ref. [17]. While similar concepts could be implemented with RE ions, we do not pursue this route here.",
                "The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we propose our RE-based qubits and discuss necessary and desirable CF properties of their host material. We describe how to carry out fast single-qubit gates in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we present the core idea: the implementation of a CNOT gate between RE qubits via magnetic dipolar interactions. A discussion of the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computing [18], in particular the stability of the qubits that are not directly addressed in one-and two-qubit operations as well as the selective addressability of individual qubits, is given in Appendix C. We compare our scheme with the CNOT implementation via the dipole blockade and to the Si:P proposal of Hill et al. [15] in Sec. V. Finally, Sec. VI contains a case study of erbium-doped Y 2 SiO 5 as a promising material for implementing our ideas, and in Sec. VII we summarize the main results."

We use the ground state and one excited spin-orbit manifold, requiring the lowest-lying states of both manifolds to be CF doublets with different anisotropy directions, which we then Zeeman split with an external field. From the ground state doublet we only need the lower Zeeman state. The coupling to a nuclear spin with I = 1/2 splits the electronic states into pairs of hyperfine states, where the nuclear spins are either aligned or antialigned with the electronic spin. The spatial density of the RE ions is adjusted such that the dipolar interactions J dip have by far the smallest energy scale (apart from the nuclear Zeeman energy). An analogous bound applies to the operation temperature T.",

The effect of the crystal environment on the RE ions is captured by the CF potential [19,20]. It breaks the spherical symmetry of the isolated ion and splits its (2J + 1)-fold degenerate J manifold into CF levels, whose degeneracy and magnetic properties depend on the point symmetry of the RE site in the crystal. The splitting between different J manifolds is governed by Hund's rules and is typically very large, J /h \u223c 100 THz. Within a given J manifold, the single-ion Hamiltonian consists of the CF potential (H CF ), Zeeman terms (H Z,e + H Z,n ) in the presence of an external magnetic field B, and the hyperfine interaction (H HF ) between the electronic spin, J , and the nuclear spin, I ,",
                "In Fig. 2 we illustrate the hierarchy of the terms in Hamiltonian (1) of the ideal qubit setup. The CF potential V CF ( J ) induces the largest splitting within a given J manifold, typically of the order of hundreds of gigahertz up to several terahertz. The electronic Zeeman term with the Land\u00e9 factor g J lifts the degeneracy of time-reversal-symmetryprotected Kramers doublets. It induces a splitting linear in the field, of the order of about 2\u03bc B /h \u2248 30 GHz/T. These two terms determine the electronic level structure, which we use to coherently manipulate the electronic wavefunctions of the RE ions. The hyperfine interactions with the nuclear spin I are usually well captured by a contact interaction of the form J \u2022 I with the hyperfine constant A J ; typically, A J /h is of the order of gigahertz. This interaction is used to transfer quantum information from nuclear to electronic degrees of freedom, and back. Since the hyperfine interaction is much smaller than the electronic Zeeman splitting, its main effect is to (anti)align the nuclear spins with the polarized magnetic moments of the electronic doublet states. In the theoretical discussion of this paper, for simplicity, we assume the nuclear spin to be I = 1/2, but similar reasonings and results apply to larger nuclear spins, for example, in the showcase material Er 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 with I = 7/2.",

We make use of the interaction between excited electronic states to build a gate between two qubits located at a finite spatial distance.

In the following, we always assume the dipole interaction to be much smaller than the hyperfine splitting, which is the case for qubit distances exceeding r",
                "Because of the tiny nuclear moment \u03bc N , the nuclear Zeeman term and dipolar interactions involving nuclear spins have much smaller energy scales. For our scheme, the Zeeman term only plays an indirect role, insofar as it increases the fidelity of our two-qubit gate by tuning off resonance a class of undesired higher-order spin-flip processes that could occur while carrying out the gate operation. The effects of dipolar interactions between electronic and nuclear spins is analyzed in Appendix C 3, where we conclude that they are negligible. The purely nuclear dipole interactions create entanglement between the nuclear spin qubits on a timescale corresponding to (\u03bc B /\u03bc N ) 2 \u223c 10 6 two-qubit operations, which constitutes an intrinsic decoherence time of the qubits."

                "To achieve long coherence times, we store the quantum information in the nuclear spin states (|+ n , |n ) on Kramers RE ions, whose electron shell is in its ground state. These nuclear states serve as memory or \"passive\" qubits. We denote their states as |0 pas and |1 pas , respectively. Given the small magnetic moments of the nuclear spins, they hardly interact with each other. Moreover, they couple to phonons only very weakly (indirectly via the electrons), so their coherence time is much larger than that of electronic states. Coherence times of such hyperfine states of up to six hours have been measured in RE systems [3].",
                "For the electronic dipolar interaction (2) not to entangle the passive qubits, we require a nondegenerate electronic ground state |GS e [21], which is achieved by polarizing electronic doublets with a magnetic field. We further assume that all RE ions can be cooled efficiently (e.g., by pumping schemes involving higher excited CF states, as demonstrated in Refs. [2,6,22,23]) to occupy that state. Because of the relative smallness of the dipolar interaction compared with the Zeeman splitting (provided that the RE ions are far enough apart in the host medium, J dip /(\u03bc B B) \u223c 10 -6 for distances r = 10 nm and B = 1 T), we can neglect dipole-induced spin-flip terms in the electronic ground state. This effectively \"switches off\" the electronic interaction between the passive qubits [24].",
                "Since the passive qubits are well protected on the timescales discussed above, their quantum information needs to be transferred to \"active\" qubits before one can implement efficient quantum gates on them. A natural candidate for an active qubit is a doublet of excited CF states, which we denote by |\u2191 e ,|\u2193 e . In general, these have sizable magnetic moments of a few \u03bc B , which allow them to interact with other active qubits through dipolar coupling. The hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spin splits each of these CF states into a pair of hyperfine states, similarly as in the passive ground state. One level of either hyperfine pair is selected to represent one of the two active qubit states |0 act and |1 act . To limit decay processes, it is best to choose the qubit state |0 act as the lowest of the four hyperfine states. This leaves us with two choices of how to assign the other qubit state |1 act to either of the two hyperfine levels of the higher-lying Zeeman state. Accordingly, we distinguish between an electronuclear qubit and a purely electronic qubit, respectively, referring to the degrees of freedom in which the two qubit states differ; see Fig. 3. The choice of the optimal active qubit with respect to the CNOT gate fidelity is discussed in Sec. IV.",
                "It is advantageous to further require that the doublets of electronic ground and excited states come with different g-factor anisotropy and therefore favor different magnetization directions. This excludes implementations with cubic point symmetries at the RE site. The different anisotropies help to reduce the single-qubit gate time by allowing for an efficient implementation of nuclear spin flips in the ground state by driving optical transitions via the excited doublet states since there is significant overlap between all nuclear spin states in the ground and excited doublets. Vastly different anisotropies are unusual, and a vanishing perpendicular g factor g \u22a5 [25] requires special symmetries at the RE sites: tetragonal symmetry with J = 3/2, or trigonal or hexagonal symmetry with J > 1/2; see Table I in Appendix D for more details on the symmetry constraints. Nonetheless, as long as the anisotropies of the ground and excited state doublets differ sufficiently, one can carry out fast single-qubit gates.",
                "Finite perpendicular g factors cannot occur for non-Kramers doublets. Thus, it is impossible to obtain nonparallel magnetization directions for different doublets in these systems [26]. We therefore restrict ourselves to Kramers ions. To electrically gate such Kramers ions, as discussed in the Appendix C2, one needs a material where the RE site does not contain an inversion symmetry such that all CF states have a finite electrical dipole moment [27].",
                "To achieve long lifetimes of the active qubits, the active excited doublet should be the lowest CF level of a higherlying J manifold, whose gap to lower J manifolds is significantly larger than the Debye frequency. Under these conditions, the active qubit state |0 act can only decay via multiphonon emission or slow photon emission [28]. The decay rate of the excited Zeeman state due to phonon emission is generally very small as well, since the Debye density of states at the frequency of the Zeeman splitting is tiny. Indeed, lifetimes as long as 60 s have been reported, e.g., in (the ground state doublet of) erbium-doped Y 2 SiO 5 [29].",
                "To activate qubits (i.e., to transfer the quantum wavefunction from a nuclear spin to electronic degrees of freedom), one can use laser pulses that are resonant with specific transitions in the level scheme shown in Fig. 3. By coupling to the transition dipole moments between CF states, one can coherently manipulate their populations via Rabi oscillations, as demonstrated, for example, in Refs. [1,2,30,31]."

However, this has the severe drawback that the coupling to the nuclear moment is very weak, which implies very long gate times of the order of t \u223c /(\u03bc N B ac ) = 21 \u03bcs (for an amplitude of the driving field of B ac = 1mT). Similar qubit proposals based on phosphorus donors in silicon as in Refs. [15,32] suffer from this problem [33].",
                "Here we present a much faster alternative, which takes advantage of the nonparallel magnetic polarizations in ground and excited electronic doublet states. The latter implies that the nuclear spin is not conserved upon switching between ground and excited electronic states. This allows us to drive transitions between the passive qubit levels by passing via excited doublet states, which merely requires coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom. For example, an X gate, i.e., a logical spin flip, is achieved with three consecutive laser pulses, as sketched in Fig. 4. In this scheme, the gate time is limited by the inverse of the electronic matrix elements, which are typically much larger than the Zeeman coupling to the nuclear moments.",
                "The speedup of this method depends on selection rules, which involve the value of J in the ground and excited doublet states. The largest speedup is achieved if magnetic dipole transitions are allowed between the ground and excited J manifolds, i.e., if J = 0, \u00b11 [34]. As compared with the direct manipulation of the nuclear spin, one achieves speedup by a factor of the order of \u03bc B /(3\u03bc N ) = 600 [35]. The corresponding gate time is of the order of FIG. 4. Implementation of a fast X gate via an excited state. The blue arrows denote \u03c0 pulses that switch the population of the states they connect. The pulses are applied in the order of the indicated numbers. The differing g-factor anisotropies in the ground and excited doublets ensure sizable matrix elements for all three transitions. t \u223c 3 /(\u03bc B B ac ) = 35 ns for an amplitude of the laser field of B ac = 1 mT. This concept of nonparallel g factors in different CF doublets has been used in, e.g., Refs. [1,2,30] in order to measure spin-echo coherence times."

So far we have neglected the transverse (non-Ising) parts of the hyperfine and dipolar interactions, that is, those terms that flip one or both (electronic or nuclear) spins within the excited doublet states. This is motivated by the fact that if we choose to use active electronuclear qubits (and also for electronic qubits, if we assume that g \u22a5 = 0), spinflip terms appear only in higher-order perturbation theory in the transverse terms in Hamiltonian (2). Nevertheless, such transverse perturbations can become important if they connect states that are close in energy.",

Indeed, this leaves only one residual resonant process that has an initial state in the twoqubit subspace. The optimal choice, as well as the resulting fidelity, depend on whether or not the transverse g factor of the excited doublet vanishes. If g \u22a5 = 0, there are no residual interactions that act directly within the excited doublet. Any non-Ising matrix elements are thus due to tunneling through intermediate, higher-lying CF states. This reduces the magnitude of residual matrix elements and therefore leads to a high fidelity of our CNOT implementation. Typically, the electronic active qubit is the better choice in this case. The intrinsic gate error due to the non-Ising terms is then limited by the off-resonant nuclear or electronuclear \"spin flip-flops\"; see Fig. 5(b).

Here the qubits consist either of two electronic CF states or of two hyperfine levels of a single electronic level. An auxiliary state, to which one qubit state can be excited, is needed as well. All these states interact via their magnetic or electronic dipole moments. For RE ions, magnetic and electric dipolar interactions are usually of similar strength, since the electric dipole moments are typically very small, while typical magnetic moments are fairly large.",

Through its dipolar interaction with the target qubit, the level structure of the latter is changed. Now a sequence of three pulses, whose frequencies match the unmodified level structure of the target qubit, is applied. This swaps states |0 and |1 of the target qubit, but only if the control qubit is left in state |1 , since the pulse sequence is off-resonant if the control qubit is excited; see Fig. 6. After this conditional swap, the control qubit is brought back to its initial state.",

A swap is thus only carried out if the control qubit is in state |1 . The indices \"ctrl\" and \"tar\" denote the control and target qubits, respectively.",
                "where the dipolar interaction is much smaller than the experimentally achievable Rabi frequencies, such that our scheme can be applied (while in the opposite limit only the dipole blockade can be used). This is the regime of qubit distances beyond r [\u03bc 0 \u03bc B /(4\u03c0 B ac )] 1/3 \u2248 1 nm (with B ac = 1 mT). Here our CNOT implementation is significantly faster, since, being based on the state-dependent phase accumulation, it makes use of the full interaction strength between two RE ions, achieving a gate time equal to t CNOT \u2248 \u03c0/(4J dip ). Thereby the interaction strength needs to be known precisely, and the gate duration has to be adjusted accordingly. The dipole blockade instead relies on the ability to resolve the frequency shift induced by the dipole interaction. This requires Rabi frequencies smaller than the interaction strength and consequently gate times that are substantially longer than in our scheme. We estimate the gate time of the dipole blockade in Appendix A by minimizing the \u03c0 -pulse duration for a fixed fidelity goal. We numerically evaluated the unitary time evolution in the rotating-wave approximation and optimized with respect to both the pulse cutoff T cut and the Gaussian pulse width T, such that, for all detunings larger than J dip , the gate error is below a threshold value 1 -F. Like for our direct gate, the gate time of the dipole blockade is proportional to /J dip , but, in addition, it grows logarithmically with the desired gate fidelity; see Fig. 7. Therefore, if one requires gate errors to be less than 10 -4 , the indirect dipole blockade is a factor of roughly 50 slower than our gate.",
                "In Fig. 7 we show that the minimal gate time required in the dipole blockade increases monotonically with the required fidelity, but does so in an oscillatory manner. This originates from Rabi-like oscillations of the (unwanted) transition probability, which in turn result from the nonadiabatic switching on and off of the pulses at t = \u00b1T cut ; see Appendix A for a detailed calculation. Viewing the fidelity as a function of the \u03c0 -pulse duration T \u03c0 = 2T cut , the local maxima of the fidelity are spaced by T \u03c0 = 4\u03c0/ \u03c9 dip .  CNOT implementation is reduced as compared with that of a dipole-blockade scheme carried out with Gaussian pulses (assuming that the dipolar interaction is smaller than the hyperfine splitting and the largest achievable Rabi frequencies). The speedup increases logarithmically with the maximally admissible gate error 1 -F that we assume to be given by the probability of a nonresonant excitation (rather than by the decoherence time of the qubits). The oscillatory behavior traces back to Rabi oscillations in the unwanted transition probability.",
                "We note that a CNOT gate speedup implies that the gate error due to the finite decoherence time in Eq. ( 7) is smaller by the same factor in our scheme as compared with the dipole blockade. This allows for the entanglement of qubits at longer distances with better (coherence-limited) fidelity in our scheme. On the other hand, the dipole blockade has the advantage that it can also be used in the regime where the dipolar interaction is larger than the hyperfine splitting. Thus, for very close-by qubits (r 1 nm), the dipole blockade is the faster gate. If such neighbors could be addressed individually (by magnetic adatoms or gating) in an experimental setting, an approach that combines dipole blockade and the scheme presented here might be used to entangle close and distant pairs of qubits, respectively.",
                "Note that the dipole blockade does not require precise knowledge of the dipolar interaction strength, as long as it is large enough. In contrast, our two-qubit gate does require that knowledge. This is, however, not a substantial drawback, since the interaction depends only on the atomic positions in the crystal, which are very stable over time. It thus suffices to initially characterize the interactions with a precision higher than the desired gate fidelity, so as to ensure precise gates with well-timed pulse sequences."

                "Our scheme resembles in several aspects that proposed for phosphorus donors in Ref. [15], where the nuclear spins of 31 P + are used to store quantum information. In contrast to our scheme, the donors have no electronic spin. Instead, they are tunnel coupled to single-electron transistor structures. By gating these, an extra electron is loaded into a spin-down state onto the donor. This operation is equivalent to our gate tuning the RE qubits by a local Stark shift, which singles out the qubits that are later selectively addressed. In the proposal of Ref. [15], resonant microwave pulses then transfer the stored quantum information from the nuclear spins to the electronic states. This is the analog of the activation step of our electronic qubits. Two active qubits interact by dipolar interactions, and the CNOT gate is realized in a similar way as we discuss in this paper. In comparison with donors in silicon, our scheme has several advantages. (i) The magnetic moment of (effective) RE spins are much larger (typically, by a factor of 5-7) than those of single electrons. This allows for a much shorter two-qubit gate time, which is inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic moment entering the dipole interaction. (ii) Our single-qubit gate time is up to approximately 600 times faster since we can make use of the hyperfine interaction and manipulate the nuclear spin states via electronic transitions instead of coupling electromagnetic pulses directly to the nuclear spins. (iii) The qubit activation in our scheme is simpler and does not involve a charge transfer over interatomic distances (with associated dipole moments and the danger of exciting the lattice). This is likely to reduce the activation error."

This leads to a coherencetime-limited gate fidelity of the CNOT implementation, with F min \u2248 99.9% and a total gate time of 4.2 \u03bcs.

Our scheme constitutes a promising platform for universal quantum computing. We use nearly decoupled passive (memory) qubits and transfer them to less protected active qubits only when they are involved in a twoqubit gate. The passive qubits are well-protected nuclear spin states serving as quantum memory. The active qubit states are magnetized electronic states that can interact over relatively long distances.",
                "The central idea of this paper is to implement a CNOT gate based on the phase accumulation due to the Ising-like dipole interaction between two active qubits. This achieves a speedup by up to two orders of magnitude as compared with the standard dipole blockade, in the regime where dipolar interactions are weak as compared with typical optical Rabi frequencies and the hyperfine splitting (i.e., for qubits spaced by more than of the order of 1 nm).",
                "The level scheme of a single ion (illustrated in Fig. 2) should have the following essential ingredients: (i) a Zeeman-split magnetic ground state; (ii) a nuclear spin and strong hyperfine interactions; (iii) a doublet state at the bottom of an excited J manifold, having a magnetic anisotropy differing from that of the ground state. The last requirement can only be met with Kramers RE ions with noncubic point symmetry groups. Our estimation of gate errors due to residual (non-Ising) interactions suggest that typically the two-qubit gate fidelity is limited by the coherence time T 2 of the active qubit. Using a crystal where the RE site has no inversion symmetry generally allows for electrical gating of the qubits and thereby assures that individual qubits can be addressed selectively.",

Given the possibilities offered by isotope enrichment and semiconductor processing, we believe silicon doped with RE ions [42,43] to be a very promising platform.",

                "First let us discuss the magnitudes of the magnetic and electric dipolar interactions. As mentioned in the main text, the 4f configurations of RE ions have fairly small electric dipole moments. On the other hand, one can have large magnetic moments that compensate for the weaker magnetic interaction. As a consequence, it turns out that the magnetic and electric dipole interactions are typically comparable in magnitude. For example, in the material Eu 3+ :Y 2 SiO 5 , proposed in Ref. [14] as a candidate material for quantum computing, the electric dipole moments of ground and excited manifolds differ by \u03bc e = 7.7 \u00d7 10 -32 C m. Typical (differences of) dipole moments are smaller than this value, but of a similar order of magnitude. A magnetic moment of only \u03bc m = 2.5\u03bc B of the doublet states leads to the same interaction strength between the two active qubits, assuming vacuum permittivity, i.e., \u03bc 2 e / 0 \u2248 \u03bc 2 m /\u03bc 0 . For a distance r 12 = 10 nm between qubits 1 and 2, the electric dipole shift between RE ions is \u03c9 dip \u223c ( \u03bc e ) 2 /(4 0 \u03c0 r 3  12 ). This evaluates to \u03c9 dip = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 80 kHz/[(r 12 /10 nm) 3 ], which is much smaller than the typical hyperfine splittings of RE ions. It is also much smaller than the highest experimentally achievable Rabi frequencies for electric dipole transitions. This implies that it is the smallness of the dipolar shift in the spectrum that limits the gating time. Indeed, if the swapping operation on the target qubit is to take place only if the control qubit is in state |1 , the Rabi frequency of the three pulses used to swap the target qubit must be significantly smaller than the dipolar shift. In our implementation, the gating time is instead limited by the time evolution under the magnetic dipole interaction, leading to a gate time of t CNOT \u2248 \u03c0/(4J dip ), where the dipolar interaction strength is comparable with the dipole energy shift above \u03c9 dip \u223c J dip / . The advantage of our scheme is that the system entanglement follows directly from the dynamics governed by this Hamiltonian. Below we estimate the speedup of our implementation compared with the dipole-blockade scheme with Gaussian pulses."

Our goal is to optimize the two parameters T cut and 0 such as to minimize the \u03c0 -pulse duration for a given desired CNOT gate fidelity F and dipolar frequency shift \u03c9 dip = J dip / .

For each T cut , we find the smallest detuning \u03c9 such that, for all larger detunings, the gate error is below some desired threshold. From this we deduce the minimal T cut in units of 1/ \u03c9. The result is shown in Fig. 8, where we plot the maximal error 1 -F \u03c0 of the optimized pulse as a function of its duration. For truncated Gaussian pulses, we find that T \u03c0 grows logarithmically with (1 -F \u03c0 ) -1 and exhibits 4\u03c0/ \u03c9 periodic oscillations in log(1 -F \u03c0 ).",

                "(1) A scalable physical system with well-characterized qubits.-In our case the well-characterized single RE ions serve as qubits, as described in the main text. Scalability and the addressability of single qubits will be discussed in the next subsection. ( 2 gates can be implemented efficiently, as described in Sec. III. To realize a universal set of quantum gates, one needs only one entangling two-qubit gate [36]. We choose to implement the CNOT gate; see Sec. IV A. Our implementation is about two orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed implementations based on the dipole blockade. (5) A qubit-specific measurement capability.-In principle, one could measure single RE spins by detecting the emission of a photon after excitation to a high-energy manifold [4,5]. However, since singlephoton measurements have low fidelities, repeated measurements would have to be made; since the emission process destroys quantum information, this approach is not viable for our RE qubits. The readout fidelity and rate can be increased by cavity integration. Such setups have been demonstrated in, for example, Refs. [6,8,48,49]. A further possibility to read out the qubits consists in measuring the RE charge state after an optical excitation. Such single-ion measurements have been demonstrated, for example, with erbium defects in silicon [42].",
                "Another way to measure RE spins was suggested in Ref. [14]: a different RE ion nearby may serve as the readout ion. One then uses the electric (or magnetic) dipole blockade to shift the transition frequencies of the readout ion. If the qubit to be measured is in state |0 , an external laser excites the readout ion and emission can be detected. The excitation and the emission measurement can be repeated without altering the qubit information (apart from the initial wavefunction collapse that projects onto the eigenstate basis of the qubit), assuming that the excited readout ion decays back to its ground state sufficiently rapidly and that there is no component of its wavefunction that becomes entangled with the qubit ions. Alternatively, we could also perform a CNOT operation analogous to the two-qubit gate, with the qubit as the control bit and the readout ion (in its ground state) as the target bit. This allows for a faster readout than the dipoleblockade scheme, as discussed below, but it necessitates more control over the readout ion. The requirements for the readout ion are discussed in Ref. [14]. We note that this method of readout adds more complexity to the system as compared with a cavity integration and might therefore be less favorable."

Below we address this issue explicitly.",
                "Our scheme implements single-qubit manipulations by resonant electromagnetic pulses. These should address one and only one qubit at a time. In general, one will spatially separate the qubits and work with dilute magnetic RE ions, using materials in which most RE sites are occupied by nonmagnetic ions, e.g., trivalent yttrium. Nevertheless, the distance between qubits will still be much smaller than the wavelength of the laser light used for the various gate operations, such that a laser cannot be focused on a single qubit [50]. Therefore, moderate dilution by nonmagnetic ions is by itself insufficient to ensure the selective addressability of single qubits. This problem can be overcome by locally altering the gap between the electronic ground state doublet and the excited state doublet of the RE ion to be addressed.",
                "Addressability by static modulation.-If scalability is not an immediate concern, but the aim is merely to selectively address and entangle a few qubits (which is sufficient, e.g., for quantum repeaters), one can achieve a spatially restricted, static modulation of qubit parameters with polarized magnetic adatoms, most easily realized by another species of RE that will be subject to the same (polarizing) external field already imposed on the qubit atoms. Similar ideas to address qubits by statically shifting transition frequencies have been proposed previously (see, e.g., Refs. [14,51,52]), where naturally occurring local strains in the material are exploited to individually address RE ions due to their shifted transition energies. This allows addressing of even single ions, as demonstrated in, e.g., Refs. [6,8,9,53,54]. Strains can also be engineered by adding adatoms, as shown in Ref. [55]. We suggest to further induce local strains or varying crystal fields by engineering the thickness of the top and bottom layers of the crystal for a two-dimensional array of qubits, as discussed below (see also Fig. 9). These methods could also be combined with the dynamic addressing based on electrical gating below.",
                "Addressability by dynamic modulation.-For a quantum computer, it is more convenient to generate the spatial modulation of transition frequencies dynamically. To achieve this, we propose to apply local electric fields by local gating. An electric field induces a Stark shift in all CF levels that have electric dipole moments. An array of gates similar to a setup proposed in Ref. [15] for phosphorus donors in silicon or in Ref. [14] for Eu ions doped into a Y 2 SiO 5 matrix allows tuning of selected RE ions into resonance with a particular laser resonance line, so as to either activate a qubit or perform selective singlequbit operations, as sketched in Fig. 9. The point groups for which the Kramers doublets always have electric dipole moments-and therefore allow for electrical gating-are highlighted in bold in Table I in Appendix D.",

We use a truncated Gaussian pulse with the activation (or single-qubit gate) time t act \u2248 2 \u221a \u03c0/ act , where act is the Rabi frequency. For simplicity, we assume the same Stark detuning for all N nontargeted qubits within the laser spot size.",
                "To achieve an activation fidelity (i.e., single-qubit gate fidelity) F act , the Rabi frequency needs to be smaller than act \u03c9 St \u03c0/(2 log{N \u03c0 2 /[4(1 -F act )]}), as we show in Eq. (B3), and thus the activation time is larger than t act 2 \u221a \u03c0/ act . On the other hand, to achieve a CNOT fidelity F CNOT , the activation has to be faster than the bound given by the second term in Eq. (7). Combining these two restrictions, the required Stark detuning between targeted and nontargeted qubits can be estimated as",
                "We consider two levels of desired fidelities, F act = F CNOT = 99% (a lower bound required for topological error correcting codes [56]) and F act = F CNOT = 99.99%. Assuming a qubit spacing of r = 10nm and a laser spot size of approximately 1 \u03bcm 2 (i.e., N \u223c 10 4 affected qubits) with a Stark coefficient \u2202\u03bd St /\u2202E = 35kHz/(V/cm) as for Eu-doped Y 2 SiO 5 , this requires a difference of electric fields acting on targeted and nontargeted qubits of E = \u03c9 St /(2\u03c0\u2202\u03bd St /\u2202E) 50-600 V/cm. Such field strengths are indeed realistic to achieve in an experimental setting.",
                "To electrically gate any selected qubit, one needs to arrange the qubits in a two-dimensional array. This can be achieved, e.g., by growing a single layer containing dilute magnetic ions on top of bulk material that contains no RE qubits, and covering it with a thin layer of magnetically inert bulk material. This could be realized, e.g., using liquid phase epitaxy [57][58][59] or pulsed laser deposition [60][61][62] with first results reviewed in Ref. [63]. Another route is to implant RE ions in silicon [64][65][66][67], which would allow us to profit from the advanced technology developed for silicon electronics [68]. Single-ion implantation with secondary electron detection for feedback enables the high-fidelity fabrication of two-dimensional arrays of implanted ions [67]. If methods are used that incorporate RE atoms with considerable positional randomness (unlike in Ref. [67]), the RE layer in Fig. 9 will need to be surveyed to identify those atoms usable for qubits and quantum gates. Approaches could include superresolution or near-field microscopy where we take advantage of the strong fluorescence of the RE ions. Voltages applied to the gating grids could tune in and tune out the fluorescence response and so locate the RE atoms with respect to the gating grids."

These induce errors that cannot be eliminated by the Stark shift above and are therefore intrinsic to our scheme. We argue below that these errors are extremely small and most likely negligible compared with other error sources.",
                "During (de)activation pulses, one potential source of error is flips of the electronic or nuclear spins of nontargeted RE ions induced by the time-varying dipolar field of the addressed RE ion. However, the dipolar fields that drive those transitions are much weaker than the fields associated with activation pulses, and thus are a subdominant source of dephasing [69]. In addition to spinflip errors, the dipolar field during the pulses results in accumulated phases on the surrounding passive qubits. This error is also negligible since the phase amounts to at most \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c J dip (\u03bc N /\u03bc B )(t act / ) \u223c \u03bc 0 \u03bc N /(4\u03c0 r 3 B ac ) \u223c 5 \u00d7 10 -7 per single-qubit operation for experimental pulses B ac = 1mT and a qubit spacing of r = 10nm.

                "The last error source that we have to consider is due to interactions between active qubits and nearby passive qubits during two-qubit gate operations where the targeted RE ions stay activated for an extended period. These interactions can be described in terms of a dipolar field that depends on the active qubit's state and acts on the passive qubits. The field can be decomposed into components parallel and transverse to the existing average local field on the passive qubit. The effect of the longitudinal part cancels out once a spin echo (within the active qubit) is applied, as is indeed the case for our CNOT scheme. However, the transverse part of the field induces a second-order correction to the level splitting, which does not reverse under the spin echo. This results in a deterministic phase accumulation in the passive qubits. The (distance-dependent) phase factor \u03b4\u03c6 for nearby ions is of order \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c A",
