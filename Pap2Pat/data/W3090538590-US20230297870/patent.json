    "abstract": "A universal quantum computing system uses electro-nuclear wavefunctions of rare-earth ions embedded in an insulating solid state matrix. Each rare-earth ion represents a nuclear qubit that can be selectively operated as a passive or active qubit. The passive qubit is a passive electronic doublet at a non-degenerate ground state that stores the quantum information in the two different nuclear spin states possible in the non-degenerate ground state causing two different passive-state electro-nuclear wavefunctions. The active qubit is an active electronic doublet at a non-degenerate excited state that stores the quantum information in the two different nuclear spin states possible in the non-degenerate excited state. A laser source generates laser pulses to optically excite the rare-earth ions from the non-degenerate ground state into the non-degenerate excited state and vice versa, to locally control the electronic dipolar interaction in a tunable manner among at least two active qubits.",

The nuclear spins and the electronic crystal field (CF) levels of RE ions can be used to store and manipulate quantum states. Due to the long decoherence times of the quantum states of RE ions, they are well-suited for the implementation of qubits. Dephasing times ranging from 100 \u03bcs for electronic transitions between CF states, to 1.3 s for nuclear transitions and even up to six hours by employing dynamical decoupling have been recently demonstrated."

In that scheme, the dipole field from the control qubit may shift the transition frequencies of the target qubit. This is used to implement a CNOT gate with a sequence of pulses, which is effective only if the control bit is in the logical 1-state.",
                        "It is therefore the objective to provide an universal quantum computing system that allows for fast and secure processing of the stored binary coded information.",
                        "This objective is achieved according to the present invention by an universal quantum computing system using electro-nuclear wavefunctions of rare-earth ions, comprising:\n\n\n- - a) a 2d-matrix of rare-earth ions being embedded in an insulating\n    solid state matrix, wherein:\n  - b) each rare-earth ion representing a nuclear qubit that can be\n    selectively operated as a passive qubit or as an active qubit;\n  - c) said passive qubit being represented by a passive electronic\n    doublet at a non-degenerate ground state thereby storing the quantum\n    information in the two different nuclear pin states possible in this\n    non-degenerate ground state causing two different passive-state\n    electro-nuclear wavefunctions, and\n  - d) said active qubit being represented by an active electronic\n    doublet at a non-degenerate excited state thereby storing the\n    quantum information in the two different nuclear pin states possible\n    in this non-degenerate excited state causing to different\n    active-state electro-nuclear wavefunctions, and\n  - e) a laser source for selectively generating laser pulses in order\n    to optically excite the rare-earth ions from the non-degenerated\n    ground state into the non-degenerate excited state and vice versa,\n    thereby locally controlling the electronic dipolar interaction in a\n    tunable manner among at least two active qubits, and\n  - f) an external electrical field in form of switchable electric gates\n    for inducing a Stark shift for a selectable qubit, and\n  - g) an external magnetic field.",
                        "Using the above ingredients, it is possible to implement a qubit logic, such as a CNOT gate, using the Ising-like dipole interaction between two active qubits. This achieves a speed-up by up to two orders of magnitude as compared to standard dipole blockade systems. A decisive advantage of the inventive scheme as compared to many others lies in the fact that the selective activation and the slow power law decay of the dipole interaction allows gates between relatively distant qubits, even if many non-activated qubits are located between the two qubits that are being coupled. In contrast to similar schemes which also use nuclear spins as passive qubits, one can reach a speed-up for single-qubit gates by a factor of order 600. This is achieved by coupling to electronic instead of nuclear matrix elements which is possible due to different g-factors in the ground state and the excited doublets. Furthermore, the use of the effective spin of a RE shell (as opposed to spins of single electrons as in phosphorous doped silicon) allows for larger magnetic moments of several PE. At equal distances of qubits, the dipolar interaction is enhanced by the square of the larger magnetic moment and the two-qubit gate time is accordingly reduced by an order of magnitude. Thus, the present invention discloses the implementation of RE qubits with coupled electro-nuclear degrees of freedom and fast single-qubit and CNOT gates that can entangle not only nearest neighbors, but also relatively distant qubits in an array. Combined with the readout capability of single ions and the possibility of coupling RE ions to optical modes, networks of such ions are appropriate for scalable quantum computing systems.",
                        "A preferred embodiment of the present invention can be achieved when the 2d-matrix is realized by growing a single layer containing dilute magnetic RE ions on top of a bulk material that contains no RE qubits and covering this layer with a thin layer of magnetically inert bulk material or alternatively by the single ion implantation of the RE ions in bulk silicon.",
                        "A preferred embodiment with detailed feasibility can be achieved when the 2d-matrix is a LiYF4 bulk material being doped with 167Er3+ ions.",
                        "The present invention discloses a faster two-qubit gate based on the magnetic dipole interaction, which is inspired by two-qubit gates implemented using phosphorus donors in silicon and is similar to hybrid electron and nuclear spin schemes in nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond.",
                        "The basic principle of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1 and the underpinning hierarchy of relevant energy scales in FIG. 2, while the full scheme is illustrated in FIG. 5. In the present invention, the quantum information is stored in nuclear spin states in the presence of a non-degenerate electronic ground state. Those are ideal as quantum memories due to their weak interactions with the environment. To implement single-qubit and two-qubit gates, hyperfine interactions and optical pulses are exploited to transfer the wavefunctions of the nuclear spins to \u2018active qubits\u2019 consisting of excited electronic doublet states that carry a large magnetic moment. Two such active qubits interact at relatively long distances via magnetic dipolar interactions. By making use of the non-trivial unitary evolution of the active qubits under this Hamiltonian, the full interaction strength can be exploited to execute the gate. This reduces the gate time by up to two orders of magnitude as compared to the dipole blockade scheme.",
                        "FIG. 1 shows the basic principle of the quantum computing scheme. The passive (memory) qubit consists of nuclear degrees of freedom in the presence of polarized electronic RE spins. Their strong hyperfine coupling allows for rapid single qubit operations. Even though the electronic spins create substantial internal fields, they are essentially static and much smaller than the hyperfine splitting, and thus do not dephase. The nuclear qubits can be selectively activated by optical excitation to a (locally tunable) electronic CF doublet with a large magnetic moment. Two activated qubits communicate via the electronic dipolar interaction, allowing for fast two-qubit gates over distances as large as 10 nm. On the other hand, their entanglement with the qubits that remain passive is stable up to timescales far in excess of the gate operation time because the magnetic dipole interaction between electrons is much less than the chosen Zeeman energy polarizing the electrons. This also implies that the entanglement among the qubits \u201cleft behind\u201d by the selective optical excitation remains unaffected",
                        "The present invention differs significantly from proposals based on exchange coupled donors, for example in silicon. Those entangle spins indirectly via an effective interaction mediated by an electronic wavefunction. The radius of this wavefunction is manipulated optically or with electrical gates and tunes the hyperfine interaction strength between nuclei and electrons. Thereby the effective interaction between qubits is switched on and off. The present scheme instead entangles nuclear spins by use of the dipolar interaction between electron spins. The latter offers great freedom in choosing the pairs of qubits to be entangled\u2014in contrast to the spatial constraints inherent to schemes where the qubit interaction is due to controlling the spatial extent of electronic wavefunctions and their overlaps.",
                        "It is noted that the present quantum computing scheme shares several similarities with the ones for phosphorous donors in silicon. Similarly, presently one uses nuclear spins as passive qubits, dipole-coupled active qubits and essentially the same CNOT implementation. However, the present scheme features several additional advantages which we will discuss in Sec. \u201cComparison to implementation with phosphorous donors in silicon\u201d.",
                        "The present disclosure is organized as follows: In Sec. \u201cSet-up and Hamiltonian\u201d a quantum computing scheme is explained based on a RE system and necessary and desirable properties of its crystal field levels are discussed. It is described how to carry out fast single-qubit gates in Sec. \u201cSingle-qubit gates\u201d. In Sec. \u201cTwo-qubit operations\u201d the implementation of a CNOT gate via magnetic dipolar interactions is implemented. The DiVinvenzo criteria for quantum computing, and in particular the stability of qubits which are not directly addressed in specific one- and two-qubit operations, are considered in Sec. \u201cDiVincenzo criteria and addressability of single qubits\u201d. The present scheme is compared to the CNOT implementation via the dipole blockade in Sec. \u201cComparison to similar schemes\u201d. Further, experimental considerations are discussed in Sec. \u201cDiscussion\u201d and a case study of erbium-doped LiYF4 is presented. Finally, the main results are presented in Sec. \u201cConclusion\u201d."

This potential breaks the spherical symmetry of the isolated ion and splits its (2J+1)-fold degenerate J-manifold into crystal field levels, whose degeneracy and magnetic properties depend on the point symmetry of the RE site in the crystal. The splitting between different J-manifolds is governed by Hund's rules and is typically very large, \u0394J/h\u02dc100 THz. Within a given J-manifold the single-ion Hamiltonian consists of the CF potential HCF, Zeeman terms (HZ, e+HZ, n) (in the presence of an external magnetic field B) and the hyperfine interaction HHF between the electronic spin, vec{J}, and the nuclear spin, vec{I},",

It induces a splitting linear in the field, of the order of \u02dc2 \u03bcB/h\u224830 GHz/T.

The hyperfine splitting of magnetic CF states (in a manifold with non-zero vec{J} and vec{L} is typically of the order of AJ/h\u02dcGHz.

The required detuning between neighboring RE sites is of the order of the hopping energy, which amounts to about \u0394\u03bd\u02dc1-10Hz for a qubit spacing of r=10 nm, depending on whether or not the perpendicular g-factor vanishes in the ground state.

In general, those have sizable magnetic moments of a few \u03bcB, which allow them to interact with other active qubits through dipolar coupling. The interaction with the nuclear spin splits each of these CF states into a pair of hyperfine states, one of which needs to be selected to represent the active qubit. To limit decay processes, it is best to choose the qubit state |0act as the lowest of the four hyperfine states. This leaves two choices of how to assign the other qubit state |1act to either of the two hyperfine levels of the higher lying Zeeman state. Accordingly, it is distinguished between an electro-nuclear qubit and a purely electronic qubit, respectively, referring to the degrees of freedom in which the two qubit states differ, cf. FIG. 3.",

FIG. 3 shows two possible choices for the mapping between passive and active qubits: (a) electro-nuclear qubit and (b) purely electronic qubit. Activation of a qubit is achieved by two \u03c0-pulses as discussed in the main text. Each pulse leaves one hyperfine state of the passive qubit untouched and takes the other state into one of two target hyperfine states within the excited electronic doublet. Those two states constitute the active qubit. The two target states have opposite (electronic) magnetic moments, and thus the active qubits can interact over a long distance.",
                                "To maximize the lifetime of such an active qubit, the excited doublet should be the lowest CF level of an excited J-manifold, whose gap to lower J-manifolds is significantly bigger than the Debye frequency. Under those conditions the active qubit state can only decay via multi-phonon emission or via photon emission. For RE ions the photon emission rate is strongly suppressed, because the electric dipole operator only couples states with opposite parity. Since all 4fn-configurations of RE ions with a fixed number n of electrons in the 4f-shell have the same parity, the matrix elements for the optical decay are either due to small admixtures of highly excited states such as 4fn\u221214g and 4fn\u221215d, or due to electric quadrupole moments. In either case the matrix elements of electromagnetic field operators are very small and accordingly the lifetimes of those doublet states will be long. Depending on the solid-state matrix, the rare-earth ion and the considered J-manifold, this can be more than 15 ms. Finally, the decoherence due to phonon emission is considered, i.e. due to the decay of the upper to the lower active qubit state. The associated rate is small due to the tiny Debye density of states at the frequency of the Zeeman splitting. Lifetimes from 130 ms to 60 s have been reported e.g. in Er-doped Y2SiO5. All the above considerations show that the active qubits should have long coherence times."

The detailed reasons that single out this structure are developed in the next sections where single-qubit and two-qubit gate operations are described. In Sec. \u201cDiVincenzo criteria\u201d it is argued that the DiVincenzo criteria for quantum computing are met, and in Sec. \u201cAddressability of selected qubits\u201d and Sec. \u201cpassive qubit errors\u201d the robustness of the states of qubits not targeted by particular single-and two-qubit operations is demonstrated.",
                        "As explained above, one requires the electronic ground state to be a doublet with a magnetic moment, which one then Zeeman-split to obtain a non-degenerate ground state. This polarized electronic ground state is hyperfine-coupled to the nuclear spin, whose ground state is anti-aligned to the electronic spin. Since the hyperfine splitting of the electronic ground state is much stronger than dipolar interactions involving the nuclear spin, the latter do not mix different states of the passive qubits. It is advantageous to further require that the doublets of electronic ground and excited states come with different g-factor anisotropy. As one will see in the next subsection, this helps to reduce the single-qubit gate time by allowing for an efficient implementation of nuclear spin flips in the ground state by driving optical transitions via the excited doublet states. Ideally, the g-tensors are both strongly anisotropic, but favoring different magnetization directions. To be precise, let us refer to the main rotation axis of the RE point group as the z-axis, or the longitudinal direction. In many point symmetry groups the g-factor is a diagonal tensor with longitudinal and transverse components, g\u2225, g\u22a5. The present scheme requires that the anisotropies, g\u2225, g\u22a5, of the two doublets differ. Ideally they differ a lot, e.g. by having g\u22a5\u00bbg\u2225 in one doublet, but g\u22a5\u00abg\u2225 in the other doublet. By far the best gate fidelities are achieved if the doublet of the active qubit is a pure Ising doublet (g\u22a5=0). Note, however, that vastly different anisotropies are unusual, and that a vanishing perpendicular g-factor requires special symmetries at the RE sites, cf. Sec. \u201cCrystal Symmetry\u201d. Nonetheless, as long as the anisotropies of the ground and excited state doublets differ sufficiently, one can carry out fast single-qubit gates, as discussed in the next subsection. This situation is most easily met in Kramers ions (with an odd number of electrons), since non-Kramers ion doublets do not allow for finite values of g\u22a5, as discussed in Sec. \u201cCrystal Symmetry.",
                        "An external magnetic field splits the electronic doublets. It may be helpful to visualize the situation in an extreme case where the ground state has an easy-plane anisotropy, g\u22a5\u00bbg\u2225, while the excited doublet is of Ising type, having an easy-axis anisotropy, g\u2225\u00bbg\u22a5. If the field has comparable transverse and longitudinal components, the Zeeman-split eigenstates of the ground state doublet are then mostly polarized in-plane, while the excited doublet splits into eigenstates with a predominantly longitudinal magnetization. The nuclear polarizations of the associated hyperfine states follow the same pattern, as they are coupled antiferromagnetically to the magnetic moment of the electrons. One uses the notation |\u2191n, |\u2193n to indicate that the nuclear spin is aligned or anti-aligned with the electronic spin in the excited doublet, respectively, and similarly |+n, |\u2212n for the ground state doublet."

The latter implies that the nuclear spin is not conserved upon driving transitions between the ground and excited electronic states. Therefore, the passive qubit can be manipulated by driving transitions via the lowest hyperfine state in the excited doublet, merely by coupling to the electronic degrees of freedom. For example, an X-gate, i.e. a logical spin-flip, is achieved with three consecutive laser pulses, as sketched in FIG. 4. In this scheme, the gate time is limited by the inverse of the electronic matrix elements, which are typically much larger than the Zeeman coupling to the nuclear moments.",

                        "Let us discuss the present qubit and gate implementations in the light of the DiVincenzo criteria for scalable quantum computing. For a system to qualify as a platform for quantum computing they require:\n\n\n- - 1. A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits: In the\n    present case the well characterized single RE ions serve as qubits\n    as described in the previous sections. Scalability and the\n    addressability of single qubits will be discussed in the next\n    subsection.\n  - 2. Ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple\n    fiducial state: Qubits can be initialized in their ground state, \\|0\n    _(pas), by cooling to a temperature significantly below the gap to\n    the first excited state (the upper state of the passive qubit),\n    which is set by the hyperfine interaction.\n  - 3. Long decoherence times as compared to gate times: One achieve\n    long life and decoherence times by working with long-lived passive\n    memory qubits, which are only transferred into active qubit states\n    right before a multi-qubit operation is carried out, cf. Sec. Active\n    and passive qubits.\n  - 4. A universal set of quantum gates: Single-qubit gates can be\n    implemented efficiently, as described in Sec. Single-qubit gates. To\n    realize a universal set of quantum gates, one needs only one\n    entangling two-qubit gate. One choses to implement the CNOT gate,\n    cf. Sec. CNOT gate implementation. The present implementation is\n    about two orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed\n    implementations based on the dipole blockade.\n  - 5. A qubit-specific measurement capability: In principle, one could\n    measure single RE spins by detecting the emission of a photon after\n    excitation to a high-energy manifold. However, since single-photon\n    measurements have low fidelities, repeated measurements would have\n    to be made; and since the emission process destroys the quantum\n    information, this approach is not viable for our RE qubits. Another\n    way to measure RE spins is suggested: a different RE ion nearby may\n    serve as the readout ion. One then uses the electric (or magnetic)\n    dipole blockade to shift the transition frequencies of the readout\n    ion. If the qubit to be measured is in state \\|0\n    , an external laser excites the readout ion and emission can be\n    detected. The excitation and the emission measurement can be\n    repeated without altering the qubit information (apart from the\n    initial wavefunction collapse which projects onto the eigenstate\n    basis of the qubit), assuming that the excited readout ion decays\n    back to its ground state sufficiently rapidly and that there is no\n    component of its wavefunction that becomes entangled with the qubit\n    ions. Alternatively, we could also perform a CNOT operation\n    analogous to the two-qubit gate, with the qubit as the control bit\n    and the readout ion (in its ground state) as the target bit. This\n    allows for a faster readout than the dipole blockade scheme as\n    discussed below, but it necessitates more control over the readout\n    ion. A further possibility to read out the qubits consists in\n    measuring the RE charge state after an optical excitation. Such\n    single-ion measurements have been demonstrated for example with\n    erbium defects in silicon."

The present scheme implements single-qubit manipulations by resonant electro-magnetic pulses. Those should address one and only one qubit at a time. In general, one will spatially separate the qubits and work with dilute magnetic RE ions, using materials in which most RE sites are occupied by non-magnetic RE ions, e.g. trivalent Yttrium. The dilution ensures that the CF levels are those of an isolated ion surrounded by Yttrium, with qubits further away having a negligible symmetry breaking effect on the CF environment. Despite the spatial separation between the qubits, laser pulses cannot be focused below a fraction of their wavelength (although of course near field optical excitation can defeat this limit for samples with a thin, near-surface layer of rare earth impurities), and thus moderate dilution by non-magnetic ions is insufficient to ensure selective addressability of single qubits.",
                                "Without operating in the near-field limit, the problem can be overcome by altering the gap between the electronic ground state doublet and the excited state doublet of RE ions locally. If the transition frequencies of the RE ions within the range of a focused laser pulse are shifted by sufficiently different amounts, a single qubit can be addressed by selecting both the focal point and the frequency of the laser. Such a spatial modulation of the transition frequencies has the additional benefit of suppressing the interaction-mediated hopping of an activated qubit state to neighboring RE ions, which would otherwise reduce the life-time of activated qubits.",
                                "Addressability by static modulation: If scalability is not an immediate concern, but the aim is merely to selectively address and entangle a few qubits (which is sufficient, e.g., for quantum repeaters), one can achieve a spatially restricted, static modulation of qubit parameters with polarized magnetic adatoms, most easily realized by another species of RE which will be subject to the same (polarizing) external field already imposed on the qubit atoms. Their dipolar magnetic field falls off as \u02dc1/r3. For RE ions within a few nanometers from the adatom, the variation of their Zeeman splitting with the distance to the adatom is strong enough to selectively address a few different qubits within that range.",
                                "Addressability by dynamic modulation: For a quantum computer, it is more convenient to generate the spatial modulation of transition frequencies dynamically, as needed during a protocol. In order to activate one or a few qubits, one alters the transition frequencies of the targeted RE ions only, so that their gaps are temporarily shifted to be in resonance with the applied laser pulse sequence. In contrast to a static implementation of frequency shifts, such an approach is not limited by the number of qubits that one could address selectively. To achieve the local alteration of RE ion transition frequencies, one proposes to apply local electric fields by local gating. An electric field induces a Stark shift in all CF levels that have electric dipole moments. An array of gates similar to a set-up proposed in the art allows tuning of selected RE ions into resonance with a particular laser resonance line, so as to either activate a qubit or perform selective single qubit operations, as sketched in FIG. 7. The difference in the Stark shift between the targeted RE ion and its neighbors determines the required frequency resolution and thus imposes a bound on the minimal single-qubit gate times.",
                                "This dynamic modulation is only possible if the relevant CF states have a non-vanishing electric dipole moment and thus experience a finite Stark shift. As previously mentioned, the present scheme is easiest to implement with Kramers RE ions. Indeed, Kramers doublets have a non-vanishing electric dipole matrix element within their doublet subspace for almost every crystallographic point symmetry group that does not contain the inversion symmetry.",

Below one will use the Stark coefficient of \u03b4\u03bd/\u03b4\u03b5=35 kHz/(V/cm) measured for Eu-doped Y2SiO5 to estimate the order of magnitude of the electrical fields required to achieve a desired fidelity of the present scheme.",

However, the associated increase of the activation time decreases the fidelity of two-qubit gates, which is intrinsically limited by the activation time as 1\u2212CNOT\u2273(tact/tgate)2. One needs to optimize these two competing constraints. The single-qubit gate fidelity is most likely limited by the activation error of the N non-targeted qubits which are affected by an activation pulse with a finite spatial focus. For simplicity one assumes the same Stark detuning for all non-targeted qubits. This reduces the gate error of the non-targeted qubits to N times that of a single qubit. It then follows from Eq. 4 that to achieve a desired single-qubit fidelity act and two-qubit fidelity, the Stark shift between qubits needs to be larger or equal to",

This could be realized, e.g., using liquid phase epitaxy or pulsed laser deposition. Another route is to implant RE ions in silicon, which would allow one to profit from the advanced technology developed for silicon electronics. Single-ion implantation with secondary electron detection for feedback allows the high-fidelity fabrication of 2d-arrays of implanted ions. For methods of RE incorporation with considerable randomness in the positions of the RE atoms, the RE layer in FIG. 7 will need to be surveyed to identify those atoms usable for qubits and quantum gates. Approaches could include superresolution or near field microscopy where one can take advantage of the strong fluorescence of the rare earths. Voltages applied to the gating grids could tune in and tune out the fluorescence response and so locate the RE atoms with respect to the gating grids.",

The last error source that one has to consider is due to interactions between active qubits and nearby passive qubits during two-qubit gates where the targeted RE ions stay activated for an extended period. These interactions can be described in terms of a dipolar field that depends on the active qubit's state and acts on the passive qubits. The field can be decomposed into components parallel and transverse to the existing average local field on the passive qubit. The effect of the longitudinal part cancels out once a spin-echo (within the active qubit) is applied, as is indeed the case for our CNOT scheme. However, the transverse part of the field induces a second order correction to the level splitting, which does not reverse under the spin-echo.

Prior art proposed to use the so-called dipole blockade. Here the qubits consist either of two electronic CF states or of two hyperfine levels of a single electronic level. An auxiliary state to which one qubit state can be excited, is used as well. All these states interact via their magnetic or electronic dipole moments. As discussed in Sec. Active and passive qubits, for RE ions, magnetic and electric dipolar interactions are usually of similar strength, since the electric dipole moments are typically very small, while typical magnetic moments are fairly large.",
                                "The dipole blockade works as follows: If the control qubit is in the |0 state it is transferred to an excited state with different dipole moment. Through its dipolar interaction with the target qubit, the level structure of the latter is changed. Now a sequence of three pulses, whose frequencies match the unmodified level structure of the target qubit, is applied. This swaps the states |0 and |1 of the target qubit, but only if the control qubit was left in the state |1, since the pulse sequence is off-resonant if the control qubit was excited, cf. FIG. 8. After this conditional swap, the control qubit is brought back to its initial state.",
                                "FIG. 8 schematically shows a pulse sequence for the dipole blockade scheme. If the control qubit is in state |0, it is excited, which shifts the levels of the target qubit out of resonance with the swapping pulses. A swap is thus only carried out if the control qubit was in state |1. The indices \u2018ctrl\u2019 and \u2018tar\u2019 denote the control and target qubit, respectively.",
                                "Such a dipole blockade could also be implemented with the present magnetic states, and it is thus interesting to compare it to the proposed scheme. It turns out that the present CNOT implementation is significantly faster because it makes use of the full interaction strength between two RE ions, achieving a gate time equal to tgate=\u210f\u03c0/(4Jdip). The dipole blockade instead relies on the ability to resolve the frequency shift induced by the dipole interaction. This requires Rabi frequencies smaller than the interaction strength and consequently gate times that are substantially longer than in the present scheme. The gate time is determined by minimizing the \u03c0-pulse duration. This is carried out by numerical evaluation of the unitary time-evolution in the rotating-wave approximation and optimizing with respect to both the pulse cut-off Tcut and Gaussian pulse width T, such that for all detunings larger than \u0394\u03c9dip the gate error is below a threshold value 1\u2212F. Like for the present direct gate, the gate time of the dipole blockade is proportional to 1/\u0394\u03c9dip, but in addition, it grows logarithmically with the desired gate fidelity, cf.\\FIG. 9. Therefore, if one requires gate errors to be less than 104, the indirect dipole blockade is roughly a factor of 50 slower than the present gate.",
                                "The result of the optimization in FIG. 9 shows that the minimal gate time required in the dipole blockade increases monotonically with the required fidelity, but does so in an oscillatory manner. This originates from Rabi-like oscillations of the (unwanted) transition probability, which in turn results from the non-adiabatic switching-on and -off of the pulses at t=\u00b1Tcut. Viewing the fidelity as a function of the \u03c0-pulse duration T\u03c0=2 Tcut, the local maxima of the fidelity are spaced by \u0394T\u03c0=4\u03c0\u0394\u03c9dip.",

The speed-up increases logarithmically with the maximally admissible gate error 1\u2212F. The oscillatory behavior traces back to Rabi oscillations in the unwanted transition probability. One assumes the same strength of dipolar coupling in both schemes.",

In contrast to the present scheme, the donors have no electronic spin. Instead they are tunnel-coupled to single-electron transistor structures. By gating those, an extra electron is loaded into a spin-down state onto the donor. This operation is the equivalent of the present gate-tuning the RE qubits by a local Stark shift, which singles out the qubits which are later selectively addressed. In the prior art proposal, resonant microwave pulses then transfer the stored quantum information from the nuclear spins to the electronic states. This is the analog of the activation step of the present e-qubits. Two active qubits interact by dipolar interactions, and the CNOT gate is realized in the same way as discussed herein.",

To improve the gate fidelity, faster single-qubit gates and/or better decoherence times are needed. The former requires more anisotropic g-factors, i.e. different doublets or a different material. To improve the decoherence time, one should decouple the electronic spins from the surrounding nuclear spins sitting on other (non-RE) atoms.

                                "In this document, one has proposed an implementation of qubits using RE ions subject to a crystal field and hyperfine coupling. The present scheme provides a promising platform for universal quantum computing. One uses nearly decoupled passive (memory) qubits and transfer them to less protected active qubits only when they are involved in a two qubit gate. The passive qubits are well-protected nuclear spin states serving as quantum memory. The active qubit states are magnetized electronic states that can interact over relatively long distances.",
                                "The level scheme of a single ion (illustrated in FIG. 2) has the following essential ingredients:\n\n\n- - (i) a Zeeman-split magnetic ground state;\n  - (ii) a nuclear spin and strong hyperfine interactions;\n  - (iii) a doublet state at the bottom of an excited J-manifold, having\n    a magnetic anisotropy differing from that of the ground state. The\n    last requirement is easiest to meet with Kramers RE ions. The\n    highest two-qubit gate fidelities are achieved by excited doublet\n    states with g\u22a5=0. Using a crystal where the RE site has one of the\n    point group symmetries highlighted in Table I allows for electrical\n    gating of the qubits and thereby assures that individual qubits can\n    be addressed selectively. As a concrete example and illustration of\n    the inventive scheme, one has discussed the case of Er-doped LiYF\u2084.\n    The scheme proposed here equally applies to molecular magnets and\n    crystals hosting transition metal ions, as long as they generate a\n    CF level structure that matches the above three criteria. Given the\n    possibilities offered by isotope enrichment and semiconductor\n    processing, one believes the most promising materials platform to be\n    silicon doped with RE ions.",
                                "Using the above ingredients, it is possible to implement a CNOT gate using the Ising-like dipole interaction between two active qubits. This achieves a speed-up by up to two orders of magnitude as compared to the standard dipole blockade.",
                                "A decisive advantage of the inventive scheme as compared to many others lies in the fact that the selective activation and the slow power law decay of the dipole interaction allows gates between relatively distant qubits, even if many non-activated qubits are located between the two qubits that are being coupled. In contrast to similar schemes which also use nuclear spins as passive qubits, one can reach a speed-up for single-qubit gates by a factor of order 600. This is achieved by coupling to electronic instead of nuclear matrix elements which is possible due to different g-factors in the ground state and the excited doublets. Furthermore, the use of the effective spin of a RE shell (as opposed to spins of single electrons as in phosphorous doped silicon) allows for larger magnetic moments of several \u03bcB. At equal distances of qubits, the dipolar interaction is enhanced by the square of the larger magnetic moment and the two-qubit gate time is accordingly reduced by an order of magnitude. Thus, the present invention discloses the implementation of RE qubits with coupled electro-nuclear degrees of freedom and fast single-qubit and CNOT gates that can entangle not only nearest neighbors, but also relatively distant qubits in an array. Combined with the readout capability of single ions and the possibility of coupling RE ions to optical modes, networks of such ions are appropriate for scalable quantum computing."
