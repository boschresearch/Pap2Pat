    "abstract": "The present systems and methods provide a mechanism to assess viewer behavior, features of stimuli, and the interaction between viewer behavior and stimuli. The systems and methods described herein for quantifying blink response and blink inhibition provide moment-by-moments measurements of viewer engagement by measuring what is or is not engaging enough to warrant viewers' inhibition of blinking. The present disclosure describes measures of visual scanning, eye movements, blink data, and blink timing data to derive a measure of how engaged a person is with what he or she is looking at. Blink-related data as a measure of viewer engagement provides a mechanism for determining the most engaging spatial and temporal aspects of a stimulus.",

                        "When we blink, the flow of visual information between the world and one's retina is temporarily interrupted. In that instant of blinking, visual stimulation from the external world is lost for 150-400 milliseconds (ms or msecs). As a result, the average adult in the course of a single waking day will spend approximately 44 minutes with his or her eyelids closed missing visual information. During those moments, a variety of neural systems encompassing movement of the oculomotor muscles, activity in supplementary and frontal eye fields, and widespread activity in visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortical areas work together to suppress the actual visual signal of an occluding eyelid. These systems create the illusion of perceptual continuity, but if new visual information is presented in that instant of blinking, it will be missed.",
                        "During the collection of eye movement data, eye-blinks have been traditionally regarded as noise or artifact data and are generally deemed useless. However, blinking also relates to cognitive states beyond mere physiological function. It is also generally known that individuals remain largely unaware of their blinking, although blinking may be generally related to both explicit and implicit attentional pauses in task content.",
                        "Identification and quantification of a person's engagement with a visual stimulus can provide insights for many different fields. In cognitive and behavioral testing, as for autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental disabilities, and other cognitive conditions, measuring how engaged a viewer is with specific types of visual (or audible) content can provide a biomarker of disease/disorder state, disease/disorder progression, and/or treatment response. For instance, children with developmental disabilities, which affect 1 in 10 within the general population, show delayed acquisition of speech and language skills. A measure of a child's engagement with speech and language cues (e.g., level of engagement with talking faces or communication gestures, which are precursors to language acquisition) can aid in the diagnostic identification of a child with developmental disabilities at a much earlier age than diagnosis of such disabilities conventionally occurs.",
                        "In another example, in commercial industries, one of the main concerns for many marketing companies is measuring the effectiveness of various marketing campaigns. Traditional approaches to determining visual marketing campaign effectiveness include conducting consumer surveys and questionnaires, analyzing sales numbers, social media \u201cbuzz\u201d, etc. However, marketing companies would benefit from having a mechanism to determine directly from viewer behavior, without secondhand reporting or surveys, the effectiveness of a visual marketing campaign by measuring the level of a viewer's or group of viewers' engagement to that marketing campaign during test trials prior to releasing the campaign or during the actual campaign. In another example, developers of visual teaching aids may also benefit from having a measure of student engagement levels during the development phase of the teaching aids. Other industries could benefit from measuring indicators of engagement to visual stimuli, such as video game developers, flying and driving simulator developers, etc.",
                        "Therefore, there is a long-felt but otherwise unresolved need for a system and method that can assess and measure viewer engagement. Moreover, there is a need to measure engagement with certain visual and/or auditory stimuli, such as movies, television shows, marketing campaigns, print ads, web pages, emergency videos, teaching aids, even physical environments and objects, etc. in order to enable optimization thereof. Further, there is an additional need for a system and method to use measures of viewer engagement as biomarkers for assessing disease/disorder state, disease/disorder progression, and/or treatment response in conditions such as autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others that effect engagement with circumscribed content."

                        "Briefly described, and according to one embodiment, aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for assessing blink inhibition and blink response as indicators of engagement with visual stimuli. In particular, aspects of the present disclosure relate to utilizing the timing of blink inhibition during natural viewing and in response to visual stimuli to accomplish the following: to assess viewer engagement with stimuli, to assess viewer perception of the relative salience of stimuli, to assess a stimulus's power to engage specific viewers or groups of viewers, to identify the most engaging spatial and temporal features of a stimulus, and to categorize or rate viewers as a function of their engagement with a given stimulus for demographic or diagnostic purposes. According to one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a tool for assessing viewer engagement on the basis of blink rate and the timing of blinking and blink inhibition, during natural viewing. In one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a tool for quantifying viewers' moment-by-moment engagement with visual content and the degree to which viewer engagement varies dynamically. In another embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a tool for quantifying listener's moment-by-moment engagement with auditory content and the degree to which listener engagement varies dramatically as it relates to blink inhibition and blink data.",
                        "Further, and according to one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a mechanism for determining, by a \u201cdata mining\u201d approach, the most engaging spatial and temporal features of a stimulus on the basis of time-varying viewer engagement. Further aspects of the present disclosure relate to the way in which these measures of engagement can be combined with eye-tracking point-of-gaze data to measure the specific parts of a stimulus that a viewer is fixating upon at moments of greater or lesser engagement (e.g., fixation locations).",
                        "Further aspects of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for assessing disease/disorder state (e.g., presence/absence of a condition), disease/disorder state progression, and/or treatment response in conditions for example but not limited to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and others that effect engagement with circumscribed content or engagement. In one embodiment, in research leading to the present disclosure, toddlers with ASD, unlike typically developing comparison children, demonstrate markedly delayed blink inhibition in relation to specific visual events. The present systems and methods indicate that typical toddlers, relative to the same visual events, inhibit their blinking earlier than toddlers with ASD. This difference provides evidence of intact cognitive processes in typical toddlers and evidence that those processes are disrupted in toddlers with ASD: typical toddlers inhibited their blinking in active anticipation of the unfolding of salient social events, while toddlers with ASD did not. These measurements provide information that can be used for assessing diagnostic status as well as for measuring severity of symptomatology. Related embodiments can be deployed to measure the level of engagement of, for example, recovering drug addicts with environmental triggers (for example, images of alcohol, drugs, or locations in which such substances are typically procured or consumed) in order to assess risk for relapse.",

In particular, aspects of the present disclosure relate to utilizing the timing of blink inhibition during natural viewing and in response to visual stimuli to: to assess viewer engagement with stimuli, to assess viewer perception of the relative salience of stimuli, to assess a stimulus's power to engage specific viewers or groups of viewers, to identify the most engaging spatial and temporal features of a stimulus, and to categorize or rate viewers as a function of their engagement with a given stimulus for demographic or diagnostic purposes. According to one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a tool for assessing viewer engagement on the basis of blink rate and the timing of blinking and blink inhibition, during natural viewing. In one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a tool for quantifying viewers' moment-by-moment engagement with visual content and the degree to which viewer engagement varies dynamically.",

Further aspects of the present disclosure relate to the way in which these measures of engagement can be combined with eye-tracking point-of-gaze data to measure the specific parts of a stimulus that a viewer is fixating upon at moments of greater or lesser engagement (e.g., fixation locations).",

In one embodiment, in research leading to the present disclosure, toddlers with ASD, unlike typically developing comparison children, demonstrate markedly delayed blink inhibition in relation to specific visual events. The present systems and methods indicate that typical toddlers, relative to the same visual events, inhibit their blinking earlier than toddlers with ASD. This difference provides evidence of intact cognitive processes in typical toddlers and evidence that those processes are disrupted in toddlers with ASD: typical toddlers inhibited their blinking in active anticipation of the unfolding of salient social events, while toddlers with ASD did not. These measurements provide information that can be used for assessing diagnostic status as well as for measuring severity of symptomatology. Related embodiments can be deployed to measure the level of engagement of, for example, recovering drug addicts with environmental triggers (for example, images of alcohol, drugs, or locations in which such substances are typically procured or consumed) in order to assess risk for relapse."

The experiment(s) utilize the timing of blink inhibition of toddlers during natural viewing of a stimulus to assess various aspects in connection with levels of engagement. Details of the experiment(s) conducted along with associated data/parameters, exemplary settings, the associated results from the experiment(s), general implications, and alternate embodiments will be better understood in the description and accompanying figures provided in greater detail below.",

Additional examples of blink data may comprise blink rate before, during, and after a task, wherein the blink rate is measured and analyzed for variations at a plurality of intervals throughout the viewing of a visual stimulus; in particular, before, during, and after viewing the visual stimulus. Blink data may also comprise measurements of instantaneous blink rate as it relates to intratask blink inhibition. Further, it will be understood that blink data are generally used to assess various levels of blink inhibition, timing of blink inhibition, viewer engagement with stimuli, viewer perception of relative salience of stimuli, a stimuli's capability to engage a viewer, etc. In another aspect, blink data may relate to the measurement of the timing and/or presence/number of eye-blinks during the listening of an auditory stimulus. Similar to the various mechanisms relating to a visual stimulus, the same measures may apply while listening to an auditory stimulus.",
                                "Also referred to herein, stimulus events in this example, without limitation to other possible embodiments thereof, generally comprise three groups: nonaffective/nonphysical events, physical events, and affective events. Affective events generally comprise events within the visual stimulus having an effect on emotional behavior, such as facial expressions and/or vocalizations eliciting heightened emotional affect. Physical events typically relate to events wherein a discrete object within the visual stimulus is moving, shifting locations, changing states, etc. Any other portion of the visual stimulus that is not categorized as an affective or physical event is categorized as nonaffective/nonphysical events. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the use of the terms affective, physical, nonaffective and nonphysical events are merely used in the exemplary discussion below and are not intended to limit the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.",

Further, various other experimental methodologies utilized in the present disclosure are similar to those used in prior patents and published papers by some of the same inventors of the present application, and are described in at least the following patents that are hereby incorporated by reference; in particular: U.S. Pat.

                                "The aforementioned references generally relate to systems and methods for mapping and analyzing visual salience (the measure of a given viewer's visual attention as it relates to or stands out against another's visual attention) as a viewer or group of viewers visually engage with a visual stimulus. In particular, the references generally describe various methods for recording, analyzing, and displaying visual salience for an individual or a distributed group of individuals or providing a mechanism to compare an individual's or selected group of individual visual responses to a known set of visual responses. In certain embodiments, a monitoring device (or eye tracker) is generally used in conjunction with the visual stimulus to measure the physical location at which a person is looking. Further, the earlier disclosures describe methods for coordinating visual salience data to a specific instance in time of the visual stimulus. This provides diagnostic information according to what a control or typical individual's data suggest in comparison with a test individual, group of test individuals, or known data.",
                                "Still referring to the earlier patents incorporated herein by reference, in one embodiment, each viewer's set of data may be graphed on an x, y, and z-axis coordinate system, wherein the x and y dimensions generally represent an area on the visual stimulus or point of regard with which a viewer engages (e.g., spatial fixation locations towards which a viewer's gaze is directed). Further, the z-axis generally corresponds to time and may be time-locked (or time-correlated or synchronized) with the visual stimulus. Accordingly, multiple sets of data or lines can be mapped onto the same plot to generate a set of data or scan path, whether it is a control group (the group whose data is known and used as the standard) or the group/individual being tested. Generally, at least two trends emerge when analyzing the visual salience data: (1) the test data (points) are loosely distributed and form a large radius (circle) if the points were connected in a circular manner, and (2) the test data or points are closely clustered together forming a tight grouping and a small radius (circle) if the points are connected in a circular manner. In the first instance, wherein the large circle is formed, this is generally called a divergent set meaning the data points are random and tend to spread away from each other. The second instance, wherein the small circle is formed, is typically called a convergent set meaning the data points have a tendency to plot closely and gravitate towards each other.",
                                "Further, the earlier patents referenced above further describe divergent data sets as a particular instance in time or a particular frame where the majority of individuals engage different areas on the screen. Conversely and according to another embodiment, a convergent set describes a scenario where most individuals engage the visual stimulus in one area (x, y-axis) on the screen during a particular frame or instance in time. Further, the individual data sets or lines are connected radially and linearly to form a varying three-dimensional shape that resembles a collection of cones or beehives horizontally connected together (also referred to herein as an attentional funnel). The wider parts of the cone represent divergent data sets and the closer segments of the cone represent convergent data sets. These three-dimensional collections of data points are used to analyze and compare various test individuals or test groups. In the scenario in which a test individual does not have visual salience data points in convergent sets, the data point is flagged and noted. If there is a pattern of data points existing outside of the convergent sets, there is an increased probability the testing individual is not engaging with the stimulus according to the control data. Further details of the aforementioned references will be described in greater detail in connection with FIGS. 1B-1D.",
                                "Now referring to the specific experiment(s) and test data described herein, test methodologies comprised the utilization of ninety-three children with a mean (M) chronological age of 2.3 years (SD=0.55) participating in the experiment(s) disclosed herein. The visual stimulus comprised a video the children watched that included an unscripted interaction between a boy and a girl playing together in a toy wagon (as representatively shown in FIG. 3). None of the participants had previously viewed the video. Further, in unscripted scenes of natural interaction, the video included various physical and affective events. For example, a physical event shown in the video comprised a door of the wagon opening and closing. Similarly, an affective event shown in the video comprised an argument between the boy and the girl. Although, the physical and affective events were not mutually exclusive, the locations of the greatest affect were spatially discrete from those of most movement, with affectively charged facial expressions separated from the physical location of the door.",
                                "The distinction between affective and physical events was relevant to the experimental design because the children who watched the video were divided into two groups that were expected to vary in their response to affective and physical cues. The video was shown to 41 two-year-olds with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as well as 52 typical two-year-olds. Here, the children with ASD provide a preferred comparison group because the children have been shown previously to display atypical patterns of visual attention to social interaction, attenuated reactivity to varying social affect, and lack of differential response to social attentional cues, but also intact response to physical attentional cues and intact ability to predict and attend to physical events. In the present experimental paradigm, blink inhibition was tested as a marker of perceived stimulus salience, varying by group membership.",
                                "FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary blink and/or eye monitoring system 100 for quantifying and mapping visual salience and for quantifying visual engagement over time as utilized in one test methodology. The system 100 shown in FIG. 1 is a representation of the system used to test the individuals in the experiment(s) described herein. The system includes at least one processor 102. Processor 102 may be any type of device designed to receive and execute software programs, or that which is designed to be modified in functionality by software programs. For example, the processor 102 may be selected from a group comprising digital signal processors, microcontrollers, and microprocessors, or a group consisting of field programmable gate arrays, and computer programmable logic devices.

Each eye tracker 110 may be any device for tracking the blink response of at least one eye of an individual (e.g., individual human or any other species/animal). In one embodiment, the eye tracker 110 may be an infrared video-oculography eye-tracking device. In another embodiment, the eye tracker 110 is a binocular eye tracker. In another embodiment, the eye tracker may comprise a blink monitoring system for identifying blinks performed by a subject. In such an embodiment, the processor will receive blink data 112 indicative of the subject's blink responses to a visual stimulus 120. In yet another embodiment, the eye tracker 110 may comprise a combination of an eye-tracking device and a blink monitoring device, wherein the eye tracker 110 is capable of detecting eye data and blink data. According to another aspect, each eye tracker 110 may generate eye data 112 indicative of eye movement responses such as eye movements, direction, dilation, rotation, gaze, blinking, etc. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, eye data may include blink data for exemplary purposes and is not intended to limit the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.",

Various aspects of the exemplary data collection and assessment process were utilized a plurality of times with the various test participants described herein. In one embodiment, the first parameter examined utilizing the process illustrated in FIG. 2 and commencing the present experiment(s) was overall blink rate and blink duration to test for physiological differences in eye-blink behavior between toddlers with ASD and typical toddlers. Eye movement data was recorded at the rate of 60 Hz, and blinks were recorded as events with a measurable duration, identified by an automated algorithm, supplemented and verified by simultaneous video recording in all participants (as described in step 204 of FIG. 2), and separately verified by simultaneous electromyography recordings in one adult viewer.",

The computer monitor was mounted within a wall panel, and the audio soundtrack was played through a set of concealed speakers. Toddlers were seated and buckled into a car seat mounted on a pneumatic lift so that viewing height (line-of-sight) was standardized for all children. Viewers' eyes were 30 in (76.2 cm) from the computer monitor, which subtended approximately a 23\u00b0\u00d730\u00b0 portion of each child's visual field. Lights in the room were dimmed so that only images displayed on the computer monitor could be easily seen. A five-point calibration scheme was used, presenting spinning and/or flashing points of light as well as cartoon animations, ranging in size from 0.5\u00b0 to 1.5\u00b0 of visual angle, all with accompanying sounds. The calibration routine was followed by verification of calibration in which more animations were presented at five on-screen locations. Throughout the remainder of the testing session, animated targets (as used in the calibration process) were shown between experimental videos to measure drift in data. In this way, accuracy of the eye-tracking and eye blink data 112 was verified before beginning experimental trials and was then repeatedly checked between video segments as the testing continued. In the case that drift exceeded 3\u00b0, data collection was stopped and the child was recalibrated before further videos were presented. All aspects of the experimental protocol were performed by personnel blinded to the diagnostic status of the children. Most aspects of data acquisition and all aspects of coding, processing, and data summary are automated, such that separation between the diagnostic characterization protocol and the experimental protocol was assured.",

The video was presented in full-screen mode with an accompanying audio soundtrack on a 20-in (50.8 cm) computer monitor 140 (refresh rate of 60 Hz non-interlaced), according to step 202 in FIG. 2. Video frames were eight-bit color images, 640\u00d7480 pixels in resolution. The video frame rate of presentation was 30 frames per second. The audio soundtrack was a single (mono) channel sampled at 44.1 kHz. The original audio soundtrack contained an instance of adult narrator voiceover; this was removed digitally to make the video scene as naturalistic as possible. The duration of the video was 1 min and 13.6 s. Individual measures of blink rate and blink duration (see FIGS. 3 and 4) were measured during video watching, as opposed to during intertrial intervals.",

The eye-tracking technology was video-based, using a dark pupil/corneal reflection technique with eye movement data collected at the rate of 60 Hz. Analysis of eye movements and coding of fixation data were performed with proprietary software written in MATLAB (MathWorks). The first phase of analysis was an automated identification of nonfixation data, comprising blinks, saccades, and fixations directed away from the stimuli presentation screen (see step 204 of FIG. 2).

As will be understood and appreciated, other methods could be used to detect blinks, such as eyelid closure, certain eyelid movement, and the like. The blink detection algorithm was supplemented by simultaneous video re-cording in all participants and verified by manual coding of the video data in 10% of participants' data. The algorithm was also verified by simultaneous video and electromyography (EMG) recording in one adult viewer. In comparison with video recordings, the algorithm accurately detected 95.0% of all blinks identified by manual coding of video images. In comparison with EMG recordings, the algorithm accurately detected 96.4% of blinks recorded by EMG. Events identified by the algorithm as blinks but shorter than 166.7 ms or longer than 566.7 ms were excluded from analysis in accordance with previous studies of blink duration and in agreement with visual inspection of the video images (blinks in FIG. 7, which appear longer than 566.7 ms, are actually multiple blinks separated by brief fixations, obscured by the plot resolution). Duration measurements comparing blinks detected by the algorithm and blinks detected by EMG were different by less than 10 ms (i.e., less than the sampling detection threshold of the eye-tracker). Saccades were identified by eye velocity using a velocity threshold of 30\u00b0 per second. Off-screen fixations, when a participant looked away from the video screen, were identified by fixation coordinates to locations beyond the screen bounds. Throughout all viewing data, the proportion of nonfixation data (saccades+blinks+off-screen fixations) was not significantly different between the ASD (M=24.25%, SE=1.2) and typical (M=24.7%, SE=1.5) groups [t(91)=0.22, P=0.82] (see step 204 of FIG. 2).",

The ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of trial type (Wald X2=18.70, df=2, P<0.001). Post hoc comparisons indicated that mean bpm pre- and post-trial were not significantly different from one another (Wald X2=0.64, df=1, P=0.42), but that blink rate during each of those conditions was significantly greater than blink rate during the experimental trial (Wald X2=20.58, df=1, P<0.001 and Wald X2=14.57, df=1, P<0.001, respectively).

This difference was tested between observed blink rates and permuted data for each group by two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, finding significant differences for each (D=0.22, P<0.001 for typical toddlers and D=0.28, P<0.001 for toddlers with ASD).",
                                "As part of the correlation of blink inhibition to the visual stimulus 120, a plurality of segments of the visual stimulus was identified as affective content and physical content (also referred to herein as affective events and physical events). Ten adults rated the affective content of the video scene in a two-stage process. First, the entire video was divided into 15 segments, and viewers were asked to rank the segments from most affective to least affective. Interrater coefficient of concordance for these rankings was highly significant (Kendall's W=0.879, X2=123.02, df=14, P<0.0001). The eight segments ranked most highly were then used to identify precise timing of the affective events. To do so, adult raters examined each of the eight most affective segments frame-by-frame and selected the time point at which the affective event began and the time point at which the affective event ended. The SE of start and end times across all raters was 152 ms. Start and end times for each affective segment were averaged across the 10 raters, resulting in eight affective events. Physical events were defined as all-time points in which a wagon door was moving (with start and end points set by the start and stop of the door's motion). As will be generally understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, events do not necessarily have to be categorized as affective or physical events, and such categorizations are merely used as exemplary purposes for the present experiment(s) and disclosure. Furthermore, a plurality of mechanisms may be utilized for determining and measuring changes in blink rate in relation to any kind of event.",
                                "Having confirmed that blinking was inhibited at levels greater than expected by chance and inhibited at specific times during unconstrained viewing of natural scenes, it was tested whether blink inhibition varied selectively with respect to video content, visual fixation, and viewer group. As described above, the experimental paradigm presented two categories of content (affective and physical events) to two populations of children known for differential attention to those categories (children with ASD and typical toddlers). In the video shown to participants, the boy in the video desires to leave the wagon door open, whereas the girl wants it to be closed; this scenario conveniently created varying levels of affective content (the discord between the boy and the girl) and a repeated physical action (the closing or opening of the wagon door).",
                                "To operationalize the designation of affective and physical events in a video of unscripted natural interaction, 10 adult viewers rated the level of affect throughout the entire video, identifying eight segments within the video in which facial expressions and/or vocalizations showed heightened emotional affect (e.g., time periods when the boy or the girl in the video became visibly angry). The coefficient of concordance for interrater affective ranking was highly significant (Kendall's W=0.879, X2=1223.02, df=14, P<0.00001). Physical events were operationalized as times when the wagon door was moving. The two event types were not mutually exclusive but, per the independent raters, overlapped less than 25.18% of the time.",
                                "The remaining segments of the video were classified as nonaffective/nonphysical events. It was predicted that viewers would inhibit their blinking during moments perceived to be particularly important to process and would increase their blinking during moments perceived to be less important. To examine how the timing of blink inhibition varied with respect to affective and physical events, peristimulus (or \u201cperievent\u201d) time histograms (PSTHs) were used. PSTHs were constructed by aligning segments of individual time series blink data to the onset of events and by then computing counts of an individual's blinks occurring in 33.3 ms bins in a surrounding 2,000 ms window (as shown in step 208 in FIG. 2). Bin counts were computed for each participant across all events and then averaged across all participants to obtain group means.",
                                "To test whether the observed changes in blink rate differed from those expected by chance, a second set of PSTHs from permuted blink data was computed. As before, individual blink sequences were permuted by circular shifting of individual data 1,000 times. PSTHs were then computed on each of those permuted datasets. The mean instantaneous blink rate, during each bin, across all 1,000 PSTHs from permuted data quantified the blink rate one would observe if blink rate were random with respect to onscreen events. If, on the other hand, blink rate were time-locked to onscreen events and not random, one would expect to see significant deviations from the permuted data distribution. The 5th and 95th percentiles of instantaneous blink rate across all PSTHs from permuted data served as a P=0.05 confidence level against which to compare blink rates in the actual data (one-tailed comparisons). To test for between-group differences, confidence intervals (CIs) of bootstrapped data for each group were computed, as noted in step 216 of FIG. 2.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 8A and described in step 218 of FIG. 2, the PSTH for typical toddlers reveals a 32.4% reduction in blink rate for affective events, reaching its minimum 66 ms prior to the zero lag. This indicates statistically significant blink inhibition in typical toddlers (P<0.05), time-locked to the occurrence of events with high affective valence. Toddlers with ASD also show a reduction in blink rate (35.8%), but that reduction is greatest 599 ms after the zero lag of affective events (see FIG. 8G).",
                                "The between-group difference in timing is highly significant, because the CIs of bootstrapped lag data for each group are nonoverlapping (see FIG. 8M, lag time for blink rate minimum in typical toddlers: CI5=\u2212230 ms, CI95=0 ms; lag time for blink rate minimum in toddlers with ASD: CI5=33 ms, CI95=700 ms). The observed difference in timing was not attributable to a more general delay in speed or frequency of eye movements, because it was found that no between-group differences in latency to shift gaze [typical toddler: M=1.09 s (SE=0.20), toddlers with ASD: M=0.96 s (SE=0.28); t(91)=0.40, P=0.69, measured as reaction time to initiate a first saccade following the onset of the movie] or in duration or frequency of fixations [duration for typical toddlers: M=442 ms (SE=16.4), duration for toddlers with ASD: M=492 (SE=29.4); t(91)=\u22121.57, P=0.12 and frequency for typical toddlers: M=2.04 fixations per second (SE=0.09), frequency for toddlers with ASD: M=1.93 (SE=0.11); t(91)=0.85, P=040].",
                                "Each group shows a numerical, although not statistically significant, reduction in blink rate by event type (see FIG. 8N): Typical toddlers exhibit greater reduction in blink rate during affective than physical events (32.4% vs. 25.4%, FIGS. 8A and 8B), whereas toddlers with ASD exhibit the reverse pattern, with a 41.7% reduction for physical events and a 35.8% reduction for affective events (see FIGS. 8G and 8H). Both groups of toddlers show a significant increase in blink rate relative to nonaffective nonphysical events (see FIGS. 8C and 8I). Helping to disambiguate the question of differential engagement is the pattern of each group's visual fixations during the two event types (see FIG. 8O). Typical toddlers spent significantly less time looking at objects than toddlers with ASD during both event types [F1,91=12.01, P=0.001, repeated measures ANOVA with diagnosis (2 levels)\u00d7event (affective vs. physical)], and the interaction between diagnosis and event type was significant (see FIG. 8O) (F1,91=5.99, P=0.016). Paired-samples t tests confirmed that typical toddlers showed no difference in percentage of fixation on objects during affective vs. physical events (t1,51=0.85, P=0.4; Maffective=25.5%, SD=14.21 vs. Mphysical=26.5%, SD=16.7), but that toddlers with ASD increased fixation on objects, such as the moving wagon door, during physical events (see FIG. 8O) [M (SD)=33.9(16.7) for affective vs. 40.0(17.2) for physical; t1,40=3.57, P=0.001].",
                                "In sum, blink inhibition for typical toddlers was (i) most reduced just prior to the zero lag of events, (ii) numerically greater for affective rather than physical events, and (iii) unrelated to level of fixation on objects (marked instead by greater than 73% fixation on people during both event types). In contrast, for toddlers with ASD, blink inhibition was (i) most reduced after the zero lag of events, (ii) numerically greater for physical rather than affective events, and (iii) marked by a significant increase in fixation on objects during physical events (see step 220 of FIG. 2).",

In one embodiment, viewer group A and viewer group B do not exhibit blink inhibition while viewing event A. According to one aspect and as illustrated in FIG. 6C, as both viewer groups engage with event A, neither group inhibited their blink rate as both groups' bpm remained between approximately 9 and 13 blinks per minute.",

Alternatively, viewer group A's blink inhibition is not modulated and generally hovers around 9-13 blinks per minute. In one aspect, this demonstrates that viewer group B's level of engagement notably increases during engagement with event B; whereas viewer group A's level of engagement generally does not change.",

Blink inhibition remains relatively close for both viewer groups around 9-13 blinks per minute. The discussion example of FIG. 6C demonstrates various levels of engagement amongst groups of people in response to certain events (e.g., events within a given stimulus, or between different stimuli entirely, etc.). For example, a marketing firm may use such an assessment in determining a marketing campaign's power to engage a target demographic. Accordingly, if a marketing campaign is intended to target a demographic of 30-40-year-old women, specifically during predetermined segments of a visual stimulus, viewer group A may comprise 30-40-year-old men and viewer group B may comprise 30-40-year-old women. If event B comprises the predetermined segment designed to captivate individuals belonging to viewer group B, then in this exemplary description the marketing campaign may be successful at increasing the level of engagement (assessed by measuring blink rate and blink inhibition) for viewer group B during event B. As will be generally understood, the aforementioned description is for exemplary purposes and is not intended to limit the spirit or scope of the present disclosure.",

PSTHs show the percent change in bpm relative to the mean of permuted blink data. Dashed horizontal lines mark 0.05 and 0.95 CIs; the percent change in bpm beyond these levels represents a change in bpm greater than expected by chance (one-tailed, P<0.05).

The exemplary determination of viewer engagement activity process utilizes similar mechanisms as described in connection with FIG. 2. For example, the process generally initiates by displaying a visual stimulus to a viewer (see step 1002). As previously described, a visual stimulus may comprise a plurality of forms of media including: a DVD, stored digital media, a video game, etc. Subsequently, a processor 102 receives and records blink data (see step 1004) corresponding to a viewer while simultaneously receiving stimulus data 122 that corresponds to the visual stimulus. Blink data is generally captured via an eye tracker or eye-monitoring device 110 before propagating to the processor. The processor typically comprises software enabling the blink data to be transformed to a usable, assessable format as executed in process 1006.",

As previously discussed, time-locking blink data with stimulus data 122 enables assessment of blink behavior and blink inhibition relative to various indicators within the visual stimulus. In some instances, the process of determining viewer engagement activity may involve gathering data for one or a plurality of viewers, wherein generally for assessing a plurality of viewers the aforementioned steps 1002-1010 are repeated until the desired group of viewers is attained. Furthermore, viewers may be categorized into various demographics according to the intent and spirit of the target experiment(s) (step 1012). For example, an illegal-substance screening stimulus may be created, wherein a viewer is tested for their level of engagement as he or she views various illegal substances to potentially categorize as a user or ex-user of illegal substances.",

In one embodiment, the aggregated time-locked blink data is generally assessed for a plurality of indicators including: determining an individual's instantaneous blink rate, the probability of whether an individual blinked or will blink, etc. Generally, these indicators are synchronized with one or multiple points in time with respect to the visual stimulus 120. Utilizing the aggregated and parsed blink data, the results are assessed to identify various patterns of blink inhibition (see step 1016) and compared with predetermined indicators within the stimulus data and other predetermined factors (see step 1018). Subsequently, a general assessment can be made regarding the viewer(s) level of engagement as it relates to various events within the visual stimulus (see step 1020). For example, when engaging a viewer regarding an illegal substance screening, a drug user may vary his or her level of engagement or blink timing when shown an illegal substance versus someone who does not use illegal substances.",

Further in certain embodiments (described in greater detail below), in addition to comparing the level of engagement at particular points in time, a comparison is made to locations of visual fixation according to various times within the visual stimulus. The comparison can be used for identifying areas of convergence and divergence within the data sets such that an assessment may be generated to determine if the viewer's blink data exists within/outside of the limits of the predetermined ranges of acceptable data (see step 1112). Subsequently, a further assessment can be made (see step 1114) as to the disease/disorder state of the viewer utilizing the comparison of the control data and the viewer's blink inhibition data.

                                "In one embodiment illustrated in FIG. 13, a process 1300 is illustrated for identifying the most engaging temporal and spatial features within a stimulus. Similarly to the process described in FIG. 12, a stimulus may be displayed to one or more viewers(step 1302), eye-movement and blink data may be recorded (steps 1304 and 1305) and converted to an assessable format (step 1306), and the eye-movement and blink data can be time synchronized to the visual stimulus (step 1308). Further, the time-locked eye and blink data may be permuted to quantify the probability of blink response during the viewing of the visual stimulus for participating viewers (see step 1312). As previously described, permuting blink data enables an accurate analysis of blink response; hence, enabling periods of blink inhibition to be identified for a given viewer or group of viewers (see step 1314).",
                                "Through the aforementioned process of quantifying visual salience, the eye-movement data is assessed to determine areas of fixation and correlated with periods of blink inhibition to identify the most engaging temporal and spatial features of a visual stimulus (see steps 1316 and 1318). In particular, if it is assumed a viewer is engaged with a video exhibiting blink inhibition, then identifying location of fixation data may indicate spatial and temporal locations of the video that are most engaging. Through a \u201cdata-mining\u201d process executing numerous trials to collect a plurality of data, assessing the level of viewer engagement to a visual stimulus, and specifically to various features within the stimulus, can help assess the most engaging temporal and spatial features of the stimulus based on time-varying viewer engagement.",
                                "FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary process 1400 of assessing patient condition state, according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. Similarly to the process described in connection with FIG. 11, blink data is recorded (step 1404), converted to assessable format (step 1406), and compared to time-stamped events to identify various blink patterns (step 1410). A further assessment regarding the level of blink patterns relative to predetermined ranges is conducted to identify severity, mildness, or change of condition state (see step 1412). For example, a viewer may be previously diagnosed with a cognitive condition and is routinely assessed to monitor the state of that cognitive condition. Further, the predetermined data that the newly acquired blink data is compared to may comprise previous data from the viewer at an earlier stage of his or her diagnosed condition. According to the measure of condition severity, longitudinal data may be collected to determine the measure of change in the state of the present condition (see step 1416).",
                                "**Further Analysis**",
                                "According to some embodiments of the present disclosure (in particular, the experiment(s)s described above), patterns of blink inhibition and the distribution of visual fixations map onto well established between-group differences, but also reveal more subtle differences in the subjective assessment of stimulus salience. For example, according to one aspect, when data were time-aligned to scenes of heightened affective content (FIG. 6A), typical toddlers showed a persistent inhibition of blinking that peaked before the zero event lag. Toddlers with ASD, in contrast, exhibited a peak in blink inhibition that occurred more than 0.5 s after the zero event lag.",
                                "That typical toddlers inhibit their blinking earlier than toddlers with ASD shows the unexpected possibility that typical toddlers are actively anticipating the unfolding of salient events, and are doing so in time-locked fashion. The visual fixation data tell a similar story: Toddlers with ASD look more at physical objects in the video scene and selectively increase their fixation on those objects when the objects move (that is, during the designated physical events). Accordingly, utilizing time-locked blink inhibition and/or visual fixation data can be used in assisting diagnosis of various cognitive disorders or degradations.",
                                "In contrast, typical toddlers' attention to socially relevant cues, such as eye-gaze, facial expression, and body posture, may allow them to anticipate actions that have not yet happened but may be about to happen (as when angry facial expressions precede a yell or the slamming of the wagon door). These cues help typical toddlers generate expectations about how actions in the world will subsequently unfold. For toddlers with ASD, however, blink inhibition, as an after-the-fact reaction, can be seen as reflecting a lack of sensitivity to those environmental (and, in particular, social) cues. It suggests an engagement with affective and physical stimuli separate from the social context in which they are typically perceived: although typical toddlers may be engaged by the slamming of the car door because of its relevance to the ongoing social interaction between the characters, engagement by toddlers with ASD may be in reaction to the salient physical properties of such events.",
                                "These hypotheses regarding between-group differences in how movie events were perceived underscore the point that even though movie events may be classified as affective or physical, it is unlikely that they were perceived as mutually exclusive dualities. One of the main goals of the experiment(s) was to test for blink inhibition using semi-structured, naturalistic stimuli. In such situations, categorical boundaries of affective and physical become blurred: typical toddlers, for instance, are likely to perceive the social significance and affective meaning behind the slamming wagon door. This blurring of affective and physical categories may account for why reductions in blink rate trended in the expected directions but did not reach statistical significance in this particular analysis, with typical toddlers showing a larger reduction in response to affective events, whereas toddlers with ASD showed greater reduction to physical events. Further, events do not necessarily have to be categorized into either affective or physical events to determine a level of engagement, as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.",
                                "The results demonstrate that patterns of blink inhibition can provide an inroad into an aspect of social affective experience that has been lacking in the field of autism research and in many neuroethological studies of visual perception in general: a measure of not only what someone is looking at but of how engaged he or she is with what he or she is looking at. Although previous work has shown that children with ASD allocate fewer attentional resources to socially relevant stimuli than their typically developing peers, these studies have failed to capture how engaged children are with what they are fixating on.",
                                "Further, measures of blink inhibition are well suited to providing temporally precise indices of perceived stimulus salience during naturalistic, fast-paced presentations of visual content. In comparison to other autonomic responses traditionally used in psychophysiological studies, such as electrodermal and cardiovascular activity, blink inhibition compares well for measuring reactivity to emotional stimuli: electrodermal and cardiovascular responses are highly multi-determined, preventing strong inferences about their relationship to mental activity; in addition, their latency and refractory periods undermine precise temporal markings of their measurements relative to affective or cognitive state. Blink inhibition, in contrast, is intrinsic to the visual system rather than a peripheral function; its on- and off-set parameters are precise and temporally sensitive to ecologically valid, fast-paced presentations of content; and, finally, blink inhibition can be measured by entirely noninvasive, even concealed, eye-tracking cameras, or other devices, circumventing the need for obtrusive equipment that would alter the ethological validity of other measures.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present systems and methods provide a mechanism to assess viewer behavior, features of stimuli, and the interaction between viewer behavior and stimuli. Specifically and according to one aspect, because blinking interrupts the flow of visual information to a viewer, and because the inhibition of blinking ensures that the flow of visual information will not be disrupted, measurements of the precise timing of when individuals do or do not inhibit their blinking can provide robust quantitative indices of viewer engagement and the subjective assessment of perceived stimulus salience, even though individuals are largely unaware of their own blinking during everyday situations. Therefore, the systems and methods described herein for quantifying blink response and blink inhibition provide moment-by-moments measurements of viewer engagement by measuring what is or is not engaging enough to warrant viewers' inhibition of blinking.",
                                "One embodiment of the present disclosure describes measures of visual scanning, eye movements, blink data, and blink timing data to derive a measure of how engaged a person is with what he or she is looking at. In one aspect, blink related data as a measure of viewer engagement provides a mechanism for determining the most engaging spatial and temporal aspects of a stimulus. According to another aspect, measures of blink inhibition provide a promising index of autonomic reactivity and differential engagement, time-locked to salient moments within fast-paced, rapidly changing visual displays. By precisely measuring the timing of blink inhibition relative to unfolding content, one can determine, on a moment-by-moment basis, a viewer's subjective assessment of the importance of what he or she is watching.",
