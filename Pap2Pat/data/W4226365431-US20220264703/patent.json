For example, localized heating may be used in neuroscience to activate thermal-sensitive ion channels, in hyperthermia treatment of cancer to disrupt cancer cells' ability to repair DNA damage, in expedited wound healing, in temperature-controlled drug release, and in bioanalytical techniques including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and temperature gradient focusing (TGF). Controlled localized heating can avoid overheating and permanent damage to adjacent healthy tissues.",
                        "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) can absorb energy from alternating magnetic fields and subsequently dissipate heat to immediate surroundings, generating a localized heat sufficient for bio applications. Conventional magnetic thermal applicators face challenges including low heating efficiency and limited spatial resolution. Generally, in conventional devices, heating efficiency is low because the magnetic loss is proportional to frequency. As such, high field strength is needed at KHz-MHz to generate sufficient heat, requiring power-consuming benchtop magnetic field generators. Additionally, spatial resolution is limited because it is difficult to control the local magnetic field distribution with sub-millimeter spatial resolution using KHz-MHz coils, which usually range from 40-130 mm in diameter."

                        "One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an integrated microheater array device for efficient and localized heating of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) at microwave frequencies. The integrated microheater array device of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure has high heating efficiency and high spatial resolution.",

Each pixel may include a population of MNP, a stacked oscillator, and an electro-thermal feedback loop. MNP may have different nanostructures and compositions and thus, present different ferromagnetic resonance frequencies. MNP are capable of generating localized heat induced by an alternating magnetic field programmed by the stacked oscillator. The electro-thermal feedback loop monitors the localized heating and provides feedback to the stacked oscillator to configure an output power of the stacked oscillator and to regulate the local temperature distribution.",
                        "One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to method of localized heating by an integrated microheater array device with a stacked oscillator circuit topology. The integrated microheater array device can generate localized and programmable (in terms of frequency and amplitude) magnetic field at microwave frequencies, such as from 0.3 GHz to 300 GHz, through the proposed stacked oscillator circuit, and in turn, drive the magnetic nanoparticles to deliver localized heat at greater than 43\u00b0 C., very efficiently. The achieved spatial resolution of the heating profile is 0.6 mm\u00d70.7 mm, approaching a single-cell resolution.",
                        "While the integrated microheater array device achieves sub-millimeter resolution horizontally (in the XY plane), the penetration depth (in the Z direction) may range to about \u02dc100 \u03bcm. One way to increase the penetration depth may include lowering the operating frequency to tens/hundreds of Megahertz, which may increase the penetration depth to millimeter- and centimeter-level.",
                        "Conventional oscillators on a silicon chip can generally only achieve a maximum voltage swing of <6 Vpp at microwave frequencies. In contrast, the proposed stacked oscillator of the present device, accordingly to one or more embodiments, demonstrates a 20-26 Vpp voltage swing, which is \u02dc4\u00d7 higher than conventional designs. As the magnetic field strength is proportional to the square of the voltage swing, the presently disclosed stacked oscillator can lead to \u02dc16\u00d7 magnetic field strength enhancement. The circuit topology can also be scaled to achieve an even higher voltage swing on silicon chips.",
                        "In addition, in one or more embodiments, the local temperature may be monitored by on-device temperature sensors. The sensor output may be used to control the magnetic field strength and the local heat generation in real-time through an electro-thermal feedback loop, resulting in a closed-loop operation to realize the desired temperature with a high precision and a high energy efficiency automatically. The presently described device is an integrated magnetic thermal applicator with sub-millimeter spatial resolution that may be widely applicable in, but not limited to, non-invasive biomedical heating applications.",
                        "The integrated microheater array device disclosed herein may be used for a wide range of applications, especially for power-constrained scenarios, e.g., battery-powered devices. For example, the device may be used in magnetogenetics with minimally invasive brain stimulation, where temperature-sensitive ion channels in the brain can be thermally activated using localized heating induced by MNP. A high spatial resolution (i.e., approaching a single-cell resolution) allows fine manipulation of the local temperature distribution and may potentially control the spike firing of individual neurons. Besides, for in-vitro cell-based neural stimulation experiments, the high heating resolution is advantageous in directing the neural signal propagation in a neural network.",
                        "The integrated microheater array device disclosed herein may be used for dose-controlled drug delivery, where drug molecules are loaded in a core/shell structure with the shell coated by MNP. Because of the high heating resolution, a number of shells to be heated up to release the drug molecules inside the core/shell structure is controllable, thus the dose and time of administration of the drug are controllable.",
                        "The integrated microheater array device disclosed herein may be used for skin cancer hyperthermia therapy. The localized heating may trigger apoptosis and disrupt cancer cells' ability to repair DNA damage. The technology will be useful to design heat patches for non-invasive skin cancer treatment. Due to its high spatial resolution, the patch can generate heat only in the tumor region without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues.",
                        "The method disclosed herein may include applying and/or disposing MNP in a position proximal to a chip having one or more pixels comprising a stacked oscillator and an electro-thermal feedback loop, and subsequently generating an alternating magnetic field with tunable intensity and frequency controlled by the stacked oscillator. The method may further include monitoring the localized heating, and providing feedback to configure and tune an output power of the stacked oscillator.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, a plurality of pixels of the microheater array 100 may be arranged in an array configuration with m columns and n rows, as shown in FIG. 1. Each pixel may be presented by their column and row numbers from (1,1) to (n,m). Each pixel 101 includes an inductor 102, a stacked oscillator 103, and an electro-thermal feedback loop 106. In one or more embodiments, the stacked oscillator may comprise an oscillator core 104 having a plurality of transistors, and one or more capacitor bank 105. Stacked oscillator 103 may use capacitor bank 105 to tune an oscillation frequency while tolerating a high RF output voltage swing. While FIG. 1 shows two capacitor banks, the present stacked oscillator may have one or more capacitor banks. In one or more embodiments, each stacked oscillator may have one differential capacitor bank, where a top plate and a bottom plate of the capacitor is connected to a positive output and a negative output, respectively. In one or more embodiments, each stacked oscillator may have two single-ended capacitor banks, whose bottom plate is grounded.",
                        "Though one inductor configuration is shown in FIG. 1, it is noted that the configuration including size and shape of the inductor is not limited to this example. An inner radius (Rin) of the inductor is defined as a distance from a center of the inductor to a furthermost point of the innermost turn of the inductor. In one or more embodiments, the inner radius (Rin) of the inductor modeled may be at micrometer scale, for example, from about 30 \u03bcm to about 300 or from about 30 \u03bcm to about 200 or from 30 \u03bcm to about 100 \u03bcm. A shape of the inductor may be symmetric or non-symmetric. In one or more embodiments, the inductor may have a coil (or spiral) geometry, for example, a single coil or intertwined multiple coils with underpasses. In one or more embodiments, the inductor may have a shape of square, hexagon, octagon, circular, or any other shape of interest. In one or more embodiments, the inductor may have one or more number of turns. The inductor may have one or more turns, for example, 1-turn, or 2-turn, or 3-turn, or 4-turn, or 5-turn, or 6-turn, or 7 and more turns.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, a stacked oscillator has a topology as show in FIG. 2, where the stacked oscillator includes capacitor bank 205 and has an oscillator core shown in detail, in which multiple transistors are connected in series (M1-MN) to distribute a voltage stress and, in turn, to achieve a large RF output swing using a single inductor footprint. The transistors are stacked, and a biasing voltage (Vb), a gate capacitor (C), and a biasing resistor between Vb and C are applied to each transistor. Both a drain-to-source voltage (Vds) and a drain-to-gate voltage (Vag) for transistors are close to one another and within a breakdown limit. In other words, values of Vds1, Vds2, to VdsN are close to one another and values of Vdg1, Vdg2, to VdgN are close to one another. Unlike cascode topology where gates of upper common-gate transistors are ac grounded, additional gate capacitors (C2-CN) are introduced to form a capacitive divider with a gate-to-source parasitic capacitance (Cgs), rendering a RF voltage swing at the gate. A goal of such design is to gradually build up the voltage swing at drain terminals from M1 to MN and to ensure the Vds of each transistor is close to one another and smaller than the device breakdown limit. Different from stacked amplifiers, the stacked oscillator involves a positive feedback loop to sustain oscillation. This is accomplished by connecting the oscillator output to a gate of M1 after voltage attenuation by a capacitor C1 to keep a biasing voltage (VGS) of M1 in safe operating region. A tail transistor is used to adjust an oscillation amplitude, whose biasing voltage (Vtail) is controlled by electro-thermal feedback. A supply voltage (VDD) of the stacked oscillator may depend on a number of transistors.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, a capacitor bank has the topology shown in FIG. 3. Though a 4-bit switched capacitor bank is shown in FIG. 3, it is noted that the number of bits is not limited to this embodiment. Each capacitor bank may have a plurality of bits (parallel binary-weighted branches). Referring again to FIG. 3, the 4-bit switched capacitor bank includes four switches with a capacitance scaling ratio of 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively. Turning off all switches lead to a fixed capacitance of Cfix. Adjusting the capacitance of the capacitor bank, by turning on or off switches SW1 to SW4, leads to change of the resonance frequency of the stacked oscillator. Turning on all switches result in an overall capacitance of (1+2+4+8) times of unit capacitance Cunit plus the fixed capacitance Cfix. For SW1, a transistor width/transistor length is 40.32 \u03bcm/112 nm. For SW2 to SW4, the transistor width/transistor lengths are multiplied by the scaling ratio. There exists a trade-off between a frequency tuning range and a quality factor of the capacitor bank. A larger transistor size for switches reduces an on resistance, which increases the quality factor; however, a larger transistor size results in a larger off capacitance, which compromises the frequency tuning range. To alleviate this trade-off, the frequency tuning range may be divided into sub-ranges (for example, 1.2-1.6 GHz, 1.5-2.1 GHz, and 2.0-2.62 GHz), and the stacked oscillators in different rows of array may be assigned with different sub-ranges. In addition, capacitances Cunit and Cfix and sizes of the switches may be optimized, such that the output RF swing remains almost constant over the entire frequency range.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the electro-thermal feedback loop within each pixel has a circuit scheme as shown in FIG. 4. The electro-thermal feedback loop functions as a temperature sensing and control path to sense a local temperature and generate a biasing voltage for a tail transistor of the stacked oscillator for a closed-loop temperature control. The temperature sensing and control path 400 may include a Proportional-To-Absolute-Temperature (PTAT) temperature sensor array 401. Four diode pairs may be placed at four corners of the inductor and below a ground plane, which are relatively away from an oscillator core of the stacked oscillator to avoid sensing ohmic loss generated by the transistors. The diode pairs 402 are routed to the inductor, for example, a top-layer of floating metals in a center of the inductor, to sense a surface temperature.",
                        "Still referring to FIG. 4, in one or more embodiments, the electro-thermal feedback loop may include a 4-to-1 multiplexer (4-1 MUX) 1203. Followed by the 4-1 MUX, a PTAT output is further amplified and buffered to regulate the biasing voltage Vtail of the tail transistor of the stacked oscillator. A 1st gain stage 1204 and a 2nd gain stage 405 may be used to ensure a large loop gain and their reference voltages are generated by two separate 7-bit coarse-fine resistor-string digital-to-analog converters (DACs). A reference voltage of the 1st gain stage Vref1 is set to guarantee the PTAT output is linearly amplified, and a reference voltage of the 2nd gain stage Vref2 is determined by a targeted temperature through a lookup table (LUT). A low impedance at Vtail is highly desired, especially outside a bandwidth of unity-gain buffer, to filter out coupling from a strong oscillation swing. In one or more embodiments, a 1 pF capacitator may be added to Vtail, which also introduces a pole to the temperature sensing and control path. All the electrical poles may be designed and verified to be higher than 100 kHz. Thus, the electro-thermal feedback loop behaves as a first-order system without stability concerns.",
                        "Still referring to FIG. 4, in one or more embodiments, the electro-thermal feedback loop may be configured in multiple modes, for example, in three modes using a plurality of switches OL and CL 406. In a close-loop mode (OL=0 and CL=1), the PTAT array and the gain stages are enabled and buffer to the tail transistors. An input/output (IO) pad monitors response in real-time. Temperature configuration is enabled in a closed-loop mode. When the target temperature is set to a value, the localize temperature increases and settles in a short time after turning on the temperature sensing and control path. When the target temperature setting changes, the temperature sensing and control path provides feedback to configure the dc output power, and the temperature settles accordingly based on the targeted temperature setting. In an open-loop mode (OL=1 and CL=0), the PTAT and the gain stages are turned off, and the oscillator is controlled by an external biasing Vtail of 0-1.1 V through the IO pad. In an off mode (OL=0 and CL=0), the stacked oscillator is turned off by a pull-down transistor, and the entire temperature sensing and control path is also turned off.",
                        "An example of the integrated microheater array system according to one or more embodiments is shown in FIG. 5. Integrated microheater array device 500 includes a MNP layer 511 containing a population of MNPs 512, a microheater array 513 having a plurality of pixels, a metal layer 514, a substrate 515, and bonding wires 516. The MNP layer may be in liquid phase (for example, a solution) or solid phase (for example, a membrane). The MNPs are capable of generating localized heat when induced by an alternating magnetic field programmably controlled by the stacked oscillator. The metal layer may comprise copper trace. The bonding wires, which comprise a metal such as gold or aluminum, connects the microheater array to the metal layer on the substrate. The electro-thermal feedback loop monitors the localized heating and provides feedback to the stacked oscillator to configure an output power of the stacked oscillator and to regulate the local temperature distribution. The MNP layer may be disposed directly on the microheater array.",
                        "In one or more embodiments, the substrate may comprise one or more of silicon, polysilicon, silicon oxide, metal, and metal oxide.

The microheater array may be fabricated on the substrate by any known electronics fabrication method in the art, for example, photolithography, chemical processing, and may comprise one or more processes such as deposition, coating, patterning, etching, ionization, and packaging. In one or more embodiments, the fabrication of the integrated microheater array device may utilize silicon on insulator (SOI) technology, or more specifically a SOI complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.",
                        "The MNPs are a class of microscopic magnetic nanomaterial with a diameter at nanometer scale, whose magnetic properties are distinct from those of bulk magnetic materials. The MNPs according to one or more embodiments may have different sizes, materials, nanostructures, and compositions and thus, present different ferromagnetic resonance frequencies. The MNPs may comprise one or more of iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, manganese, or rare-earth element. The MNPs may be an oxide of aforementioned elements. In one or more embodiments, the MNPs may include a modification layer with various biologically functional compounds for biocompatibility, such as fatty acid, lipid, PEG, enabling diverse biomedical applications. The MNPs may be prepared by any known method in the art. The MNPs may be suspended in the MNP layer, in forms of a fluid with suspended MNPs or a membrane with embedded MNPs. In one or more embodiments, the MNP layer may be an aqueous solution of MNPs or a membrane of MNPs embedded in a polymer. The polymer may be a biocompatible polymer known in the art, such as polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, polyacrylic acid, polydimethylsiloxane, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide).",
                        "FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B show the mechanism of MNP heating, where FIG. 6A shows an illustration of the imaginary part of the permeability of MNP over frequency and FIG. 6B shows magnetic moments of different heating mechanisms. The low-frequency (kHz-MHz) peaks are attributed to Neel and Brownian relaxations, whereas the ferromagnetic resonance usually happens around GHz microwave frequencies. At a length scale below a critical point, the MNPs can support only a single magnetic domain, behaving as a macro magnetic moment. For example, such transition occurs at about 80 nm in diameter for MNPs made of magnetite (Fe3O4). Due to the magnetic anisotropy, there exist two energetically favorable directions for the magnetic moment, which are antiparallel to each other and separated by an energy barrier. When an external magnetic field is applied, heat can be generated by rotating the magnetic moment against the energy barrier. If the magnetic moment rotates while the particle itself remains fixed, then the particle undergoes Neel relaxation, and thermal energy is dissipated by the rearrangement of atomic dipole moments within the crystal. If the nanoparticle itself performs mechanical rotation, then the particle undergoes Brownian relaxation, and the heat is generated through shear stress in the surrounding fluid. On the other hand, ferromagnetic resonance happens when a frequency of the external magnetic field is equal to the precession frequency of the magnetic moment (Larmor frequency). Power of the external magnetic field is then absorbed by the MNP to sustain the precession and dissipated as heat.",
                        "Conventional MNP-based heaters are mostly based on Brownian or Neel relaxation at KHz to MHz. However, for applications requiring highly localized heating at cellular level (e.g., magnetogenetics), conventional MNP-based thermal devices are limited by low efficiency and limited spatial resolution. The reasons for the low efficiency may include: magnetic loss is proportional to frequency; and high field strength is required to generate sufficient heat, requiring power-consuming benchtop magnetic field generators. Furthermore, spatial resolution is limited because it is difficult to control the local magnetic field distribution using bulky coils (40-130 mm in diameter) at KHz to MHz.",
                        "One or more embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an integrated microheater array device based on ferromagnetic resonance of MNP, for example at gigahertz (GHz), with high heating efficiency and high spatial resolution.

With regard to ohmic heating, which is prevalent in microheater design, one major disadvantage is that it tends to involve direct contact between heating elements and targeted bio-samples. For dielectric heating, it is suitable for samples whose dielectric properties are drastically different from the surrounding environment. However, in applications such as biomedical, permittivity difference between targeted cells/tissues and the surrounding environment is insignificant due to a high water content, resulting in poor specificity. For magnetic heating, it is usually accomplished by incorporating magnetic materials such as magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Since most bio-samples are non-magnetic, magnetic heating can support superior specificity than other modalities. When using NMPs for heat generation, there are generally three frequency-dependent heating mechanisms, namely Neel relaxation, Brownian relaxation, and ferromagnetic resonance. The heat loss of all three mechanisms can be modeled using the imaginary part of the permeability \u03bc\u2033 (or the imaginary part of the susceptibility \u03c7\u2033).",

To the contrary, without the presence of MNP, the temperature stays lower than 40\u00b0 C., which typically does not affect the viability of cells and tissues if the duration of the thermal stress is short. Note that 43\u00b0 C. is the threshold temperature in a wide range of bioapplications, for example to activate TRPV1 channels in magnetogenetics. Further raising the temperature over a long time may introduce safety concerns. The simulation also demonstrates that a smaller Rin leads to higher spatial resolution and more uniform heat distribution, and an optimal Rin of the oscillator inductors is 51 \u03bcm compared to larger or smaller radii. While a smaller Rin may involve an excessive dc current to sustain oscillation, which may compromise the oscillator loop gain and startup condition, increasing the Rin results in a non-uniform temperature distribution above the inductor.

As the magnetic loss is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength, a large RF swing is the key to increase the local temperature rise. In order to achieve a temperature of at least 43\u00b0 C. for bioapplications, the multiphysics simulations determine a RF swing at GHz. Unfortunately, the maximum achievable output swing of conventional cross-coupled LC oscillators is twice of supply voltage, which is usually <5 V for RF CMOS technologies, which may be insufficient to generate the desired magnetic field. One possible solution to boost the RF swing is to amplify the oscillator output using RF amplifiers. However, additional inductors are needed in the design of RF amplifiers to serve as resonating tank or impedance matching network, which sacrifices a spatial resolution of the microheater array since the pixel size is dominated by the inductor footprint at GHz. Besides, RF amplifiers are power hungry at GHz, introducing significant dc power overhead. Thus, the present disclosure introduces a stacked oscillator topology and eliminates the need of RF amplifiers and achieves a compact pixel size as well as low dc power consumption.",

The optimization simulation starts with picking up an arbitrarily sized transistor, which is referred to as a unity transistor (1\u00d7), and extracting its layout parasitics to ensure accurate device modeling at GHz (1001). Theoretically, a peak dc-to-RF efficiency is achieved when load impedance is chosen in a way that the output voltage swing and a device current swing are simultaneously maximized. For each VGS within a certain range from minVGS to maxVGS, since the optimal load impedance is biasing dependent, an optimal RL for different VGS is determined based on large-signal load-pull simulations (1002). Rather than utilizing an impedance transformation network to realize the desired RL, it is provided in the present invention that RL is an effective parallel resistance of the inductor. As such, once RL is determined, an optimal LD can be calculated based on equation (8), and a desired Cex to sustain the oscillation at desired frequency can be calculated based on equation (9) (1003). Next, gate capacitances C1-CN are chosen to make sure all transistors are within the breakdown limit (1004). Meanwhile, it is determined whether a robust startup condition can be realized based on the small-signal loop gain (1005). If it is determined that a robust startup condition cannot be realized, the value is discarded. This process is repeated by sweeping VGS (1006). Once an optimal VGS is determined, the transistor size is scaled by a factor of Lopt/LD (1007), as the optimal inductor geometry and its corresponding inductance Lopt have been decided based on the multiphysics simulations.",

Since a VGS smaller than 0.4 V can no longer guarantee robust oscillation startup across process and temperature variations and the efficiency remains similar for a VGS smaller than 0.5 V, 0.5 V is chosen as an optimal design point. The optimization yields a final implementation of a four-stacked oscillator with 200 \u03bcm/112 nm transistor size and a five-stacked oscillator with 248 \u03bcm/112 nm transistor size, resulting in a 45% simulated dc-to-RF efficiency and a loop gain of at least 2.3 across the entire frequency range FR1 to FR3.",

Measured VPTAT, which is a temperature sensor output amplified by the 1st gain stage, against an ambient temperature is shown in FIG. 20A. A response slope was 27 mV/\u00b0 C. from 24 to 48\u00b0 C., presenting a good linearity and alignment with simulation. Measured VIO, which is an output of the 2nd gain stage, against the ambient temperature is shown in FIG. 20B. The measured temperature-to-Vtail conversion gain was \u2212220 mV/\u00b0 C. An operating temperature range of the electro-thermal feedback loop can be fine-tuned by adjusting the DAC setting of Vref2.",

                                "Two PDMS membranes mixed with and without MNPs were used to validate the localized heating performance of the microheater array. The PDMS membranes were fabricated as follows. A sacrificial layer using a photoresist (AZ5209) were spin coated to a substrate (wafer) after a substrate pre-treatment. Next, the PDMS (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer, Dow Corning Corporation) was mixed with MNPs (amorphous Fe3O4) at a MNP concentration of 3.25 wt %. The MNP-PDMS mixture was thoroughly stirred for 20 minutes followed by sonication in a sonic bath at 35\u00b0 C. for an hour. Then the MNP-PDMS mixture was spin-coated on the sacrificial layer and cured at 125\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes. Afterward, the wafer was soaked in an acetone solution for 2 minutes, and the MNP-PDMS membrane floats on the solution surface after the sacrificial layer was dissolved. A thickness of the membrane was estimated to be 36 \u03bcm based on the speed and duration parameters used in the spin coating. Finally, the membrane was cut into small pieces and attached on top of the microheater array.",
                                "The temperature distribution on the membrane surface was monitored using an IR camera (Infratec VarioCAM\u00ae HD 900) with a pixel size of 26 \u03bcm\u00d726 \u03bcm and real-time displayed on a computer. In an open-loop demonstration as shown in FIG. 21, Vtail was biased off-chip through VIO. Three stacked oscillators in the second column were used to measure the local temperature rise in three different frequency ranges FR1 to FR3. For PDMS membrane mixed with MNPs, the local temperature was between 41.93 and 47.05\u00b0 C., as shown in circles. On the other hand, for PDMS membrane without MNP, the local temperature stayed below 37.8\u00b0 C. under the same biasing condition, as shown in triangles. A temperature difference \u0394T with and without the MNPs reached 6.0\u00b0 C. in FR3 and 9.4\u00b0 C. in FR1. The measured temperature distributions at 1.45 GHz on the PDMS membrane surfaces with and without MNPs are shown in FIGS. 22A and 22B, respectively. Only the area above the inductors (about 0.03 mm2) in pixel (2,2) was efficiently heated up for the PDMS membrane with MNPs, demonstrating a sub-millimeter spatial resolution. A slight temperature raise was also observed for the PDMS membrane without MNPs, but the highest temperature is <40\u00b0 C.",
                                "In a closed-loop demonstration, DAC setting of Vref2 was programmed based on the targeted temperature. Vtail was automatically generated through the electro-thermal feedback loop. FIG. 23 shows a settled temperature Tsettled against a desired temperature Tdesired. Tsettled was an average IR camera reading over 5 minutes at 1 frame/s frame rate. Extra calibration steps, e.g., correlating camera reading with PTAT voltage and comparing the camera reading of the PCB with a known ambient temperature, were performed to guarantee an accuracy of the temperature measurement. For example, the temperature reached 45.6\u00b0 C. when the targeted temperature was set to 45.8\u00b0 C. The maximum and RMS temperature errors were 0.53\u00b0 C. and 0.29\u00b0 C. from 37 to 49\u00b0 C. The dc power was smaller than 0.36 W per pixel. A smaller temperature error can be potentially achieved by increasing the number of bits of the DAC.",
                                "The spatial resolution of the integrated microheater array device is determined by monitoring the temperature of two adjacent pixels. When two adjacent pixels were turned on, a sub-millimeter spatial resolution was achieved. FIG. 24 shows two adjacent pixels in a row (top figures) or in a column (bottom figures) that were enabled simultaneously, verifying a sub-millimeter spatial resolution of the local temperature profile. Only the area above the inductors (about 0.03 mm2) within each pixel was efficiently heated up. Good magnetic isolation is the key to minimize the mutual coupling between adjacent pixels, which was achieved by employing an on-chip ground plane between inductors.",

The cancer cells were only ablated when MNPs present and when the microheater pixel is turned on. On the other hand, the cancer cells stayed alive in all other conditions.
