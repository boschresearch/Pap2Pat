                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Cone and cone-rod dystrophies (CORD) are genetically heterogeneous with described dominant, recessive, and X-linked inheritance patterns. To date, at least ten loci for autosomal dominant cone and cone-rod dystrophies have been identified: AIPL1, CRX, GUCA1A, GUCY2D, PITPNM3, PROM1, PRPH2, RIMS, SEMA4A, and UNC119.",
                        "Mutations in the GUCY2D gene coding for photoreceptor specific guanylate cyclase type1 (called ROS-GC1, retGC1 or GC-E in the literature, and herein identified as \u201cGUCY2D protein or polypeptide\u201d), were found in recessive forms, for patients suffering from LCA1 (Leber Congenital Amaurosis form 1), and in dominant negative forms, for patients suffering from a particular form of cone-rod dystrophy called CORD6.",
                        "Typical phenotypic characteristic of CORD6 is first deterioration of cone photoreceptors and then of rod photoreceptors. At the early stage of the disease, there is a decrease of visual acuity, a loss of color recognition and a photophobia. Electrophysiological examination shows significant loss of photopic function (cone function) without changes in scotopic function (rod function). These symptoms are the result of the dysfunction of cone photoreceptors and appear usually within the first decade of life. During the second and third decades of life, rod photoreceptor cells start to degenerate also. In addition to a severely deteriorated color vision (achromatopsia), patients develop dramatic decrease in visual acuity, night blindness and loss of peripheral vision. At the beginning of the fourth decade of life all the earlier observed symptoms are greatly increased and the electroretinogram (ERG) becomes unrecordable.",
                        "As mentioned above, GUCY2D mutations in a human being induce two distinct types of retinal disease depending on the inheritance pattern: Leber's Congenital. Amaurosis 1 for autosomal recessive mutation and CORD6 for autosomal dominant inheritance. A model of genotype/protein structure relation, appearing on FIG. 8, explains the respective consequences of these distinct mutations.",
                        "Animal models are crucial for the genetic dissection of human hereditary disease and the development of efficient treatments.",
                        "Natural animal models are already known for Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and for other retinal affections in mouse, rat, cat, chicken and dog.",
                        "Dogs have an area centralis that contains, in opposition to the human's one, a low proportion of cones, making it quite different from the human fovea.",
                        "Birds retina is mainly composed of cones. The development of birds retina is very different from human retina.",
                        "Mouse transgenic models of retinal diseases (Knockout (KO) mouse, Knockin (KI) mouse, mouse overexpressing a dominant negative allele), and to a lower extent rat transgenic models of retinal diseases, are known in the art. Although murine genetic models have allowed progress in the understanding of degenerative mechanisms, they do retain some major limits for the clinical evaluation of therapeutic strategies (Elizabeth Rakoczy et al., 2006).",
                        "Murines have eye and retinal anatomies which significantly differ from the human's. In particular the size of the eye is much smaller. At the retinal level, the mouse neuroretina is composed mainly of rod photoreceptors, with scattered cones barely representing 3 to 5% of the total photoreceptor population. The mouse retina can thus almost be assimilated to the human peripheral retina. In general, macular or cone degeneration is characterised by the loss of high resolution vision and by a distortion or lack of the vision at the centre of the visual field, progressing to a peripheral degeneration. In human beings in particular, macular or cone degeneration leads to difficulties in reading, impairment of face recognition, and further leads to a decrease in autonomy. To the opposite, Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) and glaucoma are characterised by a preferential impairment of the peripheral retina in which the visual field shrinks progressively and reach \u201ctunnel\u201d vision. The mouse allows obtaining models of diseases affecting preferentially the peripheral retina (in other words affecting rods preferentially but not cones), and often displays phenotypes more pronounced than those observed in humans. As the murine retina does not have macula or a cone-rich area centralis, it is recognized as an inappropriate model of macular degenerations and cone-affecting diseases (Marmorstein and Marmorstein, 2007).",
                        "Therapeutic approaches tested or screened in rodents eye may be very unpredictive of what could be observed in a human being. This can be explained by discrepancies due to the difference of surgical procedures, eye size, eye pressure, immune or inflammatory responses, diffusion within the eye or drug clearance of administered compounds. It can also result from differences in the anatomy of the retina of rodents and human, in particular from differences in the distribution of cones within the retina (the human eye having a fovea containing almost exclusively cones, whereas the cones is mice are scattered within rod cells).",
                        "Adequate animal models of dominant inheritance CORD6 have not been produced until now. Only null mutants of the GUCY2D gene in mice (KO mice) or chicken (null mutant chick) constituting models of Leber Congenital Amaurosis 1 (LCA1) have been described.",
                        "The guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1) KO mouse (Coleman J E et al., 2004) is a mammalian model of Leber congenital amaurosis 1 (LCA1).",
                        "The chicken model, also a model of LCA1, carries a deletion rearrangement in the gene encoding retGC1 that produces a null allele (Semple-Rowland S L et al., 1998).",
                        "Inventors now herein provide a transgenic pig as a model for studying a cone affecting disease, in particular cone and cone-rod dystrophies, comprising a recombinant nucleic acid, encoding a dominant negative human guanylate-cyclase-2D (GUCY2D) protein or polypeptide, which is preferably stably integrated in the pig genome and which is preferably expressed in cones.",
                        "Inventors herein demonstrate that pig, which has an area centralis which is similar in many ways to the human fovea, is particularly suited to generate an animal model of cone affecting diseases mimicking human pathologies."

                        "The use of a pig as herein described as a model system for the prevention and/or treatment of a cone affecting disease typically comprises the development and evaluation of a therapeutic strategy of a cone affecting disease. Different treatment regimens can be evaluated with regard to efficacy and safety, in a continuous manner (over the lifetime or over certain period of time during the life of a transgenic pig) or in time intervals. The time intervals are preferably six-monthly, three-monthly, monthly, two weeks intervals or even weekly intervals. The skilled artisan is able to choose further suitable time intervals.",

                        "The transgenic pigs of the invention are, as explained previously, highly suitable models or model systems for a cone affecting disease, because they exhibit the previously described key features of cone as well as cone-rod-dystrophy. The transgenic pig model furthermore overcomes the previously described limitations of existing models, in particular of mouse models. For the first time, a transgenic large animal model with impaired GUCY2D function is established. This model exhibits genetic, physiologic and biochemical functions, in particular immunologic, endocrine as well as metabolic functions, more similar to those of a human being than the corresponding functions of other animal models. Also, in the respect of eating habits, pigs are omnivorous with a gastrointestinal tract resembling the human being's.",
                        "There are anatomical similarities between the human and the porcine eye, macroscopic as well as histological, making, as herein demonstrated, this animal a good model for testing ophthalmologic treatment modalities and surgical procedures. The porcine eye is in particular similar to the human eye in terms of size. The dimensions of a human eye are of about 24.0\u00d723.5\u00d724 mm (width\u00d7height\u00d7depth) while an eye of a pig weighing approximately 30 kg, has dimensions of about 23.0\u00d721.0\u00d719 mm (width\u00d7height\u00d7depth) (Kiilgaard 2002). Thus, the similarity in size makes it possible to use equipment and surgical devices developed for human purposes in the porcine eye. It also facilitates the possible transfer of new surgical techniques developed and practiced in the porcine eye to the human eye.",
                        "Histologically, the porcine retina further consists of the same ten retinal layers as the human retina. Bruch's membrane and the choroid are also similar. Both pigs and humans have a retinal as well as a choroidal circulation. Studies by Hendrickson and Hicks, 2002 and Voss et al. 2007, show that the pig retina has a high density of cones. A large horizontal band running across the retina at and above the optic disc (OD) contains the highest cone density, and corresponds to a similar streak of high ganglion cell density. This band is also free of large blood vessels. These characteristics are similar to those of the human fovea.",
                        "The distribution of cones within the retina may have strong impact on biology of the retina itself and on the effect of treatments. Indeed, the neuroretina comprises both rods and cones that can be distributed differently depending on the species, as described herein. Rods are known to secrete trophic factors or survival factors. The position and distribution of cones within the rods population may thus impact on the protective effect on cones of such secreted factors. The rod-secreted factors may affect differently cone cells if they are scattered or clustered in particular regions of the retina. In the same way, degenerating cells are known to influence the biology of nearby cells. Rods that are degenerating may thus have different effects of nearby cones, depending on their scattered (i.e. in mouse or rat) or clustered organization (i.e. in pig or human, as herein demonstrated).",
