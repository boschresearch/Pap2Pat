## EXPERIMENTAL PART

### Porcine Cone Arrestin-3 Promoter Design

- design porcine promoter sequence

### Lentiviral Constructs

- generate lentiviral constructs with porcine promoter and human GUCY2D cDNA

### Generation of Transgenic Animals

- produce transgenic pigs using lentiviral constructs

### Genotyping of Pigs and Transgene Expression in the Retina

- genotype pigs and analyze transgene expression in retina

### Example 5

- measure retinal function using electroretinogram and optical coherence tomography
- evaluate visual behavior using maze and obstacle tests
- analyze histology of transgenic and control animals
