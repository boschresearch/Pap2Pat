    "abstract": "Diagnosis of disease outside of sophisticated laboratories urgently requires low-cost, user-friendly devices. Disposable, instrument-free testing devices are used for home and physician office testing, but are limited in applicability to a small class of highly abundant analytes. Direct, unambiguous visual read-out is an ideal way to deliver a result on a disposable device; however, existing strategies that deliver appropriate sensitivity produce only subtle colour changes. Here we report a new approach, which we term electrocatalytic fluid displacement, where a molecular binding event is transduced into an electrochemical current, which drives the electrodeposition of a metal catalyst. The catalyst promotes bubble formation that displaces a fluid to reveal a high contrast change. We couple the read-out system to a nanostructured microelectrode and demonstrate direct visual detection of 100 fM DNA in 10 min. This represents the lowest limit of detection of nucleic acids reported using high contrast visual read-out.",

                        "The electrocatalytic fluid displacement (EFD) approach is based on the electrodeposition of platinum, which catalyses the evolution of a bubble that actuates a fluid (Fig. 1). An electrochemical sensor is connected to a read-out chamber by a metallic bridge (Fig. 2a). On the introduction of the sample, the target analyte hybridizes to the complementary probe functionalized on the surface of the sensor (Fig. 2a). After hybridization, the electrocatalytic solution is introduced into the sensing chamber (Fig. 2b). On the application of a potential at 250\u2009mV for 10\u2009s, ruthenium is oxidized at the sensing electrode and platinum is simultaneously electrodeposited at a mesh electrode in the read-out chamber. The current is further amplified by two additional reducing agents in the electrocatalytic solution. After the application of the potential, hydrogen peroxide is introduced into the read-out chamber (Fig. 2c). The deposited platinum catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, which forms a bubble. The growing bubble displaces a fluid to reveal a colour change. In the case of read-out based on dye displacement, the opaque dye is displaced and the read-out window becomes transparent revealing a blue spot underneath the device (Fig. 2d). In the case of read-out based on a structural colour change, the growing bubble causes an index mismatch that unveils the diffraction grating patterned in the underside of the PDMS chamber lid, which causes light to diffract into its component colours (Fig. 2e).",
                        "To sense nucleic acids, the EFD read-out system is connected to a nanostructured microelectrode (NME), which acts as an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor (Fig. 2a)1723. The NME sensors were fabricated on silicon substrates using a two-step electrodeposition process as previously described23. The gold microstructures protrude from the surface and reach into solution, which increases the probability of interaction with the target molecules23. The sensors are decorated with a second layer of finely nanostructured gold. The nanoscale roughness maximizes sensitivity by enhancing the hybridization efficiency of the probe and target2425. These sensors have been used previously to detect a variety of chemical and biomolecular targets262728.",
                        "We use a multi-pronged strategy to minimize the current in the absence of target nucleic acid. We functionalize the sensors using a charge-neutral probe, and we read the current using a novel electrochemical assay. Specifically, the sensors are functionalized with thiolated peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes complementary to the target sequence. PNA is a synthetic nucleic acid analogue that has a neutral charge. This neutral charge minimizes the background current and increases the signal-to-noise ratio.",
                        "After target hybridization and washing (Fig. 2a), we read-out the electrochemical signals using an electrochemical-chemical-chemical (ECC) redox cycle reporter system, which radically amplifies the current. It is worth noting that this is the first reported use of ECC for the detection nucleic acids29. To simplify the electronics in a disposable device, we use a DC potential for read-out as opposed to voltammetry, which requires a potential sweep and thus more complicated electronics. Using a DC potential, it is not possible to resolve the contribution from unwanted redox reactions occurring at nearby potentials to the overall signal. In the past we have used an electrocatalytic redox reporter system consisting of ruthenium hexamine and ferricyanide for nucleic acid detection using differential pulse voltammetry30, but this gave high background currents using DC potential amperometry. At the reduction potential of ruthenium hexamine, ferricyanide is reduced as well, which contributes to the overall current even in the absence of bound-target nucleic acids. Therefore, we designed the ECC redox reporter system such that there are no interfering redox reactions near the potential of interest.",
                        "Our new assay employs Ru(NH3)63+, mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) and cysteamine. Ru(NH3)63+ is electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the bound target nucleic acids. On the application of a potential at 250\u2009mV, Ru(NH3)63+ is oxidized to Ru(NH3)64+ (ref. 31). The MPA present in solution chemically reduces Ru(NH3)64+ back to Ru(NH3)63+, allowing for multiple turnovers of Ru(NH3)63+, which generates a high electrocatalytic current. This signal is further amplified by cysteamine, another reducing agent, which is chemically oxidized to cystamine by reducing the oxidized form of MPA (R-S-S-R) back to its reduced form (R-SH).",
                        "This electrical current from the sensor is coupled to the EFD electrode immersed in a platinum solution to drive the deposition of the catalyst. When the NME is challenged with the target analyte, the current drives the electrodeposition of platinum on the EFD electrode, which catalytically forms a bubble that displaces the dye to reveal the blue spot. When the target sequence is not present, the current is too low to deposit a sufficient amount of platinum to catalyse bubble growth and no colour change occurs."

To study the prospective performance of this approach, we calculated the predicted time required to induce a visible colour change using a variety of transduction strategies.",
                        "We illustrate the challenge of directly inducing a colour change by considering the example of electrodepositing an optically discernible quantity of metal. A 1\u2009nA current applied for 10\u2009s supplies 6 \u00d7 1010 electrons, which can turnover a maximum of 6 \u00d7 1010 molecules. Even under the generous assumption that a single molecular layer is visible, given an atomic radius of 1\u2009\u00c5, this yields a spot of only 50\u2009\u03bcm \u00d7 50\u2009\u03bcm. This is too small to be easily visible to the naked eye as the spatial resolution of human eyesight is \u223c100\u2013200\u2009\u03bcm (ref. 32).",
                        "We hypothesized that we could instead develop a means to amplify, by orders of magnitude, the colour change per charge. We would electrodeposit a catalyst, such as platinum, to turn on the colorimetric reaction19. By depositing a catalyst, each electron effectively converts multiple molecules, amplifying the colour transformation. However, as Fig. 3 shows, even the catalytic reduction of an electrochromic compound in bulk solution requires exceedingly long times to induce a visible change. Assuming a 50-\u03bcm tall chamber with a 200\u2009\u03bcm diameter window filled with enough pigment, with the absorbance of malachite green, to give an OD of 1, it would take over 4\u2009h to turnover the compound using the platinum deposited from a 1\u2009nA current.",
                        "Thus, instead of catalytic reduction of a solution-based pigment, we considered catalytic evolution of gas as an equivalent molar amount of gas occupies a much larger volume than a liquid. At STP, the volume of one mole of gas is 22.4\u2009l, which is three orders of magnitude larger than a mole of liquid H2O (18\u2009ml). Platinum is an excellent catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to form oxygen and water33. As shown in Fig. 3, the catalytic production of a visible bubble that fills the same window requires under 3\u2009min, over 80 times faster than catalytic reduction of an electrochromic dye in solution.",

After depositing platinum for 10\u2009s at 1\u2009nA, we introduced hydrogen peroxide and measured the rate of bubble growth using a microscope (Fig. 4a). Although we did not observe rapid bubble growth, we noticed that bubbles formed preferentially at the electrode edges.",

We applied 1\u2009nA for 10\u2009s to deposit platinum and recorded the rate of bubble growth (Fig. 4a). We found that the rate of bubble evolution increased with increasing numbers of edges. The highest density mesh, with 3.4 \u00d7 the edge to surface area ratio of the rectangular electrode, provided the fastest bubble growth. No bubbles formed when no current was applied as no platinum was electrodeposited. Bubble growth was not observed after immersing the device in platinum solution for 25\u2009min, indicating that platinum is not deposited via electroless deposition (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

As structural colour changes rely on the index matching at an interface, the colour change is largely independent of the path length through the index-matching medium. Thus, we could expect a vibrant colour change using a device with a much smaller channel height than required when using dye displacement. As the substrate provides the colour, there is no need to increase the opacity of the peroxide by introducing additional compounds, which might interfere with the reaction.",

As the index of refraction of peroxide (n=1.35) is similar to that of PDMS (n=1.4), the diffraction grating is invisible to incoming light when the device is initially loaded with peroxide. As the bubble forms, the peroxide is replaced with O2, which has an index of refraction of 1. This index mismatch between the bubble and PDMS unveils the diffraction grating. The incident white light is diffracted into its component colours to reveal the circular spot.",

The window turns from optically transparent (which appears as black due to a black background) to cyan as light at that wavelength is diffracted towards the camera. Using a 1\u2009nA deposition current, the spot size is 0.06\u2009mm2 after 1\u2009min, which is visible by eye. This spot grows to 0.36\u2009mm2 and 1.1\u2009mm2 by 5 and 15\u2009min, respectively.

To bridge electronically the sensor and read-out device, a platinum wire electrode immersed in the ECC solution is connected to a second platinum electrode in the electrodeposition bath.

We use three stages of amplification to transform ultra-low currents into colorimetric changes. The ECC redox assay uses two chemical catalysis steps to amplify the electrodeposition current. Thus, each bound nucleic acid is converted into multiple deposited platinum atoms. Next, by electrodepositing a catalyst, the colorimetric reaction continues long after the initial application of the electrochemical current, obviating the need for high currents to induce colorimetric changes. Last, colorimetric read-out is accelerated by exploiting the fact that a gas occupies a much larger volume than an equivalent molar amount of liquid. A catalytic reaction can evolve a large volume of gas much faster than it can turnover a visible amount of dye of the same volume.",
