    "abstract": "Itaconic acid is an important biomass-derived chemical building block but has also recently been identified as a metabolite produced in mammals, which has antimicrobial activity. The biosynthetic pathway of itaconic acid has been elucidated in the ascomycetous fungus Aspergillus terreus and in human macrophages. In both organisms itaconic acid is generated by decarboxylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. Here, we show that the basidiomycetous fungus Ustilago maydis uses an alternative pathway and produces itaconic acid via trans-aconitate, the thermodynamically favoured isomer of cis-aconitate. We have identified a gene cluster that contains all genes involved in itaconic acid formation. Trans-aconitate is generated from cis-aconitate by a cytosolic aconitate-\u0394-isomerase (Adi1) that belongs to the PrpF family of proteins involved in bacterial propionate degradation. Decarboxylation of trans-aconitate is catalyzed by a novel enzyme, trans-aconitate decarboxylase (Tad1). Tad1 displays significant sequence similarity with bacterial 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes (CMLE). This suggests that U. maydis has evolved an alternative biosynthetic pathway for itaconate production using the toxic intermediate trans-aconitate. Overexpression of a pathway-specific transcription factor (Ria1) or a mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid transporter (Mtt1) resulted in a twofold increase in itaconate yield. Therefore, our findings offer new strategies for biotechnological production of this valuable biomass-derived chemical.",

                "The unsaturated dicarboxylic acid itaconate (Fig.\u20091A) is commercially used in the production of pharmaceuticals, adhesives and as a copolymer for synthetic resins. Microbial itaconate production was first described for the ascomycetous fungus Aspergillus itaconicus (Kinoshita, 1932) and the related species Aspergillus terreus is still used for industrial production of itaconate via fermentation (Willke and Vorlop, 2001; Okabe et\u2009al., 2009; Klement and B\u00fcchs, 2013). Itaconic acid is also an interesting starting material for biofuel production because it can easily be converted into 3\u2010methyltetrahydrofuran (3\u2010MTHF), a fuel with excellent physical and chemical combustion properties (Geilen et\u2009al., 2010). Therefore, itaconic acid is regarded as one of the \u2018top value added chemicals from biomass\u2019 that can be subsequently converted to a number of high\u2010value chemicals or materials in the industry (Werpy and Petersen, 2004).",
                "Quite recently, itaconate production by mammalian macrophages during inflammation has also been observed (Sugimoto et\u2009al., 2012; Michelucci et\u2009al., 2013; Cordes et\u2009al., 2015). There, it serves as an immune\u2010supportive metabolite that blocks the bacterial glyoxylate shunt by inhibition of isocitrate lyase (McFadden and Purohit, 1977). Numerous human pathogenic bacteria have evolved itaconate degradation and detoxification pathways as counter\u2010response, emphasizing the medical relevance for itaconate and its biochemistry (Sasikaran et\u2009al., 2014). For fungi, itaconate production is likely beneficial in an ecological context through several effects. In general, production of organic acids enables the liberation of micronutrients, such as phosphate and metals through chelating properties of the acids and a decrease of pH (Whitelaw, 1999; Landeweert et\u2009al., 2001). This pH decrease, combined with a high tolerance to low pH of the producing organism, provides a competitive advantage in carbon\u2010rich environments (Cray et\u2009al., 2013), complemented by the specific action of itaconate as inhibitor of isocitrate lyase (McFadden and Purohit, 1977).",
                "A biosynthetic route for microbial itaconate formation via enzymatic decarboxylation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate cis\u2010aconitate has been proposed already in 1957 (Bentley and Thiessen, 1957a, 1957b). The responsible genes, however, were identified only recently. The A.\u2009terreus cadA gene encodes a cis\u2010aconitate decarboxylase, which converts cis\u2010aconitate into itaconate (Dwiarti et\u2009al., 2002; Kanamasa et\u2009al., 2008). The cadA gene is part of a gene cluster that also comprises a mitochondrial TCA transporter, a membrane permease and a transcription factor proposed to regulate pathway\u2010specific expression of cluster genes (Li et\u2009al., 2011). The biochemical elucidation of itaconate production, including its genetic background, has led to a surge of metabolic engineering efforts in recent years with itaconate production established in several heterologous hosts (Kanamasa et\u2009al., 2008; Li et\u2009al., 2012; Blumhoff et\u2009al., 2013; Klement and B\u00fcchs, 2013; Blazeck et\u2009al., 2014; Huang et\u2009al., 2014; Okamoto et\u2009al., 2014; Chin et\u2009al., 2015; Vuoristo et\u2009al., 2015).",
                "Itaconate production has also been observed in the phytopathogenic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis in a range of up to 45\u2009g\u2009l\u22121 (Haskins et\u2009al., 1955; Guevarra and Tabuchi, 1990; Klement and B\u00fcchs, 2013; Maassen et\u2009al., 2014). Ustilago maydis serves as an important model organism due to its well\u2010characterized genome to study fungal virulence in plants (Kaemper et\u2009al., 2006; Brefort et\u2009al., 2009). In addition, the single\u2010celled (yeast\u2010like) morphology of this fungus in liquid media provides a major advantage in submerged fermentations by circumventing several problems of filamentous fungi, such as elevated viscosity and clogging, hindered oxygen transfer, sensitivity to hydro\u2010mechanical stress and laborious handling of spores (Klement et\u2009al., 2012). Therefore, we sought to investigate the itaconate biosynthesis pathway in U.\u2009maydis."

                        "Genome analysis revealed that U.\u2009maydis contains no orthologue of the A.\u2009terreus cis\u2010aconitate decarboxylase CadA, which belongs to the PrpD family of proteins. This suggests that U.\u2009maydis uses an alternative biosynthetic route for itaconic acid production. We noticed that the U.\u2009maydis genome contains three genes (UMAG_02807, UMAG_06058 and UMAG_11778 ) coding for PrpF family proteins related to the 3\u2010methylitaconate\u2010\u0394\u2010isomerase Mii. Mii converts methylitaconate into dimethylmaleate during nicotinate fermentation by Eubacterium barkeri and also shows activity towards itaconate (Velarde et\u2009al., 2009). Gene disruption experiments revealed that deletion of UMAG_11778 abolished itaconate production (Fig.\u20091B and Supporting Information Fig. S1), pointing to an important role for this gene during itaconate biosynthesis. Interestingly, several neighbouring genes are co\u2010regulated with UMAG_11778 during pathogenic development of U.\u2009maydis (Zheng et\u2009al., 2008). To test whether these genes also contribute to itaconate biosynthesis, we performed a systematic deletion analysis of the putative gene cluster (Fig.\u20091D). Itaconate production was completely abolished in mutants disrupted for UMAG_05076, UMAG_11778 or UMAG_05080, whereas deletion of UMAG_11777 and UMAG_05079 resulted in decreased itaconate production (Fig.\u20091B). Deletion of the two leftmost genes of the potential gene cluster (UMAG_05074 and UMAG_12299) did not affect itaconate production significantly (Fig.\u20091B), although they appear to be co\u2010regulated in planta (Zheng et\u2009al., 2008). The fully annotated sequence of the cluster is deposited in NCBI GenBank under accession number (NCBI GenBank KT852988)."

UMAG_05074 encodes a P450 monooxygenase of the CYP504 family and UMAG_12299 a ring cleaving dioxygenase (Table\u20091). Therefore, we named the respective genes cyp3 and rdo1. UMAG_05080 is predicted to encode a basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) transcription factor (Table\u20091). Deletion of UMAG_05080 resulted in significant reduction of expression (UMAG_05079 90%, UMAG_11778 85%, UMAG_11777 70%, UMAG_05076, UMAG_05074 and UMAG_12299 each 30%), whereas the overexpression of UMAG_05080 was sufficient to trigger expression of most cluster genes (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Therefore, we assume that UMAG_05080 encodes a pathway\u2010specific regulator of itaconate biosynthesis and renamed the corresponding gene ria1 (regulator of itaconic acid)."

The gene product of UMAG_05076 is highly similar to prokaryotic 3\u2010carboxy\u2010cis,cis\u2010muconate lactonizing enzyme (CMLE) and the product of UMAG_11778 belongs to the PrpF family of isomerases (Grimek and Escalante\u2010Semerena, 2004; Velarde et\u2009al., 2009; Nogales et\u2009al., 2011) (see Table\u20091). To test whether these two genes are directly responsible for itaconate biosynthesis, we expressed both in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although single expression of either gene did not trigger itaconate production, co\u2010expression of UMAG_05076 and UMAG_11778 resulted in itaconate production in this heterologous host (Fig.\u20092).",

Itaconate production from trans\u2010aconitate was not observed in \u0394UMAG_05076 cells, indicating that the catalytic activity of UMAG_05076 is required for itaconate formation."

UMAG_05076 was able to convert trans\u2010aconitate completely into itaconate within 15\u2009min (Fig.\u20094A), whereas cis\u2010aconitate was not converted (Fig.\u20094B). This indicates that the gene product of UMAG_05076 acts as a decarboxylase specific for trans\u2010aconitate (Fig.\u20094C).

We reasoned that during itaconate formation, trans\u2010aconitate might be generated from cis\u2010aconitate by the gene product of UMAG_11778. Indeed, recombinant GST\u2010UMAG_11778 fusion protein purified from E.\u2009coli was able to isomerize cis\u2010aconitate into trans\u2010aconitate in vitro (Fig.\u20094B).

Both Adi1 and Tad1 were located in the cytosol but were also found in the nucleus (Fig.\u20095A). The gene product of UMAG_05079 is similar to mitochondrial TCA transporters (Table\u20091) and accumulated at distinct locations in mitochondria (Fig.\u20095B). UMAG_11777 is annotated as major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter (Table\u20091) and was found at the plasma membrane. Based on these data, we propose that the gene product of UMAG_05079 actively exports cis\u2010aconitate from mitochondria into the cytosol. There it is converted into itaconate and secreted across the plasma membrane by the major facilitator UMAG_11777 (Fig.\u20096). Accordingly, we termed these transport proteins Mtt1 (mitochondrial TCA transporter) and Itp1 (itaconate transport protein) respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrate that U.\u2009maydis uses an alternative metabolic pathway to generate itaconate via the unusual intermediate trans\u2010aconitate."

Surprisingly, overexpression of the P450 monooxygenase Cyp3 (Fig.\u20091C) caused a significant decrease in itaconate production to 20% of the wildtype level, most likely caused by P450\u2010dependent oxidation of itaconate (see Discussion)."

                "So far, the molecular basis of itaconate biosynthesis has been elucidated only in the ascomycetous fungus A.\u2009terreus and in human macrophages (Kanamasa et\u2009al., 2008; Li et\u2009al., 2011; Michelucci et\u2009al., 2013). In both organisms, itaconate is generated by decarboxylation of cis\u2010aconitate. In A.\u2009terreus, the key enzyme CadA is part of a gene cluster that also contains mitochondrial and plasma membrane transporters and a transcription factor (Li et\u2009al., 2011). Here, we could show that in the basidiomycete U.\u2009maydis itaconate is produced by decarboxylation of trans\u2010aconitate. The critical enzyme Tad1 is remarkably different to A.\u2009terreus CadA. While CadA is related to pro\u2010 and eukaryotic methylcitrate\u2010dehydratases of the PrpD family, which catalyze an unusual syn\u2010elimination of water from (2S,3S)\u20102\u2010methylcitrate, U.\u2009maydis Tad1 is highly similar to prokaryotic CMLE. Prokaryotic CMLE catalyze \u03b3\u2010lactonization of 3\u2010carboxy\u2010cis,cis\u2010muconate during degradation of aromatic compounds (Harwood and Parales, 1996) via an anti\u20101,2\u2010addition\u2010elimination reaction similar to that of class II fumarases (Williams et\u2009al., 1992). Therefore, we propose that Tad1 catalyzes decarboxylation of trans\u2010aconitate by addition of a proton to the double bond leading to transient formation of a carbenium ion and subsequent anti\u2010elimination of the carboxyl group (Supporting Information Fig. S4).",
                "In U.\u2009maydis, trans\u2010aconitate is produced by isomerization of the TCA intermediate cis\u2010aconitate. We identified the aconitate\u2010\u0394\u2010isomerase Adi1, which catalyzes interconversion of cis\u2010 and trans\u2010aconitate. Such isomerase activity has been described previously for plants that accumulate trans\u2010aconitate as antifeedant (Thompson et\u2009al., 1990) and for bacteria that are able to grow on trans\u2010aconitate (Altekar and Raghaven Rao, 1963). Although the responsible proteins have not been identified yet, biochemical studies in Pseudomonas putida indicated that isomerization proceeds via an allylic rearrangement (Klinman and Rose, 1971). The U.\u2009maydis aconitate isomerase Adi1 is closely related to methylitaconate\u2010\u0394\u2010isomerase Mii from E.\u2009barkeri (Velarde et\u2009al., 2009) and to Shewanella oneidensis PrpF (Grimek and Escalante\u2010Semerena, 2004). For both enzymes, allylic mechanisms have been proposed. Therefore, we assume that Adi1 uses a similar mechanism to catalyse delta\u2010isomerization of cis\u2010aconitate into trans\u2010aconitate.",
                "Overexpression of the P450 monooxygenase Cyp3 led to a drastic decrease of itaconate production, whereas deletion of cyp3 resulted in a slight but not significant increase (P\u2009=\u20090.08). This suggests that itaconate might be a substrate for oxidation by Cyp3. We propose that Cyp3\u2010dependent oxidation results in the formation of 2\u2010hydroxyparaconate, which is a known byproduct of itaconate production in Ustilago species (Guevarra and Tabuchi, 1990). The presence of 2\u2010hydroxyparaconate, however, could not be confirmed yet because standards are not commercially available. The exact action and role of Cyp3 in relation to itaconate production will be studied in more detail in future experiments.",
                "Overexpression of itaconate cluster genes mtt1 and ria1 resulted in significant improvement of itaconate yield. The effect of ria1 is most probably due to direct upregulation of all cluster genes including mtt1 (see Supporting Information Fig. S3). Together, this suggests that the putative mitochondrial cis\u2010aconitate transporter Mtt1 appears to be a bottleneck for itaconate production in U.\u2009maydis. There is an interesting analogy to fungal citrate production, where the ability of the mitochondrial citrate transporter to compete with the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase is critical for efficient citrate production (Karaffa and Kubicek, 2003).",
                "In this manuscript, we describe a novel and alternative pathway for itaconate biosynthesis in U.\u2009maydis involving isomerization of cis\u2010aconitate into trans\u2010aconitate and its subsequent decarboxylation to generate itaconate. The molecular identification of Tad1 and Adi1 allows further biochemical and structural characterization of these interesting enzyme activities. In addition, our findings open up new avenues for metabolic engineering of homologous and heterologous itaconate production strains. Initial overexpression experiments already led to a twofold increase in itaconate production. Combinatorial overexpression of multiple genes will likely lead to further improvements, enabling to use U.\u2009maydis for sustainable large\u2010scale itaconate production."

Transformation of U.\u2009maydis was performed using standard protocols (Schulz et\u2009al., 1990). For selection of transformants, PDA plates with 200\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 of hygromycin (Duchefa Biochemie) or 2\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 of carboxin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) were used. Correct integration of constructs was verified by Southern analysis or by PCR. For all deletion mutants itaconate production could be restored by complementation with the respective genes in trans, with the exception of deletion mutant UMAG_05080. This might be possibly related to lack of expression of this transcriptional regulator due to the ectopic insertion at the ip\u2010locus. For localization studies GFP\u2010fusion proteins generated in plasmid p123 were overexpressed in the respective deletion strains."
