In certain exemplary embodiments, a microwave field is applied to the diamond and optically exciting the diamond under green light. The photoluminescent response of the diamond is measured by a photodetector.

They can be utilized in a number of applications, including communication, computation, mobile devices, sensors, autonomous vehicles, undersea oil/gas exploration, space navigation, aviation, cruise missiles, and navigation systems (e.g. global positioning systems (GPS)).",

When an oscillating magnetic field is resonant with the energy difference of these internal states, a change in population between levels changes the radiofrequency or optical absorption. Certain techniques can modulate the driving frequency and monitor the absorption as a correction for a tunable active reference oscillator, e.g. a quartz crystal, thus stabilizing it to the atomic line.",

The substitution of a nitrogen atom for a carbon atom in the diamond structure can create a lattice vacancy that can be occupied by three unpaired electrons. In a neutral nitrogen vacancy defect, N\u2014V0, two of the unpaired electrons can form a quasi covalent bond, while the third electron remains unpaired. However, the three electrons can exhibit axial symmetry, and the three continuously exchange roles. A negative nitrogen vacancy, N\u2014V\u2032, can have an additional electron associated with the vacancy which forms an S=1 structure that has a long-lived spin triplet in its ground state that can be probed using optical and microwave excitation. This can allow for spin manipulation of the NVC.",

Spin-spin interaction can lead to a zero-field splitting between the ms=0 and ms=\u00b11 manifolds, where the quantization axis is along the NV-axis. NVCs can have a crystal field splitting frequency (Dgs) of, for example, 2.870 GHz in the absence of an external magnetic field and in the absence of other environmental factors, including strain. This zero-field splitting frequency can be changed by the application of magnetic fields in the direction of the NVC through the Zeeman effect."

In one embodiment, the method can include applying an initial, adjustable microwave field to a diamond structure. Optical excitation of the diamond structure can produce a detectable photoluminescent response, with that response being modulated in intensity by the frequency of the microwave field being applied. From the modulation of the photoluminescent response, the phase shift between the microwave field and the crystal field splitting frequency of the nitrogen vacancy center in the diamond structure can be determined. The frequency of the microwave field can be adjusted until the detected phase shift is below a predetermined threshold. That microwave frequency then can be used as the frequency standard.",

The use of multiple nitrogen vacancy centers can provide additional accuracy in the measurement of the frequency standard.",

For example, the diamond structure can be first subjected to optical pumping to drive the spin state of a plurality of nitrogen vacancy centers to the |0> state. After optical pumping ceases, a first microwave pulse of flip angle \u03c0/4 can be applied to the diamond structure. After a time T, a second microwave pulse of flip angle \u03c0 can be applied in the opposite phase of the first pulse. After a second time T, a third microwave pulse identical to the first microwave pulse can be applied. Following the third microwave pulse, the transient fluorescent response of the diamond structure can be measured by applying an optical pulse. The measurement of the transient fluorescent response can be used to calculate the phase shift of the initial microwave pulse frequency from the crystal field splitting frequency.",

The dielectric cavity can include a pair of Bragg reflectors placed on opposite sides of the diamond structure and outside the plane of the stripline for microwave emissions. The Bragg reflectors can create a 532 nm resonant cavity encompassing the diamond structure. The light source can be a surface emitting laser adapted for generation of a doubled 1064 nm beam.",

The processor can be configured to detect the phase shift for both diamond structures and thereby stabilize the measurements for temperature dependence. In a further embodiment, the two diamond structures can be clamped to two substrates with different thermal expansion coefficients.

Diamond structures can have many desirable characteristics for providing a frequency standard. For example, a single crystal diamond can be grown into a micron-scale, radiation hard chip, which makes it portable and well-suited for integration in a semiconductor fabrication process. Additionally, a frequency standard derived from the spin lifetime of the nitrogen vacancy center (NVC) can resemble atomic and molecular systems. The optical detection of the NVC can also increase the signal-to-noise ratio for a solid-state standard. A sufficiently high density of NVCs in a chip can allow for comparable frequency stability in smaller sensor volumes.",

In another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, techniques for obtaining a frequency standard from the crystal field splitting frequency of a nitrogen vacancy center in a diamond structure can include a pulsed technique, applying one or more microwave pulses to a diamond structure, and then observing the transient photoluminescent response by applying an optical pulse. In yet another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, techniques for obtaining a frequency standard from the crystal field splitting frequency of a nitrogen vacancy center in a diamond structure can include using temperature stabilization techniques to improve the accuracy of the frequency standard.",

                        "A diamond chip containing NVCs 110 on a substrate 119 can be exposed to optical and microwave emissions. The diamond chip can be grown onto the substrate, for example, via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Alternatively, a pre-fabricated diamond chip can be implanted on or integrated with the substrate. The photoluminescent (PL) response from the optical excitation can be detected using a photodetector 140 and the phase shift between the microwave emission and the field-splitting frequency, Dgs, of the NVC can be determined using a processor 150.",
                        "The optical emissions can be created by a light source 120 arranged to illuminate one face of the diamond chip. The light source can be configured to produce, for example a laser beam 125 having a specific power level 121 and a specific wavelength 123. In one embodiment, the light source can be configured to produce a 1064 nm laser that is doubled prior to interacting with the diamond chip 125. Alternatively, the light source can be configured to produce approximately a 520-550 nm laser, and in certain embodiments can be configured to produce a 520 nm laser.",
                        "A dielectric cavity 115 can be placed around the diamond chip 110 to lower the power requirements for the laser beam 125. The dielectric cavity can be formed for example by a pair of Bragg reflectors, which can create a 532 nm resonant cavity around the diamond chip 110. One of the Bragg reflectors can be placed between the diamond chip 110 and the light source 120 and the second reflector can be placed on the opposite side. The Bragg reflectors can be made of a quarter wave stack of materials with different reflective indices, using for example, materials such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, tantalum pentoxide, or the like. This can allow the laser beam 125 to resonate within the cavity and can cause optical excitation of the NVCs in the diamond chip 110.",
                        "The microwave field can be created by a planar stripline 131 that can encircle the diamond chip 110 on a single plane as seen in FIG. 4. Alternatively, the microwave field can be created by other suitable techniques, for example with other geometries and suitable antennas. The microwave cavity can also be fitted with reflectors to create a resonant cavity 111 for microwave emissions, for example at 2.87 GHz. A frequency controller 160 can determine the frequency of the microwave emissions based on input data from a microprocessor 150, and can report the frequency back to the microprocessor 151.",
                        "The optical emissions can excite the NVCs, to produce a photoluminescent (PL) response 127. NVCs can absorb green light and emit a PL response between, for example, 637-800 nm. As described in more detail below, the intensity of the PL response can correspond to the polarization of the spin states of the NVC, which can depend on the frequency of the microwave field. Thus, the processor 150 can determine, based on a signal from the photodetctor 140, when the PL response corresponds to an applied microwave field equal to a known field-splitting frequency of the NVC, and thus can lock the frequency controller 160 at such a frequency, thereby providing a frequency standard.",
                        "Exemplary embodiments of techniques for providing a frequency standard using spin states of a defect in diamond will be described in detail below. For purposes of illustration, and not limitation, the level structure and fluorescent properties of the nitrogen vacancy, as they relate to exemplary and non-limiting bases for a frequency standard disclosed herein (e.g., the zero-field splitting of the NV as a frequency standard), will first be described. However, one or ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that certain properties of the NV center in diamond are well known, and the following description is not intended to limit or otherwise narrow the scope of the disclosed subject matter. Additionally, throughout the following description, certain characterizations of stability and quality factor will be described for purposes of illustration, and not limitation. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that such characterizations are not intended to limit or otherwise narrow the scope of the disclosed subject matter, but are provided as an exemplary method of describing the techniques disclosed herein.",
                        "Atomic clocks, generally, can drive their stability from a large quality factor (\u201cQ-factor\u201d), which can be given as Q=v/\u0394v, of the probed resonance, with narrow linewidth, \u0394v, being smaller than the resonant frequency v. The NYC in diamond can have a ground state spin triplet characterized by long coherence times (for example, greater than 1 ms), a ground state crystal field splitting with an intrinsic resonance frequency near 2.870 GHz, which can be independent, to lowest order, of applied magnetic field, and spin states that are optically polarizable and detectable on single defect length scales (for example, approximately 1 \u03bcm).",
                        "With reference to FIG. 5(a), relevant spin sublevels of the NVC (0, 1, 2, 3 and S) are depicted. Optical absorption of green laser light can cause broadband photoluminescence (PL) of the NVC from, for example, 637-800 nm. A spin dependent intersystem crossing between the excited spin triplet 3 and the metastable, dark singlet level S can change the integrated PL for the spin states |0> and |\u00b11. The deshelving from the singlet can occur primarily to the |0> spin state, providing a means to polarize the NVC. Microwave fields resonant between levels |0> and |1> can perturb the spin populations, and thus the PL response. This can be characterized, for example, in two ways: 1) by measuring a continuous wave response to simultaneous optical and microwave fields (for example, as demonstrated in FIG. 5(b), or 2) in a pulsed manner, by preparing a state using only microwaves, and observing the transient PL response.",
