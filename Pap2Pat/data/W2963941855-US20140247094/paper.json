    "abstract": "Frequency standards based on atomic states, such as Rb or Cs vapors, or single-trapped ions, are the most precise measures of time. Here we propose and analyze a precision oscillator approach based upon spins in a solid-state system, in particular, the nitrogen-vacancy defect in single-crystal diamond. We show that this system can have stability approaching portable atomic standards and is readily incorporable as a chip-scale device. Using a pulsed spin-echo technique, we anticipate an Allan deviation of ${ensuremath{sigma}}_{y}={10}^{ensuremath{-}7}{ensuremath{tau}}^{ensuremath{-}1/2}$ limited by thermally-induced strain variations; in the absence of such thermal fluctuations, the system is limited by spin dephasing and harbors an Allan deviation nearing $ensuremath{sim}{10}^{ensuremath{-}12}{ensuremath{tau}}^{ensuremath{-}1/2}$. Potential improvements based upon advanced diamond material processing, temperature stabilization, and nanophotonic engineering are discussed.",

                "Atomic clocks are the most accurate systems for measuring time and frequency. They are used in a broad array of applications, ranging from communication and computation (e.g., precise broadcast frequency standards) to navigation [e.g., the global positioning system (GPS)]. Modern frequency standards derive their stability from the precisely measured internal hyperfine level splittings of atoms of cesium, rubidium, or hydrogen. When an oscillating magnetic field is resonant with the energy difference of these internal states, a change in population between levels alters the radio frequency or optical absorption. Standard lock-in techniques modulate the driving frequency and monitor the absorption as a correction for a tunable active reference oscillator, e.g., a quartz crystal, thus stabilizing it to the atomic resonance line [1]. Recent experiments on single-trapped ions [2] and on ensembles of atoms trapped in optical lattices [3,4] have far exceeded the international cesium standard, enabling the observation of general relativity corrections at distances of a few meters [5]. Such precision, however, comes at the expense of mobility, as the infrastructure for these standards encompasses several tens of cubic meters of space. At the other extreme, portable standards based on rubidium vapor cells provide excellent stability for time scales ranging from 1 to 10 4 s and find usage in satellites, laboratory equipment, and cellular communications [6]. Mobile devices, which typically do not contain their own precision standards, can share GPS time signals for maintaining communication standards, but when the external lock signal is obstructed, a precise local frequency standard with minimal drift is necessary to maintain synchronization.",
                "To address this need, several groups have miniaturized these atomic standards on chip through the aid of modern microfabrication techniques applied to detectors and lasers [7][8][9]. Here, we propose a solid-state alternative based upon electronic spin states in the negatively charged nitrogenvacancy center (NV) center in diamond. This diamond system offers a host of potential advantages, while at the same time pointing to some unique challenges related to the complex solid-state environment. First, single-crystal diamond can be grown into a micron-scale, radiation hard chip, which makes it portable and well suited for integration in a semiconductor fabrication process [10]. Second, this solid-state system derives its performance as a clock from exceptional spin lifetimes of the NV [11] and closely resembles atomic and molecular systems. The optical detection of the NV center also increases the signal-to-noise ratio of solid-state standards based on inductive detection [12]. Compared to vapor cells, this standard does not suffer from Doppler or collisional broadening. However, because of the complex mesoscopic environment, both single and ensembles of NV centers exhibit increased homogeneous linewidths compared to atomic standards [13]. The higher density of defects in solids allows for a comparable frequency stability in smaller sensor volumes when ensemble effects can be mitigated. Similar to atomic clocks, temperature fluctuations can degrade the clock stability. For the NV center, these temperature changes induce a shift in the resonance frequency of the entire ensemble.",
                "In this paper, we analyze both the potential advantages and limitations of an NV-based frequency standard and precision oscillator and describe techniques to compensate for thermally-induced strain variations which limit the clock's performance. Using such temperature stabilization methods, we estimate a stability, expressed as an Allan deviation, which approaches \u03c3 y \u2248 2 \u00d7 10 -10 at 1 s of averaging for a 0.1 mm 3 diamond sample with an ensemble of NVs. Paired with potentially modest operational power requirements, this NV clock could result in a new generation of portable solid-state precision oscillator.",
                "Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we begin with a brief review of the NV-level structure and fluorescence properties, before moving on to a discussion of the zero-field splitting as a possible frequency standard. We then propose a pulsed approach toward an NV-based clock, offering a comparison of sensitivities along the way. In Sec. III, we discuss the effects of dephasing and inhomogeneous broadening, which will limit the achievable clock sensitivity. In Sec. IV, we address the dominant source of instability, namely, the fact that the zero-field splitting of the NV exhibits a strong temperature dependence. We discuss the origin of this temperature dependence and show that a consistent picture arises if we assume that it results from temperature-induced lattice modulations. We then propose two possible solutions to this challenge, first, by synchronizing two NV clocks and second, by canceling the temperature dependence using engineered strain. Finally, in Sec. V, we conclude by comparing the NV frequency standard with other state-of-the-art chip-based clocks."

                "An atomic clock derives its stability from the large quality factor Q = \u03bd/ \u03bd of the probed resonance, with narrow linewidth \u03bd being much smaller than the resonant frequency \u03bd. In the solid state, we desire (i) a microwave transition (\u03bd \u223c GHz) that also exhibits a large Q; (ii) a resonance that does not vary due to material or fabrication processes; and (iii) a precise method of measuring population changes. The NV center in diamond satisfies these criteria by having a ground state spin triplet characterized by long (>1 ms) coherence times, a ground state crystal field splitting with an intrinsic resonance frequency near 2.870 GHz, which is independent, to lowest order, of applied magnetic field, and spin states that are optically polarizable and detectable on single defect length scales (\u223c1 \u03bcm).",
                "We construct a simple model for the relevant NV spin dynamics by considering a Hamiltonian for the lowest and first excited triplet state as well as two metastable singlet states. Figure 1(a) shows the relevant spin sublevels: 0, 1, 2, 3, and S, which are two of the ground state spin sublevels, two of the excited state sublevels, and a metastable singlet state, respectively. For the purposes of a frequency standard, we monitor the fluorescence response of only the ground state triplet sublevels (0 and 1) to resonant microwave excitation, yielding the ground state Hamiltonian [14] ",

The local electric field vector, induced by crystal strain, is \u03c3 . We assume there is no applied external electric field. In the limit of static applied magnetic and instrinsic electric fields that change the magnetic sublevel energies much smaller than D gs , the eigenfunctions are those of the S z operator, as shown in Fig. 1.",

The intrinsic linewidth is limited by the paramagnetic and nuclear spin environments which fluctuate during the measurement. This linewidth broadens if the microwave and optical transitions are driven near saturation (\"power broadening\"); however, higher pump powers also increase the depth of the dip (C \u2192 1). Indeed, far below optical saturation, the PL rate is sufficiently small, and the modulation depth (C) is reduced, so as to cause a decrease in the stability per averaging time.",
                "As Q is the most important factor for stability, there exists an optimal condition, which balances the line broadening with the reduced signal. Under these conditions, we estimate a linewidth of 3.6 MHz (T * 2 = 88 ns), an off-resonance fluorescence rate of \u223c9400 photon/s (accounting for a finite detector efficiency), and a 17% modulation depth. With these parameters, \u03c3 y (\u03c4 ) = 8.124 \u00d7 10 -5 \u03c4 -1/2 for a single NV.",
                "In short, single or ensembles of NV centers lack sufficient stability when monitoring the PL response continuously. This results from the fact that the laser excitation must be reduced far below saturation so that optical power broadening reaches the homogeneous linewidth. At such low pump powers, the fluorescent photon flux is so small that the gains in Q are offset by losses in S/N. As seen in magnetometry studies of the NV [17], a pulsed microwave excitation scheme, which monitors transient fluorescence behavior, can drastically improve the performance beyond the naive continuous excitation or detection method."

The standard two-pulse Ramsey sequence, with time separation T , imprints a phase proportional to the frequency drift \u03b4\u03c9 between two hyperfine states of the atomic system. The PL response varies sinusoidally with \u03b4\u03c9T and can be linearized to provide a passive standard with frequency uncertainty set by T -1 . However, if the system does not remain coherent for times T T c (coherence time), the modulation of the PL response does not persist. In atomic vapor cells, trapped ions, or atomic fountains, T c can be greater than a second due to a complex infrastructure involving magnetic shielding and the minimization of atomic collisions. In the NV system, a spin-bath environment limits T c to tens of microseconds in a typical sample. Quantum memories and ac magnetometers often employ a Hahn echo sequence to extend this coherence time to T 2 by removing slowly varying magnetic fields; however, for frequency standards based on m f = 0 \"clock\" states, the additional \u03c0 pulse of the Hahn echo would completely remove the phase accumulation associated with frequency drift, making it useless for timekeeping.

( 15) cannot be maintained for all times. Unlike an atomic vapor, where collisions and stray magnetic fields dominate the dephasing, in the case of the NV, impurities in the solid-state lattice limit the coherence. However, excellent material growth [11] and precision implantation [10,27] can yield crystals which are largely free of paramagnetic impurities. For a single NV center in an ultrapure diamond sample, spin echo (of duration 2T ) can further improve the observable coherence with a scaling e -(2T /T 2 ) n , where the exponent n \u2248 3 is related to the nuclear spin bath [13,28]. In an ensemble of NVs, where each center has a different bath, and hence, a different T 2 time, the net effect results in an \"averaged\" time constant, T e , and an exponent between n = 1 and n = 2, depending on the NV density [29]. We also note that owing to imperfect conversion efficiency, the NV density in the sample is a fraction of the total number of substitutional nitrogen impurities. Thus, a heavily doped sample, while improving the signal-to-noise ratio, can reduce the overall ensemble coherence time T e . Based on the estimates in Ref. [26], with an NV density of 10 17 /cm 3 , a marginal modification can be expected; Fig. 3 shows the Allan deviation floor due to such dephasing considerations.",

As discussed above, considering an ensemble of defects provides a straightforward route to improving the Allan variance; however, the local strain field within the crystal may vary from center to center resulting in inhomogeneous broadening. Recent room-temperature experiments on bulk diamond (defect fraction of \u223c 10 -13 ) have observed 50-100 kHz variations in the NV D gs of centers spaced at \u223c 1 \u03bcm [30]. These parameters would imply that for an NV-ensemble clock, the sensitivity is, in fact, limited by the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble linewidth T 2,ens \u223c 10-20 \u03bcs.

                "One of the more challenging aspects of an NV frequency standard is the fact that the resonance frequency corresponding to D gs varies as function of temperature, \u03b8 . At room temperature, recent ensemble studies have observed dD gs /d\u03b8 = -74.2(7) kHz/K [32] for millimeter-sized samples. Low-temperature studies, down to 5 K, show that this temperature dependence is, in fact, highly nonlinear; indeed, at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, linearizing yields a much weaker temperature dependence with dD gs /d\u03b8 \u223c 100 Hz/K [33]. Finally, at higher temperatures (up to 600 K), recent work has observed |dD gs /d\u03b8 | = 100 kHz/K, consistent with roomtemperature measurements [34]. The microscopic mechanism which underlies this pronounced zero-field splitting (ZFS) temperature dependence is not yet fully understood, but is thought to be related to the thermal expansion of the diamond. In particular, as temperatures vary, the local lattice spacing of the NV center is distorted causing changes in orbital overlaps which determine D gs . This picture is also consistent with very recent measurements of the room-temperature ZFS of single NV centers in bulk diamond, which also exhibits dD gs /d\u03b8 \u223c -75 kHz/K [30]. Since the ensemble measurement is averaged over all NV orientations, the fact that it agrees identically with the single NV case suggests that crystallographic orientation does not affect dD gs /d\u03b8 , consistent with our proposed mechanism which is owing to the overall thermal expansion of the lattice.",

We note that ensemble averaging would have no beneficial effect here, as all centers shift equally due to isotropic expansion. In the next section, building upon our discussions above, we will show that one might benefit by inducing anisotropy in the crystal's temperature response.

To compensate for even smaller temperature drifts, we employ a protocol (see appendix for the detailed scheme) that exploits the different temperature dependencies of the two diamond samples. Such a \"synchronized composite clock\" has a modified frequency uncertainty:  where ( \u03c9 \u03c9 ) \u03b8=\u03b8 0 is the frequency uncertainty in the ideal limit of no microscopic temperature variations with the ensemble at \u03b8 0 . \u03b2 1,2 = \u03b1 1,2 eff (dD gs /d ) is the relative frequency shift per unit temperature and \u03b2 1,2 is the difference in these shifts.",

To check the validity of this assumption, we model the composite system by finite element analysis as a circular disk of diamond clamped within a brass or tungsten holder, as shown in Fig. 6(c). Figure 6(a) depicts the calculated shift in D gs as a function of temperature; the slopes agree with our previous expression for \u03b2 1,2 \u223c \u03b7 d (1 + \u03b7 c1,2 E c1,2 /E d )/(-75 kHz/K). Finally, Fig. 6(b) shows that the strain is nearly uniform for a large area within the disk across the relevant temperature range \u03b8 \u223c 0.01 K, within the inner 1 mm diameter. Strain variation laterally (in-plane) is zero,within numerical precision, while vertically it is 10 -12 because the diamond buckles. This strain corresponds to D gs of 0.47 Hz, or a fractional frequency deviation of 1.64 \u00d7 10 -10 . Building upon the notion of altering the temperature dependence of the NV ZFS, we next consider the possibility of fully canceling the frequency dependence on temperature, dD gs /d\u03b8 ."

Within the usual ground state Hamiltonian, as expressed in Eq. ( 1), the strain dependence is hidden in the effective electric field vector \u03c3 . In terms of actual components of the strain tensor , perturbations to the spin Hamiltonian take the form F ij kl S i S j kl , where F is the fourth order strain response tensor.

Consider a small temperature shift \u03b8 , near \u03b8 0 , which would cause a diamond slab of length L d to expand by L = L d \u03b7 d \u03b8 . If the diamond slab were instead clamped, this expansion could easily be modulated. For instance, if material 2, which forms the bottom of the clamp, has a low thermal expansion coefficient and high Young's modulus, and material 1 has a high thermal expansion coefficient and high Young's modulus, then a pressure P = E d L d /L = E d \u03b5 d = E d \u03b7 d \u03b8 may be exerted to compress the diamond slab by -L. For temperature changes \u03b8 \u223c 0.01 K, this pressure is \u223c 12.2 kPa. One possible material combination (among many), is to use brass for material 1 and silicon carbide for material 2; tuning of the modulated temperature can then be achieved by altering the width of the brass layer."

                "In summary, we have proposed a solid-state spin-optical frequency standard based on the NV defect center in diamond. Our analysis reveals that the diamond frequency standard can potentially yield a fully chip-integrable solid-state timekeeping platform whose performance rivals that of modern atomic clocks, both laboratory and chip scale. A proposed device is shown in Fig. 4 and contains a diamond chip grown with a dielectric cavity for lowering the optical pumping power requirements, PL collection with on-chip Si photodiodes, and planar microwave waveguides for addressing the NV transitions, all of which can be integrated within modern device fabrication. Such miniaturized clocks can easily be integrated into scientific and consumer electronics and could be used in harsh external environments. Devices benefiting include those for wireless communication and GPS navigation (with improved tolerance to jamming) [36]. In addition, the clock's center frequency of 2.870 GHz could enable a wide-bandwidth data rate in next-generation cellular communications (f 40 GHz).",
                "Due to the center's relatively long lifetime, high density of spins, and optical detection, we estimate a time stability exceeding \u03c3 y = 2 \u00d7 10 -12 \u03c4 -1/2 , rivaling that of the newest chip-scale Cs and Rb standards over short times: seconds to minutes. Many of the technological advances, such as surface emitting lasers and chip-scale detectors, are readily deployable to this system, with the added benefit that the atomic system resides within the diamond substrate. We anticipate the ability to greatly improve upon this frequency standard using repetitive readout [21], entanglement [37], IR absorption detection [38], and nanophotonics [39].",

Without loss of generality, we omitted the |-1 level, deviating from the full Hamiltonian in the main text. This can be rationalized in one of two ways: (i) the microwave excitations are circularly polarized, thus only the transitions |+1 are allowed by selection rules [41]; or (ii) a small bias magnetic field is applied to split the |\u00b11 degeneracy and under a rotating wave approximation with limited microwave excitation power the |-1 levels are far from resonance.
