    "abstract": "An object of the present invention is directed to a method for assaying the severity of an illness in real time and is to provide a testing method capable of assessing the severity of an illness in more detail than the conventional APACHE II and SOFA scores. The established method can accurately measure an ATP level in a sample, thereby accurately and quickly deducing the \u201cstate of intracellular energy required for living organisms\u201d from the ATP level, and by extension, determining the severity of an illness. The present invention further provides a novel biomarker ATP-lactate energy risk score (A-LES) value that is capable of determining the severity of an illness by the reevaluation, with the ATP concentration as an index (specifically, on the basis of a lactic acid level (mM)/ATP concentration (mM) ratio), of the level of lactic acid that accumulates in the sample due to the breakdown of in vivo metabolic balance accompanied by the increased severity of the illness. The present invention also provides a novel biomarker ATP-ketone energy risk score (A-KES) value that is capable of determining the severity of an illness by the reevaluation of a ketone body level in the sample with the ATP concentration as an index (specifically, on the basis of a ketone body level (mM)/ATP concentration (mM) ratio).",

                        "ATP is a chemical (nucleotide) that is used as energy required for all living organisms. For this reason, ATP assay has heretofore been used routinely for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of microbes contained in biological samples. Since ATP is mainly produced in intracellular organelle mitochondria, ATP has been assayed so far in order to determine mitochondrial functions. The conventional ATP assay techniques, however, have failed to efficiently extract ATP contained in biological samples. Due to such inaccurate information on the ATP concentrations in the biological samples, it has been difficult to accurately deduce the \u201cstate of intracellular energy required for living organisms\u201d from measured ATP levels by use of this numeric value.",
                        "The present inventors have established a revolutionary technique of very effectively extracting ATP from a sample and accurately measuring the ATP concentration in the cell or the tissue (patent document 1: WO2009/096429; Method for extraction of nucleotide). This method offers accurate information on ATP concentrations in biological samples.",
                        "Meanwhile, the APACHE II scoring system (non-patent document 1: Knaus W A, Draper E A, Wagner D P, and Zimmerman J E: A severity of disease classification system. Critical Care Medicine 13: 818-829, 1985) for severity in hospitalized patients has been adopted since its revision in 1985 down to this day as a conventional technique of determining the \u201cseverity of an illness\u201d. Since the APACHE II score does not reflect real-time scores, risk markers or evaluation methods have been demanded as a substitute for the score. The APACHE II scoring system involves acute physiological scores consisting of 12 variables: 1) deep body temperature, 2) mean arterial pressure, 3) heart rate, 4) respiratory rate, 5) oxygenation, 6) arterial pH, 7) serum Na concentration, 8) serum K concentration, 9) serum creatinine concentration, 10) hematocrit value, 11) leucocyte count, and 12) the Glasgow coma score, and conducts evaluation based on the total of these scores plus age point and chronic health problem point. Alternatively, the SOFA scoring system (non-patent document 2: Vincent J L, Moreno R, Takala J, Willatts S, De Mendonca A, Bruining H, Reinhart C K, Suter P M, and Thijs L G: The SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment) score to describe organ dysfunction/failure. On behalf of the Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Intensive Care Medicine 7: 707-710, 1996) has been proposed to determine the degree of failure in important organs. The SOFA score is calculated from the total of acute physiological scores: 1) respiratory function, 2) platelet count, 3) bilirubin level, 4) blood pressure, 5) the Glasgow Coma Scale, and 6) serum creatinine concentration or daily urine output. Unfortunately, these APACHE II and SOFA scores do not serve as real-time markers due to many variables to be measured and time-consuming procedures for rounding up evaluation results as in the measurement of daily urine output. Thus, the establishment of evaluation methods has been demanded as a substitute for these systems."

                        "In the testing method of the present invention, the phenol compound used in the step of extracting ATP contained in the sample is not particularly limited as long as the compound has a phenol group and is capable of extracting ATP from the sample. Phenol is particularly preferable. Also, the solution comprising a phenol compound may further comprise a protein denaturant. Any protein denaturant known in the art can be used as the protein denaturant. Particularly preferable examples thereof can include protein denaturants that may be used in conventional ATP extraction methods, for example, guanidine isocyanate, perchloric acid, TCA, and protein kinase K. In the case of a sample rich in proteins other than ATPase, the addition of the protein denaturant may denature and aggregate these proteins. In such a case, analyte nucleic acids such as ATP may get lost in the proteins thus aggregated by denaturation, making extraction difficult. This may interfere with accurate assay. Also, heat treatment used in the conventional ATP extraction methods may be used for sample treatment in combination with the method for extraction of nucleotide according to the present invention. In the case of a sample rich in proteins, however, nucleic acids may be incorporated in the proteins denatured by heating, as described above. Thus, in some cases, ATP can be extracted most efficiently by treatment with the solution comprising a phenol compound that is not combined with a protein denaturant or heat treatment.",
                        "The pH of the solution comprising a phenol compound is not particularly limited and is preferably set, for the most sensitive assay, to a pH at which a nucleic acid assay reagent such as a luciferase assay reagent can react most efficiently. In the case of sample treatment with the solution comprising a phenol compound, ATP is extracted more effectively than the conventional extraction methods even by treatment with a solution of any pH, for example, pH 4 to 10. For example, in ATP assay using a luciferase reagent, effective assay can be achieved around pH 7 to 9 according to the characteristics of luciferase. Accordingly, the pH of the solution comprising a phenol compound of the present invention is preferably set to around 7 to 9, more preferably around 8. The solution comprising a phenol compound used in the step of extracting ATP can be used as a reagent for ATP extraction from the sample.",
                        "The solvent for the phenol compound is not particularly limited, and, for example, TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA) can be used. A stabilizer may be further added thereto, if necessary. In the testing method of the present invention, the ATP level can be measured by a method appropriately selected according to an analyte of interest. Such a method can encompass methods known in the art as well as every measurement method that will be developed. The methods known in the art that can be applied to the present invention may be, for example, a method using luciferin-luciferase luminescence reaction or a method using ATP exchange reaction. Examples of the method for assaying ATP using luciferin-luciferase luminescence reaction include methods which involve contacting a luminescent reagent comprising luciferin and luciferase with target ATP in the presence of metal ions (e.g., magnesium ions) and measuring the intensity of the generated light. ATP can be assayed specifically and accurately using, for example, XL-ATP kit (manufactured by APRO Life Science Institute, Inc.) as a commercially available kit for ATP assay.",

As a result, ATP was found at a concentration of 0.52 to 1.3 mM in most of the healthy individuals. Also, the level of ATP in blood was confirmed not to significantly differ depending on sex (see FIG. 1). In the present invention, the normal value of the ATP level in the sample can be defined as 0.52 to 1.3 mM, more specifically 0.52 to 1.21 mM, with 0.72 mM as a median value.

By contrast, the APACHE II scores of severely ill patients who finally died as a result of exacerbation remained high or decreased in some cases, whereas their A-LES values exhibited the tendency to rise along with the exacerbation of the disease conditions and well reflected the degree of increased severity. As is evident from these results, the A-LES value can not only serve as a real-time marker to reflect disease conditions but evaluate the degree of increased severity in more detail even in patients having high APACHE II scores."

                                "In this Example, ATP levels, lactic acid levels, A-LES values, ketone body levels (3-hydroxybutyric acid levels), and A-KES values (3-hydroxybutyric acid level/ATP level) in an experimental system using severely ill mice infected with influenza virus was shown as an example in which ATP levels and A-LES values can be used preferably in severity evaluation even using non-human vertebrate (test animal)-derived blood. Only 3-hydroxybutyric acid levels, not acetoacetic acid levels, were measured as the ketone body levels due to limitations in the amount of mouse blood necessary for the measurement. For this reason, the A-KES values were determined and evaluated from the 3-hydroxybutyric acid level/ATP level. In the viral infection test, each 4-week-old wild-type mouse (C57BL/6) was transnasally infected with 120 PFU of influenza virus (Influenza A/PR/8/34: H1N1). On the other hand, saline was transnasally administered instead of the virus to healthy mice as controls. On the 7th day (immediately before some of these mice died), blood was collected, and ATP levels, lactic acid levels, A-LES values, ketone body levels (3-hydroxybutyric acid levels), and A-KES values (\u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid level/ATP level) were determined (FIG. 6).",
                                "The severely ill mice infected with influenza virus were confirmed to have decrease in ATP level and increase in lactic acid level, compared with the healthy mice. This showed a remarkable rise in A-LES value. These results demonstrated that the A-LES value was able to evaluate severity or therapeutic effects or the like even using samples from vertebrates (test animals) other than humans (test subjects). Since reference A-LES values for severity differ depending on animal species, the criteria in humans can be referred to but are not directly applied to the non-human animals. Also, the severely ill mice infected with influenza virus were confirmed to have decrease in ATP level and increase in ketone body level (3-hydroxybutyric acid level), compared with the healthy mice. This showed a remarkable rise in A-KES value (3-hydroxybutyric acid level/ATP level). This result demonstrated that the A-KES value also achieved evaluation of severity or therapeutic effects or the like. Since reference A-KES values for severity differ depending on the type of the ketone body level (e.g., the 3-hydroxybutyric acid level alone or the total of acetoacetic acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acid levels) or animal species.",
                                "As shown above, the blood ATP level was shown to reflect the \u201cstate of energy required for living\u201d and also shown to serve as a novel index to represent the severity of an illness in real time. Furthermore, the value of lactic acid in blood that usually increases, during muscle fatigue or impaired oxygen utilization of tissues, as an intermediate metabolite of energy metabolism can be reevaluated as an A-LES value with blood ATP as a denominator and thereby indicated as a sensitive \u201cenergy risk score\u201d, showing the severity of an illness. Particularly, the A-LES value sensitively represents the severity of illnesses such as energy metabolism-related diseases, for example, infectious diseases, diabetes mellitus, metabolic diseases (e.g., mitochondrial encephalomyopathy), peripheral circulation insufficiency, CO poisoning, deficiency of energy metabolic enzymes, but can serve as a real-time risk marker for the severity of illnesses other than these diseases. It was also shown that the A-KES value, which is the ratio of the ketone body level in blood to the ATP level in blood, can also be reevaluated, thereby determining the severity of an illness."
