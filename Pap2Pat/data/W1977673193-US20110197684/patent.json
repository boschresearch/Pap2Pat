    "date": "2011-04-27 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "An assembly of microcantilever-based sensors with enhanced deflections. A deflection profile of an \u03b5-assembly can be compared with that of a rectangular microcantilever and a modified triangular microcantilever. Various force-loading conditions can also be considered. A theorem of linear elasticity for thin beams is utilized to obtain the deflections. The obtained defections can be validated against an accurate numerical solution utilizing a finite element method with a maximum deviation of less than 10 percent. The \u03b5-assembly produces larger deflections than the rectangular microcantilever under the same base surface stress and same extension length. Also, the \u03b5-microcantilever assembly produces a larger deflection than a modified triangular microcantilever. The deflection enhancement increases as the \u03b5-assembly's free length decreases for various types of force loading conditions. The \u03b5-microcantilever can be utilized in microsensing applications to provide a favorable high detection capability with a reduced susceptibility to external noises.",

                        "The rapid growth of nanotechnology has led to developments of new sensing devices of micrometer size coined as microsensors. These devices can be used to detect, measure, analyze, and economically monitor low concentrations of chemical and biological agents. The monitoring of a specific substance is pivotal in many applications especially for clinical purposes. This is in order to screen a patient for the presence of a disease at an early stage. Microcantilevers based microsensors have been proven to be very sensitive and accurate. See Wu G, Ji H, Hansen K, Thundat T, Datar R, Cote R, Hagan M F, Chakraborty A K, and Majumdar A (2001) Origin of Nanomechanical cantilever motion generated from biomolecular interactions, PNAS, 98:1560-1564.",
                        "The changes in the physical properties of the microcantilever are considered to indicate or detect changes in the environment surrounding it. The most often considered physical property is the deflection. The deflection of the microcantilever was first used for atomic force microscopy. However, it is mainly used to indicate the presence or absence of a certain analyte. See Alkamine S, Barrett R. C., and Quate C. F. (1990) Improved atomic force microscope images using microcantilevers with sharp tips, Appl. Phys. Lett., 57:316 and Raiteri R, Nelles G, Butt H-J, Knoll W, and Skladal P (1999) Sensing of biological substances based on the bending of the microfabricated cantilevers, Sens. Actuators B, 61:213-217.",
                        "The magnitude of microcantilever deflection is of the order of nanometers and it is usually measured using an optical method. The noise level in the surrounding environment affects the performance of the microcantilever as a sensing device. For example, Raiteri R, Nelles G, Butt H-J, Knoll W, and Skladal P (1999), Sensing of biological substances based on the bending of the microfabricated cantilevers, Sens. Actuators B, 61:213-217 reported that the microcantilever deflection due to flow disturbances and due to thermal effects could reach 5-10 times that due to analyte sensing. Accordingly, further developments in microcantilever technology is necessary in order to magnify the deflection signal due to the sensing effect so that its signal can be easily distinguished from the noise signal.

Actuators B, 94:103-115, pointed out the necessity of establishing special microcantilevers assemblies for this purpose."

                                "Note that present analytical methods were tested against an accurate numerical solution using finite element methods and accounting for all mechanical constraints induced by the assemblies. Among these constraints is restraining the wrapping of the side beams due to the presence of the small connecting beam at x=L. The deflection contours for assembly (c) with L=385 \u03bcm, W=30 \u03bcm and t=20 nm under concentrated moment condition described in section 2.2.II with M=10\u221212 N\u03bcm is shown in FIG. 4. The microcantilever material was taken to be silicon with E=0.185 N\u03bcm\u22122 and a poisons ratio of v=0.33. The assembly deflection at x=L is equal to zcM(\u03c7=L)=0.028 \u03bcm using Equation (36)(b). Also, the deflection at the intermediate beam's free end can be shown to be equal to zcIBM(\u03c7=0)=0.048 \u03bcm.",
                                "As can be seen from FIG. 4, the corresponding numerical values of those deflections are equal to 0.026 \u03bcm and 0.045 \u03bcm, respectively. Notice that the maximum error between the numerical and the derived analytical solutions is less than 10 percent. Also, notice that the numerical values of deflections are smaller than those predicated by the analytical methods. This is because the geometrical constraints imposed on the assemblies impede the deflections.",
                                "FIG. 5 illustrates a graph 50 depicting plotted data indicative of the variation of the performance indicators \u03b3bF and \u03b3cF with the relative dimensions of assemblies 12 and 13. It is noticed that all the values of \u03b3bF and \u03b3cF are larger than one which indicates that assemblies 12 and 13 produce larger deflections than rectangular microcantilevers under same surface stress at the base and same length L. Moreover, both indicators increase as both the microcantilever width W and the assembly width B increase. Similar findings are noticed for the performance indicators \u03b3bM, \u03b3cM, \u03b3b\u0394\u03c3, and \u03b3c\u0394\u03c3 as can be seen from graphs 60 and 70 shown respectively FIGS. 6 and 7. On the other hand, an increase in B causes the effective free length of the assembly to increase, which makes the assembly more pronounced to external noises.",
                                "FIG. 8 illustrates a graph 80 depicting data indicative of the variation of the second performance indicator \u03bbcF with the relative dimensions of the epsilon shaped microcantilever assembly 13. It is noticed that all values of \u03bbcF are smaller than minus one. This indicates that IB-free end deflection is always larger than that of the assembly tip deflection. Moreover, the absolute value of \u03bbcF is noticed to increases as both W and B decreases. Similar findings are noticed for the performance indicators \u03bbcM and \u03bbc\u0394\u03c3 as can be seen from graphs 90 and 100 depicted respectively in FIGS. 9 and 10. As a result, the epsilon shaped microcantilever assembly 13 can provide larger deflections than the modified triangular microcantilever assembly 12, while it is less affected by external noise. This is because its deflection increases as B decreases, which results in a reduction of the assembly's free length. Moreover, the absolute values of \u03bbc\u0394\u03c3 increases as n increases as can be shown using Equation 234. This indicates the advantage of assembly 13 in microsensing applications as compared to rectangular cantilevers or triangular cantilevers.",
                                "Advantages of utilizing microcantilever assemblies including the \u03b5-assembly in microsensing applications have been explored, as discussed herein. Various force loadings conditions that can produce noticeable deflections such as the concentrated force, moment and constant surface stress, which can be due to analyte adhesion, are considered. The linear elasticity theory for thin beams is used to obtain the deflections. Different deflection indicators are defined and various controlling variables are identified. The performance of different microcantilever assemblies is compared with the performance of rectangular microcantilevers in order to map out conditions that produce magnification of the sensing deflection relative to the noise deflection.",
