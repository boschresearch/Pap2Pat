    "title": "P2X7 Inhibition Of Epithelial Cancers And Papillomas",
    "date": "2009-09-04 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention demonstrates that P2X7 receptor induced apoptosis may be specific for cancerous cells. Treatment with the P2X7 ligand BzATP, increased cellular apoptosis with no associated inflammatory changes or abnormal skin or systemic effects. In mice treated with DMBA/TPA, BzATP decreased papilloma skin formation. BzATP also induced involution of developed papillomas and stimulated apoptosis in keratinocytes outgrowing at the base of developed papillomas. These data show that (a) P2X7 regulates apoptosis of epidermal cells; (b) in vivo, local administration of a drug that activates the P2X7 receptor can inhibit development and progression of epidermal premalignant lesions.",

As such, each causative factor can, and does, result in a different type of cancer that usually manifests in a different biological tissue. As a result, no one therapeutic approach has been identified that has been effective at slowing or preventing the progression of a large percentage of different cancerous types. The only commonality that is currently recognized between all cancer diseases is manifested by an uncontrolled cellular growth rate.",

In some circumstances, cancer cells will be in the form of a tumor; such cells may exist locally within an animal, or circulate in the blood stream as independent cells, for example, leukemia cells. The number of cancer cells in a subject's body can be determined by direct measurement, or by estimation from the size of primary or metastatic tumor masses. For example, the number of cancer cells in a subject can be measured by immunohistological methods, flow cytometry, or other techniques designed to detect characteristic surface markers of cancer cells.",

Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation can be inferred if the number of cancer cells in a subject remains constant or decreases after administration of a miRNA gene product and/or an miRNA gene expression-inhibiting compound. An inhibition of cancer cell proliferation can also be inferred if the absolute number of such cells increases, but the rate of tumor growth decreases.",

Cancer is believed to be a disease of overproliferation, wherein the present invention provides a method to reduce this overproliferation. For example, the methods herein result in the induction of intracellular apoptosis, thereby resulting in the prevention of cancerous growth and/or a reduction in cancer tumor size and number. The administration of a specific membrane receptor agonist (i.e., for example, a P2X7 receptor agonist) is shown herein to reduce cancer growth and progression.",

Cancerous cells are also called malignant cells and are derived from normal cells in the body. Cancer appears to occur when the growth of cells in the body is out of control and cells divide too quickly. It can also occur when cells \u201cforget\u201d how to die (i.e., for example, reduced apoptosis). There are many different kinds of cancers. Cancer can develop in almost any organ or tissue, including, but not limited to, the lung, colon, breast, skin, bones, or nerve tissue.",

However, the cause of many cancers remains unknown. The most common cancers in men in the United States include, but are not limited to skin cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer. In women in the U.S., the most common cancers include, but are not limited to, breast cancer, skin cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer.",

Symptoms of cancer depend on the type and location of the tumor. For example, lung cancer can cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Colon cancer often causes diarrhea, constipation, and blood in the stool. Some cancers may not have any symptoms at all. In certain cancers, such as gallbladder cancer, symptoms often do not start until the disease has reached an advanced stage. The following symptoms can occur with most cancers: chills, fatigue, fever, loss of appetite, malaise, night sweats, or weight loss.",

The stage of a cancer refers to how much it has grown and whether the tumor has spread from its original location. If the cancer is confined to one location and has not spread, current treatments are oriented towards surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.

                                "The current theory of epithelial cell growth predicts regulation by the concerted actions of mitogenic stimuli and apoptosis [1,2]. Apoptosis is a homeostatic process orchestrated by the host's genome of selective cell deletion without stimulating inflammatory response [3-5]. Earlier studies showed that apoptosis is activated in response to noxious stimuli e.g. starvation, inflammation, infection, irradiation, etc. More recent data suggested a physiological role for apoptosis, including the control of tissue development and differentiation, regulation of mitogenic effects, and control of cell death and loss of tissue with aging, and dysregulation of apoptotic cell-death has been implicated in states of disease [6].",
                                "Apoptosis is believed to be a process of programmed cell death that may occur in multicellular organisms. Programmed cell death involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death, in more specific terms, a series of biochemical events that lead to a variety of morphological changes, including blebbing, changes to the cell membrane such as loss of membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Processes of disposal of cellular debris whose results do not damage the organism differentiate apoptosis from necrosis.",
                                "In contrast to necrosis, which is a form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury, apoptosis, in general, confers advantages during an organism's life cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. Between 50 billion and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 billion to 30 billion cells die a day. In a year, this amounts to the proliferation and subsequent destruction of a mass of cells equal to an individual's body weight. Excessive apoptosis causes hypotrophy, such as in ischemic damage, whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as cancer.",
                                "Apoptosis may occur when a cell is damaged beyond repair, infected with a virus, or undergoing stressful conditions such as starvation. Damage to DNA from ionizing radiation or toxic chemicals can also induce apoptosis via the actions of the tumour-suppressing gene p53. The \u201cdecision\u201d for apoptosis can come from the cell itself, from the surrounding tissue, or from a cell that is part of the immune system. In these cases, apoptosis functions to remove the damaged cell, preventing it from sapping further nutrients from the organism, or halting further spread of viral infection.",
                                "As discussed further below, apoptosis may also play a role in preventing cancer. If a cell is unable to undergo apoptosis because of mutation or biochemical inhibition, it continues to divide and may develop into a tumor. For example, infection by papillomaviruses causes a viral gene to interfere with the cell's p53 protein, an important member of the apoptotic pathway. This interference in the apoptotic capability of the cell plays a role in the development of cervical cancer.",
                                "In an adult organism, the number of cells is kept relatively constant through cell death and division (i.e., proliferation). Cells must be replaced when they malfunction or become diseased, but proliferation must be offset by cell death. This control mechanism is part of the homeostasis required by living organisms to maintain their internal states within certain limits. Homeostasis is achieved when the rate of mitosis (cell division) in the tissue is balanced by cell death. If this equilibrium is disturbed, one of two potentially fatal disorders may occur: i) the cells are dividing faster than they die, effectively developing a tumor; or ii) the cells are dividing slower than they die, causing cell loss.",
                                "Homeostasis involves a complex series of reactions, an ongoing process inside an organism that calls for different types of cell signaling. Any impairment can cause a disease. For example, dysregulation of signaling pathway has been implicated in several forms of cancer. The pathway, which conveys an anti-apoptotic signal, has been found to be activated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues.",
                                "A. Mechanisms of Apoptosis",
                                "Histologically, apoptosis may be characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, cell detachment from the extracellular matrix, cell rounding and shrinking, and alterations in plasma membrane lipid organization. Usually, the final stages of apoptosis are induced by a series of proteolytic enzymes termed caspases, which cleave and activate each other in a cascade of proteolysis [14], terminating with the effector caspases 7 and 3 [15].",
                                "Several cellular pathways are involved in the activation of the caspase family of proteases and the induction of apoptosis. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method wherein apoptosis may involve pathways including, but not limited to: a) the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway; or b) the extrinsic death-receptor pathway. [16]",
                                "Apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway is characterized predominantly by mitochondrial changes. Effects are triggered by stimuli that cause mitochondrial disturbances and DNA damage (such as cancer therapeutic agents and ionizing irradiation), oxidative stress, hypoxia, cell detachment, and cellular distress [17]. Signals from these diverse stimuli converge upon the mitochondria, where propagation of the apoptotic signal is regulated by proteins that either promote (e.g. Bax, Bak, Bok, Bad, Bid, Bik, Bim, Bcl-Xs, Krk, Mtd, Nip3, Nix, Noxa, and Bcl-B) or suppress apoptosis (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bfl-1/Al, Bcl-W, and Bcl-G) [18,19]. Pro-apoptotic signals trigger permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, and facilitate the release of proteins from the mitochondrial intermembranous space into the cytoplasm, including cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo. The released cytochrome c then binds the caspase adaptor apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), thereby activating procaspase 9 and forming the apoptosome complex [20]. The apoptosome activates several downstream effector caspases, such as caspases 6, 7 and 3, leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death [21,22]. The effects of pro-apoptotic signals can be modulated by inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), e.g. c-IAP1, c-IAP2, NAIP, Survivin, XIAP, Bruce, ILP-2, and Livin [23]. IAPs directly inhibit caspases and/or catalyze their ubiquitination and proteaseome-mediated degradation. This balance is finely regulated by endogenous inhibitors of IAPs, such as SMAC and HtrA2, which compete with active caspases to bind to IAP [24]. Anti-apoptotic signals such as Bcl-XL can bind and inactivate Apaf-1, and stimulate the release of Smac/DIABLO proteins from the mitochondria, thereby inactivating the IAPs [25].",
                                "The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is a mechanism by which cells of the immune system trigger apoptosis in \u2018unhealthy\u2019 cells through ligand-mediated activation of cell surface death-mediating receptors, such as TNF Receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNF Receptor 2 (TNFR2), CD95/Fas/Apo1, and Death Receptors (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL]-TRAIL receptors) 3-6 (DR3-6) [15,17].",
                                "Binding of these receptors by their respective ligands leads to receptor oligomerization and recruitment of death signal adaptor proteins. For example, binding of Fas ligand (Fas-L) to Fas, or TRAIL to TRAIL-R1 [26] leads to recruitment of FADD (Fas-associated death domain), and binding of TNF to TNFR1 leads to recruitment of TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain) [22]. The oligomerized receptors and recruited FADD or TRADD form a complex termed DISC (death-inducing signaling complex), which can bind to initiator caspases (caspase 8 and 10), followed by triggering the activation of caspases 7 and 3, and leading to apoptosis [13,15].",
                                "Recent studies underscore deficiencies in the arbitrary classification of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. First, some signals can activate both pathways, and an extensive crosstalk exists between these two apoptosis pathways. For instance, the transcription factor NF-k\u03b2 can activate the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as FLIP, Bcl-XL, XIAP and cIAP1; however, NF-k\u03b2 can also enhance the expression of apoptosis-inducing genes such as Fas, Fas-L, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 [27].",
                                "Recent data has further suggested that the extrinsic death-receptor pathway is not limited to cells of the immune system, and that growth control of \u2018unhealthy\u2019 cells operates in most/all tissues containing proliferating cells. Thus, the P2X7 receptor mechanism controls growth of certain types of epithelial cells, under normal physiological conditions, and, as contemplated herein, impaired P2X7-mediated apoptosis could contribute to the neoplastic transformation in those tissues. Those discoveries suggest a physiological role for apoptosis in maintaining cellular homeostasis.",
                                "The improved understanding of apoptosis has provided a basis for targeted therapies that can induce death of cancer cells or sensitize them to established cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy [24,28,29]. Previous reports outlined agents and methods that suggest selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells might be potentially useful in cancer therapy [reviewed in 13,24,25,30-32]. Such apopotic mechanisms include, but are not limited to, i) activation of the cell surface death receptors Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors; ii) inhibition of cell survival signaling via EGFR, MAPK and PI3K; iii) altering the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family; iv) down-regulating anti-apoptosis proteins such as XIAP, surviving and c-IAP2; e) proteasome inhibitors; f) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors; g) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligands; or h) DNA methylation.",
                                "Despite the expanse of present research, however, only a small number of therapies directly targeting the apoptotic pathways have advanced into clinical testing, and none have yet achieved approval by the United States Food And Drug Administration. Of the clinical trials that were initiated using agents such as those listed above, many were of limited value because of problems including, but not limited to: i) low efficacy [33]; ii) toxicity [34]; iii) presence of decoy receptors (DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegerin) which bind TRAIL and inhibit apoptosis [35]; iv) concerns of inducing immunodeficiency with hypogammaglobulinemia; or v) predisposition to develop lymphomas [36].",

                                "Defective apoptosis may play a role in the development of cancers [7-9]. In fact, one of the hallmarks of cancer is the development of mechanisms that evade apoptosis, and the loss of pro-apoptotic signals and gain of anti-apoptotic mechanisms contribute to tumorigenesis and the cancer phenotype. Thus, defective apoptotic mechanisms allow genetically unstable cancer cells to avoid elimination and confer resistance to cancer treatments [10-11]. Since apoptosis does not elicit inflammatory or immune response, this type of cell death is the preferred way of cancer cell killing by various treatments. The selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for many cancers [13], and modulating the apoptotic pathways may be involved in mechanisms including, but not limited to, i) inducing tumor-cell death; ii) increasing responses to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other targeted therapies; or iii) prevention of the neoplastic transformation.",
                                "Levels of the functional P2X7 receptor in cancer epithelial cells of the ectoderm, the uro-genital sinus, and the distal paramesonephric duct are reported to be lower compared to normal cells (infra). The lesser expression of the P2X7-receptor could be the result of the neoplastic transformation. Thus, in endometrial and bladder cells low expression of the P2X7 receptor was found already in pre-cancerous and early cancerous cells, but not in hyperplastic benign cells [39,82,104]. As the data presented herein demonstrates, the carcinogenic process could have induced reduced expression of the P2X7 at early stages of cancer development. Alternatively, the neoplastic transformation could have been triggered preferentially in cells expressing low levels of the receptor. This possibility is supported by data in uterine cervical epithelia, where low expression of the P2X7 receptor was found already in dysplastic (precancerous) cells [39,82,104]. Few cases of dysplasia progress to cancer [109], so it is possible that low expression of the receptor preceded the neoplastic transformation. Accordingly, cells harboring defective P2X7 expression mechanism have escaped apoptosis, and were rendered susceptible to carcinogenic stimuli and the neoplastic transformation.",
                                "In both scenarios, low expression of the P2X7 receptor could promote cancer development, because decreased apoptosis due to reduced receptor expression can facilitate the growth of neoplastic cells. A recent study tested the hypothesis that in tissues at risk for undergoing malignant transformation augmentation of P2X7-mediated apoptosis could inhibit cancer development [55]."

Georgiou et al. 2005; Mutini et al, 1999. Overexpression of P2X7 was found in lesional skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, where an intense P2X7 immunoreactivity was confined to the cell membrane of the basal layer. Pastore et al, 2007.

For example, no previous studies have investigated experimentally the biological role of the P2X7 receptor in vivo. The data presented herein demonstrates that P2X7 receptors have an in vivo physiological role in the control of growth of epidermal epithelial cells. The data also suggest that this growth control may occur through apoptotic mechanisms, and that pharmacological stimulation of the receptor could inhibit development of epidermal neoplasia. For example, the presented data collected in cultured human normal keratinocytes and/or cancer keratinocytes provide direct evidence that P2X7 receptors control the growth of cells through regulation of apoptosis.

See, FIG. 21E. [38,40-42,49,55]. In its maximal size, the pore is relatively permeable to Ca2+, but it remains selective to other cations and is impermeable to anions [49]. P2X7 pore formation involves recruitment to the plasma membrane of receptor molecules [67-69] and pannexins [70,71], and the formation of complexes composed of receptor tri-oligomers. See, FIG. 21D.

This question could be answered by reference to the biological role of the receptor. In epithelial cells, the P2X7 receptor controls the growth of cells through the induction of apoptosis [38]. A high affinity of the P2X7 receptor for its natural ligand ATP would be disadvantageous to normal cells because the receptor would be activated continuously and induce cell death. Cells have apparently devised mechanisms to regulate expression and activity of the P2X7 receptor, and the low affinity of the receptor could be an additional physiologic mechanism to control receptor activation and to avoid cell death. See, FIG. 22. Under normal conditions, the extracellular levels of ATP are in the range that corresponds to the threshold level for receptor activation [38,40,42,49,55]. Accordingly, only a fraction of the receptor pool would be activated, and only few cells are likely to undergo apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by the mouse data in vivo that in the normal skin the degree of baseline apoptosis in P2X7-receptor-expressing keratinocytes is low. See, FIGS. 26C and 26L, [55].",

Co-localization in the plasma membrane reflects foremost the full-length active receptor [42,50], although truncated forms (e.g. the P2X7-j protein) can be also sorted to the plasma membrane [50]. P2X7 immunoreactivity found in the cytoplasm reflects newly formed receptor en route to be inserted into the plasma membrane, or post-activation internalized, degraded, or recycled receptor [50].

Correlative data suggest that these regions contain binding sites for transcription factors p300, Elk-1, E47, EIIaE, E2F, and p53 [44], which can integrate signals from enhancer and promoter regions and regulate cell growth and apoptosis [83-90]. The repression or absence of some of these transcription factors, e.g. E47 [85] and p53 [90], have been implicated in cancer development. The tumor suppressor p53 controls expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and cell death [90], and P2X7 expression correlates with p53 protein levels [91], and with activation of the p53 apoptotic pathway [92].",

Conversely, treatment of cells with de-methylation drugs, e.g. 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) upregulates P2X7 mRNA, possibly by inducing de-methylation of cytosines at the CpG sites +211/+212 +330/+331 and +461/+464 [44]. The molecular mechanism by which hypermethylated CpGs downstream of the P2X7 promoter inhibit transcription possibly involves modulation of the spatial conformation of transcription factors recognition sites within the putative enhancers regions [44].",

Glycosylation facilitates Golgi transport, trafficking, and insertion of the receptor into the plasma membrane, while receptor de-glycosylation abrogates receptor function [41]. Glycosylation of the P2X7 receptor is controlled by (\u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22-AR)\u2014activation of protein kinase-A (PKA), resulting in de-glycosylation of the P2X7 receptor and enhanced receptor degradation [41]. The PKA effect is regulated by the action of the epidermal growth factor (EGF); it involves facilitated, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent inhibition of \u03b22-AR internalization, and facilitated \u03b22-AR recycling, thereby increasing the pool of \u03b22-ARs in the plasma membrane that are available for activation upon ligand binding.

[47-50]. Oligomerization of the P2X7 receptor depends on the availability of P2X7 monomers, and is influenced by the presence of truncated forms of the P2X7 that can hetero-oligomerize with the full-length P2X7 form and produce non-functional pores [50]. Five truncated variants of the human P2X7 were previously reported (P2X7-b, P2X7-c, P2X7-g, P2X7-I, and P2X7-j), resulting from alternative splicing [50,54,96]. All lack the carboxy terminus of the wild-type P2X7 receptor, and some (P2X7-b and P2X7-j) have been shown to be ineffective in pore formation and apoptosis induction when expressed singularly in host cells [50].",
                                "The P2X7-j form is expressed naturally in normal and in cancer epithelial cells [50]. It is composed of the proximal 248 amino-acids of the wild-type P2X7 with an altered stretch of 10 amino-acids at its carboxy terminus. It lacks the distal 337 amino-acids of the P2X7, including the entire intracellular carboxy terminus, the second transmembrane domain, and the distal third of the extracellular loop. When expressed heterologously, treatment with the P2X7-specific ligand BzATP evokes minor channel activity but it fails to induce pore formation and apoptosis [50]. Co-expression in host cells of the P2X7-j plus the full-length P2X7 results in hetero-oligomerization between the P2X7-j and the P2X7, and the formation of nonfunctional P2X7-j/P2X7 hetero-oligomers [50].",

The data suggest that in cells expressing both receptor forms, abundance of the P2X7-j or paucity of the full-length P2X7 receptor will increase the likelihood of formation of nonfunctional pores, and will tend to abrogate the induction of apoptosis.

                                "In estrogen-responsive tissues, exposure to estrogen induces growth-promoting effects on cells. In the past it was believed that most of the effect involves activation of estrogen-dependent mitogenic stimuli. However, recent data show that some of the effect is the result of estrogen induced anti apoptotic effect. Experiments using human normal and cancerous estrogen-responsive uterine epithelial cells showed that estrogen inhibits baseline apoptosis (mediated primarily by the P2X7-receptor [38]), as well as P2X7-augmented apoptosis [40]. In these cells, the P2X7-mediated apoptosis involves influx of Ca2+ via P2X7-pores and induction of apoptosis by the mitochondrial-caspase-9 pathway [38, 40-42]. Treatment with estrogen blocks P2X7-receptor-induced activation of caspase 9, but the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition differs in normal and in cancer cells. In the normal cells, treatment with estrogen results in lower cytosolic calcium by attenuation of P2X7-induced calcium-influx. In contrast, estrogen up-regulates activity of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 in cancer cells [40].",

At the tissue/organ level the P2X7 is involved in the innate immune response against microbial infections. Ligation of P2X7 by ATP can stimulate inflammasome activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 [e.g. 63, 97, 98], and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In macrophages, P2X7 stimulates ROS production through the MAPKs ERK1/2 and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex [99]. P2X7 effects also regulate the function of the nervous [100], skeletal [101], and epithelial systems [102]. At the cellular level, non-apoptotic effects of P2X7 receptor activation involve membrane responses, and alter profiles of cell surface lipid and protein composition that modulate the direct interactions of P2X7-receptor-expressing cells with other cell types. The responses can also induce the release of bioactive proteins, lipids, and large membrane complexes into extracellular compartments for remote communication between P2X7-receptor-expressing cells and other cells that amplify or modulate inflammation, immunity, and responses to tissue damage [103].",
                                "However, the hallmark of P2X7 receptor activation is induction/augmentation of cell death. Early studies reported on the cytolytic effects of P2X7 receptor activation in cells of the white lineage. Recent studies focused on the pro-apoptotic effects of P2X7 receptor activation in epithelial cells.",

In stratified epithelia, e.g. the uterine ectocervix [39,82] or the epidermis [55,76,105], cells proliferate from reserve cells that reside in the basal/parabasal layers. These cells rest on the basal membrane and continue to divide throughout life. In the skin, a large pool of reserve cells can be also found within hair shafts [105]. Superficial to the parabasal layer are layers of metabolically active cells (intermediate in the cervix, granular in the skin), and layers of cells undergoing terminal differentiation (superficial cells in the cervix, transitional cells in the skin). The skin, in contrast to non-keratinizing stratified epithelia (e.g. the cervix) also contains the superficial stratum corneum, composed of layer(s) of flat dead cells [105].",
                                "In normal stratifying epithelia, P2X7 immunoreactivity is intense in basal/parabasal layers (and in hair shafts in the skin); lesser in the intermediate ectocervical layers of the epithelium and in the epidermal granular layers; and more intense in the superficial (ectocervix), and transitional and stratum corneum layers (skin) [39,76,82,104]. In contrast to the P2X7 receptor protein, P2X7 mRNA is found mainly in the basal/parabasal layers, but not in the more superficial layers [39]. Thus, the P2X7 immunoreactivity in non-proliferating layers represents receptor trapped in dying cells that undergo terminal differentiation, and most likely it mediates the apoptosis that is associated with the terminal differentiation [105]. However, this function is secondary to its main role, which is regulation of growth of the proliferating reserve cells. Reserve cells are the target of carcinogenic stimuli and are at risk of undergoing neoplastic transformation; the intense expression of de-novo synthesized receptor in these cells suggests that the P2X7 receptor controls directly the growth of the reserve cells [55].",

                                "While P2X7 receptor activation may augment apoptosis in both normal and cancer epithelial cells, some types of cancerous epithelial cells have a decreased apoptotic effect than in the respective normal cells. For instance, treatment with the P2X7 receptor specific agonist BzATP of cancer ectocervical, endocervical, endometrial cells and cancer keratinocytes resulted in 2-5 fold lesser apoptosis than in the respective normal cells [38,40,55]. Baseline apoptosis, which in those cells is determined mainly by the P2X7 system [38,40,55], was also smaller in the cancer cells than in the normal cells [38,40,55]. Recent data indicate that the attenuated P2X7-mediated apoptosis in the cancer cells is due mainly to reduced cellular levels of the P2X7 receptor (mRNA and protein) in the cancer cells [41,42,44,50,55,94].",
                                "Differences in P2X7 receptor expression in cancer versus normal epithelial cells were described [82]. Recent studies using well-characterized immune methods to detect the functional full-length P2X7 receptor reported that epithelia can be grouped relative to P2X7 receptor expression as follows:\n\n\n- - a) Epithelia with similar trend of expression in normal and cancer\n    cells, e.g. the colon \\[82\\].\n  - b) Epithelia with higher expression of the P2X\u2087 in cancer cells than\n    in normal cells, e.g. thyroid \\[82,106\\].\n  - c) Epithelia with lesser expression of the P2X\u2087 in cancer cells than\n    in normal cells. These include epithelia derived from the ectoderm\n    (skin and breast), the uro-genital sinus (bladder and ectocervix),\n    and the distal paramesonephric (M\u00fcllerian) duct (endocervix and\n    endometrium) \\[39,50,55,76,82,104\\]. In those tissues P2X\u2087\n    expression is decreased already in early phases of the neoplasia.",
                                "Thus, early embryonic events may imprint the type of P2X7 regulation of expression in later stages of life.",
                                "P2X7 polymorphisms have been described and point-mutations have been identified in lymphocytes and monocytes, causing either loss-of-function, e.g. 1513A>C (E496A), 1729T>A (1568N), 946G>A (R307Q), 1068G>A (A348T), 1096C>G (T357S), and 1405A>G (Q460R); or gain of function, e.g. 489C>T (H155Y). A 1352T>C(P451L) change impairs cell death in murine thymocytes. Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the P2X7 receptor has also been reported, and one variant was associated with protection against tuberculosis. Additional P2X7 gene variants were included in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Consortium database, but their functional implications remain to be determined [50]. Numerous point-mutations were found in cancer epithelial cells, [data not shown], but there is no evidence that genetic mutations of P2X7 influence the development of cancer in these tissues.",

                                "Hypermethylation of genes can induce repression of tumor suppressor genes and lead to cancer development [107]. In uterine cervical cells CpG sites +193/+194 (and/or +211/+212), +330/+331, and +461/+462 (and/or +463+464), in regions that co-localize with enhancers' sites, are direction-dependent inhibitory cis elements of P2X7 transcription [44]. Data in cultured cervical cells and in cervix epithelial tissues in vivo showed that cytosines within these CpG sites are hypermethylated in the cancer cells [44]. Moreover, the hypermethylation of cytosines in CpG sites downstream of the P2X7 promoter correlated with reduced expression of P2X7 mRNA and protein in the cancer cervical cells [44], suggesting that decreased transcription of P2X7 through hypermethylation of cis-regulatory elements plays a role in cancer development.",

                                "Low steady state levels of P2X7 in cancer epithelial cells can be the result of enhanced degradation of the transcript through the action of micro-RNAs [94] miRNAs reside in genomic regions that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, and abnormally expressed miRNAs in human cancers can modulate the stability of transcripts of protein-coding genes involved in tumorigenesis or apoptosis [94]. Sequences within the human 3\u2032UTR-P2X7 express target sites for miR-186 and miR-150 that confer instability to the P2X7 transcript [94]. Cancer epithelial cells express higher levels of micro-RNAs miR-186 and miR-150 than normal cells [94], and the increased expression of miR-186 and miR-150 stimulates degradation of the P2X7 transcript preferentially in cancer cells.",
                                "Glycosylation",
                                "Glycosylation of the P2X7 receptor is important for receptor function. In epithelial cells glycosylation of the P2X7 receptor is controlled by the EGFR/PI3K/\u03b22-AR/PKA systems, and activation of PKA by the \u03b22-AR mechanism induces de-glycosylation of the P2X7 receptor [41]. The \u03b22-AR effect is facilitated by co-activation of the EGFR. which is often overexpressed in cancer epithelial cells. See, FIGS. 21D and 22, [41] and [108], respectively. Therefore, overexpression of the EGFR could contribute to neoplasia by two groups of mechanisms: via its pro-mitogenic influence; and by abrogation of P2X7-mediated apoptosis (reduced expression of the P2X7 receptor through PKA-mediated de-glycosylation of the receptor).",

                                "Nine splice variants of the human P2X7 resulting from alternative splicing were previously reported, of which the P2X7-j is the most prevalent in epithelial cells. The P2X7-j can hetero-oligomerize with the full-length receptor, and lead to the formation of inactive complexes. In contrast to the full length P2X7, which is reduced in some types of cancer cells, the expression of the P2X7-j in those cells is relatively stable. This imbalance would favor the formation of inactive P2X7-j/P2X7 hetero-oligomers leading to defective apoptosis and augmented growth of the cancer cells. See, FIG. 21E, [50]."

                                "Some reports suggest that pro-apoptotic activity mediated by the P2X7 receptor could be potentially used as a cancer treatment and cancer prevention in humans [110]. Until the present invention, however, the development of such an anti-neoplastic modality was not clinically relevant because target tissue specificity and an understanding of the pharmacological properties of an effective therapeutic was not understood.",
                                "It is currently believed that a P2X7 receptor is member of the family of ATP-dependent P2 nucleotide purinergic receptors. Early data on the anti-neoplastic properties of P2 receptors agonists prompted in vivo studies using systemic or intraperitoneal treatments with ATP, the natural ligand of P2 receptors. [111]",
                                "Cancer treatments using intravenous infusions of ATP in patients with advanced cancers have been reported. For example, a randomized clinical trial in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has shown beneficial effects of ATP treatment on fatigue, appetite, body weight, muscle strength, functional status, quality of life, and serum albumin concentrations, with marked effects in cachectic patients [112]. ATP treatment was associated with increased survival in the subgroup of weight-losing patients (9.3 months in ATP-treated patients versus 3.5 months in control patients); however, ATP had no effect on tumor stage and survival within the entire study group [113]. The data suggested that the beneficial effects of ATP on body fat, fat-free and body cell mass, and on energy intake were due to the maintenance of energy intake by restoration of hepatic energy levels. [114, [115], respectively.",
                                "Although the above studies suggest that palliative care of terminally ill cancer patients might be useful using intravenous ATP, it is evident in retrospect that the use of systemic ATP as an-anti cancer modality was likely to fail. Systemic administration of ATP will target P2 receptors throughout the body. Cells express more than one type of P2 receptors, and responses to ATP depend on the type of P2 receptors that are activated. Also, depending on cell type, activation of some receptor subtypes (i.e., for example, P2Y1, P2X5, and P2X7) leads to a decrease in cell number, whereas activation of other receptor subtypes (i.e., for example, P2Y2) can lead to an increase in cell number [116]. In addition, in some cell types e.g. peripheral T lymphocytes, activation of the P2X7 receptor can produce mitogenic response [117].",
                                "ATP instability is another factor that could negatively affect ATP's efficacy such as by ectoATPase degradation in extracellular fluids [118]. For example, anti-cachectic effects could have occurred by a breakdown product of ATP, adenosine, which is effective at reducing weight loss [119]. Ecto-ATPases are known in the plasma and extracellular fluids [61]. Further, it is unlikely that ATP reached a concentration range that is required for pharmacological activation of the P2X7 receptor [38,40,42,55].",
                                "Thus, the lack of tissue specificity and the poor understanding of ATP pharmacology following the systemic administration of ATP at the time of these studies provide a rationale for their clinical failure.",
                                "Recent studies have examined the effects of intraperitoneal administration of ATP on tumors resulting from implanted prostate and bladder carcinomas cells in nude mice [120], [121], respectively. The data showed a 44-69% reduction in the growth of freshly implanted cancer cells, with no adverse effects on the host mice. The growth reduction of the implanted bladder and prostate cancers provides proof-of-concept for the anti-neoplastic effect of ATP. [119]. Based on these considerations, the art suggests that the use of ATP as an anti-neoplastic modality could produce non-specific responses, and that ATP should not be used as an anti-neoplastic treatment modality in humans. Instead, one should focus on the use of P2 receptor modulators (i.e., for example, agonists or antagonists) that are selective for mediating the growth of cancer cells [116].",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a composition comprising BzATP as one such ATP agonist. BzATP was used to activate P2X7-mediated apoptosis and modulate growth of epidermal neoplasia. [55} BzATP was synthesized and used initially as a photoactivatable, covalently binding affinity probe to study site-specific adenine nucleotide binding to the ATPase of submitochondrial particles [122]. In contrast to ATP which behaves in aqueous solutions as a weak acid (ATP4\u2212), BzATP has lipophilic characteristics that are contributed by the benzoyl-benzoyl ring, and which could explain its penetration through the epidermis. See, FIG. 21C. BzATP is a relatively stable compound in biological solutions and across a broad range of temperatures and pH, although serum albumin and various plasma lipids can bind BzATP and reduce its potency at P2X7 receptors [123]. BzATP is commercially available in the form of either 2\u2032(3\u2032)-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (C24H24N5O15P3, MW=715.39) or the tri-triethylammonium salt, C24H24N5O15P3.C18H45N3, MW=1018.97). Both BzATP forms have been shown to exert similar anti-apoptotic effects. (data not shown)",
                                "BzATP is a potent and efficacious ligand of the P2X7 receptor, with a 5-10 fold greater potency than ATP [42,50]. Activation of the P2X7 receptor requires the continued presence of the ligand, and treatment with BzATP exerts a prolonged P2X7 effect [124]. In most studied cell types BzATP has been showed to be a specific P2X7 receptor agonist [46-48], but in some cell types BzATP can act as a weak agonist, or a weak antagonist, depending upon the particular P2 receptor subtype: i) P2Y1 [125-127]; ii) P2Y2 [128], and iii) P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3 receptors [48,129]. A study in hippocampal mossy fibers suggested that BzATP can be catabolized extracellularly by ecto-nucleotidases to Bz-adenosine, which can then be transported intracellularly via nucleoside transporters. [130]. Once transported intracellularly, the benzoyl-benzoyl group can be removed by intracellular esterases and the adenosine is released into the extracellular space thereby activating adenosine receptors.",
                                "Despite those isolated reports, most studies using BzATP concur that the predominant observed effects are the result of activation of the P2X7 receptor [131]. Various epithelial cell types, including human and rodents' keratinocytes, have indicated that BzATP effects are not mediated by degradation products of BzATP (e.g. Bz-adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate ADP [BzADP], adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate [AMP], or adenine). In addition, treatments with adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate (ADP), AMP, adenosine, or adenine had no pro-apoptotic effects on the cells. (data not shown).",
                                "The data presented herein demonstrates that BzATP applied locally on the skin, at areas at risk for developing skin papillomas and cancers, showed 50% inhibition of papillomas and skin cancers in animals that were treated with BzATP. It is further shown that a main target of BzATP treatment are P2X7-receptor-expressing reserve cells. In the normal skin, BzATP augmented apoptosis of the reserve cells without evoking inflammatory or atrophic changes, which potentially could have been induced by activation of the P2X7 receptor [46-49]. Specifically, BzATP did not induce tissue loss, thinning, or ulceration. In contrast, treatment with BzATP inhibited papilloma formation, and it inhibited the transformation of papillomas to skin cancers. In the DMBA/TPA mouse model, most early papillomas are histologically benign, but some will progress to squamous cell carcinoma [132,133]. Papillomas at risk for developing into cancer are characterized by increased proliferative capacity of epidermal reserve cells [132]. P2X7-mediated apoptosis has little effect on slow growing normal cells, but it controls the proliferation of rapidly growing cells, while BzATP has the potential for skin chemoprevention by controlling the development of precancerous cells and their transformation into skin cancers. [55] BzATP also induced apoptosis of advanced cancer cells in vivo, but the effect was limited by the low expression of the P2X7 receptor in these cells. See, FIGS. 26T,26V and FIGS. 26S,26U, respectively. P2X7 receptor levels can be increased in normal and in cancer cells by inducing de-methylation of cytosines at CpG sites that control P2X7 transcription. See, FIG. 22; [44].",
                                "Collectively, these data suggest that the pharmacological augmentation of P2X7-mediated apoptosis are prophylatic for skin cancers, and therapeutic for early skin cancerous lesions.",
                                "The initial studies utilized a low BzATP dose of the BzATP and did not result in any local or systemic adverse events. This implies that when administered locally on the skin, BzATP may be a candidate chemotherapeutic growth-preventive drug with high therapeutic and low toxic pharmacological profile. Other epithelia could be considered as potential targets for local treatment with BzATP as well, including the oral mucosa, the vulvar and vaginal epithelia, and the ectocervix. These squamous stratified epithelia are phenotypically similar to the skin; their reserve cells express the P2X7 receptor, and activation of the receptor induces apoptosis. Cancers of these tissues usually develop from premalignant lesions, and similar to the skin the cancer risk can vary from 0.1% to 20% [134-136]. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that activation of P2X7-dependent apoptosis with BzATP could be a novel chemotherapeutic growth-preventive modality for pre-cancerous and early cancerous epithelial lesions.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for treating and preventing cancer comprising activating a P2X7 receptor. For example, the data presented herein show that P2X7-mediated apoptosis controls the growth of skin epithelial cells. In particular, a local application of a P2X7-specific agonist ligand (i.e., for example, BzATP) inhibits formation of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas in mice in vivo. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the observed inhibition may be mediated by a mechanism associated with activation of P2X7-induced apoptosis.",
                                "The data presented herein also show that a P2X7 receptor is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the BzATP pro-apoptotic effect. ATP concentrations in the high nanomolar range of conditioned media of both normal human keratinocytes and human SCC-9 cells support the suggests that a P2X7 receptor mechanism may play a role in in vivo cell regulation of apoptosis and growth. Accordingly, ATP may be secreted by cells into the extracellular milieu, wherein the resultant steady-state ATP levels are sufficient to activate the P2X7 receptor and induce apoptosis. Since steady-state extracellular levels of ATP are similar between normal keratinocytes and SCC-9 cells (infra), it is suspected that P2X7-mediated apoptosis may depend primarily on the expression of the receptor. (Wang et al, 2004a; Feng et al, 2005). In other types of epithelial cells, a lower cellular expression of P2X7 mRNA and receptor levels appear in cancer cells versus normal epithelial cells. This decreased expression was associated with a decreased P2X7-mediated baseline apoptosis rate and/or ligand-induced apoptosis in cancer cells as compared to normal cells. (Wang et al, 2004a; Li et al, 2006; Li et al, 2007). These data may be biologically and clinically important because defective apoptosis could lead to cancer. Gasser and Raulet, 2006; Kujoth et al, 2006; Rodriguez-Nieto and Zhivotovsky, 2006. Further, decreased cellular expression of P2X7 receptor could be causally related to the development of epithelial cancers.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for modulating the growth of epidermal cells by controlling P2X7-mediated apoptosis. In one embodiment, the epidermal cells comprise germinative epidermal cells. In one embodiment, the controlling comprises drugs which activate the P2X7 receptor, wherein formation of a skin neoplasia is inhibited.",
                                "A. Anti-Cancer Agent Screening",
                                "Potential effective drugs may be screened by using a DMBA/TPA mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis model system that is capable of inducing skin squamous cell carcinoma within 20 weeks of treatment. In the course of cancer development, skin papillomas usually arise first (i.e., within 6-15 weeks after initial DMBA/TPA exposure. Glick et al, 2007. The data discussed below using this model showed for the first time that pharmacological stimulation of the P2X7 receptor can inhibit development of epidermal papillomas. Specifically, when DMBA/TPA-treated mice were co-treated with BzATP the incidence of papilloma formation was decreased. In one embodiment, the mean number of papillomas per animal decreased by about 25%. In one embodiment, the mean papilloma size decreased by about 45%. In one embodiment, treated papillomas involuted more frequently. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that a pharmacological activation of the P2X7 receptor in vivo can inhibit formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papillomas and stimulate involution of formed papillomas.",
                                "It is further believed that BzATP treatment effects do not induce any inflammatory skin changes that could potentially be related to P2X7 actions. Dubyak and el-Moatassim, 1993; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998. Also, BzATP treatment did not produce other gross or microscopic effects on the skin, and there were no abnormal changes that could be the result of excessive apoptosis such as thinning or ulcerations. It should be noted that Ki67 levels did not change during BzATP treatment, thereby supporting the conclusion that BaATP effects are primarily due to P2X7 receptor mediated effects.",
                                "Until the present invention, the mechanism by which BzATP-augmented P2X7-apoptosis inhibited DMBA/TPA-induced papilloma formation was unknown. While it is generally believed that carcinogens (e.g. DMBA/TPA) may stimulate uncontrolled growth of proliferating (germinative) cells, the underlying biochemical control of cell growth may be controlled by P2X7-mediated apoptosis (infra). It is therefore possible that the growth and development of papillomas induced by DMBA/TPA was balanced by the apoptotic activity of BzATP-P2X7. One possibility is that these two effects are independent of each other and that the development and rate of growth of papillomas depend on the contributions to regulation of cellular growth made by these two opposing stimuli. An alternative hypothesis, is that activation of the P2X7 receptor inhibits DMBA/TPA cellular and molecular proliferative effects. The signaling pathway and molecular mechanism by which activation of the P2X7 receptor induces apoptosis in keratinocytes has not been clearly characterized.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for treating cancer comprising at least a partial inhibition of papilloma formation. In one embodiment, the inhibition is a result of treatment with a P2X7 receptor agonist. In one embodiment, the P2X7 agonist comprises BzATP. In one embodiment, the agonist is provided as a local application. In one embodiment, the local application comprises a concentration of approximately 1 \u03bcg/cm2 BzATP. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that these inhibitory effects are dose-related such that higher doses have a greater effect in inhibiting papilloma formation.",
                                "In the DMBA/TPA mouse model, most early papillomas are histologically benign, but some progress to a squamous cell carcinoma stage. Glick et al, 2007. The potential for malignant conversion in this model is largely cell autonomous, independent of microenvironmental influences. Woodworth et al, 2004. Papillomas at risk for developing into cancer are usually characterized by increased proliferation of keratinocytes in the basal and suprabasal layers. Glick et al, 2007. This characteristic is relevant because (a) the P2X7 receptor is expressed in basal/parabasal layers of normal stratifying epithelia (Li et al, 2006) including the epidermis (Greig et al, 2003a; and the data presented herein); (b) decreased expression of the P2X7 receptor in basal/parabasal layers can be identified already in premalignant lesions of stratifying epithelia (Li et al, 2006); (c) treatment with BzATP induced activation of the P2X7 receptor in basal/parabasal layers (data presented herein); and (d) BzATP treatment stimulated apoptosis also in basal/parabasal layers of keratinocytes outgrowths at the base of already developed papillomas. See, FIG. 5B(d). Therefore, BzATP may have both preventive and therapeutic effects on the growth of papillomas.",
                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for treating human epithelial cancers. In one embodiment, a P2X7 receptor is expressed by most types of epithelial cells. Surprenant et al, 1996; Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998; Khakh et al, 2001; Wang et al, 2004b; Feng et al, 2006; Li et al, 2006; Li et al, 2007. It is believed that epithelial cancers usually develop from premalignant lesions, and decreased expression of the P2X7 receptor occurs already in early premalignant lesions. Li et al, 2006; Li et al, 2007. Cancer risks of premalignant lesions of stratifying epithelia, e.g. the oral mucosa (leukoplakia), cervix (dysplasia) and the epidermis (actinic keratosis) may vary form 0.1% to 20%, but at present it is difficult to predict which lesions will progress into cancer. Reibel, 2003; Fu and Cockerell, 2003; Lindeque, 2005.",

In one embodiment, the compound comprises BzATP. The data described herein show that BzATP can be absorbed through the skin and may specifically target cells in the germinative layers of the epithelium at the site of drug application. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that pharmacological activation of the P2X7 receptor may control the growth and progression of premalignant lesions through apoptosis without evoking necrosis and an inflammatory or immune response.",

Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the reduced pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP in mouse cancer keratinocytes is possibly the result of low expression of the P2X7 receptor.",

In situ hybridization assays in cultured human normal keratinocytes detected binding of an anti-sense full length P2X7 cDNA probe in perinuclear/cytoplasmic regions, with no reaction to the sense P2X7 cDNA probe. See, FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B, respectively. Similarly, in cultured human normal keratinocytes, P2X7 immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane. See, FIG. 1C.",

Li et al, 2006; Li et al, 2007. The data presented herein show similar trends in epidermal cells. See, FIGS. 1C and 1D. P2X7 immunoreactivity was 3 fold lower in SCC-9 cells than in normal keratinocytes. See, FIGS. 1C and 1D. Likewise, P2X7 mRNA levels were 6 fold lower in SCC-9 cells than in normal keratinocytes. See, FIG. 1E. The decreased P2X7 receptor expression correlated with decreased apoptosis in these cells. For example, both baseline apoptosis and ATP-induced apoptosis were lower in SCC-9 cells than in normal keratinocytes. See, FIG. 1E, insert.",

Quantitative assay of a P2X7-specific band (i.e., for example, 75 KDa) revealed a five-fold lower density in cancer tissues than in normal tissues. See, FIG. 12H. Further confirmation was obtained by P2X7 mRNA experiments where quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays revealed a five-fold lower P2X7 mRNA/GAPDH mRNA ratio in normal tissues than in cancer tissues. See, FIG. 12I. Collectively, these data indicate that P2X7 receptor expression levels in mouse skin cancer tissues are four-five fold lower than in mouse normal skin tissues.",

In these studies, P2X7 immunoreactivities in cross sections of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas did not differ from normal cells in either baseline intensity or after BzATP treatment. See, FIG. 15A and FIG. 15B. In contrast, however, the baseline intensity of P2X7 immunoreactivity in cross sections of skin cancers was significantly lower than in normal and in papilloma tissues. See, FIG. 12A and FIGS. 15A & 15B, respectively. However, as with the papillomas, treatment with BzATP did not effect P2X7 receptor expression in cancer cells. See, FIGS. 15E and 15F, respectively.",

Similar findings were observed in cross sections of normal skin. See, FIGS. 13F and 14G. In contrast, TUNEL staining was more intense in cross sections of papillomas and cancer tissues from the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. See, FIG. 15D and FIG. 15H.

Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that some papillomas may have spontaneously regressed and involuted.

Persistence as non-cancerous lesions was increased after BzATP treatment. For example, in mice co-treated with BzATP the proportion of animals with cancers at week 14 was lower than in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group (50% versus 80%) and remained relatively stable. In contrast, the proportion of animals with cancers increased steadily in the DMBA/TPA group, reaching 100% at week 24. These data suggest that local treatment with BzATP inhibits formation of DMBA/TPA-induced skin papilloma, and it can also inhibit papilloma cell transformation into cancer cells.",
                                "BzATP had little effect on the number of cancerous lesions per animal at weeks 14-28, and on the proportion of animals with cancerous lesions >10 mm3 at weeks 14-22. In contrast, after week 23 the proportion of living animals with cancerous lesions >10 mm3 increased in the DMBA/TPA group while it had decreased in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group. These data suggest that local treatment with BzATP exerts an inhibitory effect on the development on skin neoplasia.",

This effect cannot be explained by augmented proliferation since BzATP did not stimulate DNA synthesis in cultured normal keratinocytes. Instead, the effect could be explained by comparing the survival curves (See, FIG. 11B) and the proportions of animals with smaller and larger size cancerous lesions. See, FIGS. 10B & 10C. Thus, cancer-related deaths in the DMBA/TPA group were associated more often with smaller lesions while cancer-related deaths in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group were associated with relatively larger lesions. This suggests that treatment with BzATP also prolonged the life of animals with developed cancers.",

                                "First, the apoptosis dose-requirements of ATP and of the P2X7-specific agonist BzATP were determined. Treatment of keratinocytes and SCC-9 cells with ATP, or with the P2X7-specific agonist BzATP, augmented apoptosis in a dose-related manner. See, FIG. 2A. It can be observed that ATP was effective at inducing apoptosis at a 100 nM concentration. The data also showed that the combined pro-apoptotic effects of BzATP (100 \u03bcM) with ATP, at either 1 \u03bcM or 250 \u03bcM were non-additive. In contrast, induction of apoptosis with TNF\u03b1 in combination with BzATP was additive. See, FIG. 2A, Insert a). These data suggest that ATP, but not TNF\u03b1, induce apoptosis via the same mechanism of BzATP, i.e. the P2X7 receptor mechanism. Intracellular ATP levels were observed to be 610\u00b150 nM and 460\u00b1250 nM, respectively. These data indicate that ATP is maintained within a concentration range sufficient to activate P2X7-mediated apoptosis. See, FIG. 2A, Insert b.",
                                "It has been suggested that keratinocytes express different types of purinergic receptors and that it might be possible that, in addition to the P2X7 receptor, ATP-related apoptosis was mediated by other types of purinergic receptors. Burnstock, 2006. The above data does not support this speculation. First, the ATP concentration threshold for inducing apoptosis is consistent with a P2X7-mediated effect. Dubyak and el-Moatassim, 1993; and Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998. Second, the combined pro-apoptotic effects of a low (1 \u03bcM) or a high concentration of ATP (250 \u03bcM) with a high concentration of BzATP (100 \u03bcM) did not produce additive responses, suggesting that ATP and BzATP act via a common mechanism (presumably the P2X7 receptor). In contrast, the combined pro-apoptotic effects of BzATP and TNF\u03b1 did produce an additive response, suggesting that BzATP and TNF\u03b1 act via different mechanisms (i.e., for example, the P2X7 receptor versus the TNF\u03b1-TRAIL pathway, respectively). Aggarwal and Rath, 1999. Third, the present data ruled out the possibility that the ATP/BzATP pro-apoptotic response was non-additive due to limited capacity of the cells to undergo apoptosis, because the pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP plus TNF\u03b1 was greater than the BzATP only effect.",

In contrast, baseline apoptosis of N-Myc-hP2X7-MDCK cells was 1.5-fold greater than of WT-MDCK cells and treatment with BzATP augmented the apoptosis 2.5-fold. See, FIG. 2C; Wang et al, 2004a.

                                "To better understand the mechanism of BzATP pro-apoptotic skin effects, experiments utilized cultured primary mouse keratinocytes that were obtained from wild-type mice, and from the P2X7-receptor-deficient P2X7\u2212/\u2212Pfizer (PO mice and P2X7\u2212/\u2212GSK mice.",
                                "In wild-type mouse keratinocytes, BzATP augmented apoptosis in a dose-related manner. Effects began at BzATP levels as low as 50 nM, reaching maximal effect at 100-250 \u03bcM with an estimated BzATP EC50 of about 10 \u03bcM. See, FIG. 16A. Pre-treatment with P2X7-receptor anti-sense oligonucleotide decreased expression of the P2X7-receptor. See, FIG. 16B, insert. The P2X7-receptor antisense oligonucleotide also inhibited baseline apoptosis and blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP. See, FIG. 16B. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the pro-apoptotic effect is likely induced paracrinologically by ATP secreted by the cells. Pre-treatment with random-control oligonucleotides had no effect on P2X7-receptor expression. See, FIG. 16B, insert. Baseline apoptosis or apoptosis induced by BzATP was also unaffected by random-control oligonucleotides. See, FIG. 16B.",
                                "The dependence of the pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP on the expression of the P2X7 receptor was further demonstrated in experiments using keratinocytes obtained from P2X7-receptor-deficient mice. Compared to wild-type mouse keratinocytes, in both the P2X7\u2212/\u2212Pf and P2X7\u2212/\u2212GSK keratinocytes, treatment with 100 \u03bcM BzATP failed to induce apoptosis. See, FIG. 16C.",

                                "In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method for treating cancer comprising activation of a P2X7-mediated calcium pore (i.e., for example, a calcium channel). Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that P2X7-dependent apoptosis may be mediated by calcium influx via P2X7-controlled pores, and involves the mitochondrial caspase-9 pathway.",
                                "In uterine epithelial cells, as well as in other types of cells, P2X7-receptor-dependent apoptosis involves agonist-induced acute calcium influx via P2X7 pores. To understand whether BzATP-induced apoptosis in mouse keratinocytes involves formation of P2X7 pores, experiments compared activation by BzATP of the P2X7 receptor by measuring cytosolic calcium levels and the formation of P2X7 pores by measuring ethidium bromide influx. Feng et al., \u201cA truncated P2X7 receptor variant (P2X7-j) endogenously expressed in cervical cancer cells antagonizes the full-length P2X7 receptor through hetero-oligomerization\u201d J Biol Chem 2006, 281:17228-17237.",
                                "In mouse wild-type keratinocytes, treatment with 100 \u03bcM BzATP in a 1.2 mM Ca2+ solution, induced an acute increase in cytosolic calcium, which lasted at least 6 minutes. Conversely, when 1.2 mM EGTA was added to the solution (i.e., a low calcium solution), BzATP induced a short term spike in cytosolic calcium that quickly returned to normal levels (i.e., the prolonged, sustained, increase in cytosolic calcium was abolished). See, FIG. 17A. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the short-term spike increase in cytosolic calcium most likely represents calcium release from intracellular stores. It is further believed that the lack of prolonged increase in cytosolic calcium in cells bathed in a low calcium extracellular medium low indicates that the BzATP-induced prolonged increase in cytosolic calcium involves calcium influx.",
                                "Experiments using mouse wild-type keratinocytes also revealed that treatment with BzATP induced an acute increase in the influx of ethidium bromide with a time-course similar to the increase in cytosolic calcium. See, FIG. 17B. Comparing the profiles of cytosolic calcium and ethidium bromide demonstrated a similar dose-dependence for BzATP. See, FIG. 17C. Further, these profiles resembled the dose dependence of apoptosis on BzATP with threshold effects at 50-100 nM and pre-maximal responses at 100-250 \u03bcM. See, FIG. 16A.",

See, FIGS. 18A and 18B, respectively. Pre-treatment with the random-control oligonucleotides had no effect on the responses to BzATP.",

                                "In mouse wild-type keratinocytes, lowering extracellular calcium attenuated baseline apoptosis and blocked the BzATP-induced apoptosis in a dose-related manner. See, FIG. 19A. Although it is not necessary to understand the mechanism of an invention, it is believed that the BzATP-augmented apoptosis involves caspase-9 and caspase-3. For example, treatment of mouse wild-type keratinocytes with a caspase-9 inhibitor (i.e., for example, LEHD-FMK) blocked BzATP-induced apoptosis while a caspase-8 inhibitor (i.e., for example, IETD-FMK) did not have a significant effect. See, FIG. 19B. Positive controls including, but not limited to, a specific inhibitor of terminal caspase-3 (i.e., for example, DEVD-FMK) or a non-specific pan-caspase inhibitor (i.e., for example, zVAD-FMK) similarly blocked BzATP-induced apoptosis. See, FIG. 19B.",

                                "To determine if the development of the large cancerous lesions in some animals in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group was the result of a pro-mitogenic effect of BzATP, rates of DNA synthesis (in terms of [3H]-thymidine incorporation) in response to BzATP were measured in mouse wild-type normal keratinocytes. Pre-treatments with the P2X7-receptor anti-sense P2X7 oligonucleotides or the random-control oligonucleotides, and treatments with BzATP had no significant effect on [3]-thymidine incorporation. See, FIG. 20.",
                                "The data showed that the main targets of BzATP in the normal skin are proliferating keratinocytes of the epidermal basal/parabasal layers and hair shafts. In these P2X7-receptor expressing cells, BzATP augmented apoptosis without evoking inflammatory changes. Experiments in P2X7-deficient normal keratinocytes and in normal keratinocytes treated with antisense P2X7 oligonucleotides showed that the P2X7 receptor is a necessary mediator of the pro-apoptotic effect of BzATP, suggesting that the effect of BzATP is mediated by augmentation of P2X7-mediated apoptosis. Similar to normal skin, the main targets of BzATP in papilloma tissues were P2X7-receptor expressing proliferating keratinocytes at the base of developing papillomas. This finding relates to the fact that in the mouse DMBA/TPA model, papillomas at risk for developing into cancer are characterized by rapidly proliferating keratinocytes in the basal and parabasal layers of the papilloma. Glick et al., \u201cThe high-risk benign tumor: evidence from the two stage skin cancer model and relevance for human cancer\u201d Mol Carcinogenesis 2007, 46:605-610.",
                                "Since treatment with BzATP decreased the incidence of DMBA/TPA-induced papillomas and their transformation into cancer, it is likely that the cellular mechanism of BzATP action involved augmented apoptosis of proliferating papilloma keratinocytes bearing the potential of malignant transformation. One of the differences between BzATP effects in the normal skin and in papilloma tissues was the lack of macroscopic effects in the former, while inhibiting the development and growth of papillomas. Thus, treatment with BzATP for 16 weeks in normal mice increased apoptosis in proliferating keratinocytes but it did not produce a thinning or ulceration of the skin, as would be expected of a potent pro-apoptotic drug.",
                                "Similarly, there were no significant differences in the morphological and histological characteristics of unaffected normal skin between animals in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group (BzATP treatment for 30 weeks) and the DMBA/TPA group. However, in the DMBA/TPA+BzATP group, enhanced apoptosis was associated with inhibition of papilloma development. The disparity between BzATP effects between normal and papilloma tissues could be related to differences in the growth rate of the respective keratinocytes. Normal skin cells are slow growing and their overall growth rate is apparently not affected by BzATP. In contrast, in the fast growing papilloma keratinocytes BzATP-induced apoptosis slows and inhibits growth. The data in normal mice also showed that local treatment with BzATP had no adverse systemic effects, suggesting a relatively safe profile for the drug when applied locally on the skin. These data indicate that BzATP is absorbed from the skin into the basal/parabasal epidermal regions and hair shafts. The data also suggest that the predominant effect of BzATP is induction of apoptosis at the site of application, targeting rapidly growing proliferating keratinocytes.",
                                "In contrast to papillomas, the expression level of P2X7 receptors in DMBA/TPA-induced cancer cells was low, as was evident by three assays: in-situ immunoreactivity, Western blots, and qPCR. These findings are similar to those reported in non-melanoma skin cancer cells, uterine, bladder and breast epithelial cancers. Greig et al., \u201cExpression of purinergic receptors in non-melanoma skin cancers and their functional roles in A431 cells\u201d J Invest Dermatol 2003, 121:315-327; Li et al., \u201cThe P2X7 Receptor: A novel biomarker of uterine epithelial cancers\u201d Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Preven 2006, 15:1-8; Li et al., \u201cDecreased expression of P2X7 in endometrial epithelial pre-cancerous and cancer cells\u201d Gynecol Oncology 2007, 106:233-243; Zhou et al., \u201cMicro-RNAs miR-186 and miR-150 downregulate expression of the pro-apoptotic purinergic P2X7 receptor by activation of instability sites at the 3\u2032-untranslated region of the gene that decrease steady-state levels of the transcript\u201d J Biol Chem 2008, 283:28274-28286; and Li et al., \u201cP2X7 receptor expression is decreased in epithelial cancer cells of ectodermal, urogenital sinus, and distal paramesonephric-duct origin\u201d (submitted, 2009). These findings suggest that the rapid proliferation of cancer cells could be in part due to the low expression of the P2X7 receptor and to attenuated P2X7-mediated apoptosis. Treatment with BzATP augmented apoptosis even in cancer cells expressing low levels of the P2X7 receptor, but the effect was smaller than in normal or papilloma cells.",
                                "Until recently, little was known about the relationship between P2X7-receptor and cellular apoptosis. The data presented herein suggest that P2X7-receptor induced apoptosis may depend on enhanced calcium influx via P2X7 pores, and possibly mediated by the caspase-9-mitochondrial pathway.",
                                "The following experimental findings in the present study support this hypothesis:\n\n\n- - (a) Treatment with BzATP induced formation of pores and enhanced\n    calcium influx;\n  - (b) the BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore formation and the augmented\n    and prolonged calcium influx were critically dependent on the\n    expression of the P2X\u2087 receptor;\n  - (c) the BzATP-induced apoptosis, pore formation and the augmented\n    calcium influx had similar dose-dependence on BzATP;\n  - (d) the BzATP-induced pore formation and the augmented calcium\n    influx began shortly (30-60 seconds) after adding BzATP. In\n    contrast, the BzATP-induced apoptosis required hours of treatment\n    with BzATP, commensurate with a gene-mediated effect;\n  - (e) the BzATP-induced apoptosis depended on the presence of\n    extracellular calcium at a physiological concentration of 1.2 mM,\n    and on calcium influx; and\n  - (f) the BzATP-induced apoptosis could be blocked by co-treatment\n    with inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not of caspase-8.  \n    Since caspase-3 is a terminal step in the caspase cascade, a\n    possible interpretation of the present results is that\n    P2X\u2087-receptor-apoptosis is mediated by the caspase-9 (mitochondrial)\n    pathway. Fawthrop et al.,\u201d Mechanisms of cell death\u201d *Arch Toxicol*\n    1991, 65:437-444; and Soti et al., \u201cApoptosis, necrosis and cellular\n    senescence: chaperone occupancy as a potential switch\u201d *Aging Cell*\n    2003, 2:39-45. Collectively, the data presented herein suggest that\n    BzATP-dependent activation of the P2X\u2087 receptor involves formation\n    of pores in the plasma membrane, and that facilitated uncontrolled\n    influx of Ca\u00b2\u207a via the P2X\u2087 pores stimulates apoptosis by the\n    mitochondrial-caspase-9 pathway. P2X\u2087 pores are believed to be\n    formed of channels composed of pannexins and ectodomains of the P2X\u2087\n    molecule, whose formation is dependent upon a P2X\u2087 receptor/agonist\n    interaction.

                                "Papilloma keratinocytes are shown herein to express the P2X7 receptor; therefore, the high expression levels of the P2X7 receptor in in vivo papilloma cells, and the significant apoptotic effects in response to BzATP, could explain the inhibitory effect of BzATP on papilloma development. In contrast, the lesser effect of BzATP in skin cancer cells could be explained by the low expression level of the P2X7 receptor in the cancer cells. At present, little is known whether neoplastic transformation decreases P2X7-receptor expression, or whether neoplastic transformation is triggered preferentially in cells already expressing low levels of P2X7 receptor. The former possibility is supported by data in endometrial and bladder cells where low expression of the P2X7 receptor was found already in pre-cancerous and early cancerous cells but not in hyperplastic benign cells. Li et al., \u201cDecreased expression of P2X7 in endometrial epithelial pre-cancerous and cancer cells\u201d Gynecol Oncology 2007, 106:233-243. Accordingly, the carcinogenic process could have reduced P2X7 expression during early stages of cancer development. On the other hand, the possibility that the neoplastic transformation is triggered preferentially in cells expressing low levels of the receptor is supported by data in uterine cervical epithelia, wherein low expression of the P2X7 receptor was found already in dysplastic cells. Li et al., \u201cThe P2X7 Receptor: A novel biomarker of uterine epithelial cancers\u201d Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Preven 2006 15:1-8. Since only a small fraction of cervical dysplasia cases progresses to cancer, it is possible that low expression of the P2X7 receptor in the cervix precedes the neoplastic transformation. Walboomers et al., \u201cHuman papillomavirus is a necessary cause of invasive cervical cancer worldwide\u201d J Pathol 1999, 189:12-19: Raab et al., \u201cLong-term outcome and relative risk in women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance\u201d Am J Clin Pathol 1999, 112:57-62; and Song et al., \u201cRisk factors for the progression or persistence of untreated mild dysplasia of the uterine cervix\u201d Int J Gynecol Cancer 2006, 16:1608-1613. Accordingly, abrogation of P2X7-mediated apoptosis could be responsible for the preservation of genetically aberrant cells that are susceptible to carcinogenic stimuli, favoring neoplastic transformation.

                                "To define the active promoter region and the Transcription Initiation Start Site (TpIS), a series of cDNA fragments were generated encompassing a 1.7 kb DNA segment at the 5\u2032 region of the human P2X7 gene. Nucleotides were numbered relative to the subsequently elucidated TpIS (+1), which corresponds with nt 1683 of the human P2X7 gene (GenBank Y12851). Initial experiments included cDNA fragments ranging from \u22121664/+32 to \u221253/+32 nt. See, FIG. 28 and FIG. 29A. The cDNA fragments were inserted into a luciferase vector, and the P2X7-luciferase reporter was transfected into HEK293 cells which lack endogenous expression of the P2X7. Significant promoter activity was found in fragments ranging from \u22121664/+32 to \u2212158/+32 nt, while shorter fragments lacked significant promoter activity. A cDNA fragment of \u22121179/\u2212380 nt lacked significant promoter activity, suggesting that there is little promoter activity upstream of nt \u2212380. Since maximal promoter activity was found in experiments using the \u2212158/+32 nt fragment, the data suggested location of the active promoter of the human P2X7 gene in the \u2212158/+32 nt region. See, FIG. 29A.",

For example, P2X7 receptor agonists can be administered by methods suitable enteral or parenteral administration route. Suitable enteral administration routes for the present methods include, but are not limited to, oral, rectal, or intranasal delivery. Suitable parenteral administration routes include, but are not limited to, intravascular administration (i.e., for example, intravenous bolus injection, intravenous infusion, intra-arterial bolus injection, intra-arterial infusion and catheter installation into the vasculature); peri- and intra-tissue injection (i.e., for example, peri-tumoral and intra-tumoral injection, intra-retinal injection, or subretinal injection); subcutaneous injection or deposition, including, but not limited to, subcutaneous infusion (i.e., for example, by osmotic pumps); direct application to the tissue of interest, for example by a catheter or other placement device (i.e., for example, a retinal pellet or a suppository or an implant comprising a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material); and inhalation. Another administration route includes, but is not limited to, injection and/or infusion directly into a tumor.",
                                "Liposomes are used to deliver P2X7 receptor agonists to a subject. Liposomes can also increase the blood half-life of the gene products or nucleic acids. Liposomes suitable for use in the invention can be formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral or negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of factors such as the desired liposome size and half-life of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods can be used for preparing liposomes. Szoka et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.",

Such modified liposomes have opsonization-inhibition moieties on the surface or incorporated into the liposome structure. In one embodiment, a liposome of the invention can comprise both opsonization-inhibition moieties and a ligand.",
                                "Opsonization-inhibiting moieties for use in preparing the liposomes of the invention are typically large hydrophilic polymers that are bound to the liposome membrane. As used herein, an opsonization inhibiting moiety is \u201cbound\u201d to a liposome membrane when it is chemically or physically attached to the membrane, e.g., by the intercalation of a lipid-soluble anchor into the membrane itself, or by binding directly to active groups of membrane lipids. These opsonization-inhibiting hydrophilic polymers form a protective surface layer that significantly decreases the uptake of the liposomes by the MMS and RES. U.S. Pat. No. 4,920,016, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.",
                                "Opsonization inhibiting moieties suitable for modifying liposomes are preferably water-soluble polymers with a number-average molecular weight from about 500 to about 40,000 daltons, and more preferably from about 2,000 to about 20,000 daltons. Such polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycol (PPG) derivatives; e.g., methoxy PEG or PPG, and PEG or PPG stearate; synthetic polymers such as polyacrylamide or poly N-vinyl pyrrolidone; linear, branched, or dendrimeric polyamidoamines; polyacrylic acids; polyalcohols, e.g., polyvinylalcohol and polyxylitol to which carboxylic or amino groups are chemically linked, as well as gangliosides, such as ganglioside GM1. Copolymers of PEG, methoxy PEG, or methoxy PPG, or derivatives thereof, are also suitable. In addition, the opsonization inhibiting polymer can be a block copolymer of PEG and either a polyamino acid, polysaccharide, polyamidoamine, polyethyleneamine, or polynucleotide. The opsonization inhibiting polymers can also be natural polysaccharides containing amino acids or carboxylic acids, e.g., galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, mannuronic acid, hyaluronic acid, pectic acid, neuraminic acid, alginic acid, carrageenan; aminated polysaccharides or oligosaccharides (linear or branched); or carboxylated polysaccharides or oligosaccharides, e.g., reacted with derivatives of carbonic acids with resultant linking of carboxylic groups. Preferably, the opsonization-inhibiting moiety is a PEG, PPG, or derivatives thereof. Liposomes modified with PEG or PEG-derivatives are sometimes called \u201cPEGylated liposomes.\u201d",

For example, an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of PEG can be bound to a phosphatidyl-ethanolamine lipid-soluble anchor, and then bound to a membrane. Similarly, a dextran polymer can be derivatized with a stearylamine lipid-soluble anchor via reductive amination using Na(CN)BH3 and a solvent mixture, such as tetrahydrofuran and water in a 30:12 ratio at 60\u00b0 C.",
                                "Liposomes modified with opsonization-inhibition moieties remain in the circulation much longer than unmodified liposomes. For this reason, such liposomes are sometimes called \u201cstealth\u201d liposomes. Stealth liposomes are known to accumulate in tissues fed by porous or \u201cleaky\u201d microvasculature. Thus, tissue characterized by such microvasculature defects, for example solid tumors, will efficiently accumulate these liposomes. Gabizon, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 18:6949-6953 (1988). In addition, the reduced uptake by the RES lowers the toxicity of stealth liposomes by preventing significant accumulation of the liposomes in the liver and spleen. Thus, liposomes that are modified with opsonization-inhibition moieties are particularly suited to deliver the miRNA gene products or miRNA gene expression inhibition compounds (or nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding them) to tumor cells."

To convert CpG non-associated cytosines to uracil (and thymidines), 1 mg of genomic DNA was denatured with 2 M NaOH at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min; 30 \u03bcl of 10 mM hydroquinone were added and the solution was incubated with 3M sodium bisulfite (pH 5) at 53\u00b0 C. for 16 hours in darkness. After treatment, DNA was purified by DNA clean up kit (Promega). The solution was incubated with 2 M NaOH at room temperature and precipitated with 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of distilled water. The bisulfite treated DNA was amplified by PCR (95\u00b0 C. 5 min/95\u00b0 C. 30 sec/55-59\u00b0 C. 45 sec/and 72\u00b0 C. 45 sec, 37 cycles). PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and separated in 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 W for 3 hours and the amplified products were checked for accuracy by sequencing. Positive control for the DNA methylation experiments was human placental genomic DNA treated with the CpG-Methylase M.SssI and the negative control was water. DNA methylation was determined from the polyacrylamide gel pictures in terms of samples showing de-novo appearance of a low MW band, corresponding to a cleaved band at a previously methylated site. The degree of methylation was determined by densitometry in terms of the intensity of the cleaved fragment (lower MW band) relative to the density of the non-methylated plus the methylated bands (lower plus higher MW bands). Densitometry was done as described.

PCR products were purified with PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and cloned into vector pCR II-TOPO (Invitrogen). Subclones were transformed into E-Coli bacteria type BL21 and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0 C. Plasmid-containing PCR products were extracted with miniprep kit (Promega) and sequenced.
