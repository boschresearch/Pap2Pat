    "abstract": "Diabetic patients exhibit a reduction in \u03b2 cells, which secrete insulin to help regulate glucose homeostasis; however, little is known about the factors that regulate proliferation of these cells in human pancreas. Access to primary human \u03b2 cells is limited and a challenge for both functional studies and drug discovery progress. We previously reported the generation of a human \u03b2 cell line (EndoC-\u03b2H1) that was generated from human fetal pancreas by targeted oncogenesis followed by in vivo cell differentiation in mice. EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells display many functional properties of adult \u03b2 cells, including expression of \u03b2 cell markers and insulin secretion following glucose stimulation; however, unlike primary \u03b2 cells, EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells continuously proliferate. Here, we devised a strategy to generate conditionally immortalized human \u03b2 cell lines based on Cre-mediated excision of the immortalizing transgenes. The resulting cell line (EndoC-\u03b2H2) could be massively amplified in vitro. After expansion, transgenes were efficiently excised upon Cre expression, leading to an arrest of cell proliferation and pronounced enhancement of \u03b2 cell\u2013specific features such as insulin expression, content, and secretion. Our data indicate that excised EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells are highly representative of human \u03b2 cells and should be a valuable tool for further analysis of human \u03b2 cells.",

                "Insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells play a central role in glycemic regulation. Such \u03b2 cells are destroyed in patients with type 1 diabetes, while in type 2 diabetes patients, functional \u03b2 cell mass decreases and to a certain point fails to produce enough insulin to insure adequate blood glucose control. In this context, dissecting the mechanisms that control the size of the human \u03b2 cell pool represents a major challenge.",
                "During the past years, significant progress appeared on mechanisms that regulate \u03b2 cell mass in the adult pancreas. In adult mice, while \u03b2 cells develop from rare adult pancreatic progenitors following partial pancreatic duct ligation, it is now accepted that during adulthood under normal or regenerative conditions, the majority of the newly formed \u03b2 cells are generated by \u03b2 cell duplication (1). The demonstration of the importance of rodent \u03b2 cell proliferation as the main regulator of \u03b2 cell mass (2) was paralleled by a large amount of data that dissected signals and pathways that control rodent \u03b2 cell proliferation (3). In this context, betatrophin was recently characterized as a new hormone that efficiently controls mouse \u03b2 cell proliferation (4). Thus, \u03b2 cell proliferation represents an important parameter in \u03b2 cell mass regulation in mice.",
                "In humans, little is known about control of \u03b2 cell mass in the adult pancreas. However, human \u03b2 cell proliferation is rare in the adult pancreas (5) and human \u03b2 cell turnover is extremely low, as determined by in vivo thymidine analog incorporation, radiocarbon dating, and mathematical modeling of lipofuscin accumulation (6,7). Moreover, when compared with what occurs in mice, very few signals are described as activating human \u03b2 cell proliferation (8). Finally, human \u03b2 cells seem refractory to forced cell expansion, and this point remains unexplained (9). This lack of knowledge is at least in part due to limited access to purified human \u03b2 cells in sufficient quantities.",
                "Recently, by targeted oncogenesis, we generated a human pancreatic \u03b2 cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H1 (10,11). Human fetal pancreases were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing the large T antigen of simian virus 40 (SV40 LT) and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and were transplanted into SCID mice to allow pancreatic differentiation (11). Importantly, the immortalizing transgenes were under the control of the rat insulin 2 promoter. Thus, the human \u03b2 cells that developed in SCID mice during tissue differentiation expressed the transgenes leading to the development of insulinomas that were further amplified in culture to generate cell lines such as EndoC-\u03b2H1 (10). EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells expressed insulin and numerous \u03b2 cell-specific markers and secreted insulin upon glucose and secretagogue stimulation. Collectively, the phenotype and function of EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells are close to that of primary adult human \u03b2 cells with one major difference. Indeed, as described above, human adult \u03b2 cells proliferate extremely poorly, while EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells are continuously expanding.",
                "Here, we generated a human \u03b2 cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H2, by targeted oncogenesis with lentiviral vectors expressing excisable SV40 LT and hTERT. Following excision of immortalizing transgenes, cell proliferation sharply decreased, which was paralleled by a massive enhancement of \u03b2 cell-specific features such as increased insulin gene expression and content. Such a cell line represents a major step forward toward the development of authentic human \u03b2 cells. It also represents a unique tool for studying human \u03b2 cell proliferation. mogranin-A (CHGA), as was the case for human adult pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The insulinoma stained negative for glucagon, a marker of \u03b1 cells, and for carboxypeptidase-A (CPA), a marker of acinar cells (Supplemental Figure 1B). Finally, very rare cells in the insulinoma coexpressed insulin and somatostatin (Supplemental Figure 1B).",
                "The remaining part of the insulinoma was dissociated and used to derive a human \u03b2 cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H2 (Supplemental Figure 1C), using previously described culture conditions (10). PCR performed on genomic DNA indicated that EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells have integrated both SV40 LT and hTERT transgenes (Supplemental Figure 1D). EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells proliferated with a doubling time of 5 to 7 days. Immunocytochemistry indicated that EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells were positive for insulin, C-peptide, CHGA, PDX1, and NKX6-1 (Figure 1B). Cells were positive for SV40 LT and were proliferating as indicated by Ki67 staining (Figure 1B). Cells stained negative for glucagon, and only rare cells were observed that expressed somatostatin (Figure 1B). EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells stained negative for CPA and amylase, 2 acinar markers, and for SOX9, a ductal marker (Figure 1B).",
                "Cre-mediated excision of immortalizing transgenes sharply decreases EndoC-\u03b2H2 cell proliferation. We transduced EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells with increasing amounts of lentiviral vector (from 15 ng to 60 ng of p24 capside protein per 10 5 cells) expressing Cre under the control of a CMV ubiquitous promoter to titrate the amount of Cre-expressing lentiviral vector that yielded optimal transduction efficacy with a minimal amount of lentiviral vector (Supplemental Figure 2A). We used the appropriate lentiviral titer (15 ng of p24 capsid protein per 10 5 cells) to transduce EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells with a Cre-expressing lentiviral vector. As a control, 60 ng of p24 capside protein (highest"

                        "We previously developed a human \u03b2 cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H1, by targeted oncogenesis mediated by lentiviral integration of 2 immortalizing transgenes, SV40 LT and hTERT, in human fetal pancreas (10). Here, we aimed at generating conditionally immortalized \u03b2 cell lines in which immortalizing transgenes could be excised. For this purpose, lentiviral vectors were modified through the insertion of a loxP site within the U3 truncated region (Delta U3) of the 3\u2032 LTR. In such a configuration, after integration in the genome of transduced cells, the Delta U3 loxP region is duplicated and 2 loxP sites flank the integrated sequences, allowing subsequent excision dependent on Cre recombinase expression (Figure 1A).",
                        "Excisable lentiviral vectors were constructed to express SV40 LT or hTERT under the control of a 405-nt fragment of the rat insulin-2 promoter. A 9-week-old human fetal pancreas was simultaneously transduced with both lentiviral vectors and transplanted under the kidney capsule of a recipient SCID mouse. At 6.5 months later, an insulinoma had developed from the transplanted tissue. The insulinoma was removed, dissociated, and further amplified in vivo by 3 successive rounds of transplantation (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI72674DS1). Part of the final insulinoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Insulinoma cells stained positive for insulin and SV40 LT (Supplemental Figure 1B). They also stained positive for Ki67, which was not the case for human adult pancreatic \u03b2 cells. The insulinoma cells stained positive for PDX1 and expressed the pan-endocrine marker chro- sion of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) that is negatively linked to cell cycle strongly increased following transgene deletion (Figure 3). Interestingly, in the nonexcised versus islet comparison, the same ingenuity categories were retrieved and displayed similarly highly significant P values (Table 1). This demonstrates that nonexcised cells are as distant from islets as they are from excised cells with respect to cell-cycle functions. More importantly, when excised cells were compared with islets, the previously observed differences failed to be significant (P > 0.05) for 11 out of 16 ingenuity function annotations. Although 5 ingenuity function annotations were still significantly different, their corresponding P values were always much less significant (i.e., interphase P values varied from 10 -14 to 10 -6 ) (Table 1). Finally, comparative analyses of cell-cycle-related genes performed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and Western blot further demonstrated that the expression of CDK1, CCNE2, and CCNB2 decreased following excision to reach levels that resemble those found in islets (Supplemental Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 4). Interestingly, CCND1 was found absent in EndoC-\u03b2H2 but expressed in islet cell preparations (Supplemental Figure 4).",
                        "Gene expression pattern in EndoC-\u03b2H2. Comparative transcriptomic analysis was next performed to determine the expression profile of EndoC-\u03b2H2 before and after transgene excision in comparison with human islet preparation and the human duct cell line SKPC (12). It revealed that nonexcised EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells were highly enriched in the expression of a large number of \u03b2 cell-specific genes (Figure 4A). Similar comparisons indicated very low levels of expression of exocrine genes in nonexcised EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, the expression of exocrine markers did not increase following excision, while the expression of \u03b2 cell markers did not decrease following excision (Figure 4). In fact, as described below, the expression of a set of \u03b2 cell-specific markers increased following excision. Collectively, both before and after transgene titer tested) of a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector was used. Cells were analyzed 21 days following transduction. At the RNA level, upon Cre transduction, SV40 LT levels decreased by 92% and exogenous hTERT expression was reduced by 96% (Figure 2A). Such a sharp decrease in SV40 LT levels was also observed by immunocytochemistry (Figure 2B). Moreover, upon Cre transduction, Ki67 mRNA levels decreased by 97%, an effect that was not observed when cells were transduced with a GFP-expressing lentiviral vector (Figure 2C). This major decrease in Ki67 expression was paralleled by a decrease in BrdU incorporation in Cre-expressing cells. Specifically, over a 1-hour pulse period, 14% of nontransduced cells incorporated BrdU whereas 0.9% of Cre-transduced cells incorporated BrdU (Figure 2D). Of note, EndoC-\u03b2H2 efficiently survived the virus-mediated excision procedure. Specifically, with 15 ng per 10 5 cells of Cre-expressing vector, cell number was decreased by 7% at day 7. This level of decrease was similar to that found when cells were transduced with a GFP-expressing vector. By days 14 and 21, as expected, \u03b2 cell number increased in cells transduced with a GFP-expressing vector at 60 ng of p24 capside protein (the highest concentration tested), while cell number decreased very slowly in cells transduced with 15 ng of p24 capside protein per 10 5 cells of Cre-expressing vector (15.8% decrease at day 14 and 21% decrease at day 21) (Supplemental Figure 2B).",
                        "Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated significant differences between nonexcised and excised cells for 16 ingenuity function annotations linked to cell cycle with highly significant P values (between 2.66 \u00d7 10 -20 and 1.54 \u00d7 10 -3 ) (Table 1). Specifically, the expression of many genes positively linked to cell proliferation decreased upon transgenes deletion. This is for example the case for cell division cycle family members (CDCs), kinesin family members (KIF), cyclin-dependent kinases such as CDK1, cyclins (CCN), E2F transcription factors, and additional cell-cycle-related genes such as MKI67 and FOXM1 (Figure 3). Similarly, the expres- Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed using 3 different comparisons: EndoC-\u03b2H2 excised versus nonexcised cells; EndoC-\u03b2H2 nonexcised cells versus islets; and EndoC-\u03b2H2 excised cells versus islets.

Moreover, RT-QPCR analyses indicated that the expression of a number of genes linked to \u03b2 cell function increased following Cre-mediated transgene deletion. This was the case for IAPP, SLC2A2, KCNJ11, ABCC8, and RAB3A (Figure 5E).

Interestingly, at all glucose concentrations tested, the absolute values of secreted insulin per hour were much higher in excised cells compared with control nonexcised cells (Figure 7A). Nonexcised cells failed to respond to glucose stimulation in the absence of IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular levels of cAMP, but responded to glucose in the presence of IBMX. In the presence of IBMX, the stimulation index of nonexcised cells, defined as the ratio of secreted insulin at 15 mM glucose compared with 0.5 mM glucose, was 2.0 (Figure 7B). In excised cells, glucose induced insulin secretion both in the absence and in the presence of IBMX, with stimulation indexes of 3.8 and 3.02, respectively (Figure 7C).",

Interestingly, when compared with islets, the expression of both MAFA and GLIS3 was particularly low in nonexcised cells, while the other transcription factors were expressed at similar level as in islets. Following transgene excision in EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells, we observed an 8-fold increase of MAFA expression (same magnitude as insulin induction) and a 2.5-fold increase in GLIS3 expression (Figure 6). Taken together, such data suggest that the increased expression of MAFA and GLIS3 that is particularly low in nonexcised cells could explain the important increase in insulin mRNA level that takes place following Cre-mediated excision.",

                "During the past 30 years, many studies aimed at generating functional human pancreatic \u03b2 cell lines showed an extremely low success rate (13,14). Interestingly, in 2011, we and another independent laboratory generated human pancreatic \u03b2 cell lines. The \u03b2 cell lines developed by the Flatt's laboratory were generated by electrofusion of freshly isolated human pancreatic \u03b2 cells and the immortal human PANC-1 epithelial cell line (15). They contained limited amounts of insulin, but insulin secretion was dependent on glucose levels. We developed human \u03b2 cell lines using an approach based on targeted oncogenesis by transducing human fetal pancreases with lentiviral vectors that expressed SV40 LT and hTERT under the control of the insulin promoter. One cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H1, developed with this approach expressed fair amounts of insulin, and insulin secretion was regulated by glucose (10). EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells shared many similarities with primary human \u03b2 cells. However, as a cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H1 cells are in essence proliferating cells, while primary human adult \u03b2 cells proliferate extremely poorly. In order to move closer to a genuine human \u03b2 cell, we developed in the present work a conditionally immortalized human pancreatic \u03b2 cell line.",
                "As a first step, we developed new insulinomas using excisable lentiviral vectors, from which we derived a new human \u03b2 cell line, EndoC-\u03b2H2, which was analyzed in detail. Currently, studies on human \u03b2 cell biology are dependent on access to preparations of human islets derived from cadaveric donors. In addition to limited access to human islet preparations and to major variability from one donor to the other, \u03b2 cells only represent a subfraction of cells present in islet preparations that contain other endocrine cell types, but also exocrine cells (16,17). This lack of \u03b2 cell purity Collectively, our data demonstrate that upon Cre expression, SV40 LT and hTERT can be efficiently excised in the EndoC-\u03b2H2 cell line, leading to proliferation arrest and enhancement of \u03b2 cell function.",

                "Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH array) profiles indicated that, as expected for SV40LT-transformed cells, the chromosomal structure of the cells was abnormal (Supplemental Figure 5). But most importantly, when CGH array analysis was performed at 2 different passages, namely p34 and p85, the exact same profile was observed, indicating that although chromosomal structure was abnormal, the structure is very stable over time (Supplemental Figure 5). Indeed, within a complete year in culture from p34 to p85, no changes were observed, suggesting that continuous SV40LT expression by EndoC-\u03b2H2 does not induce cumulative chromosomal modifications.",
                "Insulin content was measured at passages 46, 59, 62, and 77. It was stable before excision (minimal value 0.062 \u03bcg/million cells at passage 62; maximal value 0.090 \u03bcg/million cells at passage 59) and systematically increased following excision (minimal value 1.98 \u03bcg/million cells at passage 62; maximal value 2.75 \u03bcg/million cells excision via the Cre recombinase (20)(21)(22). Similar approaches were used to produce reversely immortalized human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and \u03b2 cells (23,24) and primate hepatic progenitor cell lines (25). However, the first \u03b2 cell line developed with this approach rapidly lost insulin expression (23). The second line, NAKT-15, reported in 2005 (24), was not further studied or distributed despite its promising \u03b2 cell-specific properties. In addition, upon Cre-mediated SV40 LT deletion in primate hepatic progenitor cell lines, cells exhibited picnotic or fragmented nuclei characteristics of apoptosis and died, which was suggested to be due to p53 accumulation (25). Here, we used excisable lentiviral vectors to generate a stable conditionally immortalized functional human \u03b2 cell line. We found that immortalizing transgenes can be efficiently deleted in more than 90% of EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells, giving rise to cellular growth arrest. This demonstrated that proliferation was dependent upon transgene expression. In our present work, cell death following Cre expression was a minor phenomenon and cells survived efficiently for at least 3 weeks following excision. In fact, we performed the majority of the experiments 3 weeks following Cre transduction, and not only did excised cells survive, but the expression of a number of markers of differentiated \u03b2 cells increased. This was the case for insulin and the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is coexpressed and cosecreted with insulin by primary \u03b2 cells (26). This is also the case for the glucose transporter SLC2A2, for ABCC8 and KCNJ11 and for RAB3A, which are all implicated in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (27). Our data thus indicate that by deleting immortalizing transgenes and blocking cell proliferation, we increased the \u03b2 cell differentiation status. \u03b2 Cells are highly differentiated cells with more than 30% of mRNA that encodes insulin (28). Developing and maintaining such a differentiated status is an active process that requires energy (29). Energy is also necessary for cell proliferation. We thus hypothesize that the observed increase of \u03b2 cell differentiation status following cell growth arrest reflects the classical but not yet fully explained balance between the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. The above-described model will be useful in dissecting how this balance is regulated.",
                "In 2004, Dor and colleagues demonstrated the major role of \u03b2 cell proliferation in \u03b2 cell mass regulation in adult mice (2), and this seminal work was followed by a series of studies that analyzed \u03b2 cell proliferation in humans. Since then, while major progress appeared on rodent \u03b2 cell proliferation, information on human \u03b2 cell proliferation remained extremely scarce (8). This is at least in part due to the difficult access to primary human islets. This is also due to the fact that \u03b2 cells represent only a sub-fraction of such human islet cell preparations, which complicates the use of human islet preparations in large-scale screenings. Here, we demonstrate that excised EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells express very low levels of CDK1, CCNE2, and CCNB2, as is the case for human islets, while in such preparations represents a limitation in the interpretation of data derived from transcriptomic analysis. Here, comparative transcriptional analyses indicated that EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells expressed the set of \u03b2 cell-specific genes also found in human islet cell preparations. Moreover, while the expression of many exocrine markers was detected in human islet cell preparations, this was not the case in EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells. Such a new cell line will thus be useful for experiments where large numbers of pure insulin-producing human pancreatic \u03b2 cells are needed.",
                "In the past, a number of approaches were used to produce conditionally immortalized cell lines. A thermosensitive variant of SV40 LT and approaches based on tetracyclin-mediated regulation of SV40 LT expression have been used to respectively develop mouse striatal progenitor cell lines (18) and mouse \u03b2 cell lines (19). Control of immortalizing transgene expression was also achieved in a more permanent way. Conditionally immortalized cell lines were produced following retroviral-mediated stable integration of immortalizing transgenes flanked by loxP sites, allowing their Insulin secretion by EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells following Cre-mediated excision. EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells were transduced with Cre-expressing lentiviral vectors and analyzed 21 days later. Control nonexcised and excised EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells were tested for static insulin secretion under various glucose concentrations in the presence or absence of IBMX. In A, results are expressed as ng of secreted insulin per hour. In B and C, insulin secretion is presented as percentage of insulin content. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM of 3 independent wells per condition assayed by ELISA. The experiment was replicated 2 times.",

They were next transplanted under the kidney capsule of SCID mice as previously described (10). At 6.5 months later, insulinoma was formed in the transplanted tissue. Three successive rounds of transplantation in SCID mice were used to amplify the insulinoma cells prior to establishment of the cell line. Subtransplantation and culture conditions are described elsewhere (10) Immunostaining of pancreatic explants and cell lines. Tissues were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde prior to their embedding in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, sections (4-\u03bcm thick) were prepared and processed, as described previously (10). For immunocytochemistry, EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells were cultured on 12-mm glass cover slips that were coated with Matrigel and fibronectin. After 5 days, the cells were then fixed for 1 hour in 4% paraformaldehyde.

                "RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from all different cell lines using the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), as described previously (10). First-strand cDNA was prepared using Superscript reagents (Invitrogen), and RT-QPCR was done using either Assays-on-Demand kits (Applied Biosystems), LightCycler 480 SYBR Green 1 Master Mix (Roche), or LightCycler 1536 DNA Green Master Mix (Roche) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) or on a the expression of such cell-cycle-related factors is activated in proliferating EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells. CDK1, CCNE2, and CCNB2 should thus be used as readouts in screens aiming at defining new signals that activate human \u03b2 cell proliferation. We also observed that, as expected, CCND3 is expressed both in human islet preparations and in EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells (30). On the other hand, we observed that CCND1 is absent from EndoC-\u03b2H2 cells (both nonexcised and excised), but detectable in islet preparations. Such data suggest that CCND1 is not a perfect readout for human \u03b2 cell proliferation, taking into account that CCND1 cannot be detected by immunohistochemistry on sections of human adult pancreas (The Human Protein Atlas [http://www.proteinatlas.org] and our unpublished data).",
                "In the adult pancreas, human \u03b2 cell proliferation is extremely low (5,31). It was found that human \u03b2 cell replication could be activated not only upon glucose stimulation (32), but also by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of cell-cycle regulators (33). It is, however, important to keep in mind that in such studies, \u03b2 cell replication was quantified following BrdU staining that indicates S-phase entry. Recent studies suggest that forced activation of cell-cycle entry could give rise to accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in a lack of final \u03b2 cell expansion (9). In this context, it is of major importance to measure \u03b2 cell mass and \u03b2 cell numbers upon stimulation. However, it was recently indicated that no laboratory has developed techniques that provide unequivocal evidence of productive human \u03b2 cell expansion in vitro or in vivo (34). The excisable human \u03b2 cell line we created represents a unique tool not only for screening for signals that activate human \u03b2 cell proliferation, but also for determining why human \u03b2 cells proliferate so poorly."

New lentiviral vectors, pTRIP \u0394U3 loxP. RIP405-SV40 LT and pTRIP \u0394U3 loxP.RIP405-hTERT, were constructed. The loxP 3\u2032 LTR cassette was amplified by PCR from the SIN-loxP vector (provided by B. Thorens, Lausanne University, Lausanne Switzerland) with the Kpn primer 5\u2032-CGGGGTACCTTTAAGACCAATGACTTACA-3\u2032 and the PacI primer 5\u2032-CGGTTAATTAAGAACTACTACTGCTAGA-3\u2032. The 378-bp resulting PCR fragment was digested by KpnI and PacI restriction endonucleases and next inserted in the SV40 LT and hTERT lentiviral vectors to replace the \u0394U3 3\u2032 LTR by a loxP 3\u2032 LTR.
