    "title": "System, Method and Software for Calculation of a Cannabis Drug Efficiency Index for the Reduction of Inflammation",
    "date": "2020-12-31",
    "abstract": "There are many varieties of Cannabis sativa that differ from each other by composition of cannabinoids, terpenes and other molecules. The medicinal properties of these cultivars are often very different, with some being more efficient than others. This report describes the development of a method and software for the analysis of the efficiency of various cannabis extracts to detect the anti-inflammatory properties of the various cannabis extracts. The method uses high-throughput gene expression profiling data but can potentially use other omics data as well. According to the signaling pathway topology, the gene expression profiles are convoluted into the signaling pathway activities using a signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) method. The method was tested by inducing inflammation in human 3D epithelial tissues, including intestine, oral and skin, and then exposing these tissues to various extracts and then performing transcriptome analysis. The analysis showed a different efficiency of the various extracts in restoring the transcriptome changes to the pre-inflammation state, thus allowing to calculate a different cannabis drug efficiency index (CDEI).",

                "In the twentieth century, enormous strides have been made in combatting various diseases. Treatment of chronic diseases still remains to be more challenging than acute ones. This is often due to substantial differences in individual responses to known drugs. Over the last few decades, with the advent of genomics and epigenomics, research has focused on the development of personalized medicine. A need has arisen to develop diagnostic tools for use in the characterization of personalized aspects of chronic diseases.",
                "Intracellular signaling pathways (SPs) regulate numerous processes involved in normal and pathological conditions, including development, growth, aging and cancer. Many intracellular signaling pathways or maps are available at online websites. The information relating to signaling pathway activation (SPA) can be obtained from the massive proteomic or transcriptomic data [1]. Although the proteomics analysis may be somewhat closer to the biological function of SPA, the transcriptomics analysis is far more feasible in terms of performing experimental tests and analyzing the data.",
                "The transcriptomic methods like next-generation sequencing (NGS) or microarray analysis of RNA can routinely determine the expression levels for all or virtually all human genes [2]. Transcriptome profiling may be performed from a minute amount of the tissue sample, which does not necessarily need to be fresh, as it can also be done for the clinical formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. For the molecular analysis of cancer, gene expression can be interpreted in terms of abnormal SPA features of various pro- and antimitotic signaling pathways [3]. Such an analysis may improve any decision-making process for treatment strategy selection by the clinician.",
                "Pro- and antimitotic SPs that determine various stages of cell cycle progression remained in the spotlight of computational biologists for more than a decade [4,5]. Today, hundreds of SPs and related gene product interaction maps that show sophisticated relationships between the individual molecules are catalogued in various databases, such as UniProt [6], HPRD [7], QIAGEN SABiosciences, WikiPathways [8], Ariadne Pathway Studio [9], SPIKE [10], Reactome [11], KEGG [12], etc.",
                "Many bioinformatics tools have been developed that analyze SPs. One group of bioinformatic approaches integrated the analysis of transcriptome-wide data with the models employing the mass action law and Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics [13]. However, these methods, which have developed during the last fifteen years, remained purely fundamental until recently, primarily because of the multiplicity of interaction domains in the signal transducer proteins that enormously increase the interactome complexity [14]. Secondly, a considerable number of unknown free parameters, such as kinetics constants and/or concentrations of protein molecules, significantly complicated the SPA analysis. Yizhak et al. (2013) suggested that the clinical efficiency of several drugs, e.g., geroprotectors, may be evaluated as the ability to induce the kinetic models of the pathways into the steady state [13]. However, protein\u2013protein interactions were quantitatively characterized in detail only for a tiny fraction of SPs. This approach is also time-consuming, since to process each transcriptomic dataset, it requires extensive calculations for the kinetic models [13].",
                "In addition, all the contemporary bioinformatical methods that were proposed for digesting large-scale gene expression data, followed by recognition and analysis of SPs, have an important disadvantage: they do not allow tracing the overall pathway activation signatures and quantitively estimate the extent of the SPA [13,15]. This may be due to a lack of the definition of the specific roles of the individual gene products in the overall signal transduction process, incorporated in the calculation matrix used to estimate the SPA.",
                "Thus, there remains an unmet, urgent and increasing need to provide effective personalized non-toxic disease therapies, as well as models for selecting a personalized optimal therapy for an individual.",
                "Here, we propose a method for quick, informative and large-scale screening of changes in SPA in cells and tissues. These changes may reflect various conditions, such as differences in physiological state, aging, disease, treatment with drugs, media composition, additives, etc. One of the potential applications of SPA studies may be to utilize mathematical algorithms to identify and rank the medicines based on their predicted efficacy. In this paper, we give examples of the analysis of transcriptomics data for three sets of experiments involving the analysis of the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis extracts. Such a method can potentially be used for the detection of the efficiency of various other botanical extracts or single compounds, although the versatility of the method will have to be confirmed using other data sets."

The quality of the sequencing reads was assessed using FastQC v0.11.5 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The base qualities were over 30 on the Phred scale across all of the samples and no adapter contamination was noted. The reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37, Ensembl) downloaded from the Illumina iGenomes repository (https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html). The mapping was done using HISAT v2.0.5 [32] with the following command \u201chisat2-q\u2014rna-strandness R\u2014phred33-p 20\u2014known-splicesite <known_splice_sites> -x <index> -U <fastq> -S <sam>\u201d.

In the first experiment, we have used the data from human EpiDermFT 3D skin tissues exposed to UVC to induce inflammation and then treated with extracts of several cannabis cultivars. In the second experiment, human EpiOral tissues were treated with TNF\u03b1 to induce inflammation and then treated with several different extracts. In the third experiment, human EpiIntestinal tissues were treated with TNF\u03b1 and then treated with several different extracts.",

The minimum mapping rate, calculated as a fraction of reads with at least one match to the genome, was at least 93.80% with a median of 97.65%. The fraction of mapped reads assigned to features (genes) was in the range of 72.93\u201376.00% with a median of 74.86%.",

Analysis of the samples from the first experiment revealed that Extract #8 is the most efficient extract in restoring the transcriptome response after the UVC exposure (Table 3). Extract #4 was less efficient, whereas Extract #13 was not efficient. Extract #12 was actually harmful as it has increased the UVC-induced changes in the transcriptome.",
                "In the second experiment, inflammation in 3D EpiOral tissues was established using exposure to TNF\u03b1 (40 ng/mL) (Table 4). The effect of the extracts on the reversal of the inflammation processes was evaluated using the CDEI.",
                "Ranking of the CDEI scores revealed that Extract #3 was the most efficient; it has restored the TNF-induced transcriptome nearly completely\u2014with a CDEI score of 0.98. Extracts #5, #9 and #2 were also quite efficient, with CDEI scores of 0.90, 0.88 and 0.87, respectively. Extracts #8 and #4 were not very efficient, with CDEI scores of 0.10 and 0.16, respectively.",
                "Finally, in the 3rd experiment, EpiIntestinal tissues were exposed to TNF\u03b1 and several extracts were used to reverse the transcriptome changes (Table 5). The CDEI score showed that Extract #5 was the most efficient, followed by Extract #6.",

For example, a comparison of extracts for the reduction of inflammation in EpiOral and EpiIntestinal tissues showed that Extract #115 was equally and highly effective, while Extract #167 was not (Figure 4). At the same time, Extracts #7, #9 and #169 were effective for EpiOral tissues but not for EpiIntestinal tissues (Figure 4). Our attempts to correlate the level of cannabinoids and the efficiency of the extracts did not show any correlation. This is perhaps not surprising, as other molecules in the extracts likely have a strong modulatory effect.",

The correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between the CBD level and CDEI score (0.49) and a strong positive correlation between the CBN level and CDEI score (0.61). No correlation was found between THC and CDEI, CBG and CDEI or the CBD to THC ratio and CDEI."

                "We developed a methodology to compute a cannabis drug efficiency index (CDEI) across the 241 pathways that contain the genes responding to the cannabis drug. The advantages of our methodology can be summarized as follows.",
                "CDEI explicitly calculates the drug efficiency of cannabis on diseases, using the expression values of the genes. As far as we understand, this is a novel methodology and there is no other methodology or software similar to CDEI to do it.",
                "CDEI evaluates the enrichment scores of the individual pathways in the control, untreated and treated cases. Then CDEI statistically integrates and compares the results from all samples. Finally, CDEI measures the overall drug efficiency of cannabis on diseases.",
                "An important characteristic of the CDEI calculation is that CDEI is not affected by the properties of the input data chosen. CDEI purely measures the efficacy of the cannabis drug by statistically comparing the cannabis-treated and untreated cases with the control.",
                "With the emergence of large-scale methods in genomics, the gene-level transcription changes became an obvious target in the search for biomarkers in complex diseases. Yet, in over a decade of research effort, only a handful of gene or protein biomarkers made its way into clinical practice. For example, as of 2017, 26 gene-based predictive and diagnostic biomarkers were used in cancer medicine [35]. Biomarker discovery based on gene expression signatures is challenging due to low reproducibility when presented with different datasets [36,37] and a high occurrence of stochastic associations [38]. As an alternative to a single gene or gene signature approach, methods that aggregate data across pathways or gene network modules are gaining traction, potentially being more effective tools for biomarker discovery [39,40,41]. Several studies demonstrated that the use of pathway-based biomarkers enables robust predictions of drug response [42,43] and accurate classification of disease types [44].",
                "Considering the importance of pathway analysis, multiple methods were developed to address the task. These methods can be roughly classified as non-topology-based and topology-based [45]. Non-topological methods treat pathways as non-structured lists of genes (gene sets); they take a list of differentially expressed (DE) genes and attempt to determine the probability of observing a given number of DE genes within a pathway. More sophisticated non-topological methods rely on the analysis of gene rankings in the whole dataset, avoiding the selection of target gene lists according to arbitrary thresholds. Topology-based methods take into account the biological reality of pathways by incorporating the data on the type and direction of protein interactions. Not surprisingly, topology-based methods were shown to outperform their counterparts in benchmarking tests [45].",
                "Recognizing the importance of pathway topology, CannSelect uses the SPIA algorithm to calculate pathway activation scores based on gene expression profiles. Previously, SPIA was shown to outperform other pathway analysis methods in terms of data aggregation [30] and in the ability to detect pathways, inducing a specific phenotype [45]. SPIA was also ranked third out of 10 methods used to generate pathway activation scores for machine learning classification in an iPanda benchmarking test [17].",
                "Estimation of pathway-level activities opens a possibility of selecting drugs or other bioactive compounds that could alter the physiological state of the system in the desired direction by changing the activities of perturbed pathways.",
                "This idea is at the core of several computational methods, including Oncofinder [1], GeroScope [46] and iPanda [17]; this is also true for the method presented in this study. Oncofinder is based on the unique computational algorithm that calculates pathway activation strength based on the activating or repressive actions of proteins in the pathway. Pathway activation strength reflects the activation or inhibition of the pathway in a pathological state compared to the healthy controls. It also incorporates the data on drug\u2013target interactions to predict the action of the drugs on specific pathways and rank the drugs based on a predicted efficiency score. The output of Oncofinder is a list of drugs ranked by the predicted efficiency meant to assist in selecting a treatment strategy for a specific patient. GeroScope is an extension of Oncofinder to analyze aging-related pathways and screen chemical compounds that act as geroprotectors. iPanda is a topology-based method that assigns importance coefficient to genes in a pathway derived using a combination of statistical and topological methods [17]. iPanda can be adapted to estimate drug scores following similar principles as in Oncofinder.",
                "In theory, the CDEI approach mechanistically resembles Oncofinder, Geroscope, or iPanda; however, it differs from them in terms of pathway score and drug score algorithms and, more importantly, it is designed with a different purpose in mind. Oncofinder and other similar methods require two conditions\u2014disease and normal state\u2014and serve to facilitate the selection of drugs that could act on pathways altered between these two conditions. The data can be obtained experimentally or downloaded from public repositories. CDEI, on the other hand, requires three conditions\u2014an untreated control (healthy state), pathological state, and pathological state treated with a drug of interest. The output of CDEI is a numerical measure of the ability of a drug to reverse gene expression changes in a pathological state to mimic those in the healthy control. In contrast to Oncofinder, CDEI is useful as a computational step that follows laboratory testing of panels of drugs or other bioactive compounds to select prospective candidates for further investigation.",
                "There are different methodologies to analyze the enrichment of individual pathways. GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) finds the enrichment of pathways by focusing on gene sets [47]. SPIA measures the perturbation score on pathways [26]. NEA (Network Enrichment Analysis) outputs the network enrichment scores of the altered gene sets per pathway [48]. However, these methodologies do not further derive an integrated meaningful result (i.e., a drug efficiency index) from the analysis of the individual pathways.",
                "As detailed in the accompanying manual of the software, CDEI provides a convenient graphical user interface software available to users. The CDEI software works on both Windows and Linux systems. It validates the user inputs of the gene expression values and computes the scores of the individual pathways as an intermediate output. Then the software generates the drug efficiency index of cannabis on diseases as the final output.",
                "One of the recent studies using the SPIA method was the report by Franco et al. (2019) [48]. The authors presented a method to identify the biomarkers of drug response and survival in proliferative disease using enrichment over the gene networks. Unlike the CDEI algorithm, it does not calculate drug scores that reflect the overall shift in pathway activity towards a normal (non-diseased) state; also, in their study, the SPIA scores were calculated for individual pathways and correlated with clinical variables of interest (drug response and survival). In the CDEI, the SPIA scores are weighted and summarized following a specific application of a drug screen to the individual sample, which allows a calculation of a drug score and the ranking of drugs by efficiency. In this, respect the CDEI is a tool that allows a selection of a drug for an individual patient. This functionality is not present in Franco\u2019s network approach [48].",
                "Pathway analysis has the potential to improve performance by applying machine learning methods. For example, the representative genes that represent a pathway can be selected by feature selection methods and pathways can be further ranked or weighted based on the representative genes using classification methods [49].",
                "To conclude, the CDEI algorithm represents a multistage process that includes the specific application of a drug screen, integration of pathway databases, weighted summarization of the pathway activation scores and identification of the most efficient drugs/extracts. The bioinformatics part of the CDEI process is wrapped into user-friendly graphical interface software. Currently, the CDEI algorithm was only used for the analysis of the efficacy of cannabis extracts in the reduction of inflammation. It remains to be shown whether it would also be able to rank the cannabis extracts (or extracts of any other medicinal herb or synthetic drug) by their efficacy for other molecular processes, diseases, or conditions. The CDEI algorithm may also be an efficient tool to stratify patients in the clinical studies or clinical trials by their response to a drug, thus providing selection criteria upon transition from Phase 2 to Phase 3 or Phase 4 clinical trials. It will also be very useful in pre-clinical experiments using various cell, tissue or animal models, like recently used analysis of the efficiency of cannabis extracts for the reduction of inflammation [50]."
