                        "In the twentieth century, enormous strides were made in combatting infectious diseases, in their detection and drugs to treat them. The major problem in the medical world has thus shifted from treating acute diseases to treating chronic diseases. Over the last few decades, with the advent of genetic engineering, much research and funding has been invested in genomics and gene-based personalized medicine. A need has arisen to develop diagnostic tools for use in the characterization of personalized aspects of chronic diseases.",
                        "Intracellular signaling pathways (SPs) regulate numerous processes involved in normal and pathological conditions including development, growth, aging and cancer. Many bioinformatics tools have been developed, which analyze SPs. Many intracellular signaling pathways or maps are available at online websites. Additionally, they can be found in publications, such as, but not limited to Cooper et al, 2000 and Krauss, 2008.",
                        "The information relating to signaling pathway activation (SPA) can be obtained from the massive proteomic or transcriptomic data. Although the proteomic level may be somewhat closer to the biological function of SPA, the transcriptomic level of studies today is far more feasible in terms of performing experimental tests and analyzing the data.",
                        "Intracellular signaling pathways (SPs) regulate numerous processes involved in normal and pathological conditions including development, growth, aging and cancer. Many bioinformatics tools have been developed recently that analyze SPs. However, none of them makes it possible to efficiently do the high-throughput quantification of pathway activation scores for the individual biological samples. Here we propose a method for quick, informative and large-scale screening of changes in signaling pathway activation (SPA) in cells and tissues. These changes may reflect various differential conditions like differences in physiological state, aging, disease, treatment with drugs, infections, media composition, additives, etc. One of the potential applications of SPA studies may be in utilizing mathematical algorithms to identify and rank the medicines based on their predicted efficacy.",
                        "The information about SPA can be obtained from the massive proteomic or transcriptomic data. Although the proteomic level may be somewhat closer to the biological function of SPA, the transcriptomic level of studies today is far more feasible in terms of performing experimental tests and analizing the data. The transcriptomic methods like Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or microarray analysis of RNA can routinely determine expression levels for all or virtually all human genes (Shirane, 2004). Transcriptome profiling may be performed for the minute amount of the tissue sample, not necessarily fresh, but also for the clinical formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. For the molecular analysis of cancer, gene expression can be interpreted in terms of abnormal SPA features of various pro- and antimitotic signaling pathways. Such analysis may improve further decision-making process of treatment strategy selection by the clinician.",
                        "Pro- and antimitotic SPs that determine various stages of cell cycle progression remained in the spotlight of the computational biologists for more than a decade (Kholodenko, 1999; Borisov, 2009; Kuzmina, 2011). Today, hundreds of SPs and related gene product interaction maps that show sophisticated relationships between the individual molecules, are catalogued in various databases like UniProt (The UniProt consortium, 2011), HPRD (Mathivanan, 2006), QIAGEN SABiosciences (SABiosciences), WikiPathways (Bauer-Mehren, 2009), Ariadne Pathway Studio (Nikitin, 2004), SPIKE (Elkon, 2008), Reactome (Haw, 2012), KEGG (Nakaya, 2013), etc.",
                        "One group of bioinformatic approaches integrated the analysis of transcriptome-wide data with the models employing the mass action law and Michaelis-Meten kinetics (Yizhak, 2013). These methods which were developing during last fifteen years, however, remained purely fundamental until recently, primarily, because of the multiplicity of interaction domains in the signal transducer proteins that enormously increase the interactome complexity (Borisov, 2008; Conzelman, 2006). Secondly, a considerable number of unknown free parameters, such as kinetics constants and/or concentrations of protein molecules, significantly complicated the SPA analysis. Yizhak et al. (2013) suggested that the clinical efficiency of several drugs, e.g. geroprotectors, may be evaluated as the ability to induce the kinetic models of the pathways into the steady state. However, protein-protein interactions were quantitatively characterized in detail only for a tiny fraction of SPs. This approach is also time-consuming since to process each transcriptomic dataset it requires extensive calculations for the kinetic models (Yizhak, 2013).",
                        "However, all the contemporary bioinformatical methods that were proposed for digesting large-scale gene expression data followed by recognition and analysis of SPs, have an important disadvantage. They do not allow tracing the overall pathway activation signatures and quantitively estimate the extent of SPA (Hwang, 2012; Kuzmina, 2011; Yizhak, 2013). This may be due to lack of the definition of the specific roles of the individual gene products in the overall signal transduction process, incorporated in the calculation matrix used to estimate SPA.",
                        "US2008254497A provides a method of determining whether tumor cells or tissue is responsive to treatment with an ErbB pathway-specific drug. In accordance with the invention, measurements are made on such cells or tissues to determine values for total ErbB receptors of one or more types, ErbB receptor dimers of one or more types and their phosphorylation states, and/or one or more ErbB signaling pathway effector proteins and their phosphorylation states. These quantities, or a response index based on them, are positively or negatively correlated with cell or tissue responsiveness to treatment with an ErbB pathway-specific drug. In one aspect, such correlations are determined from a model of the mechanism of action of a ErbB pathway-specific drug on an ErbB pathway. Preferably, methods of the invention are implemented by using sets of binding compounds having releasable molecular tags that are specific for multiple components of one or more complexes formed in ErbB pathway activation. After binding, molecular tags are released and separated from the assay mixture for analysis.",

No. 8,623,592 discloses methods for treating patients which methods comprise methods for predicting responses of cells, such as tumor cells, to treatment with therapeutic agents. These methods involve measuring, in a sample of the cells, levels of one or more components of a cellular network and then computing a Network Activation State (NAS) or a Network Inhibition State (NIS) for the cells using a computational model of the cellular network. The response of the cells to treatment is then predicted based on the NAS or NIS value that has been computed. The invention also comprises predictive methods for cellular responsiveness in which computation of a NAS or NIS value for the cells (e.g., tumor cells) is combined with use of a statistical classification algorithm. Biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to treatment with a therapeutic agent that targets a component within the ErbB signaling pathway are also provided.",
