                        "Mammalian blood vessels are composed of three layers: the adventitia, media and intima, and the intima is covered with a layer of vascular endothelial cells. The vascular endothelial cells release various types of vasoactive substances to control the contraction and expansion of blood vessels, and also protect blood vessels by preventing the adhesion and aggregation of platelets.",
                        "Examples of diseases in which vascular endothelial cells are involved include arteriosclerosis that begins with a decrease in the function of endothelial cells present in vascular intima. Endothelial dysfunction, namely, the loss of endothelial function, induces vascular diseases, such as for example, atherosclerosis. Vascular endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been suggested to be useful for therapeutic applications, and cases have been reported in which a revascularization therapy of transplanting autologous EPCs to patients with severe ischemic diseases including coronary artery diseases and lower limb ischemic diseases (such as Buerger's disease, obstructive arteriosclerosis, etc.) was performed to obtain favorable results (Non-patent Documents 1 and 2). The above described effect of improving ischemia has been confirmed to be dependent on the number of EPCs administered, and thus it is important to obtain and administer a larger amount of EPCs. However, the number and the function of EPCs obtained from autologous blood or bone marrow fluid of the patients are often decreased, and in such cases, a sufficient therapeutic effect cannot be obtained.",
                        "On the other hand, cells with pluripotency have hitherto been reported, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) which can be obtained by introducing undifferentiated cell-specific genes into embryonic stem cells (ES cells) or somatic cells (Patent Documents 1 and 2). These cells are drawing attention as useful materials, since they can be grown indefinitely, and there is a possibility that vascular endothelial cells for use in transplantation therapy can be obtained by applying a differential stimulus to these cells.",

Further, the cells can be maintained by subculturing using a culture medium supplemented with a substance(s) such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

Induced pluripotent stem cells can be prepared by introducing specific reprogramming factors in the form of DNA or protein into somatic cells (K. Takahashi and S. Yamanaka (2006) Cell, 126: pp. 663 to 676; K. Takahashi et al. (2007), Cell, 131: pp. 861 to 872; J. Yu et al. (2007), Science, 318: pp. 1917 to 1920; Nakagawa, M. et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 26: pp. 101 to 106 (2008); and WO 2007/069666). The reprogramming factor may be a gene specifically expressed in ES cells, a gene which plays an important role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of ES cells, or a gene product thereof. Examples of combinations of genes which function as reprogramming factors include, but are not particularly limited to: OCT3/4, SOX2 and KLF4; OCT3/4, KLF4 and C-MYC; OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC; OCT3/4 and SOX2; OCT3/4, SOX2 and NANOG; OCT3/4, SOX2 and LIN28; OCT3/4 and KLF4; and the like.",

Alternatively, they can be introduced into somatic cells in the form of DNA, for example, by a method such as the use of a vector, for example, a virus, a plasmid or an artificial chromosome; lipofection; the use of liposome; or microinjection. Examples of the virus vector include retrovirus vectors, lentivirus vectors (both are described in Cell, 126, pp. 663 to 676, 2006; Cell, 131, pp. 861 to 872, 2007; and Science, 318, pp. 1917 to 1920, 2007), adenovirus vectors (Science, 322, pp. 945 to 949, 2008), adeno-associated virus vectors and Sendai virus vectors. Examples of the artificial chromosome vector include human artificial chromosome (HAC) vectors, yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC, PAC) vectors. Examples of the plasmid which may be used include plasmids for use in mammalian cells (Science, 322: pp. 949 to 953, 2008). The vector may contain a regulatory sequence(s) such as a promoter, an enhancer, a ribosome binding sequence, a terminator and/or a polyadenylation site so as to enable the expression of nuclear reprogramming factors. If necessary, the vector may also contain a sequence of a selectable marker such as a drug resistance gene (for example, kanamycin resistance gene, ampicillin resistance gene, or puromycin resistance gene), a thymidine kinase gene, or a diphtheria toxin gene; or a sequence of a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) or FLAG. Further, in order to delete, after the introduction of the above vector into somatic cells, the genes encoding the reprogramming factors, or both the promoters and the genes encoding the reprogramming factors linked thereto, the vector may include LoxP sequences upstream and downstream of these sequences.",

Biotechnol., 26 (7): pp. 795 to 797 (2008)), trichostatin A, sodium butyrate, MC 1293 and M344; and nucleic acid expression inhibitors such as siRNAs and shRNAs against HDAC (e.g., HDAC1 siRNA Smartpool (registered trademark; Millipore), HuSH 29mer shRNA Constructs against HDAC1 (OriGene)) and the like]; DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (such as 5\u2032-azacytidine) (Nat.

(2009), PLoS One. 4: e8067 or WO2010/137746); and a method in which an extracellular matrix (such as Laminin-5 (WO2009/123349) or Matrigel (BD Biosciences)) is used instead.",

Further, iPS cells can be selected: by observation under a fluorescence microscope in the case of using a fluorescent protein gene as a marker gene; by addition of a luminescent substrate in the case of using a luminescent enzyme gene as a marker gene, and by addition of a chromogenic substrate in the case of using a chromogenic enzyme gene as a marker gene.",

The expression \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as used herein means that the HLA genotype of the cells to be transplanted matches with that of the individual to be transplanted with the cells, to the extent that the immune reaction against the transplanted cells can be suppressed by an immunosuppressant.

Specifically, colonies of the pluripotent stem cells were seeded on a plate coated with GFR-Matrigel, at a density of 2 colonies/cm2, followed by culturing in mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL TECHNOLOGIES). The cells were allowed to grow until the diameters of the colonies were about 750 p.m, and then the medium was replaced with mTeSR1 medium containing 20 ng/mL of BMP4 (R&D systems), followed by culturing for three days (corresponds to Day 3 in FIG. 1).

An anti-human KDR antibody (Biolegend), an anti-human CD34 antibody (Beckman coulter), and an anti-human VE-cadherin antibody (eBioscience) were each diluted at 1:100 before use. As a result, the expression of KDR/CD34NE-cadherin was observed in about 10% of the cells (FIG. 2).",

After washing twice with Perm/Wash, the secondary antibody reaction (FITC-labeled anti-sheep IgG antibody, Jackson immunoresearch, 1:100) was allowed to proceed at room temperature for one hour. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with Perm/Wash, and imaged by a fluorescence microscope (Keyence). As a result, the expression of CD31, which is a marker of vascular endothelial cells, and Ac-LDL uptake, which is one of the functions of vascular endothelial cells, were observed (FIG. 3).

Thus, for the purpose of eliminating the intercellular interaction which had been formed by Day 3, the cells were treated with TrypLE Express (Life Technologies) at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes to be dissociated into single cells, after being cultured with BMP/Matrigel and immediately before being stimulated with VEGF. The resulting single cells were allowed to differentiate again by plate culture (VEGF/Matrigel).

Therefore, induction of differentiation was carried out using second matrix plates coated with various types of single matrix proteins (from Day 3 to Day 7), in order to search for a matrix which allows for the induction into vascular endothelial cells at a high purity, and in a stable manner across the cell lines. The method for differentiation induction is shown in FIG. 6. As a result, it has been demonstrated that vascular endothelial cells can be induced at a high purity in each of the cell lines, in the case of using a non-coated plate (non-coating) and a plate coated with LM411. (FIG. 7). On the other hand, in the case of using LM511, which has been considered to be useful for the maintenance of pluripotent stem cells, a decrease in the purity was observed in some of the cell lines. Further, the comparison of the yields of the obtained vascular endothelial cells revealed that the use of LM411 provided a higher yield.",

Further, a subsequent clustering analysis has revealed that the cells differentiated by using LM411E8 have a gene expression profile different from those differentiated under the non-coating condition and those differentiated by using LM411. In particular, it has been confirmed that the gene expression related to the response to the stimulation by VEGF and to angiogenesis are enhanced by the use of LM411E8.",

Therefore, the adhesion activities of the mesodermal progenitor cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation to the non-coated plate (non-coating), the plate coated with LM411 or the plate coated with LM411E8 were compared. As a result, the cell adhesion to LM411E8 was markedly higher as compared to the other two.",

Therefore, the mesodermal progenitor cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation were subjected to a cell adhesion assay, using a neutralizing antibody against integrin \u03b16\u03b21. As a result, the number of adhered cells decreased almost to the same degree as that of the cells differentiated under the non-coating condition. LM411E8 (EQ) is a variant of LM411E8 which has lost its avidity for integrin \u03b16\u03b21 due to the glutamic acid at the third position from the C terminus of the y chain being substituted with glutamine. The avidity for the above described LM411E8 (EQ) of the mesodermal progenitor cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation was evaluated, and the results indicated that the avidity was almost the same as that of the cells differentiated under the non-coating condition. Based on the above results, the initial adhesion to LM411E8 of the mesodermal progenitor cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation is thought to be dependent on integrin \u03b16\u03b21.",

In the double-switching assay, the mesodermal progenitor cells obtained on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation using BMP4/Matrigel were dissociated into single cells and then seeded on a plate coated with LM411, and the cells adhered thereto were subcultured again on Matrigel (MG) or LM411. As a result, the use of LM411-MG resulted in a significant decrease in the purity as compared to the case of using LM411-LM411 (FIG. 13). Based on the above, it is thought that LM411 is not only responsible for selecting the cells in a receptor specific manner, but also has an impact on the subsequent vascular endothelial differentiation of the cells adhered thereto. Further, in order to investigate whether LM411E8 has a function to induce vascular endothelial differentiation by itself, the mesodermal progenitor cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation were cultured on LM411E8 without VEGF. As a result, no induction to vascular endothelial cells was observed.

When carrying out the sequencing, the mesodermal progenitor cells (Day 3) which had been differentiated from the pluripotent stem cells using BMP4/Matrigel were dissociated into single cells, and then differentiated on Matrigel or LM411E8. The gene expression was compared between the cells on Day 5 and Day 7 after the induction of differentiation at the single cell level (FIG. 14). A principal component analysis was performed to reveal that, although the gene expression varied relatively during the period of from Day 0 to Day 3 after the induction of differentiation, the cells re-seeded on LM411E8 formed a homogeneous population. On the other hand, the heterogeneity in the gene expression did not improve in the cells differentiated on Matrigel. The above results have demonstrated that LM411E8 functions as a guide to restrict the gene expression profile, in the determination of the destiny of the cells, also in terms of gene expression profile. Further, the vascular endothelial cells obtained by using LM411E8 or Matrigel, on Day 5 after the induction of differentiation, were subjected to a microarray analysis to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

The results of Single cell RNA-sequencing have shown that the increase in AXIN2, which is a known reporter gene for Wnt signaling, was not uniform at the single cell level in the cells on Day 3 after the induction of differentiation. This revealed that the endogenous activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was not sufficient in the early differentiation. Based on the results of Single cell RNA-sequencing, it was thought that the use of a conventional method results in an uneven activation of endogenous Wnt signaling in the early differentiation, and accordingly, that it may be possible to increase the number of the cells which adhere to LM411E8 and thus differentiate into vascular endothelial cells, by uniformly activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by the use of CHIR99021. Further, it was also thought that it may be possible to successively enhance the differentiation from the mesodermal progenitor cells expressing KDR to vascular endothelial cells, by adding VEGF in the early stages of differentiation.",
                                "Therefore, the pluripotent stem cells were seeded on a plate coated with LM511E8 fragment at a density of 5 colonies/cm2 and then cultured in mTeSR1 medium. The cells were allowed to grow until the diameters of the colonies were 750 \u03bcm, and then the medium was replaced with Essential 8 (Life Technologies) medium containing 4 \u03bcm CHIR99021 (Wako), 80 ng/mL of BMP4 and 80 ng/mL of VEGF, to initiate the induction of differentiation (FIG. 15). On day 2 after the start of the differentiation induction, the cells were dissociated into single cells by treating the cells with TrypLE Express at 37\u00b0 C. for 20 minutes, and the resulting cells were suspended in Stempro-34 medium containing 80 ng/mL of VEGF, seeded on a plate coated with LM411E8 at a density of 4\u00d7104 cells/cm2, and cultured for four days.",
                                "As a result, it has been shown that the mesodermal progenitor cells induced under the improved early differentiation conditions, as described above, are also compatible with the culture system in which LM411E8 was used as the second matrix, and that it is possible to induce vascular endothelial cells at a high purity (the images on the left in FIG. 16), and to induce ten or more vascular endothelial cells from one pluripotent stem cell (the graph on the right in FIG. 16). Further, these endothelial cells were also confirmed to have functions to form cord-like structures (tube formation) and to incorporate Ac-LDL (FIG. 17).",

                                "The induced vascular endothelial cells obtained as described above were suspended at a density of 1\u00d7107cells/mL, in Matrigel supplemented with bFGF (Wako) to a concentration of 300 ng/mL. A quantity of 100 \u03bcL of the resulting suspension was injected subcutaneously to the back of an NOG mouse (around 6 week-old) (Nakahara M, et al, cloning and stem cells, 11: pp. 509 to 522, 2009). The Matrigel was taken on Day 21 after the transplantation, and analyzed by immunofluorescent staining. Specifically, the Matrigel was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako) at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. Subsequently, the paraformaldehyde was replaced with a 20% sucrose solution at 4\u00b0 C. overnight, and frozen embedded using an O.C.T. compound. The resultant was cut into a section having a thickness of 6 \u03bcm, and the section was allowed to adsorb onto a glass slide. After drying, the section was fixed by treating with Cytofix at room temperature for five minutes. Thereafter, the section was incubated using Perm/Wash at room temperature for 30 minutes to enhance the permeability, and an antibody reaction was carried out. A sheep anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:10), a mouse anti-human nuclear antibody (Millipore, 1:100), and a rat Alexa fluor 647-labeled anti-mouse TER-119 antibody (BD Biosciences, 1:10), as primary antibodies, were dissolved in Perm/Wash, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for two hours. For the secondary antibody reaction, an anti-sheep IgG antibody (Jackson immunoresearch, 1:100) and an anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson immunoresearch, 1:100) were dissolved in Perm/Wash, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for one hour. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS, fluoview).",
                                "As a result, it has been confirmed that the vascular endothelial cells induced by the present method have formed a luminal structure in vivo, and mouse erythrocytes are present in the lumens (FIG. 18). In other words, it has been shown that it is possible to induce functional vascular endothelial cells by the matrix switching method using LM411E8, also in vivo."
