The present invention provides a method for isolating and culturing neural stem cells with high efficiency, comprising the steps of adding brain tissue into an enzyme solution so as to subject the brain tissue to enzyme treatment; physically isolating cell clumps from the enzyme treated brain tissue by dividing the cell clumps according to size and removing impurities; and inoculating the cell clumps on a culture dish so as to subculture.",

                        "Biotechnology for the 21st century has suggested the possibility of new solutions to food, environmental and health problems with human welfare as the final goal, and recently, technology using stem cells is emerging as a new chapter in treatment of incurable diseases. Previously, organ transplantation or gene therapy was suggested to treat human incurable diseases, but was not effectively put to practical use because of rejection, shortages in supply of organs, poor delivery of vector or lack of adequate therapeutic genes.",
                        "Accordingly, with the growing interest in stem cell research, it was recognized that pluripotent stem cells capable of forming all organs through proliferation and differentiation can fundamentally solve organ damage as well as treat many incurable diseases. Stem cells refer to cells that can differentiate into two or more types of cells with self-renewability, and classified into totipotent stem cells, pluripotent stem cells and multipotent stem cells. Many scientists have suggested the applicability of stem cells in various ways including the treatment of incurable diseases such as Parkinson's disease, various types of cancer, diabetes and spinal cord injury, as well as regeneration of almost all human organs.",
                        "Neural stem cells, that is stem cells that can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, were first found in the rodent, mice. Afterward, it was known that neural stem cells are present in the human brain, and involved in brain regeneration throughout one's life. Therefore, for treatment of degenerative neurological diseases, recently, the development of a therapeutic agent using neural stem cells is attracting attention.",
                        "In the beginning of human neural stem cell research, neural stem cells were isolated from a fetal brain and cultured. Based on those researches, recently, clinical trials for treating stroke or spinal cord injury have been conducted. In addition, research on isolating and culturing neural stem cells from embryonic stem cells has been undertaken. Recently, a method for differentiation into neural stem cells from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been studied, and there is an increasing expectation of culture of neural stem cells that enable autologous transplantation.",
                        "However, neural stem cells derived from a fetus or embryonic stem cells have ethical problems and concerns about tumorigenic safety. In addition, since iPS cell-derived neural stem cells also have problems with tumorigenic safety, for clinical application of these stem cells, there was a need for verification of biological safety. In previous research, for isolation and culture of neural stem cells, a method for isolating and culturing single cells from brain tissue has been widely used.",
                        "However, a method of isolating and culturing neural stem cells, which includes single cell isolation using Percoll, took a long time, and has a problem with the acquisition yield of neural stem cells."
