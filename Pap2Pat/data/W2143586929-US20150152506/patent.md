# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to the diagnosis or the prognosis of metastasis, in particular bone metastasis, in lung cancer based on determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified in a primary tumor sample. Likewise, the invention also relates to a method for the diagnosis or the prognosis of metastasis in lung cancer, in particular bone metastasis, as well as to a method for designing a customized therapy in a subject with lung cancer, which comprises determining the c-MAF gene expression level. Finally, the invention relates to the use of a c-MAF inhibitor as therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer metastasis, in particular bone metastasis.

2. Background Art

Metastasis, a complex process caused by elaborate interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding normal tissues in different vital organs, accounts for 90 percent of all cancer deaths in patients with solid tumors. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead primary tumors to form metastases must be understood in order to better address this major life-threatening problem. The identification of metastasis genes and mechanisms is essential for understanding the basic biology of this lethal condition and its implications for clinical practice. Previous work provided a sense of the complexity of the metastasis process, but it failed to explain how and why metastasis occurs, what mechanisms make metastasis a tissue-specific process, what events allow dormant metastases to become active and lethal many years after removal of a primary tumor, and what metastasis-mediating genes would eventually constitute worthy diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.

### Lung Bone-Specific Metastasis

Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung in a process called metastasis into nearby tissue and, eventually, into other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas that derive from epithelial cells. Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.3 million deaths annually, as of 2004. The most common symptoms are shortness of breath, coughing (including coughing up blood), and weight loss.

Lung cancers consist of four major types of lung cancer and multiple minor or rare forms. For clinico-pathological reasons they are often divided into the broad categories of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), also called oat cell cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC is further divided into three major types, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinomas. Because large cell carcinomas might represent poorly or undifferentiated forms of the other types of cancers, it is a vaguely defined entity, and criteria for its diagnosis vary widely. The most common cause of lung cancer is long-term exposure to tobacco smoke. Nonsmokers account for 15% of lung cancer cases, and these cases are often attributed to a combination of genetic factors, radon gas, asbestos, and air pollution including secondhand smoke.

Similar to many other cancers, lung cancer is initiated by activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenes are genes that are believed to make people more susceptible to cancer. Proto-oncogenes are believed to turn into oncogenes when exposed to particular carcinogens. Mutations in the K-ras proto-oncogene are responsible for 10-30% of lung adenocarcinomas. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion. Mutations and amplification of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung cancer and provide the basis for treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. Her2/neu is affected less frequently. Chromosomal damage can lead to loss of heterozygosity. This can cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Damage to chromosomes 3p, 5q, 13q, and 17p are particularly common in small-cell lung carcinoma. The p53 tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p, is affected in 60-75% of cases. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified are c-MET, NKX2-1, LKB1, PIK3CA, and BRAF.

Several genetic polymorphisms are associated with lung cancer. These include polymorphisms in genes coding for interleukin-1, cytochrome P450, apoptosis promoters such as caspase-8, and DNA repair molecules such as XRCC1. People with these polymorphisms are more likely to develop lung cancer after exposure to carcinogens.

**Classification**

Lung cancers are classified according to histological type. This classification has important implications for clinical management and prognosis of the disease. The vast majority of lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. The two most prevalent histological types of lung carcinoma, categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope, are non-small-cell and small-cell lung carcinoma. The non-small-cell type is the most prevalent by far.

Cancer found outside of the lung may be determined to have arisen within the lung, as lung cancers that metastasize, i.e. spread, often retain a cell marker profile that allow a pathologist to say, with a good deal of certainty, that the tumor arose from the lung, i.e. is a primary lung cancer. Primary lung cancers of adenocarcinoma histology typically have nuclear immunostaining with TTF-1.

**Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma**

The non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) are grouped together because their prognosis and management are similar. There are three main sub-types: squamous cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell lung carcinoma.

Accounting for 25% of lung cancers, squamous cell lung carcinoma usually starts near a central bronchus. A hollow cavity and associated necrosis are commonly found at the center of the tumor. Well-differentiated squamous cell lung cancers often grow more slowly than other cancer types.

Adenocarcinoma accounts for 40% of non-small-cell lung cancers. It usually originates in peripheral lung tissue. Most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking; however, among people who have never smoked (“never-smokers”), adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have different responses to treatment.

**Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma**

Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is less common. It was formerly referred to as “oat-cell” carcinoma. Most cases arise in the larger airways (primary and secondary bronchi) and grow rapidly, becoming quite large. The small cells contain dense neurosecretory granules (vesicles containing neuroendocrinehormones), which give this tumor an endocrine/paraneoplastic syndrome association. While initially more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation, it is often metastatic at presentation, and ultimately carries a worse prognosis. Small-cell lung cancers have long been dichotomously staged into limited and extensive stage disease. This type of lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking.

**Prognosis**

Prognostic factors in non-small-cell lung cancer include presence or absence of pulmonary symptoms, tumor size, cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and vascular invasion. For patients with inoperable disease, prognosis is adversely affected by poor performance status and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small-cell lung cancer include performance status, gender, stage of disease, and involvement of the central nervous system or liver at the time of diagnosis.

For non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), prognosis is generally poor. Following complete surgical resection of stage IA disease, five-year survival is 67%. With stage IB disease, five-year survival is 57%. The five-year survival rate of patients with stage IV NSCLC is about 1%.

For small-cell lung carcinoma, prognosis is also generally poor. The overall five-year survival for patients with SCLC is about 5%. Patients with extensive-stage SCLC have an average five-year survival rate of less than 1%. The median survival time for limited-stage disease is 20 months, with a five-year survival rate of 20%.

According to data provided by the National Cancer Institute, the median age at diagnosis of lung cancer in the United States is 70 years, and the median age at death is 72 years. In the US, people with medical insurance are more likely to have a better outcome.

**Metastasis**

Primary lung cancers themselves most commonly metastasize to the adrenal glands, liver, brain, and bone.

Skeletal metastasis occurs in advanced-stage lung cancer and they confer a high level of morbidity. At first diagnosis of bone metastasis disease therapeutic intervention will usually involve systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and bisphophonates, which are mostly palliative options with the intention of reducing pain.

In healthy skeletal bone, an equal balance of new bone matrix formation and old bone matrix resorption is achieved via coordinated activity of bone-degrading osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. During metastasis bone disease, the normal balance of bone resorption and formation is disrupted by the homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interactions that occur between invading tumor cells, osteoblasts and ostoclasts. Most patients with secondary bone tumors—including those associated with lung cancer present with osteolytic lesions. Therefore, most treatment strategies in current use or under evaluation in metastasis bone disease have been designed to protect the bone matrix from increased bone degrading activity of osteoclasts. Bone metastasis osteolytic lesions of the lung are a common feature with those of the breast, as opposed to prostate cancer. In the latter, an additional complication present in castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastasis bone disease are osteosclerotic lesions—also known as bone-forming or osteoblastic lesions- or a combination of both, osteolytic and osteosclerotic lesions—also referred to as mixed lesions. Osteosclerotic lesions are typified by bone deposits with multiple layers of poorly organized type-I collagen fibrils that have a woven appearance and reduced mechanical strength. Based on the common phenotypic features of lung and breast cancer bone metastasis is likely that the process underlines similar molecular mechanisms.

Lung cancer cells preserve, among each subtype, genome-aberration-induced transcriptional changes with high fidelity. The resulting dominant genes will reveal molecular events that predict the metastatic outcome despite the existence of substantial genomic, transcriptional, translational, and biological heterogeneity in the overall system. However, it is unknown whether the developmental history of a cancer would result in different or common mediators of site-specific metastasis. Predisposing factors related to the cell of origin may engender different rate-limiting barriers during metastatic progression. The present patent aims to set the stage for a detailed new prognostic factor to predict metastasis to the bone and their potential value as a therapeutic target.

The fact that most of the patients with solid tumor cancer die after metastasis means that it is crucial to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms allowing a tumor to metastasize. Recent publications have demonstrated how the metastasis is caused by means of complex yet little known mechanisms and also how the different metastatic cell types have a tropism towards specific organs. These tissue specific metastatic cells have a series of acquired functions allowing them to colonize specific organs.

However, there are no genetic markers, in the state of the art, which allow the diagnosis and/or the prognosis of whether a patient who suffers a specific lung cancer, such as NSCLC lung cancer, will or will not suffer metastasis, thus a suitable therapy being able to be applied to the subject suffering said cancer. Therefore, there is the need of identifying new markers which allow diagnosing the presence of metastasis in subjects suffering lung cancer and/or predicting the probability of a subject suffering lung cancer to develop metastasis, in particular bone metastasis. The identification of new prognosis factors will serve as a guide in selecting the most suitable treatments.

Identification of markers that predict bone metastasis would provide a preventive therapeutic opportunity by imposing restrictions to the spreading and colonization of bone metastatic tissue by lung cells and delay or transform a lethal condition. The inventors identified c-MAF and 16q22-24 genomic gain, as a bona fide associated lung cancer bone metastasis gene and genomic alteration, in a preferred embodiment osteolytic prostate bone metastasis.

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present inventors have determined that identifying the balance of signals that affect disseminated lung cancer cell metastasis, in particular bone metastasis, would provide valuable information to establish the prognosis of, and for preventive therapeutic intervention against, the disease. The inventors identified MAF and the 16q22-24 genomic gain as playing a role in driving lung-to-bone metastasis lesions, in particular osteolytic bone metastasis.

The present inventors have identified c-MAF as a marker associated with a greater tendency of lung cancer to cause metastasis and, particularly, bone metastasis. MAF overexpression appears to be due to an amplification of the locus 16q22-q24 in which the c-MAF gene is located.

c-MAF expression levels were studied in two patient cohorts. The first cohort contained the expression profiles and the clinical notes of primary tumors from patients with lung cancer. The second patient cohort was in the form of a tissue microarray composed of lung primary tumor biopsies, including 9 tumors that developed metastasis to the bone, 16 tumors that developed metastasis to other sites except bone and had a minimum clinical follow up of 5 years and 49 lung primary tumors that never developed metastasis with a minimum clinical follow up of 5 years, the c-MAF gene (mRNA) and protein expression in tumor cells and biopsy correlates positively with different clinical parameters, included the recurrence, metastasis, bone metastasis and overall survival being observed. Furthermore, these studies showed the role of c-MAF as marker for prognosis and as a target gene in lung cancer metastasis, particularly bone metastasis. Likewise, the inventors have associated the amplification of the locus 16q22-q24, including the c-MAF gene, with the presence of metastasis, in particular bone metastasis, in subjects with lung cancer.

Thus, in a first aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for the diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer and/or the prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis, in particular bone metastasis, in a subject with lung cancer, which comprises:


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level or 16q22-24 copy
  number gain in a tumor sample of said subject; and
- (ii) comparing the expression level or copies previously obtained with
  the expression level of said gene in a control sample;  
  wherein if the expression level of said gene is increased or genomic
  region amplified with respect to the expression level of said gene in
  the control sample, then said subject has a positive diagnosis for
  metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis, in particular
  bone metastasis.

In a second aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for designing a customized therapy for a subject with lung cancer, which comprises:


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level or 16q22-24 copy
  number gain in a tumor sample of said subject; and
- (ii) comparing the expression level previously obtained with the
  expression level of said gene in a control sample;  
  wherein if the expression level is increased or 16q22-24 copy number
  gained with respect to the expression level of said gene in the
  control sample, then said subject is susceptible to receive a therapy
  aiming to prevent an/or treat the metastasis. In a particular aspect
  of this method, the subject is then administered at least one therapy
  that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. If the
  expression level is not increased or 16q22-24 copy number is not
  gained with respect to said reference value, then said subject is not
  susceptible to receive a therapy aiming to prevent, inhibit and/or
  treat the bone metastasis. In a particular aspect of this method, the
  subject is then not administered at least one therapy that prevents,
  inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. In some aspects, the
  reference value is the c-MAF gene expression level in a sample of lung
  cancer from a subject who has not suffered metastasis. In some
  aspects, the lung cancer is SCL. In some embodiments, the lung cancer
  is NSCLC. In some aspects, the lung cancer is lung adenocarcinoma.

In a third aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for designing a customized therapy for a subject with lung cancer with bone metastasis, which comprises:


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level or 16q22-24 copy
  number gain in a bone metastatic tumor sample of said subject; and
- (ii) comparing the expression level obtained in step (i) with the
  expression level of said gene in a control sample;  
  wherein if the c-MAF gene expression level or 16q22-24 copy number
  gain is increased with respect to the expression level of said gene in
  the control sample, then said subject is susceptible to receive a
  therapy aiming to prevent the bone degradation. In a particular aspect
  of this method, the subject is then administered at least one therapy
  that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. If the
  c-MAF gene expression level is not increased or 16q22-24 copy number
  is not gained with respect to said reference value, then said subject
  is not susceptible to receive a therapy for preventing the bone
  degradation. In a particular aspect of this method, the subject is
  then not administered at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits
  and/or treats the bone metastasis.

In a fourth aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for the diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer and/or for the prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified or translocated in a tumor tissue sample of said subject; wherein if said gene is amplified with respect to a control sample, then said subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis. In a particular aspect of this method, the subject is then administered at least one therapy that prevents or inhibits the bone metastasis. In a particular aspect of this method, if the c-MAF gene is not amplified or translocated in a tumor tissue sample of said subject, the subject is then not administered at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. In a particular aspect, an above average expression level of the c-MAF is indicative of an increased risk of bone metastasis and this risk is proportional to the levels of c-MAF expression. In a particular aspect, if the expression level of the c-MAF is above the average plus one standard deviation with respect to the average level, then it can be concluded that said subject has a greater tendency to develop early bone metastasis.

In another aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for predicting the clinical outcome of a patient suffering lung cancer, which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified in a sample of said subject relative to a reference gene copy number wherein an amplification of the c-MAF gene with respect to said reference gene copy number is indicative of a poor clinical outcome. In a particular aspect of this method, the subject is then administered at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. If such amplification is not observed then the subject is then not administered at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis. In another embodiment of the seventh aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for predicting the clinical outcome of a patient suffering lung cancer which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is translocated in a sample of said subject wherein a translocation of the c-MAF gene (e.g. t(14,16)) is indicative of a poor clinical outcome. In some embodiments, the invention relates to designing a customized therapy for patients with the amplification or translocation of c-MAF. In some embodiments, the customized therapy is at least one therapeutic drug that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Methods for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Lung Cancer Metastasis Based on c-MAF Expression Levels

The inventors have identified that the c-MAF gene and protein is overexpressed in lung cancer metastasis, and that the c-MAF expression levels in primary lung tumors are correlated to different clinical parameters of lung cancer, particularly with recurrence and metastasis probability. Thus, c-MAF overexpression is correlated with the onset of lung tumor metastasis in bone. Therefore, c-MAF can be used as a marker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of metastasis, in particular bone metastasis, in a subject with lung cancer.

Thus in one aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for the diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer and/or for the prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer (hereinafter first method of the invention) which comprises


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor sample
  (e.g., lung tumor tissue, circulating lung tumor cell, circulating
  lung tumor DNA) from said subject and
- (ii) comparing the expression level previously obtained with the
  expression level of said gene in a control sample,  
  wherein if the expression levels of said gene are increased with
  respect to the expression levels of said gene in the control sample,
  then said subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater
  tendency to develop metastasis, in a preferred site bone metastasis.

The c-MAF gene (v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue (avian) also known as MAF or MGC71685) is a transcription factor containing a leucine zipper which acts like a homodimer or a heterodimer. Depending on the DNA binding site, the encoded protein can be a transcriptional activator or repressor. The DNA sequence encoding c-MAF is described in the NCBI database under accession number NG—016440 (SEQ ID NO: 1). The coding sequence of c-MAF is set forth in SEQ ID NO:13. Two messenger RNA are transcribed from said DNA sequence, each of the which will give rise to one of the two c-MAF protein isoforms, the a isoform and the 1 isoform. The complementary DNA sequences for each of said isoforms are described, respectively, in the NCBI database under accession numbers NM—005360.4 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and NM—001031804.2 (SEQ ID NO: 3).

In the context of the present invention, “metastasis” is understood as the propagation of a cancer from the organ where it started to a different organ. It generally occurs through the blood or lymphatic system. When the cancer cells spread and form a new tumor, the latter is called a secondary or metastatic tumor. The cancer cells forming the secondary tumor are like those of the original tumor. If a lung cancer, for example, spreads (metastasizes) to the bone, the secondary tumor is formed of malignant lung cancer cells. The disease in the bone is metastatic lung cancer and not bone cancer. In a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, the metastasis is lung cancer which has spread (metastasized) to the bone.

In the present invention, “diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer” is understood as identifying a disease (metastasis) by means of studying its signs, i.e., in the context of the present invention by means of increased c-MAF gene expression levels (i.e., overexpression) in the lung cancer tumor tissue with respect to a control sample.

In the present invention “prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer” is understood as knowing based on the signs if the lung cancer that said subject has will metastasize in the future. In the context of the present invention, the sign is c-MAF gene overexpression in tumor tissue.

The method of the invention comprises in a first step quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor tissue sample from a subject.

In a preferred embodiment, the first method of the invention comprises quantifying only the c-MAF gene expression level as a single marker, i.e., the method does not involve determining the expression level of any additional marker.

As used herein, the term “subject” or “patient” refers to all animals classified as mammals and includes but is not limited to domestic and farm animals, primates and humans, for example, human beings, non-human primates, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, or rodents. Preferably, the subject is a human man or woman of any age or race.

The terms “poor” or “good”, as used herein to refer to a clinical outcome, mean that the subject will show a favourable or unfavourable outcome. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, such an assessment of the probability, although preferred to be, may not be correct for 100% of the subjects to be diagnosed. The term, however, requires that a statistically significant portion of subjects can be identified as having a predisposition for a given outcome. Whether a portion is statistically significant can be determined readily by the person skilled in the art using various well known statistic evaluation tools, e.g., determination of confidence intervals, p-value determination, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test, etc. Details are found in Dowdy and Wearden, Statistics for Research, John Wiley & Sons, New York 1983. Preferred confidence intervals are at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90% at least about 95%. The p-values are, preferably, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, or 0.0001 or less. More preferably, at least about 60 percent, at least about 70 percent, at least about 80 percent or at least about 90 percent of the subjects of a population can be properly identified by the method of the present invention.

In the present invention “tumor sample” is understood as the sample (e.g., tumor tissue, circulating tumor cell, circulating tumor DNA) originating from the primary lung cancer tumor. Said sample can be obtained by conventional methods, for example biopsy, using methods well known by the persons skilled in related medical techniques. The methods for obtaining a biopsy sample include splitting a tumor into large pieces, or microdissection, or other cell separating methods known in the art. The tumor cells can additionally be obtained by means of cytology through aspiration with a small gauge needle. To simplify sample preservation and handling, samples can be fixed in formalin and soaked in paraffin or first frozen and then soaked in a tissue freezing medium such as OCT compound by means of immersion in a highly cryogenic medium which allows rapid freezing.

As understood by the person skilled in the art, the gene expression levels can be quantified by measuring the messenger RNA levels of said gene or of the protein encoded by said gene.

For this purpose, the biological sample can be treated to physically or mechanically break up the tissue or cell structure, releasing the intracellular components into an aqueous or organic solution for preparing nucleic acids. The nucleic acids are extracted by means of commercially available methods known by the person skilled in the art (Sambroock, J., et al., “Molecular cloning: a Laboratory Manual”, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, N.Y., Vol. 1-3.)

Thus, the c-MAF gene expression level can be quantified from the RNA resulting from the transcription of said gene (messenger RNA or mRNA) or, alternatively, from the complementary DNA (cDNA) of said gene. Therefore, in a particular embodiment of the invention, the quantification of the c-MAF gene expression levels comprises the quantification of the messenger RNA of the c-MAF gene or a fragment of said mRNA, complementary DNA of the c-MAF gene or a fragment of said cDNA or the mixtures thereof.

Virtually any conventional method can be used within the scope of the invention for detecting and quantifying the mRNA levels encoded by the c-MAF gene or of the corresponding cDNA thereof. By way of non-limiting illustration, the mRNA levels encoded by said gene can be quantified using conventional methods, for example, methods comprising mRNA amplification and the quantification of said mRNA amplification product, such as electrophoresis and staining, or alternatively, by Southern blot and using suitable probes, Northern blot and using specific probes of the mRNA of the gene of interest (c-MAF) or of the corresponding cDNA thereof, mapping with S1 nuclease, RT-PCR, hybridization, microarrays, etc., preferably by means of real time quantitative PCR using a suitable marker. Likewise, the cDNA levels corresponding to said mRNA encoded by the c-MAF gene can also be quantified by means of using conventional techniques; in this case, the method of the invention includes a step for synthesizing the corresponding cDNA by means of reverse transcription (RT) of the corresponding mRNA followed by the amplification and quantification of said cDNA amplification product. Conventional methods for quantifying expression levels can be found, for example, in Sambrook et al., 2001. (cited ad supra).

In a particular embodiment, the c-MAF gene expression levels are quantified by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or a DNA or RNA array.

In addition, the c-MAF gene expression level can also be quantified by means of quantifying the expression levels of the protein encoded by said gene, i.e., the c-MAF protein (c-MAF) [NCBI, accession number 075444], or any functionally equivalent variant of the c-MAF protein. There are two c-MAF protein isoforms, the a isoform (NCBI, NP—005351.2) made up of 403 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 4) and the 3 isoform (NP—001026974.1) made up of 373 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 5). The c-MAF gene expression level can be quantified by means of quantifying the expression levels of any of the c-MAF protein isoforms. Thus, in a particular embodiment, the quantification of the levels of the protein encoded by the c-MAF gene comprises the quantification of the c-MAF protein.

In the context of the present invention, “functionally equivalent variant of the c-MAF protein” is understood as (i) variants of the c-MAF protein (SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 5) in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted by a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue), wherein such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) variants comprising an insertion or a deletion of one or more amino acids and having the same function as the c-MAF protein, i.e., to act as a DNA binding transcription factor. Variants of the c-MAF protein can be identified using methods based on the capacity of c-MAF for promoting in vitro cell proliferation as shown in international patent application WO2005/046731 (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor for blocking the transcription capacity of a reporter gene under the control of cyclin D2 promoter or of a promoter containing the c-MAF responsive region (MARE or c-MAF responsive element) in cells expressing c-MAF as described in WO2008098351 (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), or based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor for blocking reporter gene expression under the control of the IL-4 promoter in response to the stimulation with PMA/ionomycin in cells expressing NFATc2 and c-MAF as described in US2009048117A (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).

The variants according to the invention preferably have sequences similarity with the amino acid sequence of any of the c-MAF protein isoforms (SEQ ID NO: 4 or SEQ ID NO: 5) of at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99%. The degree of similarity between the variants and the specific c-MAF protein sequences defined previously is determined using algorithms and computer processes which are widely known by the persons skilled in the art. The similarity between two amino acid sequences is preferably determined using the BLASTP algorithm [BLAST Manual, Altschul, S., et al., NCBI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894, Altschul, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990)].

The c-MAF protein expression level can be quantified by any conventional method which allows detecting and quantifying said protein in a sample from a subject. By way of non-limiting illustration, said protein levels can be quantified, for example, by using antibodies with c-MAF binding capacity (or a fragment thereof containing an antigenic determinant) and the subsequent quantification of the complexes formed. The antibodies used in these assays may or may not be labeled. Illustrative examples of markers that can be used include radioactive isotopes, enzymes, fluorophores, chemiluminescence reagents, enzyme substrates or cofactors, enzyme inhibitors, particles, dyes, etc. There is a wide range of known assays that can be used in the present invention which use unlabeled antibodies (primary antibody) and labeled antibodies (secondary antibody); these techniques include Western-blot or Western transfer, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), RIA (radioimmunoassay), competitive EIA (competitive enzyme iminmunoassay), DAS-ELISA (double antibody sandwich ELISA), immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical techniques, techniques based on the use of protein microarrays or biochips including specific antibodies or assays based on colloidal precipitation in formats such as dipsticks. Other ways for detecting and quantifying said c-MAF protein include affinity chromatography techniques, ligand binding assays, etc. When an immunological method is used, any antibody or reagent that is known to bind to the c-MAF protein with a high affinity can be used for detecting the amount thereof. Nevertheless, the use of an antibody, for example, polyclonal sera, supernatants of hybridomas or monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, Fv, Fab, Fab′ and F(ab′)2, scFv, humanized diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, nanobodies, alphabodies, stapled peptides, cyclopeptides and antibodies. There are commercial anti-c-MAF protein antibodies on the market which can be used in the context of the present invention, such as for example antibodies ab427, ab55502, ab55502, ab72584, ab76817, ab77071 (Abcam plc, 330 Science Park, Cambridge CB4 0FL, United Kingdom), the 075444 monoclonal antibody (Mouse Anti-Human MAF Azide free Monoclonal antibody, Unconjugated, Clone 6b8) of AbD Serotec, etc. There are many commercial companies offering anti-c-MAF antibodies, such as Abnova Corporation, Bethyl Laboratories, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Bioworld Technology, GeneTex, etc.

In a particular embodiment, the c-MAF protein levels are quantified means of western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA or a protein array.

In another particular embodiment, the c-MAF protein levels are quantified from exosomes or circulating DNA. Exosomes are 40-100 nm membrane vesicles secreted by most cell types in vivo and in vitro. Exosomes form in a particular population of endosomes, called multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by inward budding into the lumen of the compartment. Upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane, these internal vesicles are secreted. Exosomes can be isolated from diverse cell lines or body fluids by several methods well known in the art (Théry C. et al., Curr Protoc Cell Biol. 2006 April; Chapter 3:Unit 3.22) (the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein). Several commercial kits are available for the isolation of exosomes such as ExoQuick™ or ExoTest™.

The first method of the invention comprises in a second step comparing the c-MAF gene expression level obtained in the tumor sample (including but not limited to a primary tumor biopsy, circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA) from the subject with the expression level of said gene in a control sample.

Once the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor tissue sample, a circulating tumor cell or circulating tumor DNA from a subject with lung cancer has been measured and compared with the control sample, if the expression level of said gene are increased with respect to its expression level in the control sample, then it can be concluded that said subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

The determination of the c-MAF gene expression level must be correlated with values of a control sample or reference sample. Depending on the type of tumor to be analyzed, the exact nature of the control sample may vary. Thus, in the event that a diagnosis is to be evaluated, then the reference sample is a tumor tissue sample from a subject with lung cancer that has not metastasized or that corresponds to the median value of the c-MAF gene expression levels measured in a tumor tissue collection in biopsy samples from subjects with lung cancer which have not metastasized.

Said reference sample is typically obtained by combining equal amounts of samples from a subject population. Generally, the typical reference samples will be obtained from subjects who are clinically well documented and in whom the absence of metastasis is well characterized. In such samples, the normal concentrations (reference concentration) of the biomarker (c-MAF gene) can be determined, for example by providing the mean concentration over the reference population. Various considerations are taken into account when determining the reference concentration of the marker. Among such considerations are the age, weight, sex, general physical condition of the patient and the like. For example, equal amounts of a group of at least 2, at least 10, at least 100 to preferably more than 1000 subjects, preferably classified according to the foregoing considerations, for example according to various age categories, are taken as the reference group. The sample collection from which the reference level is derived will preferably be formed by subjects suffering from the same type of cancer as the patient object of the study (e.g., lung cancer). Similarly, the reference value within a cohort of patients can be established using a receiving operating curve (ROC) and measuring the area under the curve for all sensitivity and specificity pairs to determine which pair provides the best values and to which reference value corresponds.

Once this median or reference value has been established, the level of this marker expressed in tumor tissues from patients with this median value can be compared and thus be assigned to the “increased” expression level. Due to the variability among subjects (for example, aspects referring to age, race, etc.) it is very difficult (if not virtually impossible) to established absolute reference values of c-MAF expression. Thus, in particular embodiments the reference values for “increased” or “reduced” expression of the c-MAF expression are determined by calculating the percentiles by conventional means which involves performing assays in one or several samples isolated from subjects whose disease is well documented by any of the methods mentioned above the c-MAF expression levels. The “reduced” levels of c-MAF can then preferably be assigned to samples wherein the c-MAF expression levels are equal to or lower than 50th percentile in the normal population including, for example, expression levels equal to or lower than the 60th percentile in the normal population, equal to or lower than the 70th percentile in the normal population, equal to or lower than the 80th percentile in the normal population, equal to or lower than the 90th percentile in the normal population, and equal to or lower than the 95th percentile in the normal population. The “increased” c-MAF gene expression levels can then preferably be assigned to samples wherein the c-MAF gene expression levels are equal to or greater than the 50th percentile in the normal population including, for example, expression levels equal to or greater than the 60th percentile in the normal population, equal to or greater than the 70th percentile in the normal population, equal to or greater than the 80th percentile in the normal population, equal to or greater than the 90th percentile in the normal population, and equal to or greater than the 95th percentile in the normal population.

In the present invention “increased expression levels” is understood as the expression level when it refers to the levels of the c-MAF gene greater than those in a reference sample or control sample. Particularly, a sample can be considered to have high c-MAF expression levels when the expression levels in the reference sample are at least 1.1 times, 1.5 times, 5 times, 10 times, 20 times, 30 times, 40 times, 50 times, 60 times, 70 times, 80 times, 90 times, 100 times or even more with respect to the sample isolated from the patient.

In the context of the present invention, it is understood that “a subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis” when the lung cancer suffered by said subject has metastasized to other organs of the body, in a particular embodiment, to the bone.

In a yet more preferred embodiment, the metastasis to bone is an osteolytic bone metastasis. As used herein, the expression “osteolytic bone metastasis” refers to a type of metastasis in which bone resorption (progressive loss of the bone density) is produced in the proximity of the metastasis resulting from the stimulation of the osteoclast activity by the tumor cells and is characterized by severe pain, pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia, spinal cord compression and other syndromes resulting from nerve compression.

On the other hand, it is understood in the present invention that “a subject has a greater tendency to develop metastasis” when the probabilities that the lung cancer suffered by the subject will metastasize in the future are high.

The person skilled in the art will understand that the prediction of the tendency for a primary lung tumor to metastasize is not intended to be correct for all the subjects to be identified (i.e., for 100% of the subjects). Nevertheless, the term requires enabling the identification of a statistically significant part of the subjects (for example, a cohort in a cohort study). Whether a part is statistically significant can be determined in a simple manner by the person skilled in the art using various well known statistical evaluation tools, for example, the determination of confidence intervals, determination of p values, Student's T test, Mann-Whitney test, etc. Details are provided in Dowdy and Wearden, Statistics for Research, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1983. The preferred confidence intervals are at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99%. The p values are preferably 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 or 0.0001. More preferably, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or at least 90% of the subjects of a population can be suitably identified by the method of the present invention.

As used herein, “agent for avoiding or preventing bone degradation” refers to any molecule capable of preventing, inhibiting, treating, reducing, or stopping bone degradation either by stimulating the osteoblast proliferation or inhibiting the osteoclast proliferation or fixing the bone structure.

As used herein, a “c-MAF inhibitory agent” refers to any molecule capable of completely or partially inhibiting the c-MAF gene expression, both by preventing the expression product of said gene from being produced (interrupting the c-MAF gene transcription and/or blocking the translation of the mRNA coming from the c-MAF gene expression) and by directly inhibiting the c-MAF protein activity. c-MAF gene expression inhibitors can be identified using methods based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the capacity of c-MAF to promote the in vitro cell proliferation, such as shown in the international patent application WO2005/046731 (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference), based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the transcription capacity of a reporter gene under the control of the cyclin D2 promoter or of a promoter containing the c-MAF response region (MARE or c-MAF responsive element) in cells which express c-MAF such as described in WO2008098351 (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference) or based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the IL-4 promoter in response to the stimulation with PMA/ionomycin in cells which express NFATc2 and c-MAF such as described in US2009048117A (the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference).

As used herein, “Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2”, “cyclooxygenase-2” or “COX-2” refers to those proteins that correspond to EC 1.14.99.1. COX-2 is responsible for converting arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxide H2.

As used herein, a “COX-2 inhibitor” refers to any molecule capable of completely or partially inhibiting the COX-2 gene expression, both by preventing the expression product of said gene from being produced (interrupting the COX-2 gene transcription and/or blocking the translation of the mRNA coming from the COX-2 gene expression) and by directly inhibiting the COX-2 protein activity.

As used herein “outcome” or “clinical outcome” refers to the resulting course of disease and/or disease progression and can be characterized for example by recurrence, period of time until recurrence, metastasis, period of time until metastasis, number of metastases, number of sites of metastasis and/or death due to disease. For example a good clinical outcome includes cure, prevention of recurrence, prevention of metastasis and/or survival within a fixed period of time (without recurrence), and a poor clinical outcome includes disease progression, metastasis and/or death within a fixed period of time.

As used herein, “good prognosis” indicates that the subject is expected (e.g. predicted) to survive and/or have no, or is at low risk of having, recurrence or distant metastases within a set time period. The term “low” is a relative term and, in the context of this application, refers to the risk of the “low” expression group with respect to a clinical outcome (recurrence, distant metastases, etc.). A “low” risk can be considered as a risk lower than the average risk for an heterogeneous cancer patient population. In the study of Paik et al. (2004), an overall “low” risk of recurrence was considered to be lower than 15 percent. The risk will also vary in function of the time period. The time period can be, for example, five years, ten years, fifteen years or even twenty years after initial diagnosis of cancer or after the prognosis was made.

As used herein, “poor prognosis” indicates that the subject is expected e.g. predicted to not survive and/or to have, or is at high risk of having, recurrence or distant metastases within a set time period. The term “high” is a relative term and, in the context of this application, refers to the risk of the “high” expression group with respect to a clinical outcome (recurrence, distant metastases, etc.). A “high” risk can be considered as a risk higher than the average risk for a heterogeneous cancer patient population. In the study of Paik et al. (2004), an overall “high” risk of recurrence was considered to be higher than 15 percent. The risk will also vary in function of the time period. The time period can be, for example, five years, ten years, fifteen years or even twenty years of initial diagnosis of cancer or after the prognosis was made.

“Reference value”, as used herein, refers to a laboratory value used as a reference for values/data obtained by laboratory examinations of patients or samples collected from patients. The reference value or reference level can be an absolute value; a relative value; a value that has an upper and/or lower limit; a range of values; an average value; a median value, a mean value, or a value as compared to a particular control or baseline value. A reference value can be based on an individual sample value, such as for example, a value obtained from a sample from the subject being tested, but at an earlier point in time. The reference value can be based on a large number of samples, such as from a population of subjects of the chronological age matched group, or based on a pool of samples including or excluding the sample to be tested.

The term “treatment”, as used herein, refers to any type of therapy, which aims at terminating, preventing, ameliorating or reducing the susceptibility to a clinical condition as described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the term treatment relates to prophylactic treatment (i.e. a therapy to reduce the susceptibility to a clinical condition), of a disorder or a condition as defined herein. Thus, “treatment,” “treating,” and their equivalent terms refer to obtaining a desired pharmacologic or physiologic effect, covering any treatment of a pathological condition or disorder in a mammal, including a human. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disorder or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disorder and/or adverse effect attributable to the disorder. That is, “treatment” includes (1) preventing the disorder from occurring or recurring in a subject, (2) inhibiting the disorder, such as arresting its development, (3) stopping or terminating the disorder or at least symptoms associated therewith, so that the host no longer suffers from the disorder or its symptoms, such as causing regression of the disorder or its symptoms, for example, by restoring or repairing a lost, missing or defective function, or stimulating an inefficient process, or (4) relieving, alleviating, or ameliorating the disorder, or symptoms associated therewith, where ameliorating is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, such as inflammation, pain, or immune deficiency.

As used herein, “sample” or “biological sample” means biological material isolated from a subject. The biological sample may contain any biological material suitable for determining the expression level of the c-MAF gene. The sample can be isolated from any suitable biological tissue or fluid such as, for example, tumor tissue, blood, blood plasma, serum, urine or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).

As used herein, the term “expression level” of a gene as used herein refers to the measurable quantity of gene product produced by the gene in a sample of the subject, wherein the gene product can be a transcriptional product or a translational product. Accordingly, the expression level can pertain to a nucleic acid gene product such as mRNA or cDNA or a polypeptide gene product. The expression level is derived from a subject's sample and/or a reference sample or samples, and can for example be detected de novo or correspond to a previous determination. The expression level can be determined or measured, for example, using microarray methods, PCR methods (such as qPCR), and/or antibody based methods, as is known to a person of skill in the art.

As used herein, the term “gene copy number” refers to the copy number of a nucleic acid molecule in a cell. The gene copy number includes the gene copy number in the genomic (chromosomal) DNA of a cell. In a normal cell (non-tumoral cell), the gene copy number is normally two copies (one copy in each member of the chromosome pair). The gene copy number sometimes includes half of the gene copy number taken from samples of a cell population.

“Increased expression level” is understood as the expression level when it refers to the levels of the c-MAF gene greater than those in a reference sample or control sample. This increased levels can be caused without excluding other mechanisms by a gene or 16q23 or 16q22-24 chromosomal locus amplification or translocation. Particularly, a sample can be considered to have high c-MAF expression level when the expression level in the sample isolated from the patient is at least about 1.1 times, 1.2 times, 1.3 times, 1.4 times, 1.5 times, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, 5 times, 10 times, 20 times, 30 times, 40 times, 50 times, 60 times, 70 times, 80 times, 90 times, 100 times or even more with respect to the reference or control.

“Probe”, as used herein, refers to an oligonucleotide sequence that is complementary to a specific nucleic acid sequence of interest. In some embodiments, the probes may be specific to regions of chromosomes which are known to undergo translocations. In some embodiments, the probes have a specific label or tag. In some embodiments, the tag is a fluorophore. In some embodiments, the probe is a DNA in situ hybridization probe whose labeling is based on the stable coordinative binding of platinum to nucleic acids and proteins. In some embodiments, the probe is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/067,532 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/181,399, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, or as described in Swennenhuis et al. “Construction of repeat-free fluorescence in situ hybridization probes” Nucleic Acids Research 40(3):e20 (2012).

“Tag” or “label”, as used herein, refers to any physical molecule which is directly or indirectly associated with a probe, allowing the probe or the location of the probed to be visualized, marked, or otherwise captured.

“Translocation”, as used herein, refers to the exchange of chromosomal material in unequal or equal amounts between chromosomes. In some cases, the translocation is on the same chromosome. In some cases, the translocation is between different chromosomes. Translocations occur at a high frequency in many types of cancer, including breast cancer and leukemia. Translocations can be either primary reciprocal translocations or the more complex secondary translocations. There are several primary translocations that involve the immunoglobin heavy chain (IgH) locus that are believed to constitute the initiating event in many cancers. (Eychène, A., Rocques, N., and Puoponnot, C., A new MAFia in cancer. 2008. Nature Reviews: Cancer. 8: 683-693.)

“Polyploid” or “polyploidy”, as used herein, indicates that the cell contains more than two copies of a gene of interest. In some instances, the gene of interest is MAF. In some embodiments, polyploidy is associated with an accumulation of expression of the gene of interest. In some embodiments, polyploidy is associated with genomic instability. In some embodiments, the genomic instability may lead to chromosome translocations.

“Whole genome sequencing”, as used herein, is a process by which the entire genome of an organism is sequenced at a single time. See, e.g., Ng., P. C. amd Kirkness, E. F., Whole Genome Sequencing. 2010. Methods in Molecular Biology. 628: 215-226.

“Exome sequencing”, as used herein, is a process by which the entire coding region of the DNA of an organism is sequenced. In exome sequencing, the mRNA is sequenced. The untranslated regions of the genome are not included in exome sequencing. See, e.g., Choi, M. et al., Genetic diagnosis by whole exome capture and massively parallel DNA sequencing. 2009. PNAS. 106(45): 19096-19101.

“Tumor tissue sample” is understood as the tissue sample originating from the lung cancer tumor, including but not limited to circulating tumor cells and circulating tumor DNA. Said sample can be obtained by conventional methods, for example biopsy, using methods well known by the persons skilled in related medical techniques.

“Osteolytic bone metastasis” refers to a type of metastasis in which bone resorption (progressive loss of the bone density) is produced in the proximity of the metastasis resulting from the stimulation of the osteoclast activity by the tumor cells and is characterized by severe pain, pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia, spinal cord compression and other syndromes resulting from nerve compression.

Method for Designing Customized Therapy of the Invention in Patients with Lung Tumors

As is known in the state of the art, the treatment to be administered to a subject suffering from cancer depends on whether the latter is a malignant tumor, i.e., whether it has high probabilities of undergoing metastasis, or whether the latter is a benign tumor. In the first assumption, the treatment of choice is a systemic treatment such as chemotherapy and in the second assumption, the treatment of choice is a localized treatment such as radiotherapy.

Therefore, as described in the present invention, given that the c-MAF gene overexpression in lung cancer cells is related to the presence of metastasis, the c-MAF gene expression levels allow making decisions in terms of the most suitable therapy for the subject suffering said cancer.

Thus, in another aspect the invention relates to an in vitro method for designing a customized therapy for a subject with lung cancer, which comprises


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor sample of
  said subject and
- (ii) comparing the expression level previously obtained with the
  expression level of said gene in a control sample,  
  wherein if the expression levels are increased with respect to the
  expression levels of said gene in the control sample, then said
  subject is susceptible to receive a therapy aiming to prevent and/or
  treat the metastasis. In a particular aspect of the invention, the
  subject is then administered at least one therapy that prevents,
  inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis.  
  wherein if the c-MAF gene expression level is not increased with
  respect to said reference value, then said subject is not susceptible
  to receive a therapy for preventing the bone degradation. In a
  particular aspect of this method, the subject is then not administered
  at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone
  metastasis.

In a particular embodiment, the metastasis is a bone metastasis. In a more preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is osteolytic metastasis.

The terms and expressions “subject”, “lung cancer”, “tumor sample”, “metastasis”, “determination of expression levels”, “c-MAF gene”, “increased expression levels” and “control sample” have been described in detail in relation to the first method of the invention and are equally applicable to the second and third method of the invention.

The second method of the invention comprises in a first step quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor sample in a subject suffering from lung cancer.

In a preferred embodiment, the second method of the invention comprises quantifying only the c-MAF gene expression level as a single marker, i.e., the method does not involve determining the expression level of any additional marker.

In the case of the second method of the invention the sample is a primary tumor tissue sample of the subject. In a second step, the c-MAF gene expression level obtained in the tumor sample of the subject is compared with the expression level of said gene in a control sample. The determination of the c-MAF gene expression levels must be related to values of a control sample or reference sample. Depending on the type of tumor to be analyzed, the exact nature of the control sample may vary. Thus preferably the reference sample is a tumor tissue sample of subject with lung cancer that has not metastasized or that correspond to the median value of the c-MAF gene expression levels measured in a tumor tissue collection in biopsy samples of subjects with lung cancer which has not metastasized.

In yet another embodiment, an expression level of c-MAF which is above the average indicates increased risk of bone metastasis, the risk being proportional to the levels of c-MAF expression, Thus, the risk of bone metastasis in a subject suffering lung cancer is dose-dependent.

Once the c-MAF gene expression levels in the sample have been measured and compared with the control sample, if the expression levels of said gene are increased with respect to their expression levels in the control sample, then it can be concluded that said subject is susceptible to receiving therapy aiming to prevent (if the subject has yet to undergo metastasis) and/or treat metastasis (if the subject has already experienced metastasis). If such increased expression is not observed then the subject is not administered at least one therapy that prevents, inhibits and/or treats the bone metastasis.

When the cancer has metastasized, systemic treatments including but not limited to chemotherapy, hormone treatment, immunotherapy, or a combination thereof are used. Additionally, radiotherapy and/or surgery can be used. The choice of treatment generally depends on the type of primary cancer, the size, the location of the metastasis, the age, the general health of the patient and the types of treatments used previously.

The systemic treatments are those that reach the entire body:


- - Chemotherapy is the use of medicaments to destroy cancer cells. The
    medicaments are generally administered through oral or intravenous
    route. Sometimes, chemotherapy is used together with radiation
    treatment. Suitable chemotherapeutic treatments for lung cancer
    include, without limitation, anthracyclines (doxorubicin,
    epirubicin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), Taxanes (paclitaxel,
    docetaxel, albumin nano-particle bound paclitaxel), 5-fluorouracil
    (continuous infusion 5-FU, capecitabine), Vinca alkaloids
    (vinorelbine, vinblastine), Gemcitabine, Platinum salts (cisplatin,
    carboplatin), cyclophosphamide, Etoposide and combinations of one or
    more of the above such as
    Cyclophosphamide/anthracycline+/−5-fluorouracil regimens (such as
    doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, (EC)
    cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/5-fluorouracil (CEF),
    cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/5-fluorouracil (CAF),
    5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC)),
    cyclophosphamide/metothrexate/5-fluorouracil (CMF),
    anthracyclines/taxanes (such as doxorubicin/paclitaxel or
    doxorubicin/docetaxel), Docetaxel/capecitabine,
    Gemcitabine/paclitaxel, Taxane/platinum regimens (such as
    paclitaxel/carboplatin or docetaxel/carboplatin).
  - Hormone therapy is based on the fact that some hormones promote
    cancer growth. For example, estrogen in women produced by the
    ovaries sometimes promotes the breast cancer growth. There are
    several ways for stopping the production of these hormones. A way is
    to remove the organs producing them: the ovaries in the case of
    women, the testicles in the case of the men. More frequently,
    medicaments to prevent these organs from producing the hormones or
    to prevent the hormones from acting on the cancer cells can be used.
  - Immunotherapy is a treatment that aids the immune system itself of
    the patient to combat cancer. There are several types of
    immunotherapy which are used to treat metastasis patients. These
    include but are not limited to cytokines, monoclonal antibodies and
    antitumor vaccines.

In another aspect, the treatment is Alpharadin (radium-223 dichloride). Alpharadin uses alpha radiation from radium-223 decay to kill cancer cells. Radium-223 naturally self-targets to bone metastases by virtue of its properties as a calcium-mimic. Alpha radiation has a very short range of 2-10 cells (when compared to current radiation therapy which is based on beta or gamma radiation), and therefore causes less damage to surrounding healthy tissues (particularly bone marrow). With similar properties to calcium, radium-223 is drawn to places where calcium is used to build bone in the body, including the site of faster, abnormal bone growth—such as that seen in the skeletal metastases of men with advanced, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Radium-223, after injection, is carried in the bloodstream to sites of abnormal bone growth. The place where a cancer starts in the body is known as the primary tumor. Some of these cells may break away and be carried in the bloodstream to another part of the body. The cancer cells may then settle in that part of the body and form a new tumor. If this happens it is called a secondary cancer or a metastasis. Most patients with late stage prostate cancer suffer the maximum burden of disease in their bones. The aim with radium-223 is to selectively target this secondary cancer. Any radium-223 not taken-up in the bones is quickly routed to the gut and excreted.

In another aspect, COX-2 inhibitors can be identified through methods known in the art (See, e.g., Dannhardt, G. and Kiefer, W. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors—current status and future prospects. 2001. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 36: 109-126, which is herein incorporated by reference). In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used to treat or prevent or inhibit metastasis in a patient with advanced lung cancer. In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used in combination with a second treatment. In some aspects, the second treatment is any treatment described herein. In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used in combination with a second treatment selected from the group consisting of: Denosumab, Zometa (http://www.us.zometa.com/index.jsp?usertrack.filter_applied=true&NovaId=293537693 4467633633; last accessed Dec. 2, 2012), Carbozantinib or Cabozantinib, Antibody or peptide blocking PTHLH (parathyroid hormone like hormone) or PTHrP (parathyroid hormone related protein).

In another aspect, the treatment agents used for avoiding and/or preventing bone degradation include, but are not limited to:


- - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and Parathyroid like hormone (PTHLH)
    inhibitors (including blocking antibodies) or recombinant forms
    thereof (teriparatide corresponding to the amino acids 7-34 of PTH).
    This hormone acts by stimulating the osteoclasts and increasing
    their activity.
  - Strontium ranelate: is an alternative oral treatment, and forms part
    of the group of drugs called “dual action bone agents” (DABAs)
    because they stimulate the osteoblast proliferation and inhibit the
    osteoclast proliferation.
  - “Estrogen receptor modulators” (SERM) refers to compounds which
    interfere or inhibit the binding of estrogens to the receptor,
    regardless of the mechanism. Examples of estrogen receptor
    modulators include, among others, estrogens progestagen, estradiol,
    droloxifene, raloxifene, lasofoxifene, TSE-424, tamoxifen,
    idoxifene, L Y353381, LY117081, toremifene, fluvestrant,
    4-\[7-(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxopropoxy-4-methyl-2-\[4-\[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy\]phenyl\]-2H-1-benzopyran-3-yl\]-phenyl-2,2-dimethylpropanoate
    4,4′dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazone and SH646.
  - Calcitonin: directly inhibits the osteoclast activity through the
    calcitonin receptor. The calcitonin receptors have been identified
    on the surface of the osteoclasts.
  - Bisphosphonates: are a group of medicinal products used for the
    prevention and the treatment of diseases with bone resorption and
    reabsorption such as osteoporosis and cancer with bone metastasis,
    the latter being with or without hypercalcaemia, associated to
    breast cancer and prostate cancer. Examples of bisphosphonates which
    can be used in the therapy designed by means of the fifth method of
    the invention include, although not limited to, nitrogenous
    bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, neridronate, olpadronate,
    alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, incadronate, zoledronate or
    zoledronic acid, etc.) and non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates (such as
    etidronate, clodronate, tiludronate, etc.).
  - “Cathepsin K inhibitors” refers to compounds which interfere in the
    cathepsin K cysteine protease activity. Non-limiting examples of
    cathepsin K inhibitors include 4-amino-pyrimidine-2-carbonitrile
    derivatives (described in the International patent application WO
    03/020278 under the name of Novartis Pharma GMBH),
    pyrrolo-pyrimidines described in the publication WO 03/020721
    (Novartis Pharma GMBH) and the publication WO 04/000843 (ASTRAZENECA
    AB) as well as the inhibitors described in the publications PCT WO
    00/55126 of Axys Pharmaceuticals, WO 01/49288 of Merck Frosst Canada
    & Co. and Axys Pharmaceuticals.
  - “DKK-1 (Dickkopf-1) inhibitor” as used herein refers to any compound
    which is capable of reducing DKK-1 activity. DKK-1 is a soluble Wnt
    pathway antagonist expressed predominantly in adult bone and
    upregulated in myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions. Agents
    targeting DKK-1 may play a role in preventing osteolytic bone
    disease in multiple myeloma patients. BHQ880 from Novartis is a
    first-in-class, fully human, anti-DKK-1 neutralizing antibody.
    Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that BHQ880 promotes bone
    formation and thereby inhibits tumor-induced osteolytic disease
    (Ettenberg S. et al., American Association for Cancer Research
    Annual Meeting. Apr. 12-16, 2008; San Diego, Calif. Abstract).
  - “Dual MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor” as used herein refers to any
    compound which is a potent dual inhibitor of the MET and VEGF
    pathways designed to block MET driven tumor escape. MET is expressed
    not only in tumor cells and endothelial cells, but also in
    osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone-removing
    cells). HGF binds to MET on all of these cell types, giving the MET
    pathway an important role in multiple autocrine and paracrine loops.
    Activation of MET in tumor cells appears to be important in the
    establishment of metastatic bone lesions. At the same time,
    activation of the MET pathway in osteoblasts and osteoclasts may
    lead to pathological features of bone metastases, including abnormal
    bone growth (ie, blastic lesions) or destruction (ie, lytic lesion.
    Thus, targeting the MET pathway may be a viable strategy in
    preventing the establishment and progression of metastatic bone
    lesions. Cabozantinib (Exelixis, Inc), formerly known as XL184 (CAS
    849217-68-1), is a potent dual inhibitor of the MET and VEGF
    pathways designed to block MET driven tumor escape. In multiple
    preclinical studies cabozantinib has been shown to kill tumor cells,
    reduce metastases, and inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of new
    blood vessels necessary to support tumor growth). Another suitable
    dual inhibitors are E7050
    (N-\[2-Fluoro-4-({2-\[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl\]carbonylaminopyridin-4-yl}oxy)phenyl\]-N-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide
    (2R,3R)-tartrate) (CAS 928037-13-2) or Foretinib (also known as
    GSK1363089, XL880, CAS 849217-64-7).
  - “RANKL inhibitors” as used herein refer to any compound which is
    capable of reducing the RANK activity. RANKL is found on the surface
    of the osteoblast membrane of the stroma and T-lymphocyte cells, and
    these T-lymphocyte cells are the only ones which have demonstrated
    the capacity for secreting it. Its main function is the activation
    of the osteoclasts, cells involved in the bone resorption. The RANKL
    inhibitors can act by blocking the binding of RANKL to its receptor
    (RANK), blocking the RANK-mediated signaling or reducing the
    expression of RANKL by blocking the transcription or the translation
    of RANKL. RANKL antagonists or inhibitors suitable for use in the
    present invention include, without limitation:
    - a suitable RANK protein which is capable of binding RANKL and
      which comprises the entire or a fragment of the extracellular
      domain of a RANK protein. The soluble RANK may comprise the signal
      peptide and the extracellular domain of the murine or human RANK
      polypeptides, or alternatively, the mature form of the protein
      with the signal peptide removed can be used.
    - Osteoprotegerin or a variant thereof with RANKL-binding capacity.
    - RANKL-specific antisense molecules
    - Ribozymes capable of processing the transcribed products of RANKL
    - Specific anti-RANKL antibodies. “Anti-RANKL antibody or antibody
      directed against RANKL” is understood herein as all that antibody
      which is capable of binding specifically to the ligand of the
      activating receptor for the nuclear factor κB (RANKL) inhibiting
      one or more RANKL functions. The antibodies can be prepared using
      any of the methods which are known by the person skilled in the
      art. Thus, the polyclonal antibodies are prepared by means of
      immunizing an animal with the protein to be inhibited. The
      monoclonal antibodies are prepared using the method described by
      Kohler, Milstein et al. (Nature, 1975, 256: 495). Antibodies
      suitable in the context of the present invention include intact
      antibodies which comprise a variable antigen binding region and a
      constant region, fragments “Fab”, “F(ab′)2” and “Fab”, Fv, scFv,
      diabodies and bispecific antibodies.
    - Specific anti-RANKL nanobodies. Nanobodies are antibody-derived
      therapeutic proteins that contain the unique structural and
      functional properties of naturally-occurring heavy-chain
      antibodies. The Nanobody technology was originally developed
      following the discovery that camelidae (camels and llamas) possess
      fully functional antibodies that lack light chains. The general
      structure of nanobodies is
      - FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4
    - wherein FR1 to FR4 are the framework regions 1 to 4 CDR1 to CDR3
      are the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3. These
      heavy-chain antibodies contain a single variable domain (VHH) and
      two constant domains (CH2 and CH3). Importantly, the cloned and
      isolated VHH domain is a perfectly stable polypeptide harbouring
      the full antigen-binding capacity of the original heavy-chain
      antibody. These newly discovered VHH domains with their unique
      structural and functional properties form the basis of a new
      generation of therapeutic antibodies which Ablynx has named
      Nanobodies.

In one embodiment, the RANKL inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of a RANKL specific antibody, a RANKL specific nanobody and osteoprotegerin. In a specific embodiment, the anti-RANKL antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In a yet more specific embodiment, the anti-RANKL antibody is Denosumab (Pageau, Steven C. (2009). mAbs 1 (3): 210-215, CAS number 615258-40-7) (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody which binds to RANKL and prevents its activation (it does not bind to the RANK receptor). Various aspects of Denosumab are covered by U.S. Pat.

Method for Designing Customized Therapy of the Invention in Lung Cancer Patients with Bone Metastasis

Patients suffering lung cancer which has already metastasized to the bone and in which there are elevated c-MAF levels may particularly benefit from therapies aimed at preventing the bone degradation caused by the increased osteoclastic activity.

Thus, in another aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for designing a customized therapy for a subject with lung cancer with bone metastasis (hereinafter third method of the invention) which comprises


- (i) quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a metastatic tumor
  sample from bone of said subject, and
- (ii) comparing the expression level previously obtained with the
  expression level of said gene in a control sample,  
  wherein if the expression levels are increased with respect to the
  expression levels of said gene in the control sample, then said
  subject is susceptible to receive a therapy aiming to prevent the bone
  degradation.  
  wherein if the expression level is not increased with respect to said
  reference value, then said subject is not susceptible to receive a
  therapy aiming to prevent and/or treat the bone metastasis.

The terms and expressions “subject”, “lung cancer”, “tumor sample”, “metastasis”, “determination of expression levels”, “c-MAF gene”, “increased expression levels” and “control sample” have been described in detail in relation to the first method of the invention and are equally applicable to the second and third method of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is osteolytic metastasis.

The third method of the invention comprises in a first step, quantifying the c-MAF gene expression level in a tumor sample in a subject suffering lung cancer. In the case of the third method of the invention, the sample is a tissue sample from bone metastasis.

In a preferred embodiment, the third method of the invention comprises quantifying only the c-MAF gene expression level as a single marker, i.e., the method does not involve determining the expression level of any additional marker.

In a second step the c-MAF gene expression level obtained in the tumor sample of the subject is compared with the expression level of said gene in a control sample. The determination of the c-MAF gene expression levels must be correlated to values of a control sample or reference sample. Depending on the type of tumor to be analyzed, the exact nature of the control sample may vary. Thus, in the case involving the third method of the invention, then the reference sample is a tumor tissue sample of subject with lung cancer who has not suffered metastasis or that correspond to the median value of the c-MAF gene expression levels measured in a tumor tissue collection in biopsy samples of subjects with lung cancer who has not suffered metastasis.

Once the c-MAF gene expression level in the sample is measured and compared with the control sample, if the expression level of said gene are increased with respect to its expression levels in the control sample, then it can be concluded that said subject is susceptible to receive a therapy aiming to avoid or prevent bone degradation.

As used herein, an “agent for avoiding or preventing bone degradation” refers to any molecule capable of treating or stopping bone degradation either by stimulating the osteoblast proliferation or inhibiting the osteoclast proliferation.

Illustrative examples of agents used for avoiding and/or preventing bone degradation and/or bone metastasis include, although not limited to:


- - Parathyroid hormone (PTH) or recombinant forms thereof (teriparatide
    corresponding to the amino acids 1-34 of PTH). This hormone acts by
    stimulating the osteoblasts and increasing their activity.
  - Strontium ranelate: is an alternative oral treatment, and forms part
    of the group of drugs called “dual action bone agents” (DABAs)
    because they stimulate the osteoblast proliferation and inhibit the
    osteoclast proliferation.
  - “Estrogen receptor modulators” (SERM) refers to compounds which
    interfere or inhibit the binding of estrogens to the receptor,
    regardless of the mechanism. Examples of estrogen receptor
    modulators include, among others, estrogens progestagen, estradiol,
    droloxifene, raloxifene, lasofoxifene, TSE-424, tamoxifen,
    idoxifene, L Y353381, LY117081, toremifene, fluvestrant,
    4-\[7-(2,2-dimethyl-1-oxopropoxy-4-methyl-2-\[4-\[2-(1-piperidinyl)ethoxy\]phenyl\]-2H-1-benzopyran-3-yl\]-phenyl-2,2-dimethylpropanoate
    4,4′dihydroxybenzophenone-2,4-dinitrophenyl-hydrazone and SH646.
  - Calcitonin: directly inhibits the osteoclast activity through the
    calcitonin receptor. The calcitonin receptors have been identified
    on the surface of the osteoclasts.
  - Bisphosphonates: are a group of medicinal products used for the
    prevention and the treatment of diseases with bone resorption and
    reabsorption such as osteoporosis and cancer with bone metastasis,
    the latter being with or without hypercalcaemia, associated to
    breast cancer and prostate cancer. Examples of bisphosphonates which
    cane be used in the therapy designed by means of the third method of
    the invention include, although not limited to, nitrogenous
    bisphosphonates (such as pamidronate, neridronate, olpadronate,
    alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, incadronate, zoledronate or
    zoledronic acid, etc.) and non-nitrogenous bisphosphonates (such as
    etidronate, clodronate, tiludronate, etc.).
  - “Cathepsin K inhibitors” refers to compounds which interfere in the
    cathepsin K cysteine protease activity. Non-limiting examples of
    cathepsin K inhibitors include 4-amino-pyrimidine-2-carbonitrile
    derivatives (described in the International patent application WO
    03/020278 under the name of Novartis Pharma GMBH),
    pyrrolo-pyrimidines described in the publication WO 03/020721
    (Novartis Pharma GMBH) and the publication WO 04/000843 (ASTRAZENECA
    AB) as well as the inhibitors described in the publications PCT WO
    00/55126 of Axys Pharmaceuticals, WO 01/49288 of Merck Frosst Canada
    & Co. and Axys Pharmaceuticals.
  - “DKK-1 (Dickkopf-1) inhibitor” as used herein refers to any compound
    which is capable of reducing DKK-1 activity. DKK-1 is a soluble Wnt
    pathway antagonist expressed predominantly in adult bone and
    upregulated in myeloma patients with osteolytic lesions. Agents
    targeting DKK-1 may play a role in preventing osteolytic bone
    disease in multiple myeloma patients. BHQ880 from Novartis is a
    first-in-class, fully human, anti-DKK-1 neutralizing antibody.
    Preclinical studies support the hypothesis that BHQ880 promotes bone
    formation and thereby inhibits tumor-induced osteolytic disease
    (Ettenberg S. et al., American Association for Cancer Research
    Annual Meeting. Apr. 12-16, 2008; San Diego, Calif. Abstract).
  - “Dual MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor” as used herein refers to any
    compound which is a potent dual inhibitor of the MET and VEGF
    pathways designed to block MET driven tumor escape. MET is expressed
    not only in tumor cells and endothelial cells, but also in
    osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone-removing
    cells). HGF binds to MET on all of these cell types, giving the MET
    pathway an important role in multiple autocrine and paracrine loops.
    Activation of MET in tumor cells appears to be important in the
    establishment of metastatic bone lesions. At the same time,
    activation of the MET pathway in osteoblasts and osteoclasts may
    lead to pathological features of bone metastases, including abnormal
    bone growth (ie, blastic lesions) or destruction (ie, lytic lesion.
    Thus, targeting the MET pathway may be a viable strategy in
    preventing the establishment and progression of metastatic bone
    lesions. Cabozantinib (Exelixis, Inc), formerly known as XL184 (CAS
    849217-68-1), is a potent dual inhibitor of the MET and VEGF
    pathways designed to block MET driven tumor escape. In multiple
    preclinical studies cabozantinib has been shown to kill tumor cells,
    reduce metastases, and inhibit angiogenesis (the formation of new
    blood vessels necessary to support tumor growth). Another suitable
    dual inhibitors are E7050
    (N-\[2-Fluoro-4-({2-\[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl\]carbonylaminopyridin-4-yl}oxy)phenyl\]-N′-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide(2R,3R)-tartrate)
    (CAS 928037-13-2) or Foretinib (also known as GSK1363089, XL880, CAS
    849217-64-7).
  - “RANKL inhibitors” as used herein refers to any compound which is
    capable of reducing the RANK activity. RANKL is found on the surface
    of the osteoblast membrane of the stroma and T-lymphocyte cells, and
    these T-lymphocyte cells are the only ones which have demonstrated
    the capacity for secreting it. Its main function is the activation
    of the osteoclasts, cells involved in the bone resorption. The RANKL
    inhibitors can act by blocking the binding of RANKL to its receptor
    (RANK), blocking the RANK-mediated signaling or reducing the
    expression of RANKL by blocking the transcription or the translation
    of RANKL. RANKL antagonists or inhibitors suitable for use in the
    present invention include, without limitation:
    - a suitable RANK protein which is capable of binding RANKL and
      which comprises the entire or a fragment of the extracellular
      domain of a RANK protein. The soluble RANK may comprise the signal
      peptide and the extracellular domain of the murine or human RANK
      polypeptides, or alternatively, the mature form of the protein
      with the signal peptide removed can be used.
    - Osteoprotegerin or a variant thereof with RANKL-binding capacity.
    - RANKL-specific antisense molecules
    - Ribozymes capable of processing the transcribed products of RANKL
    - Specific anti-RANKL antibodies. “Anti-RANKL antibody or antibody
      directed against RANKL” is understood herein as all that antibody
      which is capable of binding specifically to the ligand of the
      activating receptor for the nuclear factor κB (RANKL) inhibiting
      one or more RANKL functions. The antibodies can be prepared using
      any of the methods which are known by the person skilled in the
      art. Thus, the polyclonal antibodies are prepared by means of
      immunizing an animal with the protein to be inhibited. The
      monoclonal antibodies are prepared using the method described by
      Kohler, Milstein et al. (Nature, 1975, 256: 495). Antibodies
      suitable in the context of the present invention include intact
      antibodies which comprises a variable antigen binding region and a
      constant region, fragments “Fab”, “F(ab′)2” and “Fab′”, Fv, scFv,
      diabodies and bispecific antibodies.
    - Specific anti-RANKL nanobodies. Nanobodies are antibody-derived
      therapeutic proteins that contain the unique structural and
      functional properties of naturally-occurring heavy-chain
      antibodies. The Nanobody technology was originally developed
      following the discovery that camelidae (camels and llamas) possess
      fully functional antibodies that lack light chains. The general
      structure of nanobodies is

FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4 wherein FR1 to FR4 are the framework regions 1 to 4 CDR1 to CDR3 are the complementarity determining regions 1 to 3. These heavy-chain antibodies contain a single variable domain (VHH) and two constant domains (CH2 and CH3). Importantly, the cloned and isolated VHH domain is a perfectly stable polypeptide harbouring the full antigen-binding capacity of the original heavy-chain antibody. These newly discovered VHH domains with their unique structural and functional properties form the basis of a new generation of therapeutic antibodies which Ablynx has named Nanobodies.

In one embodiment, the RANKL inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of a RANKL specific antibody, a RANKL specific nanobody and osteoprotegerin. In a preferred embodiment, the anti-RANKL antibody is a monoclonal antibody. In a yet more preferred embodiment, the anti-RANKL antibody is Denosumab (Pageau, Steven C. (2009). mAbs 1 (3): 210-215, CAS number 615258-40-7).

Eur. J. Med. Chem. 36: 109-126, which is herein incorporated by reference). In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used to treat or prevent or inhibit metastasis in a patient with advanced lung cancer. In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used in combination with a second treatment. In some aspects, the second treatment is any treatment described herein. In some aspects, the COX-2 inhibitor is used in combination with a second treatment selected from the group consisting of: Denosumab, Zometa (http://www.us.zometa.com/index.jsp?usertrack.filter_applied=true&NovaId=293537693 4467633633; last accessed Dec. 2, 2012), Carbozantinib or Cabozantinib, Antibody or peptide blocking PTHLH (parathyroid hormone like hormone) or PTHrP (parathyroid hormone related protein).

In a preferred embodiment the Radium 223 therapy is Alpharadin (aka, Xofigo) (radium-223 dichloride). Alpharadin uses alpha radiation from radium-223 decay to kill cancer cells. Radium-223 naturally self-targets to bone metastases by virtue of its properties as a calcium-mimic. Alpha radiation has a very short range of 2-10 cells (when compared to current radiation therapy which is based on beta or gamma radiation), and therefore causes less damage to surrounding healthy tissues (particularly bone marrow). With similar properties to calcium, radium-223 is drawn to places where calcium is used to build bone in the body, including the site of faster, abnormal bone growth—such as that seen in the skeletal metastases of men with advanced, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Radium-223, after injection, is carried in the bloodstream to sites of abnormal bone growth. The place where a cancer starts in the body is known as the primary tumor. Some of these cells may break away and be carried in the bloodstream to another part of the body. The cancer cells may then settle in that part of the body and form a new tumor. If this happens it is called a secondary cancer or a metastasis. Most patients with late stage prostate cancer suffer the maximum burden of disease in their bones. The aim with radium-223 is to selectively target this secondary cancer. Any radium-223 not taken-up in the bones is quickly routed to the gut and excreted. In a preferred embodiment, the agent preventing the bone degradation is a bisphosphonate. In a yet more preferred embodiment, the bisphosphonate is the zoledronic acid.

Alternatively a combined treatment can be carried out in which more than one agent from those mentioned above are combined to treat and/or prevent the metastasis or said agents can be combined with other supplements, such as calcium or vitamin D or with a hormone treatment.

Method of Diagnosis or Prognosis of Metastasis in Lung Cancer Based on Detecting the Amplification of the c-MAF Gene

In one aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for the diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer (hereinafter, fourth diagnosis method of the invention) and/or for the prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified in a tumor tissue sample of said subject; wherein if said gene is amplified with respect to a control sample, then said subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

In a particular embodiment, the lung cancer diagnosed in the fourth method of the invention is NSCLC.

The terms “c-MAF gene”, “metastasis”, “tumor sample”, “lung cancer”, “diagnosis of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer”, “prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer”, “subject”, “patient”, “subject having a positive diagnosis of metastasis”, “subject having a greater tendency to develop metastasis” have been described in detail in the context of the first method of the invention and are equally applicable to the fourth method of the invention.

In a particular embodiment, the degree of amplification of the c-MAF gene can be determined by means of determining the amplification of a chromosome region containing said gene. Preferably, the chromosome region the amplification of which is indicative of the existence of amplification of the c-MAF gene is the locus 16q22-q24 which includes the c-MAF gene. The locus 16q22-q24 is located in chromosome 16, in the long arm of said chromosome and in a range between band 22 and band 24. This region corresponds in the NCBI database with the contigs NT—010498.15 and NT—010542.15. In another preferred embodiment, the degree of amplification of the c-MAF gene can be determined by means of using a probe specific for said gene.

The fourth diagnosis/prognosis method of the invention comprises, in a first step, determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified in a tumor sample of a subject. To that end, the amplification of the c-MAF gene in the tumor sample is compared with respect to a control sample.

The term “amplification of a gene” as understood herein refers to a process through which various copies of a gene or of a gene fragment are formed in an individual cell or a cell line. The copies of the gene are not necessarily located in the same chromosome. The duplicated region is often called an “amplicon”. Normally, the amount of mRNA produced, i.e., the gene expression level also increases in proportion to the copy number of a particular gene.

In a particular embodiment, the fourth method of the invention for the diagnoses of metastasis in a subject with lung cancer and/or for the prognosis of the tendency to develop metastasis in a subject with lung cancer, comprises determining the c-MAF gene copy number in a tumor sample of said subject and comparing said copy number with the copy number of a control or reference sample, wherein if the c-MAF copy number is greater with respect to the c-MAF copy number of a control sample, then the subject has a positive diagnosis of metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

The control sample refers to a tumor sample of a subject with lung cancer who has not suffered metastasis or that correspond to the median value of the c-MAF gene copy number measured in a tumor tissue collection in biopsy samples of subjects with lung cancer who have not suffered metastasis. Said reference sample is typically obtained by combining equal amounts of samples from a subject population. If the c-MAF gene copy number is increased with respect to the copy number of said gene in the control sample, then subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

As used herein, the term “gene copy number” refers to the copy number of a nucleic acid molecule in a cell. The gene copy number includes the gene copy number in the genomic (chromosomal) DNA of a cell. In a normal cell (non-tumoral cell), the gene copy number is normally two copies (one copy in each member of the chromosome pair). The gene copy number sometimes includes half of the gene copy number taken from samples of a cell population.

In the present invention, “increased gene copy number” is understood as when the c-MAF gene copy number is more than the copy number that a reference sample or control sample has. In particular, it can be considered that a sample has an increased c-MAF copy number when the copy number is more than 2 copies, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 copies, and even more than 10 copies of the c-MAF gene.

In some embodiments, the amplification is in region at the 16q23 locus. In some embodiments, the amplification is in any part of the chromosomal region between about Chr. 16-about 79,392,959 bp to about 79,663,806 bp (from centromere to telomere). In some embodiments, the amplification is in the genomic region between about Chr. 16-about 79,392,959 bp to about 79,663,806 bp, but excluding DNA repeating elements. In some embodiments, amplification is measured using a probe specific for that region.

In a particular embodiment, the amplification or the copy number is determined by means of in situ hybridization or PCR.

Methods for determining whether the c-MAF gene or the chromosome region 16q22-q24 is amplified are widely known in the state of the art. Said methods include, without limitation, in situ hybridization (ISH) (such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) or silver in situ hybridization (SISH)), genomic comparative hybridization or polymerase chain reaction (such as real time quantitative PCR). For any ISH method, the amplification or the copy number can be determined by counting the number of fluorescent points, colored points or points with silver in the chromosomes or in the nucleus.

The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique which is used for detecting and locating the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences in chromosomes. FISH uses fluorescence probes which only bind to some parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence similarity. In a typical FISH method, the DNA probe is labeled with a fluorescent molecule or a hapten, typically in the form of fluor-dUTP, digoxigenin-dUTP, biotin-dUTP or hapten-dUTP which is incorporated in the DNA using enzymatic reactions, such as nick translation or PCR. The sample containing the genetic material (the chromosomes) is placed on glass slides and is denatured by a formamide treatment. The labeled probe is then hybridized with the sample containing the genetic material under suitable conditions which will be determined by the person skilled in the art. After the hybridization, the sample is viewed either directly (in the case of a probe labeled with fluorine) or indirectly (using fluorescently labeled antibodies to detect the hapten).

In the case of CISH, the probe is labeled with digoxigenin, biotin or fluorescein and is hybridized with the sample containing the genetic material in suitable conditions.

Any marking or labeling molecule which can bind to a DNA can be used to label the probes used in the fourth method of the invention, thus allowing the detection of nucleic acid molecules. Examples of labels for the labeling include, although not limited to, radioactive isotopes, enzyme substrates, cofactors, ligands, chemiluminescence agents, fluorophores, haptens, enzymes and combinations thereof. Methods for labeling and guideline for selecting suitable labels for different purposes can be found, for example, in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989) and Ausubel et al. (In Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998).

Once the existence of amplification is determined, either by directly determining the amplification of the c-MAF gene or by determining the amplification of the locus 16q22-q24, and after being compared with the amplification of said gene in the control sample, if amplification in the c-MAF gene is detected, it is indicative of the fact that the subject has a positive diagnosis for metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

The determination of the amplification of the c-MAF gene needs to be correlated with values of a control sample or reference sample that correspond to the level of amplification of the c-MAF gene measured in a tumor tissue sample of a subject with lung cancer who has not suffered metastasis or that correspond to the median value of the amplification of the c-MAF gene measured in a tumor tissue collection in biopsy samples of subjects with lung cancer who have not suffered metastasis. Said reference sample is typically obtained by combining equal amounts of samples from a subject population. In general, the typical reference samples will be obtained from subjects who are clinically well documented and in whom the absence of metastasis is well characterized. The sample collection from which the reference level is derived will preferably be made up of subjects suffering the same type of cancer as the patient object of the study (e.g., NSCLC). Once this median value has been established, the level of amplification of c-MAF in tumor tissues of patients can be compared with this median value, and thus, if there is amplification, the subject has a positive diagnosis of metastasis or a greater tendency to develop metastasis.

In a preferred embodiment, the metastasis is bone metastasis. In a yet more preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is osteolytic bone metastasis. As used herein, the expression “osteolytic bone metastasis” refers to a type of metastasis in which bone resorption (progressive loss of bone density) is produced in the proximity of the metastasis resulting from the stimulation of the osteoclast activity by the tumor cells and is characterized by severe pain, pathological fractures, hypercalcaemia, spinal cord compression and other syndromes resulting from nerve compression.

Method of Prognosis of Metastasis in Lung Cancer Based on Detecting the Translocation of the c-MAF Gene

In another aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for predicting the clinical outcome of a patient suffering from lung cancer, which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is translocated in a sample of said subject wherein a translocation of the c-MAF gene is indicative of a poor clinical outcome.

In another aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method for predicting the clinical outcome of a patient suffering lung cancer, which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is translocated in a sample of said subject wherein a translocation of the c-MAF gene is indicative of a poor clinical outcome.

In some embodiments, the translocated gene is from the region at the 16q23 locus. In some embodiments, the translocated gene is from any part of the chromosomal region between about Chr. 16—about 79,392,959 bp to about 79,663,806 bp (from centromere to telomere). In some embodiments, the translocated gene is from the genomic region between about Chr. 16—about 79,392,959 bp to about 79,663,806 bp, but excluding DNA repeating elements. In some embodiments, the translocation is measured using a probe specific for that region.

In a particular embodiment, the translocation of the c-MAF gene can be determined by means of determining the translocation of a chromosome region containing said gene. In one embodiment, the translocation is the t(14,16) translocation. In another embodiment, the chromosome region that is translocated is from locus 16q22-q24. The locus 16q22-q24 is located in chromosome 16, in the long arm of said chromosome and in a range between band 22 and band 24. This region corresponds in the NCBI database with the contigs NT—010498.15 and NT—010542.15. In a preferred embodiment, the c-MAF gene translocates to chromosome 14 at the locus 14q32, resulting in the translocation t(14,16)(q32,q23). This translocation places the MAF gene next to the strong enhancers in the IgH locus, which, in some cases, leads to overexpression of MAF. (Eychène, A., Rocques, N., and Puoponnot, C., A new MAFia in cancer. 2008. Nature Reviews: Cancer. 8: 683-693.)

In a preferred embodiment, the translocation of the c-MAF gene can be determined by means of using a probe specific for said translocation. In some embodiments, the translocation is measured using a dual color probe. In some embodiments, the translocation is measured using a dual fusion probe.

In a particular embodiment, a method of the invention for the prognosis of the tendency to develop bone metastasis in a subject with lung cancer comprises determining the c-MAF gene copy number in a sample of said subject wherein the c-MAF gene is translocated and comparing said copy number with the copy number of a control or reference sample, wherein if the c-MAF copy number is greater with respect to the c-MAF copy number of a control sample, then the subject has a greater tendency to develop bone metastasis. In a preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is very early bone metastasis. In a preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is osteolytic metastasis.

“Average level” as used herein relates to a single value of c-MAF expression level (as a mean, mode, or median) that summarizes or represents the general significance of a set of unequal values. In a preferred embodiment the average level corresponds to the average of expression levels obtained from a representative cohort of lung cancer tumors. The patient cohort is defined by age that is representative of the individual patient that one is attempting to evaluate.

“Standard deviation” as used herein relates to a measure of the dispersion of a collection of numbers. For example, the standard deviation for the average normal level of c-MAF is the dispersion of a collection of the c-MAF levels found in lung tumor samples The more spread apart the data, the higher the deviation. Standard deviation can be obtained by extracting the square root of the mean of squared deviations of observed values from their mean in a frequency distribution.

Once the c-MAF gene expression level in a sample from a subject with lung cancer, has been measured and compared with the average level, if the expression level of said gene is above the average plus one standard deviation with respect to the average level, then it can be concluded that said subject has a greater tendency to develop early bone metastasis.

Methods for determining whether the c-MAF gene or the chromosome region 16q22-q24 is translocated are widely known in the state of the art and include those described previously for the amplification of c-MAF. Said methods include, without limitation, in situ hybridization (ISH) (such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) or silver in situ hybridization (SISH)), genomic comparative hybridization or polymerase chain reaction (such as real time quantitative PCR). For any ISH method, the amplification, the copy number, or the translocation can be determined by counting the number of fluorescent points, colored points or points with silver in the chromosomes or in the nucleus. In other embodiments, the detection of copy number alterations and translocations can be detected through the use of whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing or by the use of any PCR derived technology. For instance, PCR can be performed on samples of genomic DNA to detect translocation. In one embodiment, quantitative PCR is used. In one embodiment, PCR is performed with a primer specific to the c-MAF gene and a primer specific to the IGH promoter region; if a product is produced, translocation has occurred.

In some embodiments, the amplification and copy number of the c-MAF gene are determined after translocation of the c-MAF gene is determined. In some embodiments, the probe is used to determine if the cell is polyploid for the c-MAF gene. In some embodiments, a determination of polyploidy is made by determining if there are more than 2 signals from the gene of interest. In some embodiments, polyploidy is determined by measuring the signal from the probe specific for the gene of interest and comparing it with a centromeric probe or other probe.

Method of Prognosis of Clinical Outcome in Lung Cancer Based on Detecting the Amplification or Translocation of the c-MAF Gene

In another aspect, the invention relates to an in vitro method (hereinafter seventh method of the invention) for predicting the clinical outcome of a patient suffering lung cancer, which comprises determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified or translocated in a sample of said subject relative to a reference gene copy number wherein an amplification of the c-MAF gene with respect to said reference gene copy number is indicative of a poor clinical outcome.

The seventh method of the invention comprises, in a first step, determining if the c-MAF gene is amplified in a sample of a subject. The determination of the amplification of the c-MAF is carried out essentially as described in the fifth method of the invention. In a preferred embodiment the sample is a tumor tissue sample. In a preferred embodiment, the amplification of the c-MAF gene is determined by means of determining the amplification of the locus 16q23 or 16q22-q24. In another preferred embodiment, the amplification of the c-MAF gene is determined by means of using a c-MAF gene-specific probe.

In a second step, the seventh method of the invention comprises comparing said copy number with the copy number of a control or reference sample, wherein if the c-MAF copy number is greater with respect to the c-MAF copy number of a control sample, then this is indicative of a poor clinical outcome.

In a preferred embodiment, the c-MAF gene is amplified with respect to a reference gene copy number when the c-MAF gene copy number is higher than the copy number that a reference sample or control sample has. In one example, the c-MAF gene is said to be “amplified” if the genomic copy number of the c-MAF gene is increased by at least 2—(i.e., 6 copies), 3—(i.e., 8 copies), 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, 30-, 35-, 40-, 45-, or 50-fold in a test sample relative to a control sample. In another example, a c-MAF gene is said to be “amplified” if the genomic copy number of the c-MAF gene per cell is at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and the like.

In another embodiment, the reference gene copy number is the gene copy number in a sample of lung cancer, from a subject who has not suffered bone metastasis.

In another embodiment, the amplification is determined by means of in situ hybridization or PCR.

### Therapeutic Methods of the Invention

Treating Bone Metastasis Using c-MAF Inhibitory Agents

A c-MAF gene expression inhibitory agent or an inhibitory agent of the protein encoded by said gene can be used in the treatment and/or the prevention of lung cancer metastasis.

In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a c-MAF inhibitory agent for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of bone metastasis lung cancer.

In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the treatment or prevention of the bone metastasis from lung cancer, in a subject in need thereof comprising the administration to said subject of a c-MAF inhibitory agent.

In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for preventing or reducing the risk of bone metastasis in a subject suffering from lung cancer, said method comprising administering to said subject an agent that prevents or reduces bone metastasis, wherein said agent is administered in accordance with a treatment regimen determined from quantifying the expression level of c-MAF in said subject.

Therefore, in another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a c-MAF gene expression inhibitory agent or an inhibitory agent of the protein encoded by said gene (hereinafter, inhibitory agent of the invention) in the preparation of a medicinal product for treating and/or preventing lung cancer metastasis. Alternatively, the invention relates to a c-MAF gene expression inhibitory agent or an inhibitory agent of the protein encoded by said gene for use in the treatment and/or the prevention of lung cancer metastasis. Alternatively, the invention relates to a method for treating the lung cancer metastasis in a subject which comprises administering a c-MAF inhibitor to said subject.

As used herein, a “c-MAF inhibitory agent” refers to any molecule capable of completely or partially inhibiting the c-MAF gene expression, both by preventing the expression product of said gene from being produced (interrupting the c-MAF gene transcription and/or blocking the translation of the mRNA coming from the c-MAF gene expression) and by directly inhibiting the c-MAF protein activity. C-MAF gene expression inhibitors can be identified using methods based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the capacity of c-MAF to promote the in vitro cell proliferation, such as shown in the international patent application WO2005/046731 (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the transcription capacity of a reporter gene under the control of the cyclin D2 promoter or of a promoter containing the c-MAF response region (MARE or c-MAF responsive element) in cells which express c-MAF such as described in WO2008098351 (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) or based on the capacity of the so-called inhibitor to block the expression of a reporter gene under the control of the IL-4 promoter in response to the stimulation with PMA/ionomycin in cells which express NFATc2 and c-MAF such as described in US2009048117A (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).

By way of non-limiting illustration, c-MAF inhibitory agents suitable for use in the present invention include antisense oligonucleotides, interference RNAs (siRNAs), catalytic RNAs or specific ribozymes and inhibitory antibodies.

**Antisense Oligonucleotides**

An additional aspect of the invention relates to the use of isolated “antisense” nucleic acids to inhibit expression, for example, for inhibiting transcription and/or translation of a nucleic acid which encodes c-MAF the activity of which is to be inhibited. The antisense nucleic acids can be bound to the target potential of the drug by means of conventional base complementarity or, for example, in the case of biding to Double stranded DNA through specific interaction in the large groove of the double helix. Generally, these methods refer to a range of techniques generally used in the art and they include any method which is based on the specific binding to oligonucleotide sequences.

An antisense construct of the present invention can be administered, for example, as an expression plasmid which, when is transcribed in cell, produces RNA complementary to at least one unique part of the cellular mRNA encoding c-MAF. Alternatively, the antisense construct is a oligonucleotide probe generated ex vivo which, when introduced into the cell, produces inhibition of gene expression hybridizing with the mRNA and/or gene sequences of a target nucleic acid. Such oligonucleotide probes are preferably modified oligonucleotides which are resistant to endogenous nucleases, for example, exonucleases and/or endonucleases and are therefore stable in vivo. Examples of nucleic acids molecules for use thereof as an antisense oligonucleotides are DNA analogs of phosphoramidate, phosphothionate and methylphosphonate (see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,176,996; 5,264,564; and 5,256,775)(hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). Additionally, the general approximations for constructing oligomers useful in the antisense therapy have been reviewed, for example, in Van der Krol et al., BioTechniques 6: 958-976, 1988; and Stein et al., Cancer Res 48: 2659-2668, 1988.

With respect to the antisense oligonucleotide, the oligodeoxyribonucleotide regions derived from the starting site of the translation, for example, between −10 and +10 of the target gene are preferred. The antisense approximations involve the oligonucleotide design (either DNA or RNA) that are complementary to the mRNA encoding the target polypeptide. The antisense oligonucleotide will be bound to the transcribed mRNA and translation will be prevented.

The oligonucleotides which are complementary to the 5′ end of the mRNA, for example the non translated 5′ sequence up to and including the start codon AUG must function in the most efficient manner to inhibit translation. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the sequences complementary to the non translated 3′ sequences of the mRNA are also efficient for inhibiting mRNA translation (Wagner, Nature 372: 333, 1994). Therefore, complementary oligonucleotides could be used at the non translated 5′ or 3′ regions, non coding regions of a gene in an antisense approximation to inhibit the translation of that mRNA. The oligonucleotides complementary to the non translated 5′ region of the mRNA must include the complement of the start codon AUG. The oligonucleotides complementary to the coding region of the mRNA are less efficient translation inhibitors but they could also be used according to the invention. If they are designed to hybridize with the 5′ region, 3′ region or the coding region of the mRNA, the antisense nucleic acids must have at least six nucleotides long and preferably have less than approximately 100 and more preferably less than approximately 50, 25, 17 or 10 nucleotides long.

Preferably, in vitro studies are performed first to quantify the capacity of the antisense oligonucleotides for inhibiting gene expression. Preferably these studies use controls which distinguish between antisense gene inhibition and non specific biological effects of the oligonucleotides. Also preferably these studies compared the levels of target RNA or protein with that of an internal control of RNA or protein. The results obtained using the antisense oligonucleotides can be compared with those obtained using a control oligonucleotide. Preferably the control oligonucleotide is approximately of the same length as the oligonucleotide to be assayed and that the oligonucleotide sequence does not differ from the antisense sequence more than it is deemed necessary to prevent the specific hybridization to the target sequence.

The antisense oligonucleotide can be a single or double stranded DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof. The oligonucleotide can be modified in the base group, the sugar group or the phosphate backbone, for example, to improve the stability of the molecule, its hybridization capacity etc. The oligonucleotide may include other bound groups, such as peptides (for example, for directing them to the receptors of the host cells) or agents for facilitating transport through the cell membrane (see, for example, Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86: 6553-6556, 1989; Lemaitre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 84: 648-652, 1987; PCT Publication No. WO 88/09810) or the blood-brain barrier (see, for example, PCT Publication No. WO 89/10134), intercalating agents (see, for example, Zon, Pharm. Res. 5: 539-549, 1988). For this purpose, the oligonucleotide can be conjugated to another molecule, for example, a peptide, a transporting agent, hybridization triggered cleaving agent, etc.

The antisense oligonucleotides may comprise at least one group of modified base. The antisense oligonucleotide may also comprise at least a modified sugar group selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose. The antisense oligonucleotide may also contain a backbone similar to a neutral peptide. Such molecules are known as peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers and are described, for example, in Perry-O'Keefe et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93: 14670, 1996, and in Eglom et al., Nature 365: 566, 1993.

In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide comprises at least one modified phosphate backbone. In yet another embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotide is an alpha-anomeric oligonucleotide.

While antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the coding region of the target mRNA sequence can be used, those complementary to the transcribed non translated region can also be used.

In some cases, it may be difficult to reach the sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense to suppress the endogenous mRNA translation. Therefore, a preferred approximation uses a recombinant DNA construct in which the antisense oligonucleotide is placed under the control of a strong pol III or pol II promoter.

Alternatively, the target gene expression can be reduced by directing deoxyribonucleotide sequences complementary to the gene regulating region (i.e., the promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helix structures preventing gene transcription in the target cells in the body (see in general, Helene, Anticancer Drug Des. 6(6): 569-84, 1991). In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotides are antisense morpholines.

siRNA

Small interfering RNA or siRNA are agents which are capable of inhibiting the expression of a target gene by means of RNA interference. A siRNA can be chemically synthesized, can be obtained by means of in vitro transcription or can be synthesized in vivo in the target cell. Typically, the siRNA consist of a double stranded RNA between 15 and 40 nucleotide long and may contain a 3′ and/or 5′ protruding region of 1 to 6 nucleotides. The length of the protruding region is independent of the total length of the siRNA molecule. The siRNA act by means of degrading or silencing the target messenger after transcription.

The siRNA of the invention are substantially homologous to the mRNA of the c-MAF encoding gene or to the gene sequence which encodes said protein. “Substantially homologous” is understood as having a sequence which is sufficiently complementary or similar to the target mRNA such that the siRNA is capable of degrading the latter through RNA interference. The siRNA suitable for causing said interference include siRNA formed by RNA, as well as siRNA containing different chemical modifications such as:


- - siRNA in which the bonds between the nucleotides are different than
    those appear in nature, such as phosphorothionate bonds.
  - Conjugates of the RNA strand with a functional reagent, such as a
    fluorophore.
  - Modifications of the ends of the RNA strands, particularly of the 3′
    end by means of the modification with different hydroxyl functional
    groups in 2′ position.
  - Nucleotides with modified sugars such as O-alkylated residues on 2′
    position like 2′-O-methylribose or 2′-O-fluororibose.
  - Nucleotides with modified bases such as halogenated bases (for
    example 5-bromouracil and 5-iodouracil), alkylated bases (for
    example 7-methylguanosine).

The siRNA can be used as is, i.e., in the form of a double stranded RNA with the aforementioned characteristics. Alternatively, the use of vectors containing the sense and antisense strand sequence of the siRNA is possible under the control of suitable promoters for the expression thereof in the cell of interest.

Vectors suitable for expressing siRNA are those in which the two DNA regions encoding the two strands of siRNA are arranged in tandem in one and the same DNA strand separated by a spacer region which, upon transcription, forms a loop and wherein a single promoter directs the transcription of the DNA molecule giving rise to shRNA.

Alternatively, the use of vectors in which each of the strands forming the siRNA is formed from the transcription of a different transcriptional unit is possible. These vectors are in turn divided into divergent and convergent transcription vectors. In divergent transcription vectors, the transcriptional units encoding each of the DNA strands forming the siRNA are located in tandem in a vector such that the transcription of each DNA strand depends on its own promoter which may be the same or different (Wang, J. et al., 2003, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 100:5103-5106 and Lee, N. S., et al., 2002, Nat. Biotechnol., 20:500-505). In convergent transcription vectors, the DNA regions giving rise to the siRNA form the sense and antisense strands of a DNA region which are flanked by two reverse promoters. After the transcription of the sense and antisense RNA strands, the latter will form the hybrid for forming a functional siRNA. Vectors with reverse promoter systems in which 2 U6 promoters (Tran, N. et al., 2003, BMC Biotechnol., 3:21), a mouse U6 promoter and a human H1 promoter (Zheng, L., et al., 2004, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 135-140 and WO 2005026322) and a human U6 promoter and a mouse H1 promoter (Kaykas, A. and Moon, R., 2004, BMC Cell Biol., 5:16) are used have been described.

Promoters suitable for use thereof in the expression of siRNA from convergent or divergent expression vectors include any promoter or pair of promoters compatible with the cells in which the siRNA is to be expressed. Thus, promoters suitable for the present invention include but are not necessarily limited to constitutive promoters such as those derived from the genomes of eukaryotic viruses such as the polyoma virus, adenovirus, SV40, CMV, avian sarcoma virus, hepatitis B virus, the metallothionein gene promoter, the thymidine kinase gene promoter of the herpes simplex virus, retrovirus LTR regions, the immunoglobulin gene promoter, the actin gene promoter, the EF-1alpha gene promoter as well as inducible promoters in which the protein expression depends on the addition of a molecule or an exogenous signal such as the tetracycline system, the NFkappaB/UV light system, the Cre/Lox system and the heat shock gene promoter, the regulatable RNA polymerase II promoters described in WO/2006/135436 as well as specific tissue promoters (for example, the PSA promoter described in WO2006012221). In a preferred embodiment, the promoters are RNA polymerase III promoters which act constitutively. The RNA polymerase III promoters are found in a limited number of genes such as 5S RNA, tRNA, 7SL RNA and U6 snRNA. Unlike other RNA polymerase III promoters, type III promoters do not require any intragenic sequence but rather need sequences in 5′ direction comprising a TATA box in positions −34 and −24, a proximal sequence element or PSE between −66 and −47 and, in some cases, a distal sequence element or DSE between positions −265 and −149. In a preferred embodiment, the type III RNA polymerase III promoters are the human or murine H1 and U6 gene promoters. In a yet more preferred embodiment, the promoters are 2 human or murine U6 promoters, a mouse U6 promoter and a human H1 promoter or a human U6 promoter and a mouse H1 promoter.

The siRNA can be generated intracellularly from the so called shRNA (short hairpin RNA) characterized in that the antiparallel strands forming the siRNA are connected by a loop or hairpin region. The shRNAs can be encoded by plasmids or viruses, particularly retroviruses, and are under the control of a promoter. Promoters suitable for expressing shRNA are those indicated in the paragraph above for expressing siRNA.

Vectors suitable for expressing siRNA and shRNA include prokaryotic expression vectors such as pUC18, pUC19, Bluescript and the derivatives thereof, mp18, mp19, pBR322, pMB9, CoIE1, pCR1, RP4, phages and shuttle vectors such as pSA3 and pAT28, yeast expression vectors such as 2-micron plasmid type vectors, integration plasmids, YEP vectors, centromeric plasmids and the like, insect cell expression vectors such as pAC series vectors and pVL series vectors, plant expression vectors such as pIBI, pEarleyGate, pAVA, pCAMBIA, pGSA, pGWB, pMDC, pMY, pORE series vectors and the like and viral vector-based (adenovirus, viruses associated with adenoviruses as well as retroviruses and particularly lentiviruses) higher eukaryotic cell expression vectors or non-viral vectors such as pcDNA3, pHCMV/Zeo, pCR3.1, pEF1/His, pIND/GS, pRc/HCMV2, pSV40/Zeo2, pTRACER-HCMV, pUB6/V5-His, pVAX1, pZeoSV2, pCI, pSVL and pKSV-10, pBPV-1, pML2d and pTDT1. In a preferred embodiment, the vectors are lentiviral vectors.

The siRNA and shRNA of the invention can be obtained using a series of techniques known by the person skilled in the art. The region of the nucleotide sequence taken as a basis for designing the siRNA is not limiting and it may contain a region of the coding sequence (between the start codon and the end codon) or it may alternatively contain sequences of the non-translated 5′ or 3′ region preferably between 25 and 50 nucleotides long and in any position in 3′ direction position with respect to the start codon. One way of designing an siRNA involves the identification of the AA(N19)TT motifs wherein N can be any nucleotide in the c-MAF gene sequence, and the selection of those having a high G/C content. If said motif is not found, it is possible to identify the NA(N21) motif wherein N can be any nucleotide.

c-MAF specific siRNAs include the siRNA described in WO2005046731 (hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), one of the strands of which is ACGGCUCGAGCAGCGACAA (SEQ ID NO: 6). Other c-MAF specific siRNA sequences include but are not limited to CUUACCAGUGUGUUCACAA (SEQ ID NO: 7), UGGAAGACUACUACUGGAUG (SEQ ID NO: 8), AUUUGCAGUCAUGGAGAACC (SEQ ID NO: 9), CAAGGAGAAAUACGAGAAGU (SEQ ID NO: 10), ACAAGGAGAAAUACGAGAAG (SEQ ID NO: 11) and ACCUGGAAGACUACUACUGG (SEQ ID NO: 12).

**DNA Enzymes**

On the other hand, the invention also contemplates the use of DNA enzymes to inhibit the expression of the c-MAF gene of the invention. DNA enzymes incorporate some of the mechanistic features of both antisense and ribozyme technologies. DNA enzymes are designed such that they recognize a particular target nucleic acid sequence similar to the antisense oligonucleotide, nevertheless like the ribozyme they are catalytic and specifically cleave the target nucleic acid.

**Ribozymes**

Ribozyme molecules designed for catalytically cleaving transcription products of a target mRNA to prevent the translation of the mRNA which encodes c-MAF the activity of which is to be inhibited, can also be used. Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing specific RNA cleaving. (For a review, see, Rossi, Current Biology 4: 469-471, 1994). The mechanism of ribozyme action involves a specific hybridization of a ribozyme molecule sequence to a complementary target RNA followed by an endonucleolytic cleavage event. The composition of the ribozyme molecules preferably includes one or more sequences complementary to the target mRNA and the well known sequence responsible for cleaving the mRNA or a functionally equivalent sequence (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,246).

The ribozymes used in the present invention include hammer-head ribozymes, endoribonuclease RNA (hereinafter “Cech type ribozymes”) (Zaug et al., Science 224:574-578, 1984.

The ribozymes can be formed by modified oligonucleotides (for example to improve the stability, targeting, etc.) and they should be distributed to cells expressing the target gene in vivo. A preferred distribution method involves using a DNA construct which “encodes” the ribozyme under the control of a strong constitutive pol III or pol II promoter such that the transfected cells will produce sufficient amounts of the ribozyme to destroy the endogenous target messengers and to inhibit translation. Since the ribozymes are catalytic, unlike other antisense molecules, a low intracellular concentration is required for its efficiency.

**Inhibitory Antibodies**

In the context of the present invention, “inhibitory antibody” is understood as any antibody capable of binding specifically to the c-MAF protein and inhibiting one or more of the functions of said protein, preferably those related to transcription. The antibodies can be prepared using any of the methods which are known by the person skilled in the art, some of which have been mentioned above. Thus, the polyclonal antibodies are prepared by means of immunizing an animal with the protein to be inhibited. The monoclonal antibodies are prepared using the method described by Kohler, Milstein et al. (Nature, 1975, 256: 495). In the context of the present invention, suitable antibodies include intact antibodies comprising a variable antigen binding region and a constant region, “Fab”, “F(ab′)2” and “Fab′”, Fv, scFv fragments, diabodies, bispecific antibodies, alphabodies, cyclopeptides and stapled peptides. Once antibodies with c-MAF protein binding capacity are identified, those capable of inhibiting the activity of this protein will be selected using an inhibitory agent identification assay.

**Inhibitory Peptides**

As used herein, the term “inhibitory peptide” refers to those peptides capable of binding to the c-MAF protein and inhibiting its activity as has been explained above, i.e., preventing the c-MAF from being able to activate gene transcription.

Negative c-MAF Dominants

Since the proteins from the maf family are capable of homodimerizing and heterodimerizing with other members of the AP-1 family such as Fos and Jun, one way of inhibiting c-MAF activity is by means of using negative dominants capable of dimerizing with c-MAF but lacking the capacity for activating transcription. Thus, the negative c-MAF dominants can be any of the small maf proteins existing in the cell and lacking two-thirds of the amino terminal end containing the transactivation domain (for example, mafK, mafF, mafg and pi 8) (Fujiwara et al (1993) Oncogene 8, 2371-2380; Igarashi et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7615-7624; Andrews et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 11488-11492; Kataoka et al. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2180-2190) (Kataoka et al. (1996) Oncogene 12, 53-62).

Alternatively, the negative c-MAF dominants include c-MAF variants which maintain the capacity for dimerizing with other proteins but lack the capacity for activating transcription. These variants are, for example, those lacking the c-MAF transactivation domain located at the N-terminal end of the protein. Thus, negative c-MAF dominant variants include in an illustrative manner the variants in which at least amino acids 1 to 122, at least amino acids 1-187 or at least amino acids 1 to 257 (by considering the numbering of human c-MAF as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,338, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) have been removed.

The invention contemplates the use of both the negative c-MAF dominant variants and of polynucleotides encoding c-MAF under the operative control of a promoter suitable for expression in target cell. The promoters that can be used for regulating the polynucleotide transcription of the invention can be constitutive promoters, i.e., promoters directing the transcription at a basal level, or inducible promoters in which the transcriptional activity requires an external signal. Constitutive promoters suitable for regulating transcription are, among others, the CMV promoter, the SV40 promoter, the DHFR promoter, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, the 1a elongation factor (EF1a) promoter, the albumin promoter, the ApoA1 promoter, the keratin promoter, the CD3 promoter, the immunoglobulin heavy or light chain promoter, the neurofilament promoter, the neuron specific enolase promoter, the L7 promoter, the CD2 promoter, the myosin light chain kinase promoter, the HOX gene promoter, the thymidine kinase promoter, the RNA polymerase II promoter, the MyoD gene promoter, the phosphoglyceratekinase (PGK) gene promoter, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) promoter, the actin gene promoter. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter regulating the expression of the transactivator is the PGK gene promoter. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter regulating the polynucleotide transcription of the invention is the RNA polymerase promoter of the T7 phage.

Preferably, the inducible promoters that can be used in the context of the present invention are those responding to an inducer agent showing zero or negligible basal expression in the absence of an inducer agent and are capable of promoting the activation of gene located in the 3′ position. Depending on the type of inducer agent, the inducible promoters are classified as Tet on/off promoters (Gossen, M. and H. Bujard (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5547-5551; Gossen, M. et al., 1995, Science 268:1766-1769; Rossi, F. M. V. and H. M. Blau, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:451-456); Pip on/off promoters (U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,813); antiprogestin-dependent promoters (US 2004132086), ecdysone-dependent promoters (Christopherson et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:6314-6318; No et al., 1996, Proc. Natl.

Other c-MAF inhibitors are described in the patent application WO2005063252, such as shown in the following table (Table 2).

In a preferred embodiment, the c-MAF inhibitory agents are used for the treatment and/or prevention of bone metastasis. In a yet more preferred embodiment, the bone metastasis is osteolytic metastasis.

The c-MAF inhibitory agents are typically administered in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

The term “carrier” refers to a diluent or an excipient whereby the active ingredient is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oil, including those of a petroleum, animal, plant or synthetic origin such peanut oil, soy oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Water or aqueous saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions, particularly for injectable solutions, are preferably used as carriers. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin, 1995. Preferably, the carriers of the invention are approved by the state or federal government regulatory agency or are listed in the United States Pharmacopeia or other pharmacopeia generally recognized for use thereof in animals and more particularly in human beings.

The carriers and auxiliary substances necessary for manufacturing the desired pharmaceutical dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention will depend, among other factors, on the pharmaceutical dosage form chosen. Said pharmaceutical dosage forms of the pharmaceutical composition will be manufactured according to the conventional methods known by the person skilled in the art. A review of the different methods for administering active ingredients, excipients to be used and processes for producing them can be found in “Tratado de Farmacia Galénica”, C. Faulí i Trillo, Luzán 5, S. A. 1993 Edition. Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid composition (tablets, pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or liquid composition (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) for oral, topical or parenteral administration. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition may contain, as deemed necessary, stabilizers, suspensions, preservatives, surfactants and the like.

For use in medicine, the c-MAF inhibitory agents can be found in the form of a prodrug, salt, solvate or clathrate, either isolated or in combination with additional active agents and can be formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Excipients preferred for use thereof in the present invention include sugars, starches, celluloses, rubbers and proteins. In a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention will be formulated in a solid pharmaceutical dosage form (for example tablets, capsules, pills, granules, suppositories, sterile crystal or amorphous solids that can be reconstituted to provide liquid forms etc.), liquid pharmaceutical dosage form (for example solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, lotions, ointments etc.) or semisolid pharmaceutical dosage form (gels, ointments, creams and the like). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered by any route, including but not limited to the oral route, intravenous route, intramuscular route, intraarterial route, intramedularry route, intrathecal route, intraventricular router, transdermal route, subcutaneous route, intraperitoneal route, intranasal route, enteric route, topical route, sublingual route or rectal route. A review of the different ways for administering active ingredients, of the excipients to be used and of the manufacturing processes thereof can be found in Tratado de Farmacia Galénica, C. Faulí i Trillo, Luzán 5, S. A., 1993 Edition and in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (A. R. Gennaro, Ed.), 20th edition, Williams & Wilkins PA, USA (2000). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are known in the state of art and include phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsions, different types of wetting agents, sterile solutions, etc. The compositions comprising said carriers can be formulated by conventional processes known in the state of the art.

In the event that nucleic acids (siRNA, polynucleotides encoding siRNA or shRNA or polynucleotides encoding negative c-MAF dominants) are administered the invention contemplates pharmaceutical compositions particularly prepared for administering said nucleic acids. The pharmaceutical compositions can comprise said naked nucleic acids, i.e., in the absence of compounds protecting the nucleic acids from degradation by the nucleases of the body, which entails the advantage that the toxicity associated with the reagents used for transfection is eliminated. Administration routes suitable for naked compounds include the intravascular route, intratumor route, intracranial route, intraperitoneal route, intrasplenic route, intramuscular route, subretinal route, subcutaneous route, mucosal route, topical route and oral route (Templeton, 2002, DNA Cell Biol., 21:857-867). Alternatively, the nucleic acids can be administered forming part of liposomes conjugated to cholesterol or conjugated to compounds capable of promoting the translocation through cell membranes such as the Tat peptide derived from the HIV-1 TAT protein, the third helix of the homeodomain of the D. melanogaster antennapedia protein, the herpes simplex virus VP22 protein, arginine oligomers and peptides as described in WO07069090 (Lindgren, A. et al., 2000, Trends Pharmacol. Sci, 21:99-103, Schwarze, S. R. et al., 2000, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 21:45-48, Lundberg, M et al., 2003, Mol Therapy 8:143-150 and Snyder, E. L. and Dowdy, S. F., 2004, Pharm. Res. 21:389-393). Alternatively, the polynucleotide can be administered forming part of a plasmid vector or viral vector, preferably adenovirus-based vectors, in adeno-associated viruses or in retroviruses such as viruses based on murine leukemia virus (MLV) or on lentivirus (HIV, FIV, EIAV).

The c-MAF inhibitory agents or the pharmaceutical compositions containing them can be administered at a dose of less than 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, preferably less than 5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, 0.00005 or 0.00001 mg per kg of body weight. The unit dose can be administered by injection, inhalation or topical administration.

The dose depends on the severity and the response of the condition to be treated and it may vary between several days and months or until the condition subsides. The optimal dosage can be determined by periodically measuring the concentrations of the agent in the body of the patient. The optimal dose can be determined from the EC50 values obtained by means of previous in vitro or in vivo assays in animal models. The unit dose can be administered once a day or less than once a day, preferably less than once every 2, 4, 8 or 30 days. Alternatively, it is possible to administer a starting dose followed by one or several maintenance doses, generally of a lesser amount than the starting dose. The maintenance regimen may involve treating the patient with a dose ranging between 0.01 μg and 1.4 mg/kg of body weight per day, for example 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or 0.00001 mg per kg of body weight per day. The maintenance doses are preferably administered at the most once every 5, 10 or 30 days. The treatment must be continued for a time that will vary according to the type of disorder the patient suffers, the severity thereof and the condition of the patient. After treatment, the progress of the patient must be monitored to determine if the dose should be increased in the event that the disease does not respond to the treatment or the dose is reduced if an improvement of the disease is observed or if unwanted side effects are observed.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

**Clinical Relevance and Prognostic Value of c-MAF and 16q22-24 to Identify Patients at Risk of Metastasis, in Particular Bone Metastasis**

c-MAF was tested in different lung cancer patient sample cohorts. The first including gene expression profiles and clinical annotations for metastasis that contain the transcriptome of lung cancer primary tumors and a second cohort based on lung tumor biopsies in the form of a tissue microarray and the clinical annotations for time to bone metastasis and overall survival. These tumors are representative of all lung cancer subtypes and stages. In the first cohort, the expression of c-MAF gene is correlated with clinical parameters including time to metastasis. Similarly, the second set (n=74) of lung primary tumor biopsies for which the clinical annotation for bone relapse and overall survival post primary tumor diagnosis was used to determine, the levels of c-MAF protein expression and 16q23 genomic gain by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization using a c-MAF specific antibody and a c-MAF locus specific FISH probe and the association between the levels of c-MAF expression and 16q23 genomic gain and risk of bone relapse is established.

**Patient Cohort I**

We did the appropriate statistical analysis to see if MAF expression in these tumors correlates with metastasis. We used a cohort of lung primary tumors, including EGFR and KRAS mutants and SCLC and NSCLC. The patients' information was extracted from:


- Chitale D, Gong Y, Taylor B S, Broderick S, Brennan C, Somwar R, Golas
  B, Wang L, Motoi N, Szoke J, Reinersman J M, Major J, Sander C, Seshan
  V E, Zakowski M F, Rusch V, Pao W, Gerald W, Ladanyi M. “An integrated
  genomic analysis of lung cancer reveals loss of DUSP4 in EGFR-mutant
  tumors.” Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2773-83.  
  All statistical analyses were performed in R using Bioconductor
  (Gentleman et al. (2004)).  
  We adjusted Cox Proportional Hazards Models (using the R function
  coxph from Packaged survival) to see if we could explain metastasis
  phenotype through MAF expression. C-MAF had a statistically
  significant effect (Using three independent probes specific for c-MAE
  in affymetrix arrays), Gene expression of c-MAF in lung primary tumors
  correlated significantly with metastasis as its observed in kaplan
  meier plot and is highlighted by the HR and the p-value obtained (FIG.
  1). Patient cohort II

Similarly, a dataset of (74) lung primary tumors for which the clinical annotation for bone relapse post primary tumor diagnosis is available is secured, the levels of c-MAF are determined by immunohistochemistry using a c-MAF specific antibody and the association between the levels of c-MAF expression and risk of bone relapse is established. The samples from the second paraffin embedded primary tumor tissue from lung cancer patients. These samples were collected by Vail d'Hebron Oncology Institute during its clinical practice together with the relevant clinical data needed and the approval of the clinical committee.

The samples were selected fulfill the following requests:

9 samples belonged to patients with local disease (MO) at diagnosis with a confirmed bone relapse at any time of follow-up.

49 samples belonged to patients at diagnosis that remain metastasis free after at least 5 years.

The remaining 16 tumors are from patients MO at diagnosis that latter had a relapse in any location other than bone.

### Example 2

**c-MAF Gene Expression is Associated with Risk of Metastasis, in Particular Bone Metastasis, in Lung Cancer**

Expression of c-MAF bone metastasis genes was correlated with clinical parameters including metastasis using the above described lung cancer expression data set. As described in FIG. 1, c-MAF expression was associated to high risk of metastasis. Following a standard statistical analysis we showed that MAF expression in these tumors significantly correlates with metastasis. A cohort of lung primary tumors, including EGFR and KRAS mutants and SCLC and NSCLC were used. All statistical analyses were performed using Bioconductor (Gentleman et al. (2004)).

The Cox Proportional Hazards Models were adjusted (using the R function coxph from Packaged survival) to see if we could explain metastasis phenotype through MAF expression. c-MAF had a statistically significant effect (Using three independent probes specific for c-MAF in affymetrix arrays). Gene expression of c-MAF in lung primary tumors correlated significantly with metastasis as its observed in kaplan meier plot and is highlighted by the HR and the p-value obtained (FIG. 1). Tumors were classified according to three groups of c-MAF expression, high (>+1 standard deviation of the mean), medium (<+1 standard deviation of the mean and >−1 standard deviation of the mean) and low (<−1 standard deviation of the mean).

### Example 3

**c-MAF Expression is Associated with Risk of Bone Metastasis**

Immunohistochemistry Analysis

cMAF immunostaining was performed on plus charged glass slides in a Dako Link platform. After deparaffination, antigen retrieval was performed. Endogenous peroxidase is quenched. A anti-c-MAF antibody was used, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody coupled with preoxidase. C-MAF immunostaining is scored by a computerized measurement.

Prognostic and Predictive Value of c-MAF for Metastasis and Bone Metastasis in Lung Cancer

The prognostic and predictive value of c-MAF expression for metastasis of lung cancer was evaluated. C-MAF protein levels were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). MAF immunostaining was scored by a computerized measurement. Nine representative images from each specimen were acquired at 10-nm wavelength intervals between 420 and 700 nm, using a DM2000 Leica microscope equipped with the Nuance FX Multispectral Imaging System (CRI Inc). Before acquiring a spectral dataset of an image, an autoexposure routine was performed while imaging a blank area of slides to determine the exposure time necessary to approximately 90% fill the device wells at each wavelength to compensate for variations in source intensity, filter transmission efficiency and camera sensitivity. A library of pure DAB and Hematoxylin dye colors was created and used to unmix the colors using the Nuance 1.6.4 software. A cube (stack of images taken at the different wavelengths) of reference was then acquired for each new case, followed by spectral imaging of three representative tissue fields using the same exposure times. After deconvolution of the images, the spectral data was flat fielded to compensate for unevenness in illumination and background was filtered. The positive signals were converted from transmission to optical density units by taking the negative log of the ratio of the sample divided by the reference cube using a Beer law conversion. A computer-aided threshold was set, which creates a pseudo-color image that highlights all of the positive signals. Analysis yielded quantitative data of c-MAF from the average intensity of regions of interest. Only the nuclei of epithelial cells (normal and malignant), but not stromal cells or lymphocytes, were automatically detected by setting distinct size threshold and confirmed by a pathologist. Each case was calculated for the mean value of the signal intensity of all regions of interest for statistical analysis. The output of the computerized measurement produced a continuous data ranging from 1160 to 99760 optical density units (O.D.) for c-MAF expression. The cut off (20000 O.D.) for high an low expression was determined based on a receiving operating curve as per standard procedures (AUC 0.802). The results are summarized in Table 3.

Based on this values the odds ratio of risk of suffering bone metastasis in the c-MAF high group versus the low was OR (bone metastasis at any time)=53.37 (95% C.I. 8.24-345.92)

Next the time to bone progression of the overall population of the study was confirmed (FIG. 2a) and next the probability of bone metastasis at any time survival-free of the two groups was evaluated (FIG. 2b). Interestingly, in the cohort of study, the c-MAF high expressing tumors have a smaller overall survival than those expressing low levels.

Based on the second cohort analyzed, diagnostic clinical features were extracted. C-MAF high level expression predicts bone metastasis with a sensitivity of 0.778, a specificity of 0.938, a positive predictive value of 63.6%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%.

The c-MAF gene or protein expression in lung tumors correlates significantly with metastasis and bone metastasis at any time.

### Example 4

**16q22-q24 (Includes c-MAF Gene) Chromosome Amplification Predicts and is a Prognostic Indicator of Risk of Metastasis, in Particular Bone Metastasis, in Lung Cancer**

Next, we determined whether a gain in chr16q22-q24, which includes the c-MAF gene locus, is associated with risk of bone metastasis in lung cancer patients. To this end a 16q23 14q32 dual fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe that identifies chr16q22-q24 amplifications was used to measure the number of copies of the 16q22-24 region. The 14q32 probe was also used to normalize tumor polyploidy.

The prognostic and predictive value of 16q22-24 CNA gain association with bone metastasis in lung cancer was evaluated. 16q23 and 14q32 copies were determined by FISH. The slides were incubated with 16q23 MAF and 14q32IGH probe mixture. This SpectrumOrange probe flanks the MAF gene region and is composed of two segments that are each approximately 350 kb with an approximately 2.2 Mb gap. The centromeric segment is located at chr16:75729985-76079705 (March 2006 assembly, UCSC Genome Browser) and the telomeric segment is located at chr16:78290003-78635873 (March 2006 assembly, UCSC Genome Browser). This probe flanks five genes VAT1L, CLEC3A, WWOX, 5srRNA and MAF (ordered from centromer to telomer). In parallel, a CEP16 (centromeric chr 16) probe (Abbot) was used to determine the CNA. CEP16 (16q11.2)(Abbot) probe was used to score 16q23 CNA. DAPI counterstain was applied and images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope.

The results are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

Based on these values the odds ratio of risk of suffering bone metastasis in the 16q22-24 gain or CNA gain positive group versus the negative was calculated. Since there were no patients with bone metastasis that score negative for the determination and in order to avoid errors on the estimation, as per standard statistical procedures (Glas, A. S. et al., 2003, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 56, 1129-1135), 0.5 units were added to each value and recalculated the parameter. Based on this estimation, the OR for the 16q22-24 gain positive patients to suffer a bone metastasis was 62.63 (95% CI 3.42-1147.78), and the OR for the 16q22-24 CNA gain normalized using 14q32 positive patients versus the control was 225.89 (95% CI 11.22-4546.99). The small size of the cohort made the estimates imprecise but within a clinically relevant OR of least 3.42 and 11.22 in each case.

Based on the data using FISH in order to measure 16q23 gains, diagnostic clinical features were extracted. 16q22-24 gain (>=2.5 copies per cell) predicts lung cancer patients at high risk of bone metastasis with a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.772, a positive predictive value of 40.9%, and a negative predictive value of 100.0%.

Based on the data using FISH in order to measure 16q23 gains normalized to 14q32 copies, diagnostic clinical features were extracted. 16q22-24 CNA gain (>=1.5 16q23 copies per cell normalized to 14q32) predicts lung cancer risk of bone metastasis with a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.930, a positive predictive value of 69.2%, and a negative predictive value of 100.0%.

The 16q22-24, and particularly 16q23, amplification/gain or CNA gain in lung tumors strongly predicts and is associated with risk of bone metastasis at any time.
