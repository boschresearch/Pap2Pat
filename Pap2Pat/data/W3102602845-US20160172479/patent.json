    "abstract": "High electron mobility leads to better device performance and today is achieved by fabricating \u201cgated devices\u201d within a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG. However, the fabrication techniques used to form these devices lead to rapid degradation of the 2DEG quality which then can limits the mobility of the electronic devices.

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "One of the most important recent developments in semiconductors, both from the point of view of physics and for the purpose of device developments, has been the achievement of structures in which the electronic behavior is essentially two-dimensional (2D). This means that, at least for some phases of operation of the device, the carriers are confined in a potential such that their motion in one direction is restricted and thus is quantized, leaving only a two-dimensional momentum which characterizes motion in a plane normal to the confining potential. The major systems where such 2D behavior has been studied are MOS and HEMT structures, quantum wells and superlattices. More recently, quantization has been achieved in 1-dimension through the formation of quantum wires and in zero\u201d dimensions through the use of quantum dots.",
                        "In the past 30 years there has been considerable research involving 2D electronic gases (2DEGs) and 2D hole gases (2DHGs), and much continues to this day. 2DEGs due to their presence in transistor like structures formed from semiconductors have offered researchers a mature system for providing extremely high mobility electrons, especially at low temperatures. When cooled to 4K, 2DEGs may have mobilities of the order of 1,000,000 cm2/Vs and even lower temperatures can lead to further increases in mobility. Specially grown, state of the art heterostructures with mobilities around 30,000,000 cm2/Vs have been made, see for example A. Kumar et al in \u201cNon-Conventional Odd-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States in the Second Landau Level\u201d (Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 105, 246808, 2010). These enormous mobilities have provided a test bed for exploring fundamental physics, such as for example the first demonstration of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, since besides confinement and effective mass, the electrons do not interact with the semiconductor very often. For reference mobilities in 2DHG systems are smaller than those of most 2DEG systems, in part due to larger effective masses of holes, such that a few 1,000 cm2/Vs are already considered high mobility.",
                        "Electrical conductivity is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration and accordingly the same conductivity can come from a small number of electrons with high mobility for each, or a large number of electrons with a small mobility for each. For metals, it would not typically matter which of these is the case, since most metal electrical behavior depends on conductivity alone. Therefore, mobility is relatively unimportant in metal physics. On the other hand, for semiconductors, the behavior of transistors and other devices can be very different depending on whether there are many electrons with low mobility or few electrons with high mobility and accordingly, mobility is a very important parameter for semiconductor materials where almost always, higher mobility leads to better device performance, with other things equal. As within a semiconductor device the same electrical conductivity can be derived from a small device geometry with a low number of high mobility electrons and a large device geometry with a large number of low mobility electrons. Accordingly, 2DEGs allow for smaller device geometries and faster devices.",
                        "At the same time the realization of the split gate opened up the possibility to observe several new quantum effects in electron transport generating a field of research on its own. Amongst split gates is the quantum point contact (QPC), whereby a narrow constriction with a tunable width comparable to the Fermi wavelength is fabricated on a 2DEG. The QPC led to the observation of one-dimensional ballistic transport, a regime where the conductance is quantized in even steps of 2 e2/h as a function of the constriction width. QPCs have not only allowed research into ballistic quantum transport and mesoscopic physics but today very similar fabrication techniques are employed to fabricate devices for studying electronic transport in quantum dots, electron interferometers, and phase-coherent mesoscopic circuits.",
                        "Further, when the electron mobility within a 2DEG exceeds \u02dc105 cm2/V\u00b7s additional quantum effects can arise within a magnetic field, such as the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) effect. This counter-intuitive phenomenon involves the two-dimensional system acquiring fractional effective charges, quantum statistics and quantum numbers, all driven by electron-electron interactions. This is in stark contrast with the Integer Quantum Hall (IQH) effect whose emergence does not involve any interactions and consequently is much more robust against disorder.",
                        "Whilst detrimental to the electronic mobility of its 2DEG, split gates fabricated on high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures have led to important insights. For instance, shot noise measurements were used to determine effective charges in FQH circuits, electron interferometry with FQH quasiparticles is now performed in Fabry-Perot, and/or Mach-Zehnder interferometers which are electronic equivalent to those used in optics.",
                        "However, a significantly limitation is the processing required to fabricate these gates, which results in unwanted degradation of the electron mobility. This is particularly damaging for delicate many-body quantum states such as the 5/2 and 12/5 FQH states. These states are unusual in that their quantum statistics is believed to emanate from a non-Abelian lineage, but unfortunately their small energy many-body gaps of \u02dc500 mK and \u02dc50 mK respectively are affected by disorder of any kind. As such, it has been difficult thus far to study these states in gated structures to date except for a limited number of tour de force experiments performed on the 5/2 FQH state.",
                        "Within the prior art the approaches to fabricating a \u201cgated device\u201d with a high-mobility 2DEG, such as those found in MOSFETs, HEMTs, etc. exploit direct lithography, be it photolithography or e-beam lithography, directly on the high-quality wafer where the 2DEG is to be formed. However, these techniques lead to rapid degradation of the 2DEG quality during processing which then can limits the mobility of the electronic devices. Accordingly, it would be beneficial to provide a process/technique which circumvents this processing and 2DEG layer damage within the region of the wafer comprising the 2DEG layer being exploited. The inventors have established a methodology exploiting a first substrate, e.g. silicon, upon which the required lithography processing etc are performed which is then connected to a second substrate, supporting a semiconductor structure providing a 2DEG under defined operating conditions. This connection being achieved through bringing the surface of the second substrate with the 2DEG layer into contact with the surface of the first substrate supporting metallization to apply the electric field to the 2DEG layer. Advantageously this offers the advantage that no processing at all is performed on the 2DEG wafer, offering possibilities for much higher-quality high-mobility devices. Furthermore, the same sets of \u201cgates\u201d, or same device, can sequentially be used on distinct high-mobility wafers. Accordingly, rather than throwing away expensive high-quality wafers, the design methodology of the inventors requires patterning of lower cost wafers, such as silicon, which are also easier to control in terms of manufacturing by exploiting standard high volume semiconductor manufacturing techniques. For example, the technique can be used to provide a low-noise high-frequency pre-amplifier HEMT, which is found in essentially every portable electronic device supporting wireless communications without requiring a discrete amplifier die in conjunction with a silicon integrated circuit.",
                        "To the best knowledge of the inventors there has been no technique reported within the prior art fabricating gated electronic devices entirely free of lithography and processing on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) wafer. The technique of the inventors allows silicon substrates, silicon CMOS electronics, and other associated low cost high volume manufacturing rather than custom-grown molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) material that is extremely expensive to grow. Beneficially, the technique also allows for device designs and geometries to be tested on a distinct 2DEG wafer since the devices can be removed from the 2DEG wafer, and replaced with another one. Conversely, several 2DEG materials with different specifications can be tested on a given device design and geometry allowing for rapid prototyping and development. Beneficially the technique is fully compatible with modern high volume foundries. Potentially the technique also allows for low cost integration methodologies for 1D and \u201czero\u201d D electron gas structures.",
                        "According to extensions of the technique two or more different semiconductor materials or material systems may be employed in conjunction with one or more electronic circuits to provide 2DEG enabled circuits in 2D and/or 3D stacked configurations. Further semiconductor materials providing EG elements may incorporate one or more of 2DEG, 1DEG, and \u201czero\u201d DEG structures.",

Rather, the ensuing description of the exemplary embodiment(s) will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an exemplary embodiment. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope as set forth in the appended claims.",
                        "Amongst the useful and versatile structures for electronics is the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) layered structures, the most important of these being the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures. For a gate voltage VG=0 (the flat-band case) there are (ideally) no charge layers, and the energy levels of the metal (M) and semiconducting (S) regions line up to yield the same Fermi level. Considering the base region to be doped p-type then for a negative gate voltage, VG<0 and electric field is set up in the oxide causing the Si bands to bend up at the oxide interface so that the Fermi level is closer to the valence-band edge. Thus extra holes accumulate at the semiconductor-oxide interface and electrons accumulate at the metal-oxide interface. With the gate voltage positive, VG>0, but less than some threshold voltage, VT, which is defined as the gate voltage where the intrinsic Fermi level and the actual Fermi level are coincident at the interface then the Si bands bend down at the interface resulting in a depletion of holes, and a negatively charged layer of localized states is formed at the semiconductor-oxide interface. The size of this \u201cdepletion region\u201d increases as VG increases. The corresponding positively charged region at the metal-oxide interface is also shown. Finally, for VG>VT the intrinsic Fermi level at the interface drops below the actual Fermi level, forming the \u201cinversion layer\u201d, where mobile electrons reside.",
                        "Accordingly, the electric field induced from the gate voltage dramatically changes the conducting properties of the carriers beneath the gate. Use of this effect is exploited within a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). However, it is the electrons in this inversion layer which are of interest, both because they can be confined so as to exhibit two-dimensional behavior, and because they can be controlled by the gate voltage in the MOSFET. Accordingly, a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) is formed at the interface between the oxide and the p-type silicon substrate.",
                        "Other systems where two-dimensional behavior has been observed include heterojunctions of III-V compounds such as GaAs/Ga1-xAlxAs, layer compounds such as GaSe, GaSe2 and related III-VI compounds, graphite and intercalated graphite. For example, within a GaAs High-Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) exploiting a modulation doped GaAs/Ga1-xAlxAs on a GaAs substrate, yielding high electron mobility and high sheet density, wherein the 2DEG is formed in the undoped GaAs at the interface to the p-type doped AlGaAs. GaAs/Ga1-xAlxAs heterojunctions are particularly important for device applications because the lattice constants and the coefficients of expansion of both GaAs and GaAs/Ga1-xAlxAs are very similar. This lattice matching permits the growth of high mobility thin films of Ga1-xAlxAs on a GaAs substrate with low defect density, low stress, and low temperature dependence.",
                        "The principles of lithography, either by exposing light or an electron beam, are well-known and well-established. Using these techniques, in particular optically-corrected photolithography, the semiconductor electronics industry has progressed to the point today where it can provide microprocessors with millions of transistors operating at gigahertz (GHz) speeds exploiting transistors with dimensions of the order of \u02dc30 nm on a conventional silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platform. Further, these devices are available in high volume at cost points compatible with consumer electronics such as laptop computers and personal computers. Conversely, during the same period there has been substantial research and large growth within the semiconductor industry of manufacturing techniques, semiconductor material growth, etc for the production of electronic devices not based on silicon. This is, in large part because other semiconductor materials, such as GaAs and InAs, for example, have intrinsic materials properties that can provide devices with strong advantages over the more conventional silicon-based device technologies. For example, High-Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) device structures fabricated using GaAs/GaAlAs modulation-doped semiconductor wafers and conventional optical lithography very similar to that used for silicon-based technologies provide, as a result of the 2DEG within the undoped GaAs at the interface to the p-type doped AlGaAs higher mobility and accordingly higher operating frequencies allowing them to be used in fabricating front end high-frequency amplifiers for wireless consumer electronics for example as well as application in communications and radar systems.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1 there is depicted a schematic of an exemplary process flow for fabricating a HEMT, MOSFET, FET or other electronic device designs according to the prior manufacturing art to provide gated devices exploiting 2DEG layers buried inside a semiconductor material. Accordingly, in step 110 a semiconductor wafer comprising a substrate and semiconductor structure comprising a plurality of layers is fabricated. Subsequently, in step 120 a metallization layer is deposited atop the semiconductor structure which is then patterned with photoresist or other material using a photolithography process in step 130. The metallization layer is then etched in step 140 to yield the required electrode structure atop the semiconductor structure such that the electrode structure and semiconductor structure combine to provide the 2DEG based electronic device. An optical micrograph of a fabricated device is depicted in image 150. It would be evident to one skilled in the art that alternate manufacturing methodologies may be employed without departing from the scope of the invention such as for example using lift-off rather than etching.",
                        "Whilst this manufacturing methodology is essentially simple as it overlaps to conventional semiconductor manufacturing methodology the approach has the drawback that the drawback that the 2DEG material must be exposed to chemicals and lithographic treatment during the device fabrication. As the 2DEG layer may be only nanometers to hundreds of nanometers deep from the surface this leads to two major negative outcomes. First, as is well-known in the GaAs semiconductor community, processing tends to lower the mobility of the 2DEG and so as a result lower the performance of the device. Secondly, this approach is single shot and non-reversible in that should there be a problem or a fault during the lithographic process, the expensive semiconductor material is lost, and must be thrown away.",
                        "Accordingly, the inventors have established a new method wherein a 2DEG gated device can be fabricated without processing of the device onto the 2DEG materials directly. Rather, according to embodiments of the invention patterning is performed using conventional cheap silicon so that this is exposed to the chemical processing and photolithographic processing. The gated 2DEG device is then formed by bringing into contact the silicon to the high-quality, expensive to grow, 2DEG material. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention therefore overcome both major drawbacks of the prior art manufacturing methodology. Accordingly, the pristine 2DEG material from the growth reactor remains pristine, and it is the low cost high volume silicon which is disposed of when faulty, not the expensive 2DEG semiconductor material. Optionally in other embodiments of the invention the process due to the materials present result in effects such as the van der Waals effect bonding the elements together.",
                        "Such a process is depicted in FIG. 2 wherein in steps 210 through 230 a silicon substrate has metallization deposited, patterned, and etch for form the desired electrical structure. Optionally, the silicon substrate may incorporate silicon electronic circuits, e.g. CMOS circuits, together with the electrical structure. In a separate process the 2DEG semiconductor wafer is fabricated in step 240 and then brought together with the silicon substrate such that the electrical structure of the silicon substrate is in contact with the 2DEG wafer. One or other of the two elements being flipped to mount to the other in step 250. Referring to steps 260 to 280 in FIG. 2 a pair of metallic contacts on a sapphire substrate 290 are depicted which is flipped and brought into contact with a semiconductor substrate and 2DEG semiconductor structure 295, e.g. GaAs\u2014AlGaAs, with Ohmic contacts to form a quantum point contact (QPC) according to an embodiment of the invention.",
                        "Optionally, the 2DEG wafer may have been processed with a low impact process to form pads of a predetermined material, e.g. gold, copper, aluminum etc. that align with patterned materials on the silicon substrate, or other suitable substrate such that if the process is carried out at elevated temperature and/or pressure the two elements are physically bonded. Materials patterned to the silicon substrate for lower temperature bonding may include, for example, indium-silver (InXAg1-X), tin-silver-copper (SnXAgYCu1-(X+Y)) and tin-silver (SnXAg1-X).",

                        "Beneficially, the embodiments of the invention circumvent the issues arising from degradation of the electronic mobility as the processing steps required to fabricate the electrostatic gates are performed on a separate substrate that is then mounted on the surface of the 2DEG substrate. This technique offers several advantages:\n\n\n- - It avoids contamination by chemicals during the fabrication process.\n    Usually, the gate fabrication process uses several steps in which\n    polymer resists are deposited on the surface of the 2DEG and\n    chemicals are used to develop and remove these resists. Even when an\n    appropriate solvent is used, these resist residues are hard to\n    remove and doing so often involves a cleaning process that can\n    damage the 2DEG (e.g. an oxygen plasma). Resist residues can also\n    trap charges and generate undesirable fluctuations in the density of\n    the 2DEG.\n  - It avoids degradation of the electron mobility daring lithography.\n    Radiation damage can arise from heating, electrostatic charging,\n    ionization damages (radiolysis), displacement damage, sputtering and\n    hydrocarbon contamination. In our approach, the 2DEG is never\n    exposed to any electron beam or optical lithography.\n  - It avoids additional strain induced by differential thermal\n    contractions. At room temperature, a 2DEG substrate such as GaAs has\n    a thermal expansion coefficient of \u03b1_(L)=5.8\u00d710\u2076K\u207b\u00b9. Electrostatic\n    gates are typically made with a few nanometers of titanium (TI,\n    \u03b1_(L)=8.6\u00d710\u207b\u2076 K\u207b\u00b9) and/or chromium (Cr, \u03b1_(L)=4.9\u00d710\u207b\u2076 K\u207b\u00b9)\n    adhesion layer, and most often with tens of nanometers of gold (Au,\n    \u03b1_(L)=14\u00d710\u207b\u2076K\u207b\u00b9) or aluminium (Al, \u03b1_(L)=23.1\u00d710\u207b\u2076 K\u207b\u00b9). These\n    coefficients do not vary much from \u02dc300K (down to \u02dc150K) and\n    eventually become negligible at low temperatures. For a typical 2 mm\n    wide gate made out of Au, the gate will shrink by approximately 4 \u03bcm\n    when cooled during the first 150K whereas GaAs will shrink by less\n    than 2 \u03bcm. This is likely to induce strain in the material and to\n    affect the electron mobility at low temperatures, particularly in\n    the case of a narrow constriction with a width of only 500 nm or so.\n  - It makes it possible to re-use the 2DEG material. The technique is\n    non-destructive and enables the re-use of the 2DEG material at will.\n    In addition, for the highest mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs with\n    mobility in excess of 30\u00d710\u2076 cm\u00b2/V\u00b7s, it is known that different\n    parts of the wafer may have different mobilities as well as\n    fluctuations in the electron density. Since several types of gated\n    devices have active areas of only a few \u03bcm\u00b2, should the need arise,\n    the approach of the inventors allows for the device to easily be\n    remounted on a slightly different part of the wafer. This technique\n    also allows one to swap gates so as to measure different devices (or\n    designs) on the exact same piece of material. Finally, it avoids\n    wasting precious material during low-yield processes, which is\n    common when fabricating complex devices.",

This assembly could have been achieved by other techniques, such as wafer bonding or epitaxial lift-off for example, however for the purpose of this proof-of-concept this solution was simple. In the sample holder, two G10 plates were designed as a clamp and were placed on a conventional 16 pin sample holder where eight pins were removed for space. The 2DEG wafer is located on the first G10 plate, base 430, then the flip chip is put upside down on top of the 2DEG.

In the prior art gated device, these gates are patterned directly on the surface of the semiconductor, for example GaAs/AlGaAs although other materials can be used, above the 2DEG which is buried typically 100 nm to 200 nm from the surface. When a suitable negative voltage is applied to these gates, the electrons in the 2DEG underneath are depleted such that with a sufficiently high voltage it allows the flow of electrons within in the QPC to be pinched off completely leading to a zero conductance."

In such material, a 2DEG is trapped at the interface between the two semiconductors approximately 100 nm underneath the surface. This material combination was chosen as this material system is commonly considered to be the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the fabrication of gated devices, however, the techniques according to embodiments of the invention will work with any 2DEG material system. In order to measure the conductance of the 2DEG across the QPC, ohmic contacts were fabricated and whilst there are several means to form ohmic contacts within the prior art, so which can involve lithography, and others not. In the proof of principle devices UV photolithography was employed to fabricate ten contacts in a Hall bar geometry upon the silicon substrate.

Aluminium was selected from a perspective of hardness and cost for the initial trials but due to the formation of a protective oxide may not be suitable in production process flows and design methodologies. Accordingly, it would be evident to one skilled in the art that other electrode metallizations may be employed such as gold for example which is also low hardness. The silicon wafer was a conventional highly doped silicon wafer with 300 nm oxide on top. In general, the flatness of the oxide is better than 1 nm, so there were no issues with the uniformity of the gate profile. Conversely, the 2DEG wafer is close to atomically flat, however to ensure a better contact, the thickness of aluminum deposited was chosen to be relatively large, \u02dc600 nm. Since the aluminium is soft, it allows good contact to be achieved when pressed mechanically against the 2DEG.",

This step was followed by a plasma oxygen cleaning process for the removal of organic impurities. This cleaning step was deemed necessary to have low residues on both surfaces. The 2DEG material and the Si wafer were then carefully assembled, in the cleanroom. To achieve this the 2DEG was placed on the sample holder then the Si wafer with the QPC upside down was positioned on top of the 2DEG.

FIG. 5 depicts the results for the inventive device (solid trace) with Gap=1 \u03bcm and conventional device (dashed curve) with Gap=0.5 \u03bcm. For the p-chip device according to an embodiment of the invention a clear pinch-off, i.e. conductance going to zero, is observed at VPINCH\u02dc\u22129V which is a typical feature of a QPC. This establishes unambiguously that the concept works. The conventional device as indicated above had a gap half that of the inventive device which results in a lower pinch-off voltage. Accordingly, with equivalent gaps it is anticipated that the inventive device performance will be comparable to that of the conventional device. However, it is anticipated that some variations and optimizations in tooling for the fixture, assembly processes, metallization etc may be required to reduce the pinch-off voltage to the design value and/or improve reproducibility of device characteristics."

After exposure and development, 5 nm/150 nm Ti/Au is deposited by e-beam evaporation followed by lift-off and chromium etching. Particular care was taken to obtain high quality lift-of so as to prevent residual metal standing up along the edge, which could cause gate leakage or introducing an undesirable buffer space between the flip-chip gates and the 2DEG. A layer of aluminum oxide (30-100 nm thick) was then deposited to further prevent potential gate leakage. Ohmic contacts are fabricated directly on the GaAs/AlGaAs either by indium diffusion, or by evaporation of Ge/Au/Ni/Au using shadow masking to avoid lithography. The 2DEG wafer is placed on a sample holder and the Ohmic contacts are connected to the contacts of the holder by indium-soldered gold wires.",

Optical interference fringes between the top plate and the flip-chip allow a fine tuning in the alignment of the flip-chip device. All fabrication and assembly steps were performed in a class 100 cleanroom to avoid contamination of the critical interfacing surfaces.",
                                "The inventors fabricated both 1 \u03bcm long QPC and Fabry-Perot gates on sapphire and tested the technique on GaAs/AlGaAs wafers grown at Sandia National Laboratories (Sample A) as well as Princeton University (Sample B). To compare performance of the flip-chip devices according to embodiments of the invention with the best prior art QPC the inventors compare the best device in each case out of 20 fabricated. In many instances, the conductance quantization was not as good as for the flip-chip devices. For the flip-chips mounted on Sample A, several QPCs showed pinch-off with a success rate of approximately 80%. In total, more than 20 devices were tested and pinch-off voltages ranging from \u02dc6V to \u02dc40V determined. For comparison, conventional QPCs (CQPCs) made on a similar wafer to Sample A yielded pinch-off voltages ranging from \u22121.7V to \u22123V, and thus had a superior gate efficiency by a factor ranging from \u02dc3 to 13. The inventors attribute the lower gate efficiency of the flip-chip QPC (FCQPC) to the \u201cair\u201d (vacuum) gap between the flip-chip substrate and the 2DEG. A rough calculation that assumes a pinch-off voltage scaling linearly with the distance between gates and the 2DEGs estimates this gap to be in the range from 50 nm to 200 nm. This gap most likely occurs because the contact area between the 2DEG and the flip-chip gates is over 3.6\u00d72.0 mm2 in area and not perfectly flat. Accordingly, it would be evident that this may be easily improved by reducing the contact area between the two mechanical parts of the device such as through provisioning of electrodes with increased thickness in the vicinity of the QPC only, smaller flip-chip elements etc.",

The data were taken at 25 mK using a similar 2DEG GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure with a moderate mobility of 2\u00d7106 cm2/V\u00b7s (although not coming from the exact same wafer). For both devices, the quantization of the conductance is clearly observed. Whilst the CQPC shows better-defined and more precise conductance plateaus (ballistic behaviour), this likely arises from the shape of the QPCs that were not identical, and because of both the air gap present in the FCQPC and shallowness of the 2DEG modifying the gate-induced electric field profile.",

Further, the inventors have not observed a pronounced hysteresis in the pinch-off curve of the FCQPC devices whereas this undesirable behaviour is often observed in conventional CQPC gated devices. Also depicted in FIG. 2 in the inset is a plot of the conductance of a FCQPC integrated with an ultra-high mobility (\u03bc\u02dc1.0\u00d7107 cm2/V\u00b7s) GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEG and measured at 4K is shown. Albeit with a lower gate efficiency, this data demonstrates that the flip-chip process can be integrated with the highest mobility 2DEG materials.",

Referring to FIG. 7 there is depicted the measured resistance for various configurations within sample A. The Hall resistance, RHALL, measured outside of the interferometer shows good quantization of the IQH plateaus and the 5/3 FQH plateau, as expected for a sample in this range of mobility. Due to the geometry of our design, it is not possible to directly measure RHALL under the interferometer. Accordingly, the inventors measured the diagonal resistance RD, which includes a large longitudinal contribution. Also shown are Rxx outside of the interferometer and RxxT through the interferometer. Again, the device geometry plays a role, since the contacts outside are much closer together and the measured voltage is correspondingly smaller. The fact that RxxT does not reach zero in all of the states and that Rxx does may be due to the flip-chip blocking light from the LED used during the cooling process or to the non-ohm nature of particular contacts. The inventors note that in the quantum Hall regime the conductivity is related to the resistivity by the tensor relations given in Equations (1A) and (1B). As a result, it is difficult to extract them in these experiments as they require the measurement of both RHALL and Rxx all regions of the sample in a well-controlled geometry, which is not the case within the prototype devices employed in demonstrating embodiments of the invention.",
