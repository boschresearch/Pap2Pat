The degradation of the anode material in the battery is advantageously ≦90%, ≦85%, ≦80%, ≦75% or ≦70% of the degradation of the same anode material in the same battery when replacing the electrolyte composition with 6 M aqueous KOH.

The conductivity of the electrolyte composition is advantageously ≧55%, ≧60%, ≧65%≧70% or ≧75% of that of 6 M aqueous KOH.

Degradation is measured for instance via cycle stability of the anode material under operating conditions in a flooded cell. A typical battery cell may be prepared as described in the working Examples. The cell is charged at a current density of 100 mA/g for 5 hours and discharged at a current density of 100 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached, discharged at a current density of 24 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached and finally discharged at a current density of 8 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached. The full discharge capacity is the sum of capacities measured at 100, 24 and 8 mA/g for each cycle.

Degradation is determined after a certain number of cycles, for instance after 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 cycles. Degradation is defined as percent capacity loss per cycle.

Percent capacity loss per cycle is:

\({\frac{{cap}_{high} - {cap}_{low}}{\left( {\eta_{low} - \eta_{high}} \right) \cdot {cap}_{high}} \cdot 100},\)

where

caphigh is the highest value of discharge capacity,

caplow is the lowest value of discharge capacity,

ηhigh is the cycle number of the highest discharge capacity and

ηlow is the cycle number of the lowest discharge capacity.

The ratio of percent capacity loss per cycle when employing an anode material in a flooded cell with a present electrolyte composition to that in a flooded cell with 6 M KOH electrolyte, multiplied by 100, provides the relative degradation percent of the embodiments and claims.

For example, caphigh discharge capacity of an anode material is determined to be 400 mA/g after 1 cycle in a present electrolyte composition. After 10 cycles operation in a present electrolyte composition, caplow is determined to be 350 mA/g. The percent capacity loss per cycle is (400−350)/(9·400)·100=1.39%.

When employing the same anode material in the same flooded cell, replacing the electrolyte composition with 6 M KOH, the discharge capacity is determined to be 400 mA/g after 1 cycle and 200 mA/g after 10 cycles. The percent capacity loss per cycle is (400-200)/(9·400)·100=5.56%.

In this example, the degradation of the anode material in the flooded cell with a present electrolyte composition is 25% of that of the same anode material in the same flooded cell but with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte ((1.39/5.56)·100).

Capacities are suitably measured with an Arbin Instruments Battery Test System or with a Maccor Instruments Battery Test System.

Conductivity is measured with any suitable conductivity device, for example a YSI model 3200 conductivity meter or a digital conductivity meter with a probe produced by TRACEABLE VWR Inc.

All measurements herein, for example degradation, conductivity and concentrations are determined at 25° C. and atmospheric pressure.

## EXAMPLES

About 70 mg of Mg52Ni39Co6Mn3 metal hydride alloy powder prepared by melt-spin and mechanical alloying is compacted onto an expanded nickel substrate with a 10-ton press to form the negative working electrode, approximately 0.2 mm in thickness, without any binder. An aqueous solution one or more hydroxide compounds is prepared as the electrolyte. Two halves of sintered Ni(OH)2 positive electrode, each 1 cm2 in area and 1.5 mm in thickness, are connected by a nickel tab strip and used as the counter electrode.

A piece of grafted polypropylene/polyethylene separator is folded in half twice and sandwiches the negative electrode so that there are two layers of separator on each side thereof. Next, two halves of positive electrode sandwiches the wrapped negative electrode. The electrode assembly is placed into a plastic sleeve, which is then slid into an acrylic cell holder. The sleeve is filled with electrolyte using a pipette. After absorbing for five minutes, the sleeve is filled again with electrolyte so that it is in a flooded cell configuration.

The cell is charged at a current density of 100 mA/g for 5 hours and discharged at a current density of 100 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached, discharged at a current density of 24 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached and finally discharged at a current density of 8 mA/g until a cut-off voltage of 0.9 V is reached. The full discharge capacity is the sum of capacities measured at 100, 24 and 8 mA/g for each cycle.

Degradation is determined over 10 cycles. The percent capacity loss per cycle is determined as outlined previously.

Results are in the table below. The table lists electrolyte compositions with hydroxide compound values in mols/L (M) water. Degradation and conductivity are reported in percent relative to 6 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Low degradation and high conductivity are desired. TeaOH is tetraethylammonium hydroxide. Conductivity is measured with a YSI model 3200 conductivity meter. Capacity is measured with an Arbin Instruments Battery Test System.
