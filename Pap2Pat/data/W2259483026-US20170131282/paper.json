    "title": "Periprostatic adipocytes act as a driving force for prostate cancer progression in obesity",
    "date": "2016-01-12",
    "abstract": "Obesity favours the occurrence of locally disseminated prostate cancer in the periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) surrounding the prostate gland. Here we show that adipocytes from PPAT support the directed migration of prostate cancer cells and that this event is strongly promoted by obesity. This process is dependent on the secretion of the chemokine CCL7 by adipocytes, which diffuses from PPAT to the peripheral zone of the prostate, stimulating the migration of CCR3 expressing tumour cells. In obesity, higher secretion of CCL7 by adipocytes facilitates extraprostatic extension. The observed increase in migration associated with obesity is totally abrogated when the CCR3/CCL7 axis is inhibited. In human prostate cancer tumours, expression of the CCR3 receptor is associated with the occurrence of aggressive disease with extended local dissemination and a higher risk of biochemical recurrence, highlighting the potential benefit of CCR3 antagonists in the treatment of prostate cancer.",

                        "The conditioned medium from 3T3-F442A adipocytes (Ad-CM) significantly promoted the directed migration of all prostate cancer cell lines studied as compared with the negative control using 0% fetal calf serum (FCS). The migration of the most aggressive cell lines, PC-3 and Du-145, was even slightly higher than that observed with 10% FCS (Fig. 1a). As expected, these cells expressed chemokine receptors important for prostate cancer dissemination in humans (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4 and CCR2)9 as well as CCR3 whose function in prostate cancer chemotaxis has been recently described in vitro13 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a).",
                        "Antagonists of these receptors were used to analyse their involvement in Ad-CM-induced migration. The doses used were within the range of IC50 (maximal doses between two- and 2.5-fold IC50) and without toxicity on prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). The highest doses of CXCR4 (AMD3100 (ref. 18)), CXCR1/CXCR2 (SB225002 (ref. 19)) or CCR2 (sc-202525 (ref. 20)) antagonists inhibited the migration of PC-3 cells by 10\u201320% (Fig. 1c). For the CCR2 antagonist, this inhibitory effect was only present at maximal doses and not at the described IC50 (ref. 20). For the CCR1/CCR3 antagonist UCB35625 (ref. 21), a clear dose-dependent effect was found and this effect was the strongest among all the inhibitors used (45% inhibition at 200\u2009nM compared with control). A CCR3 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) gave similar results (50% inhibition compared with control) and migration was unaffected by a mAb against CCR1, which is not expressed by prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1b,d). Use of CXCR2 and CXCR4 neutralizing mAbs also confirmed the results obtained with the pharmacological inhibitors with a decrease of PC-3 migration by 15% and 20%, respectively (Fig. 1d). Combination of both CXCR2 and CXCR4 mAbs inhibited the migration of PC-3 cells by 25% (compared with a 50% inhibition in the presence of CCR3 mAb alone), whereas a 60% decrease was observed in the presence of the three blocking mAbs (CCR3, CXCR2 and CXCR4; Fig. 1d). The combined effect of blocking mAbs appears, therefore, rather additive than synergistic. Similar results were obtained with combination of inhibitors. In all cases, the effect of CCR1/3 antagonist alone was greater than the effect of combination of CXCR1/2, CCR2 and CXCR4 antagonists (Supplementary Fig. 3). Experiments using blocking mAbs and pharmacological inhibitors conducted with Du-145 cells confirmed these results (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). Taken together, these results highlight that CCR3 alone is a master regulator of prostate cancer cells migration towards Ad-CM.",
                        "The CCR3 receptor was expressed in cell lines derived from several tumour models (breast, colon, pancreas and melanoma) that come into contact with surrounding adipose tissue during invasion22 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The migration of these cells in response to Ad-CM was correlated with their aggressiveness. In contrast to prostate cancer cells, inhibition of CCR3 had no effect on the Ad-CM-directed migration of all but one cell line (20% inhibition in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231; Supplementary Fig. 4b). These results were confirmed using CCR3 blocking mAb (Supplementary Fig. 5). Use of pharmacological inhibitors and blocking mAbs showed that both CXCR2 and CXCR4 are predominantly involved in the migration of the other cancer models towards Ad-CM (Supplementary Fig. 5). For example, the CXCR4 blocking mAb inhibits the migration of melanoma or pancreatic cancer cells towards Ad-CM by 40% (Supplementary Fig. 5). These results highlight that the balance between active receptors and secreted chemokines varies from one tumour type to another, with the preferential and specific involvement of CCR3 in prostate cancer."

                        "To detect the CCR3 ligand secreted by adipocytes, we conducted a proteomic analysis of Ad-CM and reproducibly detected six secreted chemokines: CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL12, CCL2, CCL7 and CCL9, whose presence in Ad-CM was validated by ELISA (Supplementary Table 1). CXCL1 and CXCL5 bind to CXCR2, CXCL12 to CXCR4 and CCL2 to CCR2 (Fig. 2a)23. Of note, no ligand for CXCR1 was found in the adipocyte secretome, in accordance with the absence of effect of the CXCR1 blocking mAb on the migration of all the tested models (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Figs 1c and 5). Among the chemokines identified in our proteomic study, only CCL7 has been described as a ligand for CCR3 (ref. 24) (Fig. 2a). Since the secretion of CCL5, another CCR3 ligand, has been described for mammary adipocytes25, we dosed this chemokine by ELISA in Ad-CM. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, the level of CCL5 was almost undetectable in Ad-CM (mean concentration 0.01\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 for 1 \u00d7 105 cells compared with 28.3\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 for CCL7), in accordance with the results of our proteomic analysis. Expression of CCL7 by adipocytes has been only described in one study using the murine pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 (ref. 26). As illustrated by its alternate name, monocyte chemotactic protein 3 (MCP-3), CCL7 was originally shown to recruit monocytes to sites of injury and mediate local inflammatory responses. This chemokine has since been shown to regulate the migration of multiple immune cells, including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, immature dendritic cells, basophils and eosinophils27. CCL7 could also be implicated in the chemotaxis of cancer cells to metastatic sites, although in vivo studies are limited in number and mainly concern gastric and colorectal cancers2829. To our knowledge, the role of CCL7 in the chemotaxis of prostate cancer cells has never been studied.",
                        "A set of results confirmed the role of CCL7 in the migration of prostate cancer cells towards Ad-CM. Prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and Du-145) underwent chemotaxis in response to increasing doses of recombinant CCL7 (Fig. 2b) and their migration was inhibited by CCL7 neutralizing polyclonal antibody (pAb) when Ad-CM was used as a chemoattractant (Fig. 2c). Similar results were obtained with LNCaP and C4-2B, two less aggressive prostate cancer cell lines, highlighting the role of the CCR3/CCL7 axis in the chemotaxis of prostate cancer cells in response to adipocyte secretions (Supplementary Fig. 6). CCL7 was also detected in CM of mouse visceral adipose tissue (mu-VAT-CM) and in that of human PPAT (hu-PPAT-CM; Fig. 2d). The migration of prostate cancer cells towards CM from these primary tissues also depended on the CCR3/CCL7 axis (Fig. 2e). We sought to assess the role of adipose tissue in the CCL7-directed migration of prostate cancer cells. We first verified that prostate cancer cells do not secrete this chemokine (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and that the inhibition of CCR3/CCL7 did not affect cell migration in response to 10% FCS (Supplementary Fig. 7b). Punch biopsy samples of human prostatectomy specimens taken from the PPAT or from inside the prostate gland revealed a strong gradient of CCL7 expression (Fig. 2f), suggesting that CCL7 is secreted by PPAT and passively diffuses to the prostate peripheral zone through the prostate capsule, that has been shown to be a permeable barrier30. Therefore, the gradient of CCL7 found in PPAT will be able to promote the directed migration of invasive tumour cells expressing the CCR3 receptor."

                        "Obesity is associated with poor outcome in prostate cancer patients56. In obesity, changes in adipocyte size affect the metabolic and endocrine functions of adipose tissue, and infiltration by macrophages contributes to systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. CCL7 has been reported to be over-expressed in adipose tissue in a context of obesity at mRNA levels16 and we confirmed this over-expression in the VAT of obese individuals and mice (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 8a). Leptin and CCL7 expression were correlated, suggesting that CCL7 secretion is related to the hypertrophic state of adipocytes31 (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Using ELISA, we confirmed that the secretion of CCL7 was higher in obese, when compared with lean mu-VAT-CM (Fig. 3b).",
                        "The migration of prostate cancer cells in response to mu-VAT-CM was significantly higher when cells migrate towards CM obtained from the VAT of obese mice compared with that of lean animals (1.9-fold increase; Fig. 3c). Importantly, this effect was totally abrogated when the CCR3/CCL7 axis was inhibited using pharmacological inhibitors or specific blocking mAbs (Fig. 3c). Mature adipocytes and the so-called SVF were then separated to determine the main source of CCL7 secretion in adipose tissue (Fig. 3d). In lean conditions, the secretion of CCL7 was slightly higher in adipocytes than in the SVF, and a dramatic increase of CCL7 expression was observed in obesity only in mature adipocytes (around fivefold increase compared with lean conditions; Fig. 3e). When the secretions of adipocytes isolated from the mu-VAT of obese mice were used as a chemoattractant, the migration of prostate cancer cells was enhanced compared with secretions from adipocytes isolated from lean mice (Fig. 3f). As shown before for whole adipose tissue, the use of pharmacological inhibitors and CCR3/CCL7 blocking m/pAbs completely abrogated the increase of tumour cell migration observed in obesity (Fig. 3f). The SVF fraction has a slight but significant effect on prostate cancer migration. However, this effect was independent of the CCR3/CCL7 axis and obesity (Supplementary Fig. 9). Adipocytes isolated from human PPAT exhibit very short-term survival in culture (<4\u2009h). To circumvent this problem, we derived adipocytes from ex vivo differentiation of progenitors present in the SVF fraction of three patients. These adipocytes secrete CCL7 and use of Ad-CM prepared from these cells supported prostate cancer cells migration in a CCR3-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 10). Comparison of cells differentiated from lean versus obese patients would have been informative in the context of our study.",
                        "Since it has been demonstrated that mature adipocyte CXCL12 secretion (the ligand for CXCR4) is enhanced by obesity32, we investigated the role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in our model. First, we demonstrated that the secretion of CXCL12 in isolated mature adipocytes was only slightly regulated by obesity when compared with CCL7 (1.6-fold increase for CXCL12 and fivefold increase for CCL7; Supplementary Fig. 11a) in accordance with previously published data32. Secretion of CXCL12 was also detected at low levels in the SVF, with a slight enhancement in obesity (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Using the conditioned medium from isolated adipocytes, we further demonstrated that both CXCR4 and CXCL12 blocking mAbs inhibit the migration of PC-3 cells by about 20% in obese, but not lean, conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11b). However, the enhanced chemotaxis towards the secretion of mature adipocytes isolated from obese animals was still observed in the presence of CXCR4/CXCL12 blocking mAbs in opposition to CCR3/CCL7 m/pAbs that completely abrogated this effect (Supplementary Fig. 11c). Thus, obesity increases the directed migration of prostate cancer cells by modulating the secretory pattern of mature adipocytes, this effect being mainly dependent on the CCR3/CCL7 axis."

                        "We sought to investigate the role of CCR3 in human prostate cancer and, to begin with, we studied its expression in a first tissue microarray (TMA) containing 10 normal prostate samples and 91 human prostate cancer annotated with cancer differentiation (Gleason score). CCR3 was expressed in prostate cancer, but not in normal epithelium (Fig. 4a), and its expression was correlated with Gleason score that reflects both the extent of glandular differentiation and the pattern of growth of the tumour in the prostatic stroma (a high score is associated with an aggressive tumour and poor prognosis)33 (Supplementary Table 2). Very interestingly, the proportion of tumours expressing moderate and high levels of CCR3 increased in 4+3 compared with 3+4 Gleason scored tumours. Despite a similar global Gleason score (7), it has been shown that a higher contingent of undifferentiated cells within the tumours (Gleason 4+3) significantly worsens the prognosis as compared with tumours that exhibit a larger differentiated contingent (Gleason 3+4)34.",
                        "We then constructed a second fully annotated TMA from prostatectomy pieces of 101 patients that underwent surgery between 1 February 2010 and 1 December 2011 in the Department of Urology of the University Hospital of Toulouse (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The clinical and biochemical (post-operative serum Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)) outcomes of the patients were updated in March 2015. CCR3 staining was then performed in this second TMA and scored by two pathologists into low-, intermediate- and high-expressing tumours. Stained areas of all tumours were digitalized and protein expression was quantified using ImageJ software plugins to obtain more accurate measures than the traditional evaluation relying on manual scoring3536. We verified that the results obtained were in accordance with the three groups defined by the manual scoring (see Methods section). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4b, CCR3 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score, the size of the undifferentiated component (percentage of tumour classified as Gleason 4 or 5), localization at the peripheral zone of the prostate gland, local extension of the prostate cancer (shown by pT stage), the presence of lymphatic emboli and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Of note, CCR3 was significantly over-expressed in tumours from obese patients (body mass index (BMI) 30\u201335\u2009kg\u2009m\u22122, 7.9 % of the cohort). This result probably indirectly indicates that their surrounding PPAT express higher levels of CCL7 since it has been demonstrated that chemokines are able to regulate the expression of their own receptors37. We sought to enlarge these results linking CCR3 to prognosis by investigating its role in surgical treatment failure defined either by BCR, locoregional recurrence or distant metastases or by the use of adjuvant radiation or hormonal deprivation therapy, criteria that we used in a previous study38. CCR3 values were strongly correlated with surgical treatment failure (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Very interestingly, when compared in patients exhibiting or not surgical treatment failure at 1 year of follow-up within the four Gleason score classes (i.e. < 7, 7 (3+4 or 4+3), >7), CCR3 values were systematically higher in patients with surgical treatment failure regardless of Gleason scores (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Moreover, the differences in CCR3 values were greater in case of favourable Gleason score (<7; Supplementary Fig. 12b). Finally, we observed in a small series of eight patients that CCR3 expression was slightly upregulated in tumour cells present at the invasive front compared with cells from the centre of tumours, this effect being more pronounced in overweight and obese patients (Supplementary Fig. 13). Note that some blood vessels (indicated by blue stars) also express CCR3 but that quantification was only performed in tumour glands (indicated by arrows) under the supervision of two pathologists. These compelling results show for the first time that CCR3 is expressed in prostate cancer and that its expression, amplified in obesity, is correlated both with the occurrence of aggressive prostate cancer, BCR and surgical treatment failure."

                        "We then used an orthotopic graft model in the obesity-sensitive C57BL/6 murine strain3940 to assess the importance of the CCR3/CCL7 axis and its regulation by obesity during prostate cancer dissemination in vivo. Like all prostate cancer cells studied so far, TRAMP-C1P3 expressed the CCR3 receptor but not CCR1 (Fig. 5a). Recombinant CCL7 protein induced the migration of TRAMP-C1P3 cells and inhibition of the CCR3/CCL7 axis impaired their migration towards Ad-CM (Fig. 5b,c). We engineered TRAMP-C1P3 cell lines stably expressing three different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against CCR3 (m4CCR3, m5CCR3 and m6CCR3). CCR3 expression at the cell surface was 27\u201340% lower in these cells than in wild-type cells (wtCCR3; Fig. 5d). Their migration towards Ad-CM was about twofold lower than that of wtCCR3 cells and migration was the most impaired in the m6CCR3 cell line (Fig. 5e). In contrast with wtCCR3 cells, the migration of shCCR3 cells in response to Ad-CM was not affected by the use of the CCR3 inhibitor, UCB35625 (Fig. 5e). Of note, the migration of shCCR3 cells was similar to wt cells when 10% FCS was used as a chemoattractant, highlighting the specificity towards CCR3 of the observed migration defect (Supplementary Fig. 14). Finally, in contrast with shCtrl cells, the migration of m6CCR3 cells in response to mu-VAT-CM from obese or lean mice was similar and was not affected by the inhibition of the CCR3/CCL7 axis (Fig. 5f), highlighting again the key role of this axis in the increased prostate cancer migration observed in conditions of obesity.",
                        "ShCtrl and m6CCR3 cells were injected into the prostate of C57BL/6 mice. After 3 weeks, tumours formed in animals injected with shCtrl cells were significantly larger in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) than in those fed a normal diet (Fig. 6a,b). In both lean and obese conditions, tumours formed in mice injected with cells deficient in m6CCR3 were significantly smaller than in those injected with shCtrl cells (Fig. 6a,b). Furthermore, depletion of CCR3 totally abrogated the differences in tumour size observed between lean and obese mice after injection of the parental cell line. Persistent in vivo CCR3 depletion was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on excised tumours (Fig. 6b). We and others have previously demonstrated that when tumour cells come into contact of adipose tissue, adipocytes disappear, fibroblast-like cells accumulate and a desmoplastic stroma ensues, indicating that a cross-talk promoting the tumour's proliferative and invasive capacities is being established414243. In control tumours, PPAT thickness was smaller in areas in contact with tumour and this tissue was almost completely absent in obese animals (Fig. 6b). The observed differences in tumour size for shCtrl cells between obese and lean mice (Fig. 6a) suggest that the cross-talk between adipocytes and tumour cells is amplified in obesity, leading to increased tumour progression. CCR3-deficient tumours were smaller in size, and the surrounding PPAT was still present and thicker than in control tumours, demonstrating that, in these conditions, adipose tissue is not modified by the tumour. At proximity to CCR3-deficient tumours in obese animals, as expected, adipocytes were hypertrophic compared with those of lean mice, increasing PPAT thickness (Fig. 6b, middle panel). Although we assessed that the short-term (up to 5 days) growth of CCR3-deficient cells was similar to wt cells (Supplementary Fig. 15), we cannot formally exclude that long-term CCR3 depletion intrinsically affects tumour growth and survival. In conclusion, in mouse models, our compelling results show that CCR3 is therefore a major determinant of prostate cancer progression by influencing tumour size and adipose tissue remodelling and that its effect is substantially influenced by obesity."

                "There is increasing evidence in the literature that tumour-surrounding adipocytes might affect tumour progression. When tumour cells invade the adipose tissue, we and others have demonstrated that these invasive cells dramatically impact adipocytes that then exhibit a modified phenotype and specific biological features. We named these adipocytes \u2018Cancer-Associated Adipocytes' (CAA)4344. In turn, CAAs modify cancer cells' characteristics/phenotype leading to more aggressive behaviour characterized by increased proliferative and invasive capacities, mediated by the secretion of proteases, pro-inflammatory cytokines and modulation of cancer cell metabolism42245. Acquisition of a CAA phenotype has been observed in various cancer types, including prostate, and appears to be a general phenomenon22. In vivo, morphological changes and delipidation of adipocytes at proximity to tumours are also observed. When adipose tissue is in contact with tumours, this tissue disappears and is replaced by a desmoplastic reaction424446 (see also Fig. 6b). Reaching the surrounding adipose tissue is therefore a key step in tumour progression. At a clinical level, this switch from a prostate-confined tumour to a locally disseminated cancer is also viewed as a crucial step in the progression of the disease2. Based on our in vitro experiments, we propose that this key step could be controlled by mature adipocytes, which promote the migration of tumour cells to PPAT through chemokine secretion. Ability of tumour cells to migrate towards a chemokine gradient indicates that they have developed a metastatic phenotype (with both migratory and invasive capacities)8. Interestingly, acquisition of this phenotype might be also facilitated by surrounding PPAT that expresses inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (ref. 47), and metalloproteinases48, both favoring the invasive properties of tumour cells495051. We used in vitro and in vivo approaches (murine models) but also human tumours to show that mature adipocytes secrete CCL7, which diffuses through the capsule to the peripheral zone of the prostate. Here CCL7 interacts with the CCR3 receptor to promote cell migration along the chemokine gradient, across the prostate capsule towards PPAT. This axis, with the exception of one in vitro study, has not been previously implicated in cancer52. Hypertrophic adipocytes secrete large amounts of CCL7, which stimulates adipocyte-dependent directed migration, and then, would facilitate extraprostatic extension in obesity (recapitulated in Fig. 7). The observed increase in migration associated with obesity is totally abrogated when the CCR3/CCL7 axis is inhibited, highlighting its key role in this altered condition. Although the effect of the CCR3/CCL7 axis appears predominant in the enhanced migration of prostate cancer cells, our work underlines that other chemokines and their associated receptors, might be involved in prostate cancer directed migration towards adipose tissue. First, we demonstrated that CXCR2 and CXCR4 also contribute to this effect (Fig. 1c,d), and inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis exhibited a slight but significant effect in obese conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Second, in the presence of CXCR2, CXCR4 and CCR3 blocking mAbs, 40% of cells still migrate, highlighting the involvement of other receptors that remain to be identified (Fig. 1d). As reviewed recently53, multiple chemokines and their receptors (including, in addition to the receptors tested in our study, CCR5, CCR7, CCR9, CXCR3, CXCR5 and CXCR7) are involved in prostate cancer directed migration. These additional receptors could therefore deserve further investigation in our model. Although not investigated in a context of obesity, a previous study demonstrated that the homing of ovarian cancer cells to the omentum (a large fat pad that extends from the stomach and covers the bowel and the most frequent intra-peritoneal localization of metastatic ovarian cancer) might predominantly involve a CXCR1/CXCL8 axis, at least in vitro and in murine models46. These results highlight that the homing of tumour cells to surrounding adipose tissue would depend considerably on tumour- and host-dictated characteristics (thar is, the specific secretion pattern of adipose depots). Such a concept is supported by our results with other types of cancer demonstrating, at least in vitro, that their migration towards Ad-CM is rather dependent on the CXCR2 and CXCR4 receptors, with no involvement of the CCR3 receptor (Supplementary Fig. 5). The absence of CCR3 involvement in migration towards Ad-CM, despite its expression in other cellular models, is intriguing and is not explained at the present time. It is interesting to note that in contrast to prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. 7a), the other models have been previously reported secrete CCL7 (refs 29, 54). This autocrine secretion could lead to the absence of a CCL7 gradient between tumour cells and Ad-CM, therefore, hindering directed migration. In addition, it has been previously documented that CCR3 activity exhibits a marked sensitivity to relatively small changes in the extracellular environment (such as pH and ionic strength)55 that can potentially be achieved by tumour cell metabolism. This could also represent an interesting hypothesis since it has been proposed that prostate cancer cells might exhibit unique metabolic features with a higher dependence on lipid metabolism than aerobic glycolysis for growth and survival56.",
                "In conclusion, deciphering the pivotal chemokine/chemokine receptor axis for adipose tissue-induced chemotaxis in each tumour type would considerably help to set up specific therapeutic strategies especially in obese patients since increased local dissemination is also observed for other cancer types, breast cancer providing the most convincing evidence to date57. In human prostate cancer, we showed that the expression of the CCR3 receptor, which is upregulated in obese patients, is associated with aggressive prostate cancer with extended localization and a higher risk of both BCR and treatment failure. To our knowledge, the correlation between expression of a chemokine receptor and these different parameters of prostate cancer progression has never been reported within the same study. Our results highlight the clinical relevance of CCR3 expression in prostate cancer local dissemination. Indeed, first, CCR3 expression is correlated with Gleason score that reflects both the extent of glandular differentiation and the pattern of tumour growth in the prostatic stroma58. In fact, higher Gleason scores are characterized by isolated islets of cancer cells that are able to locally disseminate58. Second, prostate capsule penetration and local spread, which correspond with pT stage, are also strongly correlated with CCR3 expression. Third, our experiments also suggest that cells expressing higher levels of CCR3 are recruited to the invasive front and this effect is amplified in overweight and obese patients (Supplementary Fig. 13). Therefore, our results suggest new strategies for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer involving CCR3 antagonists, which are currently being developed for other diseases including asthma17."

The sum of tumour Gleason scores was recorded for each microarray. The second fully annotated TMA was engineered from prostatectomy pieces of 101 patients that underwent surgery between 1 February 2010 and 1 December 2011 in the Department of Urology of the University Hospital of Toulouse (directed by Professor P. Rischmann). The clinical and biochemical (PSA measurement) follow-up of the patients was updated in March 2015. Surgical treatment consisted of a robot-assisted, open-retropubic radical prostatectomy. Prostatectomy was associated in some cases with ilio-obturator bilateral lymphadenectomy (standard or extended). All patients included in the study had localized disease without metastasis (as assessed by clinical and radiological examinations) at the time of the surgery. All patients signed a consent form for the use of their tissue samples for scientific purposes before surgical intervention. The surgery specimen was treated within 15\u2009min of its removal to limit the delay between devascularization and freezing, thus ensuring the preservation of labile molecules. Tissue samples were placed in cryovials, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. Two pathologists (Dr Catherine Mazerolles and Dr Youri Socrier), who were blind to clinical data, independently selected the areas of interest used for the preparation of TMA. Selected tumour areas had a morphology and histological differentiation similar to the tumour Gleason score of the whole tumour or the worst Gleason score found in the tumour in the case of multifocal tumours. After selecting the sample block, 0.2\u2009mm diameter core samples were included according to a predetermined pattern in a recipient block. Gleason scores, pathological and clinical stage, surgical margins (a positive surgical margin was defined as cancer cells in contact with the inked specimen surface), follow-up time and BCR, as defined by the European Association of Urology guidelines by two PSA readings >0.2\u2009ng\u2009ml\u22121 (ref. 69), were available for all patients. Surgical treatment failure was defined by patients exhibiting either BCR, locoregional recurrence or distant metastases or by the use of adjuvant radiation or hormonal deprivation therapy, as previously defined38."

                        "Immunohistochemical experiments were performed to detect the expression of CCR3 in prostate cancer TMA. Immunostaining was performed with the EnVision FLEX Mini Kit, High pH (Dako Autostainer/Autostainer Plus; Dako France, Trappes, France). The TMA were immersed in xylene to remove paraffin and then rehydrated by successive baths of graded alcohol (100\u201370% and then distilled water), followed by treatment with the antigen unmasking solution for antigen retrieving (Citrate Target Retrieval Solution from Dako) in a water bath at 95\u2009\u00b0C. After saturation of endogenous peroxidases (Peroxidase blocking solution from Dako), the samples were incubated with the primary anti-CCR3 antibody (diluted to 1/100). TMAs were then incubated with FLEX/HRP conjugate secondary antibody (EnVision FLEX+ Mouse and Rabbit from Dako). The samples were rinsed, then treated with liquid DAB (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and washed with distilled water. Finally, the counter-staining was carried out with hematoxylin (Dako) and the various TMA were mounted with Eukitt reagent. Two pathologists, who were blind to clinical data, independently scored CCR3 expression in human tumours as negative, low, moderate (mid) or high (manual scoring). None of the tumours were negative for CCR3 expression. The slides were then digitally scanned via Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0RS and analysed with the device software provided by the manufacturer. The intensity of CCR3 staining has been quantified by computer through the use of ImageJ software, with tumour staining separated using deconvolution plug-in3536. As a first step, we used a color deconvolution technique to separate the pure DAB and hematoxylin stained areas leaving a complimentary image. The pixel intensities of separated DAB or hematoxylin images range from 0 to 255. Value 0 represents the lightest shade of the color while 255 represent the darkest shade of the color in the image. To assign an automated score by judging the pure DAB staining pattern, a histogram profile of every image, that is, the number of pixels of a specific intensity value versus their respective intensity was raised using ImageJ standard programme feature. Note that we excluded the pixel intensity values corresponding to the unspecific staining. Intensity for each tumour gland was quantified after manual selection of the area of interest under the supervision of pathologists. Finally, we verified that the results obtained were in accordance to the three groups defined by the manual scoring (median signal\u00b1s.e.m., low expression: 28.5\u00b14.1, moderate: 46.2\u00b12.0, high: 56.0\u00b13.1 arbitrary units)."

We then examined the clinical and biological characteristics of patients to identify patients with aggressive and extended tumours. For the correlation between CCR3 expression and quantitative data (for example, prostate weight) or variables with more than two ordered classes regarding disease severity (for example, Gleason score or tumour stage), we used a Spearman's rank correlation test assuming a monotonic relation between considered variables. We used the Student's t-test to correlate CCR3 expression to non-ordered variables represented by a category (for example, presence or absence of lymphatic emboli). Non-parametric tests are more conservative than parametric tests. In some cases, we also expected a lack of statistical power given the limited size of some sub-populations of variables. Leptin and CCL7 expression in hu-VAT were correlated using Pearson's correlation analysis."
