    "abstract": "Several agents capable of inducing vascular responses akin to those observed in inflammatory processes enhance the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors. Exemplary vascular-active agents include a bacterium, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and microtubule-destabilizing drugs. Such agents can increase the tumor to blood ratio of radioactivity by more than 20-fold compared to nanoparticles alone. Moreover, vascular-active agents dramatically improved the therapeutic effect of nanoparticles containing radioactive isotopes or chemotherapeutic agents.",

                        "Wounding results in increased vascular permeability, a process that is markedly enhanced if a wound becomes infected. In response to infection, the mammalian host mobilizes an army of immunoglobulins, complement, white blood cells, and cytokines. To allow this army to engage the enemy, the vascular system at the site of infection must open its gates. This process has been studied in detail and many of the biochemical mechanisms have been identified (1).",
                        "Interestingly, it has been said that tumors resemble \u201cunhealed wounds\u201d (2). Accordingly, it is known that the vasculature of tumors is different from that of normal cells, and much effort has gone into exploiting this difference through therapeutic agents like Avastin (3-5). A particularly important phenomenon related to this vascular distinction is referred to as Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) (6). EPR has been identified in many experimental tumor systems and is believed to result from the aberrant tumor vasculature combined with a lack of functional lymphatics in solid tumors. Because of its selectivity for large molecules, EPR has been exploited for therapeutic purposes by using macromolecular drugs or nanoparticles within an appropriate size range (7-10). One notable example is Doxil, a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin, which has been approved for the treatment of human cancers.",

The substance delivered to tumors may be a therapeutic agent or an imaging agent. The substance may include a carrier for the therapeutic or imaging agent or it may be the agent without a carrier. The use of the vascular-active permeability entity increases the amount of agent which is delivered to the solid tumor relative to the amount which was administered to the individual.

                        "A detectable imaging agent can be coupled, conjugated, entrapped, or encapsulated by/to an antibody or nanoparticle. The imaging agent may be a magnetic material, a photosensitizing agent, a contrast agent, or a radionuclide, for example. The radionuclide may be, for example, Iodine-131 (131I), Iodine-125 (125I), Fluorine-18 (18F), Gallium-68 (68Ga), Copper-64 (64Cu), Copper-67 (67Cu), Zirconium-89 (89Zr), Yttrium-90 (90Y), Lutetium-177 (177Lu), Indium-111 (111In), or Technetium-99m (99mTc).

Other imaging agents which may be used include Feridex I.V., mangafodipir (Teslascan), a contrast agent for ultrasound, such as a micro-bubble contrast agent, and fluorodeoxyglucose (18F). After the imaging agent is administered and a suitable time is elapsed for the agent to reach the target tumor, a non-invasive detection technique is performed to generate an image of the tumor in the individual. Suitable techniques include without limitation MRI, ultrasound, PET, and CT scan.",
                        "Vascular-active permeability agents are those which increase the amount of a therapeutic or imaging agent which is delivered via the circulation to a tumor. Without limiting the invention to any particular mechanism of action, the agents may act by causing vascular inflammation, or by disrupting the vasculature so that agents of a size which were previously not delivered are delivered, or so that an increase in the amount of an agent of a certain size is delivered. Exemplary vascular-active permeability agents include bacteria (including bacteria which spontaneously infect tumors), such as Clostridium novyi-NT, bacterial spores, a bacterial component, for example lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a vaccine, Coley's toxin, a cytokine, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), or interleukin-2 (IL-2), a chemokine, an inducer of cytokine or chemokine expression, e.g., vadimezan (ASA404, DMXAA), and inducer of vascular inflammation, an immune response modifier, a hormone, a pressor agent, such as angiotensin II or adrenaline, a virus, a microtubule interacting agent, such as vinorelbine, combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P), HTI-286, or colchicine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, such as L-NAME, L-NNA, or L-NMMA, tumor-localized radiation, and tumor-localized thermotherapy, and high intensity focused ultrasound.",
                        "Any combination of named therapeutic or imaging agents with vascular-active permeability entities are specifically contemplated as if each combination were listed separately and explicitly.",
                        "Any method known in the art can be used to determine whether the amount of therapeutic agent or imaging agent delivered is increased. These include, without limitation in vivo imaging, biopsy, and agent localization, or tumor response using RESIST criteria. The (1) vascular-active permeability agent and (2) nanoparticles or antibodies with (3) an imaging agent can be used to assess appropriateness of treatment or appropriate dosages of (a) the vascular-active permeability agents and (b) nanoparticles or antibodies with (c) a therapeutic agent. Thus these can be used sequentially or iteratively. Kits may contain the reagents for both assessment and therapeutic uses.",
                        "Solid tumors to be treated may be of any type and in any organ of the body of a mammal, such as a farm animal, a pet, a laboratory animal, or a human. These may be in the brain, colon, breasts, prostate, liver, kidneys, lungs, esophagus, head and neck, ovaries, cervix, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, uterus, testes, and pancreas, as non-limiting examples. The type of tumor may be an adenocarcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, or a sarcoma, for example.",
                        "The major limitation for most chemotherapeutic agents is their toxicity toward normal tissues, which prohibits the use of doses high enough to eradicate all cancer cells. One approach to address this problem is to develop agents that are delivered to all cells but are preferentially toxic to tumor cells because of the abnormal signaling pathways. This strategy underlies the success of agents such as Gleevec (imatinib) and Iressa (gefitinib) (26, 27). A second approach is to use agents that bind to extracellular molecules present at higher concentrations on the surface of tumor cells, such as Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Erbitux (cetuximab) (28, 29). The third approach takes advantage of the abnormal vasculature present in tumors, allowing preferential accumulation of nanoparticles (the EPR effect) (6, 30). Though all approaches have merit, the third has the advantage that virtually any drug, including a wealth of clinically approved agents, can in theory be made more effective by its incorporation into nanoparticles of appropriate sizes. The ability to use agents that are already clinically approved poses many practical advantages with respect to the performance of clinical trials and the duration of the drug approval process.",
                        "In this work, we have attempted to enhance the third approach through pharmacologic manipulation of the abnormal vasculature already present in tumors. We show that Enhanced EPR (E2PR). can dramatically increase the tumor: blood ratio of nanoparticles, as assessed by both imaging and therapeutic response. It is worth noting that even a small difference in the intratumoral concentration of an agent can make a large difference in therapeutic effect (31). In the studies described here, E2PR led to a tumor: blood ratio of more than 22-fold (FIG. 2A).",
                        "We were particularly encouraged with the results in the GBM model. This tumor type in humans is highly recalcitrant to conventional therapies, leading to a dismal prognosis for patients with this disease. The blood-brain barrier is at least partly to blame for the limited efficacy of chemotherapy (32). We found that TNF-\u03b1 treatment could help breach the blood-brain barrier and result in major accumulations of 125I-labeled sterically stabilized liposomal nanoparticles (SSLs) in the orthotopically implanted brain tumors as well as significantly prolong the survival of the tumor-bearing animals (FIG. 4). As the mouse cranial cavity is small, murine brain tumors are particularly difficult to treat as even a minimal amount of growth of a pre-existing tumor is lethal.",
                        "Our results suggest a way to improve the therapeutic efficacy of conventional and novel drugs by incorporating them into nanoparticles and injecting them together with vascular-active agents such as TNF-\u03b1. The approach is versatile, as it should be practicable with a variety of nanoparticle formulations as well as with diverse chemical and radioactive agents.",

This infection often leads to eradication of the internal hypoxic regions of tumors but leaves the oxygenated rim of the tumors intact. C. novyi-NT secretes an enzyme called liposomase at high levels in the infected tumors (12, 14). We hypothesized that a radiolabeled anti-liposomase antibody would synergize with C. novyi-NT by binding to liposomase secreted by the bacteria, thereby eradicating the oxygenated tumor rim through \u03b2-particle irradiation. A monoclonal antibody against liposomase was generated and used to evaluate this hypothesis (see Methods).",

The anti-liposomase antibody was highly enriched in the tumors infected with C. novyi-NT but not in uninfected tumors (FIG. 1A). Surprisingly, however, the radiolabeled IgG control antibody was also enriched in the C. novyi-NT infected tumors, albeit to a lesser extent (FIG. 1A). Biodistribution analyses showed that the level of radioactivity in the tumor was four-fold higher than that in most normal tissues (FIG. 1B).",

The partially humanized version of this antibody, Rituximab, has been marketed for the treatment of B cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (15, 16).

                                "We reasoned that the inflammatory response to the bacterial infection led to an increased vascular permeability, resulting in the preferential antibody accumulation at the infected tumor site. We therefore sought to identify a pro-cytokine that might mimic the effects of C. novyi-NT. Among those considered, Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was of particular interest as this cytokine has been identified as the serum factor responsible for endotoxin-induced vascular permeabilization (17, 18). Furthermore, a similar hemorrhagic necrosis in tumors is observed following systemic administration of either TNF-\u03b1 or C. novyi-NT spores (11, 17). Based on these parallels, we repeated the protocol described above, substituting systemically-administered TNF-\u03b1 for C. novyi-NT spores. When CT26 tumor-bearing mice were injected with murine TNF-\u03b1 and radiolabeled murine IgG, significant IgG accumulation was observed in the tumors but not in the normal tissues (FIGS. 1B and C). A time course study revealed that the IgG tumor accumulation progressed slowly and peaked between 72 and 96 hours after injection (FIG. 1C).",
                                "The effect of vascular-active agents on tumor vasculature will henceforth be referred to as Enhanced EPR (E2PR). Sterically stabilized liposomal nanoparticles (SSLs) of \u02dc100 nm in diameter have been shown to be susceptible to the EPR effect (8). To evaluate whether such liposomes were susceptible to E2PR, we fabricated radioactive liposomes using a Bolton-Hunter (BH) reagent-based iodination strategy (13). Iodinated BH reagent labels proteins by forming amide bonds with free amino groups such as those present on arginine (19). SSLs were loaded with arginine at low pH and then the loaded SSLs were incubated with 125I-labeled BH reagent. The 125I\u2014BH reagent passed through the lipid bilayer but was unable to exit after covalent binding to the arginine because of the latter's positive charge. We were thus able to achieve a very high concentration of radioactivity within the SSLs while avoiding prolonged exposure to the radioactivity during the preparation.",
                                "125I-labeled SSLs were intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice in combination with either C. novyi-NT or TNF-\u03b1. Both C. novyi-NT and TNF-\u03b1 treatments significantly augmented the selective retention of 125I within tumors (FIG. 2). Furthermore, the radioactivity in normal tissues was markedly lower compared to the animals treated with 125I-labeled SSLs without TNF-\u03b1 or C. novyi-NT (FIG. 2A).",
                                "Thus, the tumor-to-blood radio of radioactivity following TNF-\u03b1 treatment was as high as 22-fold, far higher than achieved with radiolabeled IgG (compare FIG. 2A to FIG. 1B). SPECT/CT also revealed that the kinetics of tumor accumulation was different with radiolabeled SSLs than with IgG: SSL accumulation peaked at 24 hours, 48-72 hours earlier than IgG.",
                                "Like EPR, the effect of E2PR is particle size-dependent. In contrast to 125I-labeled SSLs, tumor retention of 125I-labeled arginine (the substrate of 125I labeling in SSLs) is not affected by TNF-\u03b1. However, at the other end of the size spectrum, 125I-labeled C. novyi-NT spores (\u02dc1 \u03bcm in diameter (20)) are highly enriched in tumors only when combined with TNF-\u03b1 (data not shown). Thus, E2PR appears to reflect a more substantial vascular disruption than EPR: while EPR favors accumulation of nanoparticles in the range around 100 nm (8), E2PR extends that range to >1 \u03bcm.",
                                "To determine whether the accumulation was dependent on the volume of the tumor, we injected TNF-\u03b1 plus 125I-labeled IgG or 125I-labeled SSLs into animals with a small subcutaneous tumor on one flank and a large tumor on the other flank. SPECT/CT showed retention of radioactivity in both tumors. We also tested the relative timing of injection of TNF-\u03b1 and 125I-labeled SSLs. Though TNF-\u03b1 and SSLs were administered jointly in the experiments recorded above, we found that similar results were obtained when TNF-\u03b1 was administered within 12 hours after SSLs. Conversely, E2PR was not observed when TNF-\u03b1 was administered 6 hours prior to SSL administration (data not shown).",
                                "Microtubule-interacting agents are also able to disrupt the tumor vasculature (21). We therefore determined whether such agents could induce E2PR. Combretastatin A4P(CA4P) and vinorelbine are microtubule-interacting agents with completely different structures and modes of interaction with microtubules (22, 23). Injection of either resulted in E2PR, though not as impressively as TNF-\u03b1."

Mice bearing fully developed CT26 tumors were treated by simultaneous i.v. injections of TNF-\u03b1 plus Doxil (10 mg/kg) or radiolabeled IgG. 131I rather than 125I was chosen for radiolabeling in light of the type of ionizing radiation required for a radiotherapeutic effect. Although treatment with Doxil or 131I-labeled IgG in the absence of TNF-\u03b1 retarded tumor growth and prolonged animal survival, the tumors always grew back (FIGS. 3A and B). When combined with TNF-\u03b1, however, a single administration of these agents led to complete tumor regression in all animals and long-term cures in more than 75% of them. When a lower dose (25 ng/kg) of TNF-\u03b1 was used, none of the treated animals were cured, although prolonged survival was observed. It is important to note that humans tolerate multiple injections (3 infusions/week) of a dose comparable to the highest dose of TNF-\u03b1 we used (24). We also tested SSLs containing 131I, generated using the chemical trapping approach described above. While 131I-labeled SSLs alone retarded tumor growth, complete tumor regression and cures were only observed when they were used in combination with TNF-\u03b1 (FIG. 3C).",

When implanted orthotopically, the brain tumor cell line GL261 forms very aggressive tumors, killing animals within about a month (FIG. 4A). At the histologic level, these tumors are very similar to human GBM, manifesting an infiltrative growth pattern, necrosis and neovascularization (25). Following stereotactic injection of GL261 cells into the frontal lobe, brain tumors were allowed to grow to substantial size, then 125I-labeled SSLs with or without TNF-\u03b1 were administered. Tumor accumulation of the radiolabeled SSLs was only observed in TNF-\u03b1 treated animals (FIG. 4B). Mice with similar tumors were injected with Doxil, either with or without TNF-\u03b1. The combination clearly had a therapeutic benefit, prolonging survival up to 103 days even in this highly challenging pre-clinical model (FIG. 4A). Both Doxil and TNF-\u03b1 showed limited therapeutic benefit when used as single agents, with no animal surviving beyond 50 days following tumor implantation."
