                                "Over the past decade, the emerging field of soft robotics has shown increasing potential to dramatically expand the capabilities of the field of robotics. Currently, however, most demonstrations have been limited to precisely that, potential. For soft robotics to emerge as a truly useful technology and become widely used in real-world application, advances are required in actuation, controls, fabrication and system design, and integration with larger rigid systems. Also critically important is development of novel sensor technologies, able to quickly provide robust state information, both as individual sensors and as integrated sensing systems. Soft robots hold the potential for unprecedented levels of state awareness and perception of the surrounding environment impossible with traditional rigid-linked robots. This innate ability to yield to the environment and to sense and learn from that interaction is one of the biggest potential advantages of soft robots. By embracing this ability to interact, soft robots hold the potential to fundamentally change human-robot-interaction, and usher in the era of Robots Among Us that has been promised for decades. To achieve this leap forward in state awareness and embodied intelligence, a rethinking of soft sensing is necessary.",
                                "Many technologies have been presented to achieve myriad sensing modes in soft robots. Soft sensors (sensors composed of compliant materials, gels, liquids, or a combination of these housed inside a soft robotics component) have been developed using conductive grease [1], capacitive liquid [2], resistive ionic gels [3], waveguides [4], and many demonstrations with liquid metals [5-7], primarily focusing on a Eutectic of Gallium and Indium (EGaIn) [8]. These many sensor technologies can measure changes in length [9], bending [10], pressure [11], even temperature in the distal end of a soft finger [12], and several mixed-mode sensing models [2], including an extremely compelling sensor from Park et al. [13], able to sense two modes of stretch and pressure, all in one sensor. Other sensing techniques used in soft robotics have involved adhering traditional bend sensors to a soft actuator[14], embedded magnets and hall effect sensors[15], and optical methods including the SOFTcell project by Bajcsy and Fearing [16] in which tactile response was determined through optical analysis of a deformed membrane, and video tracking of markers adhered to or embedded in soft components[17].",
                                "While these studies present compelling sensors, further sensor development is necessary particularly in utilizing a suite of sensors to increase overall state awareness. In both traditional and soft robotics many have studied proprioceptive sensor systems, robot skin, and bioinspired sensing/proprioception. Thorough discussion of these broad fields can be found in several reviews of various subspecialties [18-22]. The value of multi-sensor systems to perceive different proprioceptive or exteroceptive phenomena is widely appreciated. However, as the number of sensors increases, the computation, data acquisition, and signal processing loads dramatically increase. Each sensor requires a dedicated channel to a data acquisition system or an analog to digital converter, and requires signal processing and computation. A sensor-skin with a grid of ten-by-ten sensors would be of relatively modest requirement for many applications. Using discrete nodes, this would require one hundred dedicated sensors. Multiplexing by separating signals into ten horizontal and ten vertical sensors reduces the load to twenty separate sensors, still a considerable burden for a single sensor-skin device. What is needed, then, are improved methods for tracking motion and sensing of soft robotic systems. The present disclosure satisfies this need."

Each displacement sensor is composed of two main parts: fiber and tube. The fiber is a flexible but inextensible/incompressible nylon fiber. The tube is a flexible elastomeric void built into the bulk matrix of the finger. Fibers are fixed at the distal end of the finger and routed through tubes along the length of the finger and out to a display assembly (FIG. 1B). A short length (marker) of each fiber inside the display assembly is painted black. This contrasts with the white background allowing a digital camera to record the relative motion of the marker. When the elastomeric finger is distorted (bent, twisted, stretched), each tube changes shape and is stretched or compressed based on the overall mechanics of the mode of distortion.

In contrast to a Bowden cable assembly, which transmits force in many bicycle handbrakes, the passive sensor of the first example is distorted based on external actuation and used to sense displacement (the reverse of Bowden cables). Multiple cable-based sensors are embedded along the dorsal, ventral, and medial surfaces of the soft robotic sensor (3\u00d73 grid at the end of the finger in FIG. 1A, 1B). Comparing relative motion between this grid of sensors allows differentiation between bending, stretching, and twist.",

                                "The performance of the elastomeric finger containing fiber-based displacement sensors and fluid-based pressure sensor was evaluated in each actuation mode individually, although many applications may require mixed-mode sensing (elongation and twist combined, or bending along a non-primary axis) using the real-time vision algorithms described above. For the fiber-based sensor, separate characterization fixtures were employed for each mode of evaluation (bending, elongation, twist). As shown in FIG. 4A, each fiber sensor was mounted to an Instron 5943 tensile tester (Instron Co. Norwood, Mass.). The same apparatus was used for bending 1 and bending 2, offset by 90\u00b0 as illustrated in FIG. 4A-4E. Integrated microfluidic pressure sensor characterization (FIG. 4F) and surface mount microfluidic pressure sensor characterization (FIG. 4G) were performed on the same fixture, and chromatophore-inspired sensor characterization (FIG. 4H, I) was performed on a separate fixture. Each test was performed four times to monitor repeatability.",

                                "Data was divided into fiber-based deformation sensors, (estimating soft finger displacement) and fluid-based pressure sensors (microfluidic and color cells). Fiber-based sensor characterization investigates displacement of a 3\u00d73 grid of fibers as described in the Methods section. FIG. 5 presents fiber responses to displacement in two modes of bending (offset by 90\u00b0), extension, and twist. Finger orientation and resulting fiber locations within the finger are shown in the illustration to the left of each graph. To achieve two modes of bending, the finger was rotated inside the mounting fixture 90\u00b0 between Bending 1 and Bending 2, yielding a different fiber orientation. Fiber orientation for elongation and twist is also shown, but because these displacements are along the longitudinal axis, orientation does not affect results.",
                                "(i) Fiber-Based Deformation Sensor",
                                "As the elastomeric finger undergoes displacement in the described mode, material distorts locally, consistent with theory from classical mechanics of materials ([23]). Fibers, attached at the distal end of the elastomeric finger are free to move inside their respective tubes, thus they do not elongate or compress. Rather they move along their tube and back through the display assembly. Thus, when the finger undergoes Bending direction 1 (FIG. 5A), the top portion of the finger undergoes compression, the bottom undergoes tension, and the midplane sees little tension or compression. With the fiber configuration shown in FIG. 5A, bending 1 should cause the uppermost fibers to move farther into the display assembly (positive direction). The lower fibers should move out of the display assembly (negative direction) and fibers in the midplane should move very little at all, as verified by the data in the graph in FIG. 5A. Solid lines (fiber 1, 4, 8) are positive, dotted lines (fibers 2, 6, 9) are negative, and dashed lines (fiber 3, 5, 7) moved little at all. Due to the test setup (distal end of finger pulled upward and allowed to move laterally) some tension in the finger caused the midplane to stretch slightly, causing slight negative values in dashed lines.",
                                "When the finger was rotated 90\u00b0 and Bending direction 2 was investigated (FIG. 5B), similar results were observed. In this configuration, black lines (fibers 7, 8, 9) were those along the top edge of the finger, where the finger was in compression. These fibers moved into the display assembly (positive displacement). Similarly, red lines (fibers 1, 2, 3) were pulled out of the assembly, but green lines (fibers 4, 5, 6) were little affected.",
                                "Tests in elongation (FIG. 5C) were also as expected. As the elastomeric finger was elongated, all fibers moved out of the display assembly, and recorded as negative displacement. Experiments in twist (FIG. 5D) also showed results consistent with classical mechanics of materials. Fibers at the corners, farthest radially from the central axis (fibers 1, 2, 8, 9) exhibited the most deformation, pulling the fibers out of the display assembly for negative displacement. Fibers along the flat of each surface (fibers 3, 4, 6, 7), closer to the neutral axis, exhibited less deformation, and recorded as less-negative displacement. Finally, fiber 5 at the neutral axis exhibited almost no displacement at all.",
                                "(ii) Hysteresis",
                                "The hysteresis loop (wherein the actuation path does not overlay with release path, but instead creates a loop in bend angle, elongation, or twist vs fiber displacement) was also studied. If the hysteresis were due to the internal properties of the fiber sensors, it would not negate the value of the sensing system, but it should be addressed. Analysis of the still frames from the motion capture videos indicated that the actuation and release paths of the elastomeric finger do not trace out a similar path. In other words, the shape of the elastomeric finger is different at a given angle in the actuation (0\u00b0\u219290\u00b0) path than in the release (90\u00b0\u21920\u00b0) path. Thus, it would be expected that the fibers sense different finger geometry based on the path.",
                                "(iii) Microfluidic Pressure Sensors",
                                "The elastomeric finger was configured with an integrated microfluidic pressure sensor along its entire length. Consisting of a liquid-filled microfluidic channel, this sensor was intended to sense the overall pressure state in the elastomeric finger. Thus, repeatability and range are highly desirable; however maximizing sensitivity (ability to perceive a light touch) was not required for this sensor. FIG. 6A shows a very repeatable and linear response to forces up to eight Newton, with no sign of signal saturation (change in geometry precludes perception of increased applied load) over four trials. FIG. 6B shows the sensor response of a surface-mounted pressure sensor over four trials. Such a sensor would be attached to the surface of the elastomeric finger to sense a desired (or undesired) contact at a particular location on the finger surface. Thus, for such a sensor, linearity and maximum force before saturation are not primary concerns. Rather, for this sensor, the ability to detect contact is of primary interest. While this sensor is shown to saturate with an applied force below four Newton, saturation is of little concern once contact is detected.",
                                "FIG. 6C presents the behavior of the chromatophore-inspired fluidic pressure sensor. At applied loads, up to eight Newton, the radial expansion of the liquid cell is relatively repeatable and very linear. The technique has been demonstrated here using one liquid cell, but the technique could be expanded to any number of cells at varying depths, colors, and volumes to achieve a multitude of responses to pressure."

                                "An example elastomeric finger described herein comprises nine fiber sensors to determine its pose, and two fluidic sensors to determine overall and local pressure states. By configuring fibers in a 3\u00d73 matrix, classical Mechanics of Materials (See [23]) was used to determine pose during states of bending in both primary planes, twist about the primary axis, and elongation along the primary axis. While this example illustrated using a finger designed specifically to illustrate adherence to classical mechanics of materials theory, this state estimation could be applied to a range of soft actuators and soft robots in general. The technique can also be implemented in actuator design similar to the soft finger described in [15,39] with a roughly square cross-section. These fiber and fluidic sensors could be used in many soft robots with actuators having rectangular, round, or trapezoidal cross-sections, requiring sensors to be placed at based on beam theory for that cross-section. With their innate under-actuation and deformability, defining the pose of a soft robot with reasonable accuracy requires far more sensors than do traditional robots. One can readily imagine a soft robot requiring nine sensors (3\u00d73 matrix) for each actuator to estimate its pose. Thus, using a convention technology, a three-fingered gripper would require 27 sensors, a simple quadruped would require 36, and a more complex robot would require many more. The circuitry and wiring required for this many discrete electrical sensors would quickly become burdensome. With the method and system according to embodiments presented herein, passive sensors are all routed back to one central display assembly and recorded by one digital camera. While the examples shows the number of sensors (11 sensors) in the display assembly was chosen as it was the number required to characterize the soft finger (nine deformation and two pressure sensors), other sensor numbers can be used. Any upgrading (to increase sampling frequency or resolution) could be contained to the camera system, while upgrading dozens of electrical sensors (as in conventional systems) would also be a comparatively sizeable task. As illustrated herein, many fibers could be routed back to one remote display assembly, where a single digital camera can track the motion of all markers in a controlled environment, optimally lit for contrast and marker tracking.",

These needs are becoming amplified with the growth of the Co-Bot movement, in which robots are placed among humans in the workplace and daily life. Our techniques provide solutions for robust, low cost sensing using widely available digital cameras. Our method uses displacement of components (fibers inside channels, liquid inside tubes, and deformation of liquid cell) captured by digital camera to sense phenomena in the environment.",
                                "More specifically, the present disclosure describes an elastomeric finger with nine embedded fiber deformation sensors, one integrated pressure sensor, and one surface-mounted pressure sensor. The fiber sensors have been experimentally characterized in two orthogonal directions of bending, twist about the finger's primary axis, and extension. All modes of deformation followed the responses expected from by mechanics of materials and beam theory. The integrated microfluidic pressure sensor demonstrated a highly repeatable response to externally applied pressure with no saturation detected at 7N externally applied force. The surface-mounted pressure sensor (to sense contact locally) sensed much smaller applied forces (0.05-0.3N) but saturated when as little as 2N force was applied. As a contact sensor, early detection is more useful than high saturation levels. These results on a single elastomeric finger provide a foundation upon which a wide variety of sensorized actuators utilizing the present invention can be built (including actuators described in [39].",
                                "While the sensor designs presented here have value individually, a key advantage is that the sensors are fundamentally designed to be used in groups. Intended to be designed into a soft robot at the system level, a properly configured array of these deformation and pressure sensors can give state awareness far beyond that of individual sensors. Most sensors used in soft robots (and many sensors in general) vary in resistance or capacitance in response to a change in a physical parameter such as length, bend angle, or contact pressure. Each sensor requires wiring, electronic circuitry, and a dedicated input to a data acquisition system before the resulting signal is sent to a computer. Five sensors require five times the infrastructure. Embodiments described herein, on the other hand, use a digital camera to record the movement of markers on fiber sensors and colored liquid in microfluidic channels. Thus dozens of markers and fluid channels can be monitored almost as easily as one. Other camera-based soft robot state-estimation systems exist, but they primarily record the pose of the robot directly, thus requiring specific lighting conditions, unobstructed line-of-sight access to all parts of the robot.",
                                "Recording the sensor states rather than the elastomeric finger itself (as illustrated herein) presents several advantages:\n\n\n- - No clear line of sight is needed. During typical robotic tasks,\n    portions of a finger would often become obstructed when\n    environmental objects or the robot itself come between the finger\n    and the camera.\n  - By remotely recording the display assembly, all aspects of recording\n    (color, contrast, lighting) can be controlled to values optimum for\n    marker tracking, impossible in real-world robotic applications.\n  - By tracking only monochromatic markers moving in well-defined\n    horizontal or vertical paths in a controlled environment (no\n    unanticipated glare/obstructions), extremely simplified vision\n    algorithms can be used, allowing much faster processing."
