# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In 2016, there will be an estimated 1,685,210 new cancer cases diagnosed and 595,690 cancer deaths in the US (Cancer Facts & Figures 2016, American Cancer Society 2016). Cancer vaccines based on human tumor-associated antigens (TAA) have been tested in patients with advanced or recurrent cancer, in combination with or following standard therapy. The immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of cancer vaccines has been difficult to properly evaluate due to the multiple highly suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment and the actions of standard therapy on the patient's immune system. In animal models of human cancer, vaccines administered in the prophylactic setting are most immunogenic and effectively prevent cancer development and progression.

Vaccines based on human TAAs are immunogenic and safe and capable of eliciting long-term memory that is important for cancer prevention.

One particular TAA is MUC-1 which is a member of the mucin family and encodes a membrane bound, glycosylated phosphoprotein. MUC1 has a core protein mass of 120-225 kDa which increases to 250-500 kDa with glycosylation. It extends 200-500 nm beyond the surface of the cell (Brayman M, Thathiah A, Carson D D, 2004, Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2: 4). The protein is anchored to the apical surface of many epithelia by a transmembrane domain. These repeats are rich in serine, threonine and proline residues which permits heavy o-glycosylation (Brayman M, Thathiah A, Carson D D, 2004, Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2: 4). Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms of this gene have been reported.

The cytoplasmic tail of MUC-1 is 72 amino acids long and contains several phosphorylation sites (Singh P K, Hollingsworth M A (August 2006), Trends Cell Biol. 16 (9): 467-476). The protein serves a protective function by binding to pathogens and also functions in a cell signaling capacity (Linden S K et al. 2009, PLoS Pathog. 5 (10): e1000617).

Overexpression, aberrant intracellular localization, and changes in glycosylation of this protein have been associated with carcinomas. Specifically, MUC-1 overexpression is often associated with colon, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers (Gendler S J (July 2001), J. Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia. 6 (3): 339-353).

Currently there is no US approved vaccine for humans against cancer. What is needed are immunogenic vaccine compositions and methods of use to prevent and treat cancer caused by neoplasms.

The term “immune response” refers to any response to an antigen or antigenic determinant by the immune system of a subject (e.g., a human). Exemplary immune responses include humoral immune responses (e.g., production of antigen-specific antibodies) and cell-mediated immune responses (e.g., production of antigen-specific T cells). Assays for assessing an immune response are known in the art and may comprise in vivo assays, such as assays to measure antibody responses and delayed type hypersensitivity responses. In an embodiment, the assay to measure antibody responses primarily may measure B-cell function as well as B-cell/T-cell interactions. For the antibody response assay, antibody titers in the blood may be compared following an antigenic challenge. As used herein, “antibody titers” can be defined as the highest dilution in post-immune sera that resulted in a value greater than that of pre-immune samples for each subject. The in vitro assays may comprise determining the ability of cells to divide, or to provide help for other cells to divide, or to release lymphokines and other factors, express markers of activation, and lyse target cells. Lymphocytes in mice and man can be compared in in vitro assays. In an embodiment, the lymphocytes from similar sources such as peripheral blood cells, splenocytes, or lymph node cells, are compared. It is possible, however, to compare lymphocytes from different sources as in the non-limiting example of peripheral blood cells in humans and splenocytes in mice. For the in vitro assay, cells may be purified (e.g., B-cells, T-cells, and macrophages) or left in their natural state (e.g., splenocytes or lymph node cells). Purification may be by any method that gives the desired results. The cells can be tested in vitro for their ability to proliferate using mitogens or specific antigens. The ability of cells to divide in the presence of specific antigens can be determined using a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay. Supernatant from the cultured cells can be tested to quantitate the ability of the cells to secrete specific lymphokines. The cells can be removed from culture and tested for their ability to express activation antigens. This can be done by any method that is suitable as in the non-limiting example of using antibodies or ligands which bind to the activation antigen as well as probes that bind the RNA coding for the activation antigen.

The term “neoplasm” as used herein means a new or abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body especially as a characteristic of cancer.

The term “neutralizing antibody” or “NAb” refers to an antibody which either is purified from, or is present in, a body fluid (e.g., serum or a mucosal secretion) and which recognizes a specific antigen and inhibits the effect(s) of the antigen in the subject (e.g., a human). As used herein, the antibody can be a single antibody or a plurality of antibodies.

The term “non-neutralizing antibody” or “nnAb” refers to a binding antibody that is not a neutralizing antibody.

“Operably linked.” A first nucleic acid sequence is operably linked with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter affects the transcription or expression of the coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein coding regions, in the same reading frame.

The term “prevent”, “preventing” and “prevention” refers to the inhibition of the development or onset of a condition (e.g., a tumor or a condition associated therewith), or the prevention of the recurrence, onset, or development of one or more symptoms of a condition in a subject resulting from the administration of a therapy or the administration of a combination of therapies.

Not all of these control sequences need always be present so long as the selected gene is capable of being transcribed and translated.

The term “shuttle vector” refers to a genetic vector (e.g., a DNA plasmid) that is useful for transferring genetic material from one host system into another. A shuttle vector can replicate alone (without the presence of any other vector) in at least one host (e.g., E. coli). In the context of MVA vector construction, shuttle vectors are usually DNA plasmids that can be manipulated in E. coli and then introduced into cultured cells infected with MVA vectors, resulting in the generation of new recombinant MVA vectors.

### II. Tumor Associated Antigens

The compositions of the present invention are useful for inducing an immune response to a Tumor associated antigen.

In a particular embodiment, the vectors express MUC-1. In one embodiment, the vectors express a hypoglycosylated form of MUC-1. MUC1 is found on nearly all epithelial cells, but it is over expressed in cancer cells, and its associated glycans are shorter than those of non-tumor-associated MUC1 (Gaidzik N et al. 2013, Chem Soc Rev. 42 (10): 4421-42).

The transmembrane glycoprotein Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly glycosylated and overexpressed in a variety of epithelial cancers, and plays a crucial role in progression of the disease. Tumor-associated MUC1 differs from the MUC1 expressed in normal cells with regard to its biochemical features, cellular distribution, and function. In cancer cells, MUC1 participates in intracellular signal transduction pathways and regulates the expression of its target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (Nath, S., Trends in Mol Med., Volume 20, Issue 6, p 332-342, June 2014).

### III. Recombinant Viral Vectors

In one aspect, the present invention is a recombinant viral vector comprising one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding tumor associated antigens or immunogenic fragments thereof. In certain embodiments, the recombinant viral vector is a vaccinia viral vector, and more particularly, an MVA vector, comprising one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding tumor associated antigens or immunogenic fragments thereof.

Vaccinia viruses have also been used to engineer viral vectors for recombinant gene expression and for the potential use as recombinant live vaccines (Mackett, M. et al 1982 PNAS USA 79:7415-7419; Smith, G. L. et al. 1984 Biotech Genet Engin Rev 2:383-407). This entails DNA sequences (genes) which code for foreign antigens being introduced, with the aid of DNA recombination techniques, into the genome of the vaccinia viruses. If the gene is integrated at a site in the viral DNA which is non-essential for the life cycle of the virus, it is possible for the newly produced recombinant vaccinia virus to be infectious, that is to say able to infect foreign cells and thus to express the integrated DNA sequence (EP Patent Applications No. 83,286 and No. 110,385). The recombinant vaccinia viruses prepared in this way can be used, on the one hand, as live vaccines for the prophylaxis of infectious diseases, on the other hand, for the preparation of heterologous proteins in eukaryotic cells.

Several such strains of vaccinia virus have been developed to avoid undesired side effects of smallpox vaccination. Thus, a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) has been generated by long-term serial passages of the Ankara strain of vaccinia virus (CVA) on chicken embryo fibroblasts (for review see Mayr, A. et al. 1975 Infection 3:6-14; Swiss Patent No. 568,392). The MVA virus is publicly available from American Type Culture Collection as ATCC No.: VR-1508. MVA is distinguished by its great attenuation, as demonstrated by diminished virulence and reduced ability to replicate in primate cells, while maintaining good immunogenicity. The MVA virus has been analyzed to determine alterations in the genome relative to the parental CVA strain. Six major deletions of genomic DNA (deletion I, II, III, IV, V, and VI) totaling 31,000 base pairs have been identified (Meyer, H. et al. 1991 J Gen Virol 72:1031-1038). The resulting MVA virus became severely host cell restricted to avian cells.

Furthermore, MVA is characterized by its extreme attenuation. When tested in a variety of animal models, MVA was proven to be avirulent even in immunosuppressed animals. More importantly, the excellent properties of the MVA strain have been demonstrated in extensive clinical trials (Mayr A. et al. 1978 Zentralbl Bakteriol [B] 167:375-390; Stickl et al. 1974 Dtsch Med Wschr 99:2386-2392). During these studies in over 120,000 humans, including high-risk patients, no side effects were associated with the use of MVA vaccine.

MVA replication in human cells was found to be blocked late in infection preventing the assembly to mature infectious virions. Nevertheless, MVA was able to express viral and recombinant genes at high levels even in non-permissive cells and was proposed to serve as an efficient and exceptionally safe gene expression vector (Sutter, G. and Moss, B. 1992 PNAS USA 89:10847-10851). Additionally, novel vaccinia vector vaccines were established on the basis of MVA having foreign DNA sequences inserted at the site of deletion III within the MVA genome (Sutter, G. et al. 1994 Vaccine 12:1032-1040).

Recombinant MVA vaccinia viruses can be prepared as set out hereinafter. A DNA-construct which contains a DNA-sequence which codes for a foreign polypeptide flanked by MVA DNA sequences adjacent to a predetermined insertion site (e.g. between two conserved essential MVA genes such as I8R/G1L; in restructured and modified deletion III; or at other non-essential sites within the MVA genome) is introduced into cells infected with MVA, to allow homologous recombination. Once the DNA-construct has been introduced into the eukaryotic cell and the foreign DNA has recombined with the viral DNA, it is possible to isolate the desired recombinant vaccinia virus in a manner known per se, preferably with the aid of a marker. The DNA-construct to be inserted can be linear or circular. A plasmid or polymerase chain reaction product is preferred. Such methods of making recombinant MVA vectors are described in PCT publication WO/2006/026667 incorporated by reference herein. The DNA-construct contains sequences flanking the left and the right side of a naturally occurring deletion. The foreign DNA sequence is inserted between the sequences flanking the naturally occurring deletion. For the expression of a DNA sequence or gene, it is necessary for regulatory sequences, which are required for the transcription of the gene, to be present on the DNA. Such regulatory sequences (called promoters) are known to those skilled in the art, and include for example those of the vaccinia 11 kDa gene as are described in EP-A-198,328, and those of the 7.5 kDa gene (EP-A-110,385). The DNA-construct can be introduced into the MVA infected cells by transfection, for example by means of calcium phosphate precipitation (Graham et al. 1973 Virol 52:456-467; Wigler et al. 1979 Cell 16:777-785), by means of electroporation (Neumann et al. 1982 EMBO J. 1:841-845), by microinjection (Graessmann et al. 1983 Meth Enzymol 101:482-492), by means of liposomes (Straubinger et al. 1983 Meth Enzymol 101:512-527), by means of spheroplasts (Schaffher 1980 PNAS USA 77:2163-2167) or by other methods known to those skilled in the art.

The MVA vectors described and tested herein were unexpectedly found to be effective after a single prime or a homologous prime/boost regimen. Other MVA vector designs require a heterologous prime/boost regimen while still other published studies have been unable to induce effective immune responses with MVA vectors. Conversely, the present MVA vector design and methods of manufacture are useful in producing effective MVA vaccine vectors for eliciting effective T-cell and antibody immune responses. Furthermore, the utility of an MVA vaccine vector capable of eliciting effective immune responses and antibody production after a single homologous prime boost is significant for considerations such as use, commercialization and transport of materials especially to affected third world locations.

In one embodiment, the present invention is a recombinant viral vector (e.g., an MVA vector) comprising one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding tumor associated antigens or immunogenic fragments thereof. The viral vector (e.g., an MVA vector) may be constructed using conventional techniques known to one of skill in the art. The one or more heterologous gene inserts encode a polypeptide having desired immunogenicity, i.e., a polypeptide that can induce an immune reaction, cellular immunity and/or humoral immunity, in vivo by administration thereof. The gene region of the viral vector (e.g., an MVA vector) where the gene encoding a polypeptide having immunogenicity is introduced is flanked by regions that are indispensable. In the introduction of a gene encoding a polypeptide having immunogenicity, an appropriate promoter may be operatively linked upstream of the gene encoding a polypeptide having desired immunogenicity.

The one or more nucleic acid sequences encoding tumor associated antigens or immunogenic fragments thereof may be selected from any TAAs. In one embodiment, the one more TAA or immunogenic fragments thereof are selected from the group consisting of MUC1, an extracellular fragment of MUC1, an intracellular fragment of MUC1, Oncofetal Antigen/immature Laminin Receptor Protein (OFA/iLRP), an extracellular fragment of OFA/iLRP, an intracellular fragment of OFA/iLRP, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), an extracellular fragment of CEA, an intracellular fragment of CEA, or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment, the deletion III site is restructured and modified to remove non-essential flanking sequences.

In exemplary embodiments, the vaccine is constructed to express a TAA for example MUC1, which is inserted between two conserved essential MVA genes (I8R and G1L) using shuttle vector pGeo-MUC1; and to express MUC1, which is inserted into deletion III using shuttle vector pGeo-MUC1. pGeo-MUC1 is constructed with an ampicillin resistance marker, allowing the vector to replicate in bacteria; with two flanking sequences, allowing the vector to recombine with a specific location in the MVA genome; with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) selection marker, allowing the selection of recombinant MVAs; with a sequence homologous to part of Flank 1 of the MVA sequence, enabling removal of the GFP sequence from the MVA vector after insertion of MUC1 into the MVA genome; with a modified H5 (mH5) promoter, which enables transcription of the inserted heterologous gene insert; and with a TAA sequence.

In certain embodiments, the polypeptide, or the nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide, may have a mutation or deletion (e.g., an internal deletion, truncation of the amino- or carboxy-terminus, or a point mutation).

The one or more genes introduced into the recombinant viral vector are under the control of regulatory sequences that direct its expression in a cell.

The nucleic acid material of the viral vector may be encapsulated, e.g., in a lipid membrane or by structural proteins (e.g., capsid proteins), that may include one or more viral polypeptides.

In exemplary embodiments, the present invention is a recombinant viral vector (e.g., a recombinant MVA vector) comprising one or more genes, or one or more polypeptides encoded by the gene or genes, from a TAA.

The nucleic acid sequences of many TAAs are published and are available from a variety of sources, including, e.g., GenBank and PubMed. Exemplary GenBank references including MUC1 include those corresponding to accession numbers NM_001204285.

In certain embodiments, the one or more genes encodes a polypeptide, or fragment thereof, that is substantially identical (e.g., at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or even 100% identical) to the selected TAA over at least 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 contiguous residues of the selected TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof that retain immunogenic activity.

In one embodiment, the sequence encoding a TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof is inserted into deletion site I, II, III, IV, V or VI of the MVA vector.

In one embodiment, the sequence encoding a TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof is inserted between I8R and G1L of the MVA vector, or into restructured and modified deletion III of the MVA vector; and a second sequence encoding a TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof is inserted between I8R and G1L of the MVA vector, or into restructured and modified deletion site III of the MVA vector.

The sequence may be, for example, under the control of a promoter selected from the group consisting of Pm2H5, Psyn II, or mH5 promoters.

The recombinant viral vector of the present invention can be used to infect cells of a subject, which, in turn, promotes the translation into a protein product of the one or more heterologous sequence of the viral vector (e.g., a TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof). As discussed further herein, the recombinant viral vector can be administered to a subject so that it infects one or more cells of the subject, which then promotes expression of the one or more viral genes of the viral vector and stimulates an immune response that is therapeutic or protective against a neoplasm.

In one embodiment, the recombinant MVA vaccine expresses proteins that assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) comprising the TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof. While not wanting to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the TAA is provided to elicit a protective immune response and the matrix protein is provided to enable assembly of VLPs and as a target for T cell immune responses, thereby enhancing the protective immune response and providing cross-protection.

One or more nucleic acid sequences may be optimized for use in an MVA vector. Optimization includes codon optimization, which employs silent mutations to change selected codons from the native sequences into synonymous codons that are optimally expressed by the host-vector system. Other types of optimization include the use of silent mutations to interrupt homopolymer stretches or transcription terminator motifs. Each of these optimization strategies can improve the stability of the gene, improve the stability of the transcript, or improve the level of protein expression from the sequence. In exemplary embodiments, the number of homopolymer stretches in the TAA sequence will be reduced to stabilize the construct. A silent mutation may be provided for anything similar to a vaccinia termination signal. An extra nucleotide may be added in order to express the transmembrane, rather than the secreted, form of any TAA.

In exemplary embodiments, the sequences are codon optimized for expression in MVA; sequences with runs of ≥5 deoxyguanosines, ≥5 deoxycytidines, ≥5 deoxyadenosines, and ≥5 deoxythymidines are interrupted by silent mutation to minimize loss of expression due to frame shift mutations; and the GP sequence is modified through addition of an extra nucleotide to express the transmembrane, rather than the secreted, form of the protein.

Examples of such formulations include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. One exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is physiological saline.

Other physiologically acceptable diluents, excipients, carriers, or adjuvants and their formulations are known to those skilled in the art.

In one embodiment, adjuvants are used as immune response enhancers. In various embodiments, the immune response enhancer is selected from the group consisting of alum-based adjuvants, oil based adjuvants, Specol, RIBI, TiterMax, Montanide ISA50 or Montanide ISA 720, GM-CSF, nonionic block copolymer-based adjuvants, dimethyl dioctadecyl ammoniumbromide (DDA) based adjuvants AS-1, AS-2, Ribi Adjuvant system based adjuvants, QS21, Quil A, SAF (Syntex adjuvant in its microfluidized form (SAF-m), dimethyl-dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA), human complement based adjuvants m. vaccae, ISCOMS, MF-59, SBAS-2, SBAS-4, Enhanzyn®, RC-529, AGPs, MPL-SE, QS7, Escin; Digitonin; and Gypsophila, Chenopodium quinoa saponins.

The compositions utilized in the methods described herein can be administered by a route selected from, e.g., parenteral, intramuscular, intraarterial, intravascular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, dermal, transdermal, ocular, inhalation, buccal, sublingual, perilingual, nasal, topical administration, and oral administration. The preferred method of administration can vary depending on various factors (e.g., the components of the composition being administered and the severity of the condition being treated). Formulations suitable for oral administration may consist of liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the composition dissolved in a diluent (e.g., water, saline, or PEG-400), capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the vaccine. The pharmaceutical composition may also be an aerosol formulation for inhalation, e.g., to the bronchial passageways. Aerosol formulations may be mixed with pressurized, pharmaceutically acceptable propellants (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, or nitrogen).

For the purposes of this invention, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for delivering a therapeutic or biologically active agent can include, e.g., tablets, gelcaps, capsules, pills, powders, granulates, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, gels, hydrogels, oral gels, pastes, eye drops, ointments, creams, plasters, drenches, delivery devices, suppositories, enemas, injectables, implants, sprays, or aerosols. Any of these formulations can be prepared by well-known and accepted methods of art. See, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed.), ed. A. R. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005, and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, ed. J. Swarbrick, Informa Healthcare, 2006, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The immunogenicity of the composition (e.g., vaccine) may be significantly improved if the composition of the present invention is co-administered with an immunostimulatory agent or adjuvant.

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention described herein may be formulated to release the composition immediately upon administration (e.g., targeted delivery) or at any predetermined time period after administration using controlled or extended release formulations. Administration of the pharmaceutical composition in controlled or extended release formulations is useful where the composition, either alone or in combination, has (i) a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the difference between the plasma concentration leading to harmful side effects or toxic reactions and the plasma concentration leading to a therapeutic effect is small; generally, the therapeutic index, TI, is defined as the ratio of median lethal dose (LD50) to median effective dose (ED50)); (ii) a narrow absorption window in the gastro-intestinal tract; or (iii) a short biological half-life, so that frequent dosing during a day is required in order to sustain a therapeutic level.

Many strategies can be pursued to obtain controlled or extended release in which the rate of release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the pharmaceutical composition. For example, controlled release can be obtained by the appropriate selection of formulation parameters and ingredients, including, e.g., appropriate controlled release compositions and coatings. Suitable formulations are known to those of skill in the art. Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles, patches, and liposomes.

Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the vaccine dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline or PEG 400; (b) capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the vaccine, as liquids, solids, granules or gelatin; (c) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; (d) suitable emulsions; and (e) polysaccharide polymers such as chitins. The vaccine, alone or in combination with other suitable components, may also be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation, e.g., to the bronchial passageways. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.

Suitable formulations for rectal administration include, for example, suppositories, which consist of the vaccine with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases include natural or synthetic triglycerides or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which consist of a combination of the vaccine with a base, including, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, and paraffin hydrocarbons.

The vaccines of the present invention may also be co-administered with cytokines to further enhance immunogenicity. The cytokines may be administered by methods known to those skilled in the art, e.g., as a nucleic acid molecule in plasmid form or as a protein or fusion protein.

This invention also provides kits comprising the vaccines of the present invention. For example, kits comprising a vaccine and instructions for use are within the scope of this invention.

Many immunotherapeutic regimens involve antibodies. There are a number of FDA-approved antibodies useful as combination therapies. These antibodies may be selected from Alemtuzumab, Atezolizumab, Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Ofatumumab, Pembrolizumab, or Rituximab.

Monoclonal antibodies that target either PD-1 or PD-L1 can boost the immune response against cancer cells and have shown a great deal of promise in treating certain cancers. Examples of antibodies that target PD-1 include Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. An example of an antibody that targets PD-L1 is Atezolizumab.

CTLA-4 is another protein on some T cells that acts as a type of “off switch” to keep the immune system in check. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to CTLA-4 to block activity and boost an immune response against a neoplasm.

In another embodiment, the immunogenic vector compositions are administered with adjuvant chemotherapy to increase dendritic cell ability to induce T cell proliferation.

In various embodiments, the vector compositions are administered, before, after or at the same time as chemotherapy.

By way of example, some other cancer chemotherapeutic drugs that may be used and may be in stages of clinical trials include: resminostat, tasquinimod, refametinib, lapatinib, Tyverb, Arenegyr, pasireotide, Signifor, ticilimumab, tremelimumab, lansoprazole, PrevOnco, ABT-869, linifanib, tivantinib, Tarceva, erlotinib, Stivarga, regorafenib, fluoro-sorafenib, brivanib, liposomal doxorubicin, lenvatinib, ramucirumab, peretinoin, Ruchiko, muparfostat, Teysuno, tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil, and orantinib.

Manufacturer brand names for some cancer drugs that may be used in the present invention include: NEXAVAR (sorafenb), STIVARGA (regorafenib), AFFINITOR (everolimus), GLEEVEC (imatinib), HALAVEN (eribulin), ALIMTA (pemetrexed), GEMZAR (gemcitabine), VOTRIENT (pazopanib), TYKERB (lapatinib), TAFINIAR (dabrafenib), SUTENT (sutinib malate), XALKORI (crizotinib), TORISEL (torisirolimus), INLYTA (axitinib), IRESSA (gefitinib), ARIMEDEX (anastrole), CASODEX (bicalutamide), FASLODEX (fulvestrant), TOMUDEX (ralitrexed), ZOLADEX (goserilin acetate), TARCEVA (erlotininb), XELODA (capecitabine), ZELBROF (vemurafenib), ERIVEDGE (visiodegib), PERJETA (pertuzumab), HERCEPTIN (trastuzumab), TAXOTERE (docetaxel), JEVTANA (cabazitaxel), ELOXATIN (oxaliplatin), ZALTRAP (ziv-aflibercept), AVASTIN (bevacizumab) Nolvadex, Istubal, and VALODEX (tamoxifen citrate), TEMODAR (temozolomide), SIGNIFOR (pasireotide), VECTIBIX (pantiumumab), ADRIAMYCIN (doxorubicin), DOXIL (pegylated doxorubicin), ABRAXANE (Paclitaxel), TEYSUNO (tegafur, gimeracil, oteracil), BORTEZOMIB (Velcade) and with lenalidomide, ISTODAX (romidepsin).

It is believed that one way that Doxorubicin (ADRIAMYCIN) and DOXIL (pegylated doxorubicin in liposomes) can act to kill cancer cells is by intercalating DNA. It is also thought that doxorubicin can become a nitroxide free radical and/or thereby increase cellular levels of free radicals in cancer cells and thereby trigger cellular damage and programmed death. There are potentially serious adverse systemic effects of doxorubicin such as heart damage which limit its use.

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, Efudex) is a pyrimidine analog which is used in the treatment of cancer. It is a suicide inhibitor and works through irreversible inhibition of thymidylate synthase. Like many anti-cancer drugs, 5-FU's effects are felt system wide but fall most heavily upon rapidly dividing cells that make more frequent use of their nucleotide synthesis machinery, such as cancer cells. 5-FU kills non-cancer cells in parts of the body that are rapidly dividing, for example, the cells lining the digestive tract. Folfori is a treatment with 5-FU, Camptosar, and Irinotecan (leucovorin). The 5-FU incorporates into the DNA molecule and stops synthesis and Camptosar is a topoisomerase inhibitor, which prevents DNA from uncoiling and duplicating. Irinotecan (folinic acid, leucovorin) is a vitamin B derivative used as a “rescue” drug for high doses of the drug methotrexate and that modulates/potentiates/reduces the side effects of the 5-FU (fluorouracil). Mitomycin C is a potent DNA cross-linker. Prolonged use may result in permanent bone-marrow damage. It may also cause lung fibrosis and renal damage.

Taxanes agents include paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere). Taxanes disrupt cell microtubule function. Microtubules are essential to cell division. Taxanes stabilize GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule, thereby inhibiting the process of cell division. Cancer cells can no longer divide. However, taxanes may inhibit cell division of non-cancer cells as well.

Cisplatin(s) which includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin are organic platinum complexes which react in vivo, binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA. The cross-linked DNA triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the cancer cells. However, cisplatins can also trigger apoptosis of non-cancer cells.

Bleomycin induces DNA strand breaks. Some studies suggest bleomycin also inhibits incorporation of thymidine into DNA strands. Bleomycin will also kill non-cancer cells. Melphalen (Alkeran) is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agents which adds an alkyl group to the guanine base of DNA. Major adverse effects of mephalen include vomiting, oral ulceration, and bone marrow suppression.

Plumbagin has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in numerous cancer cell lines. It triggers autophagy via inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway. It induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through JNK-dependent p53 Ser15 phosphorylation. It promotes autophagic cell death. It inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling. It induces intracellular ROS generation in a PI 5-kinase-dependent manner. To non-cancer cells plumbagin is a toxin, a genotoxin, and a mutagen.

A chemotherapeutic agent may be selected based upon its specificity and potency of inhibition of a cellular pathway target to which cancer cells in the patient may be susceptible. In practicing the invention, the chemotherapeutic agent may be selected by its ability to inhibit a cellular pathway target selected from the group consisting of mTORC, RAF kinase, MEK kinase, Phosphoinositol kinase 3, Fibroblast growth factor receptor, multiple tyrosine kinase, Human epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, other angiogenesis, heat shock protein; Smo (smooth) receptor, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor, Apoptosis protein inhibitor, cyclin dependent kinases, deacetylase, ALK tyrosine kinase receptor, serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim-1, Porcupine acyltransferase, hedgehog pathway, protein kinase C, mDM2, Glypciin3, ChK1, Hepatocyte growth factor MET receptor, Epidermal growth factor domain-like 7, Notch pathway, Src-family kinase, DNA methyltransferase, DNA intercalators, Thymidine synthase, Microtubule function disruptor, DNA cross-linkers, DNA strand breakers, DNA alkylators, JNK-dependent p53 Ser15 phosphorylation inducer, DNA topoisomerase inhibitors, Bcl-2, and free radical generators.

In one embodiment, the vector compositions are administered, before, after or at the same time as epigenetic modulators.

In one embodiment, the vector compositions are administered, before, after or at the same time as an epigenetic modulator selected from the group consisting of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases, inhibitors of histone methyltransferases, inhibitors of histone acetyltransferases, inhibitors of histone deacetylases, and inhibitors of lysine demethylases.

In certain embodiments, the shrinkage is such that an inoperable tumor is sufficient to permit resection if desired. The concept of substantial shrinkage may also be referred to as “regression,” which refers to a diminution of a bodily growth, such as a tumor. Such a diminution may be determined by a reduction in measured parameters such as, but not limited to, diameter, mass (i.e., weight), or volume. This diminution by no means indicates that the size is completely reduced, only that a measured parameter is quantitatively less than a previous determination.

In one embodiment, the methods may prevent tumor metastasis.

In exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a proliferative disorder in a subject in need thereof, said method comprising administering the composition of the present invention to the subject in a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, the term “proliferative disorder” refers to a disorder wherein the growth of a population of cells exceeds, and is uncoordinated with, that of the surrounding cells. In certain instances, a proliferative disorder leads to the formation of a tumor. In some embodiments, the tumor is benign, pre-malignant, or malignant. In other embodiments, the proliferative disorder is an autoimmune diseases, vascular occlusion, restenosis, atherosclerosis, or inflammatory bowel disease. In one embodiment, the autoimmune diseases to be treated may be selected from the group consisting of type I autoimmune diseases or type II autoimmune diseases or type III autoimmune diseases or type IV autoimmune diseases, such as, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic polyarthritis, Basedow's disease, autoimmune forms of chronic hepatitis, colitis ulcerosa, allergy type I diseases, allergy type II diseases, allergy type III diseases, allergy type IV diseases, fibromyalgia, hair loss, Bechterew's disease, Crohn's disease, Myasthenia gravis, neuroclermitis, Polymyalgia rheumatica, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), psoriasis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatic arthritis, psoriasis, vasculitis, etc, or type II diabetes.

In a particular embodiment, the immune response comprises production of neutralizing antibodies, non-neutralizing antibodies, and cell-mediated immunity against the TAA.

In certain embodiments, the compositions of the invention can be used as vaccines for treating a subject at risk of developing a neoplasm, or a subject already having a neoplasm. The recombinant viral vector comprises genes or sequences encoding TAAs, viral proteins to promote assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) or additional enzymes to facilitate expression and glycosylation of the TAA.

Typically the vaccines will be in an admixture and administered simultaneously, but may also be administered separately.

A subject to be treated according to the methods described herein may be one who has been diagnosed by a medical practitioner as having such a condition. (e.g. a subject having a neoplasm). Diagnosis may be performed by any suitable means. One skilled in the art will understand that a subject to be treated according to the present invention may have been identified using standard tests or may have been identified, without examination, as one at high risk due to the presence of one or more risk factors.

Prophylactic treatment may be administered, for example, to a subject not yet having a neoplasm but who is susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of developing a neoplasm.

Therapeutic treatment may be administered, for example, to a subject already a neoplasm in order to improve or stabilize the subject's condition. The result is an improved therapeutic profile. In some instances, as compared with an equivalent untreated control, treatment may ameliorate a disorder or a symptom thereof by, e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 100% as measured by any standard technique.

For example, depending upon the type of cancer, an improved therapeutic profile may be selected from alleviation of one or more symptoms of the cancer, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable, tumor regression, inhibition of tumor growth, inhibition of tumor metastasis, reduction in cancer cell number, inhibition of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs, improved time to disease progression (TTP), improved response rate (RR), prolonged overall survival (OS), prolonged time-to-next-treatment (TNTT), or prolonged time from first progression to next treatment, or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

In other embodiments, treatment may result in amelioration of one or more symptoms of a disease associated with a neoplasm (e.g. cancer). According to this embodiment, confirmation of treatment can be assessed by detecting an improvement in or the absence of symptoms.

In one embodiment, the present invention is a method of inducing an immune response in a subject (e.g., a human) by administering to the subject a recombinant viral vector that encodes at least one TAA or immunogenic fragment thereof. The immune response may be a cellular immune response or a humoral immune response, or a combination thereof.

The composition may be administered, e.g., by injection (e.g., intramuscular, intraarterial, intravascular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous).

It will be appreciated that more than one route of administering the vaccines of the present invention may be employed either simultaneously or sequentially (e.g., boosting). In addition, the vaccines of the present invention may be employed in combination with traditional immunization approaches such as employing protein antigens, vaccinia virus and inactivated virus, as vaccines. Thus, in one embodiment, the vaccines of the present invention are administered to a subject (the subject is “primed” with a vaccine of the present invention) and then a traditional vaccine is administered (the subject is “boosted” with a traditional vaccine). In another embodiment, a traditional vaccine is first administered to the subject followed by administration of a vaccine of the present invention. In yet another embodiment, a traditional vaccine and a vaccine of the present invention are co-administered.

While not to be bound by any specific mechanism, it is believed that upon inoculation with a pharmaceutical composition as described herein, the immune system of the host responds to the vaccine by producing antibodies, both secretory and serum, specific for one or more TAA or immunogenic fragments thereof; and by producing a cell-mediated immune response specific for one or more TAA or immunogenic fragments thereof. As a result of the vaccination, the host becomes at least partially or completely immune to one or more TAA or immunogenic fragments thereof, or resistant to developing moderate or severe diseases caused by neoplasm.

In one aspect, methods are provided to alleviate, reduce the severity of, or reduce the occurrence of, one or more of the symptoms associated with a neoplasm comprising administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a recombinant MVA viral vector that comprises TAA and matrix protein sequences optionally co-expressing sequences that facilitate expression of and desired glycosylation the TAA.

In another aspect, the invention provides methods of providing anti-TAA immunity comprising administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a recombinant MVA vaccine expressing TAA and a viral matrix protein to permit the formation of VLPs.

It will also be appreciated that single or multiple administrations of the vaccine compositions of the present invention may be carried out. For example, subjects who are at particularly high risk of developing a neoplasm may require multiple immunizations to establish and/or maintain protective immune responses. Levels of induced immunity can be monitored by measuring amounts of binding and neutralizing secretory and serum antibodies as well as levels of T cells, and dosages adjusted or vaccinations repeated as necessary to maintain desired levels of protection.

In one embodiment, administration is repeated at least twice, at least 3 times, at least 4 times, at least 5 times, at least 6 times, at least 7 times, at least 8 times, or more than 8 times.

In one embodiment, administration is repeated twice.

In one embodiment, about 2-8, about 4-8, or about 6-8 administrations are provided.

In one embodiment, about 1-4-week, 2-4 week, 3-4 week, 1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 4 week or more than 4 week intervals are provided between administrations.

In one specific embodiment, a 4-week interval is used between 2 administrations.

In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of monitoring treatment progress. In exemplary embodiments, the monitoring is focused on biological activity, immune response and/or clinical response.

In one embodiment, the biological activity is a T-cell immune response, regulatory T-cell activity, molecule response (MRD), cytogenic response or conventional tumor response for example, in both the adjuvant or advanced disease setting.

In one embodiment, immune response is monitored for example, by an immunse assay such as a cytotoxicity assay, an intracellular cytokine assay, a tetramer assay or an ELISPOT assay.

In one embodiment, clinical response is monitored for example by outcome using established definitions such as response (tumor regression), progression-free, recurrencefree, or overall survival.

In one embodiment, the method includes the step of determining a level of diagnostic marker marker (e.g., any target delineated herein modulated by a compound herein, a protein or indicator thereof, etc.) or diagnostic measurement (e.g., screen, assay) in a subject having received a therapeutic amount of a compound herein sufficient to treat the disease or symptoms thereof. The level of marker determined in the method can be compared to known levels of marker in either healthy normal controls or in other afflicted patients to establish the subject's disease status. In preferred embodiments, a second level of marker in the subject is determined at a time point later than the determination of the first level, and the two levels are compared to monitor the course of disease or the efficacy of the therapy. In certain preferred embodiments, a pre-treatment level of marker in the subject is determined prior to beginning treatment according to this invention; this pre-treatment level of marker can then be compared to the level of marker in the subject after the treatment commences, to determine the efficacy of the treatment.

In one embodiment, upon improvement of a subject's condition (e.g., a change (e.g., decrease) in the level of disease in the subject), a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.

A. Dosage

The vaccines are administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in such amount as will be therapeutically effective, immunogenic and protective. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, including, for example, the capacity of the immune system of the individual to synthesize antibodies, and, if needed, to produce a cell-mediated immune response. Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of the practitioner and may be monitored on a patient-by-patient basis. However, suitable dosage ranges are readily determinable by one skilled in the art and generally range from about 5.0×106 TCID50 to about 5.0×109 TCID50. The dosage may also depend, without limitation, on the route of administration, the patient's state of health and weight, and the nature of the formulation.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered in such an amount as will be therapeutically effective, immunogenic, and/or protective against a neoplasm that expresses a TAA. The dosage administered depends on the subject to be treated (e.g., the manner of administration and the age, body weight, capacity of the immune system, and general health of the subject being treated). The composition is administered in an amount to provide a sufficient level of expression that elicits an immune response without undue adverse physiological effects. Preferably, the composition of the invention is a heterologous viral vector that includes one or TAAs or immunogenic fragments thereof and large matrix protein; and is administered at a dosage of, e.g., between 1.0×104 and 9.9×1012 TCID50 of the viral vector, preferably between 1.0×105 TCID50 and 1.0×1011 TCID50 pfu, more preferably between 1.0×106 and 1.0×1010 TCID50 pfu, or most preferably between 5.0×106 and 5.0×109 TCID50. The composition may include, e.g., at least 5.0×106 TCID50 of the viral vector (e.g., 1.0×108 TCID50 of the viral vector). A physician or researcher can decide the appropriate amount and dosage regimen.

The composition of the method may include, e.g., between 1.0×104 and 9.9×1012 TCID50 of the viral vector, preferably between 1.0×105 TCID50 and 1.0×1011 TCID50 pfu, more preferably between 1.0×106 and 1.0×1010 TCID50 pfu, or most preferably between 5.0×106 and 5.0×109 TCID50. The composition may include, e.g., at least 5.0×106 TCID50 of the viral vector (e.g., 1.0×108 TCID50 of the viral vector). The method may include, e.g., administering the composition to the subject two or more times.

The term “effective amount” is meant the amount of a composition administered to improve, inhibit, or ameliorate a condition of a subject, or a symptom of a disorder, in a clinically relevant manner (e.g., improve, inhibit, or ameliorate disease associated with a neoplasm (e.g. cancer) or provide an effective immune response to a neoplasm). Any improvement in the subject is considered sufficient to achieve treatment. Preferably, an amount sufficient to treat is an amount that prevents the occurrence or one or more symptoms of disease associated with a neoplasm or is an amount that reduces the severity of, or the length of time during which a subject suffers from, one or more symptoms of disease associated with a neoplasm (e.g., by at least 10%, 20%, or 30%, more preferably by at least 50%, 60%, or 70%, and most preferably by at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or more, relative to a control subject that is not treated with a composition of the invention). A sufficient amount of the pharmaceutical composition used to practice the methods described herein (e.g., the treatment of disease associated with a neoplasm) varies depending upon the manner of administration and the age, body weight, and general health of the subject being treated.

It is important to note that the value of the present invention may never be demonstrated in terms of actual clinical benefit. Instead, it is likely that the value of the invention will be demonstrated in terms of success against a surrogate marker for protection. For an indication such as disease associated with a neoplasm, in which it is impractical or unethical to attempt to measure clinical benefit of an intervention, the FDA's Accelerated Approval process allows approval of a new vaccine based on efficacy against a surrogate endpoint. Therefore, the value of the invention may lie in its ability to induce an immune response that constitutes a surrogate marker for protection.

Similarly, FDA may allow approval of vaccines against TAAs based on its Animal Rule. In this case, approval is achieved based on efficacy in animals.

The composition of the method may include, e.g., between 1.0×104 and 9.9×1012 TCID50 of the viral vector, preferably between 1.0×105 TCID50 and 1.0×1011 TCID50 pfu, more preferably between 1.0×106 and 1.0×1010 TCID50 pfu, or most preferably between 5.0×106 and 5.0×109 TCID50. The composition may include, e.g., at least 5.0×106 TCID50 of the viral vector (e.g., 1.0×108 TCID50 of the viral vector). The method may include, e.g., administering the composition two or more times.

In some instances it may be desirable to combine the TAA vaccines of the present invention with vaccines which induce protective responses to other agents, particularly other TAAs. For example, the vaccine compositions of the present invention can be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially with other genetic immunization vaccines such as those for influenza (Ulmer, J. B. et al., Science 259:1745-1749 (1993); Raz, E. et al., PNAS (USA) 91:9519-9523 (1994)), malaria (Doolan, D. L. et al., J. Exp. Med. 183:1739-1746 (1996); Sedegah, M. et al., PNAS (USA) 91:9866-9870 (1994)), and tuberculosis (Tascon, R. C. et al., Nat. Med. 2:888-892 (1996)).

B. Indications

In specific embodiments, the immunogenic vectors useful in the present methods may be administered to a subject with a neoplasm or a subject diagnosed with prostate, breast, lung, liver, endometrial, bladder, colon or cervical carcinoma; adenocarcinoma; melanoma; lymphoma; glioma; or sarcomas such as soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

In a further embodiment the invention is directed to the vectors of the invention for the treatment or prevention of cancer, including, but not limited to, neoplasms, tumors, metastases, or any disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth, and particularly multidrug resistant forms thereof. The cancer can be a multifocal tumor. Examples of types of cancer and proliferative disorders to be treated with the therapeutics of the invention include, but are not limited to, leukemia (e.g. myeloblastic, promyelocytic, myelomonocytic, monocytic, erythroleukemia, chronic myelocytic (granulocytic) leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's disease), fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, Ewing's tumor, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, testicular tumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, dysplasia and hyperplasia. In a particular embodiment, therapeutic compounds of the invention are administered to patients having prostate cancer (e.g., prostatitis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic paraganglioma, prostate adenocarcinoma, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, prostato-rectal fistulas, and atypical prostatic stromal lesions). In an especially preferred embodiment the medicaments of the present invention are used for the treatment of cancer, glioma, liver carcinoma and/or colon carcinoma. The treatment and/or prevention of cancer includes, but is not limited to, alleviating symptoms associated with cancer, the inhibition of the progression of cancer, the promotion of the regression of cancer, and the promotion of the immune response.

As used herein, the term neoplasm refers to an abnormal growth of tissue. A neoplasm may be benign or malignant. Generally, a malignant neoplasm is referred to as a cancer. Cancers differ from benign neoplasms in the ability of malignant cells to invade other tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue through invasion or by implantation into distant sites by metastasis (i.e., transport through the blood or lymphatic system). The methods of the present invention are suitable for the treatment of benign and malignant neoplasms (cancer).

As defined herein a superficial neoplasm is one located on the outer surface of the body that has confined itself and not spread to surrounding tissues or other parts of the body.

### Example 1. MVA Vaccine Vectors

This Example provides information on exemplary MVA vaccine vectors. An MVA vaccine is constructed using MVA strain 1974/NIH that has been genetically modified to express two other genes: the VP40 protein of Marburgvirus and a chimeric protein consisting of portions of the human MUC1 protein and of the Marburgvirus glycoprotein (GP). The chimeric MUC1/GP gene has more a particular construction of encoding transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain derived from the human MUC1 gene, a transmembrane domain derived from the glycoprotein of Marburgvirus, and the intracellular domain of human MUC1 gene. The methods for creating the MUC1/GP chimeric protein are given in detail in EXAMPLE 2 below. The methods for generating an MVA vaccine genetically modified to express the MUC1/GP and VP40 proteins and the characterization of the hypoglycosylation status of the MUC1 thereby encoded are given in detail in EXAMPLE 3 below.

### Example 3: MVA Vaccine Construction and In Vitro Evaluation for Hypoglycosylated Forms of MUC1

The recombinant MVA vaccine consists of an MVA vector with two antigen expression cassettes (MVA-Muc1VP40). One expression cassette encodes a chimeric form of human Muc1, the construction of which is described in Example 2 above (hereafter this construction is called GVX-Muc1) and which for the purposes of MVA vaccine construction has had its DNA sequence cloned into a shuttle plasmid entitled pGeo-Muc1 (image of plasmid is seen above). One expression cassette encodes the VP40 protein of Marburgvirus. The expression of GVX-Muc1 and VP40 is sufficient to generate secreted virus-like particles (VLPs). The GVX-Muc1 protein is expressed as a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human Muc1, the transmembrane domain of Marburgvirus GP, and the intracellular domain of human Muc1. Marburg VP40 protein is expressed in the cytoplasm of the cells where it associates with the intracellular domain and transmembrane domain of the GVX-Muc1, causing cell-surface budding of VLPs that have GVX-Muc ion their surface and VP40 enclosed in their interior (luminal) space. This novel combination of vector platform and native antigen conformation yields a vaccine that is expected to elicit a strong, broad, and durable immune response. The MVA-Muc1VP40 vaccine candidate was constructed using shuttle vectors developed in the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss and are being licensed by the NIAID to GeoVax for use in vaccine development. These shuttle vectors have proven to yield stable vaccine inserts with high, but non-toxic, levels of expression in our work with HIV and hemorrhagic fever virus vaccines. The Muc1 sequence was placed between two essential genes of MVA (I8R and G1L) and VP40 was inserted into a restructured and modified deletion III between the A50R and B 1R genes, illustrated in the following schematic (FIG. 2), wherein the numbers refer to coordinates in the MVA genome:

The GVX-Muc1 and VP40 genes were codon optimized for MVA. Silent mutations have been introduced to interrupt homo-polymer sequences (>4G/C and >4A/T) to reduce RNA polymerase errors that could lead to frameshifts. Inserted sequences have been edited for vaccinia-specific terminators to remove motifs that could lead to premature termination. All vaccine inserts are placed under the modified H5 early/late vaccinia promoter as described previously. Vectors were being prepared in a dedicated room under “GLP-like conditions” at GeoVax, with full traceability and complete documentation of all steps using Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy/Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE/TSE)-free raw materials.

The expression of full length and native conformation of GVX-Muc1 protein expressed in cells were assessed by western blotting using Muc1-specific antibodies. The MVA-Muc1VP40 vaccine was used to infect DF1 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 1 hour at 37° C. after which time the medium was exchanged for fresh pre-warmed medium. After 48 hours incubation at 37° C. the supernatant of the cells was harvested and clarified by centrifuging at 500×g for 10 minutes. Once the supernatant was removed from the cells, the cells themselves were harvested from the plate, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and were then lysed on ice for 15 minutes in a solution of PBS+1% Triton X-100 detergent. After this incubation, a post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifuging the lysate at 1000×g for 10 minutes and harvesting the liquid layer on top, which is hereafter termed the “cell lysate”. The cell lysates were applied to 10% SDS-PAGE gels and were separated by electrophoresis, then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer, then incubated with a primary antibody that recognizes either (1) the total amount of Muc1 present in the sample, or (2) the total amount of hypoglycosylated Muc1 in the sample. As control, supernatant and cell lysate from DF1 cells infected with parental MVA (a vector control containing none of the antigen expression cassettes). The results of this analysis are seen in the following image of the western blot (FIG. 3):

This demonstrates that the MVA-Muc1VP40 vaccine infects DF1 cells and expresses Muc1 protein and furthermore demonstrates that some proportion of the Muc1 expressed is in hypoglycosylated form.

Evidence of the hypoglycosylated form of Muc1 encoded by the MVA-Muc1VP40 vaccine is seen by immunostaining cells infected with the vaccine or simultaneously staining control cells that are known to express either normally-glycosylated or hypo-glycosylated Muc1, as described here:


- - Control cell lines MCF7 and MCF10A both express Muc1. 293T cells do
    not.
  - MCF7 cell express hypo-glycosylated Muc1, recognized by a
    hypoglycosylated Muc1-specific Ab (4H5).
  - MCF10A expresses normal Muc1. A pan-Muc1 Ab (HMPV) is used to detect
    total Muc1.
  - 293T cells were infected with MVA-Muc1VP40 or MVA control virus
    (parental MVA).
  - All samples were stained with the indicated Abs.
  - Note in the following image (FIG. 4) the negative signal (yellow
    background) in Staining Negative Control and the MVA control
    conditions; positive signal is reddish brown above the yellow
    background:

VLP formation was shown by immune-electron microscopy (EM) using of DF1 cells infected with the MVA-Muc1VP40 vaccine and stained with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes Muc1 (HMPV). In the EM image below (FIG. 5) two thing are clearly illustrated: (1) that the VLPs are filamentous, a phenomenon derivative of the fact that the VP40 protein is used as the matrix protein that drive VLP budding from the surface of cells; and (2) that the VLPs stain positively with the antibody directed against Muc1, demonstrating that this protein is incorporated into the budding VLPs.

### Example 4: Targeted Diminution of O-Linked Glycosylation of Muc1

Introduction

Mucin-type O-glycosylation begins with modification of proteins by addition of the core 1 O-glycan Galβ3-GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr. This occurs in two steps: (1) a GalNAc is covalently attached to a Serine or Threonine of the amino acid backbone; (2) a Gal is then added to the GalNAc. An enormous variety of other glycoforms are created from this core structure by the addition of other sugars to the core 1 structure. A schematic of this initial modification pathway is as shown in FIG. 6.

This results in the formation of the T antigen carbohydrate on Ser or Thr residues of the protein backbone. Importantly, functional T synthase (also known as core 1 β3-galactosyl transferase, gene symbol C1GALT1) is the only known enzyme responsible for formation of the T antigen from the Tn antigen. Subsequent further modifications of the core 1 carbohydrate structure are completely dependent upon the formation of T antigen. In the absence of T synthase, therefore, O-linked glycosylation that depends on the core 1 structure ceases with the formation of Tn antigen (see Aryal, R. P., Ju, T. & Cummings, R. D., J Biol Chem 289, 11630-11641 (2014)). As a caveat, an additional mechanism for hypoglycosylation involves the addition of a sialic acid onto Tn by α-2,6-sialyl transferase I (gene symbol ST6GALNAC1), resulting in a terminal (non-extendable) sialyl-Tn structure (Siaα2-6GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), illustrated as shown in FIG. 7.

The goal is to ensure endogenous in vivo production of hypoglycosylated Muc1. While overexpression of Muc1 in cells is likely to overwhelm the glycosylation machinery of many cells, it may be amenable to our purposes to additionally push the biosynthetic pathway toward hypoglycosylation of Muc1 by tampering with the glycosylation machinery. Muc1 structures that terminate O-linked glycosylation with the Tn antigen and sialyl-Tn are predominant species among the known hypoglycosylated forms that are associated with a number of carcinomas. Given what is known about the O-linked glycosylation synthesis pathway, two readily recognizable mechanisms can be envisioned for driving endogenous hypoglycosylation of Muc1:

(1) Prevent the formation of T antigen and promote the abundance of Tn antigen by knocking down the expression of functional T synthase. This can be done by either:

a. Directly targeting transcripts of the T synthase gene by siRNA methods; or

Targeting transcripts of COSMC (gene symbol C1GALT1C1) by siRNA methods, as COSMC is known to be essential and specific for the folding and function of T synthase in the ER, and mutations in this X-linked gene have been associated in humans with Tn syndrome.

(2) Over-express α-2,6-sialyl transferase I (gene symbol ST6GALNAC1, herein abbreviated as ‘ST1’) to terminate O-linked glycosylation with sialyl-Tn.

Methods

Summary data on the three genes of interest are provided as follows:

T synthase (C1GALT1)

The C1GALT1 gene is 66,104 nt long, composed of 6 exons, and located at human chromosome 7p21.3. This is transcribed and spliced to yield a 6244 nt long mRNA (NM_020156). A start codon is located at nt 224 of the mRNA and the CDS spans 1092 nt from 224 . . . 1315, yielding a 363 amino acid protein (NP_064541) with a calculated molecular weight of 42 kD. Amino acid residues 7 . . . 29 are predicted to encode a transmembrane domain and the ectodomain of the protein is known to reside in the lumen of the ER, indicating that T synthase is a single pass Type II membrane protein.

COSMC (T synthase-specific chaperone; C1GALT1C1)

The C1GALT1C1 gene is 4476 nt long, composed of 3 exons, and located on the human X chromosome at Xq24. This is transcribed and spliced to yield a 1915 nt long mRNA (NM_152692). A start codon is located at nt 412 of the mRNA and the CDS spans 957 nt from 412 . . . 1368, yielding a 318 amino acid protein (NP_689905) with a calculated molecular weight of 36 kD. Amino acid residues 7 . . . 26 are predicted to encode a transmembrane domain and the ectodomain of the protein is known to reside in the lumen of the ER, indicating that COSMC is a single pass Type II membrane protein.

ST1 (α-2,6-sialyl transferase I; ST6GALNAC1)

The ST6GALNAC1 gene is 26,064 nt long, composed of 12 exons, and located at human chromosome 17q25.1. This is transcribed and spliced to yield a 2593 nt long mRNA (NM_018414). A start codon is located at nt 201 of the mRNA and the CDS spans 1803 nt from 201 . . . 2003, yielding a 600 amino acid protein (NP_060884) with a calculated molecular weight of 68 kD. Amino acid residues 15 . . . 35 are predicted to encode a transmembrane domain and the ectodomain of the protein is known to be exposed to the lumen of the ER upon translocation, indicating that ST1 is a single pass Type II membrane protein.

Established methods for siRNA design, to be applied to the human T synthase and COSMC genes, are as follows:

1. Find 21 nt sequences in the target mRNA that begin with an AA dinucleotide.

2. Select 2-4 target sequences, with the following parameters:

siRNAs with 30-50% GC content are more active than those with a higher G/C content.

Since a 4-6 nucleotide poly(T) tract acts as a termination signal for RNA pol III, avoid stretches of >4 T's or A's in the target sequence when designing sequences to be expressed from an RNA pol III promoter.

Since some regions of mRNA may be either highly structured or bound by regulatory proteins, select siRNA target sites at different positions along the length of the gene sequence. No correlation has been observed between the position of target sites on the mRNA and siRNA potency.

Compare the potential target sites to the appropriate genome database (human, mouse, rat, etc.) and eliminate from consideration any target sequences with more than 16-17 contiguous base pairs of homology to other coding sequences.

3. Design appropriate controls.

A negative control siRNA with the same nucleotide composition as the siRNA but which lacks significant sequence homology to the genome. Scramble the nucleotide sequence of the gene-specific siRNA and conduct a search to make sure it lacks homology to any other gene.

Additional siRNA sequences targeting the same mRNA. Perform experiments, using a single siRNA at a time, with two or more different siRNAs targeting the same gene.

MVA-driven expression of the ST1 should be straightforward, as the CDS for this gene product is only ˜1800 nt in length.

Cell Lines

HEK-293T cells are known to be negative for expression of Muc1 (see Mehanta, et al, PLoS ONE, 2008). T47D cells (derived from human mammary gland carcinoma) endogenously express Muc1, are grown in standard medium (RPMI), and are transfectable. These cells have been used for Muc1 knockdown (KD) studies in the abovementioned publication and may be amenable to our research/early characterization studies of Muc1 hypoglycosylation. T47D cells are available from ATCC (Cat. No. HTB-133) for $431. Olja Finn mentioned that there is a series of cell lines based on the MCF-7 line that are useful for carcinoma studies. In particular she recommended MCF-10A in this series, as it is known to express high levels of fully-glycosylated Muc1 (see also Olja's paper: Cascio, et al, J Biol Chem, 2011). MCF-10A is a transformed, non-tumorigenic adherent epithelial cell line derived from the mammary gland of a 36-year old Caucasian female with fibrocystic disease. The cell line is suitable as a transfection host, according to ATCC, where the cell line is available for $431 (Cat. No. CRL-10317). This cell line uses Mammalian Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (MEGM) from Lonza, supplemented with the Lonza MEGM Bullet Kit (without the gentamicin/amphotericin-B supplement) and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma).

Transient Expression Constructs

In looking at the products available for gene manipulation from Origene (www.origene.com), it was found that they provide both vetted RNAi reagents in ready-to-use formats, as well as vetted ORFs in ready-to-use plasmids. For RNAi methods, the two most appropriate reagents for our purposes would be either synthetic siRNA duplexes, or shRNA constructs that can be expressed from a plasmid. Since, with any success, we would be aiming to express the RNAi products from the MVA vector itself, it would be most amenable to these ends to work with shRNA, which should be easily transferred over to an MVA expression system. Origen offers shRNA products in a number of different formats, but we would want a simple expression vector that is selectable for prepping plasmids (Kan(r) and Cam(r) are offered) and reportable (GFP and RFP are offered). Thus we will order shRNA constructs targeting C1GALT1 (in plasmid pGFP-V-RS, with GFP reporter: Cat. No. TG306064) and C1GALT1C1 (in plasmid pRFP-C-RS, with RFP reporter: Cat. No. TF317130). Both plasmids drive shRNA transcription with a U6 promoter. Maps for these plasmids are shown below.

The abovementioned shRNA products are provided with 4 shRNAs each. Each shRNA will be independently tested for KD. They have target sequences and mRNA coordinates as follows.

Origene shRNA products targeting C1GALT1 (T synthase), with mRNA coordinates (NM_020156):

Origene shRNA products targeting C1GALT1C1 (COSMC), with mRNA coordinates (NM_152692):

KD of these gene products can be assessed by either RT-PCR or WB.

For driving expression of ST1, a construct is readily available from Origene. The product of interest (Cat. No. RC216697) contains the full-length ST6GALNAC1 gene, driven by the CMV promoter, and tagged on the C-terminal with Myc and DDK (FLAG) tags, all in the Origene pCMV6-Entry vector (see RC216687 below).

Experimental Plan

1. Preliminary Experiments

Make whole cell lysates (WCL) of HEK293T or HeLa cells. Use WCL to optimize WB methods for detection of T-synthase (with rb pAb) and COSMC (with ms mAb). Use anti-ms IR700 dye and anti-rb IR800 dye as secondaries, to allow subsequent simultaneous detection of the two antigens on the same WB and such simultaneous detection will be important when assaying the effects of shRNA KD of transcripts.

Set up and bank MCF 10A cells.

Transfect MCF 10A cells with innocuous GFP-encoding plasmid to determine basal level of transfection efficiency.

Make MCF 10A WCL. Test for expression levels of T-synthase and COSMC by WB.

Test anti-Muc1 Abs for WB and flow cytometry using MCF10A cells.

Transfect MCF10A cells individually with each of the 4 shRNA plasmids targeting T-synthase.

Make WCL of each transfected population at prescribed time points. Analyze WCL for expression of T-synthase, COSMC, Muc1, and hypoglycosylated Muc1 (hgMuc1).

Select shRNA that yields the best KD response.

Transfect MCF10A cells with optimal shRNA. Use flow cytometry to analyze cells for surface expression of Muc1 and hgMuc1.

shRNA KD of COSMC in MCF10A Cells

Transfect MCF10A cells individually with each of the 4 shRNA plasmids targeting COSMC.

Make WCL of each transfected population at prescribed time points. Analyze WCL for expression of T-synthase, COSMC, Muc1, and hypoglycosylated Muc1 (hgMuc1).

Select shRNA that yields the best KD response.

Transfect MCF10A cells with optimal shRNA. Use flow cytometry to analyze cells for surface expression of Muc1 and hgMuc1.

2. Pivotal Experiments (Continued)

Ectopic expression of ST1 (ST6GALNAC1 sialyl transferase) in MCF10A cells.

Transfect MCF 10A cells with RC216697 plasmid encoding ST1 behind a CMV promoter.

Assess viability and make WCL of transfected cells at prescribed time points. Analyze WCL for expression of ST1 (detected by anti-DDK antibody), Muc1, and hypoglycosylated Muc1 (hgMuc1).

Transfect MCF 10A cells with RC216697 plasmid. Use flow cytometry to analyze cells for surface expression of Muc1 and hgMuc1.

In light of results from the pivotal experiments above, determine whether to proceed with one of the single approaches investigated, or to attempt combining approaches. One could conceive, for instance of attempting a double-KD of both T-synthase and COSMC by shRNA if neither individually yielded sufficient results, or to co-transfect either shRNA along with the RC216697 plasmid driving expression of ST1.

If ST1 will be used, proceed with having this gene synthesized in vaccinia codon-optimized form.
