                                "As a magnetoresistance effect element, the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) element composed of a multilayer film of a ferromagnetic layer and a non-magnetic layer; and the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) element using an insulating layer (tunnel barrier layer, barrier layer) as the non-magnetic layer are known. In general, the TMR element has a higher element resistance and a higher magnetic resistance (MR) ratio than the GMR element. Therefore, attention is focused on TMR elements as elements for magnetic sensors, high frequency components, magnetic heads and nonvolatile random access memories (MRAM).",
                                "The MRAM reads and writes data by utilizing the characteristic that the element resistance of the TMR element varies when the directions of magnetization of the two ferromagnetic layers sandwiching the insulating layer are changed. As a writing method of MRAM, a method in which writing (magnetization inversion) is performed by utilizing a magnetic field generated by a current (magnetization reversal); and a method in which writing is performed by utilizing a spin transfer torque (STT) generated by applying a current in a laminating direction of a magnetoresistance effect element (magnetization reversal), are known.",
                                "Although the magnetization reversal of the TMR element using STT is efficient from the viewpoint of energy efficiency, the reversal current density for magnetization reversal is high. From the viewpoint of the long life of the TMR element, it is desirable that the reversal current density is low. This also applies to the GMR element.",
                                "In recent years, attention has been focused on magnetization reversal utilizing a pure spin current generated by spin-orbit interaction, which performs magnetization reversal by a mechanism different from that of STT (for example, I. M. Miron, K. Garello, G Gaudin, P.-J. Zermatten, M. V. Costache, S. Auffret, S. Bandiera, B. Rodmacq, A. Schuhl, and P. Gambardella, Nature, 476, 189 (2011)).",
                                "Although this mechanism has not been fully clarified yet, it is believed that the pure spin current generated by the spin-orbit interaction or the Rashba effect at the interface of dissimilar materials induces the spin-orbit torque (SOT), and magnetization reversal occurs due to SOT. Pure spin current is generated by the same number of upward spin electrons and downward spin electrons flowing in mutually opposite directions, and the flow of electric charges is canceled. Therefore, the current flowing through the magnetoresistance effect element is zero, and it is expected that the service life of the magnetoresistance effect element is extended by utilizing the characteristics.",

                                "The spin-orbit torque wiring 2 is made of a material which generates a pure spin current by a spin Hall effect when current flows. The spin-orbit torque wire 2 is not limited to a material made of a single element, but may be composed of a part made of a material that is likely to generate a pure spin current and a part that is made of a material that is difficult to generate a pure spin current and the like.",
                                "The spin Hall effect is a phenomenon in which a pure spin current is induced in a direction orthogonal to the current direction based on the spin-orbit interaction when a current is passed through the material. The mechanism by which a pure spin current is generated by the spin Hall effect is explained below.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 1, when a potential difference is applied to both ends of the spin-orbit torque wiring 2 in the x direction, current flows along the x direction. When current flows, the first spin S1 oriented in the \u2212y direction and the second spin S2 oriented in the +y direction are each bent in a direction orthogonal to the current. Although FIG. 1 illustrates that the first spin S1 is bent toward the first ferromagnetic layer 1, the bending direction may be reversed. That is, the first spin S1 may be bent in the \u2212z direction and the second spin may be bent in the +z direction. The normal Hall effect and the spin Hall effect are common in that the movement (moving) electric charge (electron) is bent in the movement (moving) direction. On the other hand, in the normal Hall effect, charged particles moving in a magnetic field undergo Lorentz force to bend the direction of motion, whereas in the spin Hall effect the movement direction of spin is bend by only electrons moving (only with current flow) without the presence of magnetic field, which is the major difference between them.",
                                "Since the number of electrons in the first spin S1 is equal to the number of electrons in the second spin S2 in the non-magnetic material (material which is not ferromagnetic material), the number of electrons in the first spin S1 going upward in the figure and the number of electrons in the second spin S2 going downward in the fire are the same. Therefore, the current as a net flow of charge is zero. This spin current unassociated with current is called the pure spin current specifically.",
                                "When electric current is passed through the ferromagnetic material, the point that the first spin S1 and the second spin S2 are bent in opposite directions is the same as in the case of the non-magnetic material. On the other hand, in the ferromagnetic material, either one of the first spin S1 or the second spin S2 is in a state of being in excess. As a result, a net flow of charges occurs (voltage is generated). Therefore, as a material of the spin-orbit torque wire 2, a material consisting only of a ferromagnetic material is not included.",
                                "Here, the flow of electrons in the first spin S1 is defined as J\u2191, the flow of electrons in the second spin S2 as J\u2193, and the spin current as IS, it is defined by JS=J\u2191\u2212J\u2193. The pure spin current JS flows in the z direction in the figure. Here, JS is a flow of electrons with a polarizability of 100%.",
                                "In FIG. 1, when a ferromagnetic material is brought into contact with the upper surface of the spin-orbit torque wiring 2, the pure spin current diffuses and flood into the ferromagnetic material. That is, spin is injected into the first ferromagnetic layer 1.",
