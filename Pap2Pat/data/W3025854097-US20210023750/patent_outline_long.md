## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- direct-writing Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology
- printed traces undergo transfer process into polymeric part
- control of relative plastic/ink and mold/ink interfacial strengths
- creation of quality ink/mold interface
- ink/polymer interface controlled by surface roughness and energy
- design of material systems for stronger or weaker surface adhesion
- hybrid molding process chain for production of plastic parts
- combination of ink dispensing technologies with plastic injection molding
- nano-particle ink printed, cured, and sintered before molding
- ink systems embedded in polymer parts and released from mold surface
- interactions at mold/ink/polymer interfaces relate topography parameters
- surface energy and contact angle of hot polymer melt
- FIG. 1 is a context diagram of a molding environment
- mold formed from suitable mold material
- circuit design specifies instructions for printing circuit traces
- print medium deposits traces of ink fluid or paste onto mold surface
- mold sealed and injection molding nozzle engaged
- molten polymer injected into mold cavity
- molded article expelled from mold
- adhesive interface between molded article and traces
- surface energies resulting from sprayed ink and mold surface
- control of interfaces for selective release
- voids created by causing adhesive interface to be stronger
- surface treatment layer to improve surface energy matching
- surface treatment deposited using liquid phase deposition method
- in-situ cure prior to deposition of traces
- surface treatment aids either trace retention or void formation
- molded article released from mold with circuits and features
- FIG. 2 is a process diagram of a molding process
- applying surface treatment to mold surface
- ink formed from particles of trace material surrounded by functionalization agent
- spray or deposition process deposits ink onto mold surface
- particles remain coated with functionalization agent
- curing and sintering of deposited ink
- molding substance added to mold to form article
