    "title": "Heat transfer increase by convection in liquid-infused surfaces for laminar and turbulent flows",
    "date": "2022-04-26",
    "abstract": "Liquid-infused surfaces (LIS) can reduce friction drag in both laminar and turbulent flows. However, the heat transfer properties of such multi-phase surfaces have still not been investigated to a large extent. We use numerical simulations to study conjugate heat transfer of liquid-filled grooves. It is shown that heat transfer can increase for both laminar and turbulent liquid flows due to recirculation in the surface texture. For the increase to be substantial, the thermal conductivity of the solid must be similar to the thermal conductivity of the fluids, and the recirculation in the grooves must be sufficiently strong (P'eclet number larger than 1). The ratio of the surface cavity to the system height is an upper limit of the direct contribution from the recirculation. While this ratio can be significant for laminar flows in microchannels, it is limited for turbulent flows, where the system scale (e.g. channel height) usually is much larger than the texture height. However, heat transfer enhancement on the order of $10%$ is observed (with a net drag reduction) in a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number $Re_tau approx 180$. It is shown that the turbulent convection in the bulk can be enhanced indirectly from the recirculation in the grooves.",

                "The simultaneous increase of heat transfer and reduction of drag in laminar and turbulent fluid flows has turned out to be a considerable challenge. Such technology could lower the power input required for driving the flow in heat exchangers, microprocessors and other thermal systems. A common technique to increase heat transfer in applications is to use rough or modified walls (figure 1a). While roughness, grooves, blades, ridges and corrugations increase the surface heat flux, they also increase the momentum transport, resulting in increased drag (Rohsenow et al. 1998). Enhancement of heat transfer in pipes, channels and ducts can also be achieved by miniaturisation since this increases the surface-to-volume ratio. Effectively, more liquid is then in contact with the surface for a given volume flow rate. However, reduced dimensions also lead to increased wall friction so that the required pressure drop (and pumping power) increases.",
                "Both heat transfer increase and drag reduction can be achieved with complex surfaces having multiple degrees of freedom to tune the surface-flow interaction. One example is a liquid-infused surface (LIS). The infusing liquid creates dynamic interfaces that induce a slipping effect on the external flow while affecting wall-normal velocity fluctuations (figure 1b). The careful design of texture topology, liquid viscosity, thermal conductivity and surface tension enables the precise tuning of transport processes.",
                "In previous studies, superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) have been used to reduce friction while maintaining the benefits of reduced system size (see the review by Gong et al. 2021). Similar effects could be accomplished with a LIS. An analytical model of heat transfer in pipes with SHS or LIS, taking the reduced friction into account, was recently developed by Hatte & Pitchumani (2021). Indeed, reducing the pipe radius increased the advantage of using SHS and LIS. Ciri & Leonardi (2021) designed LIS and SHS that increased heat transfer and decreased drag in direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow. Out of the many investigated surface configurations, this occurred only for SHS with longitudinal grooves, dynamic interfaces and a gas-liquid thermal conductivity ratio of one. The solid structures were also assumed to have a constant temperature. A thermal conductivity ratio of one and isothermal textures are hard to realise in practice, however.",
                "If the thermal conductivity of the solid texture is similar to a contiguous liquid, the heat flux in neither phase is trivial. These solid-liquid combinations are not rare in applications. For example, water has a higher thermal conductivity than polymer polydimethylsiloxane. LIS made from such materials can be expected to have a very different heat flux compared with LIS with isothermal surface textures. For metal solids, liquid metals may be used as infusing liquids. There has recently been an increased interest in using liquid gallium alloys with low toxicity in stretchable electronics (Dickey 2017). The thermal conductivity of gallium is comparable to that of steel. An overview of some properties of representative solids and liquids is given in table 1.",
                "Using liquid and solid properties similar to those of existing materials, we have investigated whether convection in the texture of LIS with transverse grooves can increase the surface heat flux, considering both laminar and turbulent flows. This mode of heat transfer has either been neglected or has not been evaluated closer in earlier works. The study was performed by numerically solving the equations for the velocity and 941 A9-2  temperature fields. We considered the heat transfer between two external boundaries of different temperature. The heat transport mechanisms of this set-up are shown in figure 2(a). The remainder of the article has the following structure. Governing equations and definitions of relevant quantities are presented in \u00a7 2. In \u00a7 3, it is shown that the contribution from the convection in the texture to the total heat flux is necessary to consider when the thermal conductivity of the solid structures is similar to the infusing liquid. Setting the solid and liquid thermal conductivities to the same value, the relation between the surface convection, liquid, flow and geometric properties is described in \u00a7 4. Results from turbulent flow simulations are presented in \u00a7 5. Conclusions are given in \u00a7 6."

The streamwise coordinate is x, the wall-normal y, with y = 0 at the surface, and the spanwise z. Equations (2.1) and (2.2) are valid in the domains occupied by the external fluid and the infusing (internal) liquid. In the region occupied by the solid, only (2.3) is valid and u = 0. The differences between the fluid properties can be expressed through the viscosity ratio \u03bc i /\u03bc \u221e , the density ratio \u03c1 i /\u03c1 \u221e , the specific heat capacity ratio c p,i /c p,\u221e and the thermal conductivity ratio \u03ba i /\u03ba \u221e , where the subscripts i and \u221e refer to the infusing and external fluids, respectively.

We have neglected interface deformation, which is equivalent to imposing an infinite surface tension. Consequently, the wall-normal velocity component v is zero at interfaces. The temperature and the (instantaneous and local) heat flux are continuous at solid boundaries and interfaces. Also, the temperature is a passive scalar, i.e. the momentum equation is independent of the energy equation.",

The solid slab allows for temperature variations below the grooves in the simulations. The derivation is outlined in Appendix A.

Dispersive fluctuations ( \u1e7d and T) are time-averaged deviations from the mean due to the spatially varying surface properties, and random fluctuations (v and T ) are the remaining (turbulent) fluctuations.",

Each of these terms has its counterpart before the equality sign in the same order. They also correspond to the heat transport mechanisms represented in figure 2(a). It is mainly the recirculation in the grooves that gives rise to \u1e7d T , which results in q conv,d .

The contour levels of the temperature field have less spacing in the region of higher conductivity. They are also distorted in and around the grooves due to convection. The convection increases the temperature on the left side of the cavity and decreases it on the right side. We computed the heat fluxes through the different groove walls and the interface for the simulation in figure 4(b). These fluxes are also illustrated with arrows in the figure. Heat is transferred into (out of) the groove through the bottom wall (interface) and the right (left) wall. Through the interface, the heat flux was q I /q = 1.071, i.e. slightly more than the average heat flux of the surface.

The groove height corresponds to k + \u2248 9. All wall units were based on the friction velocity of the lower surface, computed from the balance between the applied volume force in the external flow and the wall-shear stress of the smooth upper wall. The wall-unit scaled groove dimensions correspond roughly to LIS used in experiments by Fu et al. (2019). We imposed constant temperatures T u and T l at the upper and lower boundaries, respectively, similar to the laminar configuration. The viscosity ratio was set to \u03bc i /\u03bc \u221e = 0.4, corresponding roughly to heptane-water (table 1). The solid thermal conductivity was \u03ba s = \u03ba i . We performed three simulations with Prandtl numbers Pr \u221e = 1, 2, and 4, respectively. These simulations were also conducted with smooth walls, replacing the grooves with solid material.

                        "respectively (table 2). As shown in figure 9, for all these cases, the increase in q conv,r /q 0 dominates the change in the heat flux. However, the main reason behind the enhancement of q conv,r /q 0 is the small but finite value of q conv,d /q, as will be shown later in this section. First, however, we note that if (4.4) is valid also for turbulent flows, then the upper limit of q conv,d /q for the turbulent flow set-up is 2.4 %. For a corresponding symmetric channel, the upper limit would be 4.5 %. The potential contribution from q conv,d /q is, therefore, somewhat restricted for this set-up. Figure 10(a) shows \u03c1c p \u1e7d T /q = \u1e7d T + from turbulent and laminar simulations for the same Reynolds number Re i = 29. The agreement between the two systems is reasonably good and we can thus use the laminar flow to interpret the turbulent simulations. This is also corroborated by figure 10(b), where q conv,d /q is compared with (4.3), corresponding to figure 7(a) for the laminar simulations. Indeed, earlier studies indicate that dispersive quantities of rough-wall flow can be reproduced by laminar flow if the offset of the mean velocity in the logarithmic region compared with smooth-wall flow is small ( U + 2) (Abderrahaman-Elena, Fairhall & Garc\u00eda-Mayoral 2019). Correspondence between the laminar and turbulent results of \u1e7d T + is therefore expected here. In the following, we rewrite (5.1) to gain a better insight into the role of the random fluctuations in the heat transfer process. The conduction term corresponds to",
                        "where Nu 0 is the Nusselt number of the smooth-wall flow. Figure 10(a) compares the convective heat flux of a smooth and LIS, where we observe only minor changes in the random component, v T + . We introduce the difference in q conv,r /q between the flow over the LIS and in the smooth channel = q conv,r q -q 0 conv,r q 0 . (5.3) It follows that q conv,r q 0 = q 0 conv,r q 0 q q 0 + q q 0 = 1 -1 Nu 0 q q 0 + q q 0 , (5.4) using q 0 conv,r /q 0 = 1q 0 cond /q 0 and (5.2) in the second step. Assuming = 0, the ratio of the random convection to the total heat flux, q conv,r /q, does not change for the flow over LIS compared with the smooth-wall flow. Accordingly, q conv,r /q 0 is proportional to q/q 0 . Now, using (5.2) and (5.4), (5.1) can be written as q q 0 = 1 + Nu 0 q conv,d q 0 + q q 0 . (5.5) Assuming = 0, we have virtually eliminated q conv,r /q 0 and q cond /q 0 from (5.1); instead Nu 0 acts as amplification factor for q conv,d /q 0 . For a laminar flow Nu 0 = 1, i.e. there is no amplification. On the other hand, if there are random fluctuations in the flow, Nu 0 = q 0 conv,r /q 0 cond + 1, demonstrating how Nu 0 increases due to convection. Hence, Nu 0 is a measure of the amplification of q conv,d /q 0 by the random fluctuations. Indeed, this 941 A9-13 amplification can be substantial. Values measured from the simulations with smooth walls were Nu 0 = 5.8, 7.5 and 9.3 for Pr \u221e = 1, 2 and 4, respectively (table 2). This effect can be expected to increase with increasing bulk Reynolds or Prandtl numbers; Kim & Lee (2020) noticed that Nu 0 increases linearly with Re \u03c4 for a channel with smooth isothermal walls. As q/q 0 increases due to the dispersive convection, so does q conv,r /q 0 by (5.4)."

According to the Reynolds analogy, 2St/C f = 1 for flow over smooth walls with Pr \u221e = 1 (Kestin & Richardson 1963). Changes in the heat flux to drag ratio when introducing surface modifications at this Prandtl number thus indicate a breakage of the Reynolds analogy. A growth or a reduction equal increased or decreased heat transfer efficiency, respectively. However, the exact value of 2St/C f for smooth-wall flows depends on the normalisation used to form the non-dimensional numbers. The heat flux to drag ratio normalised with the smooth-wall reference values, (q/q 0 )(\u03c4 0 /\u03c4 ), is a valid measure of the heat transfer efficiency independently of the Prandtl number. This quantity is reported in table 2. Since both q/q 0 > 1 and \u03c4 0 /\u03c4 > 1 for the current set-up, (q/q 0 )(\u03c4 0 /\u03c4 ) exceeds unity, having a maximum value of 1.17 for Pr \u221e = 4. For LIS and SHS with isothermal solids, it ranges between 0.9 and 1.2 (Ciri & Leonardi 2021). Rough walls with either irregular (Forooghi, Stripf & Frohnapfel 2018)  (such as transverse bars or rods (Leonardi et al. 2015)) have been seen to reduce the Reynolds analogy factor."

                "For LIS with transverse grooves, shear stress due to the external flow induces recirculation in the cavities. This recirculation increases the heat transfer by dispersive convection, contributing q conv,d to the total heat flux. A net increase in the heat flux compared with a smooth surface, q/q 0 > 1, can be achieved in laminar flows if the thermal conductivity of the solid is similar to or smaller than the conductivity of infusing liquid, \u03ba s \u03ba i . If \u03ba s \u2248 \u03ba i , q conv,d may be essential. Therefore, we have investigated the convection for \u03ba s = \u03ba i in greater detail. The ratio q conv,d /q can be expressed as a function of the P\u00e9clet number based on the slip velocity and the groove height, Pe i . This function resembles a logarithmic function in the interval 10 1 < Pe i < 10 3 , (4.3). The same approximation is also applicable for turbulent external flow.",
                "Dispersive convection occurs only inside and in the vicinity of the surface. Therefore, apart from the dependency on Pe i , q conv,d is proportional to the ratio of the groove height to the total system height. This ratio is also an approximate upper limit of q conv,d /q (4.4). For turbulent flows, the convection from random fluctuations in the bulk flow, q conv,r , dominates. However, q conv,r /q changes only slightly from the smooth-wall flow. Therefore, the dispersive convection can amplify the heat flux considerably even for turbulent flows, as expressed by (5.6).",
                "The convection in the LIS texture could be used in applications to achieve increased heat transfer. Numerous liquids can be used for LIS, whereas constraints on solid surface materials, such as weight, could limit their thermal conductivity. Low weight, for example, has been a driving force in the increased usage of micro heat exchangers (Dixit & Ghosh 2015). In addition to the increased surface heat flux, the slip induced by the LIS leads to reduced friction which lowers the required power input (Hatte & Pitchumani 2021). These two properties make LIS augmented convective heat transfer a promising method for achieving more efficient heat exchangers.",
