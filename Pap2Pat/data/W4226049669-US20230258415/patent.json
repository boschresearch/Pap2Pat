                        "The simultaneous increase of heat transfer and reduction of drag in laminar and turbulent fluid flows has turned out to be a considerable challenge. Such technology could lower the power input required for driving the flow in heat exchangers, microprocessors, and other thermal systems. A common technique to increase heat transfer in applications is to use rough or modified walls. While surface roughness, grooves, blades, ridges, and corrugations increase the surface heat flux, they also increase the momentum transport, resulting in increased drag. Enhancement of heat transfer in pipes, channels, and ducts can also be achieved by miniaturization since this increases the surface-to-volume ratio. Effectively, more liquid is then in contact with the surface for a given volume flow rate. However, reduced dimensions also lead to increased wall friction so that the required pressure drop (and pumping power) increases."

As used herein, the term \u201cmicro-scale\u201d with respect to a feature means that at least one dimension of the feature has a length-scale of less than one millimeter but no less than one micrometer. As used herein, the term \u201cnano-scale\u201d with respect to a feature means that at least one dimension of the feature has a length-scale of less than one micrometer. Each groove may have a width 115 and depth 116. In some embodiments, both the width and depth are micro-scale. In some embodiments, both the width and depth are nano-scale. In some embodiments, one of the width or depth is micro-scale, and the other is nano-scale. In some embodiments, each groove has the same width and depth. In some embodiments, the width and/or depth of at least one groove is different from at least one other groove. In some embodiments, the width and depth of each groove is constant across the entire length of the groove. In some embodiments, the width and/or depth of each groove may vary across at least a portion of the length of the groove.",
                        "Each groove may have a cross-sectional shape that may be the same or different from other grooves. In some embodiments, each groove has the same cross-sectional shape. In some embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of at least one groove is different from the cross-sectional shape of at least one other groove.",
                        "The grooves may have any cross-sectional shape. Referring to FIG. 2A, in some embodiments, a groove may have a rectangular cross-section (e.g., a \u201crectangular groove\u201d). The two sidewalls 200 of the groove are parallel and vertical (and may be, e.g., perpendicular to the most external surface 112). The bottom 205 of the groove is flat and perpendicular to the sidewalls (and may be, e.g., parallel to the most external surface 112).",

                        "In some embodiments, a groove may have no flat bottom. For example, referring to FIG. 2C, in some embodiments, a groove may have a \u201cU\u201d shape 220, with generally parallel vertical sidewalls. Referring to FIG. 2D, in some embodiments, a groove may have a \u201cV\u201d shape 230, with non-parallel sidewalls.",

In some embodiments, every groove may be parallel to every other groove. In some embodiments, a minimum distance 117 between every groove and an adjacent groove is identical. In some embodiments, the minimum distance between at least one groove and an adjacent groove is different from the minimum distance between a different groove and its adjacent groove. In some embodiments, the minimum distance between one groove and an adjacent groove may be constant for the entire length of the groove. In some embodiments, the minimum distance between one groove and an adjacent groove may vary for at least a portion of the entire length of the groove.",
                        "In some embodiments, the grooves may be straight. In some embodiments, the grooves may include one or more curves. Referring to FIG. 4, in some embodiments, the grooves 111 may be disposed in a seemingly random fashion. For example, in some embodiments, the grooves may form a random or pseudo-random pattern. As used herein, the term \u201cpseudo-random\u201d refers to something generated or obtained using a finite, nonrandom computational process. In other words, pseudo-random values refer a set of values that is statistically random but is derived from a known starting point. Pseudorandom sequences may, therefore, exhibit statistical randomness while being generated by an entirely deterministic causal process.",
                        "The substrate is comprised of a rigid or semi-rigid material. As used herein, the term \u201csemi-rigid\u201d describes a shape or configuration of a material that allows limited deformation under moderate stresses and strains but exhibits a restoring force that effects an inherent resiliency, i.e., a tendency to return to its original shape or configuration when the stresses or strains are removed.",

                        "In some embodiments, the infusing liquid may be a nanofluid. As used herein, the term nanofluid refers to a fluid that contains particles having a size in nanometer scale (e.g., 100 nm or less), such as nanodiamond particles, graphene-oxide, or the composite formed of those particles. The nanofluid may also contain a fluid, particularly a liquid fluid within which the particles are dispersed.",

                        "First, the velocity inside the grooves should be such that the Peclet number within it is above 1. This implies that the velocity must be greater than the thermal diffusivity of the liquid in the cavity divided by the length scale of the cavity.",
                        "Second, the thermal conductivity of the solid (e.g., substrate) should be on the order of (or less) than the thermal conductivity of the liquid in the cavity. That is, in some embodiments, the thermal conductivity of the solid may be less than the thermal conductivity of the infusing liquid.",

The infused liquid creates a dynamic interface that induces a slipping effect on the external flow while affecting wall-normal velocity fluctuations. The careful design of texture topology, liquid viscosity, thermal conductivity, and surface tension enables the precise tuning of transport processes.",
                                "Several efforts have used superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) to reduce friction while maintaining the benefits of reduced system size. Similar effects could be accomplished with LIS. An analytical model of heat transfer in pipes with SHS or LIS, taking the reduced friction into account, was recently developed. Indeed, reducing the pipe radius increased the advantage of using SHS and LIS. Some LIS and SHS models have been developed to attempt to increase heat transfer and decreased drag in direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow. Out of the investigated surface configurations, this occurred only for SHS with longitudinal grooves, dynamic interfaces, and gas-liquid thermal conductivity ratio one. The solid structures were also assumed to have a constant temperature. This thermal conductivity ratio and the isothermal textures are hard to realize in actual conditions, however.",
                                "If the thermal conductivity of the solid texture is similar to a contiguous liquid, the heat flux in neither phase is trivial. These solid-liquid combinations are not rare in applications. For example, water has a thermal conductivity that is higher than the polymer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). LIS made from such materials can be expected to have a very different heat flux compared to LIS with isothermal surface textures. For metal solids, liquid metals may be used as infused liquids. There has recently been an increase in liquid gallium alloys with low toxicity in stretchable electronics. The thermal conductivity of gallium is comparable to that of steel.",

An overview of some properties is given in Table 1, below.",
                                "Using liquid and solid properties similar to those of existing materials, this example illustrates how convection in the texture of LIS with transverse grooves can increase the surface heat flux, considering both laminar and turbulent flows. This mode of heat transfer has either been neglected or has not been evaluated previously. The study was performed by numerically solving the equations for the velocity and the temperature fields. The heat transfer mechanisms that are considered in this example are shown schematically in FIG. 6A. The convection by the mean flow of the working fluid was not considered, and the problem was simplified to the heat transport between two external boundaries of different temperatures.",

Values measured from the simulations with smooth walls were Nu0=5.8, 7.5, and 9.3 for Pr\u221e=1, 2, and 4, respectively. See Table 2. For flow over LIS assuming E=0, the ratio of the random convection to the total heat flux, qconv,r/q, does not change compared to the smooth-wall flow (eq. 5.2). Accordingly, qconv,r/q0 changes proportionally to q/q0. The conduction does not change with q/q0 because gcond=gcond0. The total heat flux increases when the solid wall is replaced with a LIS, i.e., q/q0>1, hence qconv,r/q0 increases but not qcond/q0. Since the heat transfer enhancement is (gconv,r+gconv,d+gcond)/q0, it is more significant than what only gconv,d would produce with gconv,r=qconv,r=0 (i.e., at Nu0=1). Indeed, this amplification is substantial, as seen from the values of Nu0. This effect can be expected to increase with increasing bulk Reynolds or Prandtl numbers; previous work has shown Nu0 increases linearly with Re\u03c4 for a channel with smooth isothermal walls.",

For Pr\u221e=1, E was somewhat lower, and for Pr\u221e=4 slightly higher (see Table 2). The positive values of E further enhance the heat flux, which is seen from the first form of the expression in eq. (5.3). This expression with E=0 is a lower limit of q/q0. Since the sum of E and gconv,d/q enters the equation, their magnitudes can be compared: qconv,d/q is 2.2, 3.1, and 4.4 times larger for Pr\u221e=1, 2, and 4, respectively.",

The root-mean-squared value, vrms+, is not reduced due to the presence of the interface but instead increases near the surface (see FIG. 13A). It is the varying slip-no slip condition at y=0, acting like roughness, that causes this. The increase of vrms+, also amplifies the production of vT+ above the surface. The effects from the change in the turbulence on DR are known to be generally severe for transverse grooves. The current DR and the ideal drag reduction relationship by Rastegari & Akhavan (2015) are shown in FIG. 13B. This relationship was derived for channels with symmetric walls but can also be applied to asymmetric configurations if DR is computed by eq. (5.1). Without roughness effects, it predicts that the drag reduction would be 8%. Nevertheless, this example achieves DR>0 together with a heat transfer increase for this geometry.",
                                "The heat transfer efficiency of the system can be measured by the heat flux to drag ratio or, equally, the Reynolds analogy factor, 2St/Cf, where St is the Stanton number and Cf is the friction coefficient. According to the Reynolds analogy, 2St/Cf=1 for flow over smooth walls with Pr\u221e=1. Changes in the heat flux to drag ratio when introducing surface modifications at this Prandtl number thus indicate a breakage of the Reynolds analogy. A growth or a reduction equal increased or decreased heat transfer efficiency, respectively. However, the exact value of 2St/Cf for smooth-wall flows depends on the normalization used to form the non-dimensional numbers. The heat flux to drag ratio normalized with the smooth wall reference values, (q/q0)(\u03c40/\u03c4), is a valid measure of the heat transfer efficiency independently of the Prandtl number. This quantity is reported in Table 2. Since both q/q0>1 and \u03c40/\u03c4>1 for the current setup, (q/q0)(\u03c40/\u03c4) exceeds unity, having a maximum value of 1.17 for Pr\u221e=4.

Thus, conventional techniques include surfaces that is designed to increase heat transfer, but result in increased fluid friction, and thus requires higher energy input (for example the pumping power needed to operate a heat exchanger). The disclosed approach is a design that increases heat transfer without increasing fluid friction, or with only minimal increase. The approach disclosed herein infuses (or lubricates, impregnates) the surface with a liquid that is held in place by grooves or cavities.
