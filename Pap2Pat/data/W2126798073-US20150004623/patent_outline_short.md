# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- introduce diagnostic method for acute leptospirosis

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- describe leptospirosis disease
- discuss transmission of Leptospira
- outline symptoms of leptospirosis
- describe limitations of current diagnostic tests
- introduce lateral flow tests (LFT)
- explain immunological assays
- discuss importance of early detection
- highlight need for improved diagnostic test
- describe current diagnostic methods
- discuss limitations of current diagnostic methods
- summarize need for improved diagnostic test

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### Example 1

- prepare antiserum to LipL21
- purify IgG from rabbit polyclonal antibody serum
- localize LipL21 via detection of anti-rLipL21 IgG

### Example 2

- develop lateral flow test strips
- optimize conjugation between anti-rLipL21 IgG antibody and colloidal gold

### Example 3

- use of the LFT strip

### Example 4

- optimize the LFT strip

### Example 5

- evaluate LFT strips with infected hamster model
- compare LFT strips with Leptospira isolation and PCR
- determine sensitivity and specificity of LFT strips
- discuss advantages of LFT strips over other diagnostic methods
- note patent application requirements
