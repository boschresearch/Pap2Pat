                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Leptospirosis or Weil's Disease is a bacterial infection caused by Leptospira, which is pathogenic for a wide range of animal species including humans. The pathogen was discovered for the first time in 1886 by Adolf Weil who reported an acute infection with enlargement of spleen, jaundice and nephritis. It occurs in the western countries, like the United States and Canada, specifically in dogs, as well as in tropical countries, for example in Asia. Incident rates range in temperate countries from 0.02 per 100,000 to 10 to 100 in 100,000 in warm/tropical countries. Leptospirosis outbreaks were observed during the wet and warm months in the year, particularly during the monsoon season.",
                        "The Leptospira organism is transmitted through the urine of an infected animal. The most important primary host of the pathogen are rodents, particularly mice and rats, however, there are also a wide range of animals that are able to carry and transmit the disease. Humans get infected mainly from their pets or when working in close proximity to infected animals, like for example in slaughterhouse. The route of infection in humans is mainly through contact with contaminated water, food or soil.",
                        "Usually the disease symptoms begin with typical signs of flu, like fever, chills and headache. When this first phase of the disease resolves, the patient is for a short period of time asymptomatic until the second phase of the disease begins. The second phase is characterized by meningitis, liver damage and renal failure, and can induce severe damage when left untreated. Symptoms in humans usually occur in Day 4 to 14 following infection. Because of this wide range of different symptoms, the disease is often misdiagnosed. Thus, recorded cases of Leptospira infection are estimated to be below the actual incident rate.",
                        "Leptospirosis is confirmed with serological tests such as the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the serological techniques that are used in detecting leptospiral antibodies are very tedious, time consuming and often neither specific nor sensitive. The serological results were difficult to interpret and making them unsuitable for routine testing particularly on large number of samples. These serological methods detect either IgM or IgG antibodies to Leptospira.",
                        "The detection of leptospires in the form of culture isolation is also not preferable due to the slow growth of the bacterium and therefore provides a limited use in laboratory investigation. Nizamuddin et. al., (2006) suggested that antigen detection is useful in the diagnosis of acute cases of leptospirosis. However, to date, no diagnostic kit is available to detect antigen(s) in acute leptospiremia, specifically not during the first week of infection.",
                        "Available diagnostic tests, which are based on the use of the whole leptospiral cell extracts or semi purified fractions of proteins of the native non-infective form, can detect antibodies against leptospirosis with increased sensitivity and specificity in the late acute phase (Eller et al., 2002).",
                        "Lateral flow tests (LFT), also known as Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assays are simple diagnostic test devices used to detect the presence (or absence) of a target analyte, e.g. a pathogen, in a sample. Most commonly, these tests are used in medicine to provide an easy diagnosis either for use in the clinic or in the laboratory. Often produced in a dipstick format or as a strip, the lateral flow tests are a form of immuno-based assays in which the test sample moves along a solid substrate via capillary force.",
                        "After the sample is applied to the test it encounters a coloured reagent which mixes with the sample and transits to the substrate encountering lines which have been pre-treated with an antibody or antigen. Depending upon the analyte's presence in the sample the coloured reagent can become bound at the test line. Lateral Flow Tests can operate as either competitive or sandwich assays.",
                        "The diagnostic techniques of immunological assays are mostly based on detecting the antibody or antigen using a variety of methods. Labelled-antigens or antibodies are playing a prominent role in many of the currently available diagnostic kits. The label may consist of an enzyme, colloidal gold, radioisotope or fluorescent probe. The extremely high selectivity and affinity of the host antibody molecules to specific antigens have widely been used for immune detection methods. IgM antibody-based immune assays are used for early detection of many infectious diseases. However, serious infectious diseases like leptospirosis could kill the infected subject before the host could muster a significant immune response and produces enough antibodies to allow detection in the diagnostic method.",
                        "In view of the available diagnostic assays for leptospirosis it was the objective of the present invention to provide an improved diagnostic test system which allows for an easy, rapid and specific detection of the pathogenic Leptospira organisms. Specifically, the objective of the invention was to provide a diagnostic test that allows for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in the very early stage of infection, specifically in the first 10 days, or even within the first 1 to 4 days of infection.",
                        "The above problem is solved in a first aspect by a method for the detection of the presence of Leptospira in a sample, comprising the steps of",
                        "a) providing a sample to be analyzed,\n\nb) detecting the presence of LipL21 antigen in the said sample,\n\nc) optionally, detecting the presence of LipL21 antigen in a control sample,\n\nwherein the presence of LipL21 in the said sample is indicative for the presence of Leptospira.",
                        "In the context of the present invention a sample usable in the methods and devices described herein is a sample from a subject suspected to suffer from a Leptospira infection. Such a sample is preferably a biopsy, preferably a kidney biopsy, or a liquid sample, preferably selected from the group comprising urine, blood, serum or blood plasma. However, the present invention shall not be restricted to this exemplary listing of types of samples.",
                        "In a further embodiment of the invention the subject suspected to suffer from a Leptospira infection could be a bird, amphibian, reptile or mammal, preferably wherein the mammal is a rodent or a human. Most preferred samples for the methods of the invention are samples which originate from humans.",
                        "Preferably LipL21 is detected in step b) of the present invention by immunological means, such as the use of an antibody specific for the LipL21 protein. LipL21 is an outer membrane protein of pathogenic leptospires. It plays an important role in the infection process by acting as an adhesin, or as a target of specific antibodies, as porins, and as a receptor for soluble molecules and complement proteins. For the present invention, other leptospiral specific proteins can be used and are encompassed, for example LipL32.",
                        "Yet one additional preferred embodiment of the invention relates to antibodies for the detection of leptospires. Specifically it is preferred that the antibody is a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody, preferably wherein the antibody is a rabbit polyclonal antibody.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment of the invention the detection in step b) in the above method is performed using a lateral flow test (LFT), for example using a competitive or non-competitive LFT. In a competitive LFT assay, the sample first encounters detectable particles which are labelled with an analogue of the analyte. In context of the present invention, the preferred analyte is the leptospiral cell, or fragments thereof, or more specifically, the LipL21 protein. The sample then encounters a test line containing antibodies specific to the analyte, e.g. LipL21. Thus the unlabelled analyte in the sample and the detectably labelled analogue compete for binding with the immobilized antibodies in the test line. The antibody used for a competitive LFT within the test line is usually a monoclonal antibody. In competitive LFTs the test line (or capture line) will be detectable in the event that the sample is negative for the analyte.",
                        "In non-competitive LFTs there is no binding-competition between unlabelled and labelled analyte. In this embodiment the analyte is first labelled with a detectable particle and then is brought into contact with an antibody specific for the analyte at the test line. Thus, in a non competitive LFT a detectable test line is indicative for the presence of the analyte in the sample.",
                        "In a specific embodiment the test or control lines in the assay of the invention can be detected by eye observation. In this regard, the detectable particle is preferably a colloidal gold particle.",
                        "In context of the present invention it is preferred that the LFT is a non-competitive LFT. Preferably the LFT comprises a test line and/or a control line for confirming the correct operation of the LFT. Such a control line contains antibodies directed to the detection antibody in the LFT and is located distal to the test line. At the control line any detectable particle coupled to an detection antibody is immobilized. In this way it is confirmed that the LFT contained undamaged detection particles. A detectable control line therefore confirms correct operation of the LFT.",
                        "In a second aspect the object of the present invention is solved by a diagnostic device for detecting the presence of Leptospira in a sample. The diagnostic device comprises:\n\n\n- a) a sample addition zone,\n- b) a conjugation zone, comprising an antibody-indicator complex,\n- c) a detection zone, comprising a zone of immobilized detection\n  antibodies (capture line) and, optionally, a control zone of\n  immobilized control antibodies,\n- d) optionally, an absorbance zone for absorbing excess sample fluid.",
                        "According to one embodiment of the present invention, the diagnostic device comprises a sample addition zone, preferably in the form of a pad (sample pad) that allows the introduction of the sample to be analysed onto the diagnostic device. Usually the sample is a liquid sample which is added onto the sample pad in order to start the assay. The sample pad preferably is made of a material that allows for a movement of the sample fluid by capillary forces and which therefore transports the analyte in the sample through the zones of the inventive diagnostic device.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, the sample pad material is a non woven cotton fibre, like cellulose fibre. It is further preferred that the sample pad for the purpose of the present invention permits the release of the analyte by high efficiency. To this end, the sample pad of the present invention is pre-treated with salt buffer and a blocking agent, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). In the preferred embodiment of the invention the pre-treatment is carried out using 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1% (w/v) BSA, and subsequent drying at 60\u00b0 C. The sample pad is thereafter treated again with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 3% (w/v) sucrose and 0.02% sodium azide and dried at 37\u00b0 C.",
                        "The conjugation zone of the diagnostic device of the present invention has the function to allow the analyte to react with the antibody-indicator complex of the present invention. The conjugation zone is dried before usage of the diagnostic device. The structure of the antibody-indicator complex with respect to the present invention is described herein below in more detail. When running the assay, the analyte within the sample liquid moves by capillary forces from the sample addition zone to the conjugation zone, wherein the analyte is exposed to the antibody-indicator complex. If analyte is present in the sample, the analyte may bind to the antibody-indicator complex. In any case the antibody-indicator complex is mobilized by the liquid in the sample and transported by capillary forces from the conjugation zone to the detection zone.",
                        "Preferred in the context of the present invention is, that the conjugation zone is in form of a pad (conjugation pad). A preferred material for the conjugation pad is glass fibre, e.g. MilliporeGlass FiberConjugatePadswith Lot Number-92090602; 20\u00d7300 mm Millipore, Mass., USA. Like the sample pad, the conjugation pad is preferably pre-treated with salt buffers and blocking agent. In a specific embodiment the pre-treatment is as follows: The anti-rLipL21 antibody labeled colloidal gold conjugate (antibody-indicator complex, was diluted (1:1 v/v) with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) BSA, 6% (w/v) sucrose. The conjugate pad pre-treated with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 24 hrs and dried for 45 minutes at 60\u00b0 C. was immersed into conjugate solution, then lyophilized and store in a desiccator at 4\u00b0 C. until use.",
                        "The detection zone of the diagnostic device according to the invention contains in a preferred embodiment the test and optionally control zones which allow to detect the absence or presence of the analyte. In one preferred embodiment the detection zone is made of a material that allows the liquid sample to move by capillary forces and on which the detection or control antibodies can be immobilized. Preferably is the use of a nitrocellulose membrane. For the purpose of the present invention, the zone of immobilized detection antibodies (capture line or test line) and, optionally, the control zone of immobilized control antibodies (control line) is arranged such that the sample liquid while the assay is run moves via capillary forces through the detection and/or control zone. The detection and/or control zone may be formed in any convenient way, such as sports, lines or likewise shaped zones.",
                        "Preferred is that the detection and/or control zone are formed as lines which are placed distant to each other to allow to distinguish their respective signals.",
                        "The absorbance zone is in a preferred embodiment composed of high-density cellulose material to allow the take up of excess sample fluid during the assay.",

In this study, two rabbits were immunized using 100 \u03bcg of purified rLipL21. Purified rLipL21 protein was loaded onto SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and allowed to migrate into the separating gel during electrophoresis. An rLipL21 containing band was excised from the gel and desiccated. Desiccated gel containing recombinant protein were ground to a powder, dissolved in 1 ml of water and mixed with 1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant (Merck, USA). (Merck). Pre-immune serum was collected before immunization and used as a control in neutralization experiments. The mixture of rLipL21 and complete adjuvant were injected both subcutaneously and intramuscularly on Day 1 into leptospiral antibodies free New Zealand White rabbits. Additional immunizations with the same dosage of the rLipL21 with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Merck) were done on Day 15 and Day 29. On Day 36 the rabbits were bled by heart puncture and the serum was collected to detect antibodies against LipL21. The LipL21-antiserum was stored in small aliquots at \u221220\u00b0 C. until use. Animals were housed in accordance with the ethical principles and experimental procedures with animals were approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University Putra Malaysia (AUP No: 09R57/Mac 09-Feb10).",
                                "Purification of IgG from Rabbit Polyclonal Antibody Serum",
                                "These methods effectively purify the main classes of antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA). A protocol for affinity chromatography purification of polyclonal antibodies with immunoglobulin class is also provided. However the ion-exchange chromatography is indicated for purifying intact monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and antibody fragments from different sources. IgG purification from whole serum by using ammonium sulfate precipitation effectively removes other protein contaminations, but they still contain both the specific (to the desired antigen) and non-specific IgG molecules. These nonspecific contaminations can be removed by size-exclusion or ion exchange chromatography. Instead, Protein A, protein G or one of the newer commercial proprietary affinity chromatography columns can be used (Grodzki and Berenstein, 2010).",
                                "To obtain polyclonal purified immunoglobulin, whole serum supernatant was used in Montage Antibody Purification Kits with PROSEP-A (LSK2 ABA 20, Millipore). A schematic representation of the anti-body generation is found in FIG. 1. Immunized rabbit antiserum containing, IgG were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions to Brief, The PROSEP-A media was Pre equilibrated with 10 ml Binding Buffer A by centrifuged the spin column at 500\u00d7g for 5 minutes. The serum sample to be loaded to the spin column was prefiltered through a 0.22 \u03bcm Steriflip-GP device to remove any debris immediately before loading the sample. The filtered serum sample was diluted with 1:1 v/v in Binding Buffer A. (For example, 10 ml filtered sample was added to 10 ml binding buffer) 20 ml of the sample was allowed to flow through the spin column. The column was spun at 150\u00d7g for 20 minutes, unbound contaminants were removed by adding 10 ml Binding Buffer A and the spin column was spun for 2 minutes at 500\u00d7g. Above wash procedure was carried out once again. The unbound wash contained non-immunoglobulin components. Finally the rabbit IgG was eluted by adding 10 ml Elution Buffer B2 directly into a fresh centrifuge tube containing 1.3 ml Neutralization Buffer C to bring the sample to neutral pH, by spinning the column for 5 minutes at 500\u00d7g. The purified IgG was analyzed for the quality by SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. The total immunoglobulin was quantified spectrophotometrically, and ELISA was performed to confirmed reactivity of the IgG towards rLipL21 (FIG. 3). Two micrograms of purified IgG proteins was analyzed for reactivity against rLipL21 and leptospiral OMPs by Western blotting (FIG. 4). The purified IgG proteins were stored at \u221270\u00b0 C. for further analysis.",

                                "For the investigation of LipL21-localization in Leptospira spp, the leptospiral outer membrane was extracted by the nonionic detergent Triton X-114 phase separation. LipL21 protein was observed in the detergent phase, but not observed in soluble phase (FIG. 5). When 20 mM CaCl2 was added, LipL21 was exclusively in the detergent-phase. LipL21 was found to partition exclusively into the detergent phase. This is in contrast to the results of the immunoblot, where the anti-rLipL21 IgG reacted specifically to the protein having a size corresponding with the molecular mass predicted for LipL21 on detergent phase (FIG. 5). The detergent phase of leptospiral OMP interaction with anti-rLipL21 IgG indeed originated from interactions with leptospiral LipL21. No reactivity was evident at the membrane fractions from non-pathogenic strains.",
                                "**Specificity of Anti-rLipL21 IgG Against Leptospiral LipL21 in Immunoblot:**",
                                "The specificity of antibodies purified from antisera generated in rabbits was first evaluated by immunoblotting against the rLipL21 fusion protein. The purified anti-rLipL21 IgG showed high specificity to their corresponding recombinant antigens. The specificity of the antibodies against each individual leptospiral serovar protein was further evaluated by immunoblotting analyses of Triton X 114 fractionation-separated OMP (FIG. 5). Similarly, antiserum raised against rLipL21 in the rabbit was tested against leptospiral OMP fractions obtained by Triton X 114 method. More importantly, LipL21 from OMP detergent fractions were detected in the tested Leptospira strains by immunoblot, which could be observed at approximately predicted molecular weight 19.6 kDa (FIG. 6), and similarly the lipL21 gene of these strains could be detected by PCR amplification. Pre immune serum (prior to rabbit immunization with purified, recombinant protein) was tested and found not to be reactive with any leptospiral antigens. In immunoblotting analyses, the anti-rLipL21 detects LipL21 from pathogenic Leptospira spp without cross reactivity of particular importance was the fact that anti-rLipL21 IgG did not cross-react with the other bacterial antigens tested. This specificity reduces the possibility of a false positive result in diagnostic kit of the present invention.",
                                "Although the anti-rLipL21 IgG was detected from each of the LipL21 pathogenic Leptospira spp, the intensity of band differed between culture passages. Weak cross-reactions were observed with 3 strains of related serovars (Canicola, Pyrogenes and Grippotyphosa), demonstrating the specificity of the LipL21 antiserum (FIG. 6). LipL21 has strong sequence conservation as is observed in the lipL21 genes of Leptospira spp. The OMP separation used relatively the same amount of leptospiral pathogens for immunoblot. However, the present results of immunoblot showed the anti-rLipL21 IgG, detected a very strong band on the low passage (LP) of Leptospira spp and low intensity band with the high passage (HP) of Leptospira spp.",
                                "However, antibodies against rLipL21 proteins clearly detected leptospiral antigens with anti-rLipL21 being the most sensitive. The anti-rLipL21 IgG reacted very similarly with all pathogenic leptospiral OMP containing detergent fractions, but selectively detecting LipL21 indicating that they may have affinity to the same leptospiral epitope. The polyclonal antibodies can be highly sensitive but less specific then monoclonal antibodies while monoclonal antibodies can be highly specific with less sensitivity (Varma et. al., 2002). Usage of highly sensitive antibody like anti-rLipL21 IgG will give potentially good results in diagnostic kits."

In this rapid test, the colloidal gold particle (40 nm) was conjugated with anti-rLipL21 IgG. The conjugated antibody was directly absorbed on colloidal gold particle surface, mediated by London-Van der Waals force and hydrophobic interaction (Hermanson et al., 1992). Optimal concentration of antibody (0.08-0.1 mg/ml) for the conjugation with colloidal gold was determined by comparing the absorption between 520-580 nm (FIG. 7).",

Fifteen leptospirosis infected animal models and five uninfected animals as control were tested for the presence of the corresponding leptospires by Leptospira isolation and PCR using lipL21 gene specific primers. The absence of infection was also confirmed by Leptospira isolation.

In all 15 samples that showed positive reaction for Leptospira by LFT strips were also positive by blood culture was for leptospirosis. Furthermore, the Leptospira infection not detected by PCR, not all had low leptospiremia. The PCR application to blood samples has many potential drawbacks due to the susceptibility of PCR to inhibitors, contamination and experimental conditions. For instance, it is known that the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR assay is dependent on target genes, primer sequences, PCR techniques, DNA extraction procedures, and PCR product detection methods.",

LFT sensitivity decreased to 33.3% on the Day 5. The high sensitivity results were observed on Day 1-4 after infection of the hamster model. The high agreement between LFT and culture methods suggests that LFT strips can be particularly important in acute leptospirosis where there were clinical signs and symptoms but absence of antibodies (negative serological results), and thereby allowing early and rapid confirmation of the disease.",

Hence, the LFT strip can detect early leptospiral infection in hamsters. Notably, the positive rates of the detection of leptospires in this experimental model gradually declined with time. On Day 5 post infection, this may reflect specific antibody-mediated leptospires clearance to respond to the humoral immunity (Guerreiro et al., 2001).",
