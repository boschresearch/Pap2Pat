    "title": "Production and Characterization of a Polyclonal Antibody of Anti-rLipL21-IgG against<i>Leptospira</i>for Early Detection of Acute Leptospirosis",
    "date": "2014-01-01",
    "abstract": "Leptospirosis is one of the zoonotic diseases in animals and humans throughout the world. LipL21 is one of the important surface-exposed lipoproteins in leptospires and the most effective cross protective immunogenic antigen. It is widely considered as a diagnostic marker for leptospirosis. In this study, we evaluated the serodiagnostic potential of LipL21 protein of Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona. We have successfully amplified, cloned, and expressed LipL21 in E. coli and evaluated its specificity by immunoblotting. Purified recombinant LipL21 (rLipL21) was inoculated into rabbits for the production of polyclonal antibody. Characterization of the purified IgG antibody against rLipL21 was performed by cross reactivity assay. Only sera from leptospirosis patients and rabbit hyperimmune sera recognized rLipL21 while the nonleptospirosis control sera showed no reaction in immunoblotting. We confirmed that anti-rLipL21-IgG antibody cross reacted with and detected only pathogenic leptospiral species and it did not react with nonpathogenic leptospires and other bacterial species. Results observed showed that anti-rLipL21-IgG antibody has high specificity and sensitivity to leptospires. The findings indicated that the antibody could be used in a diagnostic assay for detection of leptospires or their proteins in the early phase of infection.",

                "Leptospirosis is a major public health concern and has now been identified as one of the emerging infectious diseases worldwide [1, 2]. It is highly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region [3]. In Malaysia, leptospiral infections seen in domestic animals were mainly due to serovars of the Sejroe and Pomona serogroups. The infections in humans were also due to Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona [4]. It is considered that the majority of leptospirosis cases in humans were due to association with animals and disease-infected environment [5]. Leptospirosis displays a wide array of clinical presentations and it is difficult to distinguish from dengue, malaria, and influenza. It mimics many other diseases characterized by fever, headache, and myalgia [6]. After clearance of leptospires from blood and body fluids, they are known to persist for prolonged periods in immune privileged sites like renal tubules, brain, and eyes of carrier animals [7]. Leptospires include 268 serovars [8] and can be organised into 31 serogroups on the basis of their antigenic relatedness [5]. The antigenic structure of leptospires is complex, with structural heterogeneity in the carbohydrate component of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [7]. The outer membrane of leptospires is composed of immunogenic LPS and different types of outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Lipopolysaccharides play a key role in immunity to infection and are responsible for serovar variations [9]. Based on serological classification, the genus Leptospira was earlier classified into two species, the pathogenic L. interrogans and nonpathogenic L. biflexa.",
                "The leptospiral membrane possesses at least three types of OMPs: lipoproteins, peripheral OMPs, and transmembrane proteins [10, 11]. Among them LipL21 was described as one of the most important outer membrane lipoproteins produced during leptospiral infection [12]. Detection and identification of conserved leptospiral lipoproteins among pathogenic leptospires were made through cross-protection assays against various serovars of leptospires. The exclusive presence of these proteins in the pathogenic leptospires indicated that they could be promising candidates for developing diagnostics [13]. Hence these lipoproteins have currently become a major focus of leptospirosis research [14].",
                "In the present study, we expressed the recombinant protein LipL21 and evaluated its immunogenic potential with leptospirosis human sera and rabbit hyperimmune sera. We used purified, recombinant LipL21 to create polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) against rLipL21. The results of the present study provide a possible new candidate for developing diagnostic kit for detecting leptospires and/or their leptospiral antigen during the early stages of infection."

                "Leptospirosis is an important public health disease in endemic areas all over the world. In Malaysia, continuous presence of multiple leptospires serovars is observed in competent reservoirs like rat and other animals, and a large population of susceptible hosts [4]. Humans and animals infected with leptospires mount strong and rapid antibody responses directed against the outer surface protein, LipL21. The presence of LipL21-directed antibodies in patient serum is a reliable marker of leptospiral infection. Lipoproteins are an important antigen and play a key role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis [14] and surface-exposed putative lipoproteins [21, 22]. Several lipoproteins and surface-exposed putative lipoproteins have been identified in Leptospira spp., which are associated with the outer membrane particularly those exposed on the cell surface where bacterial pathogens interact with the host [23]. These lipoproteins are maintaining the bacterial cell structure, attachment to various substrates, and immunogenicity [5]. Among these lipoproteins, the LipL21 protein has been well characterized in L. interrogans serovar Lai [24]. LipL21 has been reported to be conserved in pathogenic leptospiral strains and this has led to its use in PCR-based identification of Leptospira spp. [7]. In this study, a PCR assay was performed using lipL21 gene specific primers for detection of Leptospira spp. The expected size (573\u2009bp) of amplified lipL21 gene was seen in 11 pathogenic Leptospira strains but not observed in the nonpathogenic leptospiral strain (Figure 1). Similarly, the lipL21 gene specific primer did not amplify any other 10 bacterial strains (data not shown). The lipL21 gene specific primer would be useful for identification of pathogenic Leptospira spp. These PCR results corroborated well with previous reports that LipL21 is present only in pathogenic and absent in nonpathogenic strains [12, 25].",
                "Genomic analysis revealed that the identified LipL21 proteins of L. interrogans strain Pomona were found to be 97\u2013100% amino acids similar to other pathogenic Leptospira spp. An alignment of the LipL21 sequence from pathogenic Leptospira revealed 96% to 100% identity. They also did not have any significant similarity with the proteins of other organisms [26, 27]. However, insights from recent genome projects have shown that nonpathogenic strain of L. biflexa LipL21 protein is an ortholog with ~50% identity present in pathogenic leptospires [26]. Its exclusive presence in pathogenic leptospires indicated that this protein could be a good candidate in developing diagnostic kits [13].",
                "Generally, important diagnostic and vaccine markers primarily induce antibodies against surface structures. Molecular analysis of leptospiral OMP antigens is important in understanding the antibody response of hosts, because the antigenic diversity may influence the specificity and sensitivity of the serological assay. The conserved nature and high level of expression of LipL21 among pathogenic Leptospira spp. [7] suggest that rLipL21 immunoblot may show similar performance regardless of the local isolates. E. coli based expression system is now routinely used for the synthesis of recombinant proteins for a variety of purposes ranging from structural studies to the development of vaccines [11, 12, 19]. Similarly, the purification of recombinant protein is important to develop a detection system for infectious diseases. The present work adopted similar approach for expression of LipL21 protein and purification of rLipL21 in E. coli cells (Figure 2).",
                "Normally, E. coli based IPTG/NaCl induced expression system was used for the synthesis of recombinant lipoproteins from Leptospira spp. [28\u201330]. Drawback for the use of this system includes the requirement of expression conditions such as need to follow growth of bacterial culture and add IPTG/NaCl at the proper time. An advantage of the use of Overnight Auto Induction System 1 in the present study did not require any inducer including IPTG/NaCl.",
                "In this study, an immunoblot using the rLipL21 protein as an antigen was evaluated for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in humans. In this study, we evaluated the clinical utility and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity of recombinant LipL21 based immunoblot for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. The specificity of the antibody test (immunoblot) with a rLipL21 protein detected by clinically confirmed leptospirosis patient sera (Figure 3(b)). In order to confirm the similarity of the antigenic structure of the recombinant forms of the LipL21 protein, as well as to verify the cell wall localization of LipL21, we carried out a simple immunoblot study in which we tested the ability of the recombinant proteins to react with serum from a rabbit (Figure 3(b)). The strong reactivity of the recombinant forms of LipL21 with the patient serum confirms the information from studies carried out previously [12, 31]. Recombinant LipL21 was also reactive with this serum, meaning that LipL21 is immunogenic during leptospiral infection. This is probably because LipL21 protein is unique and highly conserved to pathogenic Leptospira spp. [12]. The specificity of LipL21 has been demonstrated to be strong immunogenic and could be an efficient tracer to LipL21 identification from Leptospira spp. Thus, use of the rLipL21 antigen in immunoblot has the potential to become a useful tool for serodiagnosis of leptospiral infection.",
                "Lipoproteins may be used as novel targets for the development of infection markers and leptospirosis vaccines [5]. In pathogenic Leptospira spp., LipL21 has been demonstrated to be a strong immunogen, which had been considered for vaccine development [12, 27, 29]. Together, these findings suggest that rLipL21 antigen is specific and sensitive for the detection of antibodies against leptospiral infection. Both rabbit and human anti-leptospiral antibodies were found to be strongly reactive with rLipL21. Additional immunoblot results showed that the rLipL21 had the advantage of high specificity and sensitivity to leptospirosis. The present study follows the strategy of previous studies on rLipL32, rOmpL1, rLipL41, and rLigA as target antibodies used for clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis [32\u201335].",
                "Although many of the cellular proteins were insoluble in the Triton X-114 or remained present in the aqueous phase, a limited number of proteins were present in the detergent phase, as previously described by Cullen et al. [12] and Haake et al. [28]. However, LipL21 protein was observed in the insoluble detergent phase and not observed in soluble phase [12]. Regardless of this, when we performed the converse study, the detergent fraction containing OMP antigen from Leptospira spp. and sera of immunized rabbit reacted against LipL21 antigen. Immunoblot of OMP fraction of Leptospira spp. using anti-rLipL21-IgG antibody revealed specificity of LipL21 antigen from pathogenic strains of leptospires (Figure 5). OMP fractions from the Leptospira spp. were LipL21 bound strongly detected by their anti-rLipL21-IgG antibodies. This result revealed that LipL21 is localized on the outer portion of the leptospires. This is the first demonstration of experimental characterization of the LipL21 from L. interrogans strain Pomona in Malaysia. Results from this study suggested that rLipL21 is a potential candidate for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of this antigen with a larger number of samples obtained during outbreaks of leptospirosis. The polyclonal serum against rLipL21 protein was more specific for differentiating the pathogenic organism from nonpathogenic leptospires. Apart from these, our work revealed that the use of anti-rLipL21-IgG antibodies increases the specificity of the antigen detection. From these results, we conclude that the use of purified recombinant protein based antibody production is an appropriate and applicable method for detection of acute leptospirosis.",
                "The polyclonal antibodies were highly sensitive but less specific in comparison to monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies on the other hand were highly specific but less sensitive [36]. These data could have useful application to detecting LipL21 antigen from leptospires infection."
