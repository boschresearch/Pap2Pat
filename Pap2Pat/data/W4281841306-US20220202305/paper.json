    "title": "Healing Field: Using Alternating Electric Fields to Prevent Cytokine Storm by Suppressing Clonal Expansion of the Activated Lymphocytes in the Blood Sample of the COVID-19 Patients",
    "date": "2022-06-02",
    "abstract": "In the case of the COVID-19 early diagnosis, numerous tech innovations have been introduced, and many are currently employed worldwide. But, all of the medical procedures for the treatment of this disease, up to now, are just limited to chemical drugs. All of the scientists believe that the major challenge toward the mortality of the COVID-19 patients is the out-of-control immune system activation and the subsequent cytokine production. During this process, the adaptive immune system is highly activated, and many of the lymphocytes start to clonally expand; hence many cytokines are also released. So, any attempt to harness this cytokine storm and calm down the immune outrage is appreciated. While the battleground for the immune hyperactivation is the lung ambient of the infected patients, the only medical treatment for suppressing the hypercytokinemia is based on the immunosuppressor drugs that systemically dampen the immunity with many unavoidable side effects. Here, we applied the alternating electric field to suppress the expansion of the highly activated lymphocytes, and by reducing the number of the renewed cells, the produced cytokines were also decreased. Applying this method to the blood of the COVID-19 patients in vitro showed \u223c33% reduction in the average concentration of the three main cytokines after 4 days of stimulation. This method could carefully be utilized to locally suppress the hyperactivated immune cells in the lung of the COVID-19 patients without any need for systemic suppression of the immune system by the chemical drugs.",

                "More than 200 million infections with at least four million mortalities (World Health Organization, 2021) worldwide are just a small part of the consequences that a 100\u00a0nm coronavirus (Zhu et al., 2020) has imposed on the world community since its emergence in China in 2019 (Phelan et al., 2020). After infection and commencement of the disease\u2019s immunological phase, many clinical manifestations would arise, but acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most lethal feature of the COVID-19 (Gibson et al., 2020; Ragab et al., 2020). Numerous pieces of evidence suggest that the severity of the disease and ARDS is highly correlated with the proinflammatory cytokine levels in the bloodstream and the intensity of the immune cell hyperactivation caused by the virus (Mangalmurti and Hunter, 2020; Mehta et al., 2020; Vaninov, 2020; Khayamian et al., 2021).",
                "Out-of-control secretion of cytokine proteins with subsequent immune system hyper-activation causes severe systemic damages to the tissues and organs throughout the body, such as pulmonary dysfunction and renal failure (Bhaskar et al., 2020; Rabb, 2020; Sun et al., 2020). To prevent exacerbation and progression of the disease in such patients, a broad range of immunosuppressor drugs such as corticosteroids, JAK inhibitors, etc., are used as a general treatment (Abdin et al., 2020; Kolilekas et al., 2020; Sharun et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021). For instance, dexamethasone therapy has shown promising results in reducing the severity of the infection and suppressing cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammation phase of the disease (Chen et al., 2006; Lammers et al., 2020; Group et al., 2021; Noreen et al., 2021). One major effect of the immunosuppressor drugs such as dexamethasone is their antiproliferative effect. In fact, dexamethasone impairs the proliferation of the lymphocytes such as T cells during their clonal expansion (Creed et al., 2009; Ma\u015blanka, 2013; Ma\u015blanka and Jaroszewski, 2013; Giles et al., 2018). Although many benefits are associated with the administration of dexamethasone for suppression of severe inflammations, many serious side effects (Alessi et al., 2020; Langarizadeh et al., 2021), such as the increased risk of sepsis (Bendel et al., 2002; Pera et al., 2002), calcium metabolism (Caniggia et al., 1981; Kusuda et al., 2019), kidney disorders (McKay and Cidlowski, 2003; de Vries et al., 2010), etc., (Russell et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2021), are also inevitable.",
                "Cytokines, as the signaling proteins and mediators of the immune response to the inflammation, are secreted by a variety of the cells, including lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, etc., among which T cell lymphocytes are the dominant agents that level up the released cytokines in the bloodstream (Zhang and An, 2007). Part of the cytokine secretion by the lymphocytes is attributed to their clonal expansion, a phenomenon by which activated lymphocytes produce more of themselves through mitosis division with the same antigen against a specific pathogen (Condotta and Richer, 2017; Adams et al., 2020; Gutierrez et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020). Hence, controlling such mitosis would be of interest in the suppression of immune hyperactivation in COVID-19 patients.",
                "Alternating electric field (AEF) therapy, mostly called tumor-treating fields (TTF), is a safe treatment of highly proliferative cancer cells by delivering the low intensity and intermediate frequency electric field (Carrieri et al., 1991; Hottinger et al., 2016). The method disrupts the mitotic spindle assembly of the dividing cells (Kirson et al., 2007). The abnormally divided cells with prolonged mitosis phase (during their cell cycle) finally undergo apoptosis. Since the AEF has an antimitotic mechanism, the most affected cells are highly proliferative ones, such as rapid growing cancer cells, while the healthy cells with a low division rate are not damaged during this stimulation (Kirson et al., 2004; Giladi et al., 2015).",
                "On this basis, AEF could safely be applied for each patient to suppress the highly activated and expanding lymphocytes and consequently reduce the amount of the released cytokines into the blood. As previously mentioned, such a procedure is currently implemented using the systemic administration of the immunosuppressor drugs that debilitate the entire immune system (Mehta et al., 2020). AEF stimulation just impacts the highly expanding lymphocytes in the lung ambient without any effect on the other immune cells, contrary to the immunosuppressor drugs that impair all of the immune cells.",
                "Here, we investigated the possibility of using the AEF modality to suppress the clonal expansion of highly activated and proliferative lymphocytes and the consequent reduction in the cytokines released by these cells, suitable as an anti-inflammation technique for COVID-19 patients. For this purpose, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors, followed by artificially being activated using the lymphocyte expansion kits. Then, the effect of the AEF on suppressing the expansion of the lymphocytes was evaluated by time-lapse imaging, viability, and apoptosis assays as well as flow cytometry technique. Moreover, the amount of three major cytokines (TNF-alpha, INF- gamma, IL-6) after AEF stimulation was also measured using the ELISA method. Then, the proposed method was verified by in vitro stimulating the WBCs derived from the COVID-19 patients with severe inflammation and cytokine storm. Based on the results, an average of \u223c33% in cytokine reduction was achieved after 1\u00a0week of AEF stimulation on the immune cells of the blood. In the case of artificially activated immune cells by lymphocyte expansion kits, this number was about \u223c26%. We believe that the proposed electrical method with promising results by local suppression of the cytokine storm could be a safe substitute for the immunosuppressor drugs with their systemic effects."

This outcome corroborates that both AEF and Dexamethasone have a similar function in suppressing the mitosis process of the activated lymphocytes.",

During these 5\u00a0days, the clonal expansion clusters of immune cells were formed Figure 2E. Then, cluster size and their abundance were imaged and analyzed after 48\u00a0h of AEF treatment. Contrary to the continuous growth of cell clusters in the cohort of activated PBMC, the proliferation and expansion of the activated PBMC were strongly suppressed by the AEF stimulation. As presented in Figures 2F,G, the average cluster size shows an increase of about \u223c81% after 48\u00a0h for the non-AEF treated group, while the growth of clusters in the electrically stimulated group has been dropped to \u223c \u221231%. These results confirm that the suppressive effect of AEF stimulation, which had been confirmed on the proliferative cancer cells (Giladi et al., 2015; Kessler et al., 2018), is also applicable for the expanding activated lymphocytes."

                        "AO/PI staining as well as apoptosis assay by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry technique was carried out to find the correlation between the cellular viability and the size reduction of the treated clusters. For more clarification, the viability and apoptosis assays were performed separately on lymphocytes, including B and T cells. Based on the image analysis, all of the two WBC subsets after AEF stimulation show a noticeable increase in the expression of the PI dye, which is an indicator of the membrane rupture and cell death (Khayamian et al., 2018) (Figures 3A,B). No PI uptake could be tracked in the control groups representing the viability of the cells. In harmony with the results of the AO/PI, flow cytometry results also show a significant reduction in the fraction of the live cells for the AEF treated group in which most of the cells entered into the early and late apoptosis phase (Figures 3C,D). As presented in Figure 3D, it is noteworthy to say that the necrosis portion of the cells is roughly the same before and after the electric field treatment. This phenomenon corroborates the non-necrosis induction of AEF on the expanding immune cells because based on the AEF mechanism, the cells undergo apoptosis, and sudden death or necrosis does not happen.",
                        "In the next step of the study, the effect of the AEF on the non-activated white blood cells was evaluated by live/dead staining and apoptosis assay. There is no sign of the cell clustering on the CTRL group since the cells are intact and no activating kit was used (Figure 3E). As presented in Figure 3E, no PI uptake could be traced in the CTRL WBCs before or after the electrical stimulation. This evidence corroborates the fact that the AEF only impacts the proliferative cells. In harmony with the AO/PI assay, the results of the Annexin V/PI test also show no apoptosis in the non-activated immune cells (Figure 3F) after 48\u00a0h of AEF treatment. The trajectory of the WBCs (Figures 3G,H) as well as their displacement and velocity (Ghaderinia et al., 2021) were also analyzed for non-activated WBCs in the presence and absence of AEF. As shown in Figures 3I,J, no difference could be inferred in their natural moving behavior. For further clarification, the effect of the electric field on the invasive function of the WBCs toward pathological threats was assessed. Time-lapse imaging (Figure 3K) was utilized to inspect the interaction of the WBCs with the foreigner MDA-MB-231 cells. Due to the HLA mismatch between the MDA-MB-231 cells and the donor WBCs, it is supposed that the cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), as well as natural killer cells (NK cells), are activated and invade the cells (Figure 3L) (Mart\u00ednez-Lostao et al., 2015; Shenouda et al., 2017; Cerignoli et al., 2018). Based on the results, there is no significant alteration in the number of attacks by the immune cells to the MDA-MB-231 cells, which corroborates the safety of the AEF on the normal function of the immune cells (Figure 3M)."

                        "Flow cytometry technique was employed to investigate the detailed effect of alternating electric field on each subset of the lymphocytes. For this purpose, both of the B and T cell activation and expansion kits were simultaneously applied to the blood of a healthy donor. The cells (after 5\u00a0days) were then treated with the AEF stimulation for 4\u00a0days, and the number of CD8 and CD4 positive cells (T cell markers) and CD19 cells (B cell marker) were counted by the flow cytometer. The results were compared with the activated but non-AEF treated cells as the control group. Based on the results (Figures 4A,B), the population of all pre-activated lymphocyte subsets was drastically reduced after the AEF treatment (Figure 4C). For instance, the T lymphocytes, including CD8+ and CD4+ cells, have lost about \u223c80% of their population after AEF stimulation and this fraction for B cells is about \u223c40% (Figure 4D). The results are in harmony with the expectation that the proliferation of the expanding cells was suppressed by the AEF stimulation. When the activated cells lose their ability to expand and are arrested in the mitosis phase of their cell cycle due to an abnormal division, they enter the apoptosis phase. Therefore, the number of cells in the AEF treated group becomes lower than the control activated and expanding cells. Moreover, T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, are more affected by the electric field treatment. This is due to the fact that T cells expand faster than the B cells, and as a result, the AEF stimulation has more suppressing impact on their division."

                        "Finally, the cytokine production by the immune cells was studied in both groups of activated control and AEF-treated cells. The cells at first were activated for 5\u00a0days, and then the experiment was carried out for all of the groups. In the activated PBMC + AEF group, the cells were under AEF stimulation for about 4\u00a0days. During these 4\u00a0days, the non-AEF treated group was just kept in an incubator. At the end of the experiment, the solution medium of both groups was collected and analyzed by the ELISA method.",
                        "Although many cytokines are produced and play functional roles in the post-activated immune cells, there are three main cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 that are produced by the lymphocytes and play the main role especially in the COVID-19 disease (Chen et al., 2020; Lammers et al., 2020; McGonagle et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020). Based on the results, all three major cytokines have shown a considerable reduction after 4\u00a0days of the electric field stimulation (Figures 4E,F). As presented in Figure 4G, the most cytokine reduction was attributed to the IFN-\u03b3 with \u223c40% and the least for the IL-6 with \u223c16% (\u223c25% for TNF-\u03b1). We extremely believe that this decrease is associated with the reduced number of immune cells after the suppression of their proliferation by the AEF. Hence, the number of the clusters, as well as their size, was assessed for the two groups at the end of the study. As shown in Figures 4H,I and in harmony with the results of the cytokine profiling, a reductive trend could be observed in the case of cluster size and abundance by 32 and 26% (Figure 4G), respectively."

                        "Human blood samples were collected from the five patients with COVID-19 disease to assess the efficacy of the alternating electric field on suppressing the activation and expansion of immune cells and the consequent reduction in cytokine production. The patients had not received any medication prior to blood sampling. After blood sampling and isolation of the WBCs, the cells were divided into two cohorts of control (without electrical treatment) and the group of electrically stimulated cells. Both groups were under study for 4\u00a0days.",
                        "The time-lapse imaging from the samples of the patients reveals that the lymphocyte clusters are formed (Figure 5A) in the samples of the patients due to cytokine storm. The size of the produced clusters was analyzed after AEF stimulation, and similar to the previous results, the electrical stimulation halted the growth of the clusters in the blood sample of each patient (Figure 5B), and also their average number was also decreased by \u223c30% (Figure 5C).",
                        "As presented in Figures 5D,G, all of the three major cytokines in the blood sample of all five patients were reduced after 4\u00a0days of AEF stimulation, even though the amount of reduction is different for each patient. Also, a major difference in concentration of the all of the three inflammatory cytokines could be observed compared to their initial values (Figure 5H). Figure 5I displays the average amount of cytokine reduction after electric field treatment of the patients\u2019 PBMCs. Based on the results, the most cytokine reduction is related to the IFN-\u03b3 by \u223c51%, while this number for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 is \u223c29 and \u223c19%, respectively.",
                        "Similar to the previous results obtained by the AEF treatment of the artificially activated PBMCs, we hypothesize that the decrease in the production of the cytokines in the samples of the COVID-19 patients is due to the suppressed clonal expansion of the lymphocytes. In fact, when the lymphocytes are confronted with the SARS-CoV-2 virus antigens, they become activated and then start to expand (Gutierrez et al., 2020). But here, we have suppressed their proliferation by the AEF method as a substitute to the prevalent immunosuppressor drugs such a dexamethasone."

                "The most challenge attributed to the positive COVID-19 cases that puts the lives of the patients in danger is the hyperactivation of the immune cells and their consequent high cytokine releasement into the bloodstream or the so-called cytokine storm (Huang et al., 2020; Pearce et al., 2020). Currently, the typical remedy for harnessing such an imposed lethal storm is using immunosuppressor drugs, e.g., dexamethasone, which entirely damps the immune system in the body. Although immunosuppressors subside the hyperactivation of the immune system, their various and serious side effects have always been a challenge and limited their prescription. Hence, any other safe and effective treatment that controls cytokine production with less or no side effects is highly appreciated.",
                "Since part of the cytokine storm in the COVID-19 disease is due to the hyperactivation of the lymphocytes and their uncontrolled growth, We, for the first time, have introduced AEF (a known procedure in brain tumor treatment (Fabian et al., 2019)) on electrical stimulation of the lymphocytes to suppress their clonal expansion (Figure 2). Subsequently, the cytokine storm is also reduced due to the reduction of the number of cytokine-producing cells (Figure 4 and Figure 5).",
                "Based on the obtained results (Figure 3), the AEF method had no harmful effects on the viability and function of the non-expanding and non-activated immune cells and other blood cells. The electrical stimulation just perturbs the expansion of the highly proliferating lymphocytes formed as a cluster. This suppression in lymphocyte expansion is followed by a noticeable reduction in the amount of the produced cytokines.",
                "We believe that this method can safely take the place of the current immunosuppressor drugs such as dexamethasone, which is regularly used for cytokine storm treatment that represses the whole immune system all over the body with severe side effects. In the future trend, the electric field could safely be delivered to the lung of the patients to locally suppress the highly proliferating cytokine-producing lymphocytes as a complementary method."
