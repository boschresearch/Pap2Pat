    "title": "An Intention-Driven Semi-autonomous Intelligent Robotic System for Drinking",
    "date": "2017-09-08",
    "abstract": "In this study, an intention-driven semi-autonomous intelligent robotic (ID-SIR) system is designed and developed to assist the severely disabled patients to live independently. The system mainly consists of a noninvasive brain machine interface (BMI) subsystem, a robot manipulator and a visual detection and localization subsystem. Different from most of the existing systems remotely controlled by joystick, head- or eye-tracking, the proposed ID-SIR system directly acquires the intention from users' brain. Compared with the state-of-art system only working for a specific object in a fixed place, the designed ID-SIR system can grasp any desired object in a random place chosen by a user and deliver it to his/her mouth automatically. As one of the main advantages of the ID-SIR system, the patient is only required to send one intention command for one drinking task and the autonomous robot would finish the rest of specific controlling tasks, which greatly reduces the burden of patients. Eight healthy subjects attended our experiment, which contained 10 tasks for each subject. In each task, the proposed ID-SIR system delivered the desired beverage container to the mouth of the subject and then put it back to the original position. The mean accuracy of the eight subjects was $97.5%$, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the ID-SIR system.",

In order to assist the patients to live independently, intelligent robotics technology is an attractive solution (Hochberg et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015; He et al., 2016).",
                "With less burden during the task execution period, it is a challenging work to accurately and real-time obtain the intentions of patients, locate the desired object, and efficiently control the robot manipulator to grasp the object and deliver it to the user. Evidently, intention obtaining approach, robot control, and object perception are three key points."

                        "Brain\u2013machine interface (BMI) technology is one of the favored solutions, as it can decode directly the users\u2019 intentions in terms of their brain signals without nervous peripherals. In 1999, some researchers applied the invasive BMI to train rats to control a robot arm (Chapin et al., 1999). In 2011, Kim et al. (2011) used the microelectrode array signals to control a point-and-click cursor, which made it possible for patients with tetraplegic to use the computer. Later, as a representative work, Hochberg et al. (2012) proposed an invasive BMI technology based on the microelectrode array signals, allowing two patients with long-standing tetraplegia to control a robotic arm for drinking. Even though the invasive BMI is a good solution, it needs an operation on users in advance. The patients may suffer from the expensive craniotomy and additional risks, such as infections and side effects from operations. Therefore, atraumatic non-invasive BMI technology is a better choice for most people.",
                        "As Onose et al. pointed out, EEG is the only realistically practical non-invasive BMI approach at present among the existing non-invasive BMI technologies, because it is relatively affordable and easy to set-up (Onose et al., 2012; Ferracuti et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013, 2016; Yu et al., 2013). Other non-invasive BMI technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imagery, magneto-encephalography, and positron emission tomography, are quite expensive and not portable in terms of the size and electrical energy usage (Onose et al., 2012). Therefore, a number of EEG-based BMI paradigms and systems are exploited and developed in recent years (Schr\u00f6er et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Active/voluntary paradigm (e.g., Motor imagery, for short as MI) and passive paradigm (e.g., P300 and steady-state evoked potentials, for short as SSVEP) are two basic strategies for the interaction between users and computers. Although some researchers employed the MI-BMI to control a robot arm to perform a task of picking and placing (Wang et al., 2015), the disadvantages are inherent and difficult to accept, such as less control options, more preliminary training, low accuracy, and instability (Li and Yu, 2015). By contrast, P300 evoked potential is more suitable to detect users\u2019 intention. It has been verified that the P300 allows very high accuracy and more optional orders with little training time (less than 5\u2009min), which is essential in practical applications (Prezmarcos et al., 2011; Li and Yu, 2015). In addition, P300-BMI systems do not require subjects to learn how to modulate their EEG, and the P300-BMI was about two times faster than the equivalent Mi-BMI systems (Prezmarcos et al., 2011). A comparison research between P300-BMI system and SSVEP-BMI system has also proved that P300-BMI is more robust for subjects, though SSVEP-BMI has higher bit rate (Lijing et al., 2012). Moreover, the SSVEP-BMI needs to flash consistently in real time to obtain the corresponding signals, which is more tiresome for users. Considering the safety, robustness and less burden, P300-BMI system is more suitable and applied in the ID-SIR system.",
                        "In order to improve the accuracy and information transmission rate, efficient classification algorithms are necessary. Among numerous P300-BMI applications, support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) have been used to achieve acceptable results (Lenhardt et al., 2008; Schr\u00f6er et al., 2015; Simbolon et al., 2015). As pointed out in Lenhardt et al. (2008), compared with other complex classifiers such as SVM, LDA was capable due to its good classification performance as well as low computational and training requirements. Hoffmann et al. successfully applied the LDA to obtain high classification accuracies and bit rates for severely disabled subjects (Hoffmann et al., 2008). Different from most existing LDA-P300 systems with a fixed training-round number (Townsend et al., 2010; Akram et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016), a self-adaptive Bayesian linear discriminant analysis algorithm is exploited in this paper to classify the P300 signals to obtain the user\u2019s intention. It can effectively decrease the cost of recognition time. The user\u2019s intention is then translated into control commands that are used to control the robot manipulator to execute desired tasks."

The designed intention-driven semi-autonomous intelligent robotic (ID-SIR) system seeks to decrease the need for user continuously sending commands through \u201cshared control\u201d to realize it. Here, shared control means that it is a semi-autonomous robot, which only needs very limited high-level commands of users. It indicates that users do not need to continuously send instructions to the BMI system. In practical applications, the user only needs to send one command to \u201ctell\u201d the BMI block which object is desired. All the other work will be finished automatically by the robot."

Compared with the state-of-art system with color-based classifier (Schr\u00f6er et al., 2015), the deep CNN method is more powerful and accurate. For instance, robot in Schr\u00f6er et al. (2015) can only grasp a very specific cup in a predefined place, but the proposed ID-SIR system can grasp any learnt object from any initial position in the range of vision and robot attainability.",

From Figure 1, we can see that the ID-SIR system includes triple layers, i.e., the perception layer, decision-making layer, and execution layer. The perception layer of the system includes a P300-based brain\u2013machine interface subsystem and a visual detection and localization subsystem. The decision-making layer is about how to convert and transmit the intention of users to the control commands of robots. The execution layer is used for robot control.",
                "First, in the BMI subsystem, an EEG cap and a direct-current amplifier (NuAmps) are applied to acquire brain signals. After preprocessing of the signals and feature extraction, a self-adaptive Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (SA-BLDA) algorithm is employed for classification, and the intention of the user is obtained. Finally, an intention command is sent to the decision-making layer and the visual detection and localization subsystem as an output signal.",
                "Second, in the visual detection and localization subsystem, two Microsoft Kinects are applied as the vision input sensors. With the help of region growing algorithm and deep neural network, the positions of the beverage containers are detected and obtained. Applying the Kinect software development kit (SDK), the position information of the user\u2019s mouth is detected. The position information of the desired beverage container and the user\u2019s mouth are then sent to the decision-making layer in real time.",
                "Third, the decision-making layer works as a connector and coordinator between the other modules, which is responsible for information transition and decision-making. It should decide when and how to deliver which beverage container to the mouth of the user according to the inputs from perception layers and feedback from the execution layer.",

Through motion planning and control, the executive commands, generated by the decision-making layer, are well preformed on the robot manipulator to move along the expected path and finish the drinking task."

The stimulus duration is the time cost when one button keeps continuous lighting. In this system, the stimulus duration is 100\u2009ms.

Each finger has a controllable joint and a passive joint. When the controllable joint is grasping an object, the passive joint rotates automatically so that it can hold the object more firmly.

Therefore, only several separated key points in the task space are required to obtain the continuous tracking trajectories of joint space. At present, only the positions of the desired beverage container and the user\u2019s mouth are variable. The remaining position points in the delivering process are predefined. With the consideration of the manipulator\u2019s stability and user\u2019s safety during the task execution, joint velocities of the manipulator are limited at an appropriate speed. Moreover, the manipular state, including position and direction information, is captured and transferred to the robot controller in real time so as to perform accurate control. The manipular state is also sent back to the decision-making layer to make sure that the task is finished."

It is worth pointing out that a drinking task includes delivering process and returning process. In other words, the time cost of a drinking task includes time periods of P300 signal recognition, object recognition, object localization, and robot operating. As seen from Table 3 that the mean time of P300 signal recognition is 5.25\u2009s and the average time of completing one task is 84\u2009s in the online testing.

These four high scores demonstrate well that the ID-SIR system is very capable and suitable for the assistive drinking tasks. The scores of Q5 and Q6 (reaching to 3.5 and 4.25, respectively) shows that subjects did not bear so much burden in the experiment and the user experience of the ID-SIR system is acceptable.

(2012) first applied the invasive MI-based BMI technology with a robot manipulator to complete foam balls reaching and grasping tasks and achieved the accuracy as 95.6% (touch) and 62.2% (grasp) spending about 7\u2009s per task. Later, a female patient with tetraplegia and anarthria was assisted by the system to drink coffee from a bottle speeding more than 85\u2009s each time with 67.7% accuracy. However, this system is inefficient and cause great burden on users. Users have to concentrate continually to control the robot manipulator in real time. Besides, sensors need to be implanted in users\u2019 brains and more than 1\u2009month is required for the operation recovery and training. The robotic assistive systems in Wang et al. (2015) and (Katyal et al., 2013) employed non-invasive BMI technology and eye-tracking technology to a control robot manipulator to grasp or pick objects. Besides, vision algorithms, such as Euclidean clustering extraction (ECE) algorithm or sample consensus (SC) algorithm, were also used to locate objects in RGB-D images. However, they did not consider about detection or assistive drinking problems. Regarding the assistive drinking problem, the system in Schr\u00f6er et al. (2015) incorporated non-invasive MI-based BMI technology with object localization and mouth detection to control the robot. However, the system took almost 2\u2009min to complete one task and the color-based classifier for recognizing a specific colorful plastic cup limited the choices for users.",

                "In this paper, an intention-driven semi-autonomous intelligent robotic (ID-SIR) system has been designed. The system is composed of a P300-based brain\u2013computer interface (BMI) subsystem, a robot manipulator and an automatic-visual-inspection subsystem. It can detect a desired object and deliver it to the mouth of the user. In order to detect the intention of the user, a self-adaption Bayesian linear discriminant analysis algorithm has been exploited and performed to improve training efficiency and accuracy. Besides, a novel two-times region growing algorithm has been proposed to obtain the complete object. One of the important contributions of this paper is that the combination of BMI and semi-autonomous robot technologies eases the burden on the brain and satisfy user\u2019s assisted-living requirement. By using our system, eight subjects successfully complete 10 times assistive drinking tasks with satisfactory accuracies (\u226597.5%). The experiment results have verified the capability of the proposed ID-SIR system and the corresponding algorithms. Compared with the existing BMI system, the advantages of the proposed ID-SIR system are that (1) the object is not predefined and can be put at anywhere in the cross field of sensor\u2019s scanning zone and robot manipulator\u2019s region and (2) both the accuracy and efficiency are considered in the P300-BMI subsystem. Further studies will be conducted to set up the system on a mobile platform and investigate the practical performance on patients."
