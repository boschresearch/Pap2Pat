                        "Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is among the deadliest infectious agents affecting humans. Transmitted by infected fleas, Y. pestis causes primarily bubonic plague. The disease occasionally evolves to pneumonic plague, the most deadly and contagious form of the infection, which is then transmitted from human to human by aerosols.",
                        "Since the beginning of the nineties, plague has been included in the list of re-emerging diseases and Y. pestis is classified as a potential biological weapon for terrorist use. Because antibiotic resistant strains of Y. pestis have been observed or could be engineered for evil use, vaccination against plague might become the only means to fight against the disease.",
                        "Most efforts made in the recent years focused on subunit formulations combining the capsular F1 antigen and the V antigen (LcrV). Such vaccines however require the use of an adjuvant and repeated injections to confer a mostly antibody-dependent protection.",
                        "Other strategies included the attenuation of live Y. pestis by genetic engineering, the introduction of Y. pestis antigens in Salmonella or virus vectors, and DNA vaccination. However, such vaccines are not sufficiently safe and/or efficient against both bubonic plague and pulmonary plague.",
                        "Derbise et al. 2012 [bibliographic reference (1)], which has been published on Feb. 14, 2012, describes the construction of a live vaccine against plague. More precisely, it describes the cloning of the Yersinia pestis caf operon, which codes for surface-expression of the oligomeric Y. pestis F1 antigen and insertion of said operon on a plasmid for electroporation into an attenuated strain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In the resulting Y. pseudotuberculosis strain (strain V674pF1), the nucleic acid coding for surface-expression of the monomer unit of the Y. pestis F1 (i.e., at least the Caf1 polypeptide) is contained in said plasmid.",
                        "In the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cells or strains of the application, the nucleic acid coding for surface-expression of the Caf1 polypeptide is contained in the chromosome of said Y. pseudotuberculosis cells or strains. The application demonstrates an exceptionally high vaccination efficacy against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. The application further provides comparative experimental data, which notably demonstrate that the cells or strains of the application are more efficient than the V674pF1 strain described in Derbise et al. 2012."

                        "The V674TnF1 Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, in which the operon encoding the Y. pestis capsular antigen F1 has been inserted into the chromosome, is an efficient vaccine against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague.",
                        "The V674TnF1 Y. pseudotuberculosis strain notably has the following advantages:\n\n\n- - genetic stability: V674TnF1 is a *Y. pseudotuberculosis* strain,\n    whose genome is much more stable than that of *Y. pestis;*\n  - innocuity: V674TnF1 is highly attenuated, due to the irreversible\n    deletion of three genes essential to distinct virulence mechanisms:\n    adhesion (pH6 Ag/PsaA), iron capture (HPI), secretion of Yop toxins\n    (YopK);\n  - molecular diversity: as a live whole cell vaccine, it offers a high\n    antigenic complexity, which guarantees a response against a broad\n    range of antigenic targets; antigens are in their native form,\n    adequately processed, and produced de novo as long as the bacteria\n    persist;\n  - easy manufacturing: once developed and validated, live vaccines do\n    not require sophisticated equipments and techniques to be produced;\n  - immunogenicity: adjuvant is not required, since bacterial antigens\n    (LPS and other pathogen associated signatures) trigger the innate\n    immune system; in addition to antigens common to *Y. pestis* and *Y.\n    pseudotuberculosis*, V674TnF1 stably produces the F1 capsule, which\n    is a major vaccine target against *Y. pestis;*\n  - single dose administration: this is a major advantage as it greatly\n    facilitates vaccination campaigns and allows a rapid protection;\n  - vaccination possible by two routes: depending on the context, an SC\n    or oral route of vaccination may be preferred.",
                        "Furthermore, V674TnF1 has very high vaccine efficacy. Animals vaccinated with V674TnF1 are fully protected against both bubonic and pneumonic plague, even when exposed to very high doses of the plague bacillus.",
                        "In contrast, V674pF1 achieves a lower vaccine efficacy, more particularly with respect to bubonic plague.",
                        "To our knowledge, the level of protection against bubonic and pneumonic plague conferred by a single dose of the V674TnF1 vaccine is one of the most, and probably the most efficient ever reported.",
                        "We further observed that V674TnF1 surprisingly is more rapidly cleared from the gut of the vaccinated animals than V674pF1, and that subcutaneous or oral administration of V674TnF1 are efficient route of administration depending on the intended use in prevention or urgent treatment."
