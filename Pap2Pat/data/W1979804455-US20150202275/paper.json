    "title": "An Encapsulated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Is a Highly Efficient Vaccine against Pneumonic Plague",
    "date": "2012-02-14",
    "abstract": "Plague is still a public health problem in the world and is re-emerging, but no efficient vaccine is available. We previously reported that oral inoculation of a live attenuated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the recent ancestor of Yersinia pestis, provided protection against bubonic plague. However, the strain poorly protected against pneumonic plague, the most deadly and contagious form of the disease, and was not genetically defined.The sequenced Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 has been irreversibly attenuated by deletion of genes encoding three essential virulence factors. An encapsulated Y. pseudotuberculosis was generated by cloning the Y. pestis F1-encoding caf operon and expressing it in the attenuated strain. The new V674pF1 strain produced the F1 capsule in vitro and in vivo. Oral inoculation of V674pF1 allowed the colonization of the gut without lesions to Peyer's patches and the spleen. Vaccination induced both humoral and cellular components of immunity, at the systemic (IgG and Th1 cells) and the mucosal levels (IgA and Th17 cells). A single oral dose conferred 100% protection against a lethal pneumonic plague challenge (33\u00d7LD(50) of the fully virulent Y. pestis CO92 strain) and 94% against a high challenge dose (3,300\u00d7LD(50)). Both F1 and other Yersinia antigens were recognized and V674pF1 efficiently protected against a F1-negative Y. pestis.The encapsulated Y. pseudotuberculosis V674pF1 is an efficient live oral vaccine against pneumonic plague, and could be developed for mass vaccination in tropical endemic areas to control pneumonic plague transmission and mortality.",

                "Plague, the dreadful infectious disease that caused three major pandemics in history, is still a public health problem. Since the 1980s, an increase of cases worldwide has been observed, leading to categorize plague as a re-emerging disease. Whereas the most active foci of human plague are located in east-central Africa and Madagascar [1], recent cases have also been recorded in areas from where it had disappeared for decades, like Algeria, Libya, Zambia and Jordan [2], [3], [4]. Moreover, because plague is principally a zoonotic disease affecting rodents, the territories where it is endemic in its animal reservoir are much more extended than the observed human plague foci.",
                "Plague is an acute, often fatal infection whose etiologic agent, Yersinia pestis, is a Gram-negative bacillus with an extreme pathogenicity. The accidental transmission of the plague bacillus from rodents to humans by the bite of infected fleas is the most frequent mode of human infection. From the skin, the bacteria migrate to the draining lymph nodes, causing the bubonic form of plague, which evolves toward septicemia and death within one week if treatment is not rapidly started. When the bacteria reach the lungs, an acute pneumonia develops. Patients become highly contagious through the emission of infected aerosols that cause primary pneumonic plague. The disease is then generally fatal within 3 days or less. Human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague favors a rapid spread of the disease in heavily populated areas, as occurred for example recently in Madagascar and in the Democratic Republic of Congo [5], [6]. Although antibiotherapy is currently the main tool to fight the disease, the residual plague mortality in endemic countries remains around 10% or more. This is mainly due to the difficulty for patients from areas far from health structures to receive the treatment on time. An additional cause of concern is the recent identification in Madagascar of two Y. pestis strains naturally resistant to antibiotics, one of which was resistant to eight different antibiotics, including those recommended for plague treatment and prophylaxis [7]. Because this multi-drug resistant Y. pestis resulted from the acquisition of a widespread self-transmissible plasmid [8], the rise of such threatening Y. pestis variants may be anticipated. Finally, Y. pestis is also classified in the list A of pathogens with potential for bioterrorist use established by the US Center for Disease Control due to its pathogenicity and human-to-human transmission [9], and the possibility that the bacteria is engineered to resist to antibiotics for evil use cannot be excluded. In front of such a public health risk, mass vaccination might be one of the only alternatives to protect exposed populations. However, no safe and efficient vaccine against plague is currently available.",
                "The first widely used plague vaccine was the live attenuated Y. pestis EV76 developed in Madagascar. This vaccine, that can have severe secondary effects, is now used in only few countries such as China or the former USSR. The licensed killed whole-cell Y. pestis vaccine from Greer/Miles was recently discontinued because it was reactogenic in humans and conferred only short-term protection [10], requiring annual booster immunizations. Much effort has been made in the recent years to develop new candidate vaccines. The strategies followed to induce protective immunity include the attenuation of live Y. pestis by genetic engineering, the introduction of Y. pestis antigens in Salmonella [11] and virus vectors [12], [13], as well as the production of subunit vaccines combining the capsular F1 antigen and the V antigen (LcrV) [14], [15], [16].",
                "We recently reported that the attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32680 can be used as a live oral vaccine against bubonic plague [17]. The rationale for choosing this approach was to combine the immunogenicity and antigenic complexity of live vaccines with the much lower virulence of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Indeed, Y. pestis is a clone recently emerged from Y. pseudotuberculosis [18], and the two species share more than 95% genetic identity. A reason not to use Y. pestis as live vaccine is its genetic instability, as revealed by the spontaneous genome reductions observed for the EV76 strain, which hampered its vaccine efficiency [19]. That risk is much lower for Y. pseudotuberculosis because such rearrangements in Y. pestis are thought to result from the high number of insertion sequences (IS) present in its genome [20], and Y. pseudotuberculosis has a much lower number of IS copies and so is genetically much more stable [20]. When given orally, Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32680 was able to colonize the gut without causing lesions and stimulated a protective immune response against bubonic plague [17]. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a live attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain as an oral vaccine against plague. However, IP32680 is not suitable for human use because the genetic bases of its attenuation are not known and it does not confer high-level protection against pneumonic plague.",
                "The aim of the present study was to construct a genetically engineered Y. pseudotuberculosis strain irreversibly attenuated in virulence, and able to confer high-level protection against pneumonic plague."

The LD50 of IP32953\u0394HPI (LD50 oral\u200a=\u200a6.8\u00d7108) was 16 times higher than that of the parental IP32953 (4.2\u00d7107 cfu).

The triple deletant (\u0394HPI, \u0394PsaA, \u0394YopK) generated, named V674, exhibited a strong virulence attenuation (LD50>3\u00d7109 cfu), which was comparable to that of strain IP32680 [17]. Mice receiving 108 cfu of V674 presented no signs of disease and no weight loss (Fig. S1A), whereas the parental IP32953 induces severe signs of disease and weight loss before death [17].

The caf operon from CO92, required for surface production of the F1 antigen in Y. pestis, was cloned into the pGEN plasmid. The resulting pGEN-caf plasmid was introduced into V674, generating V674pF1 (Table 1). The formation of a capsule around V674pF1 bacterial cells was observed (Fig. 1A c&d). When measured using an F1-specific ELISA, F1 production by V674pF1 was identical to that of Y. pestis CO92 (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the F1 capsule was produced in vivo, immunohistological staining of F1 was performed on sections of Peyer's patches taken from mice having received V674pF1 five days before. Small foci of F1-positive bacteria were detected using an anti-F1 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1C), while no staining was detected when an irrelevant and isotype-matched biotinylated mAb was used as control (data not shown). The V674pF1 was thus able to produce the F1 capsule within mouse tissues. To determine whether the production of F1 had an impact on the virulence of the vaccine strain, graded doses of bacteria were inoculated orally to mice. Mice having received V674pF1 (108 or 109 cfu) presented no signs of disease and no weight loss (Fig. S1B) and no lethality was observed.

Similar loads were observed with a higher V674pF1 dose (109 cfu). Ten days later (D15), lower levels of V674pF1 were observed, indicating a progressive lessening of infection, in agreement with counts seen in feces.

In a deep organ such as the spleen, amounts of attenuated V674pF1 or V674 found 5 days after inoculation were significantly low as compared to IP32953, in agreement with their attenuation of virulence (Fig. 3A). Again, neither the presence of F1 nor the dose of V674pF1 used affected the splenic load. Ten days later, V674pF1 or V674 were most often not detectable, showing that the attenuated bacteria were rapidly cleared (Fig. 3A).",
                        "The potential development of lesions induced by the bacteria in these target organs was examined. As a reference, the wild type IP32953 at the 108 cfu lethal dose caused severe lesions to both the spleen and Peyer's patches (abscesses, necrosis), together with signs of erosion of the flanking intestinal mucosa (scores >6/10; Fig. 3 B&C). In contrast, the same dose of V674 strain caused mainly congestion and microhemorrhages in the spleen and liver, and infrequent abscesses (scores <2/10, Fig. 3 B) in all three tissues tested. When used at a high dose of 109 cfu to maximally reveal potential harmful effects, theV674pF1 strain also caused mild tissue lesions (scores \u22641/10; Fig. 3 B&C) that were not significantly different from those caused by V674, in spite of the dose difference. In agreement with bacterial clearance, histology of the spleen and Peyer's patches of mice vaccinated with either attenuated strain was normal or almost normal on Day 15 (score <1; Fig. 3 B), showing that tissues had healed. Altogether, our observations demonstrate that V674pF1 inoculated orally is able to colonize the gut and to interact with Peyer's patches, but fails to disseminate to high levels in the spleen, confirming its very high attenuation."

Because splenocytes from only half of the mice vaccinated with V674pF1 produced IL-17 upon stimulation by F1, the mean production was not statistically significant. Notably, Y. pseudotuberculosis antigens induced a stronger production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 than F1 (\u00d715 and \u00d76 respectively), indicating that the multiple antigens included are important targets of cell-mediated immunity."

While all unvaccinated animals died within 3\u20134 days (Fig. 6A), a single oral inoculation of V674pF1 (108 cfu) resulted in complete (100%) protection.

                "Our initial study demonstrated that the naturally attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32680 could serve as an oral vaccine against bubonic plague [17]. However, this strain had weaknesses that precluded its development for human use. Because its genome had not been analyzed, its naturally low virulence could have resulted from a point mutation, with the possibility that a reverse mutation could restore virulence. In addition, IP32680 inoculated orally conferred only a weak level of protection (30%) against the pneumonic form of plague [17], after two vaccine doses. The goals of the present work were therefore twofold: first, to obtain a strain whose attenuation was irreversible and well characterized, and second to provide high-level protection against pneumonic plague. The first objective was reached by using strain IP32953, whose genome has been sequenced [35], and to attenuate it by deleting three major virulence genes, thus preventing reversion to virulence.",
                "The genetically attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis V674 strain provided 69% protection against pneumonic plague, and therefore was clearly more efficient than our previous IP32680 strain. However, it was still less efficient than attenuated Y. pestis strains used as plague vaccines in the past such as EV76 [36] or recently proposed engineered strains [37], [38]. Since the pioneer studies of Meyer, the F1 antigen composing the Y. pestis capsule is recognized as a major target of protective immunity due to its abundance and easy access at the bacteria surface [39]. F1 is absent from Y. pseudotuberculosis, and to enhance the efficiency of V674, the second step of our work was to introduce the caf operon coding for F1 into V674. With the presence of F1 at its surface, V674pF1 conferred full protection (100%) against pneumonic plague. Even against a very high intranasal challenge dose of CO92 (107 cfu, i.e. 3,300\u00d7LD50), V674pF1 had an excellent protective score (94%). V674pF1, after a single oral dose, thus reached a level of protection that had, to our knowledge, not been reported for other live vaccines, including attenuated Y. pestis strains [37], [40], [41] or recombinant vectors producing Y. pestis antigens such as Salmonella [11], [42] or viruses [12], [43].",
                "The F1 capsule is not an essential virulence factor for Y. pestis in mammals (reviewed by [44]), as shown by the fact that F1-negative Y. pestis mutants are still mortal for mice, primates and humans ([45], [46], the present work) although it is required to achieve full pathogenicity in certain mouse strains [47]. Y. pestis virulence is recognized to be multifactorial, so that the transfer of a single gene in an avirulent Y. pseudotuberculosis was unlikely to increase its virulence. Indeed, high oral doses of V674pF1 induced no lethality, in agreement with similar observations in F1-producing Salmonella candidate vaccines [11].",
                "The live attenuated vaccines have several advantages over subunit vaccines. Recently developed candidate vaccines against plague are composed of two antigens: the Y. pestis-specific capsular F1 antigen and the virulence plasmid-encoded V antigen (LcrV) common to the three pathogenic Yersinia species. Molecular and live vaccines based on F1 and V provide protection to mice against pneumonic plague [12], [13], [14], [16], however they confer only variable levels of protection to non-human primates [48]. Such molecular vaccines using Alum as adjuvant mainly induce antibody production against the F1 antigen [49], allowing virulent Y. pestis variants lacking the F1 antigen to escape from the protective immunity of anti-F1 antibodies [46]. In contrast, live vaccines are strong inducers not only of humoral immunity but also of cell-mediated immunity [48], an important component of protection against pneumonic plague [50]. We observed that splenocytes from mice orally vaccinated with both V674pF1 and V674 strongly produced IFN\u03b3 upon restimulation in vitro with Y. pseudotuberculosis antigens, indicating the development of a Y. pseudotuberculosis\u2013specific cellular immunity. IFN\u03b3 typically characterizes the type 1 response critical for optimal vaccine-induced protection against Y. pestis infection. Indeed, it was previously shown that injection of IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 protects mice against Y. pestis infection [51] and that neutralization of these cytokines abrogates vaccine-induced protection against pneumonic plague [52]. IFN\u03b3 activates phagocytes and help them destroy internalized bacteria. Therefore the potent IFN\u03b3 production by splenocytes from vaccinated mice observed in the present work may have such a role. The recruitment of Yersinia-specific cells producing IL-17 (Th17) was also observed. There is growing evidence that the development of Th17 cells is critical to vaccine-induced protection against mucosal infections by pathogenic bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi [31], [53]. Indeed, IL-17 is a powerful inducer of PMN recruitment and release of antimicrobial peptides, and contributes to immunity induced against pneumonic plague by an attenuated Y. pestis candidate vaccine [34]. Because such effector Th17 cells can collaborate with Th1 lymphocytes [53], the induction of both subsets by V674pF1 may be a key of the high protection observed against Y. pestis in the lungs.",
                "It is most notable that vaccination using the live attenuated V674pF1 Y. pseudotuberculosis strain provided full protection against pneumonic plague caused by a virulent Y. pestis strains lacking the F1 antigen, whereas the live attenuated Y. pestis KIM D27 (\u0394pgm), used as vaccine in other studies, failed to protect [46], [49]. This inability of a live Y. pestis to protect was interpreted as resulting from a focalization of the immune response against the abundant F1 covering the bacteria, to the detriment of other antigens [49]. On the contrary, we show here that V674pF1 was able to trigger immunity simultaneously against F1 and the large array of target antigens common to Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, as demonstrated by the comparable IgG titers against these antigens observed after vaccination with vaccine strains producing F1 or not. Moreover, the cellular response against Yersinia antigens was not only comparable after vaccination with V674 or V674pF1, but was also much stronger than that induced by the F1 antigen. This absence of focalization of the immune response on F1 thereby greatly enhances the likelihood of protection against a wide spectrum of Y. pestis variants. The contrast with studies using KIM D27 as vaccine [46], [49] cannot be ascribed to a difference in the amount of F1 capsule because V674pF1 produces as much F1 as Y. pestis. It could rather result from yet unidentified differences of immunogenicity between the two Yersinia species, or on the different routes of vaccination (intramuscular versus oral). In this regard, the F1 capsule also did not alter the capacity of the Y. pseudotuberculosis strain to settle in the intestinal tract. This was however not surprising because Y. pestis is virulent by the oral route, as shown by human plague cases after eating meat from an infected animal [54]. That V674pF1 was efficient through the oral route was an additional advantage because oral vaccination is both convenient, well accepted by persons, and avoids the risk of contamination through used syringes during mass vaccination.",
                "In previous studies of mouse vaccination with F1-V subunit vaccines, repeated injections were required to obtain full protection [14], [16]. In contrast, full protection against pneumonic plague was obtained in the present work after vaccination with a single oral dose of V674pF1. The capacity of live vaccines to stimulate immunity for an extended period of time was the likely key to this efficiency. V674pF1 given by the oral route persisted for weeks in the gut, allowing a prolonged antigen presentation to the immune system.",
                "F1 production significantly improved the performance of V674pF1 compared to V674, consistent with the development of F1-targeted effector mechanisms efficient in the lungs. The production of high amounts of IgG and IgA indicated that the humoral immune response was triggered at both systemic and mucosal levels. Antibodies contribute to defense against pneumonic plague, as shown by previous studies in which non-immune or immunodeficient mice were protected by instillation of anti-F1 antibodies in the airways [55], [56], [57]. Seric IgG have an easy access to the highly vascularized lung tissues and those induced by V674pF1 may have played such a role. Because immunization started at a mucosal surface, IgA could also have been actors of V674pF1-induced lung immunity [58]. No IgA could however be detected in bronchoalveolar lavages, showing that IgA were not necessary to protection.",
                "In summary, this study demonstrated that a high level protection against pneumonic plague can be obtained by a single oral vaccination with the live attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis V674pF1 producing the Y. pestis F1 capsule. Because the strain has been irreversibly attenuated by deletion of essential virulence factors, it colonizes the intestinal tract without causing lesions and stimulates both humoral and cell-mediated anti-plague immunity. Easy to administrate orally and costless to produce, this candidate vaccine is therefore well adapted to mass vaccination in endemic tropical regions, offering promising perspectives to control pneumonic plague mortality and transmission."
