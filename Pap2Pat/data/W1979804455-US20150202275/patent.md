# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The application relates to means, which are notably useful for vaccination against bubonic plague and against pneumonic plague, as well as to the biotechnological and medical applications thereof. The means of the application notably comprise Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cells or strains, which express at least one Yersinia pestis Caf1 polypeptide or at least one antigenic fragment of Y. pestis Caf1. More particularly, the means of the application comprise Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cells or strains, which express the Y. pestis F1 protein or capsule.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is among the deadliest infectious agents affecting humans. Transmitted by infected fleas, Y. pestis causes primarily bubonic plague. The disease occasionally evolves to pneumonic plague, the most deadly and contagious form of the infection, which is then transmitted from human to human by aerosols.

Since the beginning of the nineties, plague has been included in the list of re-emerging diseases and Y. pestis is classified as a potential biological weapon for terrorist use. Because antibiotic resistant strains of Y. pestis have been observed or could be engineered for evil use, vaccination against plague might become the only means to fight against the disease.

Most efforts made in the recent years focused on subunit formulations combining the capsular F1 antigen and the V antigen (LcrV). Such vaccines however require the use of an adjuvant and repeated injections to confer a mostly antibody-dependent protection.

Other strategies included the attenuation of live Y. pestis by genetic engineering, the introduction of Y. pestis antigens in Salmonella or virus vectors, and DNA vaccination. However, such vaccines are not sufficiently safe and/or efficient against both bubonic plague and pulmonary plague.

Derbise et al. 2012 [bibliographic reference (1)], which has been published on Feb. 14, 2012, describes the construction of a live vaccine against plague. More precisely, it describes the cloning of the Yersinia pestis caf operon, which codes for surface-expression of the oligomeric Y. pestis F1 antigen and insertion of said operon on a plasmid for electroporation into an attenuated strain of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In the resulting Y. pseudotuberculosis strain (strain V674pF1), the nucleic acid coding for surface-expression of the monomer unit of the Y. pestis F1 (i.e., at least the Caf1 polypeptide) is contained in said plasmid.

In the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cells or strains of the application, the nucleic acid coding for surface-expression of the Caf1 polypeptide is contained in the chromosome of said Y. pseudotuberculosis cells or strains. The application demonstrates an exceptionally high vaccination efficacy against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. The application further provides comparative experimental data, which notably demonstrate that the cells or strains of the application are more efficient than the V674pF1 strain described in Derbise et al. 2012.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present application relates to the subject-matter as defined in the claims as filed and as herein described.

More particularly, the application relates to cell(s), strain(s), composition(s), pharmaceutical composition(s), immunogenic composition(s), vaccine(s), as well as to the biotechnological and medical applications thereof, more particularly to the in vitro and in vivo applications thereof, more particularly to the immunogenic and/or vaccine applications thereof.

A cell of the application is a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell, more particularly a recombinant Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell.

When used for therapeutic purposes, the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell of the application is avirulent, more particularly attenuated, still more particularly genetically attenuated.

The Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell of the application comprises nucleic acid coding for at least one Yersinia pestis Caf1 polypeptide or for at least one antigenic fragment of Yersinia pestis Caf1. More particularly, said nucleic acid codes for the Yersinia pestis F1 protein, still more particularly for the Y. pestis capsule.

Said coding nucleic acid is comprised in, more particularly integrated into the chromosome of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell of the application.

A cell of the application is notably useful as an immunogen against plague, more particularly against both bubonic plague and pulmonary plague.

Chromosomal insertion of said coding nucleic acid leads to unexpectedly higher levels of protection against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague, more particularly against bubonic plague.

A genetically attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis cell of the application notably has the following advantages:


- - genetic stability: the genome of said *Y. pseudotuberculosis* cell
    is much more stable than that of *Y. pestis;*
  - innocuity: said *Y. pseudotuberculosis* cell can be highly
    attenuated, e.g., by (partial or complete) deletion of one or more
    genes essential to virulence mechanism(s), more particularly of
    three genes essential to distinct virulence mechanisms;
  - molecular diversity: when used as a live whole cell vaccine, it
    offers a high antigenic complexity, which guarantees a response
    against a broad range of antigenic targets; antigens are in their
    native form, adequately processed, and produced de novo as long as
    the bacteria persist;
  - easy manufacturing: once developed and validated, live vaccines do
    not require sophisticated equipments and techniques to be produced;
  - immunogenicity: adjuvant is not required, since bacterial antigens
    (LPS and other pathogen associated signatures) trigger the innate
    immune system; in addition to antigens common to *Y. pestis* and *Y.
    pseudotuberculosis*, said *Y. pseudotuberculosis* cell can stably
    produce the *Y. pestis* F1 capsule, which is a major vaccine target
    against *Y. pestis;*
  - single dose administration: this is a major advantage as it greatly
    facilitates vaccination campaigns and allows a rapid protection;
  - vaccination possible by two routes: depending on the context, a
    subcutaneous or oral route of vaccination may be preferred.

The inventors consider that the level of protection against bubonic plague and pneumonic plague that is achieved by the means of the application is one of the most, and probably the most efficient ever reported.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The application relates to a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell.

Said Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell is a recombinant cell.

Said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell can be of any serotype, e.g., of serotype I, II, III, IV or V, for example of serotype I. Said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell can be a cell of any Y. pseudotuberculosis strain.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell or strain is of serotype I.

Y. pseudotuberculosis strains are available to the person of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., from collections of microorganisms (e.g., CRBIP, DSMZ, ATCC, NCTC), from commercial sources or by isolation from contaminated biological material (e.g., from contaminated water or soil) or from a contaminated organism (e.g., an infected human or an infected non-human animal).

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell or strain is Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 that comes from the collection of the Yersinia Research Unit and National Reference Laboratory [the genome sequence of strain IP32953 is available under accession number NC—006155, more particularly NC—006155.1].

Y. pseudotuberculosis is en enteric pathogen. Y. pseudotuberculosis infection (or pseudotuberculosis) leads to acute digestive disease, sometimes followed by septicemia, and sometimes, but rarely articular and/or cutaneous symptoms.

Y. pseudotuberculosis infection in humans usually leads to gastroenteritis. In some countries such as Russia and Japan, specific strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis cause Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), characterized by erythematous skin rash, desquamation, exanthema, hyperhemic tongue, reactive arthritis, toxic shock syndrome, septicemia.

In non-human animals, Y. pseudotuberculosis is a frequent cause of morbidity and sometimes mortality.

Therefore, when the Y. pseudotuberculosis cell of the application is intended for a therapeutic application, it is (or has been made) avirulent, i.e., said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is safe enough to be administered without any danger of clinical infection, either for the recipient or for any contact of the recipient. In other words, the risk associated with the administration of said Y. pseudotuberculosis is minimized, if not totally eliminated.

More particularly, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell has lost the ability to cause pseudotuberculosis, more generally to cause enteric disease and septicemia.

According to an embodiment of the application, said avirulent Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is still capable of growth, more particularly of replication in a host organism (such as a human or a non-human mammal), but has lost ability to cause said disease in said host organism.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is avirulent to a healthy mammal, more particularly to a healthy human being.

Said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell can be naturally avirulent, or it can be avirulent by genetic and/or chemical attenuation.

Methods for attenuation of pathogenic bacteria are known in the art. Genetic attenuation can be achieved by inactivating one or more gene(s) involved in metabolic pathway(s) of the bacteria, more particularly in one or more pathogenic mechanism(s) of the bacteria, and/or by inactivating one or more gene(s) involved in or responsible for the production of virulence factor(s) of the bacteria.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is genetically attenuated.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is irreversibly attenuated.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is genetically and irreversibly attenuated.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is attenuated by partial or complete deletion of one or more genes, still more particularly by partial or complete deletion of one or more genes involved in or responsible for the production of virulence factor(s) of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Such genes comprise the High Pathogenicity Island genes (HPI), the yopK gene and the psaA gene.

Partial or complete deletion of genes can be achieved e.g., by allelic exchange following homologous recombination (cf. bibliographic references (1) and (8), i.e., Derbise et al. 2012 and 2003).

Partial deletion is achieved to an extent sufficient to inactivate the function of the gene.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is attenuated by partial or complete deletion of one or more genes selected from the HPI genes, the yopK gene and the psaA gene, for example by partial or complete deletion of two or more genes selected from the HPI genes, the yopK gene and the psaA gene.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is attenuated:


- - by partial or complete deletion of at least one of the yopK and the
    psaA genes, still more particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of at least one of the HPI genes,
    still more particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of at least one HPI gene, which is a
    YPTB gene, still more particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of at least the HPI genes YPTB1585
    to YPTB1602 (YPTB genes as identified in the *Y. pseudotuberculosis*
    strain IP32953, the genome sequence of which is available under
    NC_(—)006155, more particularly under NC_(—)006155.1), still more
    particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of a number of HPI genes that is
    sufficient to attenuate the HPI-induced virulence, still more
    particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of all the HPI genes, still more
    particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of at least one of the yopK and the
    psaA genes and by partial or complete deletion of at least one, at
    least two or all of the HPI genes, or at least from YPTB1585 to
    YPTB1602, still more particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of at least one of the yopK and the
    psaA genes and by partial or complete deletion of at least from
    YPTB1585 to YPTB1602, still more particularly
  - by partial or complete deletion of the yopK and the psaA genes and
    by partial or complete deletion of at least one, at least two or all
    of the HPI genes;
  - by partial or complete deletion of the yopK and the psaA genes and
    by partial or complete deletion of at least from YPTB1585 to
    YPTB1602.

According to an embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is attenuated by partial or complete deletion of the HPI genes YPTB1585 to YPTB1602, of the yopK gene and of the psaA gene, still more particularly by partial deletion of the HPI genes, of the yopK gene and of the psaA gene.

Illustrative Y. pseudotuberculosis HPI gene sequences are available and identified in the genome sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 (genome sequence NC—006155, more particularly NC—006155.1). For example, the YPTB1585 through YPTB1602 sequences extend from position 1,914,026 to position 1,949,600 of said genome sequence. An illustrative Y. pseudotuberculosis yopK gene sequence is available and identified in the pYV plasmid sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 (plasmid sequence NC—006153, more particularly NC—006153.2). For example, the yopK sequence extends from position 28,491 to position 29,039 of said Y. pseudotuberculosis plasmid sequence (complement sequence).

An illustrative Y. pseudotuberculosis psaA gene sequence is available and identified in the genome sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 (genome sequence NC—006155, more particularly NC—006155.1). For example, the psaA sequence extends from position 1,588,872 to position 1,589,348 of said genome sequence.

According to an alternative or complementary embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is strongly attenuated, e.g., its LD50 for mice is higher than 1010 CFU via the oral route.

Said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell can be a killed cell or a live cell.

According to an advantageous embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell is a live cell. According to an advantageous embodiment of the application, said Y. pseudotuberculosis cell has retained the capacity of in vitro and/or in vivo replication, e.g., in vitro replication on a culture medium such as the Luria Bertani Broth (LB) medium and/or in vivo replication in a non-human mammal such as a mouse or in a human.

The Y. pseudotuberculosis cell of the application comprises nucleic acid coding for at least one Yersinia pestis Caf1 polypeptide or for at least one antigenic fragment of Y. pestis Caf1.

More particularly, the Y. pseudotuberculosis cell of the application comprises nucleic acid coding for surface-expression of at least one Yersinia pestis Caf1 polypeptide or for surface-expression of at least one antigenic fragment of Y. pestis Caf1.

Yersinia pestis Caf1 is a polypeptide that is expressed by naturally-occurring Y. pestis cells.

Y. pestis Caf1 is the monomer subunit that forms the major component of the pathogen capsule, i.e., the Y. pestis fraction 1 antigen (F1).

Y. pestis F1 is known to be involved in Y. pestis resistance to phagocytosis.

The naturally-occurring biogenesis process follows a chaperone/usher pathway, according to which Y. pestis Caf1 polypeptides are transported from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, and are assembled in oligomeric form at the bacterial surface, whereby forming the F1 protein.

In the periplasm, a chaperone protein (Caf1M) binds to a Caf1 polypeptide and transport it to the outer membrane. The chaperone:Caf1 complexes are then targeted to the usher (Caf1A), located in the outer membrane, where the Caf1 signal peptide is cleaved and where the mature Caf1 polypeptides are joined together to form a growing chain, which is subsequently translocated through the outer membrane to the surface of the bacteria.

The Caf1 monomer has a molecular weight (MW) of about 17.6 kDa before cleavage of the signal peptide.

After cleavage of the signal peptide sequence, the mature Caf1 monomer has a MW of about 15.5-16.5 kDa. The calculated pI is of about 4.3.

The Caf1 oligomer that is formed at the bacterial surface generally has a MW higher than 1,000 kDa.

Y. pestis can be classified into at least three biotypes [Antigua (A), Medievalis (M) or Orientalis (O)] on the basis of their ability to use glycerol and to reduce nitrate.

In the application, Y. pestis can be of any biotype, e.g., of the A biotype, or of the M biotype or of the O biotype, for example of the M or O biotype, more particularly of the O biotype.

    and/or, more particularly and
  - at least of gene coding for the *Y. pestis* Caf1R protein of SEQ ID
    NO: 18, e.g., the *Y. pestis* caf1R nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO: 17.

According to an embodiment, the application relates to an avirulent Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell, more particularly to a genetically attenuated Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell, which derives from a Y. pseudotuberculosis cell, more particularly from a cell of Y. pseudotuberculosis strain IP32953 (the chromosomal sequence of which is the sequence available under accession number NC—006155), by:


- - deletion or inactivation of one or more genes selected from HPI,
    yopK and psaA (as above described and/or below illustrated) and by
  - chromosomal insertion of said nucleic acid coding for the expression
    of at least one *Yersinia pestis* Caf1 polypeptide or antigenic
    fragment at the surface of said *Y. pseudotuberculosis* cell (as
    above described and/or below illustrated).

The application also relates to a plurality of cells, which comprises at least one Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cell of the application, as well as to a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain, which comprises at least one cell of the application, or which consists or essentially consists of cells of the application.

The application also relates to a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis strain, wherein more than 50%, more particularly more than 55%, still more particularly more than 60%, still of more particularly more than 65%, still of more particularly more than 70%, still of more particularly more than 75%, still of more particularly more than 80%, still of more particularly more than 85%, still of more particularly more than 90%, still of more particularly more than 95% of the cells of said strain are encapsulated by a Y. pestis pseudo capsule.

Said Y. pseudotuberculosis strain advantageously is an avirulent Y. pseudotubercolis strain as herein described and/or illustrated. Said Y. pseudotuberculosis strain may consist or essentially consist of cells of the application.

The application also relates to said cell, said plurality of cells and to said strains, for use as an immunogen, more particularly for use as an immunogen against plague, still more particularly against bulbonic plague and/or pulmonary plague, still more particularly against bulbonic plague or pulmonary plague, still more particularly against bulbonic plague and pulmonary plague.

In the application, said nucleic acid or operon, which codes for said at least one Y. pestis Caf1 polypeptide (e.g., for the Y. pestis F1 protein or capsule) or for said at least one antigenic fragment of Y. pestis Caf1, more particularly said nucleic acid or operon, which codes for surface expression thereof, is inserted in (or integrated into) the chromosome of Y. pseudotuberculosis.

Chromosomal insertion of said nucleic acid or operon leads to unexpectedly higher levels of protection against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague, more particularly against bubonic plague.

For example, a single oral inoculation of live, attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis, in which the Y. pestis F1 operon has been inserted into the chromosome, can achieve:


- - 100% protection against pneumonic plague after a challenge with
    3,300×LD₅₀ of *Y. pestis*, as well as
  - 100% protection against bubonic plague after a challenge with
    100×LD₅₀ of *Y. pestis* \[LD₅₀=50% lethal dose\].

By comparison, when the Y. pestis F1 operon has not been inserted into the chromosome of Y. pseudotuberculosis, but is provided by a plasmid contained in Y. pseudotuberculosis, the vaccination protection is, under the same experimental conditions, of:


- - 80% against pneumonic plague after a challenge with 3,300×LD₅₀ of
    *Y. pestis*, and
  - 81% against bubonic plague after a challenge with 100×LD₅₀ of *Y.
    pestis.*

It is believed that the level of protection against bubonic plague and pneumonic plague that is achieved by the means of the application is one of the most, and probably the most efficient ever reported.

A cell of the application can be used with or without immunologic adjuvant, more particularly with an adjuvant, which accelerates, prolongs, or enhances the quality of immune responses to the Y. pestis polypeptide(s) or protein(s) that are expressed at the surface of the Y. pseudotuberculosis cell of the application.

Immunologic adjuvants are known to the person of ordinary skill in the art. Illustrative immunologic adjuvant comprises Freund's complete adjuvant, Freund's incomplete adjuvant, the Ribi adjuvant system, an adjuvant based on aluminium salts (e.g., alum) and/or liposomes, bacterial LPS.

Advantageously, a cell of the application can be used without immunologic adjuvant.

Said cell, said plurality of cells or said strain can be administered via any route that the person of ordinary skill in the art may find appropriate.

According to an embodiment of the application, said administration route is a non-invasive route, more particularly a route that does not require the use of any canula or other highly invasive instrument.

According to an embodiment of the application, said administration route is the oral route, the intranasal route, the subcutaneous route, the intradermal route, the intramuscular route. According to an embodiment of the application, said administration route is a non-oral route, more particularly the intranasal route, the subcutaneous route, the intradermal route, the intramuscular route, more particularly the subcutaneous route.

According to an embodiment of the application, said cell, plurality of cells or strain is administered by spray (e.g., nasal and/or oral spray) and/or by injection (e.g., subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection), more particularly by injection (e.g., subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection), more particularly by subcutaneous injection.

Moreover, chromosomal insertion of said nucleic acid or operon may lead to particularly high vaccination efficacy, when the vaccination cells or strain is administered via routes other than the oral route, more particularly via a subcutaneous administration. Via such non-oral, lower doses are required to achieve the same vaccination efficacy and/or the same dose achieves protection against higher Y. pestis doses.

Said cell, said plurality of cells or said strain can be administered at any dose that the person of ordinary skill in the art may find appropriate, taking due account of the administration route contemplated and taking due account of the age, weight and health status of the intended recipient.

According to an embodiment of the application, said cell, plurality of cells or strain is administered at a dose sufficient to induce an immune response in the recipient organism, more particularly in a human or non-human animal or non-human mammal.

Said immune response can e.g., comprise a humoral response and/or a cell-mediated immune response, advantageously both a humoral response and a cell-mediated immune response.

According to an embodiment of the application, the dose at which said cell, plurality of cells or strain is administered is sufficient to induce both an immune response and a cell-mediated immune response at both the systemic level (e.g., IgG and Th1 cells) and the mucosal level (e.g., IgA and Th17 cells).

The application also relates to a composition, more particularly a pharmaceutical composition, still more particularly an immunogenic composition or vaccine, which comprises at least one of the following elements:


- - at least one cell of the application,
  - at least one plurality of cells of the application,

Said composition, more particularly a pharmaceutical composition, still more particularly an immunogenic composition or vaccine, may further comprise at least one pharmaceutically and/or physiologically acceptable vehicle (diluent, excipient, additive, pH adjuster, emulsifier or dispersing agent, preservative, surfactant, gelling agent, as well as buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agent, etc.), more particularly at least one vehicle suitable for vaccine administration to human or non-human animal or non-human mammal.

Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles and formulations include all known pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles and formulations, such as those described in “Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy”, 20th edition, Mack Publishing Co.; and “Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems”, Ansel, Popovich and Allen Jr., Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In general, the nature of the vehicle will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise, injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids, including water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, buffers, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, sesame oil, combinations thereof, or the like as a vehicle. The medium also may contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, buffers, preservatives and the like. The carrier and composition can be sterile, and the formulation suits the mode of administration.

A composition, pharmaceutical composition, immunogenic composition or vaccine of the application can e.g., be a liquid solution, suspension, emulsion, sustained release formulation, or powder.

Said composition, more particularly said pharmaceutical composition, still more particularly said immunogenic composition or vaccine, may further comprise an immunologic adjuvant, e.g., as above-described. However, an advantageous feature of the cell, plurality of cells and strain of the application is that such an adjuvant is not necessarily needed for induction of a protective effect.

The application also relates to a method of treatment of a subject in need thereof, e.g., a human, a non-human animal or a non-human mammal, which comprises administering to said subject at least one cell, plurality of cells or strain of the application, more particularly at a dose sufficient to induce an immune response as above-described.

### EXAMPLES

**Example 1**

We produced a Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, which is both avirulent and genetically defined for use as vaccine against plague. To this end, we irreversibly attenuated the Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 strain by deletion of genes encoding three essential virulence factors (the High pathogenicity island, YopK and the pH6 Ag/PsaA).

We cloned the Y. pestis F1-encoding caf operon in a plasmid and introduced it into the attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, whereby generating an encapsulated derivative of attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain. The resulting strain, named V674pF1 (1), produced the F1 capsule in vitro and in vivo. Oral inoculation of V674pF1 allowed the colonization of the gut without causing lesions in Peyer's patches and the spleen. Vaccination with V674pF1 induced both humoral and cellular components of immunity, at the systemic (IgG and Th1 cells) and the mucosal levels (IgA and Th17 cells). A single oral dose (108 CFU) protected 100% of animals against pneumonic plague (challenge dose 105 CFU, i.e., 33×LD50) and 94% with a higher dose (103 CFU, i.e., 3,300×LD50) (1).

However, this vaccination protocol protected only 81% of the animals against bubonic plague with a low challenge dose (103 CFU, i.e., 100×LD50) (cf. results below and FIG. 7A). In addition, we observed that production of the F1 capsule was unstable.

We generated another form of encapsulated derivative by inserting the Y. pestis caf operon encoding F1 into the chromosome of the attenuated Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, using a Tn7 mini-transposon. The resulting strain, named V674TnF1, was compared to strain V674pF1 for stability of F1 production, potential residual virulence of the strain and protective efficacy.

**Ethics**

Animals were housed in the Institut Pasteur animal facilities accredited by the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on live mice (accreditation B 75 15-01, issued on May 22, 2008), in appliance of the French and European regulations on care on protection of the Laboratory Animals (ED Directive 86/609, French Law 2001-486 issued on Jun. 6, 2001). Protocols were approved by the veterinary staff of the Institut Pasteur animal facility and were performed in compliance with the NIH Animal Welfare Insurance #A5476-01 issued on Feb. 7, 2007.

Y. pestis Strain

Y. pestis strain CO92 is a wild type strain of the Orientalis biotype (5).

The complete genome sequence of Y. pestis strain CO92 is available under accession number AL590842. In addition, Y. pestis strain CO92 contains three plasmids: pMT1 (also named pFra; accession number AL117211), pCD1 (also named pYV; accession number AL117189), and pPCP1 (also named pPLa; accession number AL109969). Plasmid pMT1 contains the caf operon and encodes the F1 capsule.

Y. pseudotuberculosis Strains

The Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 strain is a wild type serotype I strain (6). The complete genome sequence of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 is available from NCBI under NC—006155.

Strain IP32953p was produced by introduction of plasmid pKOBEG-sacB into strain IP32953 by electroporation (7). The vector pKOBEG-sacB (8) contains the Red operon expressed under the control of the arabinose inducible pBAD promoter and the sacB gene that is necessary to cure the plasmid (8, 9).

Strain V674 was produced from strain IP32953p by deletion of the HPI, yopK and psaA, as described in (1).

**Construction of V674TnF1 and Verification of F1 Capsule Production**

Cloning of the Caf Locus:

Cloning of the Y. pestis caf locus in the mini transposon Tn7 was performed as follows: The 5 kb caf locus that encodes the F1 capsule of Y. pestis was amplified by PCR with primers A (5′-ATAAGAATGAATTCGTGACTGATCAATATGTTGG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 1) and B (5′-CGTTAGGGCCCGTCAGTCTTGCTATCAATGC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 2), which add an ApaI and EcoRI site at the extremities of the locus. The PCR product was ligated to the corresponding sites in the mini transposon Tn7 carried by the pUC18R6KTn7-CmR plasmid (FIG. 1), generating plasmid pUC18R6KTn7-CmR-caf. The presence of the caf locus was verified by PCR using primers 157A (5′-CAGGAACCACTAGCACATC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 3) and 157B (5′-CCCCCACAAGGTTCTCAC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 4) internal to the caf1 gene.

Insertion of the Caf Locus into the Y. pseudotuberculosis Chromosome

To insert the caf locus into the Y. pseudotuberculosis V674 chromosome we used the mini Tn7 tool (2). Plasmids pUC18R6KTn7-CmR-caf and pTNS2 (transposase provider) were used together to electroporate the Y. pseudotuberculosis vaccine strain V674 (1), and the transposants were selected on LB agar plates containing Chloramphenicol.

The presence of the transposon that contains the caf locus (named “Mini Tn7-caf-CmR transposon”, FIG. 2) was verified by PCR, using two pairs of primers: 744 (5′-CACAGCATAACTGGACTGATTTC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 5) and 747 (5′-GCTATACGTGTTTGCTGATCAAGATG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 6) for the left junction, and 745 (5′-ATTAGCTTACGACGCTACACCC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 7) and 746 (5′-ACGCCACCGGAAGAACCGATACCT-3′; SEQ ID NO: 8) for the right junction. The recombinant Y. pseudotuberculosis strain that contains the Tn7-caf-CmR region in its chromosome was named V674TnF1.

Since the transposase-encoding plasmid is not harbored by the recombinant V674TnF1, excision of the Tn7-caf-CmR region by transposition does not occur.

Verification of F1 Capsule Production

To estimate the F1 capsule production by the recombinant V674TnF1 vaccine, the strain was grown at 37° C. in LB broth, and a F1 dipstick test (3) was performed on cell suspensions. As shown on FIG. 3, a band at the same position as the positive Y. pestis control was observed with CO92 (positive control) whereas no signal was detected with the V674 parental strain (negative control), thus indicating that V674TnF1 synthesizes the F1 capsule.

To further visualize the F1 capsule, we examined microscopically the V674TnF1 strain grown at 37° C. Exclusion of India ink around V674TnF1 bacterial cells confirmed the presence of the capsule (FIG. 4).

Furthermore, all bacterial cells were surrounded by a halo, indicating that, in contrast to V674 pF1, all bacteria produced the F1 capsule. After two subcultures in LB, all bacterial cells continued to produce F1. Therefore, the synthesis of F1 is much more stable in V674TnF1 than in V674pF1.

**Attenuation of Virulence**

The V674 strain used to construct V674pF1 and V674TnF1 had been modified to attenuate its virulence by deletion of 3 virulence factors (the High Pathogenicity Island, the pH6 Ag/PsaA pilus, and the YopK factor) by genetic engineering (1).

The virulence of the V674pF1 and V674TnF1 strains was tested after intragastric administration. In both cases, the LD50 was >1010 CFU, demonstrating a very strong attenuation of virulence. However, we noticed occasional mouse deaths after intragastric vaccination, which were not related to the vaccine dose used (see Table 1 below), and which most likely resulted from accidental lesions caused by the intragastric canulla used to administrate the vaccine.

The virulence of the V674TnF1 strain was also tested after subcutaneous (SC) administration. After subcutaneous injection of doses of the V674TnF1 strain up to 109 CFU, no deaths were observed Skin papules were observed in all mice vaccinated with 109 CFU of V674TnF1, in about 50% at 108 CFU and <10% at 107 CFU.

**Persistence of V674TnF1 in Mice Upon Oral Inoculation**

After oral inoculation of either 108 or 109 CFU, V674TnF1 bacterial cells were detected in the feces of only 3 out of 8 mice on D20, and only with the 109 CFU vaccine dose (FIG. 5 A), indicating a relatively rapid clearance of the vaccine from the gut lumen.

In Peyer's patches and the spleen, V674TnF1 was detected after 5 days, but was cleared after 15 days (FIGS. 5B and 5C), regardless of the dose administered.

In contrast, V674pF1 bacterial cells were still detectable in Peyer's patches and in the spleen of 1/5 mouse on D15, indicating that V674TnF1 is more rapidly cleared from the vaccinated animals than the V674pF1 strain.

Altogether, our observations demonstrate that V674TnF1 administered orally is able to colonize the gut, Peyer's patches and spleen, but this colonization is only transient, and bacteria are cleared from deep organs before D15.

**Protection Conferred Against Bubonic and Pneumonic Forms of Plague**

To evaluate and compare the protective efficacy of V674pF1 and V674TnF1, mice were vaccinated and were infected one month later either intranasally (IN, pneumonic plague) or subcutaneously (SC, bubonic plague) with the fully virulent Y. pestis strain CO92 (4). For each infection route, two lethal challenges of CO92 were tested, with a moderate and a high dose of the fully virulent Y. pestis strain CO92.

Oral Vaccination

—Protection Against Pneumonic Plague:

A dose of 107 CFU of either V674pF1 or V674TnF1 strain did not confer full protection against a moderate IN challenge with Y. pestis (FIG. 6A).

In contrast, a dose of 108 CFU of either strain protected 100% of the animals against a similar challenge (FIG. 6A).

Since the 108 CFU dose was effective, a severe bacterial challenge was tested (FIG. 6B). Following this high challenge, only 80% of the mice vaccinated with V674pF1 survived, while all animals vaccinated with V674TnF1 survived.

Our results thus show the higher protective effect of V674TnF1 over V674pF1 and indicate that a single oral dose of V674TnF1 is sufficient to fully protect against pneumonic plague, even after exposure to high Y. pestis loads.

—Protection Against Bubonic Plague:

A single oral administration of 107 CFU of V674pF1 or V674TnF1 was not sufficient to obtain 100% protection against a moderate SC challenge with Y. pestis (FIG. 7A).

At a dose of 108 CFU, V674pF1 conferred 86% protection, while V674TnF1 protected 100% of the vaccinated mice (FIG. 7A).

When the challenge dose was increased to 10,000×LD50, a single oral administration of 108 CFU of V674TnF1 still protected 93% of the animals (FIG. 7B).

V674TnF1 is thus more effective than V674pF1 at protecting against bubonic plague.

Altogether, our results demonstrate that a single oral inoculation of 108 CFU of V674TnF1 is very efficient at vaccinating mice against both pneumonic and bubonic plague, even when the animals are challenged with very high doses of the fully virulent Y. pestis strain CO92.

Subcutaneous Vaccination

Since one of the 15 mice vaccinated with V674TnF1 did not survive after a severe SC challenge, we wondered whether it would be possible to increase even further the protection by using another route of vaccination.

—Protection Against Pneumonic Plague after SC Vaccination

To test the protective efficacy of an SC inoculation of V674TnF1, a single vaccine dose of 105 to 109 CFU was injected and the animals were challenged with a high IN inoculum (107 CFU=3,300×LD50) of Y. pestis CO92. Full protection was obtained with vaccine doses of 107 CFU and higher (FIG. 8).

—Protection Against Bubonic Plague after SC Vaccination

The protection conferred by a single SC injection of V674TnF1 (107 or 108 CFU) against bubonic plague (severe challenge: 10,000×LD50) was then evaluated.

A single vaccination with either dose protected 100% of the animals against a severe challenge dose (10,000×LD50) of Y. pestis CO92 administered SC (FIG. 9), indicating an efficiency even higher than that of the oral vaccination against bubonic plague.

## CONCLUSIONS

The V674TnF1 Y. pseudotuberculosis strain, in which the operon encoding the Y. pestis capsular antigen F1 has been inserted into the chromosome, is an efficient vaccine against both bubonic plague and pneumonic plague.

The V674TnF1 Y. pseudotuberculosis strain notably has the following advantages:


- - genetic stability: V674TnF1 is a *Y. pseudotuberculosis* strain,
    whose genome is much more stable than that of *Y. pestis;*
  - innocuity: V674TnF1 is highly attenuated, due to the irreversible
    deletion of three genes essential to distinct virulence mechanisms:
    adhesion (pH6 Ag/PsaA), iron capture (HPI), secretion of Yop toxins
    (YopK);
  - molecular diversity: as a live whole cell vaccine, it offers a high
    antigenic complexity, which guarantees a response against a broad
    range of antigenic targets; antigens are in their native form,
    adequately processed, and produced de novo as long as the bacteria
    persist;
  - easy manufacturing: once developed and validated, live vaccines do
    not require sophisticated equipments and techniques to be produced;
  - immunogenicity: adjuvant is not required, since bacterial antigens
    (LPS and other pathogen associated signatures) trigger the innate
    immune system; in addition to antigens common to *Y. pestis* and *Y.
    pseudotuberculosis*, V674TnF1 stably produces the F1 capsule, which
    is a major vaccine target against *Y. pestis;*
  - single dose administration: this is a major advantage as it greatly
    facilitates vaccination campaigns and allows a rapid protection;
  - vaccination possible by two routes: depending on the context, an SC
    or oral route of vaccination may be preferred.

Furthermore, V674TnF1 has very high vaccine efficacy. Animals vaccinated with V674TnF1 are fully protected against both bubonic and pneumonic plague, even when exposed to very high doses of the plague bacillus.

In contrast, V674pF1 achieves a lower vaccine efficacy, more particularly with respect to bubonic plague.

To our knowledge, the level of protection against bubonic and pneumonic plague conferred by a single dose of the V674TnF1 vaccine is one of the most, and probably the most efficient ever reported.

We further observed that V674TnF1 surprisingly is more rapidly cleared from the gut of the vaccinated animals than V674pF1, and that subcutaneous or oral administration of V674TnF1 are efficient route of administration depending on the intended use in prevention or urgent treatment.
