    "title": "Attachment and Detachment of Living Microorganisms Using a Potential-Controlled Electrode",
    "date": "2013-02-19",
    "abstract": "We developed an electrical modulation method for attachment and detachment of microorganisms. Living microorganisms suspended in non-nutritive media such as PBS\u207b and artificial seawater were attracted by and selectively attached to indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass electrode regions to which a negative potential was applied. The microorganisms suspended in LB medium and glucose solution were not attracted to the ITO electrode. Dead microorganisms were not attracted to the ITO electrode. The living microorganisms were retrieved after detachment from the ITO electrode by application of a high-frequency triangular wave potential. When we applied this method to separate microorganisms from deep-sea sediment, bacteria belonging to 19 phyla and 23 classes were collected without undesirable high molecular weight contaminants such as humic acids. At the phylum and class level, respectively, 95 and 87 % of the phylotypes among electrically retrieved bacteria were common to the gene clones from the direct sediment DNA extraction. This technique is a novel useful method to prepare bacterial cells in a single population or a community for metagenomic analyses.",

                "Microorganisms in soil and sediments are rich sources of novel therapeutic compounds such as antibiotics (Raaijmakers et al. 1997), anticancer agents (Shen et al. 2001), and immunosuppressants (Skoko et al. 2005), as well as a wide range of biotechnologically valuable products (Hatada et al. 2011; Ohta and Hatada 2006). However, the majority of microorganisms present in sediment and soil cannot be cultured under conventional laboratory conditions (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran 2008).",
                "Metagenomics has been developed over the past decade to clarify a previously unknown diversity of microorganisms on the one hand; on the other hand, it has been driven by the increasing biotechnological demand for novel enzymes and biomolecules (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran 2008; Simon and Daniel 2011). Analysis of DNA directly extracted from sediment and soil samples has paved the way to studying natural microbial communities without the need for cultivation. However, high DNA yields and purity are difficult to achieve due to the co-extraction of humic substances that inhibit downstream applications, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction enzyme digestion, and DNA ligation (Roh et al. 2006). In indirect DNA extraction methods, microorganisms are separated from the sediment and soil samples prior to cell lysis. Higher molecular weight and purer environmental DNA is obtained from indirect cell lysis compared with direct protocols (Courtois et al. 2001; Gabor et al. 2003; Roh et al. 2006). However, it was reported that the DNA obtained is usually derived from only about 25 to 35\u00a0% of the total number of microorganisms present in the soil and sediment samples (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran 2008). Various bacterial groups strongly attach to soil aggregates, which might bias the picture of the organization of the microbial community in the sample (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran 2008; Steffan et al. 1988).",
                "Microbial single-cell isolation techniques have also been developed during the past decade for three major purposes: (1) to cultivate previously uncultured microbes, (2) to assess and monitor cell physiology and function, and (3) to screen for novel microbiological products such as enzymes and antibiotics (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson 2004; Broude 2011; Ishii et al. 2010). Microbial single-cell isolation techniques fall into five major categories (Ishii et al. 2010). The first is the dilution-to-extinction method, which is probably the simplest method to obtain single cells from heterogeneous populations and involves serial dilutions of a sample solution until only single cells remain (Button et al. 1993; Schut et al. 1993). The second is micromanipulation, which obtains single cells using a mechanical micromanipulator or an optical tweezer (Fr\u00f6hlich and K\u00f6nig 2000; Huber et al. 2000; Ishii et al. 2010). The trapped cells are subsequently used for cultivation or other analyses. The third is flow cytometry, which enables the rapid analysis of entire cell populations on the basis of single cell characteristics (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson 2004). Multiple characteristics including cell count, cell size or content, and responses to fluorescent probes diagnostic of cell function may be collected simultaneously in this method (Brehm-Stecher and Johnson 2004). The fourth is microfluidics, which isolates and incubates single cells of interest using a number of microflow channels (Fu et al. 1999; Hu et al. 2005). The fifth is compartmentalization of single cells, which are screened for potentially novel enzymes and for cultivation of yet-uncultured microbes (Bergquist et al. 2009; Bershtein and Tawfik 2008; Ishii et al. 2010; Link et al. 2007). However, it is extremely difficult to use these five techniques for direct assay of various living microorganisms in soil and/or sediment samples. Because the microorganisms adhere strongly to soil aggregates, it is difficult to separate them alive from the aggregates (Rajendhran and Gunasekaran 2008; Steffan et al. 1988).",
                "In the present study, we demonstrated that a weak negative electric potential attracted living microorganisms to the electrode surface and that they were separated from sediment and soil particles. Furthermore, the electrically attached living microorganisms could be detached from the electrode by application of a high-frequency triangular wave potential. Using the electrical modulation technique, attachment and detachment of specifically positioned microorganisms can be modulated iteratively at the same positions on the electrode surface."

DNA marker used an all purpose Hi\u2013Lo DNA marker (Bionexus, Inc., Oakland, CA, USA). Genomic DNA of the electrically isolated microorganisms in the deep-sea sediment was extracted using the CTAB method.

                        "To examine whether the microorganisms were attracted by and attached to a reticulated ITO/glass electrode region with an applied potential (Fig.\u00a01), the gram-negative bacterium E. coli was used as a test microorganism. Cultured E. coli were washed with PBS(\u2212) and diluted to a concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/5\u00a0ml in PBS(\u2212) at RT and then poured into the three-electrode chambers on a glass slide (Fig.\u00a01). To analyze the respiratory activity of the microorganisms attached to the electrode, we used a Bacstain CTC rapid staining kit for microscopy. Cyano-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (CTC), a monotetrazolium redox dye that produces red fluorescent formazan when it is chemically or biologically reduced as in the presence of dehydrogenase activity, was used as an indicator of respiration (Frederiks et al. 2006; Hiraishi and Yoshida 2004). Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the fluorescent formazan was exclusively localized at the surface of individual cells and not at intracellular sites (Frederiks et al. 2006). Figure\u00a02a shows the distribution pattern of E. coli on the patterned ITO electrode after 24\u00a0h of constant potential applications. A constant potential between +0.6 and \u22120.6\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to the patterned ITO electrode in PBS(\u2212) for 24\u00a0h at RT. After the potential applications, living E. coli on the electrode was stained with CTC to determine respiratory activity, and red fluorescent formazan production was observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. Living E. coli was attracted by and selectively attached to the reticulated ITO electrode surface to which a negative potential between \u22120.3 and \u22120.5\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied (Fig.\u00a02a). A \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl constant potential application induced the maximum attachment of living E. coli to the reticulated ITO electrode region (Fig.\u00a02a). Although most microorganisms including E. coli strains have a negative zeta potential under neutral pH (Bayer and Sloyer 1990; Ebersole and McCormick 1993), few or no E. coli cells selectively attached to the ITO electrode region to which the positive potential was applied (Fig.\u00a02a). In addition, we investigated whether dead E. coli cells selectively attached to the ITO electrode region to which a negative potential was applied. The cultured E. coli cells were treated with 70\u00a0% EtOH for 1\u00a0h at 60\u00a0\u00b0C and replaced in PBS(\u2212) at RT. After fixation of the E. coli cells, \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl constant potential was applied to the patterned ITO electrode for 24\u00a0h at RT (Fig.\u00a02b). Few or no dead E. coli cells were observed on the ITO electrode region to which the \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied (Fig.\u00a02b). To clarify the interaction between living E. coli and the negative applied potential electrode, we examined whether the E. coli cells in glucose or PBS(\u2212) solutions and under aerobic or anaerobic conditions were attracted by and attached to the negative-potential electrode (Fig.\u00a02b, c). E. coli cells suspended in either 280\u00a0mM glucose solution or PBS(\u2212) were poured into the three-electrode chamber system. A \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied to the E. coli cells under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions for 24\u00a0h at RT. Figure\u00a02b, c shows the density of the E. coli cells attached to the electrode surface. In PBS(\u2212) conditions, \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential application enhanced the E. coli cell density on the reticulated ITO electrode region compared with the open circuit (Fig.\u00a02b, c). The attached E. coli cell density was increased by 46- and 68-fold compared with the open circuit under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively (Fig.\u00a02b, c). In contrast to the enhanced E. coli cell density in PBS(\u2212), no statistically significant differences between the \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential application and the open circuit were observed in 280\u00a0mM glucose under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (Fig.\u00a02b, c). Figure\u00a02 indicates that the principle of electrophoresis does not explain the phenomena of the negative potential-induced selective attachment of living E. coli to the reticulated ITO electrode region.Fig. 2Attachment of E. coli cells to the constant potential applied electrode. a Distribution patterns of E. coli cells on the constant potential applied patterned ITO electrodes in PBS(\u2212) for 24\u00a0h at RT.

                        "To perform accurate cell arrangement on the electrode surface, we examined whether E. coli cells recognized small regions of the negative applied potential microelectrode (Figs.\u00a01 and 3a, b). Figure\u00a03a, b shows living E. coli cells attached to small regions of the patterned ITO electrode to which \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied at RT in PBS(\u2212). We confirmed that a small number of E. coli cells selectively attached to the negative-potential 5-\u03bcm-diameter circular microelectrode array even if the electrode surface area was small compared with the reticulated electrode (Figs.\u00a01 and 3a). Few or no E. coli cells were attached to the SiO2 coating region of the microelectrode array (Figs.\u00a01 and 3a). The results in Fig.\u00a03a clearly show that electrical modulation of the spatial configuration of E. coli cells was successful using the patterned ITO electrode culture system. To investigate how E. coli cells attached to the negative applied potential ITO electrode region, we observed the cells on the patterned electrode using a confocal laser scanning microscope, an atomic force microscope (AFM), and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Figs.\u00a01 and 3). Figure\u00a03b, c shows optical microscopic and AFM images of the E. coli cells attached to the electrode regions. The E. coli cells that attached to the electrode surface (Fig.\u00a03c) had an elongated, short fibrous shape. We further examined the E. coli cells attached to the electrode surface using SEM (Fig.\u00a03d). Figure\u00a03d shows SEM images of E. coli cells on the negative applied potential electrode surface. E. coli cells appeared to adhere to the negative potential electrode surface with some elongated, short fibrous materials (Fig.\u00a03c, d).Fig. 3Fibrous elongated materials of E. coli cells attached to patterned ITO electrodes. a E. coli cells attached to 5-\u03bcm-diameter circular microelectrodes to which \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied in PBS(\u2212) for 15\u00a0h at RT. b E. coli cells attached to the JAMSTEC microelectrode to which \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied in PBS(\u2212) for 24\u00a0h at RT.

                        "We investigated whether a negative applied potential induced not only E. coli but also other microorganisms to attach to the reticulated ITO electrode. As test cells, we used one typical gram-positive bacterium, B. subtilis; two environmental bacteria, B. halodurans and S. oneidensis; one actinomycete, K. rosea; and one deep-sea bacterium, S. violacea. Figure\u00a04a shows the distribution pattern of B. subtilis, B. halodurans, K. rosea, S. violacea, and S. oneidensis on the patterned ITO electrode after 24\u00a0h of constant potential application. They were attracted by and selectively attached to the reticulated ITO electrode surface to which a negative potential was applied (Fig.\u00a04a). Except for S. violacea, \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential induced the maximum attachment of these organisms to the reticulated ITO electrode region (Fig.\u00a04a). A \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl or lower applied potential in artificial seawater induced an adsorption wave of positive ions to the electrode surface, and the maximum attachment of S. violacea occurred a \u22120.3\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential (Figs.\u00a04a and 5). Figure\u00a04b shows SEM images of B. subtilis, B. halodurans, K. rosea, S. violacea, and S. oneidensis on the reticulated ITO electrode region. All five microorganisms also produced short fibrous materials that were very similar in both form and size to those of E. coli and attached to the negative applied potential electrode region (Figs.\u00a03d and 4b).Fig. 4A negative potential attracted cultured and soil microorganisms to the patterned ITO electrode. a B. halodurans, B. subtilis, S. oneidensis, and K. rosea attached to the patterned ITO electrode to which \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied for 24\u00a0h in PBS(\u2212) at RT.

                        "Next, we examined whether microorganisms in soil were attracted by the negative applied potential electrode in various types of solution (Figs.\u00a04c and 5). Garden soil samples were suspended in either PBS(\u2212), MOPS buffer, tricine buffer, or LB medium and placed in the three-electrode chamber system. A \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was then applied to the soil samples in the various solutions for 24\u00a0h at RT. Figure\u00a04c shows the distribution pattern of the soil microorganisms on the negative applied potential electrode surface. The soil microorganisms in each of the non-nutritive buffers such as PBS(\u2212), MOPS buffer, and tricine buffer selectively attached to the reticulated ITO electrode region to which the \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied (Fig.\u00a04c). The characteristic features of constant potential application that induced soil microorganism attachment were nearly identical to those that induced E. coli attachment (Figs.\u00a02a and 5). The soil microorganisms in PBS(\u2212) were attracted by and selectively attached to the reticulated ITO electrode surface to which a negative potential of between \u22120.2 and \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied (Fig.\u00a05). The maximum attachment of soil microorganisms was observed at \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential (Fig.\u00a05). In artificial seawater, the maximum attachment of soil microorganisms was shifted to \u22120.3\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl because the adsorption wave of positive ions occurred at \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl on the electrode surface (Fig.\u00a05). Meanwhile, few soil microorganisms in LB medium attached to the ITO electrode region to which \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential was applied (Fig.\u00a04c). When the microorganisms in LB medium were examined in the cell viability test, it was confirmed that \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential was nearly non-cytotoxic, and 92\u00a0% (118 of 128 cells) of the soil bacteria remained alive on the electrode surface 24\u00a0h after the potential application (Fig.\u00a04c). Figure\u00a04d shows the time course of garden soil microorganism attachment in PBS(\u2212) to the reticulated ITO electrode region. The \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl applied potential induced microorganism attachment that increased in a linear fashion until 16\u00a0h, after which the cell attachment rate became sluggish (Fig.\u00a04d). The results in Figs.\u00a02, 4, and 5 indicate that the microorganisms can attach to the electrode with a negative applied potential when the cells are suspended in non-nutritive media such as PBS(\u2212), MOPS buffer, tricine buffer, and artificial seawater."

                        "After negative potential application in non-nutritive solutions for 24\u00a0h, almost none of the soil microorganisms attached to the electrode surface could be detached by scraping several times with a rubber cell scraper. Therefore, we examined the electrical detachment and retrieval methods. In our previous study, we succeeded in detaching animal cells from an ITO electrode surface treated with extracellular matrix proteins after application of \u00b110\u00a0mV vs. Ag/AgCl 9-MHz triangular wave potential in PBS(\u2212) for 30\u201360\u00a0min (Koyama 2011). Triangular wave potential-induced animal cell detachment is almost completely non-cytotoxic, and no statistically significant differences in HeLa cell growth were observed after they were subjected to trypsinization and high-frequency wave potential application (Koyama 2011). Therefore, we investigated whether high-frequency triangular wave potential application also induced the detachment of microorganisms from the ITO electrode surface. Figure\u00a06a shows the electrical detachment of soil microorganisms, E. coli, and B. subtilis from the patterned ITO electrode. After the negative potential induced microorganism attachment and the electrode surface was washed with PBS(\u2212), \u00b110-mV vs. Ag/AgCl 9-MHz triangular wave potential was applied to the microorganisms on the ITO electrode in fresh PBS(\u2212) for 60\u00a0min at RT. High-frequency triangular wave potential induced detachment of soil microorganisms, E. coli, and B. subtilis from the ITO electrode after 60\u00a0min of application (Fig.\u00a06a). Figure\u00a06b shows the time course of soil microorganism detachment from the reticulated ITO electrode region. Only PBS(\u2212) treatment for 60\u00a0min did not detach the microorganisms from the electrode surface (Fig.\u00a06b). A \u00b110-mV vs. Ag/AgCl 9-MHz triangular wave potential detached 66\u00a0% of the soil microorganisms after 30\u00a0min of application, and almost all of the microorganisms were detached after 60\u00a0min of application (Fig.\u00a06b). Under the experimental conditions shown in Fig.\u00a06, we collected 3.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 cells/g (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/50\u00a0\u03bcg) of living microorganisms from the total 4.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 cells/g in the garden soil sample. Table\u00a01 shows the viability of the microorganisms after high-frequency triangular wave potential application. The application of \u00b110, \u00b16, and \u00b14\u00a0mV vs. Ag/AgCl 9-MHz triangular wave potential detached more than 98\u00a0% of the microorganisms on the electrode surface after 60\u00a0min in PBS(\u2212) at RT (Table\u00a01). To examine the cytotoxicity of electrical detachment using the high-frequency triangular wave potential, we measured the survival rates of the residual microorganisms on the electrode surface after 60\u00a0min of application. High and low survival rates were 91\u00a0% (517 of 566 cells) and 17\u00a0% (120 of 726 cells) of soil microorganisms after \u00b110 and \u00b18\u00a0mV 9-MHz triangular wave potential application, respectively (Table\u00a01). After \u00b18\u00a0mV triangular wave potential application for 60\u00a0min, a large portion of the remaining microorganisms on the electrode surface was comprised of dead cells, and the detachment rate was lower than under the other experimental conditions (Table\u00a01). In the cultured microorganisms, 83\u00a0% (283 of 342 cells) of the E. coli and 47\u00a0% (243 of 522 cells) of the B. subtilis cells remained alive after 60\u00a0min of application (Table\u00a01). We also examined the viable bacteria collection rates of E. coli and B. subtilis by colony counting in the supernatants in the three-electrode chamber system (Table\u00a01). We collected the supernatants of both after 24\u00a0h of application of the \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl potential and after 1\u00a0h of application of the high-frequency triangular wave potential. The viable bacteria collection rate was calculated from the colony number after high-frequency triangular wave potential application divided by the total colony number. The viable bacteria collection rates indicated similar survival rates (Table\u00a01). We successfully recovered 88\u00a0% (238 of 272 colony-forming units (CFU)) of E. coli and 48\u00a0% (157 of 328\u00a0CFU) of B. subtilis from the cell suspensions using the electrical attachment and detachment techniques (Table\u00a01).Fig. 6Electrical detachment of microorganisms. a Photographs of electrically detached soil microorganisms, E. coli, and B. subtilis. b Time course of soil microorganism detachment from the ITO electrode.

                        "To determine which types of microorganism would attach to the electrode surface with a negative potential applied, we used a deep-sea sediment sample collected at a depth of 1,176\u00a0m in the seep area of Sagami Bay, Japan (Koyama and Aizawa 2000; Koyama et al. 2005). The microbial flora composition of the microorganisms electrically retrieved from the sediment samples was compared with that of the original sample by phylotype analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes (Figs.\u00a07 and 8). In the garden soil sample, no PCR amplicon was obtained from the DNA directly extracted from the soil sample (Fig.\u00a07). The PCR may be inhibited by humic substances in the soil (Roh et al. 2006), and therefore the microbial flora in the electrically retrieved garden soil microorganisms and DNA directly extracted from the soil sample could not be compared (Fig.\u00a07). Figure\u00a07a shows the method used for electrical retrieval of microorganisms from the deep-sea sediment samples for phylogenetic analyses. To determine the microbial composition from the sediment sample, the electrical retrieval of microorganisms was performed twice using the large electrode chamber devices (Fig.\u00a07a). Moreover, both the constant and high-frequency triangular potential application times were shortened (Fig.\u00a07a). After the procedures shown in Fig.\u00a07a, we obtained 1.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 microorganisms from the 5-g deep-sea sediment sample. Figure\u00a08 compares the microbial community structure of the deep-sea sediment after electrical retrieval method and direct sediment DNA extraction. Deep-sea microorganisms belonging to 19 phyla and 23 classes were obtained using the electrical retrieval method (Fig.\u00a08). The majority of the retrieved clones obtained with the electrical retrieval method were affiliated with Proteobacteria (Fig.\u00a08). The remaining phyla were affiliated with Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, Lentisphaerae, Spirochaetes, Candidate division BRC1, OP11, OP3, OD1, WS3, TG-1, Chlorobi, and TA06 groups (Fig.\u00a08). At the phylum level 95\u00a0% and at the class level 87\u00a0% of the phylotypes among electrically retrieved bacteria were common to the gene clones from the direct sediment DNA extraction (Fig.\u00a08). The results in Fig.\u00a08 indicate that the electrical retrieval method collected a broad range of living microorganisms, which may reflect the organization of the microbial community in the sediment sample.Fig. 7Electrical retrieval method for soil or sediment microorganisms. a Schematic illustration of the electrical retrieval method for soil or sediment microorganisms. b PCR products from the garden soil samples before purification of phylogenetic analyses.

                "In this study, we demonstrated that an extensive range of living bacteria attached to the electrode surface with a negative applied potential in non-nutritive media. This result was supported by the E. coli attachment results (Fig.\u00a02); the AFM and SEM images of E. coli (Fig.\u00a03); the B. subtilis, B. halodurans, K. rosea, S. violacea, S. oneidensis, and soil microorganism attachment results (Figs.\u00a04 and 5); and the determination of the deep-sea microbial community structure (Fig.\u00a08). Nineteen phyla and 23 classes of microorganisms in deep-sea sediment samples were collected using the electrical attachment and detachment methods (Fig.\u00a08). The electrical retrieval method collected almost all of the bacterial phylotypes detected using the direct DNA extraction method (Fig.\u00a08). Furthermore, the electrical modulation of the spatial configuration of E. coli cells was also successful using ITO microelectrodes (Fig.\u00a03). These techniques hold potential for novel microbial metagenomic analyses.",
                "The results in Figs.\u00a02, 3, 4, and 8 suggest that the ITO electrode region with a negative applied potential acts as an energy source for a broad range of microorganisms. It appears that microorganisms such as E. coli, B. subtilis, B. halodurans, K. rosea, S. violacea, and S. oneidensis produce adherent short fibrous materials in response to contact with the electrode surface with a negative applied potential (Figs.\u00a02, 3, and 4). We observed a weak electrical current of \u22120.19 to \u22120.88\u00a0\u03bcA/cm2 when a negative constant potential between \u22120.3- and \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied to cultured microorganisms and soil and sediment samples. The pili of Geobacter sulfurreducens may serve as biological nanowires, transferring electrons from the cell surface to the surface of Fe(III) oxides (Reguera et al. 2005). S. oneidensis nanowires were found to be electrically conductive along micrometer-length scales, with a measured resistivity on the order of 1 \u03a9\u2009cm (El-Naggar et al. 2010). Electron donors are often called energy sources because energy is released when they are oxidized (Madigan and Martinko 2006). Therefore, an electrode with a negative applied potential per se may act as an electron donor that is available for a variety of microorganisms. If the electrode acts as an electron donor in PBS(\u2212), oxygen would be an electron acceptor (Fig.\u00a02). Under anaerobic and PBS(\u2212) conditions, the maximum attached E. coli cell density was increased (Fig.\u00a02b, c). To obtain the anaerobic conditions, we used the anaerobic cultivation system that maintained 5\u00a0% carbon dioxide and less than 1\u00a0% oxygen concentrations after 60\u00a0min of cultivation. Although the E. coli cell density was enhanced in PBS(\u2212), no statistically significant differences between the \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl application and the open circuit were observed in 280\u00a0mM glucose under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig.\u00a02b, c). Therefore, the microorganisms attached on the negative potential applied electrode surface might synthesize a part of microbial components from carbon dioxide. The \u22120.3 and \u22120.4\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl negative potentials correspond to \u22120.1 and \u22120.2\u00a0V of reduction potentials (E 0\u2032), respectively. If the microorganisms on the negative potential applied electrode induce carbon dioxide fixation, energy supply of ATP molecules would be needed for the fixation reactions because of the low reduction potentials of the electrode (Madigan and Martinko 2006). Further research will determine the mechanisms on how the negative potential induced a wide range of the microorganism attachments. The electrical retrieval method could be used not only for microorganism extraction from soil and sediment samples but also for symbiotic bacteria extraction from biological samples. The electrical modulation method would also expand applications of the microbial battery and sensor in diverse ways.",
                "In our previous study using animal cells, we found that \u00b110-mV vs. Ag/AgCl 9-MHz triangular wave potential induced detachment of both animal cells and extracellular matrix proteins (Koyama 2011). The mechanism of detachment involved both oscillation of the negative zeta potential-charged animal cells and the insertion of water molecules between the electrode surface and extracellular matrix proteins resulting from increments in hydrophilicity on the electrode surface (Koyama 2011). Because the triangular wave potential oscillated and detached the negative zeta potential-charged cells, potential application of optimal wave shape, optimal resonance frequency, and optimal amplitude in each phylotype of microorganism would shorten the time to detachment and retrieval of living microorganisms from the electrode (Fig.\u00a06; Table\u00a01)."
