    "abstract": "An object of the present invention is to prepare individual microorganisms or a microflora composition derived from land or seafloor soil in which contamination of land or seafloor soil-derived substances is reduced. The present invention provides [1] a method for preparing, from a land or a seafloor solid samples, microorganisms containing a reduced level of land or seafloor soil-derived substances that inhibit nucleic acid analysis, which comprises (1) the step of disposing a suspension of a land or seafloor soil sample containing microorganisms and land or seafloor soil-derived substance that inhibit nucleic acid analysis as an electrolyte on a surface of a substrate at least a part of which constitutes an electrode, and applying a constant potential to the electrode to attach at least a part of the microorganisms to the surface of the substrate, and (2) the step of applying a high-frequency wave potential to the electrode to detach the microorganisms attached to the surface of the substrate in a viable state, and wherein the constant potential applied in the step (1) is greater than \u22120.5 V but not greater than \u22120.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), or greater than +0.2 V but not greater than +0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), and the high-frequency wave potential applied in the step (2) has a frequency in the range of from 1 kHz to 20 MHz, and a potential range of \u00b10.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) or smaller.",

The constant potential applied in the step (1) is greater than \u22120.5 V but not greater than \u22120.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), or greater than +0.2 V but not greater than +0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). As is specifically indicated in Examples, when the constant potential that is applied to the electrode to which the microorganisms are attached falls within the above range, the microorganisms in the electrolyte specifically attach to the electrode in a viable state. When the constant potential applied to the electrode falls outside the above range, the microorganisms either do not attach to the electrode, or they attach to the electrode, but not in a viable state. The above constant potential has been denoted by an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, but can also be denoted using a reference electrode other than Ag/AgCl. It should be understood that even though a constant potential denoted using a reference electrode other than Ag/AgCl does not fall within the above range, but the constant potential denoted using an Ag/AgCl reference electrode falls within the above range, the constant potential satisfies the requirement of the present invention. When denoted using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, \u22121.06 V is the hydrogen generation potential, and +1.69 V is the oxygen generation potential.",
                                "The application period of the constant potential to the electrode can be appropriately determined by taking into account the type of microorganism, the type of electrolyte, the density of the microorganism in the electrolyte, the potential being applied, and the like. For example, it can fall within the range of 1 to 48 hours.",
                                "The electrolyte used in the step (1) does not contain a source of nutrition for the microorganisms. Attachment of the microorganisms to the surface of the substrate by the application of the constant potential only occurs when the electrolyte does not contain a source of nutrition for the microorganisms contained in the electrolyte. Although the reason is unclear, the microorganisms do not attach to the electrode when the electrolyte contains a source of nutrition for the microorganisms contained in the electrolyte. The term \u201csource of nutrition for the microorganisms\u201d means a source of nutrition that is essential for cultivation of the microorganism, and consists of some or all of components of a medium, that is normally used to cultivate microorganisms. More specifically, the source of nutrition that is not contained in the electrolyte means, for example, sugars, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, nucleic acid, and the like.",

In the course of preparing the electrolyte containing microorganisms from a sample containing the microorganisms, mixing the original electrolyte solution with the sample without removing the trace quantities of sources of nutrition contained in the sample causes them to be passed on to the electrolyte to which the potential is applied. Such an electrolyte containing trace quantities of sources of nutrition falls within the scope of the electrolyte \u201cthat does not contain sources of nutrition\u201d defined in the present invention. Although the sample containing the microorganisms can be mixed with the original solution of the electrolyte to prepare the electrolyte, it is possible to filter or the like the sample contain the microorganisms to remove the trace quantities of sources of nutrition contain in the sample, and then mix the sample with the original solution of the electrolyte to reduce the quantity of sources of nutrition passed on with the sample.",
                                "The density of the microorganism in the electrolyte is not particularly limited. For example, when the microorganisms are attached to the surface of the electrode call by cell, the density of the microorganisms in the electrolyte is desirably relatively low. However, since the quantity of microorganisms to be attached to the electrode varies depending on the constant potential applied and with the application period of the constant potential, the density of the microorganism in the electrolyte is one of a number of variables. The density of the microorganism in the electrolyte can be appropriately determined taking these factors into consideration.",

The salt concentration desirably falls within the range of 10 to 10 g/L. Further, it is desirable for the electrolyte used in the step (1) to be buffer solution from the viewpoint of attaching the microorganisms to the electrode in a viable state. It is also desirable for the salt concentration in the buffer solution to be 10 g/L or lower. The buffer solution is not particularly limited. For example, a phosphate buffer solution (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) is desirable from the viewpoint of attaching the microorganisms to the electrode in a viable state. In addition to a phosphate buffer solution, it is also possible to employ 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), n-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine (tricine), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N\u2032-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES), and the like. However, from the viewpoint of increasing the rate of attachment of the microorganism to the electrode, a phosphate buffer solution (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free) is desirable. The pH of the buffer solution can be appropriately selected on the basis of the type of microorganism. For example, it will fall within the range of 5 to 9 for usual microorganisms.",

In these cases, the constant potential applied in the step (1) is desirably greater than \u22120.4 V but not greater than \u22120.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), or greater than +0.2 V but not greater than +0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The salt concentration in the case of artificial seawater or natural seawater is about 40 to 50 g/L. When the salt concentration is high, with a constant potential in the range of \u22120.5 V to \u22120.4 V, the survival rate of the microorganisms attached to the electrode tends to decrease.",

As disclosed in Example, E. coli, which is a Gram-positive bacterium, and B. subtilis, which is a Gram-negative bacterium, can be attached to the surface of the electrode in a viable state. Examples of the microorganism that can be attached to the electrode surface in a viable state include, but not limited to, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Shewanella violacea, Shewanella oneidensis, Shewanella surugensis, Kocuria rosea, Kocuria 4B, Shewanella abyssi, Shewanella kaireitica, and the like.",

As a result, it was confirmed that S. violacea was strongly drawn onto an electrode to which a constant potential of \u22120.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied in artificial seawater, and the other microorganisms were strongly drawn onto electrodes to which a constant potential of \u22120.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied in a phosphate buffer solution (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free), like Escherichia coli."

The microorganisms that have been attached to the electrode and the microorganisms that have attached to a non-electrode surface in the vicinity of the electrode are detached by the application of a high-frequency wave potential. Specifically, the high-frequency wave potential has a frequency falling within the range of 1 KHz to 20 MHz, desirably within the range of 1 to 15 MHz. The potential has, for example, a range of \u00b10.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) or smaller, such as \u00b110 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) or smaller, \u00b19 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) or smaller, or \u00b18 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) or smaller.

The distance from the electrode of the microorganisms that can be detached on the non-electrode surface depends on the potential and frequency of the high-frequency wave potential. However, it can be about 100 \u03bcm or smaller. At the time of applying a high-frequency wave potential, the potential is directly applied o the microorganisms on the electrode and indirectly applied to the microorganisms on the non-electrode surface. Accordingly, there is relatively less stress due to the application of the potential on the microorganisms on the non-electrode surface, and even when damage is inflicted to the microorganisms by the application of the potential (due to the conditions of the high-frequency wave potential), there will tend to be less, or no, damage to the microorganisms on the non-electrode surface. Such an intense high-frequency wave potential that inflicts damage on the microorganisms when applied may sometimes be used because the microorganisms sometimes attach strongly and cannot be readily detached. In such cases, an electrode shape or disposition, or non-electrode surface that allows preferential detachment of the microorganisms on the non-electrode surface can be selected to actively detach the microorganisms on the non-electrode surface.",
