                        "A process for modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series using a non-stationary model is described further herein. The statistics literature contains several related concepts of (non-)stationarity for time series, with weak and strong stationarity being the most widely used ones. Common to these variants of (non-)stationarity is that they are defined in terms of a stochastic process' joint distribution. For example, given a discrete time series {yt \u2208}t and any subset of time stamps {t1, t2, . . . , tk}, the time series may be considered strongly stationary if \u2200\u03c4\u2208:p(yt,yt, . . . , yt) p(yt+\u03c4, yt+\u03c4, . . . , yt+\u03c4).",
                        "While non-stationarity with respect to a stochastic process' joint distribution is important in areas like statistics and econometrics, temporal forecasting relies more heavily on the properties of a time-series' conditional distribution p(yt|yt\u2212B:t\u22121, xt\u2212B:t), where yt\u2212B:t\u22121=(yt\u2212B, y2, . . . , yt\u22121) and B is the bounded history size of yt and can be arbitrarily large. xt \u2208RQ and contains auxiliary information. In general, this conditional distribution could vary significantly across time t as new evidence makes its way into the set of conditioning variable. Many existing models reduce the resulting complexity by making explicit conditional independence assumptions in the form of a bounded context window, e.g., an autoregressive model.",
                        "Examining popular time series models through the lens of this conditional distribution, on one end of the spectrum are simple auto-regressive (AR) models of order p, which make the time-invariant assumption p(yt|y1:t\u22121)=p(yt|yt\u2212p:t\u22121); and on the other end of the spectrum are various forms of latent variable models, such as state-space models (SSMs) and, more recently, deep learning models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While the latter have the capability to directly model conditional distributions p(yt|y1:t\u22121) with a growing number of conditioning variables, they usually make their own time-invariance assumptions, such as the recursive structure of the underlying dynamics. As a result, they do not respond well to time-variant changes in the conditional distribution, because (1) the model needs to be highly sensitive to the provided context, which increases the capacitive burden; and (2) the model cannot fully rely on the learned contextual relations, because the conditional distribution of the underlying ground truth process undergoes continual change.",
                        "The time-series forecasting described herein is able to provide modeling of non-stationary conditional distributions of time series. The forecasting uses a clean decoupling of the time-variant (non-stationary) part and the time-invariant (stationary) part of the distribution of the time series. The time-invariant part models a stationary conditional distribution, given some control variables, while the time-variant part only focuses on modeling the changes in this conditional distribution over time through those control variables. Using this separation, a flexible time-invariant conditional model is provided and inferences about how the model changes over time can be made efficiently. At test time or when used for forecasting, the model takes both the uncertainty of the conditional distribution as well as the non-stationarity into account when making predictions and adapts to the changes in the conditional distribution over time in an online manner. The modeling described herein is based on a Bayesian dynamic model that can adapt to conditional distribution changes and a deep conditional distribution model that can scale to large multivariate time series. The experiment results show that the model can adapt to non-stationary time series better than state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.",

In the results lower values indicate better performance.",

For univariate data, the full model (DynaConF) outperforms its ablated counterpart (StatiConF) by 2.0%-12.3%, validating the importance of the dynamic adaptation to non-stationary effects. DynaConF\u2014PP is also superior to all univariate baselines, with its closest competitor DeepAR\u201410 behind by an average of 6.1%. Furthermore, it is noted that the DynaConF model with the pointwise encoder tends to outperform the MLP encoder, both for the ablated and full model. For multivariate data similar trends were observed. Here, the full model (DynaConF\u2014PP) performs 24.3% (CRPS) better than the ablated model with static conditional distribution (StatiConF\u2014PP) and 22.6% (CRPS) better than the best-performing baseline (DeepVAR\u2014160). As before, pointwise encoders tend to perform better than MLP encoders.

Note that because the encoder in the current model is non-linear, the inferred \u03d5t does not necessarily correspond to the original parameter. However, it can clearly be seen how it differs for Sin (continuous changes) vs Flip/Dynamic (discrete jumps) and how it tracks the ground-truth up to scale/sign.

For the current method, first the StatiConF model was trained and then its learned encoder was reused in DynaConF, so the learning of DynaConF is focused on the dynamic model. The models use a two-layer LSTM with 128 hidden units as the encoder, except for the 8-dimensional Exchange data, where the hidden size is 8. Again it is noted that, different from DeepVAR or LSTM-MAF, LSTM as an encoder of (yt\u2212B:t1, xt\u2212B,t) only so that it is restarted at every time step.",

After training StatiConF, its encoders are reused in DynaConF, so it only needs to learn the dynamic model. For DynaConF, the same validation set is used to choose the number of training epochs and use 0.01 as the fixed learning rate.",
                        "For the models, Adam is used as the optimizer with the default learning rate of 0.001 unless the learning rate is chosen using the validation set. The dimension of the latent vector zt,i is set to E=4 across all the experiments.",

Specifically, for all datasets, the mean and standard deviation are used to shift and scale each dimension of the time series. For Exchange, the mean and standard deviation of the recent past data are used in a moving context window. For the other datasets, the global mean and standard deviation of each dimension computed using the whole training set is used. In all cases, for forecasting, the output from the model is inversely scaled and shifted back for evaluation. These design choices were made based on the performance on the validation sets.",
                        "For real datasets, extreme values or outliers may cause instability during training. Winsorization is optionally applied using the quantiles (0.025 and 0.975) computed from the recent past data in a moving context window on Traffic and Wikipedia, based on the results on the validation sets.",
                        "Table 4 depicts the results. As can be seen, for different datasets and different evaluation metrics, the relative performance of each method can be different. This shows the diversity of these datasets and that different models may benefit from dataset-specific structure in different ways. However, DynaConF achieves the best performance more often than all the other baselines. Where it does not outperform, its performance is competitive consistently, unlike the baselines, whose relative performance (compared to others) varies significantly across datasets. It is also noted that the full model, DynaConF, which adapts to changes in the conditional distribution consistently outperforms the ablated model, StatiConF, which only models a static conditional distribution, except for electricity, where the performance is similar. This shows the effectiveness of modeling the dynamic changes in the conditional distribution.",

                        "The DynaConF model shows much better performance compared to the baseline models. It is noted that the test time periods have drastic changes in the conditional distributions, which the DynaConF handles well. It can be seen from the experimental results that when the conditional distribution of the time series remains stable, DynaConF can perform competitively compared to baselines that do not explicitly model conditional distribution changes, however, when the conditional distribution changes, the DynaConF model can provide a significant improvement over other models.",

The forecasting may be applied to a number of different applications and data types, including, for example electricity usage, exchange rates, traffic patterns, solar, taxi, Wikipedia among others. As described above, the models may be trained on existing datasets and then the trained models may be used to forecast or predict the time series in the future. The forecast or predictions may then be used by downstream applications for example in determining actions to perform, determining how to control systems or devices, determining or informing decisions as well as other applications. In addition to providing a model for forecasting time-series data that can scale efficiently with large datasets, the model provides improved forecasting results by decoupling the time-series data into the time-variant portion and the time-invariant portion.",
