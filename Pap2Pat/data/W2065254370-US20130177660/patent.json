Based on these in vitro findings, several HDACi are currently being tested in clinical trials and one such inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been approved by FDA for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treatment (Non Patent Literature 4 and 5). HDACi have also shown synergistic or additive effects with a wide variety of anti-cancer reagents (Non Patent Literature 2 and 4). In addition, it is known that cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, etoposide, 5-FU, and doxorubicin, is achieved in part by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Non Patent Literature 6 to 9). Consistent with these findings, alteration of antioxidant and its related gene expression modulate the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs probably through its ROS scavenging ability (Non Patent Literature 10 to 13). This fact supports the findings that the induction of ROS by the chemotherapeutic drugs is important for cytotoxicity."

                                "To date, it has been revealed that HDACi changes the expression of Thioredoxin and TBP-2 regulating an oxidation state in cells. From the viewpoint of this fact, the present inventors have made a hypothesis that HDACi regulates the antioxidation mechanism in cells, thereby allowing cancer cells to be sensitive to an anticancer drug. In order to verify the hypothesis, the present inventors have focused on HDAC1 and RFP (RET finger protein) and keenly investigated. HDAC1 has characteristics that: (1) it is found to be highly expressed in human tumors, and (2) it regulates proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells (Halkidou K, Gaughan L, Cook S, Leung H Y, Neal D E, Robson C N. (2004). Upregulation and nuclear recruitment of HDAC1 in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Prostate 59: 177-189 (Non-patent Document 14); Glozak M A, Seto E. (2007). Histone deacetylases and cancer. Oncogene 26: 5420-5432 (Non-patent Document 15)). RFP has characteristics that: (1) it is highly expressed in a cancer cell line; (2) its expression in a living body is localized (Takahashi M, Inaguma Y, Hiai H, Hirose F. (1988). Developmentally regulated expression of a human \u201cfinger\u201d-containing gene encoded by the 5\u2032 half of the ret transforming gene. Mol Cell Biol, 4:1853-6 (Non-patent Document 16); Tezel, G. et al. M. (1999). Different nuclear/cytoplasmic distributions of RET finger protein in different cell types. Pathol. Int. 49: 881-886 (Non-patent Document 17)); and (3) its knockout mouse does not exhibit a phenotype of serious conditions (unpublished data). As a result, it has been revealed that HDAC1 downregulates the expression of Thioredoxin Binding Protein-2 (TBP-2), thereby accelerating the resistance of cancer cells to oxidative stress. Furthermore, it has been found that HDAC1 is recruited to a promoter of a TBP-2 gene by a protein complex composed of RFP and a transcription factor NF-Y. Furthermore, the suppression of expression of REP using RNAi causes disintegration of the protein complex, resulting in remarkably increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin (which is also an anticancer drug, an oxidative stress inducer). These facts mean that RFP is an important regulation factor that allows cancer cells to gain resistance to an anticancer drug, and suggest that suppression of the expression or the function of RFP enhances the action of an anticancer drug to thus improve clinical outcomes of cancer therapy.",
                                "On the other hand, it has been revealed that high expression of RFP correlates to the decrease in the expression of TBP-2 in human colon carcinoma or poor prognosis in colon carcinoma patients. This supports the effectiveness of treatment strategy of suppressing the expression or the function of RFP when anticancer drugs are used, and means that the resistance to anticancer drugs can be determined by examining the expression level of RFP in cancer cells and the determination results are useful information that contributes to determining treatment policies (selection of effective treatment method, and the like), making prognosis better, and improving the quality of life (QOL) of patients. As a result of a further investigation, it has been revealed that RFP expression correlates with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer patients. Interestingly, findings have been obtained: when high expression of RFP is observed, employing more aggressive operations leads to the improvement of prognosis. As mentioned above, it is shown that RFP is useful as a biomarker (indicator) for estimating prognosis in cancer patients. In particular, in endometrial cancer, it is suggested that RFP expression is a useful indicator in determining an operative method.",

The sequence of a RFP gene (SEQ ID NO: 1), the sequence of mRNA of RFP (SEQ ID NO: 2), and the amino acid sequence of RFP (SEQ ID NO: 3) are shown in the Sequence List. As mentioned above, since the knockout mouse targeting RFP does not show a phenotype of serious conditions, targeting RFP is preferable from the viewpoint of safety. Furthermore, since high expression is observed in a plurality of types of human tumors or cultured cell lines derived from most of the examined tumors (unpublished data and Non-patent Document 16), it is expected that the action can be exhibited in wide range of tumors.",

In other words, an agent of the present invention including the compound of the above-mentioned (a) or (b) as an active ingredient can suppress expression of RFP by RNAi. RNAi is a process of a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene suppression that can be induced in the eukaryote. For RNAi with respect to mammalian cells, short double strand RNA (siRNA) of the sequence corresponding to the sequence of the target mRNA is used. In general, the siRNA has 21 to 23 base pairs. It is known that mammalian cells have two routes (a sequence-specific route and a sequence-nonspecific route) affected by double strand RNA (dsRNA). In the sequence-specific route, relatively long dsRNA is divided into short interference RNAs (i.e., siRNAs). On the other hand, it is thought that a sequence-nonspecific route can be elicited by arbitrary dsRNA regardless of the sequence as long as it has a predetermined length or longer. In this route, dsRNA activates two enzymes, that is, PKR, which becomes an active form and stops all synthesis of proteins by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2, and 2\u2032,5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase, which is involved in the synthesis of an RNAase L activated molecule. In order to minimize the advance of this nonspecific route, it is preferable to use double strand RNA (siRNA) including shorter than about 30 base pairs (see, for example, Hunter et al. (1975) J Biol Chem 250: 409-17; Manche et al. (1992) Mol Cell Biol 12: 5239-48; Minks et al. (1979) J Biol Chem 254: 10180-3; and Elbashir et al. (2001) Nature 411: 494-8).",

In the case where the expression inhibition by the antisense method is carried out, for example, when transcription is carried out in the target cell, an antisense construct for generating RNA that is complementary to a portion specific to mRNA encoding RFP is used. Such an antisense construct is introduced into the target cell, for example, in a form of an expression plasmid. On the other hand, when it is introduced into the target cell as the antisense construct, it is possible to employ an oligonucleotide probe that is hybridized with mRNA or genome DNA sequence encoding RFP and inhibits the expression thereof.

                                "As a result of investigation by the present inventors, it has been revealed that high expression of RFP correlates to the reduction of expression of TBP-2 in a human colon carcinoma, and poor prognosis in a patient with colon carcinoma (see the below-mentioned Examples). Based on the findings, a second aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for testing the resistance to an anticancer drug using the expression amount of a RFP gene (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cthe testing method of the present invention\u201d). The testing method of the present invention allows determining the resistance of cancer cells to an anticancer drug. The determination results can be used for determining, for example, treatment policies (selection of an effective treatment method, and the like). The use of the determination results improves clinical outcomes of therapy, makes prognosis better, improves quality of life (QOL) of patients, and the like. Thus, the testing method of the present invention provides information extremely useful for cancer treatment.",
                                "The testing method of the present invention includes the following steps: a step of examining an expression amount of RFP in cancer cells separated from a living body (detection step); and a step of determining resistance of the cancer cells to an anticancer drug having an oxidative stress-inducing ability based on the results of the above-mentioned step (determination step).",
                                "In the detection step, firstly, cancer cells separated from a living body are prepared. The term \u201cseparated from a living body\u201d refers to a state in which a part of the living tissue including cancer cells to be tested is extracted and thereby cancer cells to be tested are completely isolated from the living body as the origin of the cancer cells. As long as this condition is satisfied, cancer cells may be in a state in which they form tissue together with the surrounding cells (that is, in a state of a tissue piece) or may be in a state in which they are separated from the surrounding cells. In the former case, cells may be prepared in such a manner that, for example, biopsy histological diagnosis (biopsy) is carried out, and in the latter case, cells may be prepared in such a manner that, for example, cytological diagnosis is carried out.",
                                "Subsequently, the expression amount of RFP in the prepared cancer cells is examined. The expression amount of RFP is usually calculated based on the comparison with control (comparison control). As the control, it is possible to use various cancer cells whose expression amount of RFP has been preliminary determined, and normal cells collected together with the cancer cells to be tested when the cancer cells to be tested are collected from a living body. It is not necessary to strictly quantitate the expression amount of RFP, but the expression amount of RFP may be detected in such a degree that the resistance of the cancer cells to be tested to an anticancer drug can be evaluated through comparison with control. Note here that as usually, the case in which the expression of RFP is observed in the cancer cells to be tested is also defined as RFP positive (or positive to RFP), and the case in which the expression of RFP in the cancer cells to be tested is not observed is also defined as RFP negative (or negative to RFP). When the expression amount of RFP of the cancer cells to be tested is detected by immunohistochemistry (detail is described in later), for example, when staining of not less than 10% of the cancer cells to be tested is recognized that is to say, the rate of the stained cells is not less than 10%), the cells are determined to be RFP positive (or positive to RFP). A boundary value for distinguishing positive from negative (which is represented by the rate of the stained cells) may be appropriately set according to the detection method or detection conditions. For example, a boundary value can be set to 5% to 30%.",
                                "The expression amount of RFP is detected by the protein level or the mRNA level. When high accuracy is required, the former is better. When the expression amount of RFP is detected by the protein level, that is to say, when the RFP protein amount is examined as the expression amount of RFP, a western blotting method or immunohistochemistry (immunostaining) may be used although the method is not limited thereto. By the immunohistochemistry, the form or distribution state of the cancer cells to be tested can be examined at the same time, additional information can be obtained at the same time.",
                                "In the immunohistochemistry, an antibody specifically recognizing RFP (anti-RFP antibody) is used, and the amount of RFP protein is examined using a binding property (a binding amount) of the antibody as an indicator. The immunohistochemistry using an anti-RFP antibody can be carried out by, for example, an ABC (Avidin-Biotin Complex) method, a PAP (Peroxydase-anti-Peroxydase Complex) method, a LAB (Linked Avidin-Biotin) method, a LSAB (Linked Streptavidin-Biotin) method, and the like. Standard protocol of each method is well known (see, for example, \u201cEnzyme-labeled Antibody Method\u201d 3rd revised edition, K. Watanabe and K. Nakane (ed), Gakusai Kikaku).",
                                "Types and origins of the anti-RFP antibodies to be used in the immunohistochemistry are not particularly limited. Preferably, a monoclonal antibody is used, but an oligoclonal antibody (a mixture of several types to several tens types of antibodies) or a polyclonal antibody can be used as long as RFP can be detected with sufficient specificity. Antibody fragments such as Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, scFv, and dsFv antibodies can be used. The anti-RFP antibody can be prepared by immunologic procedure, a phage display technique, a ribosome display method, and the like. Note here that the document \u201cShimono, Y. et al. RET finger protein is a transcriptional repressor and interacts with enhancer of polycomb that has dual transcriptional functions. J Biol Chem. 275(50): 39411-9 (2000)\u201d describes a preparation method of an anti-RFP antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody) and use thereof, and it can be referred to.",

                                "We first tested whether HDACi affect cellular sensitivity to the oxidative stress, using the HeLa human cervical cancer cell line. Treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a conventional HDACi, sensitized the HeLa cells to H2O2, a potent oxidative stress inducer (FIG. 1a). To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this sensitization of cancer cells to oxidative stress, we focused on roles of HDAC1, which is a well studied member of HDACs, Knockdown of HDAC1 greatly increased cytotoxicity of H2O2 as well as cisplatin in HeLa cells (FIG. 1b-d). Although it is proposed that p53 associates with HDAC1 to regulate cellular sensitivity to the oxidative stress (References 16-19), other mechanisms may exist in HeLa cells in which p53 is inactivated by the papillomavirus protein E6.",
                                "Since we previously found that RET finger protein (RFP), that is highly expressed in most of cancer cell lines, is associated and colocalized with HDAC1 (Reference 20), we tried to elucidated whether RFP is involved in the biological function of HDAC1 regarding the sensitivity to the oxidative stress. First we determined the binding domain of RFP and HDAC1. The amino-terminal region of HDAC1 bound to both coiled-coil and Rfp domain of RFP (FIG. 2). In addition, knockdown of either REP or HDAC1 enhanced sensitivity of cancer cells to H2O2 and cisplatin (FIG. 1b-g), suggesting the possibility that HDAC1 is functionally associated with RFP.",
                                "Because both HDAC1 and RFP have transcriptional repressor activity hypothesized that HDAC1 and RFP may cooperatively repress the common target genes which are responsible for the sensitization of cells to the cytotoxic agents. To identify such target genes, we generated stable HeLa cells expressing control or RFP short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and compared the gene expression profiles by DNA microarray. Among genes up-regulated in RFP-knockdown cells, we focused on the TBP-2 gene because it has also been reported to be significantly up-regulated by a HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (Reference 15). It is well known that TBP-2 inhibits thioredoxin (References 22 and 23), a scavenger of ROS, and sensitizes cells to oxidative stress and cisplatin (References 4 and 24). From the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis, we confirmed that TBP-2 expression is transcriptionally regulated by HDAC1 and RFP (FIG. 3a, b). To test whether TBP-2 indeed sensitizes the cells to H2O2 and cisplatin, TBP-2 was overexpressed in HeLa cells. Overexpression of TBP-2 markedly increased the sensitivity to these agents (FIG. 3d, e), suggesting that the induced expression of TBP-2 in HeLa cells is responsible for the increased sensitivity to H2O2 and cisplatin in HDAC 1 or RFP knockdown cells, We further examined whether the induced TBP-2 expression by siHDAC1 or siRFP account for the increased sensitivity, Knockdown of TBP-2 significantly recovered the cellular resistance to H2O2 and cisplatin, which was decreased by knockdown of HDAC1 or RFP (FIG. 3f-h). These results showed that HDAC1 and RFP increase cellular resistance to these agents in part by repressing the TBP-2 expression.",
                                "Furthermore, it was confirmed that the same results were observed when the cell lines of colon carcinoma and breast cancers were used (FIG. 4).",
                                "We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to examine whether HDAC 1 and RFP were recruited to the promoter region of the TBP-2 gene and directly regulate its expression. Both HDAC1 and RFP were recruited to the proximal, but not distal, region of the TBP-2 promoter. Luciferase reporter assay showed that HDAC1 and RFP can coordinately repress the TBP-2 promoter activity, and transcriptional repression activity of RFP was inhibited by HDACi (data now shown). Since the expression of TBP-2 is increased by the knockdown of RFP, it is thought that acetylation of histone in a TBP-2 promoter region is accelerated. ChIP using RFP knockdown cells showed an increase of the acetylation levels of the histone H3 and 114 at the promoter (FIG. 5b). Furthermore, recruitment of HDAC1 in a TBP-2 promoter region is weakened by the suppression of expression of RFP, the acetylation of histone by RFP knockdown is thought to be caused because HDAC1 is not recruited. These results strongly suggest that RFP recruits HDAC1 to the TBP-2 promoter region and represses its transcription thorough the HDAC activity.",
                                "Because neither HDAC1 nor RFP has been reported to directly bind to DNA, HDAC1-RFP complex might be recruited to the promoter by DNA binding proteins. Previous studies indicated that the proximal region of TBP-2 promoter includes NF-Y binding sequence and that the induction of TBP-2 expression by HDACi was regulated by NF-Y (Reference 15). Hence, we speculated that NF-Y may be a candidate that recruits the HDAC1-RFP complex to the TBP-2 promoter. NF-Y is a trimeric transcription factor consisted of NF-YA, B and C. Co-immunoprecipitation study revealed that RFP can specifically interact with NF-YC (FIG. 5c, d). This suggests that HDAC1, RFP, and NF-Y may form protein complex. To investigate this protein complex, NF-YC-V5, Flag-HDAC1 and Flag-RFP constructs were transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells and was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody. HDAC1 and RFP were co-immunoprecipitated with NF-YC (FIG. 5e).",
                                "ChIP assay revealed that NF-Y is associated with the proximal region of TBP-2 promoter (FIG. 5f) as observed for HDAC1 and RFP, and knockdown of NF-YC markedly attenuated recruitment of both HDAC1 and RFP to the TBP-2 promoter (FIG. 5g, h). These results imply that HDAC 1, RFP and NF-Y form protein complex on the TBP-2 promoter. In addition, from the results of gel filtration chromatography we found HDAC1, RFP and NF-YC were detected in the same fractions (around 400 kDa fractions). This fact supports that these proteins form a complex.",
                                "The results shown in FIG. 5 suggested that RFP mediates the interaction between HDAC1 and NF-YC. Consistent with this view, the association between HDAC1 and NF-YC was enhanced in exogenously RFP-expressed cells, whereas it was conversely attenuated in RFP knockdown cells (FIG. 6b, c). These findings indicate that RFP mediate the formation of the protein complex. Since RFP has been reported to form oligomer (References 25 and 26), we determined the domain required for its oligomerization. As shown in FIG. 7b, Ring-B-box (RB) and Coiled-coil (CC) domain, but not Rfp domain (RD), of RFP is required for RFP-RFP oligomerization.",
                                "Since experiments so far showed that an Rfp domain was necessary for RFP to bind to HDAC1 and NF-YC, it was thought that RFP was polymerized in RB and CC at the N-terminal side, and it bound to HDAC1 and NF-YC respectively in an Rfp domain at C-terminal side so as to form a HDAC1-RFP-NF-Y protein complex (FIG. 5i).",
                                "Furthermore, the effect of the expression of RFP in, in vivo anticancer drug treatment models was studied. A cell line in which control (shNC1) and shRNA of RFP (shRFP23 and shRFP26) had been expressed were subcutaneously transplanted into a nude mouse. When tumors grew to larger than volume of 50 mm3, ciplatin was injected intraperitoneally every four day. Treatment with cisplatin more markedly suppressed tumor growth of RFP knockdown cells than control cells (FIG. 8a-c).",
                                "Lastly, we analysed the effect of RFP expression on the prognosis of cancer patient. We obtained specimens with 115 colon carcinoma patients. RFP-positive colon cancer was defined when more than 10% of tumor cells were clearly stained with anti-RFP antibody. As a result, 68 out of 115 colon carcinoma samples were RFP-positive (FIG. 8d). Expression of RFP and TBP-2 were exclusive and TBP-2 expression was clearly down regulated in RFP expressing cells in colon cancer specimen (FIG. 8e). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of these cases revealed a significant correlation between RFP expression and shorter overall survival (FIG. 8f). These results suggest that the levels of RFP expression in colon cancer affect efficacy of anticancer drugs as well as clinical outcome of the patients.",
                                "The synergistic anti-tumor effects of HDACi and chemotherapeutic agents have received considerable attention in research for cancer treatment, however, the mechanistic basis of the synergy has not been fully clarified. Several studies have suggested the putative mechanism that HDAC1 regulates cellular sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stresses through the association with p53 (References 16-19). We presented here direct evidence that HDAC1 form a complex with RFP and NF-YC and regulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to oxidative stress through the repression of TBP-2 expression. Based on previous reports, up-regulated TBP-2 expression may reduce the ROS scavenging ability of thioredoxin and sensitize cancer cells to oxidative stress induced by anti-cancer drugs. With the view of these data, HDAC1 confers the cancer cells resistance to anti-cancer agents by regulating the state of anti-oxidant system.",
                                "Moreover, we demonstrated that knockdown of RFP significantly sensitized cancer cells to anti-cancer drug. Thus, RFP could become a novel target for anticancer therapy in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. Although HDACi have potent anticancer activities at concentrations that are minimally toxic to the host, dose-limiting toxicities were also observed (Reference 28). Given the tissue-restricted expression of RFP in normal cells (Reference 29) and no apparent phenotypic defects in RFP knockout mice, the development of RFP-targeted cancer therapy may be beneficial with less toxicity.",
                                "Our finding could provide a new insight into the molecular mechanism that underlies the synergy between HDACi and anti-cancer drugs.",
                                "For further investigation, the relation between the expression of RFP in endometrial cancer and prognosis was examined. As a result, in the investigation of all patients groups (FIG. 9(a)), it was shown that prognosis was significantly poor in a patients group in which the expression of RFP was observed. Furthermore, when the same investigation was carried out by dividing patients groups into stage I and stages II to IV, the expression of RFP correlates to poor prognosis regardless of stages (FIG. 9(b)(c)). Subsequently, the relation between the expression of RFP and the prognosis was compared between patients groups in which different operations were employed respectively. Herein, the difference between radical hysterectomy and total hysterectomy was investigated. As a result, in the RFP negative group, no significant difference in prognosis based on the difference in operative method is not observed (FIG. 10(b)), but in the RFP positive group, the prognosis is significantly improved in the radical hysterectomy group as compared with the total hysterectomy group (FIG. 10(c)). On the other hand, the difference based on the presence or absence of lymphadenectomy was investigated. In the RFP negative group, no significant difference between both groups (a patients group (+) that underwent lymphadenectomy and a patients group (\u2212) that did not undergo lymphadenectomy) (FIG. 11(b)). However, in the RFP positive group, it was shown that prognosis was improved in a group that underwent lymphadenectomy as compared with a patient group that did not undergo lymphadenectomy (FIG. 11(c)). With the consideration of the results of both FIGS. 10 and 11 together, for patients in which expression of RFP is observed, it can be thought that employing more aggressive operation leads to improvement of prognosis. It can be said that information for selecting a operative method can be obtained by confirming the state of expression of RFP (for example, immunostaining is carried out) in biopsy for diagnosis of endometrial cancer."
