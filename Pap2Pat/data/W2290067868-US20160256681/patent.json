    "abstract": "Studies of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying human myopathies and muscular dystrophies often require animal models, but models of some human diseases are not yet available. The present invention provides methods to promote the engraftment and development of myogenic cells from individuals with such diseases into mature muscle tissue in mice to treat muscle diseases, muscle injury and reduced muscle function. Immortalized human myogenic precursor cells (hMPCs) form mature human myofibers following implantation into the hindlimbs of immunodeficient mice. The engraftment of the cells and their development into mature muscle myofibers is promoted by intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (iNMES) of the peroneal nerve of the engrafted limb. The human myofibers that form are innervated, their contractile apparatus is fully differentiated, and they are comprised of human myonuclei, with minimal contamination by murine myonuclei.",

                        "Muscular dystrophies afflict approximately 1 in 5000 individuals worldwide. The development of animal models to study these diseases is essential in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis and to test potential therapies for people afflicted with these diseases. Animal models for some muscular dystrophies, such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (\u201cFSHD\u201d) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (\u201cOPMD\u201d), are still unavailable. Furthermore, some murine models of some muscular dystrophies, whether naturally occurring or genetically engineered, are limited because they do not replicate all the features of the human disease.",
                        "An animal model that carries human muscles from individuals with these diseases would serve as a more accurate model, reproducing most, if not all, of the morphological, physiological and genomic features of the muscular dystrophies in man. The present invention describes methods to develop such a model, while solving the problem of the presence of murine myonuclei in the graft. Here, intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (iNMES) is applied to immunodeficient mice engrafted with an immortalized clonal cell line of human myogenic precursor cells (\u201chMPCs\u201d) that express luciferase (\u201cLHCN\u201d cells).",
                        "Previous studies of grafts of hMPCs create hybrid fibers, containing myonuclei of both human and murine origin form, and the fibers express proteins found both in man and in mice. In the present invention, muscle of the host mouse was eliminated by injection of a myotoxin and the myogenic potential of any remaining tissue was suppressed by X-irradiation. Human myogenic precursor cells were then injected. The survival and differentiation of the human muscle tissue were promoted with electrical stimulation. Many of the myofibers in that graft were similar to nearby murine myofibers in size, and they were both innervated by motor neurons and fully differentiated. More importantly, they were comprised almost exclusively of human myonuclei, with minimal contamination by murine myonuclei."

                        "In certain embodiments, methods are provided for treating a subject having a muscle disorder. First, a subject having the muscle disorder is identified. Human myogenic precursor cells in an amount capable of forming mature muscle tissue are injected into a portion of a limb of the subject. A nerve of the limb is then subjected to a regime of therapeutic stimulation (e.g., NMES) configured to promote and enhance engraftment of the human myogenic precursor cells. A graft is created and promotes formation of mature muscle tissue that improves the function of muscle. In some embodiments, the subject is a non-human mammal, e.g., a mouse. If the subject is non-human, it must be immunodeficient, and thus incapable of mounting an immune response to injected human cells and the subsequent graft.",
                        "In some aspects, the invention further provides a method for producing a non-human animal that models a human muscular disease. A non-human animal such as an immunocompromised mouse suitable for xenografting is obtained. The limb (e.g., a hindlimb) of the non-human animal is irradiated by exposure to with X-rays or other form of irradiation known in the art. Muscle (i.e., the Tibialis anterior muscle \u201cTA\u201d) of that limb was then injected along its length with a toxin such as cardiotoxin, a phospholipase that causes the muscle to degenerate. hMPCs capable of forming muscle tissue were injected into the compartment formerly occupied by the degenerated muscle tissue and then the peroneal nerve serving that compartment was subjected to electrical stimulation to enhance engraftment of the myoblast cells so that they develop into mature muscle tissue. The engraftment of the myogenic precursor cells in the limb treated with a regime of electrical stimulation, such as NMES, was improved compared to engraftment of a population of untreated myoblast cells. The myogenic precursor cells can be derived from healthy humans or from individuals with certain muscle diseases, notably Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSH or FSHD). Non-human animal models generated by this method in animals other than mice are also contemplated.",

Briefly, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a 2:1 mixture of 80 mg/kg ketamine (Butler Schein Animal Health, Dublin, Ohio) and 7 mg/kg xylazine (Akom, Decatur, Ill.) and placed within a lead box. A person of ordinary skill in the art may use other anesthetics if determined to be appropriated and included but are not limited to isofluorane and 2-2-2-Tribromoethanol. The left hindlimb was exposed through a hole in the box for X-ray irradiation at a single dose of 25 Gy at 2.5 Gy/min. The hindlimb was secured with adhesive tape. The ionizing irradiation was delivered with a Pantak-Seifert 250 KpV X-Irradiator (bipolar series model HF 320, East Haven, Conn.). The radiation beam was focused onto the lower hindlimb while the rest of the body was protected by the lead shielding. Ion chamber dosimetry (PTW model 1006, Freiburg, Germany) was performed outside the collimator to ensure delivery of the exact dosage to the hindlimb, as well as inside the collimator (lead shielding), to monitor backscatter of radiation.",

Anesthetized mice were placed in a light-tight chamber and the light emitted from the LHCN-luciferase-expressing myoblasts through the TA grafted tissue was detected with a cooled charge coupled device camera. Imaging was performed 15 minutes after injection, when the luciferase activity reached its peak. A sequence of 12 scans with 5 min intervals were acquired (a total of 120 min), to determine the peak kinetic time. At regular intervals thereafter, usually on a weekly or biweekly basis, for 4 to 7 weeks, imaging was performed to assess the rate of loss of transplanted cells over time.

The remainder of the TA muscle is freed from surrounding tissue and tied via the thread to the foot plate, which is connected to a force transducer. The Extensor digitorum longus muscle is cut, and the isolated TA is then adjusted on the footplate to a resting tension of \u02dc0.6 N/mm. Electrical stimulation is initiated from frequencies of 1-100 Hz and the tension is measured. Mineral oil is applied to the muscle surface, as needed, to prevent dehydration.

The results show that injection of 5\u00d7105 LHCN cells, 406, yielded only one mouse in which a significant number of myofibers of human origin were detected, with the remaining 13 mice showing no such myofibers. Injection of 2\u00d7106 LHCN cells yielded many more fibers of human origin, however.

The largest number of human myofibers in LHCN-generated grafts is 226, or approximately 10% of the number of myofibers in a normal mouse TA muscle (Sharp et al., 2011). These results confirm that injection of 2\u00d7106 LHCN cells, but not 5\u00d7105 LHCN cells, reliably yields grafts containing myofibers of human origin, and that NMES further enhances the formation of such grafts and increases the number of human myofibers in them.",

These results confirm that injection of 2\u00d7106 LHCN cells, but not 5\u00d7105 LHCN cells, reliably yields grafts containing large myofibers of human origin, and that NMES increases the number of large human myofibers in the grafts.",

Due to variability in the overall morphology of the LHCN-transplanted TA muscles, quantification of the extent of collagenous tissue in the engrafted regions was not possible. Therefore, only qualitative assessment of fibrosis was made across experimental groups 2 and 3. FIG. 7A-7B illustrate, 700, immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to collagen I and III and revealed less collagenous materials surrounding the engrafted human myofibers in Group 3 compared with Group 2 (FIG. 7A-7B). The amount of collagen present and labeled by the antibodies seems to increase as the distances between neighboring fibers increase, consistent with the presence of fibrotic tissue in those gaps. Collagen staining revealed more extensive fibrosis in the human muscle grafts that were not (FIG. 7A) subjected to NMES, 702, than in those that were (FIG. 7B) subjected to NMES, 704. The regions between myofibers in grafts subjected to iNMES contained far less labeling collagen then untreated grafts, consistent with the closer packing of myofibers promoted by NMES. Without being bound by theory, the formation of larger, more tightly packed fibers in Group 3 is associated with a reduction in fibrosis.",

This is a late stage in myogenesis, indicating considerable maturity of the tissue formed by the engrafted cells (Capetanaki et al., 2007). Similar reticular networks of desmin were observed in cross-sections of the largest myofibers in Group 2 (not shown). These results indicate that the contractile apparatus in the large fibers of human origin in the grafts is differentiated, as it is in mature mammalian muscle.",

FIG. 9A-9B are photographs, 900, illustrating immunofluorescence images of central nuclei in fibers of human origin. Samples were labeled with antibodies to human lamin A/C, 902, as well as with antibodies to human \u03b2-spectrin, 904. In developing or regenerating muscle tissue, nuclei were frequently found in the middle of the cell, whereas in mature, fully differentiated muscle tissue, nearly all of the myonuclei were located peripherally, immediately adjacent to the sarcolemma. Examination of the grafts formed by LHCN cells showed that 82% (121 of 149) and 79% (146 of 185) of the myonuclei in the grafts were located peripherally in Groups 2 and 3, respectively, and that the remaining \u02dc20% of the myonuclei in both groups were centrally located. Thus, by this criterion \u02dc20% of the fibers are in the process of developing or regenerating, while \u02dc80% were fully differentiated.",
                                "These results suggested that the engrafted LHCN cells were capable of terminally differentiating into mature muscle during the 4-week post transplantation period, and that, although this ability of the grafts to form myofibers that are >20 \u03bcm in diameter is promoted by NMES, NMES is not strictly required for the differentiation of myofibers in the graft.",
                                "The presence of differentiated myofibers of the size found in the xenografts suggested that the fibers formed by LHCN cells were innervated. In the absence of innervation, these fibers would atrophy significantly, and would consequently be greatly reduced in size. To test for innervation, the grafts of Group 3 were labeled with a fluorescent derivative of \u03b1-bungarotoxin, to detect the large clusters of acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. Structures typical of postsynaptic membrane that labeled by \u03b1-bungarotoxin on muscle fibers of human origin were found, indicating that innervation had occurred within 4 weeks after transplantation of LHCN cells. FIG. 10A-10B are photographs, 1000, that illustrate immunofluorescence staining of labeling of the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, 1002, in grafts treated with iNMES or with antibodies to SV2 antigen to label presynaptic structures, 1004. Immunolabeled sections were also examined with antibodies to SV2, a protein found in presynaptic vesicles at motor nerve terminals. SV2 was found in structures typical of nerve terminals lying along muscle fibers of human origin, consistent with the innervation of these fibers in the xenografts.",
                                "It was considered a possibility that, despite the fact the hindlimbs of mice were irradiated to prevent muscle regeneration following CTX intoxication, the myofibers formed by LHCN cells were hybrids formed by the fusion of the LHCN cells not only with each other but also with mouse myoblasts. In the absence of a mouse-specific lamin A/C antibody, mouse myonuclei were identified as those DAPI-stained myonuclei within myofibers that stained positively for human \u03b2-spectrin. To avoid any ambiguity in distinguishing peripheral myonuclei from nuclei of nearby cells, such as those in fibroblasts, capillaries and lymphocytes, analysis was limited to central nuclei, such as those shown in FIG. 9. The numbers of centrally located nuclei of mouse origin was extremely low in the human myofibers formed by LHCN cells in both in Group 2 (1/149, 1.3%), and Group 3 (5/185, 2.7%). These results suggest that there was minimal murine contamination of the human myofibers formed by LHCN cell grafts.",
                                "Consistent with these results, qualitative assessment of the human muscle grafts across the three experimental groups revealed that the vast majority of the mouse myofibers were ablated following X-irradiation and CTX treatment. Those remaining were typically at the edge of the xenograft containing human muscle tissue, suggesting that the latter was free of mouse muscle tissue. Therefore, the combination of X-irradiation and CTX treatments of the mouse TA muscle not only eliminates all or nearly all of the tissue of murine origin, but also inhibits the formation of hybrid human-mouse myofibers formed by transplantation of the LHCN myoblasts.",

                                "**Methods for Treatment of Muscle Disorders by Enhancing Myoblast Cell Engraftment to Generate Mature Muscle Fibers**",
                                "In certain embodiments, a subject having a muscle disorder is identified. The subject may be a mammal such as a mouse or human. If the mammal is non-human such as a mouse, the non-human mammal must be immunocompromised so that it does not reject injection of hMPCs. hMSCs are used to regenerate, repair, or newly generate muscle that has been damaged through disease or degeneration. In certain embodiments, hMPCs differentiate into muscle cells and integrate with the healthy tissue of the recipient to replace the function of the dead or damaged cells, thereby repairing and/or regenerating the muscle tissue as a whole. Reduced muscle function can be caused by a number of muscle diseases including, but not limited to those listed in Table 1.",
                                "hMPCs are injected into the portion of the limb. In certain embodiments, hMPCs of different origins, distinct from LHCN cells, may be injected. hMPCs may be injected at different times after irradiation and intoxication, at different doses and frequencies, and over a different time course, as determined by one of skill in the art. In some aspects, injection can be provided by several routes of administration, including but not limited to, intramuscle injection, if the hMPCs are in a liquid suspension preparation or where they are in a biocompatible medium which is injectable in liquid form. A conventional intramuscle syrine can serve as a delivery device and can buse used so long as the needle lumen or bore is of sufficient diameter so as to not damage the hMPCs. The injectable hMPCs can also be administered intravenously either by continuous drip or as a bolus. The nerve of the limb (e.g, pereoneal nerve) is subjected to therapeutic electrical stimulation such as NMES or other means such as exercise (e.g., running wheel in a cage or on a treadmill) configured to enhance engraftment of the myogenic precursor cells.",
                                "As a representative example of a dose range in a non-human mammal such as a mouse is a volume of at least about 2\u00d7106 hMPCs in 50 \u03bcl into the former TA region. For humans, the dosage would be configured by one of ordinary skill in the art depending on necessity due to the health of the subject, extent of muscle disease, muscle injury, and degree of loss of function.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the subjects may be rendered incapable of rejecting the engrafted hMPCs by x-irradiation or by genetic means or by means other than genetic means. Such means may include, but are not limited to, other forms of radiation or treatment with a drug that suppresses the immune system. Different doses and time courses for x-irradiation and these other means used to suppress the myogenic potential of the muscle in the subject and are known in the art. Engrafted limbs may be treated in certain embodiments with drugs, hormones, or other biologically active compounds or materials to promote engraftment. Such reagents ma include, but not be limited to, losartan, IFG1, antibodies to TGF-\u03b2 proteins, and the region of the ActRIIB receptor that binds proteins of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily.",
                                "In some aspects, the present invention generally relates to methods of generating mature human muscle fibers in vivo i.e., in mice, free from murine myonuclei, and similar in size to mouse muscle fibers. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of generating mature human muscle fibers in a non-human animal such as a mouse comprising: a) removing the non-human or mouse muscle e.g., TA muscle and preventing it from regenerating, b) injecting human myogenic cells into a portion of a limb of the non-human animal or into the volume previously occupied by the muscle, and c) subjecting the peroneal nerve of the injected limb to electrical stimulation in vivo. Electrical stimulation has long been known to promote muscle differentiation in vitro (e.g., DeDeyne, 2000; Pedroty et al., 2005; Stern-Straeter et al., 2005, Serena et al., 2008) and in vivo (DiStefano et al., 2013; Ambrosio et al., 2012) and NMES has been used therapeutically in man to promote the recovery of skeletal muscle from injury (Dirks et al., 2014; Bittar and Cliquet, 2010; Kim et al., 2010; Stackhouse et al., 2007). The present invention uses NMES to promote the successful generation of mature human muscle fibers in mice in vivo.",
                                "NMES involves the use of a device which transmits an electrical impulse to the skin over selected muscle groups by way of electrodes. The NMES causes muscles to contract as a form of exercise or physical therapy. NMES of healthy muscle is intended to strengthen or maintain muscle mass during or following periods of enforced inactivity, maintain or gain range of motion, facilitate voluntary muscle control, and temporaily reduce spasticity. Standard treatment in human can be 3 to 4 sessions a week for one month when used as adjunctive therapy or muscle retraining. As a means for enhancing engraftment in a nonhuman animal, such as a mouse, in certain embodiments, NEMS can be administered intermittently from one day to about 28 days or longer from the time of injection of myogenic cells. More specifically, in about 7 days from injection of myogenic cells. This can occur for a period of 4 to 5 weeks. In certain embodiments, NMES can be administered intermittently at 150 Hz for 500 msec, repeated 10 times. This can than be repeated 4 times with 2 minute rests, for a total of 40 repetitions, three times per week, for 4-5 weeks. One of ordinary skill in the art could change frequency, repetition, and timing to suit experimentation.",
                                "The TA muscle may be eliminated by any method known in the art, including, but not limited to, irradiating the hindlimb with X-rays and then injecting it with a toxin such as cardiotoxin, BaCl2 or notexin. As a representative example, cardiotoxin CTX may be injected in a dose of 60 \u03bcl of a 0.3 mg/ml solution. For example, it is known in the art that the neurotoxin from tiger snake venom (notexin, Notechis scutatus) has a LD50 6.4 mg/kg sc mice, minimum dose for myoglobinuria 1.4 mg/kg sc mice. Other toxins such as P. australis venom are lethal and can cause myoglobinuria in mice, having a LD50 for 0.25 mg/kg ip mice. See Leonardi et al 1979. One of ordinary skill in the art would know how to determine the proper dosage for the toxin of choice (i.e., BaCl2 or notexin) to induce paralysis. Therapeutic electrical stimulation can be applied for the first time from between one day and about 14 days from the time the myogenic cells are injected. In certain embodiments electrical stimulation is begun approximately one week after the myogenic cells are injected. The duration and amount of electrical stimulation may range beyond what is specifically used in the working examples described herein.",
                                "**Treatment of the Muscle Disease FSHD**",
                                "Over the last decade several reports examined the possibility that human myoblast therapy is useful for the treatment of genetic muscle diseases. Improved strains of immunodeficient mice have been developed that allow efficient engraftment, differentiation and maturation of human myogenic cells (Huard et al., 1994; Skuk et al., 1999; Pye et al., 2004; Silva-Barbosa et al., 2005; Silva-Barbosa et al., 2008). Earlier studies of grafts formed by injecting human myogenic precursor cells into mice yielded limited numbers of muscle fibers with human myonuclei (Mouly et al., 2005; Mamchaoui et al., 2011; Reed et al., 2007; Riederer et al., 2012).",
                                "Two approaches have been tested to develop grafts of human muscle tissues in mice. In one approach, xenografts are created by introducing small pieces of mature human muscle myofibers, obtained at biopsy, and suturing them to muscles in immunodeficient mice (Zhang et al, 2014). Over time, some of these grafts survive and reform mature muscle tissue that is largely human in origin. But these grafts are fibrotic and can also contain significant numbers of murine myonuclei. Although the mice carrying these human grafts provide potentially excellent models, it would be difficult to generate in the numbers needed for therapeutic testing.",
                                "As an alternative approach, the ability of human myogenic cells to develop into mature human muscle tissue in immunodeficient or dystrophic mice has been investigated. (Riederer et al., 2012; Silva-Barbosa et al., 2008; Silva-Barbosa et al., 2005). In these studies, the endogenous murine muscle is typically eliminated by freezing or injection of a toxin, and, in some cases, regeneration is reduced by prior X-irradiation. Human myoblasts are often tagged with an enzyme such as luciferase (Laumonier et al., 2013; Libani et al., 2011), or a fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Benabdallah et al., 2013; Quenneville et al., 2007), to enable them to be tracked by luminometric or fluorescence methods after they are injected into adult mouse skeletal muscle. After injection, mice have been exposed to different pharmacological agents, such as Losartan (Fakhfakh et al., 2012b), to alter angiotensin II signaling, and a soluble form of the receptor for myostatin, ActRIIB-Fc (Fakhfakh et al., 212a), to promote myogenesis and reduce fibrosis.",
                                "These treatments have improved the survival of the engrafted human myogenic cells in mice and their differentiation into myofibers. However, the muscles they form are very small and therefore difficult to study by physiological morphological and genomic methods. The engrafted muscle grafts may also contain a large number of murine myonuclei, indicating that they are largely hybrid in nature (Fakhfakh et al., 2012a; Ehrhardt et al., 2007).",
                                "In addition, the methods that have been used to suppress murine myogenesis following injury to murine muscle proved ineffective in preventing murine muscle from reforming. As the engrafted cells must compete with myogenic precursor cells derived from murine satellite cells, they can at best form myofibers of mixed human-mouse origin. This is less than optimal for studying the human dystrophic phenotype, considering the likelihood of genetic complementation compensating for the cause of the myopathy in hybrid fibers.",
                                "Studies of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophies often require animal models, but models of some human muscle diseases are not yet available. Of specific interest in certain embodiments is FSHD. FSHD is one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy in adults, caused by an epigenetic derepression of the macrosatellite repeat D4Z4 in the 4q35 region, either by contraction of the repeat array (FSHD1; Wijmenga et al., 1992; vanDeutekom et al., 1993) or by mutations in modifier genes, such as SMCHD1 (FSHD2) (Lemmers et al., 2012). These genetic and epigenetic changes combined with FSHD-permissive chromosomal alleles (Lemmers et al., 2010) can lead to an ectopic expression of the DUX4 retrogene, a potent germline transcription factor, residing in each D4Z4 repeat.",
                                "Although accumulating evidence supports the possible pathogenic role of DUX4 in FSHD development, DUX4 may not be the sole candidate gene. A recent model proposes that deregulation of a global transcriptional cascade involving numerous DUX4 target genes, initially triggered by DUX4 activation randomly in rare FSHD myonuclei, could lead to muscle atrophy, inflammation, oxidative stress and defects in differentiation process, all key features of FSHD (Tassin et al., 2012). Pathogenesis in FSHD may also be linked to other gene products, including long noncoding RNAs (Cabianca et al., Cell. 2012; PMID: 22541069) and miRNAs (Cheli et al., PLoS One. 2011; PMID: 21695143). Despite extensive study, the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD are still not fully understood.",
                                "As a result, a valid mouse model of the disease was in need of development. Without one, studies of the disease in vivo are significantly limited. Several laboratories have generated mice by transgenic or viral expression of DUX4 (Krom et al., 2012; Wallace et al., 2011), or potential downstream mediators of their activity, such as PITX1 (Dixit et al., 2007) and CRYM (Reed et al., 2007; our unpublished data). None have so far reproduced the phenotype seen in biopsies of FSHD patients. Indeed, the likelihood that FSHD is caused by both genetic and epigenetic changes (Jones et al., 2012; Lemmers et al., 2012; Lemmers et al., 2010; Rahimov et al., 2012), regulated by modifier genes that remain to be identified (Jones et al., 2012), casts doubt on the possibility that a simple transgenic model can be created by manipulating individual genes.",
                                "In certain aspects of the invention, a murine model for FSHD should reproduce all the features of FSHD muscle, retaining the morphological, physiological and genomic differences found in fresh biopsies. As the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis in FSHD are still unclear, it is necessary to construct muscle tissue for study in vivo from patient-derived human myogenic cells, which presumably retain these disease-causing changes. Applicant optimized transplantation conditions for successful engraftment of a cell line derived from a FSHD patient using immortalized human myogenic precursor cells and injecting these myoblast cells into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle compartment in the anterior hindlimb of immunodeficient NOD-Rag1null IL2rynull mice (NOD-Rag).",
                                "In one embodiment, hMPCs from a patient with Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy were introduced into mice, following the methods described herein, including NMES, muscle fibers of human origin developed and expressed several genes typical of FSHD tissue. In particular, the fibers generated following engraftment of these cells labeled with antibodies to human \u03b2-spectrin and to human lamin A/C (not shown). Furthermore, when harvested and assayed by quantitative RT-PCR methods and compared to the grafts formed by LHCN cells, they contained several fold higher levels of mRNA encoding DUX4 (not shown), a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of FSHD. Consistent with this, quantitative RT-PCR methods also showed significant increases in mRNAs encoding at least two gene products that are transcribed when DUX4 is elevated (not shown). These results indicate that our methods are not limited to LHCN cells, that they are generally applicable to hMPCs, including hMPCs derived from subjects with neuromuscular disease, and that the grafts that they produce retain many of the characteristics of the tissue from which the hMPCs originated.",
                                "The usefulness of certain embodiments was also tested by creating xenografts of hMPCs from diseased tissue in mimicking the disease phenotype in mice. Immortalized hMPCs from a patient with FSHD were used for this purpose. These cells, like LHCN cells, had been transduced to express firefly luciferase. Using the methods described, it was found that FSHD cells engrafted in mice at least as well as in controls. PCR for DUX4 was performed on mRNA from 2 grafts (G31M3, P19M2), and 2 mouse TA muscles. 17ABic was a positive control for Dux4. hRPL13A was a human-specific marker. The grafts formed from FSHD hMPCs express Dux4 but the controls do not (data not shown). qPCR for two Dux4 downstream genes was performed on mRNA from 1 graft formed by LHCN cells and 2 by FSHD cells The results show a significant increase (p<0.05) in expression of TRIM43 and ZSCAN4 in grafts formed by the FSHD hMPCs (data not shown). Therefore, xenografts formed by FSHD hMPCs preserve the distinct genetic program observed in the hMPCs in culture and in the biopsies from which those cells were originally derived. With further optimization, certain embodiments will yield mice carrying mature FSHD muscles. The mice carrying these grafts should be suitable for testing therapies to treat FSHD. The most sensitive and reliable assays utilize qRT-PCR of FSHD-specific biomarkers, which are applicable to Applicant's mouse model. A therapeutic drug for FSHD should bring biomarker levels to close to controls. Thus, the methods described here should make it possible to screen compounds and compare therapeutic efficacies of different drugs on living FSHD muscle tissue in vivo.",
                                "In certain embodiments, optimization of these unique xenografting conditions for successful transplantation of normal immortalized human myoblasts in mice will allow future testing of similar immortalized cell lines derived from FSHD patients and their first-degree relatives (Mamchaoui et al., 2011; Stadler et al., 2011). It is expected that the mature myofibers derived from immortalized FSHD myoblasts will show the phenotype of FSHD muscle, with all the associated genetic, epigenetic, physiological and morphological properties (Geng et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Lassche et al., 2013; Lemmers et al., 2010; Rahimov et al., 2012; Reed et al., 2006), independently of any particular molecular model of pathogenesis.",
                                "Considering the feasibility of assaying this mature human muscle tissue in mice morphologically and physiologically, and the validity and use of LHCN immortalized normal cells as a universal human cellular model, other embodiments are directed to the application of such a xenotransplant model to not only FSHD, but a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders.",

                                "The invention further provides a method for producing a non-human animal that models a human muscular disease. A non-human animal such as an immunocompromised mouse suitable for xenografting is obtained. The hindlimb of the non-human animal is irradiated with X-rays. The TA muscle is extracted and a cardiotoxin or other toxin (e.g., BaCl2 or notexin) is injected along the length of the TA muscle to induce degeneration of myofibers of the TA muscle in the non-human animal thereby and creating a volume or compartment where TA muscle used to be located. HMPCs or LHCN cells obtained from a human muscular disease are tagged with an enzyme such as luciferase and injected into the non-human TA muscle compartment to form a graft. The peroneal nerve of the injected hindlimb is subjected to electrical stimulation. Contractile function of myofibers of human origin is then assessed. The graft generated by human myogenic precursor cells obtained from a human muscular disease may then be compared with cells obtained from a non-diseased muscle and ultimately screened for therapeutic drugs. Non-human animal models generated by this method are also contemplated.",
                                "In some embodiments where hMPCs are implanted into an animal subject, the animal can be used as an in vivo humanized model of muscular disease. For example, an animal model which comprises functional, innervated, vascularized human muscle tissue, can be used to screen for therapeutic agents, viruses or drugs which affect any one, or a combination of viability, functionality, contractibility, differentiation of the human muscle tissue.",
                                "Accordingly, one embodiment relates to the use of an in vivo humanized model of muscle disease as an assay, for example to assess drug toxicity (e.g. myotoxicity) on human muscle tissue in vivo (e.g. to identify agents which increase apoptosis, decrease viability, modulate (e.g. increase or decrease by a statistically significantly amount) contractibility and/or conductivity of muscle tissue).

                                "In other embodiments, the mice carrying the grafts formed by LHCN cells have potentially broad uses, e.g., determining the myotropism of viruses for gene therapy, assessing the effects of drugs, antibodies, microorganisms and toxins on mature human muscle, and developing new approaches to treating a number of human diseases of muscle. Specifically applied to muscular dystrophies such as FSHD, the methods are significant because they provide an excellent means of generating mature FSHD muscle tissue in mice, leading to a valuable tool for the study of pathology of the disease and its treatment, including the possible use of autologous myoblast-based therapies.",
                                "For purposes of the present invention, gene therapy refers to the transfer and stable insertion of new genetic information into cells for the therapeutic treatment of muscle diseases or muscle disorders. A foreign sequence or gene is transferred into hMPCs that proliferate to spread the new sequence or gene throughout the cell population. Known methods of gene transfer include microinjection, electroporation, liposomes, chromosome transfer, transfection techniques, calcium-precipitation transfection techniques, and the like. For example, muscular dystrophy may result from a loss of gene function, as a result of a mutation for example, or a gain of gene function, as a result of an extra copy of a gene, such as three copies of a wild-type gene, or a gene over expressed as a result of a mutation in a promoter, for example. Expression may be altered by activating or deactivating regulatory elements, such as a promoter. A mutation may be corrected by replacing the mutated sequence with a wild-type sequence or inserting an antisense sequence to bind to an over expressed sequence or to a regulatory sequence.",
                                "Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells and may be used to construct the recombinant cells for purposes of gene therapy, in accordance with this embodiment of the invention. The technique used should provide for the stable transfer of the heterologous gene sequence to the precursor cell, so that the heterologous gene sequence is heritable and expressible by stem cell progeny, and so that the necessary development and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. Techniques which may be used include but are not limited to chromosome transfer (e.g., cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, micro cell-mediated gene transfer), physical methods (e.g., transfection, spheroplast fusion, microinjection, electroporation, liposome carrier), viral vector transfer (e.g., recombinant DNA viruses, recombinant RNA viruses) and the like (described in Cline, M. J., 1985, Pharmac. Ther. 29:69-92, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). These methods may be extended to precursor cells transfected with plasmid constructs that encode a secreted protein, allowing the grafts that are generated to provide systemic benefit to the subject, e.g., replacement of defective or absent polypeptide hormone, and serum factors.",
                                "In other embodiments, muscle tissue with hereditary muscle disease may be identified. hMPCs obtained from this muscle tissue may be isolated. It is possible to then insert a gene into these hMPCs, using conventional molecular biology techniques known to those in the art, to replace a gene that is mutated or missing, while maintaining exactly the same genetic background. The hMPCs expressing the healthy gene may be injected into a subject in need of muscle repair. Ultimately, the muscle in which the genetic defect is so corrected can reform.",

Such reagents may include, but are not limited to, losartan, IGF1, antibodies to TFG-\u03b2 proteins, and the region of the ActRIIB receptor that binds proteins of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. In other embodiments, kits comprising the pharmaceutical composition may prevent rejection of the graft. The pharmaceutical composition and kit comprising it may be useful for repairing wounded or injured muscle, in addition to diseased muscle. For example, the methods may be applicable to treating subjects with hMPCs derived from their own healthy muscles in order to replace muscle tissue lost to wounds (e.g., injury due to military combat).",
