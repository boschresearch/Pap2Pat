    "date": "2018-01-26 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "An easily transportable micro-scale process is described for the direct production of liquid fuels from flare gas, biogas, stranded natural gas, natural gas emissions from methane hydrate dissociation, and other low-volume, gas-phase hydrocarbon resources. The process involves the design of an integrated series of tubular catalytic reactors in which each consecutive catalytic reactor in the series has been designed with larger volumes of catalyst so that a single pass efficiency of about 90% or greater is achieved while keeping the temperatures and pressures of each reactor similar and without requiring tailgas recycling to the reactors. Typically, the process employs a direct fuel production catalyst that produces undetectable, detrimental carboxylic acids in the fuel and catalyst reaction water. As a result, the directly produced, premium fuels are non-corrosive and do not degrade during long-term storage.",

                        "Gas to Liquid (GTL) technologies for converting natural gas to liquid fuels have existed for several decades. A recent resurgence of interest in converting flared gas, biogas, natural gas, and other low volume gas-phase hydrocarbon resources to liquid fuels is providing significant advancements in the rapidly growing GTL art. These advancements are motivated by the need to eliminate and simplify costly unit processes typically employed by current medium and large-scale GTL plants.",
                        "Medium-scale and large-scale plants typically convert approximately 25-250 million scf per day, and more than 250 million scf per day of gas-phase hydrocarbons to fuels and other products, respectively. These medium and large plants all employ four major processes (A. de Klerk, 2012). These processes include: 1) syngas generation; 2) syngas purification; 3) catalytic conversion of the syngas to hydrocarbon products, the primary product being wax; and 4) conversion of the wax to fuels using complex and costly refinery type processes.",
                        "In addition to wax, these plants produce side products consisting of tail-gas, liquid hydrocarbons and catalyst reaction water. The composition and concentration of these side products are dependent upon the syngas composition and purity; catalytic reactor design; catalyst formulation and catalyst operating conditions.",
                        "Syngas can be produced from many types of carbonaceous resources, including natural gas, coal, biomass, or virtually any carbon containing feedstock using thermochemical conversion processes. These thermochemical conversion processes are typically categorized as processes that 1) utilize oxygen or air or 2) processes that do not employ oxygen or air.",
                        "Syngas generation processes that utilize oxygen or air are typically referred to as direct conversion, partial oxidation (POX), or Autothermal Reforming (ATR) processes. POX is carried out with sub-stoichiometric gaseous hydrocarbon/oxygen mixtures in reformers at temperatures in the 1,500-2,700\u00b0 F. range. Praxair, Shell, ConocoPhillips and others have developed systems for the conversion of gaseous hydrocarbon resources into syngas using POX. Each of these systems uses an oxygen input, requiring pressurized oxygen to be delivered to the plant using one of the methods described above. As an example, the Praxair process utilizes a hot oxygen burner that is non-catalytic and converts natural gas (or other hydrocarbons) and oxygen into syngas as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,727,767 (May 2014).",
                        "The conversion of solid-phase and liquid-phase carbonaceous feedstocks, using steam in the absence of oxygen or air, is typically referred to as indirect thermochemical conversion. Steam methane reforming (SMR) is a well-established method for the conversion of gas-phase hydrocarbons to syngas. Since methane is difficult to efficiently steam reform to syngas at temperatures below about 2,200\u00b0 F., catalysts are typically employed to reduce the reforming temperature to about 1,600-1,700\u00b0 F. This process is referred to as catalytic steam reforming and is very efficient for the reforming of other gas-phase hydrocarbons such as C2-C16 hydrocarbons, C1-C16 hydroxy-alkanes and C3-C16 ketones (Sa et al., 2010).",
                        "Table 1 summarizes some potential catalyst contaminants in syngas and their maximum recommended contaminant levels. Numerous methods are available in the current art for the removal of hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen chloride and particulates in syngas.",
                        "Deleterious carboxylic acids can be formed by the reaction of oxygen with free radical species during the catalytic conversion of the syngas with CO and H2. If carboxylic acids are formed, they will be approximately distributed between the liquid fuel, catalyst reaction water and wax as summarized in Table 2. When these carboxylic acids are present in fuels, the fuel can corrode metal surfaces and fuel storage lifetime is reduced considerably. Therefore, these acids need to be removed (if present) from the fuel before distribution, storage and use which is challenging and costly.",
                        "Concurrently, when these carboxylic acids are present in the catalyst reaction water, they need to be removed before the water can be recycled and used for plant processes. In addition to the problem of metal surface corrosion, these acids can damage the catalysts typically used in catalytic steam reforming processes.",
                        "Many techniques are available in the current art for the purification of syngas before catalytic conversion of the syngas to hydrocarbon products. The thermochemical conversion of gas-phase hydrocarbons produces much lower concentrations of syngas contaminants than the conversion of solid carbonaceous materials such as biomass, coal, municipal solid waste, and other solids. Sulfur compounds are the most prevalent contaminants in many gas-phase hydrocarbon resources. These contaminants can be readily removed using a variety of solid-phase binding agents, such as iron oxide or zinc oxide.",
                        "The two primary approaches for the catalytic conversion of syngas to fuels are: 1) catalytic conversion of the syngas to intermediate products (primarily wax), followed by costly wax upgrading and refining processes such as hydrocracking and; 2) direct catalytic conversion of the syngas to fuels that produce minimal wax [U.S. Pat. No. 8,394,862 (August 2013) and U.S. Pat. No. 9,090,831 (July 2015)].",
                        "All of the current medium and large-scale GTL plants convert syngas to wax as the primary product. Refining/upgrading processes are then employed to produce fuels and other products from the wax. Since these refining processes are complex and expensive, fuel production costs can be increased by about 40% or more versus direct fuel production approaches. Medium and large plant designs incorporating traditional F-T processes, that utilize wax hydrocracking and other expensive upgrading processes, are not economically viable for distributed plants that process relatively low volumes of gas-phase hydrocarbons.",
                        "Micro-GTL plants encompass processes that convert about 0.05-2.5 million scf/day of gas-phase hydrocarbons into about 5-250 barrels/day of liquid fuels. GTL plants that convert about 2.5-50 million scf/day of gas-phase hydrocarbons into about 250-5,000 barrels/day of fuel, are typically referred to as small-GTL plants.",
                        "There are several types of catalytic reactors that have been deployed commercially for the catalytic conversion of syngas to hydrocarbon products. Multi-tubular, fixed-bed catalytic reactors are comprised of many small diameter tubes that are used to contain catalysts. These tubes are enclosed inside a reactor shell in which water is circulated to remove the exothermic heat produced from the conversion of syngas to hydrocarbon products. The use of catalysts that produce heavy waxes may coat the catalyst resulting in reduction in catalyst activity. These reactors are operated in a multi-pass mode with removal of the products after each pass and recycling of the unreacted syngas back to the catalytic reactors. Two to three passes through these reactors typically converts about 90 volume % of the CO to hydrocarbon products.",
                        "Slurry reactors employ finely-divided catalysts suspended in a liquid medium. Heat removal is carried out using internal cooling coils. The synthesis gas is bubbled through the liquid medium which also provides agitation of the reactor contents. The small catalyst particle size improves mass transfer of heat to the liquid medium. Wax products must be separated from the catalyst particles.",
                        "Micro-channel reactors consist of reactor cores that contain thousands of thin process channels that are filled with very small particle size catalysts. These reactor cores are interleaved with 0.1-10 mm channels that contain water coolant. Since the catalyst particles and channels are small, heat may be dissipated more quickly than the traditional 25-40 mm tubular reactors.",
                        "Many catalysts and catalytic processes have been developed and deployed for the conversion of syngas to wax. These catalysts are typically referred to as Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) catalysts (Jahangiri et al., 2014). Reported processes describe catalysts that produce high molecular weight hydrocarbon reaction products (e.g., wax) which require further processing, including hydro-processing and other upgrading processes, to produce diesel fuel or diesel blendstock.",
                        "The product stream from the catalytic reactors is generally separated into the following fractions: tail gas; condensed liquid hydrocarbons, catalyst reaction water and waxes using a two or three-phase separator. The tail gas fraction is typically comprised of H2, CO, CO2, C1-C5 hydrocarbons, and oxygenated organic compounds; the condensed fraction comprises C5-C24 hydrocarbons and oxygenated organic compounds; the wax fraction comprises C23-C100+ hydrocarbons; and the catalyst reaction water fraction is comprised of water with up to about 5.0 volume % of dissolved oxygenated organic compounds.",
                        "Since the catalytic conversion efficiency of syngas is typically about 90% or higher when using tubular reactors with tail-gas recycling, some H2 and CO will remain in the tailgas. In addition, the tail-gas contains some CH4 which is produced from the catalytic reaction. The composition of the tail-gas is dependent upon the type of thermochemical process, the catalyst used and operating conditions. This tail-gas can be recycled back to the thermochemical conversion system to produce additional syngas and/or it can be used as burner fuel. Virtually all reported catalytic processes have been used to convert syngas primarily to wax."

Only three, primary modular processes are required including the: 1) syngas purification and syngas generator unit; 2) catalytic reactors and product separation/collection unit; and 3) a facility services unit that includes recycle pumps, process control systems and utilities. This micro-scale GTL plant can economically and efficiently convert from about 0.05-2.5 million scf/day, and even lower gas volumes of 0.00-0.05 million scf/day and higher gas volumes of about 2.5 million scf/day to 10 million scf/day of gas-phase hydrocarbons directly to premium liquid fuels.",
                        "The catalytic reactor is operated at moderate temperatures of 350-450\u00b0 F., preferably 400-425\u00b0 F. and gas hourly space velocities of 100-10,000, preferably 1000-2,500. Since this reactor employs high efficiency steam cooling to rapidly remove heat from the exothermic catalyst reaction, greater than about 70 mole %, preferably greater than about 80 mole % or more preferably greater than 90 mole %, conversion of H2 and CO to products is achieved in a single pass through the multiple catalytic reactors linked in series. This reduces or eliminates costly re-compression and recycling of the catalyst tail-gas back to the catalytic reactors. The catalyst tailgas is recycled back to the syngas generation step to produce additional syngas, is used as burner fuel, is used to generate power, or various combinations of these recycle processes.",
                        "The catalyst produces very little wax (<25 volume %, preferably <5 volume % and more preferably <2 volume % at an average H2/CO ratio of 2.06) and this wax remains as a liquid in the catalytic reactor at the operation temperatures of 400-425\u00b0 F. since it is a light wax consisting of predominantly C22-C35 hydrocarbons. This liquefied wax flows through the catalytic reactors and is either removed from the bottom of the reactors or separated into a drum without obstructing the flow of syngas. Since very little wax is produced, complex and costly refining processes are not needed for the conversion of wax to fuels.",
                        "In one case, the operating conditions of the catalytic reactor may be changed (which may include the H2:CO ratio, gas hourly space velocity, pressure, or temperature) and based on the specific operating conditions the resulting hydrocarbon distribution of the fuel product is changed in order to optimize the fuel products for sale in specific markets. For example, by lowering the H2:CO ratio below 2.0:1.0 the product output will shift the hydrocarbon distribution to a higher molecular weight that may be desirable in some market areas and applications. Conversley, the H2:CO ratio can be increased above 2.0:1.0 to shift the hydrocarbon distribution to a lower molecular weight.",
                        "Since the catalyst reaction water contains undetectable levels of corrosive and detrimental carboxylic acids that are below about 100 ppm, or preferably less than 25 ppm or more preferably less than 15 ppm, the catalyst water can usually be directly recycled and used in the steam reformer. As a result, little or no external water is required for the operation of the plant. The premium fuel is comprised of C5-C24 hydrocarbons which can be used directly in off-road diesel engines, blended at about 20 volume % with traditional petroleum diesel, or easily distilled into various fuel products, depending upon local market requirements."

In this context, undetectable is defined as values that are at or below the detection limit in which the detection limit is the lowest concentration that can be reliably distinguished but is below the level which is quantifiable with acceptable precision. The quantitation limit is the lowest concentration which can not only be detected, but also quantified with a specific degree of precision. The quantitation limit is always greater than the detection limit, usually by a factor of three or four. For example, the detection limit of the GC/MS technique used to quantify the oxygenated hydrocarbons listed in Table 4 was 25 ppm and the quantitation limit was 75-100 ppm. Barely detectable is defined as values between the detection limit and the quantitation limit. Therefore undetectable or barely detectable is defined as <25-100 ppm.",
                        "When the direct fuel production catalyst described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,394,862 (August 2013) and U.S. Pat. No. 9,090,831 (July 2015) is manufactured using a substrate that has close to a neutral surface pH (e.g., a pH of about 7.0) and when the oxygen concentration in the syngas is less than 5,000 ppm, preferably less than 1,000 ppm, and more preferably less than 500 ppm, specific carboxylic acids are not detected above about 100 ppm, and preferably not above about 25 ppm, and more preferably not above about 15 ppm in the catalyst reaction water and liquid fuel fractions.",
                        "Catalyst characteristics include: The catalyst shape is ideally an extrudate with a lobed, fluted, or vaned cross section but could also be a sphere, granule, powder, or other support shape that allows for efficient operation. The use of a lobed structure, for example, enables a significant increase in the ratio of area to volume in the catalytic reactor, thus improving the volumetric efficiency of a catalytic reactor system. The lobed structures also provide an improved pressure drop, which translates into a lower difference in the pressure upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed, especially when they are used in fixed bed reactors.",
                        "The effective pellet radius of a catalyst pellet or support refers to the maximum radius which is a distance from the mid-point of the support to the surface of the support. For lobed supports, the effective pellet radius refers to the minimum distance between the mid-point and the outer surface portion of the pellet. In certain cases, the effective pellet radius is about 600 microns or less. In other cases, the effective pellet radius is about 300 microns or less.",
                        "The catalyst pellet or support material may be porous. In certain cases, the mean surface pore diameter, of the support material is greater than about 100 angstroms. In other cases, it is greater than about 80 angstroms.",
                        "Any suitable material that can have a neutral surface (e.g., a pH of about 7.0) can be used as a support material for the catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch process. Nonlimiting examples of supports include metal oxides such as alumina, silica, zirconia, magnesium or combinations of the metal oxides. Alumina is oftentimes used as the support.",
                        "The catalytically active metals, which are included with or dispersed to the support material, include substances which promote the production of diesel fuel in the catalytic reaction. For example, these metals include cobalt, iron, nickel, or any combinations thereof. Various promoters may be also added to the support material. Examples of promoters include cerium, ruthenium, lanthanum, platinum, rhenium, gold, nickel and rhodium.",
                        "In certain cases, the catalyst support has a crush strength of between about 1 lb./mm and about 10 lbs./mm and a BET surface area of greater than about 75 m2/g. In other cases, the catalyst has a crush strength between about 2 lbs./mm and about 5 lbs./mm and a BET surface area of greater than about 100 m2/g. In still other cases, the catalyst has a crush strength between about 3 lbs./mm and 4 lbs./mm. In still other cases the catalyst has a BET surface area of greater than about 125 m2/g, or 150 m2/g.",
                        "The active metal distribution on the support is typically between about 2% and about 10%. Oftentimes the active metal distribution is between about 3% and about 5% (e.g., about 4%). The active metal distribution is the fraction of the atoms on the catalyst surface that are exposed as expressed by: D=NS/NT, where D is the dispersion, NS is the number of surface atoms, and NT is the total number of atoms of the material. Dispersion increases with decreasing crystallite size.",
                        "In certain cases, a supported catalyst includes cobalt, iron, nickel, or combinations thereof, deposited at between about 5 weight % and 30 weight % on gamma alumina having a neutral surface, more typically about 20 weight % on gamma alumina having a neutral surface, based on the total weight of the supported catalyst. Also in these cases, the supported catalyst formulation includes selected combinations of one or more promoters consisting of ruthenium, palladium, platinum, gold, nickel, rhenium, and combinations thereof in about 0.01-20.0 weight % range, more typically in about 0.1-0.5 weight % range per promoter. Production methods of the catalyst include impregnation and other methods of production commonly used in the industry and are described in the art.",

Table 4 summarizes data for hydroxy-alkanes (e.g. alcohols) and carboxylic acids in catalyst reaction water produced from the catalysis of syngas that was generated by the steam reforming of natural gas, natural gas liquids and glycerol using the catalyst of the present invention. Although the total concentration of hydroxy-alkanes was found to be 12,831 ppm, 16,560 ppm and 18,877 ppm, respectively, for syngas generated from these three feedstocks, acetic acid, propionic acid and malonic acid were undetectable (less than about 25 ppm each) in the catalyst reaction water samples.",
                        "Since the hydroxy-alkanes and carboxylic acids will be distributed between the catalyst reaction water and fuels, the possible presence of carboxylic acids in the liquid fuels can be easily be estimated by employing the ASTM D130 copper strip corrosion test. If carboxylic acids are present then the surface of the copper strip changes color in which a designation of 1a indicates very little or no corrosion to 4c for which the fuel corrodes the copper strip to a dark brown/black color establishing that the fuel contains unacceptable levels of carboxylic acids (ASTM International, 2012). It was determined that the fuels produced directly from these feedstocks provided a 1a test result which confirmed that carboxylic acids were undetectable.",

If the syngas production processes do not require much steam, such as for a reciprocating engine syngas reformer, this catalyst reaction water may be used for the recovery of additional oil from a co-located oil well.",
                        "When oil is present in subterranean rock formations such as sandstone, carbonate, or shale, the oil can generally be exploited by drilling a borehole into the oil-bearing formation and allowing existing pressure gradients to force the oil up the borehole. This process is known as primary recovery. If and when the pressure gradients are insufficient to produce oil at the desired rate, it is customary to carry out an improved recovery method to recover additional oil. This process is known as secondary recovery.",
                        "Even after secondary recovery using water injection, large quantities of the original oil remain in place. The fraction of unrecoverable hydrocarbon is typically highest for heavy oils, tar, and complex geological formations. In large oil fields, more than a billion barrels of oil may be left after conventional water injection.",
                        "Tertiary recovery then becomes the focus. It is estimated that current tertiary oil recovery techniques have the ability to remove an additional 5 to 20 percent of oil remaining in a reservoir. The development of effective tertiary oil recovery strategies for higher oil recovery promises to have a significant economic impact. Current methods of tertiary recover are effective, but expensive since many oil producing locations have limited supplies of water.",

No. 7,559,372 (July 2009)]. However, the addition of mixed alcohols to water for tertiary oil recovery is very costly. Since this catalyst reaction water, produced from the catalyst described in this document, contains up to about 2.0 volume % of C1-C5 alcohols, it is ideal for direct use in tertiary oil recovery.",
