    "title": "Reduction of greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions by direct conversion of associated flare gas to synthetic fuels at oil wellheads",
    "date": "2018-05-14",
    "abstract": "This study describes the results of a \u201cwell-to-wheel\u201d life cycle assessment (LCA) carried out to determine the potential greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emission reductions that could be achieved by converting associated flare gas directly to synthetic fuels at oil wellheads in the US and globally. A Greyrock Flare Gas-to-Fuels\u2122 conversion process at an Ohio oil well was used as the base case for this LCA. The liquid fuel produced directly from associated gas is comprised primarily of premium synthetic diesel with a small amount of synthetic gasoline. In this LCA scenario, the synthetic diesel and synthetic gasoline are blended at 20 and 10 vol% with petroleum diesel and gasoline, respectively. While the synthetic diesel fuel can be used as is (100%), the 20 vol% synthetic diesel blend (with petroleum diesel) was found to significantly improve engine performance, increase fuel economy, and reduce emissions. The direct conversion of associated gas to synthetic diesel fuels globally could reduce emissions of CO2 and CH4 by up to 356 and 5.96 million metric tons/year, respectively, resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by about 113.3 and 92.2% (20 year global warming potential) and 73.8 and 50.7% (100 year global warming potential) for synthetic diesel and gasoline fuels when compared to petroleum-derived gasoline fuels, respectively. Likewise, diesel criteria emissions could be reduced globally by up to 23.3, 0.374, 42.4, and 61.3 million metric tons/year globally for CO, particulates, NOx, and hydrocarbons, respectively. The potential economic benefit of this approach is that up to 5.30 and 71.1 billion liters of synthetic fuels could be produced each year in the US and globally from associated gas, respectively.",

                "Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 900 B.C.E. to evaporate seawater for salt production. By the first century, the Chinese had developed more advanced techniques for tapping underground reservoirs of natural gas, which allowed them to drill wells as deep as 1460 m. They used metal drilling bits inserted through sections of hollowed-out bamboo pipes to reach the gas and bring it to the surface [1].",
                "In 1859, George Bissell and Edwin L. Drake made the first successful use of a boring rig on a well drilled principally to produce oil, at a site on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania. At that time, Bissell and Drake found that large volumes of natural gas (NG) were co-produced when the crude oil was extracted from the ground. This NG has come to be commonly referred to as associated gas which is primarily comprised of methane with minor concentrations of C 2 -C 6 hydrocarbons, nitrogen, and some trace gases such as SO 2 . Since the collection and aggregation of this associated gas for commercial consumption require costly investment, such as pipelines which costs an average of $4.10 million/km during 2014 in the US [2], this gas is usually burned or flared. This combusted-associated gas is typically referred to as flare gas.",
                "Another problem is that many wells are often drilled over a large area during a short period of time, because oil production is subjected to a high depletion rate [3]. Therefore, planning the appropriate infrastructure is challenging for the commercialization of associated gas. As a result, approximately 11.2 and 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) of associated gas are flared in the US and globally each year [4][5][6], respectively, with no energy or commercial benefit. To put this in perspective, if this 150 bcm of gas was converted into power, it could provide more than enough electricity to supply the entire African continent each year.",
                "The composition of associated gas varies depending upon the location of the oil well. Different sources have varying concentrations of CH 4 , gas-phase hydrocarbons (C 2 -C 5 ), condensate (C 5 + hydrocarbons), CO 2, inert gases (N 2 , Ar, He), and contaminants such as H 2 S. Table 1 summarizes some of these differences for a typical oil well in Ohio [7], oil wells in China [8], a characteristic well in Texas, and other wells outside of the US [9]. The gas composition for the Ohio well was used as the base case for this LCA study. CH 4 , CO 2, and the other gases, listed in Table 1, are separated from the crude oil before the oil is piped or transported to refineries. Since there is no market for this associated gas, it is often combusted in flares at the oil production site.",
                "Although CH 4 and CO 2 are the primary greenhouse gases present in associated gas emissions, N 2 O is another potentially potent greenhouse gas, but there are no reliable measurements of N 2 O emissions from associated gas flares at this time. Therefore, N 2 O emissions were not included in this study.",
                "Because all global warming potentials (GWPs) are calculated relative to CO 2 , GWPs based on a shorter timeframe are larger for gases with shorter lifetimes than that of CO 2 . For example, CH 4 , which has a relatively short lifetime compared to CO 2 , the 100-year GWP of 28-36 is much less than the 20-year GWP of 84-87 [10].",
                "Although the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working group typically has used a 100 years in GHG modeling [11,12], the modeling in this paper is focused on a 20-year GWP of 84, since recent models predict significant increases in atmospheric CH 4 and CO 2 concentrations with concomitant increases in global temperatures are expected to occur during the next 15-25 years [13,14]. In addition, the average lifetime of an oil well is about 20 years. Nevertheless, the 100-year GWP was also determined for comparison purposes.",
                "Benzene, formaldehyde, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), NOx, SO 2 , acetaldehyde, and acrolein are also emitted from flaring of the associated gas [15][16][17] in addition to the criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases. It has been estimated that the annual emissions (GHG and non-GHG) from these flares are about the same as the yearly emissions from 70 million cars or about 120 average sized US coal-fired power plants [18].",
                "The \"Zero Routine Flaring by 2030\" initiative introduced by the World Bank is supported by governments, oil and gas companies, universities, and institutes who have recognized that associated gas flaring is unsustainable from both economic and environmental perspectives. Therefore, these global organizations have agreed to collaborate with the objective of significantly reducing routine-associated gas flaring by 2030 [19,20]. However, regulations on gas flaring are set at national and sub-national levels, and therefore, there is wide variation regarding the permissibility of flaring, conditions under which flaring is allowed, and reporting requirements.",
                "In 2018, Elvidge et al. [21] compared 2015 satellitederived gas flaring data with greenhouse gas reduction targets. It was found that Russia and the US could only meet a small portion (< 2.5%) of their gas flaring reduction targets by 2017. They concluded that this was in part due to the absence of regulations on gas flaring and the lack of reliable and cost-effective technologies for the conversion of flare gas to fuels and/or chemicals at the wellhead. The World Bank carried out an evaluation of distributed technologies that had the potential capability of monetizing flare gas by converting it into valuable drop-in fuels and/or chemicals [19]. Greyrock Energy [22][23][24][25] and Oberon Fuels [26] were chosen as the global technology leaders in terms of overall low risk and shortest time to commercialization. Greyrock produces synthetic diesel and synthetic gasoline fuels which are ready to use \"dropin\" fuels, whereas Oberon produces dimethyl ether which is a potential, future clean fuel for diesels.",
                "In 2016, there were about 7500 major gas flares globally that emitted about 150 bcm of associated gas and recent data indicates that global gas flaring may be increasing [20]. However, our study assumes that the number and volume of gas flares will remain relatively constant during the next 20 years which is the time frame for this study.",
                "Although several LCA studies have been carried out to determine the emissions of greenhouse gas emissions produced from natural gas production [27][28][29][30], no work has been carried out to quantify the potential reduction in greenhouse gas and criteria pollutant emissions by direct conversion of associated flare gas to synthetic fuels at the oil wellhead and the use of that fuel regionally. Therefore, the objective of this work was to carry out a comprehensive WTW-LCA to quantify the potential reduction in greenhouse gases and criteria pollutant emissions from associated gas flared at a representative well in Ohio, in the US, and globally, the production of synthetic liquid fuels from the associated gas at the wellhead and the local use of those synthetic fuels in on-the-road vehicles."

Using the assumption that other flares in the US and globally had basically the same average associated gas composition as the Ohio well, then the emission reductions for the US and globally was then determined by multiplying the GHG and criteria pollutant emissions from the Ohio well case by 1319 and 17,710, respectively."

It was estimated that the total associated natural gas production during 2012 was 7.10 bcm from the production of 2.06 billion barrels of oil which amounted to 3.45 m 3 of associated gas produced per barrel of oil [31]. This relationship was used to estimate the total associated gas produced during 2016. Since the US crude oil production during 2016 was 3.24 billion barrels [32], it was estimated that the total associated natural gas production in the US during 2016 was about 11.17 bcm (see Table 2).",
                        "The transmission and storage leakage rate of the associated gas is a function of transmission distance and is scaled by the distance in the GREET model [33]. Associated gas from the wellheads is unprocessed before flaring. In a few cases, associated gas may be combined from several wells that are within an 8 km radius. However, the example used for this LCA is the direct conversion of flare gas to fuels at the base case wellhead located in Ohio. Therefore, the transmission distance for this associated gas was 0.0 km.",
                        "The LCA model used unprocessed associated flare gas at the wellheads as the feedstock for fuel production. As illustrated previously in Table 1, the type, depth, and location of the underground associated gas deposit and the geology of the area dictate the gas composition. Since the associated gas from the wellhead was not processed, any GHG emissions typically associated with gas processing were not included in the LCA models.",
                        "Associated gas emissions from oil wellheads are generated from venting (e.g., leaks) and flaring. Venting and leaks are typically referred to as fugitive emissions. Table 3 summarizes the typical, average fugitive emissions of associated gas generated during oil production at the oil wellhead [34,35]. About 0.85% of the CH 4 in the associated gas is emitted as fugitive emissions during the oil drilling and collection which averages 0.163 g/MJ. Since these associated gas processes require energy, the associated CO 2 emissions are 2.01 g/MJ."

Any adverse contaminants, such as sulfur compounds, are removed 102 from the gas-phase hydrocarbons before input to the syngas generator and/or after the production of the syngas. The contaminant removal process can vary depending on the composition and quantity of contaminants. For this LCA, sulfur species are absorbed over solid phase media, such as zinc oxide.

In addition, the process also generates emissions and waste products.

The Greyrock synthetic diesel fuel meets or exceeds diesel fuel specifications established by ASTM D975, and it has similar chemical and physical properties to diesel fuels typically produced from Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) processes in multi-billion dollar plants operated by Shell and Sasol [40][41][42], except that the Greyrock synthetic diesel fuel has much better lubricity (371 vs. 650 \u00b5m) and higher storage stability (0.1 vs. 0.4) than the Shell and Sasol synthetic diesel fuels. As a result, there is less engine wear when a diesel fuel has a high degree of lubricity, resulting in increased diesel engine life. Since the basic chemical composition of the Greyrock synthetic diesel fuel is very similar to that of the Shell and Sasol synthetic diesel fuels, they perform the same in terms of engine power output, fuel economy, and emission reduction [43]. Since the Greyrock synthetic diesel has a much longer storage lifetime than traditional petroleum diesel fuel, it can be stored for several years without degradation. This extended storage stability is in part, because the Greyrock diesel does not contain interior olefins (2, 3 and 3, 4 olefins) and other fuel constituents that can easily oxidize during storage in fuel tanks and fuel lines [25,44]. It has been confirmed that this fuel is very stable and that no chemical or physical changes occur even when it is stored at room temperature for more than 5 years in ambient light. It is well known that when petroleum diesel degrades during storage, peroxides and deposits are formed which shortens the lifetime of diesel engines [45].",
                        "The Greyrock synthetic diesel has a lower density (0.76 g/ ml compared to 0.84 g/ml for petroleum diesel) and viscosity than current fuels resulting in improved high-pressure fuel injector fuel spray formation, enhanced combustion efficiency, and improved engine performance. Other potential benefits include improved cold starts and fuel economy, reduced warm-up time, fewer misfires and lower exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter [46][47][48][49][50][51][52].",

A cetane of about 51-53 is the optimum cetane value for most diesel engines and increases above this level has a diminishing effect on the improvement of engine operation and reduction in emissions [53,54]. The 20 vol% synthetic diesel blend lowers the concentration of sulfur and aromatics compared to EPA #2 diesel fuel (Table 5) which results in reduced emissions.",
                        "Table 5 also summarizes some of the properties of the synthetic gasoline. The synthetic gasoline has an octane rating of 63 which limits the volume that can be blended with petroleum gasoline. A 10% blend of the synthetic gasoline with 91 octane gasoline results in an octane rating of 89 which is a suitable octane level for more than 95% of gasoline engines. The 10% Greyrock blend has an energy content of 26.54 MJ/L compared to 25.82 MJ/L for petroleum gasoline blended with 10% ethanol. Therefore, although the 10 vol% Greyrock blends should improve fuel economy by 2.7%, engine dynamometer tests have not been carried out to validate this potential improvement in fuel economy. Although the 10 vol% Greyrock synthetic gasoline blend should result in a small reduction in criteria emissions due to lower sulfur and aromatic content, these reductions were not included in the WTW-LCA modeling."

This flare efficiency was primarily established for relatively new flares that incorporated new technologies including air-to-fuel ratio control systems. However, the efficiency of associated gas flares varies from 70 to 99%, depending upon the type and age of the flare, the composition and flow rate of the associated gas; the air-to-fuel ratio of the flare combustion; and atmospheric conditions [56][57][58][59].",

They demonstrated that the concentration of these emissions depends primarily on the ratio of air/fuel (A/F) hydrocarbons in the flare, flare gas composition, and flare combustion efficiency. Table 7 summarizes the effect of three different operating conditions on flare emissions of the associated gas at the base case Ohio oil wellhead using these models. It was found that NOx emissions are higher under lean conditions (Lambda = 1.10) than under rich conditions (Lambda = 0.90), whereas CO emissions are reduced under lean conditions.",

The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) [62] recommended a particulate matter (PM2.5) emission factor of 2.56 g/m 3 or 0.063 g/ MJ, as based on a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) factor for landfill gas flares attributed to filterable PM measurements [63]. These three measurements are in good agreement, and therefore, the average value of 0.061 g/MJ was used in the LCA model. On the average, the PM from flares is comprised of about 90% elemental carbon (black carbon) and 10% solvent extractable materials.",

NOx is comprised of nitrous oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) species. Although N 2 O is 310 times more efficient in terms of global warming than CO 2 [19,20], this gas was not included as a GHG in this LCA study, since its average concentration in flare gas emissions has not been adequately quantified.

Since the primary chemical process for the destruction of CH 4 in the atmosphere is with hydroxy radicals [86], albeit at a much slower rate than with hydrocarbons, the concentration of atmospheric hydroxy radicals will be reduced by these reactions with NOx, SOx, and HCs resulting in an increased lifetime of CH 4 in the atmosphere.  Synthetic diesel fuels are premium fuel products compared to petroleum fuels. These fuels have been demonstrated to improve diesel fuel economy by an average of 1.5% for 1995-2016 diesel vehicles as well as significantly reducing HC, PM, CO, and NOx when used as a 20 vol% blend with petroleum diesel. The Greyrock synthetic fuels have higher cetane content than petroleum fuels (about 75 vs. 45), no sulfur and aromatics, and better fuel lubricity, and they can be stored for much longer periods without degradation than petroleum-based fuels. This improved lubricity results in increased durability, efficiency, and lifetime of light-duty and heavy-duty diesel engines. In addition, the high cetane value of the synthetic fuel improves engine performance and reduces emissions."

Criteria pollutant emission reductions for this 20 vol% blend was used in the LCA models, since this was found to be an optimum blend level for improving vehicle performance and reducing emissions.",
