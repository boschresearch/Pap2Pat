The development of separation technologies for water treatment with high energy efficiency and low environmental impact has become a primary engineering challenge for the 21st century due to the worldwide occurrence of water contamination and the associated negative impacts on the environment and human health. Electrochemically controlled processes, such as capacitive deionization, have emerged as promising candidates for wastewater management and water desalination. However, since these previously developed electrochemical methods rely primarily on the electrostatic interaction between the electrode and the target pollutant, they only work for charged species (e.g., anions, cations). The aforementioned electrochemical methods and systems are not applicable to uncharged organic pollutants, which constitute the majority of industrial and municipal water contaminants, including many dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and carcinogenic aromatics.",

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "The Inventors have recognized and appreciated that developing novel separation strategies for chemical mixtures without using heat may significantly reduce energy consumption, emissions, and pollution worldwide. In the embodiments described, a new approach is taken to water treatment. Herein, the systems and methods employ what is referred to as electrochemically tunable affinity separation (ETAS), which exploits electricity as an external stimulus for control over separation of organics from water. Regarding the implementation of ETAS, the Inventors have developed stimulus-responsive adsorbent systems, with the surface hydrophobicity of a system being programmable by an electrical potential. In some embodiments, an adsorbent displays an electrically-controlled affinity toward neutral organic molecules, facilitating the use of exquisite electrical swing to release and capture organics in a cyclic fashion.",
                        "The global prevalence of water resources contaminated by pollutants (e.g., organic pollutants), such as pesticides, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disrupting compounds, has raised concerns about potential deleterious effects on the environment; particularly aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to organic pollutants has been found to be linked to negative human health effects, including increased predisposition toward diabetes, cancer, infertility, obesity, and other types of endocrine disorders. High separation efficiencies for the removal of organics from water have been achieved using conventional processes such as adsorption, stripping, distillation, and solvent extraction, as well as more recent technologies such as advanced oxidation treatment and membrane separation. However, the overall separation process inherently associated with these methods usually involves energy-intensive steps (e.g., the requirement for high temperature or pressure) and/or environmentally unfriendly processes (e.g., the use of organic solvents and additives leading to the generation of secondary pollutants). It is therefore important to develop water treatment technologies that are more energy efficient and environmentally responsible.",
                        "In some embodiments, ETAS shows higher energy efficiencies and incurs lower environmental costs than established methods for separation of neutral organics from water. This can be attributed to the fact that ETAS operates at room temperature and pressure, requires almost no need for organic solvents and additional chemicals for extraction and/or adsorbent regeneration, and produces no secondary pollutants during operation. According to certain embodiments, ETAS can achieve multiple levels of hydrophobicity and thus affinity towards organics since an external electrical signal (e.g., potential) can be tuned with high precision, permitting a systematic adjustment of a ratio between hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties at the surface of the adsorbent. Such systems that respond to external chemico-physical stimuli offer advanced control with a high degree of tunability and flexibility, enabling a deeper understanding and thus optimization of that process. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobicity, of an ETAS adsorbent can be modulated with a high spatiotemporal resolution. Some ETAS-integrated devices have operational advantages such as modularity, portability, and low cost. In certain embodiments, the ETAS adsorbent displays an electrically programmable affinity toward neutral, uncharged organic species, enabling the cyclic capture and release of organic molecules.",
                        "In some embodiments, the systems, described herein may comprise an adsorbent. In certain embodiments, the adsorbent may function as an electrode (e.g., for electrochemistry). According to certain embodiments, the adsorbent is redox active. In certain embodiments, the adsorbent comprises a nanostructure (e.g., a nanosphere, nanowire, nanoparticle, nanorod, nanofiber, etc.). The nanostructure may be a core-shell nanostructure, according to some embodiments. In some aspects, the core-shell nanostructure may comprise a heterogeneous \u03c0-electron-rich nanostructure comprising a polymer shell (e.g., coating) with redox-tunable hydrophobicity, which is explained in more detail herein. Briefly, such core-shell nanostructures allow for the use of small potential differences to create larger differences in the adsorption capacity between reduced and oxidized states of the adsorbent.",
                        "According to some embodiments, the adsorbent may comprise a carbon cloth (CC). In certain cases, the CC is a flexible and robust substrate comprising bendable carbon nanofibers and/or microfibers. In some embodiments, the adsorbent comprises carbon nanotubes (CNTs). According to some embodiments, the CNTs may be metallic CNTs. In some embodiments, the adsorbent may comprise activated carbon (AC), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes, DWCNTs, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and/or graphene oxide (GO).",
                        "In certain embodiments, the adsorbent may comprise a coating (e.g., a coating associated with the adsorbent). For example, in some embodiments, the adsorbent comprises a CC comprising a coating and/or CNTs comprising a coating. According to some embodiments, the coating comprises an organometallic polymer that comprises an aromatic group. An organometallic polymer may be, in some cases, a polymer containing at least one chemical bond between a carbon atom of an organic molecule and a metal, including alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and Metalloids (e.g. a redox polymer with a metallocene moiety). For example, in some cases, the organometallic polymer comprises polyvinylferrocene (PVF). In certain embodiments, the coating comprises a conducting polymer. A conducting polymer may have a n-conjugated backbone, in certain embodiments. For example, in some cases, the conducting polymer comprises polypyrrole (PPY).",
                        "According to certain embodiments, the coating may comprise a hybrid of polyvinylferrocene/polypyrrole (PVF/PPY). In some embodiments, the PVF/PPY hybrid coating may be fabricated via simultaneous electro-polymerization of pyrrole and electro-deposition of PVF. In certain embodiments, the hybrid coating comprising PVF may be subjected to redox-tunable hydrophobicity by oxidation and/or reduction of the ferrocene moieties. The conjugated PPY chains in the hybrid coating may establish electron transport pathways (e.g., to permit electrical control), in some embodiments.",
                        "In a certain non-limiting embodiment, the adsorbent may comprise a core of metallic CNTs coated with a conformal hybrid coating of PVF/PPY. The metallic CNTs coated with the hybrid coating of PVF/PPY may be formed by electrochemical deposition and/or non-covalent \u03c0 stacking interactions between the three components (e.g., CNTs, PVF, and PPY).",
                        "According to certain embodiments, methods of separating an uncharged organic species from water using the aforementioned adsorbents are described herein. In some embodiments, the method may comprise applying an electrical potential to an adsorbent. When the applied electrical potential (E) is lower than the formal potential of ferrogene (E0=0.32 V), at least a portion of the polymer coating (e.g, at least a portion of ferrocene moieties in PVF) is reduced. In some such embodiments, the ETAS adsorbent is resultantly hydrophobic and has the ability to adsorb a neutral organic species from water. In certain embodiments, when E>>E0; at least a portion of the polymer coating (e.g., at least a portion of ferrocene moieties in PVF) is oxidized. In some such embodiments, ETAS adsorbent becomes relatively hydrophilic and has the ability to desorb a neutral organic species that it has previously adsorbed.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the ratio (R) between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties (e.g., oxidized and reduced ferrocene) can be tuned precisely by the applied potential according to the Nernst equation:",

                        "where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and e is the elementary charge. According to some embodiments, the precise tuning of R therefore enables the programmable adjustment of the adsorbent adsorption affinity for an organic species.",
                        "According to some embodiments, R may be any of a variety of suitable values. For example, in certain embodiments R may be greater than or equal to 0.0, greater than or equal to 0.1, greater than or equal to 0.2, greater than or equal to 0.3, greater than or equal to 0.4, greater than or equal to 0.5, greater than or equal to 0.6, greater than or equal to 0.7, greater than or equal to 0.8, or greater than or equal to 0.9.

Combinations of the above recited ranges are also possible (e.g., R may be greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.9, R may be greater than or equal to 0.4 and less than or equal to 0.6).",
                        "According to certain embodiments, the applied electrical potential is an applied electrochemical potential. The electrochemical potentials described herein may be applied at standard temperature and pressure (e.g., 20\u00b0 C. and 1 atm), indicating the described methods and processes are environmentally friendly and not energy intensive. In some embodiments, the applied electrochemical potential may be a reductive potential or an oxidative potential. In certain embodiments, as the applied electrochemical potential is increased from a reducing potential (e.g., 0.0 V) to an oxidizing potential (e.g., 0.6 V), the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent decreases. The adsorbent may become increasingly hydrophilic at higher (e.g., more oxidizing) potentials at which at least a portion of the polymer coating is oxidized. In some embodiments, as the applied electrochemical potential is decreased from an oxidizing potential (e.g., 0.6 V) to a reducing potential (e.g., 0.0 V), the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases. According to some embodiments, the adsorbent may become increasingly hydrophobic at lower (e.g., more reducing) potentials at which at least a portion of the polymer coating is oxidized. Certain methods for determining the adsorbent adsorption performance are described herein in greater detail below.",

For example, in some embodiments, upon application of a reductive potential, at least a portion of the adsorbent comprising PVF may be reduced, thereby providing an at least partially reduced adsorbent. FIG. 1A shows a schematic diagram of a method of separating an organic species from a feed stream using an adsorbent with an applied potential, according to one set of embodiments. As shown in FIG. 1A, method 100 of separating an organic species (e.g., an uncharged organic species) from water may comprise applying first electrical potential (e.g., reductive potential) 102 to adsorbent 104.",
                        "Any of a variety of suitable reductive potentials may be applied to the adsorbent. According to certain embodiments, the applied reductive potential is greater than or equal to 0.0 V, greater than or equal to 0.05 V, greater than or equal to 0.1 V, or greater than or equal to 0.15 V.

                        "According to some embodiments, the method may comprise contacting an adsorbent with a feed stream.

In certain embodiments, the method may comprise applying the first electrical potential to the adsorbent before and/or while contacting the first adsorbent with the feed stream. In reference to FIG. 1A, the method may comprise applying first electrical potential 102 to adsorbent 104 before and/or while contacting adsorbent 104 with feed stream 106. In some embodiments, the feed stream is successively contacted with an at least partially reduced adsorbent after application of a reducing potential. In some such embodiments, the at least partially reduced adsorbent is at least partially hydrophobic and has the ability to adsorb a neutral organic species from water, which is described in greater detail below. In certain embodiments, the feed stream may comprise water and/or the uncharged organic species.",
                        "The feed stream may have any of a variety of suitable volumes.

                        "Additionally, the feed stream may have any suitable concentration of the organic species. For example, in certain embodiments, the concentration of the organic species in the feed stream may be greater than or equal to 1 mg/L, greater than or equal to 2 mg/L, greater than or equal to 5 mg/L, greater than or equal to 10 mg/L, greater than or equal to 25 mg/L, greater than or equal to 50 mg/L, or greater than or equal to 100 mg/L.

For example, referring to FIG. 1A, the method may comprise adsorbing at least some of organic species 202 into adsorbent 104. According to certain embodiments, the adsorption comprises associating the organic species with the adsorbent by the hydrophobic interaction of the adsorbent. For example, in some aspects, as the adsorbent becomes hydrophobic (e.g., upon application of a reductive potential), the organic species is adsorbed due to the non-affinity of the adsorbent for water in the feed stream. Importantly, in certain embodiments, the hydrophobic interaction of adsorbent is the means for which the Inventors have realized that uncharged organic species can be adsorbed from water.",

The adsorbent may exhibit all the following characteristics: (i) an oxidation-state dependent affinity towards neutral organics, (ii) high porosity for sufficient adsorption capacity, and (iii) high conductivity to permit programmable electrical manipulation instead of merely redox control by chemical species. A carbon cloth (CC) with a conformal hybrid coating of a polyvinylferrocene/polypyrrole (PVF/PPY) was fabricated via simultaneous electro-polymerization of pyrrole and electro-deposition of PVF (see FIG. 3A). In the binary polymer film, the ferrocene moieties in PVF rendered redox-tunable hydrophobicity (e.g., the oxidized ferrocene is significantly more hydrophilic than its reduced form), while the conjugated PPY chains established electron transport pathways to permit electrical control. The CC, composed of bendable carbon microfibers, served as a flexible and robust conductive substrate. PVF, a localized state conductor with discrete redox centers, had a low conductivity (\u02dc10\u22127 S/cm), while the PVF/PPY hybrid exhibited a significantly higher conductivity (24\u00b17 S/cm) measured by the four-probe method. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) (see FIG. 3B) and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) (see FIG. 3C) imaging revealed that the PVF/PPY polymer film was comprised of nano-spheres with diameters of around 20 to 50 nm.

For E>>E0, most ferrocene moieties are oxidized, and the ETAS adsorbent becomes relatively hydrophilic, releasing neutral organics into a water stripping phase.

Significantly better adsorptive performance was found with PVF/PPY (Kd=1.4\u00d7105 mL/g, obtained at Ca=2.5 mg/L) than with PVF (Kd=1.3\u00d7104 mL/g) or PPY (Kd=2.3\u00d7104 mL/g), due to the more porous structure of the hybrid (see FIGS. 18A-18B). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of PVF, PPY, and PVF/PPY were 18, 36, 168 m2/g, respectively. The Kd values around 105 mL/g show superb adsorbent performance.",
                                "FIG. 3F shows that the adsorption isotherm (i.e., Qe versus Ce) of PVF/PPY for SOG could be adjusted systematically through application of different electrochemical potentials. When the applied potential increased from 0 to 0.6 V (all potentials are referenced to Ag/AgCl), the adsorption capacity of PVF/PPY decreased monotonically. The adsorbent became increasingly hydrophilic at higher potentials at which more ferrocene moieties were oxidized. Such electrochemical tunability of the adsorption behavior is important for regeneration of the adsorbent without the use of solvent stripping, and permits cyclic operation of the ETAS-based separation process. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) scans at 0.1 V/s between 0.0 and 0.8 V showed that PVF/PPY could be oxidized and reduced for 300 cycles with negligible loss of the current signal (<1% decrease in the integrated CV area), indicating good electrochemical stability of the hybrid during the cyclic operation. Control experiments show that application of an oxidative potential (0.6 V) did not result in degradation of SOG (see FIG. 17)."

The organic species SOG was removed gradually from a 100 mL feed stream with an initial SOG concentration of 5 mg/L and transferred to a 5 mL receiving stream (e.g., water with no SOG initially). The mass of PVF/PPY on each electrode was 0.12 mg. Two PVF/PPY adsorbents were subjected to alternating oxidation-reduction cycles: at stage 1, the first adsorbent was reduced and the second adsorbent was oxidized, and at stage 2, the polarity of the two adsorbents was reversed. Such a cyclic operation was repeated until stage 24, permitting gradual transfer of SOG from the feed stream to the receiving stream. The feed stream was successively contacted with the reduced adsorbent (e.g., the first adsorbent at stage 1, 3, 5 . . . 23; the second adsorbent at stage 2, 4, 6 . . . 24), whereas the receiving stream was successively contacted with the oxidized adsorbent (i.e., the second adsorbent at stage 1, 3, 5 . . . 23; the first adsorbent at stage 2, 4, 6 . . . 24). FIGS. 4B and 4C show the SOG concentrations in the feed stream and receiving stream (Cr and Ct, respectively), versus the number of stages, using three different potential pairs of a reductive potential to increase the hydrophobicity of PVF/PPY for capturing SOG and an oxidative potential to decrease the hydrophobicity of PVF/PPY for releasing SOG. The directly measured experimental data (open symbols) agreed with the calculated results (solid lines) obtained by numerical solution of the coupled Freundlich isotherms obtained at the paired potentials. This agreement indicates that the ability of ETAS to transfer the pollutant from the feed stream to the receiving stream was the result of the potential-modulated affinity tuning. The net effect of the ETAS cyclic operation was the transfer of SOG from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution. Such a process is not a thermodynamically spontaneous process, and requires additional electrochemical work, which is related to the choice of the potential pair. At any given stage, a larger difference in the potential pair (0.0 V-0.6 V or 0.2 V-0.4 V) yielded lower Cf and higher Cr than did a smaller difference (0.2 V-0.3 V). This indicates that a larger potential difference was more effective in removing SOG from the feed stream and concentrating it in the receiving stream."

                                "The energetic efficiencies should be compared at the same degree of separation and under identical operating conditions. The degree of separation is described by the extent of pollutant removal \u03c8f=Cf,out/Cf,in, where Cf,out is the SOG concentration of the feed stream after a certain number of stages, and Cf,in is the initial SOG concentration of the feed stream. The ratio of the receiving stream and feed stream volumes, \u03b8, is an important parameter determining the overall effectiveness of the separation process; in practice this ratio can be easily tuned and usually needs to be specified to achieve a desired degree of pollutant enrichment in the receiving stream. The \u03c8f-\u03b8-\u03b7 chart (see FIGS. 4D-4F) is introduced as the key metric for quantitative assessment of ETAS performance in terms of the coupled energetic efficiency and separation degree. To compare ETAS performance using different potential pairs, for each chart, the same range of \u03b8 values (from 0.01 to 0.1) and the same number of stages (up to 35) are employed. For a given range of stage numbers and \u03b8, it is desired to have a small \u03c8f and a large \u03b7 simultaneously. On comparison of FIGS. 4D-4F, it is evident that a smaller difference in the paired potentials yielded a higher energetic efficiency. However, the 0.2 V-0.3 V pair had a lower degree of separation than did the 0.2 V-0.4 V and 0.0 V-0.6 V pairs, while the 0.2 V-0.4 V pair yielded the best performance among the three cases in terms of the optimal combination of energetic efficiency and separation degree; even though the 0.0 V-0.6 V pair had essentially the same separation performance as the 0.2 V-0.4 V pair, the larger potential swing led to a higher energetic penalty. Based on the \u03c8f-\u03b8-\u03b7 chart, it is also apparent that with a lower feed to receiving ratio (i.e., a smaller \u03b8), a higher energy efficiency is obtained, but more stages are required to reach a given separation extent."

The separation effectiveness and the energetic efficiency of an ETAS process were improved simultaneously through a generalizable materials design approach in which a ternary heterogeneous nanostructure consisted of a metallic \u03c0-electron-rich CNT core and a binary polymer shell with redox-tunable hydrophobicity. Such a core-shell nanostructure allows for the use of a smaller potential difference to create a larger difference in the adsorption capacity between the reduced and oxidized states. The model ternary nanostructure was developed (see FIG. 5A), and comprised a metallic carbon nanotube (CNT) core with a conformal coating of PVF/PPY (denoted PVF/PPY/CNT), formed by the non-covalent \u03c0-stacking interaction between the three components. To construct the ETAS adsorbent, PVF/PPY/CNT were immobilized on a CC substrate by electrochemical deposition. TEM imaging (see FIG. 5B) shows that PVF/PPY/CNT exhibited a larger average tube diameter (\u02dc50 nm) than that of the unmodified CNT (tube diameter: \u02dc10-15 nm, wall thickness: \u02dc2-4 nm (see FIG. 19). These TEM analyses suggested a conformal polymer coating existed around the nanotubes in the ternary hybrid. EDS elemental mapping of N and Fe (see FIG. 5C) further confirmed that this polymer coating consisted of PPY and PVF. The adsorption isotherm of PVF/PPY/CNT for SOG shows a pronounced dependence on the applied potential (see FIG. 5D). FIGS. 5E-5F show the separation degree (=1\u2212\u03c8f) and energetic efficiency (0, respectively, of PVF/PPY/CNT for selected potential pairs at \u03b8=0.01 with the number of stages=10. The complete \u03c8f-\u03b8-\u03b7 charts of PVF/PPY/CNT are shown in FIG. 20. It is evident that for PVF/PPY/CNT, among the different potential pairs, 0.2 V-0.35 V rendered the best performance that yields both a high separation degree and a high energetic efficiency. Compared to the best-performing case with PVF/PPY operating under 0.2 V-0.4 V, PVF/PPY/CNT operating under 0.2 V-0.35 V, 02 V-0.4 V, and 0.25-0.4 V (marked with * in FIGS. 5E-5F) exhibited simultaneously enhanced separation degree and energetic efficiency.",
                                "The better ETAS performance with PVF/PPY/CNT than with PVF/PPY could be due to the following reasons. First, compared to PVF/PPY, PVF/PPY/CNT had higher adsorption capacities mainly due to its larger BET surface area (243 m2/g) than that of PVF/PPY (168 m2/g). The enhanced adsorption capabilities enabled a higher degree of separation during ETAS operation. Second, incorporation of a conductive CNT core affected the electrochemical behavior of the molecule with redox-tunable hydrophobicity (e.g., ferrocene), resulting in enhanced energetic efficiencies. The relationship between the charge passed upon oxidation from 0 V to the applied potential (see FIG. 5G) shows that ferrocene moieties were oxidized at lower potentials in PVF/PPY/CNT than in PVF/PPY. CV measurements (see FIG. 21) also confirmed a lower ensemble-averaged E0 of ferrocene in PVF/PPY/CNT (0.29 V) than in PVF/PPY (0.39 V). These results show that compared to PVF/PPY, PVF/PPY/CNT could be used with lower potentials to achieve the same extent of increase in hydrophilicity, yielding higher energetic efficiencies. With a uniform spatial distribution of ferrocene sites throughout the polymer film (as evidenced by EDS), a thicker film led to a larger population of ferrocene moieties that were either buried more deeply in an organic PPY environment or were located farther away from the conductive surfaces (either CC or CNT); hence a thicker polymer film results in a higher ensemble-averaged E\u00b0 value. The thickness of a polymer film with uniformly distributed redox centers can be inferred from the slope (Siv) of a ln(CV peak current)\u2212ln(scan rate) plot obtained with a redox polymer electrode (RPE) model to simulate current responses. PVF/PPY/CNT had a larger Siv value (0.88) than did PVF/PPY (0.57) (see FIG. 22), indicating that the former had a more surface-limiting charge transport behavior and thus a thinner polymer film. The RPE simulation requires a knowledge of the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics at the polymer/electrode interface. As illustrated by the energy diagram (see FIG. 5H), CNT had a larger valence band density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (4) compared to CC (pit states, 0 eV-5 eV downward from EF, measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy). This larger DOS shows that CNT could support faster electron transfer kinetics than CC. Gerischer-Marcus theoretical calculations using the valence band DOS show that the use of CNT instead of CC as the electrode surface yielded a 5.4-fold increase in the standard, electron transfer rate constant (k0ET). Incorporation of this difference in k0ET into the RPE simulation produced the Siv versus thickness relation (see FIG. 5I), from which it can be estimated that PVF/PPY/CNT had a smaller average film thickness (303\u00b116 nm) than PVF/PPY (992\u00b148 nm). Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements (see FIG. 23) show that compared to PVF/PPY, PVF/PPY/CNT has smaller charge-transfer resistance and solution resistance, showing that the presence of conductive, nanosized CNTs may facilitate both electron transport and ion diffusion in the ternary hybrid system."

The simulation results are shown in FIGS. 6B-6C for PVF/PPY adsorbents switching between 0.2 V and 0.4 V, expressed in terms of the final concentrations in the feed stream and receiving stream normalized by the initial feed concentration (left axis; \u03c8ct and \u03c8co are for counter-current and co-current operations, respectively) with three separation units for different \u03b8 and \u03be values. The right axis of each panel shows the relative difference in concentration between the counter-current and co-current operations, defined as (\u03c8ct\u2212\u03c8co)/\u03c8co\u00d7100. Simulations with other Nunit values yield similar trends (see FIG. 10). The removal efficiency improves with larger electrode mass loadings, \u03be. The closer the receiving stream volume is to the feed steam volume, the better is the removal effectiveness; this is related to the capacity of the receiving stream for the solute.",
                                "Little difference in performance under co- and counter-current conditions was observed. This is a reflection of the shapes of the isotherms, in which the difference in loadings (\u0394Q) for the electrodes in the adsorption and desorption cells at any stage is almost independent of stage number (see FIG. 11). Simulations were performed for an ETAS adsorbent having linear sorption isotherms Qe (mg/g)=100Ce (mg/L) and Qr=20Ce (mg/L) for the reduced and oxidized states, respectively, with the same set of \u03b8, Nunit, and \u03be values for the nonlinear sorption isotherm case. It is evident that in the linear sorption isotherm case (see FIGS. 6D-6E) the counter-current operation results in markedly improved separation effectiveness over the co-current case, with a lower final feed stream concentration and a higher final receiving stream concentration."

The ETAS adsorbents are applicable to a range of neutral or near-neutral organic water pollutants of varying molecular structure, hydrophobicity, and functionality, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and carcinogenic aromatics. 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2-naphthol (NT), and 1-naphthylamine (NA) are known carcinogenic pollutants, and intermediates for herbicide manufacturing and synthesis of industrial dyes. Bisphenol A (BA) and bisphenol S (BS) are anthropogenic pollutants that appear to be endocrine disruptors with long-term environmental persistence. Metolachlor (MC) is considered to be one of the leading pesticides responsible for groundwater contamination. Ethinyl estradiol (EE) and propranolol hydrochloride (PH) are widely used pharmaceuticals, with the former being a common contraceptive that has led to the collapse of fish populations, and the latter being a \u03b2-blocker for treatment of hypertension. Methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine B (RB) are common industrial dyes identified as municipal water contaminates, particularly in developing countries. FIG. 7A shows the Kd values of these organic pollutants measured at three different potentials (0.0 V, 0.3 V, 0.5 V) using PVF/PPY adsorbents. Pronounced Kd dependences on the applied potential for DCP, NT, NA, BA, BS, MC, EE and PH were observed, indicating that ETAS is suitable for the mitigation of these organic species.",

FIG. 7B shows the heat map of the ratio of Kd between any two organics at three potentials. A ratio significantly different from 1 indicates a high selectivity. Moreover, the ratio and the spatial pattern of the heat map change with the potential. The affinity of the ETAS adsorbent can therefore be tuned towards two competing organics by electrical means, which is a novel strategy for selectivity control. Since the potential of an electrode can be changed locally and independently, the overall selectivity of an ETAS adsorptive system composed of multiple electrodes can be modulated by applying different potentials to different electrodes. To illustrate this point, the selectivity factor (a) for target organics was calculated in the presence of a competitor organic, defined as:",

FIGS. 7C-7F shows a few representative examples of selectivity maps (e.g., values as functions of \u03c90.0 v, \u03c90.3 v and \u03c90.5 v), constructed in a way similar to the typical three-component phase diagram. DCP can be selectively desorbed compared to EE (see FIG. 7C), and SOG can be selectively adsorbed compared to NT (see FIG. 7D). In the presence of PH, SOG can be either selectively adsorbed or desorbed (see FIG. 7E): selective adsorption or desorption of SOG is achieved with \u03c90.0 v=1 or \u03c90.5 v=1. The NT against NA example shows \u03b1 different potential dependence than the SOG against PH (see FIG. 7F): selective adsorption or desorption of NT is achieved with \u03c90.3 v=1 or \u03c90.0 v=1. Such selectivity control is a unique and novel strategy because it is achieved through the use of electrically responsive materials, in which the external stimuli (potential or current) can be delivered to different electrodes locally and independently, without issues associated with mass diffusion or heat dissipation (often encountered when using chemical and thermal stimuli) that hampers such precise delivery over location."

Two types of ETAS adsorbents, carbon cloth (CC)-supported PVF/PPY and PVF/PPY/CNT, were prepared from electrochemical deposition under different conditions.

Such a co-precipitation process occurred due to the strong \u03c0 stacking interactions between the aromatic monomer (i.e., pyrrole) and the cyclopentadiene ring of ferrocene moieties in PVF, generating a nanoporous electro-active binary polymeric surface suitable for ETAS applications. The deposition was performed by chronoamperometry at a potential of 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl for a specified period of time (usually 10 minutes), To prepare the CC-supported PVF/PPY/CNT, 0.1 mg/mL metallic carbon nanotubes was added into the precursor solution followed by sonication for 2 hours prior to electrochemical deposition. The CNT surface consisting of sp2-carbon atoms exhibited non-covalent interactions with PVF and pyrrole, leading to a stable suspension with well-dispersed CNTs after the sonication treatment. The electrochemical deposition was carried out at a potential of 0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl for a specified period of time (usually 15 minutes). Two control samples, CC-supported PVF and CC-supported PPY, were also prepared to compare the adsorption capabilities for organic pollutants. CC-supported PVF was prepared by applying a potential of 0.7 V for 10 minutes versus Ag/AgCl in a chloroform solution containing 2 mg/ml PVF and 0:1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate.

This observation is reasonable since in the ETAS operation, a constant potential was applied instead of a constant current. The redox processes that may lead to water oxidation or proton reduction (thus resulting in a change in pH) occur during the very brief initial charging period (within a few seconds), while the adsorption/desorption process takes a much longer time (a few hours). In other modes of electrochemical separation (e.g., application of a constant current), the water oxidation or proton reduction process is taking place over the entire course of the process, and thus could cause a significant change in the pH of the solution.",

The current responses of a redox-active thin film during potential sweeping processes depend on the thickness of the film, or more specifically, the distances of redox sites from the electrode surface. In order to quantitatively describe such a dependence, a modified redox polymer electrode (RPE) model was used to simulate the voltammetric responses of PVF/PPY hybrid films with varying thicknesses. Briefly, the RPE model assumes that i) at the interface between the electrode surface and the redox-active film, the electron exchange process involves the redox moieties near the electrode, and is described by the Butler-Volmer kinetics, and ii) charge transport in the bulk film is described by diffusion kinetics. Such a model has been used for redox polymer films, and also specifically for PVF films. The redox polymer film is divided into a number of layers with an equal concentration of redox sites contained in each layer, and instantaneous amperometric responses were simulated when the potential of the electrode was linearly scanned. The experimentally observable parameters were the peak currents at different scan rates during cyclic voltammetric scans. Slopes obtained from linear fits of the log(peak current)\u2212log(scan rate) data contained information about the thicknesses of the PVF/PPY hybrid films on the carbon cloth substrate or the carbon nanotube scaffold. From the RPE simulations, relations between the slope and the thickness of the ferrocene-containing film were obtained. The parameters used include: the standard heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant of ferrocene (k0=96 s\u22121 for PVF/PPY on CC) derived from direct measurements of ferrocene monolayers self-assembled on gold and the difference in the density of electronic states between carbon fiber and gold, and 518 s\u22121 for PVF/PPY on the carbon nanotube due to enhanced electron transfer kinetics calculated using Gerisher-Marcus theory), transfer coefficient (a) for the Butler-Volmer kinetic equation (a value of 0.5 is usually assumed for ferrocene), charge transport diffusion coefficient for PVF films with ClO4\u22121 as the anion (Dct=1.06\u00d710\u22129 cm2/s)9, formal potential of ferrocene (E\u00b0=0.39 V for PVF/PPY on CC, and E\u00b0=0.29 V for PVF/PPY on CNT, determined from CV measurements), the thickness for each layer in the RPE model (2 nm), Faraday constant (F=96485.3 C/mol), and the ideal gas constant (R=8.314 J/mol K). Understanding the charge transport processes using the RPE simulations sheds light on the multi-layer nature of a redox-active polymer film, as well as permits a better design and construction of RPEs for several applications in addition to ETAS, such as electrical energy storage, molecular sensing, and electrochemically controlled catalysis.",

Simulations of these processes would allow an assessment to be made of the effects of parameters such as receiving-to-feed volume ratio, electrode mass per volume of feed, number of separation units (Nunit), etc., to optimize the overall design of a separation process for a given task. The systems simulated here are illustrated in FIG. 8 for a co-current multi-unit process, and in FIG. 6A for a counter-current multi-unit process. Both processes are operated in a stop-flow fashion.",

For instance, the feed stream from unit n is fed to the cell in unit n+1 and the receiving stream in unit n is fed to the cell in unit n+1 (for the counter-current operation, it is fed to unit n\u22121). At any given stage, the electrode that had been in equilibrium with the feed stream is transferred to the cell containing the new receiving stream, while the depleted electrode in the receiving stream cell is relocated to the feed stream cell. The electrodes are then activated again to drive the adsorption from the feed stream and desorption to the receiving stream at each unit. The material balances associated with each phase can be used to evaluate the equilibrium concentrations at each unit at the end of each cycle (see FIG. 9).",

In the meantime, the electrode that was in contact with the feed volume in the previous cycle is now contacted with the stripping phase of volume v and initial concentration Cr0, and comes to equilibrium with the electrode, with loading Qr1.

A detailed figure-of-merit comparison is provided between ETAS and the competing separation technology that targets uncharged organics, which is the conventional temperature swing adsorption/desorption methods. Other separation technologies such as distillation and liquid-liquid extraction are not suitable for the recovery/removal of these uncharged organic compounds. The volatilities of these organics are too low for distillation processes to work, and the possible counter-contamination of feed streams with organic solvents makes it unsuitable to employ liquid-liquid extraction to separate these organics. The adsorbent materials used in conventional adsorption processes for removing organic pollutants are carbon nanomaterials, such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene-based materials, and porous metal oxides as adsorbent materials.",
                                "The economics and sustainability of a separation technology should be assessed in the context of an entire chemical process; important factors that need to be considered include the fabrication and replacement costs of key components (e.g., sorbent materials, membrane modules), the capital cost of the equipment, and the energy cost.",
                                "Carbon materials (such as AC used in thermal-swing separation processes) and organic polymeric materials (such as electrochemically active polymers used in ETAS adsorbents) are considered inexpensive materials with low manufacturing costs, compared to other materials such as metal oxides. The industrial scale manufacturing of carbon materials such as AC and CNTs has long been realized, so the production cost of these materials at large scale should be considerably lower than that for the ETAS adsorbents, which are new material systems and their synthesis has been demonstrated on a bench scale. The replacement cost of sorbents materials are associated with their performance stability. The performance stability of carbon-based adsorbents after multiple thermal swing cycles should be compared to the performance stability of electrochemically active polymers-based adsorbents after multiple electrical swing cycles. The regeneration efficiency of carbon adsorbents depends highly on the regeneration conditions, and usually ranges from 70% to almost 100% (e.g., after one thermal swing cycle, the adsorbent performance degrades to 70% to 100% compared to its initial state). For example, for AC-based adsorbents, air activation at 633 K results in a regeneration efficiency of 68% and steam activation at 1123 K can achieve a regeneration efficiency of 94%. Therefore, the optimized regeneration condition for spent carbon adsorbents would make them reusable for multiple cycles. However, during the regeneration process, it is common to have carbon loss of 5% (mass percentage). As a conservative estimation, assuming a regeneration efficiency of 100% and carbon loss of 5%, the performance of carbon adsorbents would decrease by 50% after 13 cycles. On the other hand, for electrochemically active polymers-based adsorbents, their performance stability after multiple electrical swings can be faithfully estimated by investigating the relation between the charge capacity and the number of electrical swing cycles. Over the course of multiple electrical swing cycles (e.g., repeated charging/discharging cycles), several factors might affect the performance stability of electrochemically active polymers, including structural pulverization, shrinkage of polymer backbones, and polymer leaching from conductive substrates. A good stability of the charge capacity indicates the structural integrity of the electrochemically active polymer system. For the PVF/PPY hybrid coating, electrical swing between 0.0 V and 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl for 300 cycles resulted in only 1% charge capacity loss, indicating good stability of the ETAS adsorbent when subject to repeated electric swing cycles.",
                                "The capital cost for separation equipment is usually significant; commonly, 50-90% of the capital of chemical plants is invested into separation units. The adsorption step in both ETAS and thermal-swing adsorption/desorption processes is usually implemented at ambient temperature and pressure, and thus the capital cost of the adsorbers should be comparable between these two separation technologies. However, the thermal-swing separation technology requires high temperatures for the desorption/regeneration step (usually at 500\u00b0 C.-900\u00b0 C.); such high temperature operation demands the employment of costly materials for the equipment such as stainless steel-based alloys, and therefore considerably raises the capital cost of the desorber and its associated pipe networks. In contrast, the regeneration/desorption step in ETAS is carried out under ambient conditions, therefore presumably requiring significantly less capital investment for the equipment. Additionally, ETAS shares common features with other electrochemical separation technologies such as capacitive deionization, and the often-cited advantages of electrochemical equipment include modularity and low cost. Moreover, ETAS can be implemented in a multi-stage cyclic fashion (as demonstrated in FIGS. 4A-4F) using a single separation unit to achieve a specified separation degree, whereas the conventional adsorption process usually requires multiple separation units to achieve the target separation degree. The operation with multiple separation units also increases the capital cost. Hence, considering the factors discussed above, ETAS incurs less capital cost than thermal-swing separation technologies.",
                                "The primary factor that governs the difference in the economic viability between ETAS and the conventional thermal swing separation technology should be the energy cost. In ETAS, the energy cost comes from the electrical swing over the course of ETAS operation whereas in the conventional thermal swing adsorption/desorption process, the primary energy consumption stems from the thermal regeneration of spent, adsorbent materials. The energy consumption is compared quantitatively between ETAS and the thermal swing separation technology based on the scheme illustrated in FIG. 13.",

In ETAS, both adsorption and desorption occur at ambient temperature, so the only energy consumption is from the electricity used for the electrical swing. In the thermal swing separation process, adsorption occurs at ambient temperature while desorption (e.g., the regeneration of spent adsorbents) occurs at high temperature. The pollutant concentration after the Nth adsorption unit can be calculated. If fresh adsorbents are used in each adsorber, there will be the following relationship between CN and CN\u22121 using the mass balance of the pollutant during adsorption:",

To estimate the energy consumption for the thermal swing separation process, a literature survey was conducted on several recently reported carbon materials (such as AC, CNTs, and graphene-based materials) used for water treatment by adsorption for removing various types of organics, and used the reported adsorption isotherm data to calculate the energy consumption.",
                                "One important metric for assessing the energetic efficiency and the overall effectiveness of a separation technology is the energy consumption per unit mass of organics removed (J/g). Based on the calculation scheme described above (see FIG. 13), the energy consumption per unit mass of organics removed was quantified for ETAS operating with different potential pairs (see FIGS. 14A-14B), as well as for the thermal swing adsorption/desorption process using the adsorption isotherms reported previously (see FIG. 15).",
                                "For ETAS operation, it is evident that a smaller difference between the paired potential results in a smaller energy use per gram of organics removed. Also, the use of PVF/PPY/CNT as the ETAS adsorbent is more energetically efficient than the use of PVF/PPY. The ETAS adsorbents require energy consumption around 102 to 103 J/g, whereas the thermal swing approach usually needs energy consumption around 104 J/g. Therefore, the energy efficiency in ETAS is improved by at least one order of magnitude compared to that in the conventional thermal swing separation process. It has been estimated that in US alternative technologies that do not rely on heat could make most separation processes 10 times more energy efficient. To date, separation processes account for about 50% of US industrial energy use and about 15% of the nation's total energy consumption (commercial, transportation, residential, and industrial uses combined). The majority of current separation processes involve the use of heat (such as conventional adsorption and distillation), and thus are energy intensive. These thermal separation methods combined account for 80 percent of the energy consumed for industrial separations, and therefore constitute the most attractive target for improvement. Therefore, the development of separation technologies that do not depend on heat (such as ETAS) would be critical for significant reduction of energy use in US. In fact, it has-been estimated by the US Department of Energy that new, energy efficient separation methods that do not heat, if applied to the US petroleum, chemical and paper manufacturing sectors alone, save 100 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions and 4 billion US dollars in energy costs per year.",
                                "A more practical metric for comparing the economic viability between ETAS and the thermal swing separation technology should consider the cost of the energy source, which is electricity for ETAS and thermal energy for the thermal swing process. Based on the US Department of Energy and Energy Information Administration's national average data, the cost of electricity and heat is about $30.5 and $13.4 per million BTU (British thermal unit, about 0.0003 kilowatt-hours), respectively. Taking these costs into consideration, the cost required to remove one kilogram of organics was calculated (see FIG. 16), as a function of the typical range for the concentration of the organics. Considering the dependence of the energetic cost on the concentration range is important since it is necessary to compare separation technologies in a certain concentration range that is relevant to the target species to be separated. As shown in FIG. 16, ETAS is more economically viable than the conventional thermal swing separation process.",
