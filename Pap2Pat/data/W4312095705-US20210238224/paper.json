    "abstract": "Background Renal fibrosis is the pathological foundation of various chronic kidney diseases progressing to end stage renal failure. However, there are currently no nephroprotective drugs targeted to the fibrotic process in clinical practice. Proteolytic targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which reversibly degrade target proteins through the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, is a novel therapeutic modality. Smad3 is a key pathogenic factor in fibrogenesis while HIF-2\u03b1 exhibits prominent renal protective effects, which is the natural substrate of von Hippel\u2013Lindau (VHL) E3 Ligase. We hypothesied the construction of VHL-recruiting, Smad3-targeting PROTAC might combine the effects of Smad3 degradation and HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization, which not only improving the clinical efficacy of PROTAC but also avoiding its potential off-target effects, could greatly improve the possibility of its translation into clinical drugs. Methods By joining the Smad3-binding small molecule compound (SMC) to VHL-binding SMC with a linker, we designed and synthesized a Smad3-targeting, VHL-based PROTAC. The effects of this PROTAC on targeted proteins were verified both in vitro and in vivo. The toxicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations were conducted with both male and female mice. The renal protection effects and mechanism of PROTAC were evaluated in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mouse model. Results By optimizing the linker and the Smad3-binding SMC, we got a stable and high efficient PROTAC which simultaneously degraded Smad3 and stabilized HIF-2\u03b1 both in vivo and in vitro . The acute toxicity evaluation showed a pretty large therapeutic window of the PROTAC. The prominent renal protection effects and its underlying mechanism including anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory, improving renal anemia and promoting kidney repair, had all been verified in UUO and 5/6Nx mouse model. Conclusion By accurate combination of PROTAC targeted protein and E3 ligase, we got a Smad3-targeting, VHL-recruting PROTAC which caused Smad3 degradation and HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization effects simultaneously, and led to the strong renal function protection effects.",

                "Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is a novel therapeutic modality, which targets protein to degradation via ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway (UPP). A typical PROTAC comprises a moiety specifically binding to a protein of interest (POI), a recognition moiety for E3 ubiquitin ligase and a chemical linker connecting these two parts together [1]. PROTACs mediate the degradation of POIs through proteasome by hijacking the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases to ubiquitinate the POI [2]. Thus, the high efficacy of PROTAC may not only induce the degradation of POI, but also hinder the ubiquitination and degradation of E3 ligase\u2019s natural substrate (ELNS), which could be either beneficial or harmful.",
                "Smad3 has long been widely recognized as the core signal protein of fibrosis. We previously combined computer virtual screening with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and screened out a small molecule compound (SMC) that specifically binds to Smad3. Based on this SMC we constructed a PROTAC which could degrade Smad3 through UPP [3]. Knowing that HIF-2\u03b1 plays a strong reno-protective role in the progression of chronic kidney disease, and protein von Hippel\u2013Lindau (VHL) is a HIF specific E3 ligase [4], we hypothesized that a new PROTAC, connected this Smad3-binding SMC and a VHL-binding SMC with a linker, might have two effects at one time: the degradation of Smad3 as well as the stabilization of HIF-2\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a01A). To verify our hypothesis, we constructed and optimized this VHL-recruting, Smad3-targeting PROTAC, then verified its multiple reno-protective functions both in vitro and in vivo.Fig. 1Mechanism of VHL-recruiting, Smad3-targeting PROTAC. A Schematic of PROTAC-mediated Smad3 degradation and HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization. B The impact of different amount of PROTAC on the degradation of Smad3 recombinat protein was investigated with ACHN whole cell lysate expressing high level of VHL. C PROTAC-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of Smad3 protein via ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. The degradation and ubiquitination on Smad3 protein induced by PROTAC was compared in the absence and presence of MG132 (a specific proteasome inhibitor) with ACHN whole cell lysate expressing high level of VHL"

Then, MG132, a well-known proteasome inhibitor, were added to the ACHN cell lysates in different concentrations and the degradation of Smad3 was rescued accordingly. A slight increase in the molecular weight of Smad3 was observed, which might suggest the ubiquitination of Smad3 (ubiqutin protein molecular weight is 8 KD). To further verify this hypothesis, ubiquitin antibody was used and as we expected that significantly increased ubiquitination bands were only visible in the lanes where MG132 were added along with the PROTAC (Fig.\u00a01C)."

                        "Generally, inhibitors of POI are used as binding moiety of PROTAC. But this strategy is not appropriate for Smad3. Smad3 can only be ubiquitinated after its phosphorylation, while its inhibitor works by hindering it\u2019s phosphorylation. Thus based on our previous work, a new identified Smad3 binding SMC was used as POI binding moiety [3]. Another SMC which binded to VHL specifically was chosen as E3 recognition ligand [5].",
                        "Considering that different linkers may also affect the efficiency of the PROTAC [6], PROTACs were synthesized with two different linkers: (a) PROTAC-Polyethylene Glycol (PEG): longer linker with better flexibility and (b) PROTAC-(CH2COOH)2: shorter linker may have better efficiency in ubiquitination (Fig.\u00a02A). After identification of connection sites between small molecules and linker (Additional file 1: Fig. S1), chemical synthesis of PROTAC was completed by Ontores (Zhejiang, China). The purity and the structure of chemicals were confirmed with the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrum (MS), respectively (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A, B). NRK-49F cells were stimulated with PROTAC-PEG or PROTAC-(CH2COOH)2 in various concentrations. The degradation of Smad3 was more prominent in PROTAC-(CH2COOH)2 stimulated group with a much lower effective concentration (Fig.\u00a02A). Thus, (CH2COOH)2 was chosen as the liker.Fig. 2PROTAC degrades Smad3 and stabilizes HIF-2\u03b1 but not HIF-1\u03b1 in vitro.

The results showed that PROTAC-S was more potent than PROTAC-R not only on the degradation of Smad3 but also on the stabilization of HIF-2\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a02B). Thus, PROTAC-(CH2COOH)2 in S chirality was chosen for the following in-vitro and in-vivo study and referred as PROTAC. The PROTAC is a white lyophilized powder, with molecular weight of 750.8, which was confirmed in blinded-side again with MS (Additional file 1: Fig. S2C)."

The high expression levels of those non-VHL HIF-1\u03b1 E3 ligases suggested that there were non-VHL dependent degradations of HIF-1\u03b1, which might interpret the absent accumulation effect of PROTAC on HIF-1\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a02C, F)."

PROTAC intervention caused improvement in anemia on week 2 and got full correction on week 5. In the Sham group, PROTAC intervention could also significantly increase the levels of RBC count and HGB of the mice without anemia (Fig.\u00a05I, J).",
                        "Erythropoietin hormone (EPO), the main regulator of erythropoiesis, is one of the most important targeted genes of HIF-2\u03b1. Compared with the Sham group, serum EPO level was markedly increased in 5/6Nx group, which was consistent with the partial recovery of anemia. Compared with those 5/6Nx mice treated with vehicle, 5/6Nx mice with PROTAC treatment showed a more significant elevation in serum EPO levels (Fig.\u00a05K). Hepcidin, a strong negative regulator of iron metabolism, was considered as the main reason of iron utilization disorder in renal anemia. ELISA results showed that there were no difference in serum levels of Fe2+ and ferritin between Sham and 5/6Nx groups, but a significantly elevated level of hepcidin in 5/6Nx group could be observed. However, with the PROTAC treatment, hepcidin had a tendency of attenuation, accompanied with a significant increase of Fe2+ and ferritin (Fig.\u00a05L-N). The transcriptional levels of duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), divalent metal transporter1 (DMT1) and ferroportin1 (FPN1), all classic downstream target genes of HIF-2\u03b1 related to intestinal iron absorption ability [11], were also detected. A significant reduction of Dcytb, DMT1 and FPN1 could been seen in 5/6Nx mice indicating the impairment of intestinal iron absorption capacity. PROTAC treatment could significantly elevate the mRNA levels of Dcytb, DMT1 and FPN1 (Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S5) which may work with the elevated EPO to improve the anemia."

                "With the application of SMCs as the moiety of PROTAC, the performance of PROTAC improved and more E3 would be hijacked to POI, which may cause the accumulation of ELNS. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed a PROTAC with two SMCs targeting Smad3 (POI) and VHL (E3) separately. Then a high efficient PROTAC was obtained by optimizing it with different linkers and different chiral configurations of Smad3 connecting SMC. Smad3 degradation and HIF-2\u03b1 stabilization effects of this PROTAC were verified both in vitro and in vivo. Its strong anti-fibrosis activity was confirmed in mouse UUO model, a classic renal interstitial fibrosis model, and prominent renal function protection as well as renal anemia treatment effects were verified in 5/6Nx mouse model, a widely used chronic renal failure model.",
                "Unlike the traditional inhibitors, PROTAC targets protein to degradation via UPP and works in an \u201cevent-driven\u201d mode, which means a transient interaction with the target protein is sufficient for PROTAC to trigger protein degradation. As a result, one PROTAC may repeatedly bind to numerous POIs and thus a much lower concentration is needed for a lasting effect [12]. PROTAC has been reported to degrade various target proteins, even some traditional \u201cuntargeted proteins\u201d [13]. During the past few years, with the widely application of SMCs targeting E3 as ligand to construct PROTAC, the effectiveness of PROTAC in degrading target proteins has been greatly improved. Knowing that all the degradation happened within a limited space and a limited time, exhaustion of specific E3 targeted by PROTAC might happen, then the accumulation of ELNS would not be avoided. As the main regulator of hypoxia, transcription factor HIF-\u03b1 regulates its downstream hypoxia related proteins expression within a few minutes after the sensation of hypoxia. The basis of this extremely rapid response is that HIF-\u03b1 protein levels are regulated by an oxygen-dependent ubiquitination process [14]. Once this high efficient PROTAC hijacks VHL for the degradation of Smad3, it will inevitably lead to the hindrance of HIF-\u03b1 ubiquitination and then accumulation. In fact, the feature of PROTAC leading accumulation of ELNS was also reported with other E3 ligase, which exert a synergistic effects combied with the degradation of POI [15]. So we supposed purposeful choosing moiety to target specific E3, the effect of ELNS stabilization might magnify the therapeutic benefits by working together with the degradation of POIs. Refer to this strategy, we designed and constructed a novel Smad3-targeting, VHL-recruting PROTAC and confirmed its effects on anti-renal fibrosis and renal function-improving.",
                "Finding a satisfactory treatment for renal fibrosis has been a long-standing challenge [16]. TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling is a common pathway involving in renal fibrosis, which contributes to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition [17], tubular epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) [18] and kidney inflammation [19]. Therapeutic strategies targeting Smad3, including genetically inactivation and traditional small molecule inhibitors, have all been confirmed their extraordinary anti-fibrosis and renal protection effects [20\u201323]. However, Smad3 as an indispensable factor in the regulation of a broad spectrum of biological processes, its complete blockage may lead to serious side effects [24, 25]. Traditional inhibitors work by preventing Smad3 from localizing to target locus, thus high systemic drug concentration and continuous exposure are often required in order to get sufficient functional inhibition, which may cause side effects and off-target toxicity during therapy [26]. In contrast, PROTAC could directly degrade Smad3 protein without interference in its mRNA level and could transcriptionally downregulate its fibrotic response, leading to a temporary and reversible inhibition mechanism over traditional inhibitors (Additional file 1: Figs.\u00a0S4, S6).",
                "Importantly, the function of PROTAC is targeting E3 level dependent. Kidney-targeting specificity of our PROTAC is attributed to VHL, an E3 ligase, which mainly found in brain and kidney [27]. Besides, the function of our PROTAC is also Smad3-level dependent, which means that higher level of Smad3 leads to higher efficacy, and thus PROTAC has not much effects on normal tissue in consideration of the limited expression level of Smad3 under normal condition. This is consistent with our result showing that PROTAC treatment had no significant effects on the target protein levels in the control kidneys of UUO mice (Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S3). Therefore, the therapeutic effects of PROTAC was more profound in injured kidneys, because of the higher Smad3 level. These results provide the possibility that patients with kidney diseases might get more benefits from PROTAC treatment.",
                "Notably, the expression of HIF-\u03b1 subtypes in kidney is cell-type specific [28]. Thus, after identifying the expression level of VHL, we needed to confirm the effects of PROTAC on the expression level of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 using tubular cells (HK2) and fibroblasts (NRK-49F) separately (Fig.\u00a02E, F). In addition to cell-type specificity, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 also show differences in their function. HIF-1\u03b1 is indicated as a pro-fibrotic factor since it can increase collagen expression [29, 30]. In contrast, HIF-2\u03b1 shows protective effects against renal fibrosis [31\u201335]. Moreover, the interdependence between HIF-1\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signal pathway has been well studied [36]. The pro-fibrotic function of HIF-1\u03b1 is Smad3-dependent. HIF-1\u03b1-mediated induction of collagen expression relies on the expression of Smad3, in which both Smad3 and HIF-1\u03b1 are needed to translocate in the nucleus to participate in the formation of transcription-regulatory complexes to elicit HIF-1\u03b1 dependent fibrogenesis [37, 38]. Whereas, there was no any evidence of a similar ineraction between HIF-2\u03b1 and Smad3 signaling pathway. One study had investigated the potential relationship between Smad3 and HIF-2\u03b1 by overexpressing HIF-2\u03b1, but there were no detectable effects had been found on the p-Smad3 levels [39]. Based on these characteristics, the degradation of Smad3 could alleviate fibrosis not only by inhibiting TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signaling, but also blocking the pro-fibrotic effect of HIF-1\u03b1, and thus only the benefits of HIF-2\u03b1 left with the treatment of PROTAC. This accurate combination of target proteins could maximize the therapeutic value of the PROTAC.",
                "Moreover, other than VHL E3 ligase, the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1 can also rely on other ubiquitin ligases, such as RACK1, HAF and CHIP [40\u201343], which are highly expressed in renal tubular cells (Fig.\u00a02C). On the contrary, the degradation of HIF-2\u03b1 is restricted to VHL pathway. Once VHL is occupied by PROTAC, the continuously produced HIF-2\u03b1 has no way to degrade, leading to its prominent accumulation. While the degradation of HIF-1\u03b1, depending on other ubiquitin ligases, continues (Fig.\u00a06). A similar phenomenon has also been observed in HIF-PHD 1\u20133 pan inhibitors which mainly up-regulate the level of HIF-2\u03b1 downstream proteins, but not HIF-1\u03b1 [44, 45]. Therefore, treatment with PROTAC could ameliorate fibrogenesis due to the degradation of Smad3 together with the stabilization of HIF-2\u03b1. PROTAC treatment leads a composite protective effects in kidney fibrosis.Fig. 6VHL-based Smad3-targeting PROTAC protects from chronic kidney disease through simultaneously reducing renal fibrosis and promoting renal repair. ECM\u2009=\u2009excessive extracellular matrix, EMT\u2009=\u2009epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition",
                "HIF-2\u03b1 also works as a key regulator in adult erythropoiesis, by activating the EPO gene [46] and increasing iron utilization, both had been demonstrated in HIF-PHD inhibitors previously [10, 47]. Similar effects were also found in our study (Fig.\u00a05K-N). PROTAC treatment could also increase the transcriptional level of Dcytb, DMT1 and FPN1 in duodenum and elevate EPO expression in kidney, while had no obvious effects on the expression level of HIF-1\u03b1 target genes (Transferrin and Transferrin receptor 1) in liver (Additional file 1: Fig.\u00a0S5). Thus, with elevated EPO expression and obvious iron mobilization, renal anemia in 5/6Nx mice was partially corrected after only 2\u00a0weeks of PROTAC treatment and got full correction on week 5 (Fig.\u00a05I, J), which was more quickly than HIF-PHD inhibitors did [48]. Moreover, extramedullary erythropoiesis was observed in the spleen when PROTAC was used in high dosage in our toxicity assay (Fig.\u00a03E). Erythropoiesis mainly takes place in the bone marrow, while the spleen may also produce RBCs under certain conditions. The PHD2-deficient mice displayed HIF-2\u03b1-induced erythrocytosis, accompanied by excessive RBCs, thrombocytopenia and extramedullary erythropoiesis in the spleen, which effects were all HIF-1\u03b1-independent [49]. Thus, the extramedullary erythropoiesis we observed might be induced by increased EPO via HIF-2\u03b1 activation. The relatively short administration time of our toxicity assay might account for the absence of change of peripheral RBCs (Additional file 2: Table S1).",
                "Although this PROTAC has shown great success in renal fibrosis mice models, its exactly working mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Since Smad3 is ubiquitously expressed and our study has been mainly focused on renal interstitium, the evaluation of Smad3 and HIF-2\u03b1 protein levels with PROTAC treatment in other cells/tissues were still needed in the future study. Besides, as a precursor of medicine, whether it has long-term toxic effects still needs to be explored."
