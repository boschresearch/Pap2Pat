    "title": "Mitochondrial Regulation of the Hippocampal Firing Rate Set Point and Seizure Susceptibility",
    "date": "2019-06-01",
    "abstract": "Maintaining average activity within a set-point range constitutes a fundamental property of central neural circuits. However, whether and how activity set points are regulated remains unknown. Integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling and experimental study of neuronal homeostasis, we identified mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) as a regulator of activity set points in hippocampal networks. The DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide stably suppressed mean firing rates via synaptic and intrinsic excitability mechanisms by modulating mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering and spare respiratory capacity. Bi-directional activity perturbations under DHODH blockade triggered firing rate compensation, while stabilizing firing to the lower level, indicating a change in the firing rate set point. In vivo, teriflunomide decreased CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission and CA1 mean firing rate and attenuated susceptibility to seizures, even in the intractable Dravet syndrome epilepsy model. Our results uncover mitochondria as a key regulator of activity set points, demonstrate the differential regulation of set points and compensatory mechanisms, and propose a new strategy to treat epilepsy.",

                "How neurons and neural networks maintain average activity levels in a stable regime remains one of the most challenging questions in neuroscience. Since the time of Claude Bernard (Bernard, 1870) and Walter Cannon (Cannon, 1929), scientists have been searching for the core molecular machinery that is at the root of cellular, network, and system-level homeostasis. Although understanding of homeostatic regulation of neural circuits has evolved since its original formulation (Davis, 2006, Marder and Goaillard, 2006, Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004), the core concept encompasses the idea that the internal milieu operates optimally when a regulated physiological variable is kept stable by multiple coordinated mechanisms despite ongoing external or internal variations. A number of models have adopted concepts from engineering control theory to physiological regulation in general (Wiener, 1948) and to neuronal activity regulation in particular (Davis, 2006). According to the control theory, several principle features characterize a system under homeostatic regulation: a set point that defines the output of the system, sensors that detect a deviation from a set point, and effectors that precisely retarget the set point via negative feedback.",
                "Although the concept of a \u201cset point\u201d was proposed by James Hardy 65 years ago (Hardy, 1953\u20131954) and the existence of an activity set point is widely assumed in neurophysiology, our understanding of set-point establishment is still rudimentary. Accumulated evidence suggests that the mean firing rate (MFR), reflecting an average level of spontaneous spiking activity over extended timescales, represents a physiological variable regulated by homeostatic systems in central neural circuits. Pharmacological, genetic, or experience-dependent perturbations can lead to a rapid change in the MFR that is gradually returned to a set-point level despite the constant presence of a perturbation. This has been shown in cultured neural networks ex\u00a0vivo (Burrone et\u00a0al., 2002, Slomowitz et\u00a0al., 2015, Turrigiano et\u00a0al., 1998, Vertkin et\u00a0al., 2015) and in primary visual cortex in\u00a0vivo (Hengen et\u00a0al., 2013, Hengen et\u00a0al., 2016, Keck et\u00a0al., 2013). In a given circuit, the same firing properties can arise from a large number of fine-tuned parameters, regulating synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties (Marder and Goaillard, 2006, Prinz et\u00a0al., 2004). A wide repertoire of homeostatic effector mechanisms that operate at the level of excitatory synapses, inhibitory synapses, and intrinsic excitability enable firing rate renormalization to a circuit-specific MFR set point following perturbations (Davis, 2013, Keck et\u00a0al., 2017, Maffei and Fontanini, 2009, Pozo and Goda, 2010, Turrigiano, 2011). However, some central questions have remained open. What are the mechanisms that establish the specific values of MFR set points? Are MFR set points fixed (predetermined) or adjustable in central neural circuits? If they are adjustable, do separate mechanisms control negative feedback responses and MFR set-point value? And finally, can re-adjustment of dysregulated firing set points provide a new conceptual way to treat brain disorders associated with aberrant network activity?",
                "We have recently hypothesized that metabolic signaling constitutes a core regulatory module of MFR homeostasis (Frere and Slutsky, 2018). However, the link between neuronal metabolism and MFR homeostasis has remained unexplored. Our in silico transcriptome metabolic modeling analysis uncovered mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme as the leading target that rescues metabolic homeostasis of hyperexcitable hippocampal circuits. Using state-of-the-art optical, electrophysiological, and metabolic tools, we identified mitochondria as a central regulator of firing rate set points in hippocampal circuits and DHODH inhibition as a novel strategy to treat epilepsy."

                        "To identify the core molecular targets that regulate metabolic network homeostasis in hippocampal circuits, we used genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSMM; Figure\u00a01A). GSMM has already shown its value in the modeling of human metabolism in health and disease (Duarte et\u00a0al., 2007, Shlomi et\u00a0al., 2008, Thiele et\u00a0al., 2013), including brain metabolism (Lewis et\u00a0al., 2010). As epilepsy represents a disorder associated with destabilized neuronal activity patterns and metabolic impairments (Lutas and Yellen, 2013, Scharfman, 2015, Zsurka and Kunz, 2015), we hypothesized that a metabolic modeling analysis of epilepsy-associated transcriptome may be useful to predict gene targets linking metabolic and firing homeostasis networks. Accordingly, we analyzed available cortical and hippocampal transcriptome datasets of human epilepsy patients (Delahaye-Duriez et\u00a0al., 2016), chronic stages of pilocarpine (Okamoto et\u00a0al., 2010), and kainate (Winden et\u00a0al., 2011) rat epilepsy models (Table S1). We first integrated the above transcriptome data within the human metabolic model using iMAT (the Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool) to predict the likely metabolic flux activity in each of the diseases or states mentioned above (Shlomi et\u00a0al., 2008). The iMAT outputs were subsequently analyzed using a generic metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA), searching for gene perturbations that are most likely to transform a given metabolic state to a desired target one by conducting in silico knockout screen of all metabolic genes (Yizhak et\u00a0al., 2013). That is, in our case we applied the MTA to search for gene perturbations that are most likely to transform the epileptic disease metabolic state back to a healthy one (Figure\u00a01B; Table S3). We found a significant overlap between the MTA predictions and the known seizure-predisposing gene knockouts (Table S2). In addition, our analysis showed a high degree of overlap between prediction set pairs as well as across all analyzed datasets (Figure\u00a01B; Table S4). Specifically, our analysis pointed to the mitochondrial enzyme DHODH as one of the top predicted targets (Figure\u00a01C; Table S3) that transforms toward epilepsy-resistant metabolic state, further confirmed by applying the MTA to the analysis of a ketogenic diet (Table S4; Bough et\u00a0al., 2006). Hence, we decided to experimentally study the role of DHODH.Figure\u00a01The Leading Computational Prediction, DHODH, Regulates Spontaneous Spiking Rate in Hippocampal Networks(A) Schematic of computational analysis workflow.(B) Diagram showing overlap in genes that pass selection criteria (see STAR Methods) in each test group.

                        "DHODH is located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria (Jones, 1980) and links two major intracellular processes: the fourth reaction of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (oxidation of dihydroorotate [DHO] to orotate) and electron transfer from DHO to ubiquinone as part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Evans and Guy, 2004; Figure\u00a0S1A). To explore the role of DHODH in regulation of neuronal activity, we tested the effect of teriflunomide (TERI), a specific, uncompetitive DHODH inhibitor (Bruneau et\u00a0al., 1998), on the firing properties of high-density hippocampal cultures grown on a multi-electrode array (MEA) for \u223c3\u00a0weeks. Each MEA contains 120 recording electrodes, each capable of recording the activity of several adjacent neurons (Figure\u00a01D). Spontaneous spiking activity was continuously monitored in an incubator chamber during a baseline recording period and for 2\u00a0days following application of 50\u00a0\u03bcM TERI. TERI application caused a pronounced drop in firing rates (Figures 1E\u20131G) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure\u00a0S1B). Surprisingly, the lower MFR induced by TERI was stable during 2\u00a0days in the presence of the drug, stabilizing at \u223c60% reduction (Figures 1F and 1G). No sign of homeostatic compensation was observed during 2\u00a0days of recordings, as expected for typical activity-dependent (Slomowitz et\u00a0al., 2015, Vertkin et\u00a0al., 2015) or experience-dependent (Hengen et\u00a0al., 2013, Hengen et\u00a0al., 2016, Keck et\u00a0al., 2013) perturbations. Nevertheless, the effect of TERI on MFR was reversible, as removal of the drug after 2\u00a0days restored the original MFR (Figure\u00a0S1C). Furthermore, TERI efficiently and reversibly inhibited CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission in acute hippocampal slices (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] of \u223c54\u00a0\u03bcM) by decreasing the amplitude and the frequency of\u00a0quantal excitatory synaptic transmission (Figure\u00a0S2). Thus,\u00a0reduction in basal excitatory synaptic transmission may contribute to TERI-induced inhibition of spontaneous firing rates.",
                        "To verify that TERI\u2019s inhibitory effect on spontaneous spiking activity is mediated via DHODH, we used a lentiviral-based short hairpin (shRNA) delivery methodology to knock down endogenous DHODH. Knockdown (KD) of DHODH by the effective shDHODH (\u223c80% KD; Figure\u00a01H; Figure\u00a0S3) caused a reduction of \u223c34% in the MFR in comparison with the control hairpin (shScr; Figure\u00a01I) and occluded the inhibitory effect of TERI on MFR (Figures 1J and 1K). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the stable reduction of MFRs by TERI is mediated via DHODH inhibition and not by off targets of the drug."

                        "DHODH catalyzes the conversion of DHO to orotate in the endogenous synthesis of UMP (Figure\u00a0S1A). Treatment of hippocampal cultures for 2\u00a0days with TERI led to a dramatic accumulation of DHO levels measured by mass spectrometry (Figure\u00a02A), in agreement with inhibition of DHODH enzymatic activity. Notably, 2\u00a0days of TERI treatment did not alter the steady-state intracellular levels of uridine (Figure\u00a02B), the end product of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, indicating that DHODH is not necessary to maintain normal intracellular levels of uridine in neurons. Moreover, uridine supplementation (100\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly increased intracellular uridine levels (Figure\u00a02B), without abrogating the inhibitory effect of TERI on MFRs (Figure\u00a02C). Together, these findings demonstrate that stable reduction in firing rates by DHODH inhibition does not depend on pyrimidine levels.Figure\u00a02TERI Decreases Spare Respiratory Capacity without Hampering Pyrimidine and ATP Levels(A and B) LC-MS/MS analysis of pyrimidine metabolism.(A) Treatment of hippocampal cultures with 50\u00a0\u03bcM TERI resulted in a gradual accumulation of intracellular DHO (n\u00a0= 3 or 4 separate coverslips).

Blocking mitochondrial functions by the mitochondrial uncoupler Bam15 (Kenwood et\u00a0al., 2013), in combination with the ATP synthase blocker oligomycin (to prevent reversal of ATP-ase), inhibited CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission and occluded the effect of TERI (Bam15+Oligo; Figures S4A\u2013S4C). Moreover, Bam15 reduced MFR and occluded the effect of\u00a0TERI on MFR in MEA recordings (Figure\u00a0S4D). Addition of Bam15+Oligo after TERI produced an additional inhibition of synaptic transmission (Figures S4E and S4F), indicating that TERI only partially inhibits specific mitochondrial functions, while Bam15 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) caused mitochondrial uncoupling (Kenwood et\u00a0al., 2013), nonspecifically impairing several mitochondrial functions.",
                        "To directly examine the link between DHODH activity and mitochondria functions, we first set out to assess the effect of TERI on oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of mitochondrial respiratory activity, using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer (Qian and Van Houten, 2010). Short-term application of TERI (100\u00a0\u03bcM) decreased spare respiratory capacity (Figures 2D and 2F), defined as the difference between basal and maximal respiration. Importantly, spare respiratory capacity remained attenuated for 2\u00a0days of TERI application (Figures 2E and 2F; Figure\u00a0S5B). Similar results were obtained with 50\u00a0\u03bcM TERI (Figures S5A and S5B). Moreover, mtDNA copy number, reflecting mitochondrial mass, remained unaffected following chronic DHODH inhibition (Figure\u00a0S5C), indicating that the decreased spare respiratory capacity was not the result of a smaller number of mitochondria. In contrast, the coupling efficiency of energy derived from oxidation to oligomycin-sensitive ATP-linked respiration was unaltered following acute and chronic application of TERI (Figures 2G\u20132I; Figures S5A and S5B). Furthermore, TERI did not affect presynaptic ATP levels, assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements (Figures 2K and 2L). Non-mitochondrial respiration was not affected at any time point of TERI incubation (Figure\u00a02J).",
                        "Taken together, these results indicate that DHODH inhibition stably decreases mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity without inducing compensatory mechanisms. Notably, reduction in spare respiratory capacity did not limit the ability of neurons to fire under high demand, as indicated by an 8.3-fold increase in MFR following blockade of GABAA receptors in TERI-treated neurons (Figure\u00a0S5D)."

As mitochondria have been recently shown to shape cytosolic Ca2+ (cyto-Ca2+) in hippocampal terminals (Gazit et\u00a0al., 2016, Kwon et\u00a0al., 2016), we tested how DHODH activity affects presynaptic Ca2+ buffering. Acute TERI application caused a decrease in action potential (AP)-induced presynaptic Ca2+ transients measured by Oregon green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (OGB-1 AM) that remained stable for 2\u00a0days (Figures 3A and 3B). This was accompanied by a reversible increase in resting cyto-Ca2+ levels (Figures S6A and S6B). Mitochondrial blockers (Bam15+Oligo) decreased presynaptic Ca2+ transients and occluded the effect of TERI (Figures 3C and 3D), implicating mitochondrial DHODH in regulation of the presynaptic Ca2+ transients. To directly assess the role of mitochondria in regulation of Ca2+ transients, we measured the effect of TERI on mitochondrial Ca2+ (mito-Ca2+) using the highly sensitive, genetically encoded Ca2+ probe\u00a0GCaMP6m (Chen et\u00a0al., 2013) efficiently targeted to mitochondria (2mtGCaMP6m; Gazit et\u00a0al., 2016). 2mtGCaMP6m colocalized with the mitochondrial marker (mCherry-mito) in hippocampal neurons (Figure\u00a0S6C). Indeed, application of TERI caused a reversible \u223c60% decrease in resting mito-Ca2+ (Figures 3E and 3F; Figure\u00a0S6D). This TERI-induced reduction in resting mito-Ca2+ was accompanied by an increase in AP-evoked mito-Ca2+ for bursts (five APs at 50\u00a0Hz; Figures 3G\u20133I) and for single APs (Figure\u00a0S6E). Taken together, these results suggest that DHODH inhibition suppresses AP-evoked cyto-Ca2+ transients by facilitating mito-Ca2+ buffering during spiking activity at hippocampal boutons.Figure\u00a03TERI Enhances Mito-Ca2+ Buffering during Spiking Activity(A and B) Effect of TERI (50\u00a0\u03bcM) on AP-evoked presynaptic cyto-Ca2+ transients measured by OGB-1AM.(A) Representative traces of Ca2+ transients in one experiment evoked by 0.1\u00a0Hz stimulation during 500\u00a0Hz line scan at boutons and quantified as \u0394F/F (average of\u00a0ten traces) showing acute (30\u00a0min) and long-term (2\u00a0days) effect of TERI.

                        "What are the functional rearrangements in network activity that\u00a0underlie sustained reduction in spontaneous firing? To answer this question, we first assessed whether intrinsic excitability is\u00a0changed after DHODH inhibition. We elicited APs in response to increasing somatic current injections ranging from 0 to\u00a0+600\u00a0pA (F-I curves) in the presence of postsynaptic receptor blockers (Figure\u00a04A). TERI elicited a reduction in response to higher current injections, resulting in a sharp reduction in the maximal firing frequency after 4\u00a0h that remained low during 2\u00a0days (Figures 4A and 4B). Moreover, DHODH KD occluded the effect of TERI (Figures S7A and S7B), confirming that reduction in maximal firing frequency by TERI is mediated by DHODH. Input resistance, AP threshold, and AP width and amplitude showed no significant change following TERI application (Figures S7C\u2013S7F). Next, we examined the effect of DHODH inhibition on adaptions of excitatory synapses. TERI induced a pronounced reduction in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude following 2\u00a0days of incubation (Figures 4C and 4D) and significant, but moderate, reduction in mEPSC frequency (Figures 4C and 4E). These data indicate that DHODH inhibition does not activate typical compensatory mechanisms, leading to the sustained reduction in MFRs.Figure\u00a04DHODH Inhibition Reduces Intrinsic Excitability and mEPSC(A) Representative traces of voltage responses evoked by 20\u00a0pA step of current injections in control, after 4\u00a0h and 2\u00a0day TERI incubation in hippocampal cultures.

                        "These results raise the question of whether feedback regulation mechanisms are completely disabled by DHODH inhibition. If so, the network will be incapable of regulating its own activity against future perturbations. Another possibility is that regulatory feedback mechanisms are still active, yet they are \u201ctuned\u201d to a lower level of activity. In this scenario, further perturbations will induce compensatory responses to sustain its current low activity state (Styr and Slutsky, 2018). However, whether firing set points are adjustable and whether compensatory responses and the set points are separately controlled is unknown. Our previous work has demonstrated a renormalization of the MFR to a set-point level following firing inhibition by a GABAB receptor agonist baclofen through intrinsic and synaptic adaptive mechanisms (Slomowitz et\u00a0al., 2015). Here, we used this assay to determine whether activity-dependent compensatory feedback mechanisms are still active under DHODH inhibition. Therefore, we added 10\u00a0\u03bcM baclofen following 2\u00a0days of incubation with TERI (Figures 5A\u20135C). Addition of baclofen in the presence of TERI induced a transient reduction of the MFR that was gradually corrected over a 2\u00a0day period. The adaption stabilized at the new, lower steady-state level established following TERI application (Figures 5A and 5B). The lower set point was reestablished in each network according to its own steady state (Figures S8A and S8B), as well as on average across all the experiments (Figure\u00a05C). Importantly, partial mitochondrial uncoupling by low concentration of Bam15 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) caused a stable, \u223c42% reduction in the MFR but impaired MFR renormalization following baclofen application (Figures S8C\u2013S8E). These experiments indicate that inhibition of specific, DHODH-dependent mitochondrial functions is critical for lowering MFR set point without impairing homeostatic feedback responses.Figure\u00a05DHODH Regulates MFR Set Points Independently of Compensatory Feedback Mechanisms(A) Raster plots showing reduction of MFR after 2\u00a0days of 50\u00a0\u03bcM TERI application, acute reduction of MFR after 10\u00a0\u03bcM baclofen application in the presence of TERI, and recovery of spiking activity after 2 more days in the presence of both TERI and baclofen.(B) Time course of MFR reduction after TERI and renormalization of MFR after baclofen to a new, lower set point (n\u00a0= 4 experiments, 270 channels).(C) Average MFR data across 270 channels (same experiments as in B).(D) Time course of MFR reduction after TERI and renormalization of MFR after TBOA back to the new, lower set point (n\u00a0= 4 experiments, 299 channels).(E) Average MFR data across 299 channels (same experiments as in D).One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparisons test (C and E). \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01 and \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; ns, non-significant (p > 0.05).

                        "If DHODH is a bona fide regulator of activity set points, MFR\u00a0renormalization to a new set-point value should occur for bi-directional changes in activity. To test this prediction, we induced chronic hyperactivity in DHODH-inhibited neurons by enhancing glutamate spillover via inhibition of glutamate transporters (Asztely et\u00a0al., 1997). Notably, addition of 10\u00a0\u03bcM TBOA, a subsaturating concentration of the competitive glutamate transporter antagonist (Christie and Jahr, 2006), following 1\u00a0day of incubation with TERI induced a transient increase in MFR that was gradually renormalized during the following day to the new set-point value (Figures 5D and 5E). These results demonstrate that homeostatic compensation mechanisms are still active under DHODH inhibition yet are tuned to drive the steady state of the network to a new, lower set-point level for bi-directional activity perturbations."

Because TERI does not cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently (Vidal-Jordana et\u00a0al., 2015), we performed intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of TERI (27\u00a0\u03bcg in 1\u00a0\u03bcL) versus vehicle (VEH; 1\u00a0\u03bcL). We recorded single-unit activity in behaving adult mice with chronically implanted tetrodes (Figures S9A\u2013S9C). Compared with baseline, i.c.v. TERI injection caused a stable decrease of \u223c60% in the MFR of CA1 neurons (Figures 6A\u20136C). In contrast, similar amount of VEH did not affect the MFR across several hours of recording (Figure\u00a06D; Figure\u00a0S9D).

First, we used a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) mouse model, one of the most widely used animal seizure models in the search for new antiepileptic drugs (Bialer and White, 2010). Pretreatment with i.c.v. injections of TERI for 3\u00a0days significantly reduced the cumulative PTZ revised Racine scores (Figure\u00a07A) and the fraction of mice reaching Racine stage 4 at any point during the first 30\u00a0min following PTZ injection (Figure\u00a07B). Furthermore, the fraction of mice that developed generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures was reduced from 57% to 15% by TERI treatment (Figure\u00a07C), as well as seizure susceptibility (Figure\u00a07D). These results demonstrate antiepileptic protection by cerebral DHODH inhibition against induced seizures in an acute PTZ model of epilepsy.Figure\u00a07TERI Reduces Susceptibility to PTZ-Induced Seizures(A\u2013D) Effect of TERI on PTZ epilepsy model.

                        "To test how DHODH inhibition regulates cyto- and mito-Ca2+ levels in hyperexcitable hippocampal neurons, we analyzed the effect of PTZ in VEH- versus TERI-pretreated neuronal cultures. We performed time-lapse, simultaneous imaging of cyto- and mito-Ca2+ transients in somata of hippocampal neurons before and after PTZ application. Ca2+ dynamics in the cytosol were measured using a red-shifted jRGECO1a sensor and Ca2+ in\u00a0mitochondria using 2mtGCaMP6m. Application of PTZ to cultured hippocampal neurons triggered a massive increase in both mito-Ca2+ and cyto-Ca2+ (Figures 7F\u20138I; Figure\u00a0S10A). Accumulation of mito-Ca2+ by PTZ was dependent on an increase in spiking activity, as TTX abolished PTZ-induced mito-Ca2+ augmentation (Figure\u00a0S10B). Indeed, high-frequency electrical stimulation, mimicking PTZ-induced spontaneous bursts, also triggered an accumulation of mito-Ca2+, accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude of mito-Ca2+ responses (Figure\u00a0S10C). Moreover, increases in cyto-Ca2+ and mito-Ca2+ levels were highly correlated per neuron following PTZ application (Figure\u00a0S10D). We also obtained similar results using a lower affinity probe (mtRCaMP1h; Figure\u00a0S10E), suggesting that these\u00a0results are not due to probe saturation and have a biological origin. As expected from inhibitory long-term effects of TERI on intrinsic neuronal excitability and on synaptic excitatory currents (Figure\u00a04), TERI preincubation diminished cyto-Ca2+ accumulation by PTZ (Figures 7F and 7G). Thus, in\u00a0TERI-treated neurons, lower cyto-Ca2+ events resulted in attenuated mito-Ca2+ levels at different time points of PTZ application (Figures 7H and 7I), probably because of smaller Ca2+ fluxes into mitochondria. Because mito-Ca2+ overload has been associated with seizure activity (Folbergrov\u00e1 and Kunz, 2012) and neuronal death (Orrenius et\u00a0al., 2003), decreased Ca2+ accumulation in the mitochondria may contribute to antiepileptic effects of TERI.Figure\u00a08TERI Reduces the Frequency of Interictal Spikes and the Susceptibility to Thermally Induced Seizures in the Mouse Model of DS(A) MTA analysis of hippocampal RNA sequencing data in DS model Scn1a+/\u2212 mice (Hawkins et\u00a0al., 2019).

Epilepsy in DS patients begins in the first year of life with febrile seizures that progress to refractory seizures and frequent episodes of status epilepticus (Dravet, 2011). More than 80% of patients diagnosed with DS carry a de novo mutation within the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN1A (Catterall et\u00a0al., 2010, Zuberi et\u00a0al., 2011).",

To test whether DHODH inhibition indeed provides protection to adult DS mice, we used a knockin DS mouse model carrying the Scn1a-A1783V mutation (Alonso G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al., 2018). Similarly to other DS mouse models, these mice exhibited thermally induced seizures and profound premature death, with less than 40% that survive beyond the sixth week of life (Figure\u00a0S11A).

The temperature threshold for seizure induction was 37.05\u00a0\u00b1 0.26\u00b0C in the VEH-treated group, compared with 38.59\u00b0C\u00a0\u00b1 0.33\u00b0C in TERI-treated group (Figures 8F and 8G). Thus, TERI decreased the susceptibility for thermally induced seizures in DS mice. Altogether, these results demonstrate that cerebral DHODH inhibition conveys potent antiepileptic protection even in the severe, pharmacoresistant genetic model of epilepsy."

                "The present work supports our recent hypothesis suggesting that mitochondrial signaling is a core member of homeostatic machinery underlying firing homeostasis (Frere and Slutsky, 2018). These results are important for several reasons. First, they uncover previously unrecognized mechanisms regulating excitatory synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and spontaneous firing by basal DHODH activity. Second, they provide a proof of principle of the mitochondrial role in the regulation of activity set points. Third, they reveal that activity set points and homeostatic compensatory mechanisms are separately regulated in neuronal networks. Fourth, they reveal a new potential strategy to suppress seizures. Fifth, they demonstrate the power of genome-wide computational approaches to predict homeostatic regulators in specific neural circuits."

                        "Set points in physiology have been a puzzle for decades, leaving many central questions unanswered: Do set points exist? Is the set point fixed or variable? What are the mechanisms underlying a set-point establishment? In this study, we developed an experimental framework to identify the core regulators of MFR set points versus compensatory effector mechanisms in neural circuits. Our results show that DHODH met the criteria of bona fide regulator of set-point establishment: (1) the perturbation causes a stable change in the controlled variable without inducing a compensatory response, and (2) known, bi-directional activity perturbations that induce firing renormalization under control conditions still activate compensatory mechanisms but toward the new set-point value (Styr and Slutsky, 2018). On the basis of our data, we conclude that firing set points are tunable in hippocampal networks. Thus, in addition to many physiological variables related to energy metabolism, such as adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose and lipid homeostasis, firing rate homeostasis is characterized by adjustable set points. In comparison with fixed set points, adjustable set points have been assumed to provide a greater degree of adaptability but are more vulnerable to dysregulation, yielding chronic diseases (Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015).",
                        "Another important conclusion based on our results relates to the differential regulation of homeostatic feedback responses and firing rate set points. Although several candidates have been proposed to be required for specific adaptive mechanisms, the master regulator orchestrating multiple homeostatic responses remains to be uncovered. It is worth mentioning that general reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential impairs homeostatic responses to activity perturbations, suggesting that DHODH regulates activity set points via specific mitochondrial signaling pathways. Whether a lower MFR set point imposed by DHODH inhibition is caused by a modulation of a putative Ca2+ sensor or by readjusting the expression of homeostatic effectors remains to be elucidated. Future studies are needed to identify the cellular program underlying activity set-point regulation by mitochondrial DHODH in central mammalian circuits."

                        "How does DHODH activity regulate mitochondrial functions in hippocampal neurons? Mitochondria play a critical role in energy metabolism and Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons (Devine and Kittler, 2018). Both Ca2+ buffering and ATP production have been shown to profoundly affect presynaptic function (Gazit et\u00a0al., 2016, Kwon et\u00a0al., 2016, Rangaraju et\u00a0al., 2014, Vaccaro et\u00a0al., 2016, Verstreken et\u00a0al., 2005). Although DHODH inhibition does not alter ATP levels, it diminishes spare respiratory capacity of mitochondria in hippocampal neurons. Given the dependency of spare and maximal respiratory capacity on cyto- and mito-Ca2+ (Llorente-Folch et\u00a0al., 2013, Luongo et\u00a0al., 2015), these metabolic changes may be caused by DHODH-mediated modifications in Ca2+ homeostasis. Namely, TERI profoundly and rapidly decreases resting mito-Ca2+, while enhancing Ca2+ buffering during spiking activity. Thus, DHODH links metabolic, Ca2+, and firing homeostasis.",
                        "How do hippocampal neurons respond to DHODH-mediated changes in mitochondrial functions? The most intuitive explanation of the observed stable inhibition of spiking network activity would be that neuronal activity is limited by diminished spare respiratory capacity. However, the hippocampal network can fire at 8-fold higher rates under DHODH inhibition. Thus, instead of limiting MFR, decreased spare respiratory capacity constitutes the regulatory MFR mechanisms. Although previous studies linked decreased spare respiratory capacity to pathological conditions (Nicholls, 2008), lowering the MFR set point may present an adaptive strategy of neurons in response to diminished spare respiratory capacity. Such an adaptive decrease in spiking activity and a subsequent reduction in energy usage may serve to maintain metabolic homeostasis and long-term tissue viability in hippocampal circuits. It is worth noting that short-term synaptic facilitation was even enhanced following chronic DHODH inhibition in\u00a0vivo. Thus, limiting the spare respiratory capacity of mitochondria results in lowering the MFR set point, without sacrificing input-specific information processing and homeostatic plasticity to persistent activity changes."

                        "Neuronal activity, being heavily dependent on glucose supply as the main fuel source (Magistretti and Allaman, 2015), is especially vulnerable to metabolic dysregulation. Thus, pathological brain states characterized by aberrant firing are likely to be associated with a dysregulated metabolic network. Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunctions have been linked to initiation and progression of distinct types of epilepsy (Zsurka and Kunz, 2015), a brain disorder characterized by firing instability and recurrent seizures, reflecting aberrant synchronous activity of large groups of neurons.",
                        "Our results highlight the potential of cerebral DHODH as a therapeutic target for epilepsy. Previous studies extensively explored DHODH as a potential drug target across autoimmune diseases, oncology, and infectious diseases. TERI is approved for multiple sclerosis treatment and presumably acts by antagonizing the proliferation of lymphocytes via de novo pyrimidine synthesis (Bar-Or, 2014). However, our results demonstrate that in terminally differentiated neurons, TERI attenuates spontaneous spiking activity via regulation of mitochondrial functions. Our results suggest that TERI is likely to suppress hyperexcitability by mitigating mito-Ca2+ overload. This mechanism of action is different from the known metabolic antiepileptic strategies such as a ketogenic diet (Peterman, 1925) and stiripentol (Sada et\u00a0al., 2015) that are thought to primarily act on the availability of energy fuel. Given that cortical hyperactivity is associated with the remission phase of multiple sclerosis in a mouse model (Ellwardt et\u00a0al., 2018), reduction of firing set point by cerebral DHODH inhibition may provide a new way to slow down neurodegeneration.",
                        "At least 25%\u201340% of epilepsy patients are resistant to drug therapy and do not receive adequate seizure control (Schmidt and Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4, 2012). DS is among the most drug-resistant forms of epilepsy (Dravet, 2011). Drugs currently used as first-line therapy for Dravet patients, such as valproate and clobazam, have limited efficacy, and other antiepileptic drugs, including lamotrigine, vigabatrin, and oxcarbazepine, even exacerbate seizures in Dravet patients (Ziobro et\u00a0al., 2018). Alternative new therapies are urgently needed for this highly refractory epilepsy syndrome. In this study, we demonstrated beneficial effects of TERI in a mouse model of DS, including markedly reduced occurrence of interictal spikes and an increase of 1.5\u00b0C in the susceptibility to thermally induced seizures (Figure\u00a08E). Of note, a difference of 1.2\u00b0C was observed between DS mice on the C57BL/6 genetic background, which exhibit more than 60% premature mortality, and DS mice on the pure 129/SvJ genetic background, which have mild epilepsy and about 90% survival (Rubinstein et\u00a0al., 2015, Yu et\u00a0al., 2006).",
                        "In light of our findings, the therapeutic potential of cerebral DHODH inhibition deserves to be further explored with regard to intractable epilepsy. On the basis of our data, we conclude that mild mitochondrial inhibition can be used for therapeutic purposes only if homeostatic feedback responses to ongoing perturbations and information processing remain uncompromised. Our work provides the foundation for future studies on the mechanisms by which mitochondria adjust activity set points and on the role of dysregulated set points in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and perhaps other disorders associated with aberrant network activity."

                                "(1)Based on CBM constraints arising from the human metabolic model and information derived from gene-expression data, the iMAT algorithm generates a feasible solution space of metabolic reactions activity that best coincides with the input expression data, thus simulating the post-transcriptional metabolic flux distribution in a given state. A first pre-requisite for using iMAT (Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool) (Zur et\u00a0al., 2010) is mapping the gene expression data into the human metabolic model. Genes were mapped according to their gene symbol to the model and later on discretized to highly, lowly or moderately expressed for each sample. This discretization was based on the ranking of the expression so that the top 25% were designated highly expressed while the bottom 25% as lowly expressed, the rest were designated moderately expressed. As each iMAT analysis requires a single vector of expression in each sample, only genes that were consistently highly or lowly expressed in 2/3 of its samples were defined so in the final input of the iMAT algorithm.(2)Given these expression-derived constraints, the iMAT analysis computes the feasible flux space across the network using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach designed to find a steady-state flux distribution satisfying stoichiometric and thermodynamic constraints, while maximizing the number of reactions whose activity is consistent with their expression (Shlomi et\u00a0al., 2008). In order to find an optimized solution for the MILP problems presented we used the IBM CPLEX linear optimization tool. A total of 2000 solutions were sampled for each sample using Artificially Centered hit\u2013and\u2013run (ACHR) sampling supplied by Cobra toolbox 2.0 (Schellenberger et\u00a0al., 2011) according to the solution space derived from iMAT. The mean value of each reaction flux across these solutions is then used to depict a sample\u2019s metabolic state.(3)This flux distribution output was then used as input for the MTA algorithm (Yizhak et\u00a0al., 2013), which was utilized to search for drug targets that are likely to transform a metabolically compromised seizure-associated condition toward a healthy or neuroprotective protective one. MTA gets as input gene expression levels of two metabolic states, termed source and targets states. Next, the MTA approach works to (a) infer the most likely distribution of fluxes in the source state using iMAT; (b) identify the set of genes that their expression has significantly changed between the source and targets states, and the set of genes that their expression remains constant. Following, the algorithm searches for perturbations that can globally shift all the fluxes of the changed reactions in the desired direction, while keeping the fluxes of the unchanged reaction as close as possible to their predicted source state. Finally, MTA outputs a ranked list of candidate perturbations according to their ability to induce the desired transformation, from the source to the target metabolic state (Yizhak et\u00a0al., 2013). In the MTA analysis, all dead-end reactions as well as artificial ones (reaction not mapped to genes) were filtered out leaving a total of 1504 reactions. The list of most likely metabolic perturbations was selected using a dual criterion: (1) The reactions should have a score higher than what would have been achieved without any perturbation; (2) In the top 10% scores in each prediction (150 reactions).(4)MTA overall predictions were initially validated on a large scale by compiling a Seizure Predisposing Gene List: The list of seizure predisposing genes was derived using the MGI Phenotype disease and alleles query (Search Category: Seizure; MP: 0002064). First, a total of 327 genes were associated with knockout or overexpression experiments leading to increased\u00a0seizure activity. Second, 38 Knockout metabolic genes were filtered in order to validate Epileptic MTA prediction sets. To define if these reactions were significantly enriched in MTA predictions we used a hypergeometric statistical test (see Table S2)."

Briefly, the mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine/xylazine (80mg/kg ketamine and 15mg/kg xylazine), head fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf instruments) and maintained anesthetized by continuous isoflurane (1.5%) inhalation. Eye ointment was used to protect the mice eyes (Duratears, Vetmarket) and deep body temperature was recorded and maintained by a heating pad (FHC, DC temperature controller) at 36\u00b0C throughout the surgery. A small hole was drilled in the skull above the left lateral ventricle (0.7mm posterior, 1.2mm lateral to bregma), and a 5mm guide cannula was slowly inserted into the ventricle and fixed to the skull by dental cement (C&B Metabond, Parkell). The guide cannula was sealed with a 5mm sterile metal bar to prevent CSF leakage and possible infections. 1-2\u00a0weeks after the surgery, the mice received i.c.v. injections using a 10\u00a0\u03bcl syringe (Hamilton company) once a day, for three consecutive days. The mice were injected with 1\u00a0\u03bcl containing 27\u00a0\u03bcg of Teriflunomide (TERI), dissolved in DMSO or vehicle (VEH, 1\u00a0\u03bcl of DMSO) in speed of 0.15\u00a0\u03bcl/min (Nano Jet stereotaxic syringe pump). In order to confirm the accurate placement of the guide cannula into the lateral ventricle, at least 5 mice from each group (TERI / VEH) were submitted to dye injection (Trypan blue dye solution) in the end of experiments."

The microdrive contained a moveable assembly of 4 tetrodes (17-\u03bcm, Platinum 10% Iridium, California Fine Wire) and was connected to the recording setup via an Omnetics headstage connector (Connector Corporation, Minneapolis MN, USA). Three holes were drilled in the skull: one in the frontal bone plate for a screw serving as ground; the second hole for the electrodes implanted in the parietal cortex (1.94\u00a0mm posterior of bregma; 1-1.2\u00a0mm medial lateral axis; 1-1.2\u00a0mm dorsal ventral axis), and the third hole - for the cannula implanted in the lateral ventricle ipsilateral to the recording site (0.46\u00a0mm posterior of bregma;1\u00a0mm ML; 2\u00a0mm DV). The cannula was sealed with a 5mm sterile metal bar to prevent CSF leakage and\u00a0possible infections.

Raw data were sampled at 24 KHz using a Neurophysiology Workstation (RZ5D base processor and PZ5 NeuroDigitizer amplifier, Tucker-Davis Technologies Inc).
