- test effect of uridine on MFR reduction

### Example 4. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Reduction in Intrinsic Excitability

- examine effect of DHODH inhibition on intrinsic excitability

### Example 5. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in the Inhibition-Excitation Ratio

- assess effect of DHODH inhibition on I/E ratio

### Example 6. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Decrease in Excitatory Quantal Amplitude

- test effect of DHODH inhibition on excitatory quantal events

### Example 7. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in Excitability of Fast-Spiking PV Interneurons

- examine effect of DHODH inhibition on PV cells

### Example 8. DHODH Inhibition does not Impair Neuronal Homeostatic System

- test effect of DHODH inhibition on homeostatic compensation

### Example 9. DHODH Inhibition Reduces Behavioral Seizure Duration in Pilocarpine Model for TLE

- test therapeutic benefit of DHODH inhibition
- examine effect of teriflunomide on seizure duration
