## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1. DHODH is a Potential Metabolic Target for Epilepsy and MCI

### Example 2. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Stable Reduction of Mean Firing Rates in Hippocampal Networks

### Example 3. DHODH-Mediated Inhibition of Firing Rates is not Dependent on De Novo Pyrimidine Synthesis

### Example 4. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Reduction in Intrinsic Excitability

### Example 5. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in the Inhibition-Excitation Ratio

### Example 6. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Decrease in Excitatory Quantal Amplitude

### Example 7. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in Excitability of Fast-Spiking PV Interneurons

### Example 8. DHODH Inhibition does not Impair Neuronal Homeostatic System

### Example 9. DHODH Inhibition Reduces Behavioral Seizure Duration in Pilocarpine Model for TLE
