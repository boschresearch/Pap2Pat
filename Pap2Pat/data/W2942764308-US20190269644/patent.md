# DESCRIPTION

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to methods and pharmaceutical compositions for preventing, delaying onset of, or treating diseases or disorders associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity, more particularly, for treating epilepsy or preventing sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.

## BACKGROUND ART

Emerging evidence suggests that hyperactivity of hippocampal and medial temporal lobe network is common in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (Pitkanen and Sutula, 2002), mild-cognitive impairments (MCI) (Bakker et al., 2012; Dickerson et al., 2005; Yassa et al., 2010), in mildly impaired, amyloid positive older adults (Sperling et al., 2009) and young APOE-ε4 carriers at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Kunz et al., 2015). Further, a longitudinal fMRI study revealed that hippocampal hyperactivation in MCI predicted a greater degree of subsequent cognitive decline (Miller et al., 2008). Hippocampal hyperactivity is evident in numerous epilepsy animal models (Grone and Baraban, 2015; Krook-Magnuson and Soltesz, 2015; Paz and Huguenard, 2015), AD mouse models (Busche et al., 2008; Minkeviciene et al., 2009; Palop et al., 2007; Palop and Mucke, 2009; Verret et al., 2012) and cognitively-impaired aged rats (Koh et al., 2010). Notably, a low-dose of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam reduces metabolic hyperactivity in the hippocampus and mediates the improvement of memory in MCI patients (Bakker et al., 2012). Similarly, leviteracetam reduces brain hyperactivity and improves cognitive impairments in AD mouse models (Sanchez et al., 2012). However, all the other anti-epileptic drugs show no efficiency in attenuation of AD-related brain hyperactivity (Sanchez et al., 2012).

Despite the development of various antiepileptic drugs over the past 20 years, the efficacy of drug treatments for epilepsy has not substantially improved, and 25-40% of the patients suffer from drug-resistant seizures (Wilcox et al., 2013). New antiepileptic strategies are thus urgently needed to improve the quality of life and prevent premature deaths of patients with epilepsy. For AD patients, the impact of the currently approved FDA drugs on the disease manifestations is modest and even negligible. Over 300 different pharmacological compounds, most of which are designed to reduce Aβ levels and its aggregation, are at various stages of development; however, until now clinical trials focused on anti-Aβ therapies fail to show improvements of cognitive function. Thus, new therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing excitability, decreasing excitation-inhibition ratio and increasing stability of firing patterns, may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of epilepsy, MCI and early AD stages.

A recent study suggests that gene expression patterns in MCI are neither an extension of aging nor an intermediate between aging and AD, but represent a unique molecular state undergoing a nonlinear progression in the transitions from cognitively intact aging to MCI and AD (Berchtold et al., 2014). The MCI brain undergoes vast molecular reprogramming, resulting in upregulation of metabolic genes related to mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial electron transport chain (mECT) reaction, protein homeostasis and synaptic function (Berchtold et al., 2014). Gene expression changes that potentiate neuronal excitability and synaptic activity in limbic brain regions were strongly associated with impaired cognitive function. Moreover, robust changes in metabolism have been observed in epilepsy, even at the very early stages of the disease: diminished utilization of glucose (Henry et al., 1990) and shifts in glutamate metabolism were connected to the progression of the disease (Eid et al., 2004; Petroff et al., 2002). The ketogenic diet was found to be highly effective in treating epilepsy, emphasizing the importance of modifications in the metabolic network in rescuing or diminishing seizure activity (Bough et al., 2006; Lutas and Yellen, 2013). Perturbations in metabolism such as inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (Sada et al., 2015) and inhibition of glycolysis (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006) have been shown to reduce seizure activity.

## SUMMARY OF INVENTION

It has now been found, in accordance with the present invention, that the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme is a critical regulator of neuronal excitability and inhibition-excitation balance in hippocampal circuits, and inhibition of this enzyme, either by a small molecule, e.g. an inhibitor such as (2Z)-2-cyano-3-hydroxy-N-[4-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]but-2-enamide (teriflunomide; Teri; Aubagio®), or a small interfering RNA (siRNA)- or small/short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-knockdown, may represent a new strategy to reduce/attenuate cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity, to thereby prevent, delay onset of, or treat neurodegenerative diseases and disorders associated with elevated cortico-hippocampal activity such as epilepsy, and prevent or delay MCI-to-AD progression.

The protein encoded by the DHODH gene, a mitochondrial protein located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the fourth enzymatic step, i.e., the ubiquinone-mediated oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate, in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, as further been found, addition of uridine (a precursor of pyrimidines) does not occlude the reduction in maximum firing rate (MFR) induced by teriflunomide at a timescale of 2 days, indicating that lack of uridine is not the factor leading to long-term reduction in the MFR, and suggesting that DHODH inhibition triggers a long-term reduction in firing rates due to its direct inhibition of mitochondrial functions, but not de-novo pyrimidine synthesis.

In one aspect, the present invention thus relates to a method for preventing, delaying onset of, or treating a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity in a subject, e.g., a mammal such as a human, in need thereof, said method comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the central nervous system (CNS) of said subject, optionally together with a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, provided that when said active agent is administered without said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, said subject does not suffer from multiple sclerosis. The active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS may be, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule capable of reducing the gene expression level of DHODH enzyme, or a small molecule capable of reducing the activity of DHODH enzyme in the CNS.

In another aspect, the present invention relates to an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS for use, optionally in combination with a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, in preventing, delaying onset of, or treating a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity.

It yet another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for preventing, delaying onset of, or treating a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity, said composition comprising an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, and optionally a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof.

In still another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, and a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof.

In a further aspect, the present invention provides a kit comprising: (i) a first pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS; (ii) a second pharmaceutical composition comprising a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof; and optionally (iii) instructions for co-administration of said pharmaceutical compositions for preventing, delaying onset of, or treating a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the DHODH inhibitor may be formed by conventional means, e.g., by reacting a free base form of the DHODH inhibitor with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is removed in vacuo or by freeze drying, or by exchanging the anion/cation of an existing salt for another anion/cation on a suitable ion exchange resin.

According to the method disclosed herein, the active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS is administered either alone or together with a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof.

The term “pyrimidine nucleobase” as used herein refers to any of the three types of nucleobases that are pyrimidine derivatives, i.e., uracil (pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione; 2-oxy-4-oxy pyrimidine), cytosine (4-aminopyrimidin-2(1H)-one; 4-amino-1H-pyrimidine-2-one), and thymine (5-methylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione; 5-methyluracil).

The terms “de-novo pyrimidine synthesis” and “de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis”, used herein interchangeably, refer to the “orotate pathway”, which is defined as the formation of uridine monophosphate (UMP) from carbamoyl phosphate (CP). The initial reaction in the orotate pathway catalyzed by CP synthetase is the formation of CP by combination of carbonate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and an amino group from glutamine Three additional reactions are necessary to form the pyrimidine ring from CP. The phosphoribosyl group of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is added to the pyrimidine base, orotate, forming orotidine 5′-monophosphate that is then decarboxylated to make UMP, the first pyrimidine nucleotide. UMP is subsequently phosphorylated to uridine diphosphate (UDP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP). The transfer of an amino group from glutamine to UTP by cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthetase leads to the synthesis of CTP. UMP is also a precursor for the synthesis of cytidine monophosphate (CMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).

In certain embodiments, the intermediate in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleobases is uridine, UMP, cytidine, CMP, deoxythymidine, or dTMP. In particular such embodiments, said intermediate is uridine or UMP.

In certain embodiments, the method of the present invention comprises administering to said subject a combination of agents, i.e., (i) a therapeutically effective amount of said active agent being capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, e.g., a DHODH inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with (ii) said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, wherein each one of said agents is as defined in any one of the embodiments above. In particular such embodiments, said method comprises administering therapeutically effective amounts of leflunomide or teriflunomide, preferably teriflunomide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with uridine, UMP, cytidine, CMP, deoxythymidine, or dTMP, preferably UMP. According to the method of the invention, these two agents can be administered via the same or different administration routes, as well as concomitantly or subsequently at any order. In a particular embodiment, the two agents are administered from a sole pharmaceutical composition.

In other embodiments, the method of the present invention comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of solely said active agent being capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS (i.e., without said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof), as defined in any one of the embodiments above, e.g., a DHODH inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein said subject does not suffer from multiple sclerosis. In particular such embodiments, the active agent administered is leflunomide or teriflunomide, preferably teriflunomide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

In certain embodiments, the method of the invention, as defined in any one of the embodiments above, is utilized for treating or delaying onset of a neurodegenerative disease or disorder associated with elevated cortico-hippocampal activity. Examples of such neurodegenerative disease or disorder include, without limiting, epilepsy such as TLE or Dravet syndrome, also known as Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI); mild-cognitive impairments (MCI); or Alzheimer's disease, both sporadic and genetic. In particular such embodiments, the neurodegenerative disease or disorder treated according to said method is epilepsy, and said method is in fact aimed at preventing sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) of the subject treated.

In other embodiments, the subject treated by the method of the invention is at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, e.g., a subject carrying apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4, and said method, as defined in any one of the embodiments above, is aimed at preventing or delaying onset of Alzheimer's disease in said subject.

The term “subject” as used herein refers to a mammal that is either a human (herein also referred to as “individual”) or a non-human animal.

The term “treating” as used herein with respect to a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity means administering an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, e.g., teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, optionally together with a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, e.g., uridine or UMP, after the onset of at least one pathological phenotype manifested by said disease or disorder in order to treat, reduce or attenuate said pathological phenotype, and/or slow down the progression of said disease or disorder, i.e., prevent the appearance, or delay the onset, of other pathological phenotypes associated with said disease or disorder. The terms “preventing” and “delaying the onset” as used herein with respect to said disease or disorder mean administering said active agent, optionally together with said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, to a subject either diagnosed as suffering from an elevated cortico-hippocampal activity or being at genetic risk for developing a disease or disorder associated with elevated cortico-hippocampal activity, prior to the onset of at least one pathological phenotype manifested by said disease or disorder, in order to prevent the appearance, or delay the onset, of said disease or disorder.

The term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein refers to the amount or dose of an active agent as defined above, e.g., teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, that is useful to treat, attenuate, prevent, or delay the onset of at least one pathological phenotype manifested by a disease or disorder associated with elevated cortico-hippocampal activity.

In other words, in case said active agent is administered together with said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, both agents may be delivered by the same administration route, from either a sole pharmaceutical composition or two different pharmaceutical compositions, or by different administration routes.

In certain embodiments, the method of the present invention is aimed at treating a neurodegenerative disease or disorder such as epilepsy (e.g., TLE or Dravet syndrome), MCI or AD, and comprises intrathecal administration of an active agent, as defined in any one of the embodiments above, wherein a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof is optionally administered together with said active agent, by any suitable administration route, but preferably by intrathecal administration as well. In particular such embodiments, the active agent is teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof that is delivered intrathecally, optionally together with a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof.

Examples of pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediates in the de novo synthesis thereof include, e.g., uridine, UMP, cytidine, CMP, deoxythymidine, and dTMP.

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be prepared by conventional techniques, e.g., as described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th Ed., 1995. The compositions can be prepared, e.g., by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient(s), i.e., said active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, said pyrimidine nucleobase or intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof, or both, into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. The compositions may be in liquid, solid or semisolid form and may further include pharmaceutically acceptable fillers, carriers, diluents or adjuvants, and other inert ingredients and excipients. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is formulated as nanoparticles.

The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be formulated for any suitable route of administration, e.g., for parenteral administration such as intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrapleural, intratracheal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, topical administration, oral or enteral administration, or for inhalation, and can be provided in a variety of dosages. Particular such compositions are formulated for intrathecal, intraperitoneal or intravenous administration, or for subcutaneous administration e.g. by an alzet pump implanted subcutaneously, but preferably for intrathecal administration. The dosage will depend on the state of the subject treated, and will be determined as deemed appropriate by the practitioner.

The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension, which may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing, wetting or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include, without limiting, water, Ringer's solution, PEG, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), Tween-80, and isotonic sodium chloride solution.

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, when formulated for administration route other than parenteral administration, may be in a form suitable for oral use, e.g., as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous, or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.

Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral administration may be formulated for immediate release, or alternatively to inhibit the release of the active agent in the stomach, i.e., delay the release of the active agent until at least a portion of the dosage form has traversed the stomach, e.g., to avoid the acidity of the gastric contents from hydrolyzing the active agent. Particular such compositions are those wherein the active agent is coated by a pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer. Examples of pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer include, without being limited to, Eudragit® S (poly(methacrylicacid, methylmethacrylate), 1:2), Eudragit® L 55 (poly (methacrylicacid, ethylacrylate), 1:1), Kollicoat® (poly(methacrylicacid, ethylacrylate), 1:1), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), alginates, carboxymethylcellulose, and combinations thereof. The pH-dependent enteric-coating polymer may be present in the composition in an amount from about 10% to about 95% by weight of the entire composition.

Pharmaceutical compositions intended for oral administration may be prepared according to any method known in the art, and may further comprise one or more agents selected from sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, e.g., inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate, or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, e.g., corn starch or alginic acid; binding agents, e.g., starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc. The tablets may be either uncoated or coated utilizing known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated using the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108, 4,166,452 and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsion.

Oral pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for immediate release, as well as for controlled release, i.e., extended-, sustained-, or delayed-release, of the active agent. Such compositions may be formulated as controlled-release matrix, e.g., as controlled-release matrix tablets in which the release of a soluble active agent is controlled by having the active diffuse through a gel formed after the swelling of a hydrophilic polymer brought into contact with dissolving liquid (in vitro) or gastro-intestinal fluid (in vivo). Many polymers have been described as capable of forming such gel, e.g., derivatives of cellulose, in particular the cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose or methyl hydroxypropyl cellulose, and among the different commercial grades of these ethers are those showing fairly high viscosity. In other configurations, the compositions comprise the active agent formulated for controlled release in microencapsulated dosage form, in which small droplets of the active agent are surrounded by a coating or a membrane to form particles in the range of a few micrometers to a few millimeters.

Another contemplated formulation is depot systems, based on biodegradable polymers, wherein as the polymer degrades, the active ingredient is slowly released. The most common class of biodegradable polymers is the hydrolytically labile polyesters prepared from lactic acid, glycolic acid, or combinations of these two molecules. Polymers prepared from these individual monomers include poly (D,L-lactide) (PLA), poly (glycolide) (PGA), and the copolymer poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG).

Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, when formulated for inhalation, may be administered utilizing any suitable device known in the art, such as metered dose inhalers, liquid nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, sprayers, thermal vaporizers, electrohydrodynamic aerosolizers, and the like.

In a further aspect, the present invention provides a kit comprising: (i) a first pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS as defined in any one of the embodiments above; (ii) a second pharmaceutical composition comprising a pyrimidine nucleobase or an intermediate in the de novo synthesis thereof as defined in any one of the embodiments above; and optionally (iii) instructions for co-administration of said pharmaceutical compositions for preventing, delaying onset of, or treating a disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity. Examples of disease or disorder associated with cortico-hippocampal hyperactivity include, without limiting, neurodegenerative diseases or disorders such as epilepsy, e.g., TLE, or Dravet syndrome; MCI; or Alzheimer's disease.

The active agent comprised within the first composition of the kit may be any agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, e.g., an active agent comprising a nucleic acid molecule that reduces the gene expression level of DHODH enzyme; or a small molecule capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, such as leflunomide, teriflunomide, brequinar, DD264, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, e.g., teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of pyrimidine nucleobases or intermediates in the de novo synthesis thereof, which may be comprised within the second composition, include uridine, UMP, cytidine, CMP, deoxythymidine, and dTMP. According to the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions comprised within the kit disclosed herein may be formulated for the same or different administration route, and may be administered concomitantly or subsequently at any order. In particular embodiments, the first pharmaceutical composition and optionally the second pharmaceutical composition is(are) formulated for intrathecal administration.

Based on the experimental data shown herein, it is postulated that intrathecal administration of an active agent as referred to herein in general, and of teriflunomide in particular, is expected to be substantially more efficient in treating multiple sclerosis compared to other administration modes such as intravenously or intraperitoneally.

In yet a further aspect, the present invention thus relates to a method for treatment of multiple sclerosis in a subject in need thereof, said method comprising intrathecally administrating to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS of said subject, as defined in any one of the embodiments above, e.g., teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

In still a further aspect, the present invention relates to an active agent capable of reducing DHODH enzyme activity in the CNS, as defined in any one of the embodiments above, e.g., teriflunomide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in treatment of multiple sclerosis, wherein said active agent is formulated for intrathecal administration.

The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1. DHODH is a Potential Metabolic Target for Epilepsy and MCI

To search for novel, disease-transformative common targets for epilepsy, MCI and prodromal AD, a system-based approach for attenuation of hippocampal hyperactivity, more specifically the metabolic transformation algorithm (MTA) recently developed by the Ruppin lab (Yizhak et al., 2013), was used. The MTA is a generic genome scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) analysis approach for predicting genetic perturbations that are most likely to transform a given source metabolic state to a desired target one, which has been successfully applied to predict and experimentally validate two novel life-extending metabolic genes (Yizhak et al., 2013).

Applying the MTA to the analysis of human MCI and epilepsy pilocarpine rat model gene expression data, we conducted an in silico knockout screen of all human metabolic genes and ranked them according to their ability to transform a diseased metabolic state back to the corresponding healthy state. This analysis revealed the DHODH mitochondrial enzyme as the most significantly predicted common epilepsy and MCI target that may transform diseased metabolic state into a normal healthy state. DHODH is the fourth enzyme in the pyrimidine-de-novo synthesis, catalyzing the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate and inhibiting the mETC irrespective of de-novo pyrimidine synthesis (Fang et al., 2013). Interestingly, both the DHODH inhibitor leflunomide and its active metabolite teriflunomide are used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Compston and Coles, 2008). It is assumed that DHODH inhibition targets rapidly proliferating cells such as T- and B-lymphocytes that rely on pyrimidine-de-novo synthesis and thus helps regulating the inflammatory response, but the exact mechanisms by which DHODH inhibition benefits multiple sclerosis patients is unclear (Bar-Or, 2014). Yet, whether DHODH inhibition directly regulates neuronal activity remains unknown.

### Example 2. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Stable Reduction of Mean Firing Rates in Hippocampal Networks

In order to test how DHODH targeting affects neuronal activity, we examined the effect of the DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide on cultured hippocampal neurons grown on a multi-electrode chip (MEA) that allows a long-term monitoring of spiking activity from many neurons simultaneously (FIGS. 1A-1C). As found, addition of 50 μM teriflunomide resulted in fast and stark decrease in neuronal mean firing rate (MFR, FIGS. 1D-1F, 1H), which was reduced from 3.95±0.27 Hz during baseline to 1.58±0.17 Hz after 4 h of teriflunomide application. Interestingly, the lower MFR induced by teriflunomide was stable for 14 hr following teriflunomide application (FIGS. 1G-1H), indicating that neuronal homeostatic mechanisms are unable to compensate DHODH-induced inhibition of firing frequency and that changes induced by teriflunomide application are stable.

In order to test the specificity of teriflunomide effect on firing rate, we used a lentiviral-based shRNA delivery system (shDHODH; TRCN0000294665, Sigma Aldrich) to knockdown DHODH expression in hippocampal cultures. As found, reduction in DHODH mRNA level by ˜80% resulted in a lower basal MFR (1.78±0.17 Hz, FIGS. 1G-1H); however, application of teriflunomide in shDHODH-infected cultures did not produce long-term changes in MFR (FIG. 1G). These results indicate that teriflunomide specifically inhibits DHODH to induce a stable reduction in the MFR in hippocampal neurons, and therefore support its potential anti-epileptic function.

### Example 3. DHODH-Mediated Inhibition of Firing Rates is not Dependent on De Novo Pyrimidine Synthesis

In order to test whether the change in MFR resulting from DHODH inhibition is induced by the reduction of available uridine (a precursor of pyrimidines) or results from a change in the mitochondrial function, we co-applied 100 μM uridine mono-phosphate with teriflunomide in MEA recordings. As found, addition of uridine did not occlude the reduction in MFR induced by teriflunomide at a timescale of 2 days (FIG. 2), indicating that lack of uridine is not the factor that leads to long-term reduction in the MFR; and suggesting that DHODH inhibition triggers a long-term reduction in the MFR due to its direct inhibition of mitochondrial functions rather than de-novo pyrimidine synthesis.

### Example 4. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Reduction in Intrinsic Excitability

Modulation of intrinsic excitability is an important facet of neuronal adaptation. In this experiment we elicited action potentials (APs) in response to increasing somatic current injections ranging from 0 to +500 pA (F-I curves) in the presence of postsynaptic receptor blockers (FIGS. 3A-3B). As found, teriflunomide induced a reduction in the maximal firing frequency from 31.4±2.29 Hz to 17.2±3.34 after 4 hr of incubation, and to 16.25±3.06 Hz after 2 days of incubation (FIGS. 3B-3C). Input resistance was not affected by teriflunomide application (FIGS. 3D-3E). These results indicate that DHODH inhibition reduces intrinsic neuronal excitability, and that this change is resistant to homeostatic adaptations and remains stable for 2 days.

### Example 5. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in the Inhibition-Excitation Ratio

The inhibition-excitation (I/E) ratio constitutes an important factor in firing rate homeostasis, and in pathology of epilepsy. To assess the effects of DHODH inhibition on the I/E ratio, the spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs, sIPSCs, respectively) were isolated at the same cell based on the reversal potentials of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory and GABAAR-mediated inhibitory currents, and the integrated excitatory (FIG. 4A) and inhibitory conductance's (GE, GI, respectively) were calculated (FIGS. 4B-4D).

The results show a dramatic decrease in average GE after 4 hr of teriflunomide incubation, which was stable during 2 days of incubation (FIG. 4B) and resulted in a significant and stable increase in I/E ratio (FIG. 4D). This decrease was selective to the excitatory synaptic drive, as GI showed no significant reduction after either 4 hr or 2 days of incubation (FIG. 4C). These results indicate that the reduction in the MFR induced by teriflunomide is correlated with a change in the network balance between excitation and inhibition, and that DHODH inhibition and downstream mitochondrial signaling may have a differential effect on excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

### Example 6. DHODH Inhibition Induces a Decrease in Excitatory Quantal Amplitude

In this experiment we tested whether DHODH inhibition affects excitatory quantal events, by recording mEPSCs from hippocampal neurons under control conditions and 2 days following teriflunomide application (FIG. 5). As found, chronic teriflunomide incubation triggered a significant decrease of ˜26% in mEPSC amplitude (FIGS. 5A-5B). In addition, a tendency towards reduction in mEPSC frequency was observed, but did not reach statistical significance (FIGS. 5C-5D, p=0.08). These data suggest that chronic DHODH inhibition triggers robust inhibition of quantal excitatory synaptic transmission, likely due to reduction in the number/conductance of the postsynaptic AMPARs.

### Example 7. DHODH Inhibition Induces an Increase in Excitability of Fast-Spiking PV Interneurons

The fast spiking phenotype of parvalbumin-expressing neurons (PV cells) exerts high metabolic demands, and PV cells express high density of mitochondria to support this function (Gulyaz et al., 2006). These facts make PV cells extremely sensitive to metabolic stress (Whittaker et al., 2011). In order to test whether the increase in the I/E ratio results from the differential teriflunomide effect on excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we decided to measure intrinsic excitability in fast-spiking PV cells. To specifically examine PV cell properties, we used cultures from mice that express Cre-recombinase under a PV promotor, and infected them with a double-floxed AAV virus to produce targeted expression of the fluorescent tag m-Cherry (FIG. 6). PV cells were identified by their non-accommodating fast-spiking phenotype.

As surprisingly found, teriflunomide triggered an increase in maximal firing rate of PV cells from 83.50±11.04 to 110.9±7.22 after 2 days of teriflunomide incubation, indicating that the metabolic regulation of inhibitory PV cells differs from that of excitatory cells, and that this differential regulation most probably contributes to the increase in the I/E ratio and the reduction in MFR.

### Example 8. DHODH Inhibition does not Impair Neuronal Homeostatic System

The stable reduction in MFR induced by teriflunomide could have been the result of either impairment of homeostatic compensation mechanisms, or a change in a firing set-point value. A perturbation of firing rate in vivo results in re-normalization to its set-point level 2 days following perturbation through homeostatic mechanisms (Hengen et al., 2013). Similarly, application of baclofen results in a profound inhibition of firing rate that returns to it baseline level after 2 days (Slomowitz et al., 2015). In order to determine the role DHODH inhibition in homeostatic process, we added 10 μM baclofen following 12 hr incubation with teriflunomide (FIG. 7).

As found, addition of baclofen in the presence of teriflunomide reduced MFR acutely from a new lower baseline value of 2.50±0.38 Hz to 0.3678±0.08 Hz. This reduction was gradually corrected over a 2-day period; however, the culture did not reach the original baseline value of 4.30±0.0.44 Hz. Instead, the MFR stabilized around a lower value of 2.00±0.35 Hz, closer to the one induced by teriflunomide incubation. These results suggest that homeostatic compensation mechanisms are still active under DHODH inhibition, yet are tuned to drive the steady-state of the network to a lower set-point level.

### Example 9. DHODH Inhibition Reduces Behavioral Seizure Duration in Pilocarpine Model for TLE

In order to determine the potential therapeutic benefit of DHODH inhibition for epilepsy treatment, we used the pilocarpine model of TLE, which is one of the most common mouse models that recapitulates many aspects of the human pathology. The pilocarpine model of TLE appears to be highly isomorphic with the human disease including induction of acute status epilepticus, and latent period followed by the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures, as well as the occurrence of widespread lesions in the CNS (Curia et al., 2008). These features make it highly suitable for testing the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (Leite et al., 2002). We performed intraperitoneal (IP) daily injections of teriflunomide (15 mg/kg) or vehicle for 3 days, in 6-week-old male mice of C57 background. On the third day, mice were injected subcutaneously (SC) with 2 mg/kg scopolamine to prevent peripheral effects, and 30 min later with 330 mg/kg pilocarpine IP. As found, IP injections of teriflunomide significantly reduces behavioral seizure duration induced by pilocarpine (FIG. 8, p=0.0157). Because seizure duration correlates with hippocampal pathology in the pilocarpine model (Mazzuferi et al., 2012), these in vivo results emphasize the potential of DHODH inhibition as a therapeutic approach in the most common form of epilepsy.

**Example 10. DHODH Blockade Inhibits Basal CA3-CA1 Synaptic Transmission and Enhances Short-Term Synaptic Facilitation in Acute Hippocampal Slices**

Having established an essential role of DHODH activity in regulating MFR and E/I balance in hippocampal cultures, we asked whether acute DHODH inhibition modulates basal synaptic transmission in a more intact preparation—acute hippocampal slices. We evoked electrical stimulation in CA3 axons, comprising the Schaffer Collateral (SC) pathway of the hippocampus, and recorded the extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the stratum radiatum. We estimated the effect of teriflunomide (50 μM) on basal CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission evoked by low frequency stimulation of 0.1 Hz. Teriflunomide caused a gradual reduction in the fEPSP amplitude (FIG. 9A), resulting in a 66% decrease of the slope of input/output curve (FIG. 9B), and suggesting that DHODH blockade strongly inhibits basal synaptic transmission in CA3-CA1 hippocampal connections.

Next, we examined how DHODH inhibition affects short-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high-frequency spike bursts. This type of plasticity plays an important role in working memory function. As shown, application of teriflunomide resulted in a decrease of the first fEPSP amplitude within the burst, but its effect on the last amplitude was less pronounced (FIG. 9C). On average, teriflunomide profoundly increased short-term synaptic facilitation as estimated by increase in the relative fEPSP amplitude within the burst (FIG. 9D). These results suggest that DHODH inhibition tunes the filter properties of hippocampal synaptic connections, shifting it to high-pass filter properties.

**Example 11. Intrathecal Teriflunomide Injection Enhances CA3-CA1 Short-Term Synaptic Facilitation In Vivo**

Finally, we used intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of teriflunomide to test its effect on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vivo. For this, we injected teriflunomide (100 mM/1 μl daily) for 3 consecutive days and then performed electrophysiological fEPSP recording in vivo in anesthetized (2% isoflurane) mice.

The recording electrodes were placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum, while the stimulating electrode was paced at the Schaffer Collateral fibers. We examined how inhibition of DHODH in the brain affects short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus evoked by high-frequency spike bursts. ICV application of teriflunomide resulted in an increase of short-term synaptic facilitation (FIGS. 10A-B), indicating a reduction in glutamate release probability. These results suggest that intrathecal delivery of teriflunomide is effective in vivo to increase short-term synaptic facilitation.
