                        "Emerging evidence suggests that hyperactivity of hippocampal and medial temporal lobe network is common in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (Pitkanen and Sutula, 2002), mild-cognitive impairments (MCI) (Bakker et al., 2012; Dickerson et al., 2005; Yassa et al., 2010), in mildly impaired, amyloid positive older adults (Sperling et al., 2009) and young APOE-\u03b54 carriers at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Kunz et al., 2015). Further, a longitudinal fMRI study revealed that hippocampal hyperactivation in MCI predicted a greater degree of subsequent cognitive decline (Miller et al., 2008). Hippocampal hyperactivity is evident in numerous epilepsy animal models (Grone and Baraban, 2015; Krook-Magnuson and Soltesz, 2015; Paz and Huguenard, 2015), AD mouse models (Busche et al., 2008; Minkeviciene et al., 2009; Palop et al., 2007; Palop and Mucke, 2009; Verret et al., 2012) and cognitively-impaired aged rats (Koh et al., 2010). Notably, a low-dose of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam reduces metabolic hyperactivity in the hippocampus and mediates the improvement of memory in MCI patients (Bakker et al., 2012). Similarly, leviteracetam reduces brain hyperactivity and improves cognitive impairments in AD mouse models (Sanchez et al., 2012). However, all the other anti-epileptic drugs show no efficiency in attenuation of AD-related brain hyperactivity (Sanchez et al., 2012).",
                        "Despite the development of various antiepileptic drugs over the past 20 years, the efficacy of drug treatments for epilepsy has not substantially improved, and 25-40% of the patients suffer from drug-resistant seizures (Wilcox et al., 2013). New antiepileptic strategies are thus urgently needed to improve the quality of life and prevent premature deaths of patients with epilepsy. For AD patients, the impact of the currently approved FDA drugs on the disease manifestations is modest and even negligible. Over 300 different pharmacological compounds, most of which are designed to reduce A\u03b2 levels and its aggregation, are at various stages of development; however, until now clinical trials focused on anti-A\u03b2 therapies fail to show improvements of cognitive function. Thus, new therapeutic approaches aimed at reducing excitability, decreasing excitation-inhibition ratio and increasing stability of firing patterns, may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of epilepsy, MCI and early AD stages.",
                        "A recent study suggests that gene expression patterns in MCI are neither an extension of aging nor an intermediate between aging and AD, but represent a unique molecular state undergoing a nonlinear progression in the transitions from cognitively intact aging to MCI and AD (Berchtold et al., 2014). The MCI brain undergoes vast molecular reprogramming, resulting in upregulation of metabolic genes related to mitochondrial bioenergetics, mitochondrial electron transport chain (mECT) reaction, protein homeostasis and synaptic function (Berchtold et al., 2014). Gene expression changes that potentiate neuronal excitability and synaptic activity in limbic brain regions were strongly associated with impaired cognitive function. Moreover, robust changes in metabolism have been observed in epilepsy, even at the very early stages of the disease: diminished utilization of glucose (Henry et al., 1990) and shifts in glutamate metabolism were connected to the progression of the disease (Eid et al., 2004; Petroff et al., 2002). The ketogenic diet was found to be highly effective in treating epilepsy, emphasizing the importance of modifications in the metabolic network in rescuing or diminishing seizure activity (Bough et al., 2006; Lutas and Yellen, 2013). Perturbations in metabolism such as inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (Sada et al., 2015) and inhibition of glycolysis (Garriga-Canut et al., 2006) have been shown to reduce seizure activity."

                        "The protein encoded by the DHODH gene, a mitochondrial protein located on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the fourth enzymatic step, i.e., the ubiquinone-mediated oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate, in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Surprisingly, as further been found, addition of uridine (a precursor of pyrimidines) does not occlude the reduction in maximum firing rate (MFR) induced by teriflunomide at a timescale of 2 days, indicating that lack of uridine is not the factor leading to long-term reduction in the MFR, and suggesting that DHODH inhibition triggers a long-term reduction in firing rates due to its direct inhibition of mitochondrial functions, but not de-novo pyrimidine synthesis.",

The MTA is a generic genome scale metabolic modeling (GSMM) analysis approach for predicting genetic perturbations that are most likely to transform a given source metabolic state to a desired target one, which has been successfully applied to predict and experimentally validate two novel life-extending metabolic genes (Yizhak et al., 2013).",

This analysis revealed the DHODH mitochondrial enzyme as the most significantly predicted common epilepsy and MCI target that may transform diseased metabolic state into a normal healthy state. DHODH is the fourth enzyme in the pyrimidine-de-novo synthesis, catalyzing the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate and inhibiting the mETC irrespective of de-novo pyrimidine synthesis (Fang et al., 2013). Interestingly, both the DHODH inhibitor leflunomide and its active metabolite teriflunomide are used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Compston and Coles, 2008). It is assumed that DHODH inhibition targets rapidly proliferating cells such as T- and B-lymphocytes that rely on pyrimidine-de-novo synthesis and thus helps regulating the inflammatory response, but the exact mechanisms by which DHODH inhibition benefits multiple sclerosis patients is unclear (Bar-Or, 2014). Yet, whether DHODH inhibition directly regulates neuronal activity remains unknown."

As found, addition of 50 \u03bcM teriflunomide resulted in fast and stark decrease in neuronal mean firing rate (MFR, FIGS. 1D-1F, 1H), which was reduced from 3.95\u00b10.27 Hz during baseline to 1.58\u00b10.17 Hz after 4 h of teriflunomide application. Interestingly, the lower MFR induced by teriflunomide was stable for 14 hr following teriflunomide application (FIGS. 1G-1H), indicating that neuronal homeostatic mechanisms are unable to compensate DHODH-induced inhibition of firing frequency and that changes induced by teriflunomide application are stable.",

This reduction was gradually corrected over a 2-day period; however, the culture did not reach the original baseline value of 4.30\u00b10.0.44 Hz. Instead, the MFR stabilized around a lower value of 2.00\u00b10.35 Hz, closer to the one induced by teriflunomide incubation. These results suggest that homeostatic compensation mechanisms are still active under DHODH inhibition, yet are tuned to drive the steady-state of the network to a lower set-point level."

                                "In order to determine the potential therapeutic benefit of DHODH inhibition for epilepsy treatment, we used the pilocarpine model of TLE, which is one of the most common mouse models that recapitulates many aspects of the human pathology. The pilocarpine model of TLE appears to be highly isomorphic with the human disease including induction of acute status epilepticus, and latent period followed by the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures, as well as the occurrence of widespread lesions in the CNS (Curia et al., 2008). These features make it highly suitable for testing the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (Leite et al., 2002). We performed intraperitoneal (IP) daily injections of teriflunomide (15 mg/kg) or vehicle for 3 days, in 6-week-old male mice of C57 background. On the third day, mice were injected subcutaneously (SC) with 2 mg/kg scopolamine to prevent peripheral effects, and 30 min later with 330 mg/kg pilocarpine IP. As found, IP injections of teriflunomide significantly reduces behavioral seizure duration induced by pilocarpine (FIG. 8, p=0.0157). Because seizure duration correlates with hippocampal pathology in the pilocarpine model (Mazzuferi et al., 2012), these in vivo results emphasize the potential of DHODH inhibition as a therapeutic approach in the most common form of epilepsy.",
                                "**Example 10. DHODH Blockade Inhibits Basal CA3-CA1 Synaptic Transmission and Enhances Short-Term Synaptic Facilitation in Acute Hippocampal Slices**",
                                "Having established an essential role of DHODH activity in regulating MFR and E/I balance in hippocampal cultures, we asked whether acute DHODH inhibition modulates basal synaptic transmission in a more intact preparation\u2014acute hippocampal slices. We evoked electrical stimulation in CA3 axons, comprising the Schaffer Collateral (SC) pathway of the hippocampus, and recorded the extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the stratum radiatum. We estimated the effect of teriflunomide (50 \u03bcM) on basal CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission evoked by low frequency stimulation of 0.1 Hz. Teriflunomide caused a gradual reduction in the fEPSP amplitude (FIG. 9A), resulting in a 66% decrease of the slope of input/output curve (FIG. 9B), and suggesting that DHODH blockade strongly inhibits basal synaptic transmission in CA3-CA1 hippocampal connections.",
                                "Next, we examined how DHODH inhibition affects short-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high-frequency spike bursts. This type of plasticity plays an important role in working memory function. As shown, application of teriflunomide resulted in a decrease of the first fEPSP amplitude within the burst, but its effect on the last amplitude was less pronounced (FIG. 9C). On average, teriflunomide profoundly increased short-term synaptic facilitation as estimated by increase in the relative fEPSP amplitude within the burst (FIG. 9D). These results suggest that DHODH inhibition tunes the filter properties of hippocampal synaptic connections, shifting it to high-pass filter properties.",

                                "Finally, we used intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of teriflunomide to test its effect on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vivo. For this, we injected teriflunomide (100 mM/1 \u03bcl daily) for 3 consecutive days and then performed electrophysiological fEPSP recording in vivo in anesthetized (2% isoflurane) mice.",
                                "The recording electrodes were placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum, while the stimulating electrode was paced at the Schaffer Collateral fibers. We examined how inhibition of DHODH in the brain affects short-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus evoked by high-frequency spike bursts. ICV application of teriflunomide resulted in an increase of short-term synaptic facilitation (FIGS. 10A-B), indicating a reduction in glutamate release probability. These results suggest that intrathecal delivery of teriflunomide is effective in vivo to increase short-term synaptic facilitation."
