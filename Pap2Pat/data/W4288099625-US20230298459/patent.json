                        "The field of the invention relates generally to controlling connected and autonomous vehicles, and more specifically, to inter-vehicular communication for providing additional information to the controllers of the connected and autonomous vehicles.",
                        "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can utilize vehicular communication and sensor data to create situational awareness and improve driving experiences. While CAVs can rely on data from sensors such as camera and radar for local situational awareness in the vicinity of the Host Vehicle (HV), there can be driving situations desiring a larger local object map encompassing vehicles that are extremely close along with vehicles that may be comparatively distant but still important for scenario-specific situational awareness.",
                        "Secondly, there can arise numerous driving conditions where even an elementary level of communication and intention sharing among vehicles would assist in a safer driving experience, something which is not available at all with solely using sensor data.",
                        "Furthermore, existing studies and government survey data show that aggressive driving behaviors are prevalent among U.S. drivers, including aggressively switching lanes or cutting in front of another vehicle. As per police data in FARS, around 1.3% of the reported fatal crashes in 2019 were attributed to improper or erratic lane changing. The inability to communicate on road is one of the major factors contributing to selfish driving, road hostility and even road violence. Based on the NHTSA report conducted in 2015, around 95% of the estimated two million vehicle crashes in the U.S from 2005 to 2007 were a consequence of human error, out of which around 35% were due to driver decision error. Given this report along with many others, it is clear that a communication technology assisting drivers in improving their short-term and comparatively long-term driving decisions can greatly assist in reducing the number of road accidents."

Personalized messages based on vehicle connectivity can be used to connect drivers and avoid potential on-road misunderstandings and conflicts, therefore potentially directly or indirectly improve on-road safety.",

FIG. 1 represents the Driver Messenger System (DMS) process in the typical lane change scenario 100. A lane change scenario within DMS can be described as the situation where a host vehicle (HV) 105 intends to change its lane from its current lane 120 to an adjacent target lane 125. In the lane change scenario 100, the host vehicle (HV) 105 is in its current lane 120 and surrounded by one or more adjacent lanes 125.

DMS scenario detection module 215 (shown in FIG. 2) for the lane change scenario 100 is triggered as soon as the lane detection information from the local object map module 210 indicates that the host vehicle 105 is within a lane 120 and the turn signal data within the CAN (Controller Area Network) bus information from host vehicle 105 indicates that the host vehicle 105 intends to change its lane.",
                        "FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a system 200 for the Driver Messenger System 205 in accordance with at least one embodiment. The high-level framework of the Driver Messenger System 205 in FIG. 2 is from the perspective of the host vehicle 105 (shown in FIG. 1). The Driver Messenger System 205 is designed to communicate with the potential target vehicles 110 regarding the HV's upcoming scenario-specific intentions and therefore, reduce the number of human error-based crashes. The Driver Messenger System (DMS) 205 is designed to utilize the continuously updating a local object map module 210 containing basic safety information of the nearby vehicles and use it to automatically identify one or more of the pre-defined common driver-to-driver communication scenarios. Once the scenario is detected, Driver Messenger System 205 then identifies potential target vehicles 110 and sends a Driver Intent Messages (DIM) to the target vehicle 110 to inform the target vehicle 110 about the host vehicle's intention.",
                        "As shown in FIG. 2, the Driver Messenger System 205 is essentially divided into four main components: a local object map module 210, automatic scenario detection module 215, target recognition module 220, and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications 225, as detailed below.",
                        "The local object map module 210 is the initial component of the Driver Messenger System 205 within a host vehicle 105. The local object map module 210 receives data from sensors 230, local CAN Bus 235, and Vehicle-to-Everything communications 225 information as input and forms a map that contains information of the nearby vehicles and the road layout. The sensor information 230 comprises primarily of front and back radars and cameras. Aside from sensor data 230, Driver Messenger System 205 uses Vehicle-to-Everything communications 225 as well to acquire basic safety information from nearby V2X-enabled vehicles. Once the Driver Messenger System 205 within the host vehicle receives all the required information, the local object map module 210 creates a map by fusing all the received information. The resulting information is where the host vehicle 105 can gain access to a collective information of its surroundings and thus possess a better situational awareness for all its future actions. This map would be subject to updating as soon as new sensor and/or basic safety message 240 information from any nearby vehicle is available.",
                        "In the exemplary embodiment, the system 200 assumes that all participating vehicles are connected. In some embodiments, the local object map module 210 is created and updated by basic safety message 240 information received from the nearby vehicles.",
                        "The scenario detection module 215 is an essential component of the Driver Messenger System 205 since it is responsible for using the local object map module 210 and the host vehicle's own data from the CAN bus 235 to determine whether the host vehicle 105 is in one of the pre-defined traffic scenarios at any given time. Some of the common driving scenarios that have been identified within Driver Messenger System 205 may be, but are not limited to, a) Lane Change; b) Ambiguous Right-of-Way at Stop-Sign Intersections; c) Slow Traffic Ahead; d) Tailgating; e) Late Start at a Green Light; and f) Curved Roads. While the focus described herein is on the lane change scenario 100, one having skill in the art would understand that these other scenarios would also apply to the system 200 described herein.",
                        "A lane change scenario within the Driver Messenger System 205 can be described as the situation where the host vehicle 105 intends to change its lane from its current lane 120 to an adjacent target lane 125. The Driver Messenger System 205 scenario detection module 215 for the lane change scenario 100 is triggered as soon as the lane detection information from the local object map module 210 indicates that the host vehicle 105 is within a lane 120 and the turn signal data within the CAN bus information 235 from host vehicle 105 indicates that the host vehicle 105 intends to change its lane. Process 300 shown in FIG. 3 illustrates a lane change scenario 100.",
                        "Once the Driver Messenger System 205 goes past the scenario detection module 215 and identifies a scenario from the set of configured DMS scenarios, the next main objective is to identify the potential target vehicle(s) for the scenario 100 in consideration. This step allows the Driver Messenger System 205 to serve as an advanced safety feature and inform nearby relevant vehicles of the host vehicle's intentions in particular scenarios.",
                        "Once invoked, the target recognition module 220 executes an algorithm to analyze the entire local object map module 210. Based on the host vehicle's current heading, the target recognition module 220 identifies the leading and trailing vehicles up to a target vehicle distance threshold (TVdistthresh) from the host vehicle 105. TVdistthresh is a configurable parameter for lane change with the Driver Messenger System 205 and this parameter determines how far the Driver Messenger System 205 can be used to send Driver Intent Messages to target vehicles 110. The target vehicle distance threshold varies according to the scenario under consideration. The target recognition module 220 may use coordinate transformation and/or the longitudinal distance between the vehicles. Once the vehicles within TVdistthresh have been classified as trailing vehicles in Step 315, the Driver Messenger System 205 determines if one of the trailing vehicles can be classified as the target vehicle 110. The manner in which the information of leading and trailing vehicles is utilized is dependent on the DMS scenario under consideration.",
                        "For lane change scenario, once the vehicles have been classified as leading or trailing vehicles, the main objective is to determine if one or more of the trailing vehicles can be termed as the target vehicles 110. This can be done by utilizing longitudinal distance along with host vehicle's path history as explained in the subsection below. In some embodiments, the target vehicle can be termed as the trailing vehicle that is the closest vehicle to the host in the adjacent lane 125 that is the target of the host vehicle's lane change intention. This is the vehicle that would benefit the most as a result of receiving a Driver Intent Message (DIM) from the host vehicle 105 where the host vehicle 105 can inform the target vehicle of its intent to change its lane.",
                        "In at least one embodiments, a target vehicle 110 is chosen based on lateral distance between the host vehicle's and a trailing vehicle's current locations, which can be a viable TV recognition method for lane change scenario in the cases where the road topology can be characterized as straight road. However, in the cases of curved roads, this can yield false readings. To counter this, the target recognition module 220 utilizes the notion of host vehicle's path history. The target recognition module 220 can accurately identify which trailing vehicles are adjacent to the host vehicle 105 and thus qualify as a potential target vehicle 110. At every timestep, the Driver Messenger System 205 stores the location information pertaining to the host vehicle 105.",
                        "In the case of DMS lane change scenario 100 when the host vehicle 105 needs to recognize one of the trailing vehicles as a target vehicle 110, the target recognition module 220 iterates through its host vehicle's path history and chooses the closest host vehicle 105 history point (CIhist) to target vehicle's location. After finding the CIhist, the target recognition module 220 calculates the initial lateral distance between CIhist and the trailing vehicle's current location. The initial lateral distance is especially useful because it allows the target recognition module 220 to determine lane difference between the trailing vehicle 110 in consideration and host vehicle 105 when the host vehicle 105 was exactly at CIhist in the most-recent past. In some embodiments, the local object map updating is performed every 100 ms due to high basic safety message frequency. The lateral distance calculation between CIhist and the trailing vehicle 110 would yield accurate initial lane difference.",
                        "In addition to initial lateral distance between (CIhist) and trailing vehicle 110, the target recognition module 220 considers the history points between CIhist and the host vehicle's current location to determine if the host vehicle 105 ever performed a lane change in the past between those history points, as this can impact the final lane difference between host vehicle's and trailing vehicle's current locations. After finding lateral distance between CIhist and a trailing vehicle, the target recognition module 220 iterates through the history points from CIhist to the host vehicle's current location and uses the host vehicle's yaw rates on the history points to determine if there was any lane change by the host vehicle 105 that should be taken into account. This step mainly includes considering the history points and detecting prolonged irregularities in yaw rate values to suggest a lane change. This way, the Driver Messenger System 205 can detect target vehicles 110 in both of the cases of straight and curved roads.",
                        "Finally, the host vehicle 105 can also take turns on a curved road. In these embodiments, the target recognition module 220 uses the (CIhist) to detect a target vehicle 110. If the host vehicle 105 switches its lane after that, it may result in a false target vehicle 110 recognition. Therefore, in addition to choosing the (CIhist) to the target vehicle 110, the target recognition module 220 iterates through the history points from the chosen (CIhist) to the current host vehicle 105 location to determine if there was any lane change by the host vehicle 105 that should be taken into account. The target recognition module 220 does this by using the differential yaw rates of the cluster of chosen points.",
                        "The final module in the Driver Messenger System 205 is the V2X communication module 225. The V2X communication module 225 in the Driver Messenger System 205 is responsible for multiple important tasks. First, the V2X communication module 225 transmits and receives basic safety message 240 information to and from nearby vehicles for situational awareness. This information is utilized in the updating of the local object map module 210. The V2X communication module 225 also sends and receives Driver Intent Messages for DMS scenarios. In the case where the host vehicle 105 is in a lane change scenario 100, the target recognition module 220 instructs the V2X communication module 225 to send one or more Driver Intent Messages to the identified target vehicle 110. Similarly, for cases where a vehicle is designated as the target vehicle 110, the Driver Intent Message is received from the host vehicle 105 and is encoded to allow for scenario-specific message content.",
                        "FIG. 3 illustrates a process 300 for performing a lane change scenario (shown in FIG. 1) using the Driver Messenger System 205 (shown in FIG. 2).

                        "Lane change process 300 is divided into four main steps for the Driver Messenger System 205 framework described earlier. Step 305 involves receiving the updated local object map. Step 310 includes the scenario detection block where the Driver Messenger System 205 detects the host vehicle's lane change intent from the local object map, and if so, it leads to the triggering of target vehicle recognition module 220 which constitutes Step 315. If a relevant target vehicle 110 is found, the V2X communication block 225 is invoked as Step 320 where the Driver Messenger System 205 within the host vehicle 105 sends a Driver Intent Message to the target vehicle 110.",
                        "In the exemplary embodiment, the Driver Messenger System 205 receives information from the CAN bus 235. Based on the information from the CAN bus 235, the Driver Messenger System 205 determines 305 if the turn signal of host vehicle 105 is on. If the turn signal is not on, then the Driver Messenger System 205 waits 340 for the next time stamp or time period. If the turn signal is on, then the Driver Messenger System 205 updates 310 the local object map module 210 (shown in FIG. 2). The Driver Messenger System 205 filters 315 vehicle information about other vehicles 115 (shown in FIG. 1) to only include those vehicles behind the host vehicle 105. Then the Driver Messenger System 205 uses the path history of the host vehicle 105 to determine the target vehicle 110 (shown in FIG. 1) closest to the host vehicle 105 in the adjacent lane 125 (shown in FIG. 1) related to the host vehicle's lane change. The Driver Messenger System 205 transmits 325 one or more messages to the target vehicle 110. The messages can include, but are not limited to, basic safety messages 240 and/or Driver Intent Messages. In at least one embodiment, the messages inform the target vehicle 110 that the host vehicle 105 is intending to move into the target vehicle's lane.",

The target vehicle 110 can be formally termed as the trailing vehicle closest to the host vehicle in the adjacent lane 125 (shown in FIG. 1) that is the target of the host vehicle's lane change intention. This is the vehicle that would benefit the most as a result of receiving a Driver Intent Message from the host vehicle 105 where the host vehicle 105 can inform the target vehicle 110 of its intent to change its lane. The notion of host vehicle's path history and the logic behind its usage in target vehicle recognition is further explained below.",
                        "In the exemplary embodiment, the target recognition module 220 determines 405 if there are any trailing vehicles that have not been analyzed. If there are still at least one unanalyzed trailing vehicle, the target recognition module 220 chooses 410 a new vehicle to analyze. The target recognition module 220 iterates 415 through the host vehicle's path history to find the closest point in the host vehicle 105 history of locations to the current location of the trailing vehicle. The target recognition module 220 calculates 410 a longitudinal distance to determine if the trailing vehicle is in an adjacent lane 125 (shown in FIG. 1). The target recognition module 220 uses yaw rate derivatives on points from the closest point in the host vehicle 105 history of locations to the current location of the host vehicle 105 to determine if the host vehicle 105 changed lanes in its history. Based on the path history, the target recognition module 220 determines 420 if the trailing vehicle is in an adjacent lane 125 to the current lane 120 of the host vehicle 105.",
                        "If the trailing vehicle is not in an adjacent lane 125, then the target recognition module 220 returns to step 405 to start analyzing the next trailing vehicle. If the trailing vehicle is in an adjacent lane 125, the target recognition module 220 includes 425 the trailing vehicle in the potential trailing vehicle list and returns to step 405. If there are no more vehicles to analyze, the target recognition module 220 chooses 420 the closest vehicle to the host vehicle 105 from the potential target vehicle 110 list and selects as the trailing vehicle. The target recognition module 220 returns the target vehicle 110 and the Driver Messenger System 205 proceeds to step 325 in process 300.",
                        "FIG. 5 illustrates determining a lane difference between a host vehicle 105 and a target vehicle 110 (both shown in FIG. 1) using lateral difference on a straight roadway.",
                        "FIG. 6 illustrates determining a lane difference between a host vehicle 105 and a target vehicle 110 (both shown in FIG. 1) using lateral difference on a curved roadway. CIhist represents historical locations of the host vehicle 105.",
                        "As explained in detail above, one of the contributions of the Driver Messenger System 205 in the lane change scenario is that it can allow the target vehicle 110 to receive advanced information regarding the host vehicle's upcoming lane change in front of it, and thus, allow the target vehicle 110 enough time to react to it and reduce any chance of a near-collision situation with the host vehicle. In some situations, this reaction by the target vehicle 110 is translated into a manual braking maneuver performed by the target vehicle 110 once it receives a Driver Intent Message from the host vehicle 105 regarding the latter's intention of lane change. At the same time as the TV presses brakes in response to DMS message, the HV performs a lane change maneuver. This allows an increase in the inter-vehicular distance between the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle 110 which translates to an increase in time and space heading.",
                        "In addition to the benefits of using path history, the Driver Messenger System 205 is capable of providing advanced safety. Therefore, in line with the reaction model for the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle 110 in response to a lane change scenario with or without the Driver Messenger System 205, two metrics can be used to show the impact of the Driver Messenger System 205: Time and Space Headway. Time headway is defined as the time difference between the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle when they are in the same lane after host vehicle 105 changes its lane. On the other hand, space headway is defined as the longitudinal distance between the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle 110 when they are in the same lane after the host vehicle 105 changes its lane.",
                        "This can be understood by the reaction model where the Driver Messenger System 205 allows target vehicles 110 to receive Driver Intent Messages from the host vehicle 105, thereby allowing them to brake and hence, increase the heading numbers, as opposed to scenarios without the Driver Messenger System 205, which solely rely on the car following model. The space heading difference for all TVdistthresh values can be consistently higher for the Driver Messenger System 205 scenarios specially at distances within 100 m since that is where braking can result in a bigger difference in headway values and reduce near-collision situations. Similarly, time headway values in the Driver Messenger System 205 scenarios allow for an increase in time due to braking maneuver which can prove to be very beneficial specially in low-distance situations between the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle 110 since the distance and relative speed between the host vehicle 105 and the target vehicle 110 may not be small enough to force the operation of car following model but it can nevertheless be sufficient enough to take an advanced safety action of braking and increase the distance between the target vehicle 110 and the incoming host vehicle 110.",
                        "In other embodiments, there may be both connected and non-connected vehicles in the vicinity of the host vehicle 105 as well. In such cases, it becomes essential to utilize sensors such as camera and radar in conjunction with basic safety messages for vehicle localization and accurate local object map creation. Sensor usage can also become significant in the cases of a congested network causing basic safety message collisions. Accordingly, the host vehicle 105 may have to utilize sensors. Furthermore, a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) may be provided where the proposed the Driver Messenger System 205 can be embedded on an On-Board Unit and the system can be accessed using a test vehicle's dashboard tablet. This can serve to test the Driver Messenger System 205 for end-to-end capability.",
                        "The Driver Messenger System 205 works by using basic safety messages from nearby vehicles to update the vehicle's local object map. This map is then used to identify potential target vehicles 110 in the adjacent lane 125 corresponding to the host vehicle's turn signal direction. Once the target vehicle has been identified, the Driver Messenger System 205 within the host vehicle 105 sends a point-to-point Driver Intent Message to the target vehicle 110 regarding host vehicle's upcoming lane change intention. Lane changes can occur on different kinds of road segments such as straight or curved road, thus the Driver Messenger System 205 provides a method where host vehicle history locations are used to find an accurate relation between the target vehicle 110 and the host vehicle 105, especially when the target vehicle 110 is far from the host vehicle 105.",
