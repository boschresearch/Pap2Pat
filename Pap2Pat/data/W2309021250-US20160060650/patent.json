    "abstract": "A family 1 cellulose-binding-domain (CBD) encoding gene from Phytophthora infestans was used to develop transgenic Bintje potato plants. Tests with detached leaflets showed no evidence of increased or decreased resistance to P. infestans, in comparison with the susceptible Bintje controls. Changes in plant morphology were most evident in the CBD1 multicopy transgenics. Plant height increases were evident in the later growth stages, along with earlier flowering and the ability to produce seed balls. While Bintje control plants are male and female sterile, the multicopy transgenics were male sterile and female fertile. Crosses made into Bintje demonstrated the ability to transfer P. infestans targeted R genes, as well as genes responsible for color and tuber shape, into Bintje germplasm. Selection for the absence of the CBD1 transgene should allow for immediate use of the material.",

                        "Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) represent a subset of carbohydrate binding modules. CBDs are found associated with the majority of saprophyte-encoded cellulolytic enzymes; however, they are generally not found associated with plant pathogen-encoded or with plant-encoded cellulolytic enzymes (Wang and Jones. 1995a. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:2004-2006; Wang and Jones. 1995b. Gene 158:125-128). The principle function of CBDs is to mediate adherence to the carbohydrate substrate (Boraston et al. 2004. Biochem. J. 382:769-781; Nerve et al. 2010. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 107:15293-15298). An additional function can be found in the ability of some CBDs to directly dissociate cellulose microfibrils (Lehtio et al. 2003. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100:484-488). Within the CBD families, there are a few examples of CBDs that are present as independent proteins, often associated with the cell wall. An example is CBD1 from the phytopathogen Phytophthora infestans (Jones and Ospina-Giraldo. 2011. PLoS ONE 6(8):e23555). The P. infestans CBD1 protein is found tightly associated with the cellulose-containing hyphal cell wall, and may play a role in assembly and/or integrity of the cell wall. This led to the idea that expression of this protein in potato plants may alter the host:pathogen interactions through binding to the host cellulose molecules, providing a potential shield from pathogen endoglucanases, or conversely, binding to Phytophthora hyphae, providing a shield from host endoglucanases.",
                        "Since the potato industry, like other parts of the agricultural industry, is facing many challenges, as for example, the problems associated with climate change, the spread of exotic pests and pathogens, a demand for reduced use of chemicals and a need for commercially important desirable traits, new strategies for obtaining improved varieties (cultivars) of potatoes are needed, particularly for those potato varieties that are popular and widely used, but are also sterile and thus not capable of being changed by conventional breeding practices."

                        "We have transformed Potato (Solanum tuberosum) Bintje with the Phytophthora infestans Cellulose Binding Domain 1 (CBD1) gene. This invention concerns the first occurrence of induction of ovum development and seed balls in a sterile potato cultivar by expression of CBD1. The ovum development in S. tuberosum Bintje enables a previously sterile cultivar to overcome the limitations of sterility making possible fertilization by pollen from plants carrying advantageous traits.",
                        "Potatoes are the fourth most important food crop in the world, resulting in billions of dollars in economic value. Surprisingly potato production is highly dependent on two cultivars, Russet Burbank (US) and Bintje (Europe), each representing over 50% of total production. The cultivar Bintje originated in 1910, yet it remains one of the most widely used potatoes in Europe. It has high yield, grows in many different soils and has outstanding flavor. Unfortunately, some disadvantages are that it lacks disease resistance and that the tubers are short and considered unsuitable for use commercially, for example, for French fries sold by fast food franchises. Use of the CBD1 gene in transgenic Bintje will allow for introduction of new traits into a previously infertile cultivar. In progeny from preliminary crosses, we have demonstrated that resistance to the most important disease of potato (late blight caused by P. infestans) can be introduced into the highly susceptible Bintje using pollen from a potato line carrying the ARS patented Rb gene. We have demonstrated that skin color and carotenoid levels can be changed after crosses with the purple skinned, yellow fleshed Peter Wilcox potato. Progeny are selected for absence of the CBD1 transgene, providing a null-segregant population that is considered non-transgenic and is therefore a product that does not require regulation. An improved non-transgenic Bintje cultivar is critical to European development and would accelerate its use in the US. We are currently developing CBD1 transgenic Russet Burbank to determine if CBD1 can restore ovule development, as this popular cultivar is also considered sterile.",
                        "Potato breeding relies on crossing fertile pollen from one plant to the stigma of another plant. After successful fertilization, the ovule walls expand to produce a small seed ball, similar in appearance to a small unripe tomato. At maturity the seed ball may have up to 200 seeds, which are sown and screened for desired traits. Development of new potato varieties can be limited by the infertility of germplasm, where normal flowers are produced, but no seed is produced as a result of deficiencies in the pollen and/or the ovules. The mechanism(s) of potato infertility has not been identified. During the screening of various engineered potatoes, we noted that one transgene conferred the ability of an infertile potato variety (Bintje) to produce seed balls (berries). Seed ball size was correlated with the transgene copy number in the individual transformants. The original seed balls resulted from self pollination but had no seed. Reciprocal crosses with pollen from other potatoes produced large numbers of viable seed in the balls after the same pollination. The pollen from the transgenic Bintje lines failed to support seed production in other germplasm indicating that the transgenic pollen remained sterile. Thus, the effect of the transgene is on development of the seed ball structure.",
                        "The CBD1 gene used in transgenic development was discovered in our lab. The encoded CBD1 protein (SEQ ID NO:2) functions as a cellulose binding protein. It was originally found in the walls of the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which has cell walls composed of cellulosic glucans. There have been reports that cellulose binding proteins could influence plant growth, and we were testing the possibility that P. infestans may use this protein to influence plant growth. Other reports have found either growth stimulation or no effect after expressing cellulose binding proteins in plants. There are no reports on use of our transgene, or on the ability of any CBD1 to support ovule development. High copy number potato transformants produce the largest seed balls, but almost no tubers; therefore, we select away from the transgene after successful crosses are made, as the CBD1 is only needed for crossing.",
                        "We originally thought that introducing CBD1 into transgenic potato might alter the host:pathogen interaction. One way this could happen would be if CBD1 acted in a manner similar to Cladosporium fulvum AVR4, where the chitin binding AVR4 protein protects the hyphae from plant chitinases, preventing release of elicitor fragments (Westerink et al. 2002. Mol. Plant Microb. Interact. 15:1219-1227; van den Burg et al. 2006. Mol. Plant Microb. Interact. 19:1420-1430). In a soybean: Phytophthora sojae interaction, the soybean produces glucanases that attack the cellulosic P. sojae hyphae, releasing elicitor fragments. CBD1 could be one mechanism for protecting the hyphae, along with the reported glucanase inhibitor proteins (Bishop et al. 2005. Genetics 169:1009-1019). Such an interaction would be expected to lead to greater host susceptibility, but this was not seen in our studies.",
                        "An alternative possibility would be that CBD1 interacts with the host cell wall. Interactions with the host cell wall could increase susceptibility if the CBD1 acted to loosen cellulose microfibrils, or, in contrast, could reduce susceptibility if the CBD1 bound to and shielded substrates susceptible to pathogen enzymes. While there was no evidence that these mechanisms were active, based on indistinguishable differences in susceptibility between control and transgenic CBD1 plants, there was an obvious effect on gross plant morphology.",
                        "There is evidence to suggest that CBDs can interact with the plant cell wall. This is seen in the use of binding modules as molecular probes of cell wall structure (Boraston et al., supra; Herve et al., supra). It is also suggested in the limited reports of their use in transgenic plants. In one case, a family 3 CBD protein from the saprophytic bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans (Goldstein et al. 1993. J. Bacteriol. 175:5762-5768), was found to increase early growth of transgenic Desiree potato plants (Shpigel et al. 1998. Plant Physiol. 117:1185-1194; Safra-Dassa et al. 2006. Mol. Breeding 17:355-364). At higher copy numbers there was an inhibition of growth. Interestingly, our use of a family 1 CBD resulted in greater growth only at later stages of plant development, and higher copy number enhanced growth and ovule development. The use of a Family 22 xylan binding module in transgenic tobacco failed to show any apparent effects on morphology or growth rates (Obembe, O. O. 2009. African J. Biotechnol. 8:6036-6039), while another study showed a marked reduction in growth of tobacco when a tandem CBM was expressed in transgenic materials (Obembe et al. 2007. J. Plant Res. 120:605-617). Given the variable effects of CBDs in transgenic plants, there can be no assumptions made about the effect of any carbohydrate binding modules until tested.",
                        "An unusual feature of the Phytophthora CBD 1 transgenic Bintje is the effect on ovule formation. Even in the absence of fertilization, the transgenic plants are able to produce seed balls. This would be similar to parthenocarpic fruit development, where fruit develops in the absence of seed development. This has been engineered into Solanaceous crops through manipulation of tissue-targeted auxin production (Rotino et al. 1997. Nat. Biotechnol. 15:1398-1401). After successful fertilization, the Bintje seed balls are larger than those produced without fertilization, indicating a normal interaction between seed development and ovule growth. Auxin has a well known role in causing cell wall loosening and cell expansion through induction of various plant-encoded carbohydrate modifying enzymes (Nishitani and Masuda. 1981. Physiol Plantarum 52:482-494).",
                        "The mechanism of CBD1-mediated ovule development remains to be characterized, however, CBD1 expression can be a useful tool for developing the Bintje gene pool, one that hasn't changed since 1904 (Stevenson, F. 1966. Amer. J. Potato Res. 43:458-459). The cultivar Bintje is one of the most widely grown European cultivars (Retrieved from the Internet: europotato.org) due to strong yields, growth under variable conditions, and excellent flavor after multiple different cooking methods. Current limitations are lack of disease resistance and smaller tuber size.",
                        "We demonstrate the ability to integrate single gene late blight resistance as well as color changes into the Bintje gene pool. Selection can be made for Bintje progeny that lack the CBD1 transgene, as its primary value is in breeding. This will allow for improved Bintje without carryover of transgenes, for those markets where that is desired.",
                        "\u201cTransformation\u201d refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the genome of a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as \u201ctransgenic\u201d organisms. Examples of methods of plant transformation include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (De Blaere et al. 1987. Meth. Enzymol. 143:277) and particle-accelerated or \u201cgene gun\u201d transformation technology (Klein et al. 1987. Nature (London) 327:70-73; U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,050, incorporated herein by reference). Additional transformation methods are disclosed below. Thus, isolated polynucleotides of the present invention can be incorporated into recombinant constructs, typically DNA constructs, capable of introduction into and replication in a host cell. Such a construct can be a vector that includes a replication system and sequences that are capable of transcription and translation of a polypeptide-encoding sequence in a given host cell. A number of vectors suitable for stable transfection of plant cells or for the establishment of transgenic plants have been described in, e.g., Pouwels et al. 1985. Supp. 1987. Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual; Weissbach and Weissbach. 1989. Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, New York; and Flevin et al. 1990. Plant Molecular Biology Manual, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston. Typically, plant expression vectors include, for example, one or more cloned plant genes under the transcriptional control of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regulatory sequences and a dominant selectable marker. Such plant expression vectors also can contain a promoter regulatory region (e.g., a regulatory region controlling inducible or constitutive, environmentally- or developmentally-regulated, or cell- or tissue-specific expression), a transcription initiation start site, a ribosome binding site, an RNA processing signal, a transcription termination site, and/or a polyadenylation signal.",

                        "\u201cPromoter\u201d refers to a nucleotide sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3\u2032 to a promoter sequence. The promoter sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers. Accordingly, an \u201cenhancer\u201d is a nucleotide sequence that can stimulate promoter activity and may be an innate element of the promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the level or tissue-specificity of a promoter. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic nucleotide segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different tissues or cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions. The tissue-specificity of a promoter, for example, is exemplified by the promoter sequence which specifically induces gene expression in root tips. Promoters that cause a nucleic acid fragment to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as \u201cconstitutive promoters\u201d. New promoters of various types useful in plant cells are constantly being discovered; numerous examples may be found in the compilation by Okamuro and Goldberg. 1989. Biochemistry of Plants 15:1-82. It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, nucleic acid fragments of different lengths may have identical promoter activity.",

The cDNA can be single-stranded or converted to double stranded form using, for example, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. \u201cSense\u201d RNA refers to an RNA transcript that includes the mRNA and so can be translated into a polypeptide by the cell. \u201cAntisense\u201d, when used in the context of a particular nucleotide sequence, refers to the complementary strand of the reference transcription product. \u201cAntisense RNA\u201d refers to an RNA transcript that is complementary to all or part of a target primary transcript or mRNA and that blocks the expression of a target gene. The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific nucleotide sequence, i.e., at the 5\u2032 non-coding sequence, 3\u2032 non-coding sequence, introns, or the coding sequence. \u201cFunctional RNA\u201d refers to sense RNA, antisense RNA, ribozyme RNA, or other RNA that may not be translated but yet has an effect on cellular processes.",

The mature seed balls did not contain matured seed. Two sets of reciprocal crosses were made using Bintje as the female parent. Pollen from a transgenic Lenape containing the RB gene from Solanum bulbocastatum (Rommens et al. 2007. Trends Plant Sci. 12:397-403) was applied to the stigma of Bintje transgenics B-23 and B-48.

Leaflets from 6 week old greenhouse grown potato plants were detached from the center of the plants and placed onto moistened paper towels in incubation trays.

Single gene resistance to late blight was successfully transmitted from a transgenic Lenape harboring a copy of the RB gene as evidenced by the fact that a subset of progeny of the cross between CBD1 transgenic B-48 and Lenape E10 transgenic for RB are fully resistant to late blight. Nine progeny were tested for late blight resistance, four were susceptible like the CBD1-Bintje parent.
