    "abstract": "Integrin activation in response to inside-out signaling serves as the basis for rapid leukocyte arrest on endothelium, migration, and mobilization of immune cells. Integrin-dependent adhesion is controlled by the conformational state of the molecule, which is regulated by seven-transmembrane Guanine nucleotide binding Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). \u03b14\u03b21-integrin (CD49d/CD29, Very Late Antigen-4, VLA-4) is expressed on leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors, stem cells, hematopoietic cancer cells, and others. VLA-4 conformation is rapidly up-regulated by inside-out signaling through G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs and down-regulated by G\u03b1s-coupled GPCRs. However, other signaling pathways, which include nitric oxide-dependent signaling, have been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion. The goal of the current report was to study the effect of nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway on VLA-4 conformational regulation. Using fluorescent ligand binding to evaluate the integrin activation state on live cells in real-time, we show that several small molecules, which specifically modulate nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway, as well as a cell permeable cGMP analog, can rapidly down-modulate binding of a VLA-4 specific ligand on cells pre-activated through three G\u03b1i-coupled receptors: wild type CXCR4, CXCR2 (IL-8RB), and a non-desensitizing mutant of formyl peptide receptor (FPR \u0394ST). Upon signaling, we detected rapid changes in the ligand dissociation rate. The dissociation rate after inside-out integrin de-activation was similar to the rate for resting cells. In a VLA-4/VCAM-1-specific myeloid cell adhesion system, inhibition of the VLA-4 affinity change by nitric oxide had a statistically significant effect on real-time cell aggregation. We conclude that nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can rapidly down-modulate the affinity state of the VLA-4 binding pocket, especially under the condition of sustained G\u03b1i-coupled GPCR signaling, generated by a non-desensitizing receptor mutant. This suggests a fundamental role of this pathway in de-activation of integrin-dependent cell adhesion.",

                "Integrins are ubiquitous cell adhesion molecules that play an essential role in the regulation of leukocyte traffic, stem cell mobilization and homing, immune responses, development, hemostasis, and cancer [1-3]. On the cell surface at rest, a variety of integrin exhibit a non-adhesive inactive state and multiple signaling cascades are capable of rapidly and reversibly regulating integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Typically, this regulation is achieved without altering the integrin expression level. Conformational changes within the molecule, together with a spatial reorganization of integrins, are responsible for the rapid modulation of cell adhesion [1,4-6]. Understanding signaling pathways that regulate activation and, especially, inactivation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion is crucial, as integrins are implicated in many human diseases [7-9]. Several existing and emerging drugs for treating inflammatory diseases, anti-angiogenic cancer therapy, anti-thrombotic therapy, and others specifically target integrin molecules [10-12]. Moreover, interfering with integrin activation by targeting \"the final steps of activation process\" is envisioned as a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in integrin-related pathologies [13].",
                "Very Late Antigen-4, VLA-4, (\u03b14\u03b21-integrin, CD49d/CD29) is expressed on a majority of peripheral blood leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, as well as hematopoietic cancer cells [2,14,15]. VLA-4 has the potential to exhibit multiple affinity (conformational) states that mediate tethering, rolling, and firm arrest on VCAM-1 (CD106, Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1) [16-18]. The VLA-4 conformational state is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that operate as receptors for multiple chemokines and chemoattractants. The majority of receptors activating VLA-4 are G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs that function by inhibiting adenylate cyclase and inducing calcium mobilization. These include CXCR2, CXCR4, and others [19]. G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs activate integrin by triggering the so-called inside-out signaling pathway [20], which leads to a rapid increase in ligand binding affinity that is translated into the \"rapid development of firm adhesion\" [18].",
                "Recently, in addition to the inside-out integrin activation pathway, we described a de-activation signaling pathway that can rapidly down-regulate the binding affinity state of the VLA-4 binding pocket. Two G\u03b1s-coupled GPCRs (histamine H2 receptor and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors), an adenylyl cyclase activator, and a cell permeable analog of cAMP showed the ability to regulate VLA-4 ligand binding affinity as well as VLA-4/VCAM-1 dependent cell adhesion on live cells in real-time [21]. Based on these findings we hypothesized that other de-activating inside-out signaling pathways might exist. Review of the literature indicated that nitric oxide/cGMP-dependent signaling pathway could be one of them.",
                "Both cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling pathways play an inhibitory role in GPCR-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion [22], which is known to be critically dependent on the activation state of platelet integrins [23,24]. Cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases (PKA and PKG) share a strong sequence homology and exhibit overlapping substrate specificity [25]. Nitric oxide signaling is critical for hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell mobilization [26,27], a physiological process that is critically dependent on the interaction between VLA-4 integrin and VCAM-1 [28-32]. Nitric oxide is also shown to antagonize GPCR signaling in muscle cells [33]. The molecular mechanism by which nitric oxide regulates integrin-dependent adhesion is under active investigation. Several reports indicate that direct s-nitrosylation of cytoskeletal proteins [34], or integrins themselves [35], can be involved in the regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion. The goal of the current manuscript was to investigate the effects of exogenous nitric oxide, and other cGMP pathway regulators on VLA-4 conformational regulation on live cells in real-time.",
                "We found that the addition of a nitric oxide donor can rapidly induce dissociation of the VLA-4 specific ligand after cellular activation by any of three GPCRs (CXCR4, CXCR2, and FPR). The effect of nitric oxide was also mimicked by a NO-independent cGMP-cyclase activator, as well as a cell permeable analog of cGMP. This indicates that the integrin deactivation mechanism is intracellular, and suggests that deactivation is not related to direct s-nitrosylation. We also detected rapid changes in the dissociation rate constant (koff) of the VLA-4 specific ligand. As shown previously, modulation of the koff directly correlates with changes in the VLA-4 ligand binding affinity [14,17]. Finally, using a VLA-4/VCAM-1 specific cell adhesion system, we showed that treatment of cells with a nitric oxide donor diminished GPCR activated cell adhesion to the level of unstimulated (untreated) cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the NO/cGMP signaling pathway can actively down-regulate the affinity of the VLA-4 ligand binding pocket. This observation provides a molecular mechanism for the anti-adhesive activity of nitric oxide donors and drugs that modulate cGMP signaling pathway."

                        "The nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway has been described in mature leukocytes, platelets, and hematopoietic progenitors. It is composed of soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) that serves as an intracellular receptor for nitric oxide (Figure 1). Upon binding to NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase, nitric oxide induces a conformational change resulting in the activation of the enzyme [36], and conversion of GTP to cGMP. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate binding leads to the subsequent activation of the cGMP dependent kinase PKG that phosphorylates multiple substrates, and participates in the regulation of platelet adhesion and aggregation [37].",
                        "To study the effects of nitric oxide/cGMP signaling in leukocytes, we selected three small molecules that specifically target this pathway (Figure 1). Diethylamine NONOate can be described as a complex of diethylamine with nitric oxide. It is unstable in aqueous solution and used as nitric oxide donor [38]. BAY 41-2272 is an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which stimulates cGMP production through an NO-independent mechanism [39,40]. N2,2'-O-dibutyrylguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate is a cell permeable cGMP analog that activates protein kinase G [41]. These molecules are shown to stimulate the three initial consecutive steps of the pathway (Figure 1), and therefore, can be used to mimic NO-dependent signaling."

                        "Previously, we described and characterized in detail a model ligand an LDV-FITC containing small molecule ([14,42-44], and references therein) for the detection of VLA-4 conformational regulation. This VLA-4 specific fluorescent probe was based on a highly specific \u03b14\u03b21-integrin inhibitor BIO1211, which contains the Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) ligand binding motif from the alternatively spliced connecting segment-1 (CS-1) peptide of cellular fibronectin [17,45]. We established that integrin affinity changes, detected using this probe, vary in parallel with the natural VLA-4 ligand, human VCAM-1 [46]. For real-time detection of rapid integrin conformational changes, cells were treated with LDV-FITC (Figure 2, first arrow), which was added after establishing a baseline for unstained cells, indicated on Figure 2A as \"autofluorescence\". Next, data were acquired for 2-3 minutes, and cells were activated with fMLFF (high affinity FPR ligand), CXCL12/SDF-1 (CXCR4 ligand), or CXCL8/IL-8 (CXCR2 ligand), for FPR, CXCR4, CXCR2 transfected cells, respectively (Figure 2A, B, and 2C). The concentration of the LDV-FITC probe used in the experiments (4 nM) was below the dissociation constant (Kd) for its binding to resting VLA-4 (low affinity state, Kd ~ 12 nM), and above the Kd for physiologically activated VLA-4 (high affinity state, Kd ~ 1-2 nM) [14]. Therefore, the transition from the low affinity to the high affinity receptor state led to increased binding of the probe (from ~25% to ~70-80% of receptor occupancy, as calculated based on the one site binding equation). The change in occupancy was detected as a rapid increase in the mean channel fluorescence (MCF). This signal increase was sustained for the case of a non-desensitizing mutant of FRP (Figure 2A), and reversible for the wild-type receptors (CXCR4, and CXCR2, Figure 2B,C). Next, cells were treated with the nitric oxide donor, or vehicle (control). Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously for up to 720-840 s. Addition of the nitric oxide donor resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent decrease in the binding of the VLA-4 specific ligand. In the absence of receptor desensitization, the effect of nitric oxide was more evident in cells transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR (vehicle, Figure 2A) [47,48]. However, the effect of the nitric oxide donor was statistically significant for both wild-type GPCRs. A faster and more pronounced signal decrease was detected (see black lines in Figure 2B, 2C). To emphasize statistically the difference between control and experimental samples, standard errors of mean are indicated using error bars for every experimental point in Figure 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E.",
                        "Next, we studied the effect of nitric oxide donor added prior to cell activation. DEA-NONOate was added at the 0 time point as indicated by the arrow (Figure 2D, 2E). This resulted in a significant decrease in the magnitude of the response for both SDF-1 and IL-8 treated cells. Moreover, the effect of nitric oxide can be detected prior to cell activation. This suggests that at rest a small number of VLA-4 molecules exists in the activated conformation, and addition of nitric oxide donor deactivates these integrins. It worth noting that the nonspecific binding of the LDV-FITC probe remained identical for both control and treated samples (compare sample fluorescence after addition of LDV). Thus, the nitric oxide donor rapidly decreased binding of the VLA-4 specific fluorescent ligand after cell activation through three G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs. Pretreatment with the nitric oxide donor significantly diminished the magnitude of the response."

                        "To confirm that the effect of nitric oxide can be mimicked using a nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, we repeated the experiments shown in Figure 2A using BAY 41-2272 (Figure 3A). Cells, transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR, were sequentially treated with LDV-FITC (4 nM), fMLFF, vehicle, or indicated concentrations of the soluble guanylyl cyclase activator. We observed a significant decrease in LDV-FITC binding, comparable to the effect induced by the nitric oxide donor (Figure 2A). However, the decrease in LDV-FITC binding was partially reversible. This phenomenon can be rationalized, in terms of the proposed feedback loops that regulate cGMP production. Intracellular cGMP can directly stimulate the catalytic activity of several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that hydrolyze cGMP [49-51]. Another possibility is activation of PDEs through phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (Figure 1) [50-53].",

This resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the response for both SDF-1 and IL-8 treated cells in a manner comparable to the effect of nitric oxide donor. Similarly, the effect of activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase can be detected prior to cell activation. Thus, the nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase induces a dose-dependent decrease in binding of the VLA-4 specific ligand, and pretreatment with the activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase significantly diminished the magnitude of the response after activation."

                        "As shown previously, for different states of VLA-4 affinity, the LDV-FITC equilibrium dissociation constant Kd varied inversely with the dissociation rate constant (koff). This implies that the ligand association rate constant is essentially independent of receptor conformation (for example see Table I in [17]), or Table I in [14]). Therefore, the dissociation rate analysis can be used to assess the affinity state of the VLA-4 integrin binding pocket.",
                        "To saturate the majority of low affinity sites, cells transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR were preincubated with a higher concentration of the VLA-4 specific ligand (25 nM). Since the Kd for the low affinity state is ~12 nM (Table I in [14]), at 25 nM ~70% of sites are occupied before activation. Next, an excess of the unlabeled LDV competitor (labeled on Figure 3D as \"LDV block\") is added to induce dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe. After activation by fMLFF, because of the rapid affinity change, little additional binding of the probe was seen (Figure 3D, green and red lines). Addition of the nitric oxide-independent activator of the soluble guanylyl cyclase returned the binding of the probe to a level similar to the binding before fMLFF addition.",
                        "Next, the regions of the ligand-binding curves corresponding to the dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe were fitted to a single exponential decay equation. The resulting dissociation rate constants (koff, s-1) are shown graphically in Figure 3E. At rest, the majority of the VLA-4 molecules exhibit rapid probe dissociation, corresponding to the low affinity state of the ligand binding pocket (Figure 3D, 3E, blue curve \"LDV-FITC, LDV block\", koff ~ 0.04 \u00b1 0.001 s-1). After cell activation by fMLFF, the dissociation rate was significantly slower (Figure 3D, 3E, red curve \"LDV-FITC, fMLFF, LDV block\", koff ~ 0.018 \u00b1 0.0001 s-1). The slower koff corresponds to higher ligand binding affinity [14,17,46]. After the addition of the nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, dissociation rates were comparable to the rate for the resting state (Figure 3D, 3E, green curve \"LDV-FITC, fMLFF, BAY 41-2272, LDV block\", koff ~ 0.036 \u00b1 0.0007 s-1). This suggests that activation of guanylyl cyclase can actively down-regulate the affinity state of the VLA-4 integrin ligand binding pocket, even under the condition with the continuously signaling non-desensitizing GPCR mutant. The affinity state induced by guanylyl cyclase activator was quantitatively similar to the resting state before activation. The resting VLA-4 conformation on U937 cells exhibits the lowest physiological affinity. It is worth noting, that this result is comparable to the effect of G\u03b1s-coupled GPCRs on VLA-4 conformation (compare Figure 3D in the current manuscript and Figure 2C, 2D in [21]). This result is especially interesting in light of the structural relationship of the two second messengers cAMP and cGMP, originating from these signaling pathways."

Next, the cell populations were mixed, and the appearance of double positive events, representing cellular aggregates, was followed in real-time by flow cytometry (see Figure 1, 2, 3 in [55] for method details). Because nitric oxide represents a \"natural\" signaling molecule, and the effect of nitric oxide was not reversible during the first several hundred seconds after treatment (Figure 2A), for aggregation experiments cell were treated with the NO-donor (Figure 5). Resting (unstimulated) cells showed a very small increase in the % U937 cells in the cell aggregate (Figure 5, light gray line, labeled \"with vehicle\"). Inside-out activation resulted in a rapid increase in cell aggregation during the first six minutes after mixing the cell populations (Figure 5, black line, labeled \"with fMLFF only\"). Addition of the unlabelled VLA-4 specific ligand \"LDV block\" resulted in rapid cellular disaggregation, indicating that the majority of aggregates were VLA-4 dependent. The overall extent of activated cell aggregation was similar to previously published data [46]. Pretreatment of U937 cells with fMLFF, and subsequently with nitric oxide donor, in a manner similar to the Figure 2A, abolished fMLFF-dependent cellular aggregation (gray line, labeled \"with fMLFF and DEA-NONOate\"). In fact, cell aggregation in this experiment was very similar to the aggregation of the resting cell (untreated control). Thus, treatment of activated cells with NO-donor only abolished the effect of GPCR-dependent cell activation, and did not affect resting cell aggregation. This result is additionally supported by the LDV-FITC ligand binding kinetics data (Figure 3B, 3C). Activation of guanylyl cyclase induced a rapid decrease of the VLA-4 ligand binding affinity to a level that was quantitatively similar to the resting state. Thus, the NO/cGMP signaling pathway provides an antagonistic signal that can rapidly and actively decrease the affinity state of the VLA-4 ligand binding pocket, and this results in the modulation of VLA-4/VCAM-1 dependent cellular aggregation."

An \"updated\" adhesion cascade includes several steps in addition to the traditional tethering, rolling, and arrest [57]. While integrin adhesion research is largely focused on activating pathways, the inhibitory G\u03b1s-coupled GPCR/cAMP-dependent signaling pathways is acknowledged for platelet regulation [58]. The relative lack of interest in the integrin deactivation pathways is potentially compensated by the identification of antagonists that competitively block adhesive interactions, and thus, provide a desirable therapeutic effect [59].",
                        "However, it is arguable that deactivation of the signaling pathway is as appealing as a direct blockade of the activating signaling using receptor antagonists. It was established, that in order to induce a half-optimal elevation of the signal in leukocytes, only a very small fraction of occupied cellular receptors is required. In some cases, this fraction may be less than 0.1% of the total number of receptors [60]. This is dependent on significant signal amplification for both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways [61]. Therefore, from a therapeutic point of view, it would be very difficult to completely block the occupancy of activating chemokine receptors using receptor-specific antagonists. A small fraction of activating receptors occupied by the ligand, may be sufficient to trigger the adhesion signal. A plausible scenario would be to take advantage of natural regulatory pathways to counteract unwanted signaling, especially because antagonistic pathways potentially have similar amplification capacity [60,61]."

Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), one of the major enzymes, producing nitric oxide in the vasculature, is essential for the mobilization of stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow stem cell niche. Mice lacking eNOS showed a defect in progenitor mobilization [26]. Nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide regulates the bone marrow environment, and is envisioned as a direct mediator of cell mobilization [27]. Our current finding that nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can actively down-regulate VLA-4 affinity, even under conditions of constant signaling, induced by a non-desensitizing mutant of GPCR, indicates that VLA-4 conformational deactivation provides a plausible explanation for the molecular basics of nitric oxide signaling-induced progenitor mobilization."

Although, the existence and metabolism of cCMP in mammals is uncertain [65], recent report suggests that the adenylyl cyclase toxin edema factor and adenylate cyclase-hemolysin (CyaA), produced by Bacillus anthracis and Bordetella pertussis, can catalyze the formation of cCMP, and other cyclic nucleotides [66]. The ability of cCMP to down-modulate immune cell adhesion, and thus, decrease immune response could be a part of a host immunity subversion strategy.

Cyclic AMP is known to rapidly decrease LFA-1 dependent cell adhesion [68], and binding of the ligand to activated LFA-1 can be rapidly and reversible down-modulated in a manner identical to VLA-4 [21,69]. So far the information is limited for other integrins.",
                        "Are there existing drugs in use today that take advantage of these signaling pathways? The success of PDE5 inhibitors, blocking hydrolysis of cGMP, and currently used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction stimulated significant interest in other therapeutic applications of the NO/cGMP-dependent signaling pathway. Studies on different PDE inhibitors show potential in anti-inflammatory therapy. Currently, a large number of preclinical in vivo studies on PDE inhibitors exhibit decreased cell recruitment, activation of inflammatory cells and physiological changes in lung function in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and others [70,71]. cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor showed anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in a model of psoriasis [72]. Thus, our finding that NO/cGMP pathway directly regulates integrin-dependent immune cell adhesion provides the rationale for repositioning of existing drugs toward pathologies, where integrin-mediated excessive immune cell adhesion/recruitment is envisioned to be detrimental."

                "We conclude that the nitric oxide/cGMP signalling pathway dramatically decreases the up-regulation of VLA-4 integrin ligand-binding affinity, when triggered prior to inside-out integrin activation, and rapidly down-modulates VLA-4 affinity, when induced after integrin activation. This conformational change results in a significant down-regulation of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion, suggesting a major role of this pathway in the regulation of inside-out integrin de-activation and cell de-adhesion (mobilization)."

                        "Kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe was described previously [14,46]. Briefly, cells (1 \u00d7 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% HSA or RPMI under different incubating conditions for 10-20 min at 37\u00b0C. Flow cytometric data were acquired for up to 1024 s at 37\u00b0C while the samples were stirred continuously at 300 rpm with a 5 \u00d7 2 mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products). For real-time affinity activation experiments, 4 nM LDV-FITC was added after establishing a baseline for unstained cells marked on figures as \"autofluorescence\". Next, different ligands were added and acquisition was re-established, creating a 5-10 s gap in the time course. For activation, cells were treated with different GPCR ligands at saturating concentration (10 times or higher than Kd). In several experiments cells were treated sequentially with two different compounds. Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously for up to 1024 s. The concentration of the LDV-FITC probe used in the experiments (4 nM) was below the dissociation constant (Kd) for its binding to resting VLA-4 (low affinity state, Kd ~ 12 nM), and above the Kd for physiologically activated VLA-4 (high affinity state, Kd ~ 1-2 nM) [14]. Therefore, the transition from the low affinity to the high affinity receptor state led to increased binding of the probe (from ~25% to ~70-80% of receptor occupancy, as calculated based on the one site binding equation), which was detected as an increase in the mean channel fluorescence (MCF). For kinetic dissociation measurements, cell samples were preincubated with the fluorescent probe (25 nM), treated with excess unlabeled LDV containing small molecule (2 \u03bcM) and the dissociation of the fluorescent molecule was followed. The resulting data were converted to MCF versus time using FCSQuery software developed by Dr. Bruce Edwards (University of New Mexico)."
