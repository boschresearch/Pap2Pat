                        "Integrin activation in response to inside-out signaling serves as the basis for rapid leukocyte arrest on endothelium, migration, and mobilization of immune cells. Integrin-dependent adhesion is controlled by the conformational state of the molecule, which is regulated by seven-transmembrane Guanine nucleotide binding Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). \u03b14\u03b21-integrin (CD49d/CD29, Very Late Antigen-4, VLA-4) is expressed on leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors, stem cells, hematopoietic cancer cells, and others. VLA-4 conformation is rapidly up-regulated by inside-out signaling through G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs and down-regulated by G\u03b1s-coupled GPCRs.",
                        "Thus, integrins are ubiquitous cell adhesion molecules that play an essential role in the regulation of leukocyte traffic, stem cell mobilization and homing, immune responses, development, hemostasis, and cancer [1-3]. On the cell surface at rest, a variety of integrin exhibit a non-adhesive inactive state and multiple signaling cascades are capable of rapidly and reversibly regulating integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Typically, this regulation is achieved without altering the integrin expression level. Conformational changes within the molecule, together with a spatial reorganization of integrins, are responsible for the rapid modulation of cell adhesion [1, 4-6]. Understanding signaling pathways that regulate activation and, especially, inactivation of integrin-mediated cell adhesion is crucial, as integrins are implicated in many human diseases [7-9]. Several existing and emerging drugs for treating inflammatory diseases, anti-angiogenic cancer therapy, anti-thrombotic therapy, and others specifically target integrin molecules [10-12]. Moreover, interfering with integrin activation by targeting \u201cthe final steps of activation process\u201d is envisioned as a novel approach for therapeutic intervention in integrin-related pathologies [13].",
                        "Very Late Antigen-4, VLA-4, (\u03b14\u03b21-integrin, CD49d/CD29) is expressed on a majority of peripheral blood leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, as well as hematopoietic cancer cells [2, 14, 15]. VLA-4 has the potential to exhibit multiple affinity (conformational) states that mediate tethering, rolling, and firm arrest on VCAM-1 (CD106, Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1) [16-18]. The VLA-4 conformational state is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that operate as receptors for multiple chemokines and chemoattractants. The majority of receptors activating VLA-4 are G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs that function by inhibiting adenylate cyclase and inducing calcium mobilization. These include CXCR2, CXCR4, and others [19]. G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs activate integrin by triggering the so-called inside-out signaling pathway [20], which leads to a rapid increase in ligand binding affinity that is translated into the \u201crapid development of firm adhesion\u201d [18].",
                        "Recently, in addition to the inside-out integrin activation pathway, we described a de-activation signaling pathway that can rapidly down-regulate the binding affinity state of the VLA-4 binding pocket. Two G\u03b1s-coupled GPCRs (histamine H2 receptor and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors), an adenylyl cyclase activator, and a cell permeable analog of cAMP showed the ability to regulate VLA-4 ligand binding affinity as well as VLA-4/VCAM-1 dependent cell adhesion on live cells in real-time [21].",
                        "Both cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG signaling pathways play an inhibitory role in GPCR-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion [22], which is known to be critically dependent on the activation state of platelet integrins [23, 24]. Cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases (PKA and PKG) share a strong sequence homology and exhibit overlapping substrate specificity [25]. Nitric oxide signaling is critical for hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell mobilization [26, 27], a physiological process that is critically dependent on the interaction between VLA-4 integrin and VCAM-1 [28-32]. Nitric oxide is also shown to antagonize GPCR signaling in muscle cells [33]. The molecular mechanism by which nitric oxide regulates integrin-dependent adhesion is under active investigation. Several reports indicate that direct s-nitrosylation of cytoskeletal proteins [34], or integrins themselves [35], can be involved in the regulation of integrin-dependent adhesion.",
                        "An understanding of the effects of exogenous nitric oxide and other cGMP pathway regulators on VLA-4 conformational regulation would yield improved methods of treating and diagnosing wide variety of disorders implicated by VLA-4-related cell adhesion."

                        "We have discovered that nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can actively down-regulate VLA-4 affinity, even under conditions of constant signaling. The nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can rapidly down-modulate the affinity state of the VLA-4 binding pocket, especially under the condition of sustained G\u03b1i-coupled GPCR signalling generated by a non-desensitizing receptor mutant. This suggests a fundamental role of this pathway in de-activation of integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Our finding that NO/cGMP pathway directly regulates integrin-dependent immune cell adhesion enables the repositioning of existing drugs toward pathologies where integrin-mediated excessive immune cell adhesion/recruitment is envisioned to be detrimental.",

                        "As described in U.S. Patent Application Document No. 20100284921, \u201cantibodies . . . may be polyclonal or monoclonal. Monoclonal antibodies are preferred. The antibody is preferably a chimeric antibody. For human use, the antibody is preferably a humanized chimeric antibody.",
                        "An anti-target-structure antibody may be monovalent, divalent or polyvalent in order to achieve target structure binding. Monovalent immunoglobulins are dimers (HL) formed of a hybrid heavy chain associated through disulfide bridges with a hybrid light chain. Divalent immunoglobulins are tetramers (H2L2) formed of two dimers associated through at least one disulfide bridge.",
                        "The invention also includes [use of] functional equivalents of the antibodies described herein. Functional equivalents have binding characteristics comparable to those of the antibodies, and include, for example, hybridized and single chain antibodies, as well as fragments thereof. Methods of producing such functional equivalents are disclosed in PCT Application Nos. WO 1993/21319 and WO 1989/09622. Functional equivalents include polypeptides with amino acid sequences substantially the same as the amino acid sequence of the variable or hypervariable regions of the antibodies raised against target integrins according to the practice of the present invention.",
                        "Functional equivalents of the anti-target-structure antibodies further include fragments of antibodies that have the same, or substantially the same, binding characteristics to those of the whole antibody. Such fragments may contain one or both Fab fragments or the F(ab\u2032).sub.2 fragment. Preferably the antibody fragments contain all six complement determining regions of the whole antibody, although fragments containing fewer than all of such regions, such as three, four or five complement determining regions, are also functional. The functional equivalents are members of the IgG immunoglobulin class and subclasses thereof, but may be or may combine any one of the following immunoglobulin classes: IgM, IgA, IgD, or IgE, and subclasses thereof. Heavy chains of various subclasses, such as the IgG subclasses, are responsible for different effector functions and thus, by choosing the desired heavy chain constant region, hybrid antibodies with desired effector function are produced. Preferred constant regions are gamma 1 (IgG1), gamma 2 (IgG2 and IgG), gamma 3 (IgG3) and gamma 4 (IgG4). The light chain constant region can be of the kappa or lambda type.",
                        "The monoclonal antibodies may be advantageously cleaved by proteolytic enzymes to generate fragments retaining the target structure binding site. For example, proteolytic treatment of IgG antibodies with papain at neutral pH generates two identical so-called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each containing one intact light chain disulfide-bonded to a fragment of the heavy chain (Fc). Each Fab fragment contains one antigen-combining site. The remaining portion of the IgG molecule is a dimer known as \u201cFc\u201d. Similarly, pepsin cleavage at pH 4 results in the so-called F(ab\u2032)2 fragment.",
                        "Single chain antibodies or Fv fragments are polypeptides that consist of the variable region of the heavy chain of the antibody linked to the variable region of the light chain, with or without an interconnecting linker. Thus, the Fv comprises an antibody combining site.",
                        "Hybrid antibodies may be employed. Hybrid antibodies have constant regions derived substantially or exclusively from human antibody constant regions and variable regions derived substantially or exclusively from the sequence of the variable region of a monoclonal antibody from each stable hybridoma.",
                        "Methods for preparation of fragments of antibodies (e.g. for preparing an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof having specific binding affinity for cGMP or VLA-4 are either described in the experiments herein or are otherwise known to those skilled in the art. See, Goding, \u201cMonoclonal Antibodies Principles and Practice\u201d, Academic Press (1983), p. 119-123. Fragments of the monoclonal antibodies containing the antigen binding site, such as Fab and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, may be preferred in therapeutic applications, owing to their reduced immunogenicity. Such fragments are less immunogenic than the intact antibody, which contains the immunogenic Fc portion. Hence, as used herein, the term \u201cantibody\u201d includes intact antibody molecules and fragments thereof that retain antigen binding ability.",
                        "When the antibody used in the practice of the invention is a polyclonal antibody (IgG), the antibody is generated by inoculating a suitable animal with a target structure or a fragment thereof. Antibodies produced in the inoculated animal that specifically bind the target structure are then isolated from fluid obtained from the animal. Anti-target-structure antibodies may be generated in this manner in several non-human mammals such as, but not limited to, goat, sheep, horse, rabbit, and donkey. Methods for generating polyclonal antibodies are well known in the art and are described, for example in Harlow et al. (In: Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, 1988, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).",
                        "When the antibody used in the methods used in the practice of the invention is a monoclonal antibody, the antibody is generated using any well known monoclonal antibody preparation procedures such as those described, for example, in Harlow et al. (supra) and in Tuszynski et al. (Blood 1988, 72:109-115). Generally, monoclonal antibodies directed against a desired antigen are generated from mice immunized with the antigen using standard procedures as referenced herein. Monoclonal antibodies directed against full length or fragments of target structure may be prepared using the techniques described in Harlow et al. (supra).",
                        "The effects of sensitization in the therapeutic use of animal-origin monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of human disease may be diminished by employing a hybrid molecule generated from the same Fab fragment, but a different Fc fragment, than contained in monoclonal antibodies previously administered to the same subject. It is contemplated that such hybrid molecules formed from the anti-target-structure monoclonal antibodies may be used in the present invention. The effects of sensitization are further diminished by preparing animal/human chimeric antibodies, e.g., mouse/human chimeric antibodies, or humanized (i.e. CDR-grafted) antibodies. Such monoclonal antibodies comprise a variable region, i.e., antigen binding region, and a constant region derived from different species. By \u2018chimeric\u2019 antibody is meant an antibody that comprises elements partly derived from one species and partly derived form at least one other species, e.g., a mouse/human chimeric antibody.",
                        "Chimeric animal-human monoclonal antibodies may be prepared by conventional recombinant DNA and gene transfection techniques well known in the art. The variable region genes of a mouse antibody-producing myeloma cell line of known antigen-binding specificity are joined with human immunoglobulin constant region genes. When such gene constructs are transfected into mouse myeloma cells, the antibodies produced are largely human but contain antigen-binding specificities generated in mice. As demonstrated by Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855, both chimeric heavy chain V region exon (VH)-human heavy chain C region genes and chimeric mouse light chain V region exon (VK)-human K light chain gene constructs may be expressed when transfected into mouse myeloma cell lines. When both chimeric heavy and light chain genes are transfected into the same myeloma cell, an intact H2L2 chimeric antibody is produced. The methodology for producing such chimeric antibodies by combining genomic clones of V and C region genes is described in the above-mentioned paper of Morrison et al., and by Boulianne et al. (Nature 1984, 312:642-646). Also see Tan et al. (J. Immunol. 1985, 135:3564-3567) for a description of high level expression from a human heavy chain promotor of a human-mouse chimeric K chain after transfection of mouse myeloma cells. As an alternative to combining genomic DNA, cDNA clones of the relevant V and C regions may be combined for production of chimeric antibodies, as described by Whitte et al. (Protein Eng. 1987, 1:499-505) and Liu et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1987, 84:3439-3443). For examples of the preparation of chimeric antibodies, see the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,292,867; 5,091,313; 5,204,244; 5,202,238; and 5,169,939. The entire disclosures of these patents, and the publications mentioned in the preceding paragraph, are incorporated herein by reference. Any of these recombinant techniques are available for production of rodent/human chimeric monoclonal antibodies against target structures.",
                        "To further reduce the immunogenicity of murine antibodies, \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies have been constructed in which only the minimum necessary parts of the mouse antibody, the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), are combined with human V region frameworks and human C regions (Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-525; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science 239:1534-1536; Hale et al., 1988, Lancet 2:1394-1399; Queen et al., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033). The entire disclosures of the aforementioned papers are incorporated herein by reference. This technique results in the reduction of the xenogeneic elements in the humanized antibody to a minimum. Rodent antigen binding sites are built directly into human antibodies by transplanting only the antigen binding site, rather than the entire variable domain, from a rodent antibody. This technique is available for production of chimeric rodent/human anti-target structure antibodies of reduced human immunogenicity.\u201d",

                        "Imaging techniques and diagnostic methods described herein, especially flow cytometry as described in greater detail herein, ss can use fluorescence-inducing compounds, e.g. a fluorescent moiety such as a fluorescein dye or a rhodamine dye. In some embodiments, the fluorescent moiety comprises two or more fluorescent dyes that can act cooperatively with one another, for example by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (\u201cFRET\u201d). The fluorescent moiety may be any fluorophore that is capable of producing a detectable fluorescence signal in an assay medium; the fluorescence signal can be \u201cself-quenched\u201d and capable of fluorescing in an aqueous medium. \u201cQuench\u201d refers to a reduction in the fluorescence intensity of a fluorescent group as measured at a specified wavelength, regardless of the mechanism by which the reduction is achieved. As specific examples, the quenching may be due to molecular collision, energy transfer such as FRET, a change in the fluorescence spectrum (color) of the fluorescent group or any other mechanism. The amount of the reduction is not critical and may vary over a broad range. The only requirement is that the reduction be measurable by the detection system being used. Thus, a fluorescence signal is \u201cquenched\u201d if its intensity at a specified wavelength is reduced by any measurable amount.",
                        "Examples of fluorophores include xanthenes such as fluoresceins, rhodamines and rhodols, cyanines, phtalocyanines, squairanines, bodipy dyes, pyrene, anthracene, naphthalene, acridine, stilbene, indole or benzindole, oxazole or benzoxazole, thiazole or benzothiazole, carbocyanine, carbostyryl, prophyrin, salicylate, anthranilate, azulene, perylene, pyridine, quinoline, borapolyazaindacene, xanthene, oxazine or benzoxazine, carbazine, phenalenone, coumarin, benzofuran, or benzphenalenone.

In addition, a reporter group containing heavy atoms is employed for detection using electron microscopy (EM or TEM), scanning EM (SEM) or mass spectral or equivalent techniques. In alternative embodiments, the reporter (domains or moieties) comprise functional groups that either turn off or on its reporting function from its native state, but in the presence of a biological sample (for example; pH change, presence of a specific enzyme, metal etc.) changes its state, giving further details to the biological environment in an autophagic vesicle.",
                        "Cell samples used in methods of the invention can be stem cells. Stem cells are cells capable of differentiation into other cell types, including those having a particular, specialized function (i.e., terminally differentiated cells, such as erythrocytes, macrophages, etc.), progenitor (i.e., \u201cmultipotent\u201d) cells which can give rise to any one of several different terminally differentiated cell types, and cells that are capable of giving rise to various progenitor cells. Cells that give rise to some or many, but not all, of the cell types of an organism are often termed \u201cpluripotent\u201d stem cells, which are able to differentiate into any cell type in the body of a mature organism, although without reprogramming they are unable to de-differentiate into the cells from which they were derived. \u201cMultipotent\u201d stem/progenitor cells (e.g., neural stem cells) have a more narrow differentiation potential than do pluripotent stem cells. Another class of cells even more primitive (i.e., uncommitted to a particular differentiation fate) than pluripotent stem cells are the so-called \u201ctotipotent\u201d stem cells (e.g., fertilized oocytes, cells of embryos at the two and four cell stages of development), which have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell of the particular species. For example, a single totipotent stem cell could give rise to a complete animal, as well as to any of the myriad of cell types found in the particular species (e.g., humans). In this specification, pluripotent and totipotent cells, as well as cells with the potential for differentiation into a complete organ or tissue, are referred as \u201cprimordial\u201d stem cells.",

                        "As disclosed herein, the invention enables the use of high-throughput format, high-content imaging to examine the cell sample for a nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway modulator effect on a cGMP and/or VLA-4-related cell morphology.",
                        "In one embodiment, determination of a nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway modulator effect on a cGMP and/or VLA-4-related cell morphology involves detecting the amount of cGMP and/or VLA-4, or the amount of cGMP and/or VLA-4 activity (e.g. cell adhesion), in a sample (e.g. a cell) both in the absence and presence of a candidate composition and an increase or a decrease in the amount of cGMP and/or VLA-4 activity (e.g. cell adhesion) as compared to control indicates that the candidate composition is a modulator of the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway effect on cGMP and/or VLA-4 in a cell extract, cell, tissue, organ, organism or individual. Fluorescence microscopy or a fluorescence imaging can be used to determine the amount of and/or the location of the detectable composition or moiety in a sample cell. The screening, e.g., high-throughput screening, method can comprise high-content imaging on a multi-well plate. The screening can be constructed and practiced on a multi-well plate. (Typically, wells are arranged in two-dimensional linear arrays on the multi-well platform. However, the wells can be provided in any type of array, such as geometric or non-geometric arrays. Commonly used numbers of wells include 24, 96, 384, 864, 1,536, 3,456, and 9,600.) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used to determine the amount of and/or the location of the detectable composition or moiety in the cell extract, cell, tissue, organ, organism or individual. This technique can be adapted to a plate-reader format for high-throughput screening of drugs that modulate autophagy, i.e., high-throughput detection of autophagic (autophagosome) levels and/or activity in cells or tissues. Compositions disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Document No. 20120042398 (e.g., cadaverine derivatives) can localize into or detect autophagosomes (AV) or AV subpopulations, and these compositions can comprise any detectable moiety or group, e.g., cadaverine derivative(s), or fluorescent-, bioluminescent, radioactive- and/or paramagnetic-conjugated cadaverine reagents.",

The antibodies can be detected by an immunoassay wherein an antibody-protein complex is formed. The antibodies are found in the sample of the subject, e.g. serum. The subject is a human and the implicated disease (e.g. multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, acute juvenile onset diabetes (Type 1), AIDS dementia, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, nephritis, retinitis, acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury, transplant rejection, or graft versus host disease) is idiopathic. Healthy individuals have minimal or low VLA-4 levels as defined by experimental protocol and as determined by conventional ELISA or Western blots. Individuals with a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder have significant amount of detectable VLA-4 auto-antibodies, at least 10% more anti-VLA-4 auto-antibodies detected over that from a healthy non-VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individual or the level obtained for a population of healthy non-a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individuals by conventional ELISA or Western blots as described herein. Moreover the levels of auto-antibodies correspond with the clinical features of the disease condition. Patients in remission after effective treatment have minimal or undetectable anti-VLA-4 auto-antibodies by conventional ELISA or Western blots. As an example, by undetectable amount of anti-VLA-4 auto-antibodies, it means that no visible band is observed in a Western Blot analysis, wherein human serum is diluted 1:100 and used in blot assays described herein. In one embodiment, the amount of anti-VLA-4 auto-antibodies in a healthy non-a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individual or the average amount in a population of healthy non-a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individuals as determined by conventional ELISA or Western blot can be considered as the background, reference or the control level. The collected samples of serum from the healthy non-a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individuals are diluted 1:100 and used in Western blot assays. The intensity of the visible band is quantified by densitometry. The densitometry intensity can be calibrated with a range of known titer of anti-VLA-4 antibodies reacting with a fixed amount of antigen VLA-4. For example, the range of known antibody titer can be 0 .mu.g/ml, 0.5 .mu.g/ml, 1.0 .mu.g/ml, 1.5 .mu.g/ml, 2.0 .mu.g/ml, 2.5 .mu.g/ml, 3.0 .mu.g/ml, 5 .mu.g/ml, 7.5 .mu.g/ml, 10 .mu.g/ml, and 15 .mu.g/ml and the fixed amount of VLA-4 can be 0.5 .mu.g on a blot. By comparing the densitometry intensity of a human sample with the calibration curve, it is possible to estimate the titer of the anti-VLA-4 in the sample. For the data collected for a population of individuals, the average value and one order of standard deviation is computed. Ideally, a population has about 25 healthy non-a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder individuals, preferably more. The statistics, the average value and one order of standard deviation can be uploaded to the computer system and data storage media. Patients having at least 10% more than this average amount of anti-VLA-4 auto-antibodies is likely to have a VLA-4-related cell adhesion disorder, especially if the patient is also presents the clinical significant features of the disease.

                                "Using fluorescent ligand binding to evaluate the integrin activation state on live cells in real-time, we showed that several small molecules, which specifically modulate nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway, as well as a cell permeable cGMP analog, can rapidly down-modulate binding of a VLA-4 specific ligand on cells pre-activated through three G\u03b1i-coupled receptors: wild type CXCR4, CXCR2 (IL-8RB), and a non-desensitizing mutant of formyl peptide receptor (FPR AST). Upon signaling, we detected rapid changes in the ligand dissociation rate. The dissociation rate after inside-out integrin de-activation was similar to the rate for resting cells. In a VLA-4/VCAM-1-specific myeloid cell adhesion system, inhibition of the VLA-4 affinity change by nitric oxide had a statistically significant effect on real-time cell aggregation.",
                                "We conclude that nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can rapidly down-modulate the affinity state of the VLA-4 binding pocket, especially under the condition of sustained G\u03b1i-coupled GPCR signaling, generated by a non-desensitizing receptor mutant. This suggests a fundamental role of this pathway in de-activation of integrin-dependent cell adhesion.",
                                "We found that the addition of a nitric oxide donor can rapidly induce dissociation of the VLA-4 specific ligand after cellular activation by any of three GPCRs (CXCR4, CXCR2, and FPR). The effect of nitric oxide was also mimicked by a NO-independent cGMP-cyclase activator, as well as a cell permeable analog of cGMP. This indicates that the integrin deactivation mechanism is intracellular, and suggests that deactivation is not related to direct s-nitrosylation. We also detected rapid changes in the dissociation rate constant (koff) of the VLA-4 specific ligand. As shown previously, modulation of the koff directly correlates with changes in the VLA-4 ligand binding affinity [14, 17]. Finally, using a VLA-4/VCAM-1 specific cell adhesion system, we showed that treatment of cells with a nitric oxide donor diminished GPCR activated cell adhesion to the level of un-stimulated (untreated) cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the NO/cGMP signaling pathway can actively down-regulate the affinity of the VLA-4 ligand binding pocket. This observation provides a molecular mechanism for the anti-adhesive activity of nitric oxide donors and drugs that modulate cGMP signaling pathway.",

Next, cGMP interacts with the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which phosphorylates multiple substrates, and participates in signal propagation. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs, not shown) can rapidly hydrolyze cGMP and terminate signal propagation. The NO/cGMP signaling pathway can be specifically targeted using small molecules. The nitric oxide donor provides an exogenous source of NO. The activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase binds to GC, and induces enzyme activation in the absence of NO. The cell permeable analog of cGMP diffuses across the plasma membrane, and thus, activates cGMP-dependent signaling.",

                                "The nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway has been described in mature leukocytes, platelets, and hematopoietic progenitors. It is composed of soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) that serves as an intracellular receptor for nitric oxide (FIG. 1). Upon binding to NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase, nitric oxide induces a conformational change resulting in the activation of the enzyme [36], and conversion of GTP to cGMP. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate binding leads to the subsequent activation of the cGMP dependent kinase PKG that phosphorylates multiple substrates, and participates in the regulation of platelet adhesion and aggregation [37].",
                                "To study the effects of nitric oxide/cGMP signaling in leukocytes, we selected three small molecules that specifically target this pathway (FIG. 1). Diethylamine NONOate can be described as a complex of diethylamine with nitric oxide. It is unstable in aqueous solution and used as nitric oxide donor [38]. BAY 41-2272 is an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which stimulates cGMP production through an NO-independent mechanism [39, 40]. N2,2\u2032-O-dibutyrylguanosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate is a cell permeable cGMP analog that activates protein kinase G [41]. These molecules are shown to stimulate the three initial consecutive steps of the pathway (FIG. 1), and therefore, can be used to mimic NO-dependent signaling.",

                                "**Nitric Oxide Donor Induces Rapid Decrease in the Binding of VLA-4 Specific Ligand**",
                                "Previously, we described and characterized in detail a model ligand an LDV-FITC containing small molecule ([14, 42-44], and references therein) for the detection of VLA-4 conformational regulation. This VLA-4 specific fluorescent probe was based on a highly specific \u03b14\u03b21-integrin inhibitor BIO1211, which contains the Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) ligand binding motif from the alternatively spliced connecting segment-1 (CS-1) peptide of cellular fibronectin [17, 45]. We established that integrin affinity changes, detected using this probe, vary in parallel with the natural VLA-4 ligand, human VCAM-1 [46]. For real-time detection of rapid integrin conformational changes, cells were treated with LDV-FITC (FIG. 2, first arrow), which was added after establishing a baseline for unstained cells, indicated on FIG. 2A as \u201cautofluorescence\u201d. Next, data were acquired for 2-3 minutes, and cells were activated with fMLFF (high affinity FPR ligand), CXCL12/SDF-1 (CXCR4 ligand), or CXCL8/IL-8 (CXCR2 ligand), for FPR, CXCR4, CXCR2 transfected cells, respectively (FIGS. 2A, B, and C). The concentration of the LDV-FITC probe used in the experiments (4 nM) was below the dissociation constant (Kd) for its binding to resting VLA-4 (low affinity state, Kd\u02dc12 nM), and above the Kd for physiologically activated VLA-4 (high affinity state, Kd\u02dc1-2 nM) [14]. Therefore, the transition from the low affinity to the high affinity receptor state led to increased binding of the probe (from \u02dc25% to \u02dc70-80% of receptor occupancy, as calculated based on the one site binding equation). The change in occupancy was detected as a rapid increase in the mean channel fluorescence (MCF). This signal increase was sustained for the case of a non-desensitizing mutant of FRP (FIG. 2A), and reversible for the wild-type receptors (CXCR4, and CXCR2, FIG. 2B,C). Next, cells were treated with the nitric oxide donor, or vehicle (control). Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously for up to 720-840 s. Addition of the nitric oxide donor resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent decrease in the binding of the VLA-4 specific ligand. In the absence of receptor desensitization, the effect of nitric oxide was more evident in cells transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR (vehicle, FIG. 2A) [47, 48]. However, the effect of the nitric oxide donor was statistically significant for both wild-type GPCRs. A faster and more pronounced signal decrease was detected (see black lines in FIG. 2B, 2C). To emphasize statistically the difference between control and experimental samples, standard errors of mean are indicated using error bars for every experimental point in FIG. 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E.",
                                "Next, we studied the effect of nitric oxide donor added prior to cell activation. DEA-NONOate was added at the 0 time point as indicated by the arrow (FIG. 2D, 2E). This resulted in a significant decrease in the magnitude of the response for both SDF-1 and IL-8 treated cells. Moreover, the effect of nitric oxide can be detected prior to cell activation. This suggests that at rest a small number of VLA-4 molecules exist in the activated conformation, and addition of nitric oxide donor deactivates these integrins. It worth noting that the nonspecific binding of the LDV-FITC probe remained identical for both control and treated samples (compare sample fluorescence after addition of LDV). Thus, the nitric oxide donor rapidly decreased binding of the VLA-4 specific fluorescent ligand after cell activation through three G\u03b1i-coupled GPCRs. Pretreatment with the nitric oxide donor significantly diminished the magnitude of the response.",

                                "To confirm that the effect of nitric oxide can be mimicked using a nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, we repeated the experiments shown in FIG. 2A using BAY 41-2272 (FIG. 3A). Cells, transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR, were sequentially treated with LDV-FITC (4 nM), fMLFF, vehicle, or indicated concentrations of the soluble guanylyl cyclase activator. We observed a significant decrease in LDV-FITC binding, comparable to the effect induced by the nitric oxide donor (FIG. 2A). However, the decrease in LDV-FITC binding was partially reversible. This phenomenon can be rationalized, in terms of the proposed feedback loops that regulate cGMP production. Intracellular cGMP can directly stimulate the catalytic activity of several cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that hydrolyze cGMP [49-51]. Another possibility is activation of PDEs through phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (FIG. 1) [50-53].",

This resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the response for both SDF-1 and IL-8 treated cells in a manner comparable to the effect of nitric oxide donor. Similarly, the effect of activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase can be detected prior to cell activation. Thus, the nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase induces a dose-dependent decrease in binding of the VLA-4 specific ligand, and pretreatment with the activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase significantly diminished the magnitude of the response after activation.",

This implies that the ligand association rate constant is essentially independent of receptor conformation (for example see Table I in [17]), or Table I in [14]). Therefore, the dissociation rate analysis can be used to assess the affinity state of the VLA-4 integrin binding pocket.",
                                "To saturate the majority of low affinity sites, cells transfected with a non-desensitizing mutant of FPR were preincubated with a higher concentration of the VLA-4 specific ligand (25 nM). Since the Kd for the low affinity state is \u02dc12 nM (Table I in [14]), at 25 nM\u02dc70% of sites are occupied before activation. Next, an excess of the unlabeled LDV competitor (labeled on FIG. 3D as \u201cLDV block\u201d) is added to induce dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe. After activation by fMLFF, because of the rapid affinity change, little additional binding of the probe was seen (FIG. 3D, green and red lines). Addition of the nitric oxide-independent activator of the soluble guanylyl cyclase returned the binding of the probe to a level similar to the binding before fMLFF addition.",
                                "Next, the regions of the ligand-binding curves corresponding to the dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe were fitted to a single exponential decay equation. The resulting dissociation rate constants (koff, s\u22121) are shown graphically in FIG. 3E. At rest, the majority of the VLA-4 molecules exhibit rapid probe dissociation, corresponding to the low affinity state of the ligand binding pocket (FIG. 3D, 3E, blue curve \u201cLDV-FITC, LDV block\u201d, koff\u02dc0.04\u00b10.001 s\u22121). After cell activation by fMLFF, the dissociation rate was significantly slower (FIG. 3 D, 3E, red curve \u201cLDV-FITC, fMLFF, LDV block\u201d, koff\u02dc0.018\u00b10.0001 s\u22121). The slower koff corresponds to higher ligand binding affinity [14, 17, 46]. After the addition of the nitric oxide-independent activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, dissociation rates were comparable to the rate for the resting state (FIG. 3 D, 3E, green curve \u201cLDV-FITC, fMLFF, BAY 41-2272, LDV block\u201d, koff\u02dc0.036\u00b10.0007 s\u22121). This suggests that activation of guanylyl cyclase can actively down-regulate the affinity state of the VLA-4 integrin ligand binding pocket, even under the condition with the continuously signaling non-desensitizing GPCR mutant. The affinity state induced by guanylyl cyclase activator was quantitatively similar to the resting state before activation. The resting VLA-4 conformation on U937 cells exhibits the lowest physiological affinity. It is worth noting, that this result is comparable to the effect of Gas-coupled GPCRs on VLA-4 conformation (compare FIG. 3D in the current manuscript and FIG. 2C, 2D in [21]). This result is especially interesting in light of the structural relationship of the two second messengers cAMP and cGMP, originating from these signaling pathways.",

                                "A current paradigm of the inside-out activation of integrins implies an instantaneous triggering of integrin conformational changes, where a chemokine signal appears to be closely opposed to the integrin [56]. An \u201cupdated\u201d adhesion cascade includes several steps in addition to the traditional tethering, rolling, and arrest [57]. While integrin adhesion research is largely focused on activating pathways, the inhibitory Gas-coupled GPCR/cAMP-dependent signaling pathways is acknowledged for platelet regulation [58]. The relative lack of interest in the integrin deactivation pathways is potentially compensated by the identification of antagonists that competitively block adhesive interactions, and thus, provide a desirable therapeutic effect [59].",
                                "However, it is arguable that deactivation of the signaling pathway is as appealing as a direct blockade of the activating signaling using receptor antagonists. It was established, that in order to induce a half-optimal elevation of the signal in leukocytes, only a very small fraction of occupied cellular receptors is required. In some cases, this fraction may be less than 0.1% of the total number of receptors [60]. This is dependent on significant signal amplification for both stimulatory and inhibitory pathways [61]. Therefore, from a therapeutic point of view, it would be very difficult to completely block the occupancy of activating chemokine receptors using receptor-specific antagonists. A small fraction of activating receptors occupied by the ligand, may be sufficient to trigger the adhesion signal. A plausible scenario would be to take advantage of natural regulatory pathways to counteract unwanted signaling, especially because antagonistic pathways potentially have similar amplification capacity [60, 61].",
                                "**NO-Dependent VLA-4 Deactivation and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization**",
                                "The VLA-4 integrin is critical for the interaction of hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells [2,3]. Blocking of the VLA-4/VCAM-1 interaction using anti-VLA-4 antibodies, small molecule competitive as well as allosteric VLA-4 antagonists, results in the mobilization of progenitors into the peripheral blood [28-32, 62]. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), one of the major enzymes, producing nitric oxide in the vasculature, is essential for the mobilization of stem and progenitor cells from the bone marrow stem cell niche. Mice lacking eNOS showed a defect in progenitor mobilization [26]. Nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide regulates the bone marrow environment, and is envisioned as a direct mediator of cell mobilization [27]. Our current finding that nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway can actively down-regulate VLA-4 affinity, even under conditions of constant signaling, induced by a non-desensitizing mutant of GPCR, indicates that VLA-4 conformational deactivation provides a plausible explanation for the molecular basics of nitric oxide signaling-induced progenitor mobilization."

This conformational change results in a significant down-regulation of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion, suggesting a major role of this pathway in the regulation of inside-out integrin de-activation and cell de-adhesion (mobilization)."

For transfection of B78H1 cells, full-length human VCAM-1 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Roy Lobb of Biogen Inc. The original construct [74] was subcloned into the pTRACER vector (Invitrogen). Transfection into B78H1 was done using the LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen). High expressors were selected using the MoFlo Flow Cytometer (DakoCytomation). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2 mm 1-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) and then harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (110 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% human serum albumin and stored on ice. The buffer was depleted of lipopolysaccharide by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B sepharose (Detoxigel; Pierce Scientific). Cells were counted using the Coulter Multisizer/Z2 analyzer (Beckman Coulter). For experiments, cells were suspended in the same HEPES buffer at 1\u00d7106 cells/ml and warmed to 37\u00b0 C.

                                "Kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation of the LDV-FITC probe was described previously [14, 46]. Briefly, cells (1\u00d7106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% HSA or RPMI under different incubating conditions for 10-20 min at 37\u00b0 C. Flow cytometric data were acquired for up to 1024 s at 37\u00b0 C. while the samples were stirred continuously at 300 rpm with a 5\u00d72 mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products). For real-time affinity activation experiments, 4 nM LDV-FITC was added after establishing a baseline for unstained cells marked on figures as \u201cautofluorescence\u201d. Next, different ligands were added and acquisition was re-established, creating a 5-10 s gap in the time course. For activation, cells were treated with different GPCR ligands at saturating concentration (10 times or higher than Kd). In several experiments cells were treated sequentially with two different compounds. Acquisition was re-established, and data were acquired continuously for up to 1024 s. The concentration of the LDV-FITC probe used in the experiments (4 nM) was below the dissociation constant (Kd) for its binding to resting VLA-4 (low affinity state, Kd\u02dc12 nM), and above the Kd for physiologically activated VLA-4 (high affinity state, Kd\u02dc1-2 nM) [14]. Therefore, the transition from the low affinity to the high affinity receptor state led to increased binding of the probe (from \u02dc25% to \u02dc70-80% of receptor occupancy, as calculated based on the one site binding equation), which was detected as an increase in the mean channel fluorescence (MCF). For kinetic dissociation measurements, cell samples were preincubated with the fluorescent probe (25 nM), treated with excess unlabeled LDV containing small molecule (2 \u03bcM) and the dissociation of the fluorescent molecule was followed. The resulting data were converted to MCF versus time using FCSQuery software developed by Dr. Bruce Edwards (University of New Mexico)."

Briefly, U937/AST FPR stably transfected cells were labeled with red fluorescent PKH26GL dye, and B78H1/VCAM-1 transfectants were stained with green fluorescent PKH67GL dye (Sigma-Aldrich). Labeled cells were washed, resuspended in HEPES buffer supplemented with 0.1% HSA and stored on ice until used in assays. Control U937 cells were preincubated with the 1 \u03bcM LDV-containing small molecule for blocking adhesion. Prior to data acquisition, cells were warmed to 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min separately and then mixed. During data acquisition, the samples were stirred with a 5\u00d72-mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, N.J.) at 300 rpm and kept at 37\u00b0 C. For stimulation, cells were treated with appropriate GPCR ligands at saturating concentration (10 times or higher than Kd). In several experiments cells were treated sequentially with two different compounds. The number of cell aggregates containing U937 adherent to B78H1/VCAM-1 (red and green cofluorescent particles) as well as the number of singlets (red or green fluorescent particles, FL2 and FL1 in FACScan flow cytometer) were followed in real-time. The percentage of aggregates was calculated as follows: % U937 cells in aggregates=number of aggregates/(number of aggregates+number of U937 singlets))\u00d7100. Experiments were done using a FACScan flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, Calif.). The data were converted to number of singlets/aggregates versus time using FCSQuery software developed by Dr. Bruce Edwards (University of New Mexico)."
