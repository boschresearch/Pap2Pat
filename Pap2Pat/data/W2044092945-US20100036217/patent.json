    "date": "2007-07-11 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "The present invention relates, in general, to a system for analyzing tissue perfusion using the concentration of indocyanine green and a method of measuring the perfusion rate using the system and, more particularly, to a system for measuring tissue perfusion by injecting indocyanine green into a living body, detecting variation in the concentration of indocyanine green with the passage of time, and analyzing the detected variation, and a method of measuring the perfusion rate using the system. The present invention provides a method of measuring perfusion in a living body, which enables accurate measurement for respective regions in a wide range from a perfusion rate decreased to less than 10% of normal perfusion to a perfusion rate increased to greater than normal perfusion using the above-described mechanism of ICG in a living body, which cannot be conducted using the conventional technology.",

                        "The conventional tissue perfusion measuring method \u2018laser Doppler imaging\u2019 is a method of measuring the degree of scattering of laser light depending on the speed of blood flow in a skin surface, but has a shortcoming in that it is unsuitable for a method of measuring variation in the state in which blood flow is low because sensitivity is low when blood flow rate decreases to less than 20% of the normal of the blood flow rate.",
                        "Another conventional blood vessel imaging method \u2018X-ray blood vessel imaging (X-ray angiography)\u2019 shows X-ray images using a blood vessel contrast agent. However, it is a structural imaging technique that shows the configuration of the internal diameters of blood vessels, rather than the actual flow of blood (Helisch, A., Wagner, S., Khan, N., Drinane, M., Wolfram, S., Heil, M., Ziegelhoeffer, T., Brandt, U., Pearlman, J. D., Swartz, H. M. & Schaper, W. (2006) Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 26: 520-526). Accordingly, it is currently impossible to clinically measure the precise rate of tissue perfusion using this method.",
                        "The safety of a conventional blood vessel imaging method using indocyanine green (ICG angiography) has already been verified (Sekimoto, M., Fukui, M. & Fujita, K. (1997) Anaesthesia 52: 1166-1172), and the method has been clinically used for the detection of the formation of blood vessels in grafted skin (Holm, C., Mayr, M., Hofter, E., Becker, A., Pfeiffer, U. J. & Muhlbauer, W. (2002) Br. J. Plast. Surg. 55: 635-644) and the measurement of newly created blood vessels in a diabetic patient's eyeballs (Costa, R. A., Calucci, D., Teixeira, L. F., Cardillo, J. A. & Bonomo, P. P. (2003) Am. J. Opthalmol. 135: 857-866). ICG receives near infrared rays, having wavelengths ranging from 750-790 nm, and radiates near infrared rays, having longer wavelengths ranging from 800 to 850 nm, and the radiated near infrared rays can be measured using a CCD camera or a spectrometer. Near infrared rays have high penetration power, and thus they can penetrate several centimeters deep into tissue and don't scatter much, with the result that they are the object of extensive research towards human body imaging technology (Morgan, N. Y., English, S., Chen, W., Chernomordik, V., Russo, A., Smith, P. D. & Gandjbakhche, A. (2005) Acad. Radiol. 12: 313-323). This method is also used as a technique for structural blood vessel imaging. This method is used for the test of the permeability of newly created blood vessels in a diabetic patient's eyeballs, not for the measurement of tissue perfusion.",
                        "The above method is used for an \u2018ICG elimination test\u2019 as well as the above purpose. When ICG is injected into a vein, ICG is attached to protein in a blood vessel, such as albumin, and is rapidly spread into the body via blood vessels. When it is transferred to the liver, it is separated from protein and discharged in the form of bile and excreted from the body finally while the protein is degraded. As a result, the concentration of ICG is rapidly reduced in the blood vessels, so that the intensity of ICG fluorescence signals is reduced to half of the intensity of initial ICG fluorescence signals 4 to 6 minutes later, and is then diminished and deviates from an accurate measurement range. One use of the \u2018ICG dynamics\u2019, in which ICG is rapidly eliminated by the liver, is a liver function test (Sinyoung Kim, et al., (2003) Kor. J. Lab. Med., 23: 88-91), but the ICG dynamics has been known to have shortcomings when applied to in vivo imaging (Sekimoto, M., Fukui, M. & Fujita, K. (1997) Anaesthesia 52: 1166-1172).Accordingly, the present inventors have completed the present invention through the ascertainment of the fact that accurate measurement can be conducted in a wide range from a perfusion rate decreased to less than 10% of that of normal perfusion to a perfusion rate increased to greater than that of normal perfusion using the ICG dynamics in the living body."

                        "In the measurement method, with regard to the light source, an LED having a wavelength of 770+/\u221220 nm, a light source in which a filter having a wavelength of 770+/\u221220 nm is attached to a white light source, and a laser light source, having a wavelength of 770+/\u221220 nm, may all be used as a light source radiating light for detecting ICG fluorescence. Any device using the above-described photo-detection device may be used as the photodetector. Although the photodetector is not limited, the photodetector must detect near infrared rays having wavelengths ranging from 800 to 850 nm, which are ICG fluorescence signals, and an infrared detection camera or a spectrometer may be used as the photodetector. The photodetector sequentially detects images immediately after an injection of ICG, and transmits signals, capable of exhibiting an ICG dynamics with the passage of time, to the analysis apparatus.",

                        "Although the acquisition of Tmax at the step of calculating perfusion rates from the dynamics of ICG fluorescence intensity of the target tissue (ischemic tissue) does not limit the method of analyzing the perfusion rates, it is preferable to perform calculation using the principle in which the time Tmax, at which the differential value of the intensity of fluorescence is 0, is proportional to the perfusion rate in the target tissue.",
                        "The step 3 may be embodied by the following steps: acquiring perfusion rates of region of interest (ROI) according to (a) average data of pixels of particular regions, (b) respective pixels, or (c) respective ROIs representing perfusion rates; and representing the perfusion rates using a perfusion map by illustrating the perfusion rates for the ROI with corresponding colors designated according to the perfusion rates. The above process may be performed by calculations using software having an appropriate algorithm and loaded on a microprocessor and a display through an output device of a computer. FIG. 7 shows an example of the perfusion map, which may be acquired by sequentially obtaining fluorescence images with the passage of time after injecting ICG, measuring the perfusion rates through the analysis of the ICG fluorescence dynamics of respective pixels, and painting the pixels with colors corresponding to the measured perfusion rates. An example of matching between the perfusion rates and colors is illustrated in FIG. 10.",

Since the rate of tissue necrosis was greatly affected by the rate of tissue perfusion, whether the \u2018precise perfusion rates\u2019 were measured was evaluated through the observation of rates of tissue necrosis. As a result, as shown in FIG. 8, the method of the present invention showed the significant relationship between measured perfusion values and the rates of tissue necrosis. This indicates that measurement can be performed in the case where the perfusion rate is decreased to 0.04\u02dc50%/min (the perfusion rate of a normal leg: 300%/min), unlike the measurement using Doppler imaging (refer to FIG. 1), that is, a comparative example, in which a subtle difference in the considerably decreased \u2018perfusion rate\u2019 could not be measured."

                                "The present inventors constructed a blood perfusion reduction model to obtain ICG images in an actual ischemic tissue. A surgical operation of removing an artery and vein from one leg of each of 50 nude mice (Charlse liver Japan, Inc.) was carried out, ICG images were acquired using the measurement apparatus of FIG. 2 four hours after the surgical operation, and the perfusion rates of tissues were obtained using the above-described method.",
                                "The obtained perfusion rates of tissues were arranged in a perfusion map (the left side of FIG. 8). In FIG. 8, a perfusion rate of 300%/min corresponds to 9 in the perfusion map, 0%/min corresponds to 0.",
                                "Since the rate of tissue necrosis is considerably affected by the rate of tissue perfusion, whether a \u2018perfusion rate\u2019 has been precisely measured can be evaluated through the observation of the rate of tissue necrosis. The rates of tissue necrosis of 50 laboratory mice were observed seven days after operations (the right side of FIG. 8), and the relationship between perfusion rates and the rates of tissue necrosis, which were obtained four hours after the operations, was statistically analyzed using the statistical data. As a result of the analysis, it was ascertained that the probability of tissue necrosis corresponding to a perfusion rate of 50%/min fell within a range of 0\u02dc10%, and the probability of tissue necrosis corresponding to a perfusion rate ranging from 15 to 20%/min fell within a range of 75 to 80%. The present inventors assigned a red color to the case where the probability of tissue necrosis was 1 and a blue color to the case where the probability of tissue necrosis was 0, and constructs a necrosis probability map for the tissue using a color gradient between the cases (the center of FIG. 8). The result, in which the constructed tissue necrosis probability map corresponded to the actual rates of tissue necrosis, was acquired.",
                                "The result exhibited the fact that the probability of necrosis of tissue increased as the perfusion rate measured using the method decreased, and thus verified the precision of \u2018perfusion rates\u2019 acquired using the method. This means that it was impossible to measure a subtle difference in considerably decreased \u2018perfusion rate\u2019 using the conventional technology, as shown in FIG. 1, but it is possible to perform measurement using the method of the present invention in the case where the perfusion rate is decreased to 0.04-50%/min (the perfusion rate of a normal leg: 300%/min). This coincides with the rate of tissue necrosis, which means that the method of the present invention has an ability to predict the rate of tissue necrosis."
