    "title": "N-Terminal T4 Lysozyme Fusion Facilitates Crystallization of a G Protein Coupled Receptor",
    "date": "2012-10-04",
    "abstract": "A highly crystallizable T4 lysozyme (T4L) was fused to the N-terminus of the \u03b2(2) adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for catecholamines. We demonstrate that the N-terminal fused T4L is sufficiently rigid relative to the receptor to facilitate crystallogenesis without thermostabilizing mutations or the use of a stabilizing antibody, G protein, or protein fused to the 3rd intracellular loop. This approach adds to the protein engineering strategies that enable crystallographic studies of GPCRs alone or in complex with a signaling partner.",

                "Obtaining well-diffracting crystals of G-protein coupled receptors remains one of the most challenging obstacles for structural studies of this important family of signaling proteins. Only a limited number of GPCR structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography. A factor contributing to the difficulty in obtaining GPCR crystals is the relatively small amount of polar surface area available for forming crystal lattice contacts.",
                "We previously developed two strategies to address this problem. First, a stabilizing antibody was used to facilitate the crystallization of human beta2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) [1], and more recently to stabilize and crystallize the active state of the \u03b22AR [2]. These antibodies bind and stabilize the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane segments (TM) 5 and 6, and provide a structured hydrophilic surface for crystal packing interactions. In the second approach, T4 lysozyme (T4L) was fused to the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6, replacing the unstructured intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) [3]. The fused T4L formed packing interactions in the crystal lattice and resulted 2.4 \u00c5 crystal structure. Importantly, the TM5-T4L-TM6 fusion approach has been effective for at least seven other GPCRs [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].",
                "Although both of the strategies have been effective for crystallizing isolated GPCRs, neither can be used to facilitate crystallization of signaling complexes such as GPCR-G protein and GPCR-arrestin complexes, where the antibody or the fused T4L would interfere with complex formation. We therefore explored the use of T4L insertions on the extracellular surface of the \u03b22AR. The extracellular loops of the \u03b22AR and other GPCRs do not tolerate large insertions or deletions. In contrast, the amino terminus of the \u03b22AR can be deleted without loss of function. We therefore chose to replace the N terminus of the \u03b22AR with T4 lysozyme (T4L-GPCR fusion)."

                        "To have a T4L-\u03b22AR fusion protein suitable for crystallization, the link between T4L and the receptor must be short and relatively rigid, yet not interfere with receptor function. Several different fusion proteins were generated and examined for expression levels and binding properties (Fig. 1). In an effort to generate a rigid interaction between T4L and the \u03b22AR, we removed the relatively flexible C-terminus of the T4L and attempted to fuse the remaining C terminal helix of T4L with the extracellular end of TM1 of the \u03b22AR. None of these constructs gave sufficient amounts of functional receptor.",
                        "In a second approach, we fused the carboxyl terminus of T4L to D29, the first amino acid of the extracellular helical extension of TM1. Four constructs were generated and examined: direct fusion of T4L to D29, and the inclusion of 1\u20133 Ala residues between T4L and the \u03b22AR (Fig. 1). The highest level of expression was obtained from the fusion with a two-Ala linker. The fusion protein had normal pharmacology and G protein coupling. To improve expression, two additional point mutations M96T and M98T were made in the \u03b22AR component of the fusion protein. We have previously observed that mutation of these residues, which are located in the first extracellular loop and face away from the protein, had no effect on receptor function, but enhanced expression by up to two-fold. We were able to produce 1.5mg of pure, functional protein from 1 liter of Sf9 cells (Expression Systems, Woodland, CA)."

                        "The above version of T4L-\u03b22AR was recently used to obtain the crystal structure of the \u03b22AR-Gs complex [11]. However, in this structure most of the lattice contacts in this crystal are mediated by Gs, and the N terminal fused T4L does not interact with the extracellular surface of its fused \u03b22AR (Fig. 2). The lack of interactions between T4L and the extracellular surface of the \u03b22AR in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex suggested that T4L fused to the N terminus of the \u03b22AR might not be sufficiently constrained to facilitate crystallogenesis in the absence of the cytoplasmic G protein. We therefore sought to determine if the amino terminal T4L could facilitate crystallogenesis in the absence of a soluble protein bound or fused to the third intracellular loop. Additional modifications were made to minimize unstructured sequence in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). We truncated the C-terminal residues after amino acid 365. The 3rd intracellular loop (ICL3) of \u03b22AR is another flexible region and it is subject to proteolysis [1]. This loop was truncated in the fusion protein by removing residues 235 to 263. The final construct T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 is illustrated in Figure 1.",
                        "To determine the functional integrity of T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, we determined agonist and antagonist binding affinities. The ligand binding pocket is formed by amino acids from four transmembrane domains and is therefore very sensitive to any perturbation of the receptor structure. T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 exhibits ligand binding affinities for the antagonist [3H]-Dihydroalprenolol and the agonist isopreterenol that are comparable to those of the wild type receptor (Fig. 3). T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 also maintains the ability to couple to the G-protein Gs (Fig. 3C). The inhibition of basal GTP\u03b3S binding by the inverse agonist ICI-118551 is slightly greater for T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 than for the wild-type \u03b22AR. This observation suggests that the modifications used in constructing T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 might lead to constitutive activity; however, the observed difference is not statistically significant and T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 does not exhibit higher affinity for agonists (Fig. 3B), a property often associated with constitutive activity in GPCRs.",
                        "Purified T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 bound to the inverse agonist carazolol crystallized as small rods in lipid cubic phase (37% PEG300 (v/v), 0.1M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 0.1 M ammonium phosphate). Crystals diffracted to a resolution of 3.3 \u00c5; however, due to radiation damage, our dataset was limited to 4.0 (Table 1). Nevertheless, the dataset allowed us to solve the structure by molecular replacement. The interaction between the \u03b22AR and T4L is sufficiently rigid to detect electron density for the 2 Ala link between these two proteins (Fig. 4). This link was not detectable in the electron density map of the \u03b22AR-Gs structure [11] (Fig. 2). In the T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 crystal lattice, the packing interactions are primarily mediated by T4L and there are no contacts between adjacent receptors (Fig. 5), indicating the important role of the T4L in facilitating GPCR crystallization. Each T4L has four packing interactions: 1- against ECL1 and ECL2 of its fused \u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, 2- against T4L of one adjacent T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, 3- against T4L, ECL2 and ECL3 of a second T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, and 4- against ICL3 and Helix 8 of a third T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 (Fig. 5)."

The structures have similar solvent accessible surface areas: 25,000 \u00c52 for \u03b22AR-T4L and 24000 \u00c52 for T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3. The slightly lower value for T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 is due to more extensive packing interactions between T4L and the receptor. Only minor differences can be observed in these two structures, presumably due to different crystal packing patterns. The similarity of the structures determined independently through different strategies further validates the fusion protein approach, demonstrating that structural distortions due to protein engineering or crystal packing are unlikely.",
                        "Of interest, ICL2 in the two inactive structures of \u03b22AR-Fab5 and \u03b22AR-T4L is in an extended loop while it is an alpha helix in both active structures: the \u03b22AR-Gs complex [11] and the \u03b22AR stabilized by Nb80 [2]. In both of the inactive structures (\u03b22AR-Fab5 and \u03b22AR-T4L), ICL2 participates in lattice contacts that may influence its conformation. However, in the T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 structure ICL2 is not involved in packing interactions, yet is an extended loop that is nearly identical to that observed in the other inactive state \u03b22AR structures (Fig. 6). Thus, this extended loop structure may reflect an inactive state."

                "The majority part of a G-protein coupled receptor is surrounded by lipids or detergents, allowing very limited hydrophilic surface for crystal packing contacts. It has been shown that increasing the hydrophilic surface at the cytoplasmic side of the receptor can facilitate GPCR crystallization. However, insertion of T4L or binding of an antibody to ICL3 prevents GPCRs from forming signaling complexes with cytosolic protein partners. As an alternative strategy, we used an amino terminal T4L fusion to increase the extracellular hydrophilic surface available for forming crystal lattice contacts.",
                "Our initial efforts to generate antibodies that recognize the extracellular surface of the \u03b22AR were not successful. However, even if they were successful, these antibodies could not be used for other GPCRs. In contrast, the N-T4L fusion strategy may be more broadly applicable to other GPCRs and other membrane proteins. Our results demonstrate that the signal peptide used was sufficient to facilitate translocation of T4L domain across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, ensuring proper orientation of TM1. Although it may compromise the rigidity of the fusion protein, a relatively flexible linker may be necessary to allow the receptor and the T4L to fold correctly. The optimal length of the linker between T4L and the amino terminus may differ for different GPCRs.",
                "Compared with our previous strategies that utilized T4L or an antibody at the cytoplasmic surface, the N-terminal T4L fusion strategy allows for interactions between the \u03b22AR and signaling and regulatory proteins as demonstrated by the recent \u03b22AR-Gs complex structure. This approach also offers a protein engineering alternative for GPCRs and other membrane proteins that do not tolerate insertion of T4L or other hydrophilic proteins in cytoplasmic loops.",
                "In conclusion, fusion of T4L to the amino terminus of a GPCR can facilitate crystallogenesis. This approach can also facilitate the formation of crystals of a GPCR in complex with a cytoplasmic signaling protein."

T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 bound with carazolol was then eluted from M1 resin with HHS buffer supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, 200 \u00b5g/ml free FLAG peptide and saturating concentration of CHS (prepared as described above). The FLAG epitope tag of T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 was removed by the treatment of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Invitrogen) for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C. The untagged T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3-cazazolol complex was then further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using an S200 column (GE healthcare) equilibrated in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.1% DDM and 1 nM carazolol. The same buffer was used as the running buffer for SEC. The purity of the final T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394ICL3 is better than 90%, as assessed by SDS-PAGE."

The complex was crystallized using the lipid cubic phase (LCP) method as previously described [8]. The protein complex was mixed with lipid moloolein with a 1\u22361.5 mass ratio at room temperature. 0.03 \u00b5l of the protein-lipid mixture drop was deposited in each well of a 96-well glass sandwich plate (Molecular Dimensions). The drop was then overlaid with 0.65 \u00b5l of precipitant and the well was sealed by glass coverslip. By using this method, the T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3-carazolol complex was crystallized in 37% PEG300 (v/v), 0.1 M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 0.1 M ammonium phosphate after 2 days of incubation in 20\u00b0C."

                        "Crystals were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen directly without using additional cryo-protectant. Diffraction data from 15 different crystals were measured using the GM/CA-CAT minibeam at 23-ID-D, Advance Photon Source, Argonne National Labs. The data were processed with HKL2000 [15] and the structure solved by molecular replacement using Molrep. Further model rebuilding was performed by using Coot [16] and the structure was refined with Phenix [17]. The validation of the final structural model was performed using Molprobity [18]. Data processing and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. The root mean square deviaion value of 0.32 was calculated using pymol. The cutoff value is 3 and 268 out of 282 C\u03b1 atoms of the two structures (4GBR and 2RH1) were included in the structural alignment. Solvent accessible surface area calculation was also performed using Pymol."
