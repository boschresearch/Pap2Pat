                        "G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling plays a vital role in a number of physiological contexts including, but not limited to, metabolism, inflammation, neuronal function, and cardiovascular function. For instance, GPCRs include receptors for biogenic amines, e.g., dopamine, epinephrine, histamine, glutamate, acetylcholine, and serotonin; for purines such as ADP and ATP; for the vitamin niacin; for lipid mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins, lipoxins, platelet activating factor, and leukotrienes; for peptide hormones such as calcitonin, follicle stimulating hormone, gonadotropin releasing hormone, ghrelin, motilin, neurokinin, and oxytocin; for non-hormone peptides such as beta-endorphin, dynorphin A, Leu-enkephalin, and Met-enkephalin; for the non-peptide hormone melatonin; for polypeptides such as C5a anaphylatoxin and chemokines; for proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, and factor Xa; and for sensory signal mediators, e.g., retinal photopigments and olfactory stimulatory molecules. GPCRs are of immense interest for drug development."

                        "\u201cG-protein coupled receptors\u201d, or \u201cGPCRs\u201d are polypeptides that share a common structural motif, having seven regions of between 22 to 24 hydrophobic amino acids that form seven alpha helices, each of which spans a membrane. As illustrated in FIG. 1, each span is identified by number, i.e., transmembrane-1 (TM1), transmembrane-2 (TM2), etc. The transmembrane helices are joined by regions of amino acids between transmembrane-2 and transmembrane-3, transmembrane-4 and transmembrane-5, and transmembrane-6 and transmembrane-7 on the exterior, or \u201cextracellular\u201d side, of the cell membrane, referred to as \u201cextracellular\u201d regions 1, 2 and 3 (EC1, EC2 and EC3), respectively. The transmembrane helices are also joined by regions of amino acids between transmembrane-1 and transmembrane-2, transmembrane-3 and transmembrane-4, and transmembrane-5 and transmembrane-6 on the interior, or \u201cintracellular\u201d side, of the cell membrane, referred to as \u201cintracellular\u201d regions 1, 2 and 3 (IC1, IC2 and IC3), respectively. The \u201ccarboxy\u201d (\u201cC\u201d) terminus of the receptor lies in the intracellular space within the cell, and the \u201camino\u201d (\u201cN\u201d) terminus of the receptor lies in the extracellular space outside of the cell. GPCR structure and classification is generally well known in the art, and further discussion of GPCRs may be found in Probst, DNA Cell Biol. 1992 11:1-20; Marchese et al Genomics 23: 609-618, 1994; and the following books: J\u00fcrgen Wess (Ed) Structure-Function Analysis of G Protein-Coupled Receptors published by Wiley-Liss (1st edition; Oct. 15, 1999); Kevin R.

Such GPCRs are found in nature. The term \u201cnon-naturally occurring\u201d in reference to a GPCR means a GPCR that is not naturally-occurring. Wild-type GPCRs that have been made constitutively active through mutation, and variants of naturally-occurring GPCRs, e.g., epitope-tagged GPCR and GPCRs lacking their native N-terminus are examples of non-naturally occurring GPCRs.

The boundaries of the coding sequence are typically determined by a start codon at the 5\u2032 (amino) terminus and a translation stop codon at the 3\u2032 (carboxy) terminus. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited to, cDNA from viral, prokaryotic or eukaryotic mRNA, genomic DNA sequences from viral or prokaryotic DNA, and synthetic DNA sequences. A transcription termination sequence may be located 3\u2032 to the coding sequence. Other \u201ccontrol elements\u201d may also be associated with a coding sequence.

In particular embodiments, the protein is characterized in that is crystallizable under lipidic cubic phase crystallization conditions, although other crystallization conditions may be employed. A polar surface for crystal lattice contacts on the extracellular surface of the protein provides several options for crystallizing the fusion protein.

In certain cases, a autonomously folding stable domain does not contain a flexible linker (e.g., a flexible polyglycine linker) or other such conformationally unrestrained regions. In certain cases, the autonomously folding stable domain contains a sequence of amino acids from a protein that has a crystal structure that has been solved. In certain cases, the stable, folded protein insertion should not have highly flexible loop region characterized by high cyrstallographic temperature factors (i.e., high B-factors).",

Anal Biochem 1995 231, 269-271; see FIG. 16 for purification overview). A \u03b22AR construct truncated after residue 365 (\u03b22AR-365) was used for the majority of the analytical experiments and for deuterium exchange experiments. M1 Flag affinity chromatography (Sigma) served as the initial purification step followed by alprenolol-Sepharose chromatography for selection of functional receptor. A subsequent M1 Flag affinity chromatography step was used to exchange receptor-bound alprenolol for high-affinity agonist BI-167107. The agonist-bound receptor was eluted, dialyzed against buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM and 10 BI-167107), treated with lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and concentrated to approximately 50 mg ml\u22121 with a 50 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWCO) Millipore concentrator. Prior to spin concentration, the \u03b22AR-365 construct, but not T4L-\u03b22AR, was treated with PNGaseF (New England Biolabs) to remove amino-terminal N-linked glycosylation. The purified receptor was routinely analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie brilliant blue staining (see FIG. 17a).",

Cultures were grown to a density of 1.5 million cells per ml and then infected with three separate Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus each containing the gene for one of the G protein subunits at a 1:1 multiplicity of infection (the viruses were a generous gift from Dr. Alfred Gilman). After 40-48 hours of incubation the infected cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 75 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 65 mM NaCl, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1\u00d7PTT (35 \u03bcg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 32 \u03bcg/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 32 \u03bcg/ml tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone), 1\u00d7LS (3.2 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 3.2 \u03bcg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), and 10 \u03bcM GDP) per liter of culture volume. The suspension was pressurized with 600 psi N2 for 40 minutes in a nitrogen cavitation bomb (Parr Instrument Company). After depressurization, the lysate was centrifuged to remove nuclei and unlysed cells, and then ultracentrifuged at 180,000\u00d7g for 40 minutes. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in 30 ml wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcM MgCl2, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 10 \u03bcM GDP) per liter culture volume using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged again at 180,000\u00d7g for 40 minutes. The washed pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of wash buffer and flash frozen with liquid nitrogen.",
                                "The frozen membranes were thawed and diluted to a total protein concentration of 5 mg/ml with fresh wash buffer. Sodium cholate detergent was added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.0%, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mM, and 0.05 mg of purified protein phosphatase 5 (prepared in house) was added per liter of culture volume. The sample was stirred on ice for 40 minutes, and then centrifuged at 180,000\u00d7g for 40 minutes to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold with Ni-NTA load buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 363 mM NaCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 6.25 mM imidazole, 0.2% Anzergent 3-12, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 10 \u03bcM GDP), taking care to add the buffer slowly to avoid dropping the cholate concentration below its critical micelle concentration too quickly. 3 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) pre-equlibrated in Ni-NTA wash buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM imidazole, 0.2% Cholate, 0.15% Anzergent 3-12, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 10 \u03bcM GDP) per liter culture volume was added and the sample was stirred on ice for 20 minutes. The resin was collected into a gravity column and washed with 4\u00d7 column volumes of Ni-NTA wash buffer 1, Ni-NTA wash buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole, 0.15% Anzergent 3-12, 0.1% DDM, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM 10 \u03bcM GDP), and Ni-NTA wash buffer 3 (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM imidazole, 0.1% DDM, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 10 \u03bcM GDP). The protein was eluted with Ni-NTA elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 200 mM imidazole, 0.1% DDM, 1\u00d7PTT, 1\u00d7LS, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 10 \u03bcM GDP). Protein-containing fractions were pooled and MnCl2 was added to a final concentration of 100 \u03bcM. Fifty \u03bcg of purified lambda protein phosphatase (prepared in house) was added per liter of culture volume and the elute was incubated on ice with stirring for 30 minutes. The eluate was passed through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter and loaded directly onto a MonoQ HR 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in MonoQ buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 100 \u03bcM MgCl2, 0.1% DDM, 5 mM \u03b2-ME, 1\u00d7PTT). The column was washed with 150 ml buffer A at 5 ml/min and bound proteins were eluted over 350 ml with a linear gradient up to 28% MonoQ buffer B (same as buffer A except with 1 M NaCl). Fractions were collected in tubes spotted with enough GDP to make a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM. The Gs containing fractions were concentrated to 2 ml using a stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) with a 10 kDa NMWL regenerated cellulose membrane (Millipore). The concentrated sample was run on a Superdex 200 prep grade XK 16/70 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in S200 buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.012% DDM, 100 \u03bcM TCEP, 2 \u03bcM GDP). The fractions containing pure Gs were pooled, glycerol was added to 10% final concentration, and then the protein was concentrated to at least 10 mg/ml using a 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Millipore). The concentrated sample was then aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0. A typical yield of final, purified Gs heterotrimer from 8 liters of cell culture volume was 6 mg.",

G. et al. Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the beta(2) adrenoceptor. Nature 2011469, 175-180) followed by ion-exchange chromatography (FIG. 18a) using a Mono S10/100 GL column (GE Healthcare).

                                "Formation of a stable complex (see FIG. 19) was accomplished by mixing Gs heterotrimer at approximately 100 \u03bcM concentration with BI-167107 bound T4L-\u03b22AR (or \u03b22AR-365) in molar excess (approximately 130 \u03bcM) in 2 ml buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% DDM, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 \u03bcM BI-167107) and incubating for 3 hrs at room temperature. BI-167107, which was identified from screening and characterizing approximately 50 different \u03b22AR agonists, has a dissociation half-time of approximately 30 hrs providing higher degree of stabilization to the active G protein-bound receptor than other full agonists such as isoprotereriol (Rasmussen, S. G. et al. Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the beta(2) adrenoceptor. Nature 2011469, 175-180). To maintain the high-affinity nucleotide-free state of the complex, apyrase (25 mU/ml, NEB) was added after 90 min to hydrolyze residual GDP released from G<supon binding to the receptor. GMP resulting from hydrolysis of GDP by apyrase has very poor affinity for the G protein in the complex. Rebinding of GDP can cause dissociation of the R:G complex (FIG. 13A).",
                                "The R:G complex in DDM shows significant dissociation after 48 hours at 4\u00b0 C. (FIG. 20A). Over 50 amphiphiles were screened and identified MNG-3 (Rasmussen, S. G. et al. Structure of a nanobody-stabilized active state of the beta(2) adrenoceptor. Nature 2011469, 175-180; Chae, P. S. et al. Maltose-neopentyl glycol (MNG) amphiphiles for solubilization, stabilization and crystallization of membrane proteins. Nat Methods 7, 1003-1008; NG-310, Affymetrix-Anatrace) and its closely related analogs as detergents that substantially stabilize the complex (FIGS. 20A and B). The complex was exchanged into MNG-3 by adding the R:G mixture (2 ml) to 8 ml buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 \u03bcM BI-167107) containing 1% MNG-3 for 1 hr at room temperature.",
                                "At this stage the mixture contains the R:G complex, non-functional Gs, and an excess of \u03b22AR. To separate functional R:G complex from non-functional Gs, and to complete the detergent exchange, the R:G complex was immobilized on M1 Flag resin and washed in buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 \u03bcM BI-167107, and 3 mM CaCl2) containing 0.2% MNG-3. To prevent cysteine bridge-mediated aggregation of R:G complexes, 100 \u03bcM TCEP was added to the eluted protein prior to concentrating it with a 50 kDa MWCO Millipore concentrator. Of note, it was discovered later that crystal growth improved at even higher TCEP concentrations (above 1 mM) compared to 100 \u03bcM TCEP, and that the integrity of the R:G complex in MNG-3 was stable to 10 mM TCEP as measured by gel filtration analysis (FIG. 21C). In contrast, DDM-solubilized \u03b22AR loses its ability to bind the high-affinity antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol in 10 mM TCEP (data not shown), probably due to disruption of extracellular disulfide bonds. Iodoacetamide could not be used to block reactive cysteines on Gs alpha and beta subunits as it caused dissociation of the R:G complex (figure S9b). The final size exclusion chromatography procedure to separate excess free receptor from the R:G complex (FIG. 17b) was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 0.02% MNG-3, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 \u03bcM BI-167107, and 10011M TCEP. Peak fractions were pooled (FIG. 17b) and concentrated to approximately 90 mg ml\u22121 with a 100 kDa MWCO Viva-spin concentrator and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie brilliant blue staining (FIG. 17a) and gel filtration (FIG. 17c). To confirm a pure, homogeneous, and dephosphorylated preparation, the R:G complex is was routinely analyzed by ion exchange chromatography (FIG. 17d).",

                                "To increase the probability of obtaining crystals of the R:G complex two strategies were used to increase the polar surface area on the extracellular side of the receptor. The first approach, to generate extracellular binding antibodies, was not successful. The second approach was to replace the flexible and presumably unstructured N-terminus with the globular protein T4 lysozyme (T4L) used previously to crystallize and solve the carazolol-bound receptor (Rosenbaum, D. M. et al. GPCR engineering yields high-resolution structural insights into beta2-adrenergic receptor function. Science 2007 318, 1266-1273). The construct used here (T4L-\u03b22AR) contained the cleavable signal sequence followed by the M1 Flag epitope (DYKDDDDA; SEQ ID NO: 14), the TEV protease recognition sequence (ENLYFQG; SEQ ID NO: 15), bacteriophage T4 lysozyme from N2 through Y161 including C54T and C97A mutations, and a two residue alanine linker fused to the human \u03b22AR sequence D29 through G365. The PNGaseF-inaccessible glycosylation site of the \u03b22AR at N187 was mutated to Glu. M96 and M98 in the first extracellular loop were each replaced by Thr to increase the otherwise low expression level of T4L-\u03b22AR. The threonine mutations did not affect ligand binding affinity for 3H-dihydro-alprenolol, but caused a small, approximately two-fold decrease in affinity for isoproterenol.",
                                "The \u03b22AR-Gs peptide fusion construct used for [3H]-DHA competition binding with isoproterenol was constructed from the receptor truncated at position 365 and fused to the last 21 amino acids of the G\u03b1s subunit (amino acids 374-394, except for C379A). A Gly-Ser is inserted between the receptor and the peptide. Also an extended TEV protease site (SENLYFQGS; SEQ ID NO: 16) was introduced in the \u03b22AR between G360 and G361.",

                                "From negative stain EM imaging, we observed that the alpha helical domain of G\u03b1s was flexible and therefore possibly responsible for poor crystal quality. Targeted stabilization of this domain was addressed by immunizing two llamas (Llama glama) with the bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)glutarate (BS2G, Pierce) cross-linked \u03b22AR-Gs-BI-167107 ternary complex. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from the immunized animals to extract total RNA, prepare cDNA and construct a Nanobody phage display library according to published methods. Nb35 and Nb37 were enriched by two rounds of biopanning on the \u03b22AR-Gs-BI-167107 ternary complex embedded in biotinylated high-density lipoprotein particles (Whorton, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007 104, 7682-7687). Nb35 and Nb37 were selected for further characterization because they bind the \u03b22AR-Gs-BI-167107 ternary complex but not the free receptor in an ELISA assay. Nanobody binding to the R:G complex was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography (FIG. 13d), and it was noted that both nanobodies protected the complex from dissociation by GTP\u03b3S, suggestive of a stabilizing Gs:Nb interaction (FIG. 13d).",

                                "BI-167107 bound T4L-\u03b22AR:Gs complex and Nb35 were mixed in 1:1.2 molar ratio. The small molar excess of Nb35 was verified by analytical gel filtration (see FIG. 15b). The mixture incubated for 1 hr at room temperature prior to mixing with 7.7 MAG containing 10% cholesterol (C8667, Sigma) in 1:1 protein to lipid ratio (w/w) using the twin-syringe mixing method reported previously. The concentration of R:G:Nb complex in 7.7 MAG was approximately 25 mg ml\u22121. The detergent MNG-3 may stabilize the T4L-\u03b22AR-Gs complex during its incorporation into the lipid cubic phase. This may be due to the high affinity of MNG-3 for the receptor. The \u03b22AR in MNG-3 maintains its structural integrity even when diluted below the CMC of the detergent, in contrast to \u03b22AR in DDM, which rapidly loses binding activity (FIG. 20b). Moreover, MNG-3 improved crystal size and quality, as previously reported. The protein:lipid mixture was delivered through an LCP dispensing robot (Gryphon, Art Robbins Instruments) in 40 n1 drops to either 24-well or 96-well glass sandwich plates and overlaid en-bloc with 0.8 \u03bcl precipitant solution. Multiple crystallization leads were initially identified using in-house screens partly based on reagents from the StockOptions Salt kit (Hampton Research). Crystals for data collection were grown in 18 to 22% PEG 400, 100 mM MES pH 6.5 (FIG. 13c), 350 to 450 mM potassium nitrate, 10 mM foscarnet (FIG. 13b), 1 mM TCEP (FIG. 21c), and 10 \u03bcM BI-167107 Crystals reached full size within 3-4 days at 20\u00b0 C. and were picked from a sponge-like mesophase and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without additional cryo-protectant.",

Hundreds of crystals were screened, and a final dataset was compiled using diffraction wedges of typically 10 degrees from 20 strongly diffracting crystals. All data reduction was performed using HKL2000 (Otwinowski. & Minor, W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode. Methods Enzymol. 1997 276, 307-326). Although in many cases diffraction to beyond 3 \u212b was seen in initial frames, radiation damage and anisotropic diffraction resulted in low completeness in higher resolution shells. Analysis of the final dataset by the UCLA diffraction anisotropy server 31 indicated that diffraction along the a* axis was superior to that in other directions. On the basis of an F/\u03c3(F) cutoff of 3 along each reciprocal space axis, reflections were subjected to an anisotropic truncation with resolution limits of 2.9, 3.2, and 3.2 Angstroms along a*, b*, and c* prior to use in refinement. The structure is reported to an overall resolution of 3.2 \u212b.

In order, the search models used were: the \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits from a Gi heterotrimer (PDB ID: 1GP2), the Gs alpha ras-like domain (PDB ID: 1AZT), the active-state \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (PDB 3POG), a \u03b22AR binding nanobody (PDB ID: 3POG), T4 lysozyme (PDB ID: 2RH1), and the Gs alpha helical domain (PDB ID: 1AZT). Following the determination of the initial structure by molecular replacement, rigid body refinement and simulated annealing were performed in Phenix and BUSTER, followed by restrained refinement and manual rebuilding in Coot. After iterative refinement and manual adjustments, the structure was refined in CNS using the DEN method. Although the resolution of this structure exceeds that for which DEN is typically most useful, the presence of several poorly resolved regions indicated that the incorporation of additional information to guide refinement could provide better results. The DEN reference models used were those used for molecular replacement, with the exception of NB35, which was well ordered and for which no higher resolution structure is available. Side chains were omitted from 52 residues for which there was no electron density past Chi below a low contour is level of 0.7a in a 2Fo-Fc map.

                                "One challenge for crystallogenesis was to prepare a stable \u03b22AR-Gs complex in detergent solution. The \u03b22AR and Gs couple efficiently in lipid bilayers, but not in detergents used to solubilize and purify these proteins. We found that a relatively stable \u03b22AR-Gs complex could be prepared by mixing purified GDP-Gs (approximately 100 \u03bcM final concentration) with a molar excess of purified \u03b22AR bound to a high affinity agonist (BI-167107, Boehringer Ingelheim) in dodecylmaltoside solution. Apyrase, a non-selective purine pyrophosphatase, was added to hydrolyze GDP released from Gs on forming a complex with the \u03b22AR. The complex was subsequently purified by sequential antibody affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The stability of the complex was enhanced by exchanging it into a recently developed maltose neopentyl glycol detergent (NG-310, Anatrace). The complex could be incubated at room temperature for 24 hrs without any noticeable degradation; however, initial efforts to crystallize the complex using sparse matrix screens in detergent micelles, bicelles and lipidic cubic phase (LCP) failed.",
                                "To further assess the quality of the complex, the protein was analyzed by single particle electron microscopy (EM). The results confirmed that the complex was monodispersed, and revealed two potential problems for obtaining diffraction of quality crystals. First, the detergent used to stabilize the complex formed a large micelle, leaving little polar surface on the extracellular side of the \u03b22AR-Gs complex for the formation of crystal lattice contacts. The initial approach to this problem, which was to generate antibodies to the extracellular surface, was not successful. As an alternative approach, we replaced the amino terminus of the \u03b22AR with T4 lysozyme (T4L). Several different amino-terminal fusion proteins were prepared and single particle EM was used to identify a fusion with a relatively fixed orientation of T4L in relation to the \u03b22AR.",
                                "The second problem revealed by single particle EM analysis was increased variability in the positioning of the \u03b1-helical component of the G\u03b1s subunit. G\u03b1s consists of two domains, the ras-like GTPase domain (G\u03b1sRas), which interacts with the \u03b22AR and the G\u03b2 subunit, and the \u03b1-helical domain (G\u03b1sAH). The interface of the two G\u03b1s subdomains forms the nucleotide-binding pocket (FIG. 7), and EM 2D averages and 3D reconstructions show that in the absence of guanine nucleotide, G\u03b1sAH has a variable position relative to the complex of T4L-\u03b22AR-G\u03b1sRAS-G\u03b2\u03b3 (FIG. 7b).",
                                "The variable position of G\u03b1sAH was attributed to the empty nucleotide-binding pocket. However, both GDP and nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs disrupt the \u03b22AR-Gs complex (FIG. 13). The addition of pyrophosphate and its analog phosphonoformate (foscarnet) led to a significant increase in stabilization of G\u03b1sAH as determined by EM analysis of the detergent solubilized complex. Crystallization trials were carried out in Lipidic Cubic Phase (LCP) using a modified monolein designed to accommodate the large hydrophilic component of the T4L-\u03b22AR-Gs complex (Misquitta, L. V. et al. Membrane protein crystallization in lipidic mesophases with tailored bilayers. Structure 2004 12, 2113-2124). Although we were able to obtain small crystals that diffracted to 7 \u212b, we were unable to improve their quality through the use of additives and other modifications.",
                                "In an effort to generate an antibody that would further stabilize the complex and facilitate crystallogenesis, \u03b22AR and the Gs heterotrimer were crosslinked with a small, homobifunctional amine-reactive crosslinker and used this stabilized complex to immunized llamas. Llamas and other camelids produce antibodies devoid of light chains. The single domain antigen binding fragments of these heavy chain only antibodies, known as nanobodies, are small (15 kDa), rigid and are easily cloned and expressed in E. coli. A nanobody (Nb35) was obtained that binds to the complex and prevents dissociation of the complex by GTP\u03b3S (FIG. 13). The T4L-\u03b22AR-Gs-Nb35 complex was used to obtain crystals that grew to 250 microns (FIG. 14) in LCP (monoolein 7.7) and diffracted to 2.9 \u212b. A 3.2 \u212b data set was obtained from 20 crystals and the structure was determined by molecular replacement.",
                                "The \u03b22AR-Gs complex crystallized in space group P21, with a single complex in each asymmetric unit. FIG. 8a shows the crystallographic packing interactions. Complexes are arrayed in alternating aqueous and lipidic layers with lattice contacts formed almost exclusively between soluble components of the complex, leaving receptor molecules suspended between G protein layers and widely separated from one another in the plane of the membrane. Extensive lattice contacts were formed among all the soluble proteins, likely accounting for the strong overall diffraction and remarkably clear electron density for the G protein. Nb35 and T4L facilitated crystal formation. Nb35 packs at the interface of G\u03b2 and G\u03b1 subunits with complementarity determining region (CDR) 1 interacting primarily with G\u03b2 and a long CDR3 loop interacting with both G\u03b2 and G\u03b1 subunits. The framework regions of Nb35 from one complex also interact with G\u03b1 subunits from two adjacent complexes. T4L forms relatively sparse interactions with the amino terminus of the receptor, but packs against the amino terminus of the G\u03b2 subunit of one complex, the carboxyl terminus of the G\u03b2 subunit of another complex, and the G\u03b2 subunit of yet another complex. FIG. 8b shows the structure of the complete complex including T4L and Nb35, and FIG. 8c shows the \u03b22AR-Gs complex alone."

FIG. 9a compares the structures of the agonist-bound receptor in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex and the inactive carazolol-bound \u03b22AR. The largest difference between the inactive and active structures is a 14 \u212b outward movement of TM6 when measured at the C\u03b1 carbon of E268. There is a smaller outward movement and extension of the cytoplasmic end of the TM5 helix by 7 residues. A stretch of 26 amino acids in the third intracellular loop (ICL3) is disordered. Another notable difference between inactive and active structures is the second intracellular loop (ICL2), which forms an extended loop in the inactive \u03b22AR structure and an \u03b1-helix in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex. This helix is also observed in the \u03b22AR-Nb80 structure (FIG. 9b); however, it may not be a feature that is unique to the active state, since it is also observed in the inactive structure of the highly homologous avian \u03b21AR.",
                                "The quality of the electron density maps for the P2AR is highest at this \u03b22AR-G\u03b1sRas interface, and much weaker for the extracellular half, possibly due to the lack of crystal lattice contacts with the extracellular surface (FIG. 8a). As a result, we cannot confidently model the high-affinity agonist (BI-167107) in the ligand-binding pocket. However, the overall structure of the \u03b22AR in the T4L-\u03b22AR-Gs complex is very similar to our recent active-state structure of \u03b22AR stabilized by a G protein mimetic nanobody (Nb80). These structures deviate primarily at the cytoplasmic ends of TMs 5 and 6 (FIG. 9b), possibly due to the presence of T4L that replaces ICL3 in the \u03b22AR-Nb80 structure. Nonetheless, the \u03b22AR-Nb80 complex exhibits the same high affinity for the agonist isoproterenol as does the \u03b22AR-Gs complex, consistent with high structural homology around the ligand binding pocket. The electron density maps for the \u03b22AR-Nb80 crystals provide a more reliable view of the conformational rearrangements of amino acids around the ligand-binding pocket and between the ligand-binding pocket and the Gs-coupling interface.",
                                "FIG. 9c shows the position of the highly conserved sequence motifs including D/ERY and NPxxY in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex compared with the \u03b22AR-Nb80 complex (see also Fig. S3). These conserved sequences have been proposed to be important for activation or for maintaining the receptor in the inactive state. The positions of these amino acids are essentially identical in these two structures demonstrating that Nb80 is a very good G protein surrogate. Only Arg131 differs between these two structures. In the \u03b22AR-Nb80 structure Arg131 interacts with Nb80, whereas in the \u03b22AR-Gs structure Arg131 packs against Tyr391 of G\u03b1s (FIG. 15).",
                                "The active state of the \u03b22AR is stabilized by extensive interactions with (G\u03b1sRas) (FIG. 10). There are no direct interactions with G\u03b2 or G\u03b3 subunits. The total buried surface of the \u03b22AR-G<sRas interface is 2576 \u212b2 (1300 \u212b2 for G<sRas and 1276 \u212b2 for the \u03b22AR). This interface is formed by ICL2, TM5 and TM6 of the \u03b22AR, and by \u03b15-helix, the \u03b1N-\u03b21 junction, the top of the \u03b23-strand, and the \u03b14-helix of G\u03b1sRas (see Table 1 below for specific interactions). The \u03b22AR sequences involved in this interaction have been shown to play a role in G protein coupling; however, there is no clear consensus sequence for Gs-coupling specificity when these segments are aligned with other GPCRs. Perhaps this is not surprising considering that the \u03b22AR also couples to Gi and that many GPCRs couple to more than one G protein isoform. The structural basis for G protein coupling specificity must therefore involve more subtle features of the secondary and tertiary structure. Nevertheless, a noteworthy interaction involves Phe139, which is located at the beginning of the ICL2 helix and sits in a hydrophobic pocket formed by G\u03b1s His41 at the beginning of the p1-strand, Val213 at the start of the \u03b23-strand and Phe376, Arg380 and Ile383 in the \u03b15-helix (FIG. 4c). The \u03b22AR mutant F139A displays severely impaired coupling to Gs. The residue corresponding to Phe139 is a Phe or Leu on almost all Gs coupled receptors, but is more variable in GPCRs known to couple to other G proteins. Of interest, the ICL2 helix is stabilized by an interaction between Asp130 of the conserved DRY sequence and Tyr141 in the middle of the ICL2 helix (FIG. 10c). Tyr141 has been shown to be a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase; however, the functional significance of this phosphorylation is currently unknown."

                                "One surprising observation in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex is the large displacement of the G\u03b1sAH relative to G\u03b1sRas (an approximately 127\u00b0 rotation about the junction between the domains) (FIG. 11a). In the crystal structure of G\u03b1s, the nucleotide-binding pocket is formed by the interface between G\u03b1sRas and G\u03b1sAH. Guanine nucleotide binding stabilizes the interaction between these two domains. The loss of this stabilizing effect of guanine nucleotide binding is consistent with the high flexibility observed for G\u03b1sAH in single particle EM analysis of the detergent solubilized complex. It is also in agreement with the increase in deuterium exchange at the interface between these two domains upon formation of the complex. Recently Hamm, Hubbell and colleagues, using double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, documented large (up to 20 \u212b) changes in distance between nitroxide probes positioned on the Ras and \u03b1-helical domains of Gi upon formation of a complex with light-activated rhodopsin. Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that G<sAH is displaced relative to G\u03b1sRas; however, its location in this crystal structure most likely reflects only one of an ensemble of conformations that it can adopt under physiological conditions, but has been stabilized by crystal packing interactions.",
                                "The conformational links between the \u03b22AR and the nucleotide-binding pocket primarily involve the amino and carboxyl terminal helices of G\u03b1s (FIG. 10). FIG. 11b focuses on the region of G\u03b1sRas that undergoes the largest conformational change when comparing the structure of G\u03b1sRas from the Gs-\u03b22AR complex with that from the G\u03b1s-GTP\u03b3S complex. The largest difference is observed for the \u03b15-helix, which is displaced 6 \u212b towards the receptor and rotated as the carboxyl terminal end projects into transmembrane core of the \u03b22AR. Associated with this movement, the \u03b26-\u03b15 loop, which interacts with the guanine ring in the G\u03b1s-GTP\u03b3S structure, is displaced outward, away from the nucleotide-binding pocket (FIG. 11b-d). The movement of \u03b15-helix is also associated with changes in interactions between this helix and the \u03b26-strand, the \u03b1N-\u03b21 loop, and the \u03b11-helix. The \u03b21-strand forms another link between the \u03b22AR and the nucleotide-binding pocket. The C-terminal end of this strand changes conformation around Gly47, and there are further changes in the \u03b21-\u03b11 loop (P-loop) that coordinates the \u03b3-phosphate in the GTP-bound form (FIG. 11 b-d). The observations in the crystal structure are in agreement with deuterium exchange experiments where there is enhanced deuterium exchange in the \u03b21-strand and the amino terminal end of the \u03b15-helix upon formation of the nucleotide-free \u03b22AR-Gs complex. The DXMS studies provide additional insights into the dynamic nature of these conformational changes in Gs upon complex formation.",
                                "The structure of a GDP-bound Gs heterotrimer has not been determined in this study, so it is not possible to directly compare the G\u03b1s-G\u03b2\u03b3 interface before and after formation of the \u03b22AR-Gs complex. Based on the structure of the GDP-bound Gi heterotrimer, large changes in interactions between G\u03b1sRas and G\u03b2\u03b3 upon formation of the complex with \u03b22AR are not observed. This is also consistent with deuterium exchange studies. It should be noted that Nb35 binds at the interface between G\u03b1sRas and G\u03b2 (FIG. 8b). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that Nb35 may influence the relative orientation of the G\u03b1sRas-G\u03b2\u03b3 interface in the crystal structure. However, single particle EM studies provide evidence that Nb35 does not disrupt interactions between G\u03b1sAH and G\u03b1sRas.",

                                "Clues to the initial stages of complex formation may come from the recent active state structures of rhodopsin. FIGS. 12a and b compare the active-state structure of \u03b22AR in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex with the recent structure of metarhodopsin II bound to the transducin peptide. The conformational changes in TM5 and TM6 are smaller in metarhodopsin II, and the position of the carboxyl terminal alpha helix of transducin is tilted by approximately 30\u00b0 relative to the position of the homologous region of Gs. These may represent fundamental differences in the receptor-G protein interactions between these two proteins, but given the strong conservation of the G-protein binding pocket, the changes more likely reflect the extensive contacts formed with the intact G protein. The position of the transducin peptide in metarhodopsin II may represent the initial interaction between a GDP-bound G protein and a GPCR. We have attempted to reproduce a similar complex between the \u03b22AR and a synthetic peptide representing the carboxyl terminal 20 amino acids of Gs, but did not observe any effect of this peptide on receptor function, possibly due to the solubility and behavior of the peptide in solution. However, when the carboxyl terminal 20 amino acids of Gs are fused to the carboxyl terminus of the \u03b22AR (FIG. 12c), we observe a 27-fold increase in agonist affinity (FIG. 12d). This effect is only 3.5-fold smaller than the effect we observe on agonist binding affinity in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex, and demonstrates that there is a functional interaction between the peptide and receptor that may represent an initial stage in \u03b22AR-Gs complex formation. FIG. 12 e, f presents a possible sequence of interactions of \u03b22AR and Gs when forming the nucleotide free complex. The initial interaction of the P2AR with Gs would require an outward movement of the carboxyl terminus of the \u03b15-helix away from the \u03b26-strand to permit interactions with the \u03b22AR similar to those observed in metarhodopsin II. The dynamic character of the carboxyl terminal end of \u03b15 is supported by deuterium exchange studies and the relatively loose packing of \u03b15 with the rest of G\u03b1sRas in the structure of G\u03b1s alone. The subsequent formation of more extensive interactions between the \u03b22AR ICL 2 and the amino terminus of G\u03b1s requires a rotation of G\u03b1sRas relative to the receptor and would be associated with further conformational changes in both \u03b22AR and G\u03b1sRas (FIG. 12f). This binding model is in agreement with deuterium exchange experiments.",

The lack of interactions between T4L and the extracellular surface of the \u03b22AR in the \u03b22AR-Gs complex suggested that T4L fused to the N terminus of the \u03b22AR might not be sufficiently constrained to facilitate crystallogenesis in the absence of the cytoplasmic G protein. The amino terminal T4L facilitated crystallogenesis in the absence of a soluble protein bound or fused to the third intracellular loop. Additional modifications were made to minimize unstructured sequence in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus (FIG. 22). The C-terminus was truncated after amino acid 365. The 3rd intracellular loop (ICL3) of \u03b22AR is another flexible region and it is subject to proteolysis. This loop was truncated in the fusion protein by removing residues 235 to 263. The final construct T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 is illustrated in FIG. 22.",
                                "To determine the functional integrity of T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, agonist and antagonist binding affinities were determined. The ligand binding pocket is formed by amino acids from four transmembrane domains and is therefore very sensitive to any perturbation of the receptor structure. T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 exhibits ligand binding affinities for the antagonist [3H]-Dihydroalprenolol and the agonist isopreterenol that are comparable to those of the wild type receptor (FIG. 25).",
                                "Purified T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 bound to the inverse agonist carazolol crystallized as small rods in lipid cubic phase (37% PEG300 (v/v), 0.1M Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, 0.1 M ammonium phosphate). Crystals diffracted to a resolution of 3.3 \u212b; however, due to radiation damage, our dataset was limited to 4.0 (Table 4). Nevertheless, the dataset allowed us to solve the structure by molecular replacement. The interaction between the \u03b22AR and T4L is sufficiently rigid to detect electron density for the 2 Ala link between these two proteins (FIG. 26). This link was not detectable in the electron density map of the \u03b22AR-Gs structure (FIG. 24). In the T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 crystal lattice, the packing interactions are primarily mediated by T4L and there are no contacts between adjacent receptors (FIG. 23), indicating the important role of the T4L in facilitating GPCR crystallization. Each T4L has four packing interactions: 1\u2014against ECL1 and ECL2 of its fused \u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, 2\u2014against T4L of one adjacent T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, 3\u2014against T4L, ECL2 and ECL3 of a second T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3, and 4\u2014against ICL3 and Helix 8 of a third T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 (FIG. 23).",
                                "The structures of the \u03b22AR in T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 and \u03b22AR-T4L (pdb 2RH1) are very similar to each other (FIG. 27), with an overall root mean square deviation of 0.48 \u212b. Only minor differences can be observed in these two structures, presumably due to different crystal packing patterns. The similarity of the structures determined independently through different strategies further validates the fusion protein approach, demonstrating that structural distortions due to protein engineering or crystal packing are unlikely.",
                                "Of interest, ICL2 in the two inactive structures of \u03b22AR-Fab5 and \u03b22AR-T4L is in an extended loop while it is an alpha helix in both active structures: the \u03b22AR-Gs complex and the \u03b22AR stabilized by Nb80. In both of the inactive structures (\u03b22AR-Fab5 and \u03b22AR-T4L), ICL2 participates in lattice contacts that may influence its conformation. However, in the T4L-\u03b22AR-\u0394-ICL3 structure ICL2 is not involved in packing interactions, yet is an extended loop is nearly identical to that observed in the other inactive state \u03b22AR structures (FIG. 27). Thus, this extended loop structure may reflect an inactive state.",
                                "In conclusion, fusion of T4L to the amino terminus of a GPCR can facilitate crystallogenesis. This approach can also facilitate the formation of crystals of a GPCR in complex with a cytoplasmic signaling protein.",
                                "FIG. 28 illustrates shows the structure of T4L-\u03b22AR fusion bound to salmeterol, a partial agonist used to treat asthma. In this structure, the partial-active state is stabilized by a nanobody (nanobody 71). This structure was obtained using similar methods to those described above."
