    "abstract": "The present invention is related to antigens from Chlamydia trachomatis which are recognized by specific antibodies from individuals infected with Chlamydia or which can induce T cells from the same individuals to secrete gamma-interferon. The T cell reactive antigens are present in a whole-cell lysate and have apparent molecular weights of 5-12, 16-20, 25-35 and 58-74 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. The antigens of the invention are useful in vaccines but also as diagnostic compositions.",

                        "Chlamydial species cause a wide range of diseases in both animals and humans. Of particular concern is C. trachomatis, an obligatory intracellular bacterium, which infects and multiplies in epithelial cells. It is the most frequent cause of sexually transmitted disease (STD) in developed countries and it is the most common cause of ocular disease in developing countries (Schachter, Moncada et al. 1988). There is an estimated 92 million individuals who carry the infection globally (WHO, 1999).",
                        "The duration of untreated Chlamydia STD is prolonged, and complete clearance is often not reached within the first 12 months. The protective immunity induced during the infection is thought to be serovariant-specific and short-lived, thus allowing frequent re-infections (Katz, Batteiger et al. 1987). These circumstances, the prolonged course of infection and the possible re-infections may lead to the development of serious sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancies (Brunham 1999).",
                        "The infection is effectively controlled by antibiotic therapy; however the high prevalence of asymptomatic cases suggests that sustainable Chlamydia control can only be envisaged if an effective Chlamydia vaccine is developed. While much effort has been devoted to a vaccine against Chlamydia infections over the last few decades, so far no vaccine has been developed.",
                        "This makes the development of a vaccine against Chlamydia an urgent matter. Many attempts to define protective chlamydial substances have been made, however, the demonstration of a specific long-term protective immune response has not yet been achieved. Over the last several decades much effort has been devoted into developing a vaccine against Chlamydia infections however, so far no vaccine has been developed. Some of the first efforts were focused on controlling trachoma, and whole viable or inactivated organisms were used as the antigen to immunize humans and monkeys (Wang, Grayston et al. 1967; Grayston and Wang 1978). Children vaccinated with an inactivated whole-cell vaccine initially resulted in protection but the protection was serovar specific and short-lived (Grayston and Wang 1978). Furthermore, reinfection of partially protected individuals resulted in clinical disease that was more sever than the disease occurring in non-vaccinated controls (Grayston and Wang 1978). The fact that the initial trials with inactivated whole organisms resulted in some cases of what appeared to be a hypersensitivity reaction prompted attempts to develop subunit vaccines.",
                        "C. trachomatis holds, as well as secretes, several proteins of potential relevance for the generation of a chlamydia vaccine. For a number of years, the search for candidate molecules has primarily focused on proteins associated with the surface of the infectious form the Elementary Body (EB). Despite the characterization of a large number of such proteins only a few of these have been demonstrated to elicit partial protection as subunit vaccines in animal models. The first immunogenic molecule described was the major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and this molecule has therefore been studied in great detail as a candidate vaccine. However, many attempts to immunize different animals with MOMP extracted from C. trachomatis or recombinant preparations gave variable results (Su, Parnell et al. 1995; Pal, Barnhart et al. 1999; Zhang, Yang et al. 1999; Pal, Theodor et al. 2001; Shaw, Grund et al. 2002). The reason for the relative ineffectiveness of MOMP as a vaccine is not known, but may result from inadequate adjuvants or delivery systems or from use of MOMP immunogens that do not mimic the native structure of the protein (Pal, Theodor et al. 2001)",
                        "More recently, several other immunogenic molecules have been identified (Hassell, Reynolds et al. 1993; Kubo and Stephens 2000; LaVerda, Albanese et al. 2000; Fling, Sutherland et al. 2001; Goodall, Yeo et al. 2001; Starnbach, Loomis et al. 2003). Immunity to C. trachomatis is characterized by some basic features; specifically sensitized T lymphocytes mediates protection (Su and Caldwell 1995; Morrison, Su et al. 2000; Morrison and Caldwell 2002), and the most important mediator molecule seems to be interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (Morrison and Caldwell 2002). Additionally antibodies of the IgG, IgM, and IgA isotypes may also play a role (Cotter, Meng et al. 1995). In 1995 Tripples et al. (Tipples and McClarty 1995) isolated the gene for the CTP synthetase and Gu et al. (Gu, Wenman et al. 1995) cloned the region surrounding the gene for the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase. This region also contains genes for the proteins SecY, S13, S11, and L17, which are equivalent to Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis proteins. In 1997, the gene for elongation factor Ts was isolated (Zhang, Tao et al. 1997).",
                        "In 1998 Stevens et al published the complete genome sequence of C. trachomatis and predicted the presence of approximately 875 open reading frames. Among others, nucleotide sequences comprising CT442, CT460, CT509 CT579, CT587, CT713, CT812, or CT681 (MOMP) are described, and putative protein sequences for the above sequences are suggested. However importantly, this sequence information cannot be used to predict if the DNA is transcribed and translated into proteins in vivo.",
                        "More importantly, it is not possible on the basis of the sequences, to predict whether a given sequence will encode an immunogenic or an inactive protein. WO9928475 describes the complete genome sequence of C. trachomatis but has no evidence in support of any immunogenic effect whatsoever. Correspondingly WO9927105 describes the complete genome sequence of C. pneumoniae.",
                        "The only way to determine if a protein is recognized by the immune system during or after an infection with C. trachomatis is to produce the given protein and test it in an appropriate assay as described herein and possibly determine the fragment or epitope that has an immunogenic effect."

The immunogenic portion of a polypeptide may be a T-cell epitope or a B-cell epitope. Immunogenic portions can be related to one or a few relatively small parts of the polypeptide, they can be scattered throughout the polypeptide sequence or be situated in specific parts of the polypeptide. For a few polypeptides epitopes have even been demonstrated to be scattered throughout the polypeptide covering the full sequence (Ravn, Demissie et al. 1999).\n\nIn order to identify relevant T-cell epitopes which are recognised during an immune response, it is possible to use a \u201cbrute force\u201d method: Since T-cell epitopes are linear, deletion mutants of the polypeptide will, if constructed systematically, reveal what regions of the polypeptide are essential in immune recognition, e.g. by subjecting these deletion mutants e.g. to the IFN\u03b3 assay described herein. Another method utilises overlapping oligopeptides for the detection of MHC class II epitopes, preferably synthetic, having a length of e.g. 20 amino acid residues derived from the polypeptide. These peptides can be tested in biological assays (e.g. the IFN\u03b3 assay as described herein) and some of these will give a positive response (and thereby be immunogenic) as evidence for the presence of a T cell epitope in the peptide. For the detection of MHC class I epitopes it is possible to predict peptides that will bind (Stryhn, Pedersen et al. 1996) and hereafter produce these peptides synthetic and test them in relevant biological assays e.g. the IFN\u03b3 assay as described herein. The peptides preferably having a length of e.g. 8 to 11 amino acid residues derived from the polypeptide. B-cell epitopes can be determined by analysing the B cell recognition to overlapping peptides covering the polypeptide of interest as e.g. described in Harboe et al (Harboe, Oettinger et al. 1996).",
                                "Although the minimum length of a T-cell epitope has been shown to be at least 6 amino acids, it is normal that such epitopes are constituted of longer stretches of amino acids. Hence, it is preferred that the polypeptide fragment of the invention has a length of at least 7 amino acid residues, such as at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 12, at least 14, at least 16, at least 18, at least 20, at least 22, at least 24, and at least 30 amino acid residues. Hence, in important embodiments of the inventive method, it is preferred that the polypeptide fragment has a length of at most 50 amino acid residues, such as at most 40, 35, 30, 25, and 20 amino acid residues. It is expected that the peptides having a length of between 10 and 20 amino acid residues will prove to be most efficient as MCH class II epitopes and therefore especially preferred lengths of the polypeptide fragment used in the inventive method are 18, such as 15, 14, 13, 12 and even 11 amino acid residues. It is expected that the peptides having a length of between 7 and 12 amino acid residues will prove to be most efficient as MCH class I epitopes and therefore especially preferred lengths of the polypeptide fragment used in the inventive method are 11, such as 10, 9, 8 and even 7 amino acid residues.",
                                "Immunogenic portions of polypeptides may be recognised by a broad part (high frequency) or by a minor part (low frequency) of the genetically heterogenic human population. In addition some immunogenic portions induce high immunological responses (dominant), whereas others induce lower, but still significant, responses (subdominant). High frequency><low frequency can be related to the immunogenic portion binding to widely distributed MHC molecules (HLA type) or even by multiple MHC molecules (Kilgus, Jardetzky et al. 1991) (Sinigaglia, Guttinger et al. 1988).",

                                "An immunogenic polypeptide is defined as a polypeptide that induces an immune response in a biological sample or an individual currently or previously infected with a chlamydia. The immune response may be monitored by one of the following methods:\n\n\n- - An in vitro cellular response is determined by release of a relevant\n    cytokine such as IFN\u03b3, from lymphocytes withdrawn from an animal or\n    human being currently or previously infected with chlamydia, or by\n    detection of proliferation of these T cells. The induction being\n    performed by the addition of the polypeptide or the immunogenic\n    portion to a suspension comprising from 1\u00d710\u2075 cells to 3\u00d710\u2075 cells\n    per well. The cells being isolated from either the blood, the\n    spleen, the liver or the lung and the addition of the polypeptide or\n    the immunogenic portion resulting in a concentration of not more\n    than 20 \u03bcg per ml suspension and the stimulation being performed\n    from two to five days. For monitoring cell proliferation the cells\n    are pulsed with radioactive labeled Thymidine and after 16-22 hours\n    of incubation detecting the proliferation by liquid scintillation\n    counting. A positive response being a response more than background\n    plus two standard deviations. The release of IFN\u03b3 can be determined\n    by the ELISA method, which is well known to a person skilled in the\n    art. A positive response being a response more than background plus\n    two standard deviations. Other cytokines than IFN\u03b3 could be relevant\n    when monitoring the immunological response to the polypeptide, such\n    as IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2. Another and more\n    sensitive method for determining the presence of a cytokine (e.g.\n    IFN\u03b3) is the ELISPOT method where the cells isolated from either the\n    blood, the spleen, the liver or the lung are diluted to a\n    concentration of preferable of 1 to 4\u00d710\u2076 cells/ml and incubated for\n    18-22 hrs in the presence of the polypeptide or the immunogenic\n    portion resulting in a concentration of not more than 20 \u03bcg per ml.\n    The cell suspensions are hereafter diluted to 1 to 2\u00d710\u2076/ml and\n    transferred to Maxisorp plates coated with anti-IFN\u03b3 and incubated\n    for preferably 4 to 16 hours. The IFN\u03b3 producing cells are\n    determined by the use of labelled secondary anti-IFN\u03b3 antibody and a\n    relevant substrate giving rise to spots, which can be enumerated\n    using a dissection microscope. It is also a possibility to determine\n    the presence of mRNA coding for the relevant cytokine by the use of\n    the PCR technique. Usually one or more cytokines will be measured\n    utilizing for example the PCR, ELISPOT or ELISA. It will be\n    appreciated by a person skilled in the art that a significant\n    increase or decrease in the amount of any of these cytokines induced\n    by a specific polypeptide can be used in evaluation of the\n    immunological activity of the polypeptide.\n  - An in vitro cellular response may also be determined by the use of T\n    cell lines derived from an immune individual or a *C. trachomatis*\n    infected person where the T cell lines have been driven with either\n    live chlamydia or extracts from the bacterial cell for 10 to 20 days\n    with the addition of IL-2. The induction being performed by addition\n    of not more than 20 \u03bcg polypeptide per ml suspension to the T cell\n    lines containing from 1\u00d710\u2075 cells to 3\u00d710\u2075 cells per well and\n    incubation being performed from two to six days. The induction of\n    IFN\u03b3 or release of another relevant cytokine is detected by ELISA.\n    The stimulation of T cells can also be monitored by detecting cell\n    proliferation using radioactively labeled Thymidine as described\n    above. For both assays a positive response being a response more\n    than background plus two standard deviations.\n  - An in vivo cellular response which may be determined as a positive\n    DTH response after intradermal injection or local application patch\n    of at most 100 \u03bcg of the polypeptide or the immunogenic portion to\n    an individual who is clinically or subclinically infected with\n    chlamydia, a positive response having a diameter of at least 5 mm\n    72-96 hours after the injection or application.",
                                "An in vitro humoral response is determined by a specific antibody response in an immune or infected individual. The presence of antibodies may be determined by an ELISA technique or a Western blot where the polypeptide or the immunogenic portion is absorbed to either a nitrocellulose membrane or a polystyrene surface. The serum is preferably diluted in PBS from 1:10 to 1:100 and added to the absorbed polypeptide and the incubation being performed from 1 to 12 hours. By the use of labeled secondary antibodies the presence of specific antibodies can be determined by measuring the OD e.g. by ELISA where a positive response is a response of more than background plus two standard deviations or alternatively a visual response in a Western blot.\n\n\n- - Another relevant parameter is measurement of the protection in\n    animal models induced after vaccination with the polypeptide in an\n    adjuvant or after DNA vaccination. Suitable animal models include\n    primates, guinea pigs or mice, which are challenged with an\n    infection of chlamydia. Readout for induced protection could be\n    decrease of the bacterial load in target organs compared to\n    non-vaccinated animals, prolonged survival times compared to\n    non-vaccinated animals and diminished weight loss compared to\n    non-vaccinated animals."

For instance, fusion partners that facilitate export of the polypeptide when produced recombinantly, fusion partners that facilitate purification of the polypeptide, and fusion partners which enhance the immunogenicity of the polypeptide fragment of the invention are all interesting possibilities. Therefore, the invention also pertains to a fusion polypeptide comprising at least one polypeptide or immunogenic portion defined above and at least one fusion partner. The fusion partner can, in order to enhance immunogenicity, be another polypeptide derived from C. trachomatis, such as a polypeptide fragment derived from Chlamydia species, such as CT812, CT579, CT587 (Goodall, Yeo et al. 2001), Cap (Fling, Sutherland et al. 2001), CT713 (Kubo and Stephens 2000), CT442 (Starnbach, Loomis et al. 2003), or MOMP (Stephens, Wagar et al. 1988) or at least one T-cell epitope or B cell epitope of any of the above mentioned.

In order to facilitate expression and/or purification, the fusion partner can e.g. be a bacterial fimbrial protein, e.g. the pilus components pilin and papA; protein A; the ZZ-peptide (ZZ-fusions are marketed by Pharmacia in Sweden); the maltose binding protein; gluthatione S-transferase; \u03b2-galac-tosidase; or poly-histidine. Fusion proteins can be produced recombinantly in a host cell, which could be E. coli, and it is a possibility to induce a linker region between the different fusion partners.",
                                "Other interesting fusion partners are polypeptides, which are lipidated so that the immunogenic polypeptide is presented in a suitable manner to the immune system. This effect is e.g. known from vaccines based on the Borrelia burgdorferi OspA polypeptide as described in e.g. WO 96/40718 A or vaccines based on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprI lipoprotein (Cote-Sierra, Jongert et al. 1998). Another possibility is N-terminal fusion of a known signal sequence and an N-terminal cystein to the immunogenic polypeptide. Such a fusion results in lipidation of the immunogenic polypeptide at the N-terminal cystein, when produced in a suitable production host."

                                "The present invention discloses antigenic components of C. trachomatis which have:\n\n\n- - 1) the capacity to stimulate T cells from patients with a urogenital\n    *Chlamydia* infection to secrete INF\u03b3, or\n  - 2) the capacity to stimulate T cells from patients with a urogenital\n    *Chlamydia* infection to secrete cytokines which inhibit *Chlamydia*\n    growth in vitro, or\n  - 3) is recognized by serum IgG, and/or IgM, and/or IgA, antibodies\n    from patients with a urogenital chlamydia infection, or\n  - 4) is recognized by T cells and/or antibodies from mice\n    experimentally infected with *Chlamydia muridarum* and/or *C.\n    trachomatis*, or\n  - 5) is able by administration to induce an immune response in mice\n    which recognize the *C. trachomatis* bacterial antigen, or\n  - 6) is able by vaccination to provide at least partial immunity\n    against an experimental challenge infection with *Chlamydia\n    muridarum* and/or *C. trachomatis.*",
                                "Firstly, in order to identify the molecular targets of protective T cells among proteins from C. trachomatis, a protein lysate of C. trachomatis serovar D (strain UW-3/Cx, ATCC No: VR-885) was fractionated by the multi-elution technique (Andersen and Heron 1993). This technique separates proteins in a complex protein mixture according to their molecular weight into narrow fractions which are then used to stimulate Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) in vitro. After several days of incubation the release of INF\u03b3 is monitored by ELISA (FIG. 1). The responses of Chlamydia patients were compared to the responses of normal blood donors with no previous diagnosis of Chlamydia infection. This comparison allows identification of C. trachomatis proteins which have the capacity to trigger effector T cells to release INF\u03b3 during the first phases of the human infection. Using this approach it was demonstrated that the targets for these protective T cells are proteins or fragments of proteins with apparent molecular weights of 5-12, 16-20, 25-35 and 58-74 kDa (FIGS. 2 and 3). The precise identity of bacterial proteins within each stimulatory region was determined by mass spectrometry.",
                                "To further identify and characterise the stimulating antigens, each specific C. trachomatis antigens may be a) purified antigens from C. trachomatis extracts as exemplified in Example 1, b) antigens produced and purified from E. coli as exemplified in Example 1, c) overlapping synthetic peptides as exemplified in Example 1, or d) transduction of target patient PBMC directly with recombinant Adenovirus constructs as exemplified by Example 5. This method enabled the identification of single antigens and peptides derived thereof within each stimulatory region with exceedingly stimulating capacity measured by the release of INF\u03b3 as exemplified in FIG. 4.",
                                "Secondly, a directed expression-library was constructed by amplifying full-length C. trachomatis genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using gene-specific oligonucleotides containing a Kozak sequence in the 5\u2032-primer and a stop codon in the 3\u2032-primer. Genomic DNA from C. trachomatis serovar D was used as template for the PCR reactions and a newly developed UNIX program was used for automated primer design including primer position within the gene of interest and Tm. Amplicons were first inserted by recombination into the Gateway \u201centry vector\u201d (Invitrogen) and then transferred by recombination into the pDEST17 expression vector (Invitrogen), which contains a His6-tag and the same recombination sequences as the entry vector. Individual clones were screened for the expression of C. trachomatis antigens by the colony blot method (French maul and maul 1986) using a pool of human serum samples with high levels of C. trachomatis specific IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies. The nitrocellulose filters used for the colony lift had been pre-soaked in 1% arabinose solution in order to induce transcription originating for the plasmid encoded promoter prior to cell lysis. Positive clones which bind to serum IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies from chlamydia patients were selected for further analysis by western blotting using the same pool of serum samples as used for the initial screening. This method led to the identification of clones encoding immunoreactive C. trachomatis proteins of vaccine and diagnostic relevance.",
                                "Thirdly, a genomic expression library was constructed in E. coli phage lambda gt11 (\u03bbgt11). High-molecular-weight chromosomal DNA of C. trachomatis serovar D was extracted from elementary bodies in a lysis buffer containing SDS (1%) and Proteinase K (10 \u03bcg/ml) followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was partially degraded by sonication and DNA fragments of 0.2-0.8 kb in size were ligated into \u03bbgt11. The ligation mixture was packaged in vitro and the recombinant phages were plated on E. coli Y1090r\u2212 yielding a genomic expression library containing approximately 3.4\u00d7105 primary lambda phages. This primary library was amplified to resulting in a genome random expression library with 6.7\u00d7109 PFU/ml. In a first experiment, this library was screened by a plaque-lift method using the same pool of human serum samples as used above for the screening of the full-length expression library. Eighty-eight immuno reactive plaques binding to C. trachomatis-specific IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies were identified. These plaques were pooled into eight pools (two pools of IgA reactive plaques, five pools of IgG reactive plaques and one pool of IgM reactive plaques) and rescreened with the same serum-pool (primary antibody) as used in the initial screening. Individual sero reactive phage plaques were isolated and the sequences of the DNA inserts of individually sero reactive phages were determined. This method identified a several clones encoding specific C. trachomatis immunoreactive peptides of vaccine and diagnostic relevance. Lastly, animal models of the disease have been established in small rodent in order to identify antigens which are recognized by the murine immunesystem during an experimental Chlamydia infection or provides at least partial immunity against a challenge infection. Different chlamydia species exhibit a high degree of specificity towards their natural host. Thus, C. trachomatis serovar D used in the different screening strategies described above is a human pathogen, which does not cause pathological changes in mice as normally associated with the human infection. On the other hand, mice can be experimentally infected with the closely related Chlamydia muridarum MoPn strain, and several researchers have previously demonstrated induction of partial immunity against experimental MoPn infection. A genital infection model has therefore been established and validated in C57 mice. The protective efficacy of different antigens was studied in this model by evaluating 1) bacterial counts by cervical swaps, 2) pathological changes in the genital tract, and 3) cellular in vitro assays for immune reactive cells."

Likewise immunization with rTC0052 also induced a strong release of IFN-\u03b3 in response to the homologous protein (FIG. 12b).

Both rCT521 and rTC0052 induced high levels of protection and the combination of the two proteins had a positive additive effect on protection (FIG. 13).
