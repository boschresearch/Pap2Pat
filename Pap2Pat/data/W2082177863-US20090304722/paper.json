    "abstract": "The human immune response to a Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D lysate was investigated in patients with urogenital C. trachomatis infection, to identify novel T cell targets.A C. trachomatis lysate was fractionated on the basis of molecular mass, and each fraction was used to stimulate peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients with C. trachomatis infection. In frequently recognized fractions, proteins were identified by mass spectrometry, recombinantly expressed, and tested for T cell recognition.T cell recognition of the fractions was highly heterogeneous in patients with C. trachomatis infection (n=16). Four patients exhibited responses that were strongly targeted to antigens of 16-20-kDa molecular mass. Three proteins were identified in this fraction: CT043, CT511, and CT521. The T cell response to the individual recombinant proteins were investigated, and CT521 was found to induce the highest level of interferon (IFN)- gamma. The recognition of CT521 was investigated in a larger study population (n=41), and a positive IFN-gamma response was measured in 83% of the patients. Several T cell epitopes were identified in CT521; in particular, peptide 5 in the central part of the protein was frequently recognized by T cells (63%).We have identified a novel C. trachomatis antigen, CT521, that is frequently recognized in patients with urogenital C. trachomatis infection.",

Of these, 57 patients (23 women and 34 men; mean age, 27) who responded positively to a whole C. trachomatis lysate were selected for further investigation. PBMCs from 16 of these patients were stimulated with the protein fractions, to identify frequently recognized fractions. Results from 4 of the patients are shown here. To investigate the recognition of CT521 in a larger study population, PBMCs from 41 patients (15 women and 26 men; mean age, 26 years) were analyzed. Twenty-four blood donors with no history of positive C. trachomatis testing were enrolled as control subjects (16 women and 8 men; mean age, 31 years).

Patients with C. trachomatis infection from a local district hospital in Copenhagen who responded to a whole C. trachomatis lysate (59%) were enrolled in the study. The specificitie of T cell responses were analyzed by measuring the IFN-g response to 30 narrow protein fractions with a minimal overlap between neighboring fractions (figu e 1). PBMCs from a total of 16 patients were stimulated with the panel of protein fractions (data not shown). The immune responses showed a marked heterogeneity, and in each case the response was directed to multiple fractions. Four of the patients showed a characteristic profil with a preferential recognition of fraction (F) 7, which consisted of molecules of molecular masses between 16-20 kDa (figu e 2A). In all 4 patients, this fraction was 1 of the 2 most powerful inducers of IFN-g. In contrast, the fractionated proteins induced no or only a minimal response by lymphocytes from control subjects (figu e 2B). We therefore decided to focus on this fraction.",
                        "To identify proteins that could be responsible for the T cell stimulatory activity of F7, proteins in this fraction were further separated by SDS-PAGE with a 22-cm-long gel. Under these conditions, \u223c5 bands were detected in F7 by silver staining (data not shown). These 5 bands were excised from the silverstained gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to peptide mass mapping by MALDI MS. The resultant peptide mass maps were matched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant database for identification Three C. trachomatis proteins-CT521, CT511, and CT043, all with molecular masses in the expected size range-were identifie (table 1). CT521 and CT511 are similar to the ribosomal proteins L16 and L15, respectively, whereas the function of CT043 is unknown.",

The products were firs purifie by metal chelate affinit chromatography, followed by elution from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Different concentrations (5, 1.25, and 0.31 mg/mL) of the recombinant proteins were added to PBMCs isolated from the 4 patients with C. trachomatis infection who responded to F7 and from 4 control subjects. Cytokine (IFN-g and IL-4) release was measured by ELISA (figu e 3). Three of the 4 patients responded to rCT521 with an IFN-g level 12000 pg/mL at at least 1 of the antigen concentrations tested; in particular, 2 of the 4 patients responded strongly with high levels of IFN-g (15000 pg/mL). Overall, rCT043 and rCT511 both induced lower levels of IFN-g; however, in 1 patient (patient 2), rCT043 induced a higher level than did rCT521. IL-4 was not detected in any of the culture supernatants (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that CT521 is the antigen responsible for the majority of the observed T cell recognition of F7. chomatis infection. To further investigate the CT521-specifi human immune response elicited by a C. trachomatis urogenital infection, PBMCs collected from 41 patients and 24 control subjects were analyzed for their T cell responses to rCT521 (figu e 4).

With a cutoff level of 23 pg/mL IFN-g (the upper 95% CI of the geometric mean for the control subjects), all peptides were recognized by T cells from at least 2 patients, thereby demonstrating a wide array of T cell epitopes in this molecule (figu e 5A). However, although the responses were heterogeneous, a hierarchy existed, with certain regions being strong targets for the response. Peptide (P) 2 (aa 14-36) and the peptides in the central region (P4-P6, covering aa 40-88), especially, were more dominant than the others. In particular, the peptide present in the central part, aa 53-75 (P5), was frequently recognized by PBMCs from the patients (figu e 5A). P5 was recognized by 23 (68%) of the 34 patients, with a median IFN-g release of 335 pg/mL. In contrast, the IFN-g responses for the control subjects were all !100 pg/mL, and PBMCs from only a few control subjects (10%-20%) responded above the cutoff level (figu e 5B). Two of the patients who responded strongly to rCT521 and P5 were followed for 10 months, to further analyze recognition of CT521 and the individual peptides (figu e 6). The epitope recognition pattern did not change when the patients were studied at consecutive time points before and after treatment-at all 3 time points, P5 was the dominant epitope in both patients. The cellular response to P5 was further characterized by subset depletion in 1 of the patients.

                "Studies aimed at the identificatio of chlamydia proteins relevant for human immunity to C. trachomatis infection are of high priority in the development of a vaccine against the disease. In the present study, we investigated the specificit of human T cell responses to C. trachomatis serovar D proteins by a method in which complex protein mixtures separated by SDS-PAGE are electroeluted into fractions, each of which contains a few protein bands in a physiological buffer [29]. This approach has several advantages over the T cell immunoblotting technique used in previous studies, in which the proteins bands are excised from the nitrocellulose membranes, converted into particles, and added to cell cultures [25,27,36]. First, the exact protein concentration can be determined in each molecularweight fraction, meaning that all fractions can be tested at the same protein concentration and that the T cell stimulatory activity of the different molecular-weight regions can be compared directly. Second, each protein fraction can be subjected to protein chemical analyses, such as protein identificatio by mass fingerprintin and MS sequencing of selected peptides. In the present study, we conducted a detailed analysis of one protein fraction, F7, and this led to the identificatio of CT521 as an antigen that is frequently recognized by patients with C. trachomatis infection.",
                "CT521 has not previously been reported as a target of the human immune response during urogenital C. trachomatis infection. Of the samples from the C. trachomatis patients enrolled in the present study, 83% displayed a T cell response to CT521, compared with 25% of the control samples. Ideally, the responses of patients should be compared with those of nonexposed negative control subjects. Unfortunately, it is difficul to fin suitable control samples, because many individuals may have experienced a subclinical Chlamydia infection or may have had an infection with Chlamydia pneumonia, which is known to induce cross-reactivity against at least some antigens [27]. This could explain the positive response to CT521 observed in at least some of the control samples.",
                "On the basis of sequence similarity, CT521 has been identifie as the ribosomal L16 protein, a structural component of the large ribosomal subunit [32], and CT521 has been detected in both phases of the chlamydial life cycle [37]. The observation that a ribosomal protein is frequently recognized during C. trachomatis infection is in agreement with the finding of previous studies, in which ribosomal proteins from a variety of microorganisms have been characterized as major antigens. Moreover, a number of ribosomal proteins have been dem-onstrated to induce at least partial protection in animal models of the respective diseases [38][39][40]. Because ribosomal proteins are expected to be predominantly located in the bacterial cytoplasm, CT521 may be accessible to antigen-presenting cells and, thus, presented to CD4 + T cells after it is released by infected epithelial cells. Alternatively, it might be speculated that CT521 could access the host cell cytosol (through the type III secretion system) and thereby act as an antigen for CD8 + T cells. Irrespective of how and when CT521 is presented to the human immune system during the chlamydial life cycle, bacterial proteins that are predominantly associated with the cytoplasm have been found to be immunodominant during the course of a natural C. trachomatis infection, as exemplifie by hsp60 [41].",
                "CT521 appears to elicit a predominantly Th1 immune response that is characterized by high levels of IFN-g and undetectable levels of IL-4. However, in contrast to other known C. trachomatis T cell antigens, such as MOMP, OMP2, and hsp60 [42][43][44][45], CT521 appears to be targeted exclusively to the cell-mediated-immunity arm of the immune response. None of the patients with C. trachomatis infection in the present study had a detectable level of serum IgG antibodies against CT521. Epitope-mapping experiments revealed several distinct epitopes in CT521, with the P5 epitope (aa 53-75) being recognized by PBMCs from 68% (23/34) of the patients. Several CD4 + T cell epitopes have previously been mapped in C. trachomatis antigens, such as MOMP [22,23], OMP2 [27], hsp60 [24], and Hc1 [25]. However, in contrast to the present study, in which we used polyclonal T cell populations, these previous studies used T cell clones from a few patients. To our knowledge, this is therefore the firs report of a single epitope being recognized by 63% of patients with C. trachomatis infection responding to a C. trachomatis lysate. Interestingly, the epitope recognition pattern remained constant in patients for up to 10 months after the primary samples had been tested, which contrasts with observations for certain viral diseases in which the epitope recognition pattern changes over time [46].",
                "Although the possible role played by CT521-specifi T cell responses remains to be investigated, a reasonable precondition for even considering an antigen to confer protection is its frequent recognition by a heterogeneous human population, thereby demonstrating both in vivo expression and presentation by the human major histocompatibility complex. Administered in an optimized delivery system and devoid of other less relevant or even detrimental immune responses raised during natural infection, this component may, therefore, provide a potential starting point for a novel subunit vaccine. Furthermore, the CT521 protein is an attractive vaccine candidate because it is abundantly expressed during bacterial growth and is highly conserved between different Chlamydia serovariants.",
                "In conclusion, we have identifie a novel C. trachomatis an-tigen, CT521, that is frequently recognized in patients with urogenital C. trachomatis infection. Ongoing studies in animal models will determine the protective value of the protein."
