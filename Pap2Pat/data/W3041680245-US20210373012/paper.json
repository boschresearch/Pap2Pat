    "abstract": "The polyhistidine tag (His-tag) is one of the most popular protein tags used in the life sciences. Traditionally, the detection of His-tagged proteins relies on immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies. This approach is laborious for certain applications, such as protein purification, where time and simplicity are critical. The His-tag can also be directly detected by metal ion-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based chelator heads conjugated to fluorophores, which is a convenient alternative method to immunoblotting. Typically, such chelator heads are conjugated to either green or red fluorophores, the detection of which requires specialized excitation sources and detection systems. Here, we demonstrate that post-run staining is ideal for His-tag detection by metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in PAGE and blot membranes. Additionally, by comparing the performances of different chelator heads, we show how differences in microscopic affinity constants translate to macroscopic differences in the detection limits in environments with limited diffusion, such as PAGE. On the basis of these results, we devise a simple approach, called UVHis-PAGE, that uses metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads to detect His-tagged proteins in PAGE and blot membranes. Our method uses a UV transilluminator as an excitation source, and the results can be visually inspected by the naked eye.",

However, given the lack of sensitivity of the chelator heads to the His6-tag under pre-run staining conditions (17), an alternative staining procedure that allows and maximizes the detection of His6-tagged proteins must be optimized first."

                        "We hypothesized that reducing the harsh conditions of SDS-PAGE during the initial incubation and complex migration in the pre-run staining protocol (17) can increase the detection performance of a given chelator head. To evaluate this hypothesis, we implemented a post-run staining protocol (Fig. 1) that enabled us to compare the detection limit of Ni2+-monoNTA- and Ni2+-trisNTA-coupled fluorophores directly. As a target protein for detection, we used a His6-SUMO fusion protein which bears a single His6-tag at the N terminus and is >95% pure (Fig. S2a). Therefore, any amount of protein described in moles will correspond to the same amount of His6. Moreover, we preferred this protein fusion because of its relatively small size, which minimizes the chance of unspecific binding.",
                        "We mixed various amounts (0.1\u201325 pmol) of His6-SUMO with SDS-PAGE electrophoresis sample buffer, which we heated to 95\u00b0C and ran on 10% SDS-PAGE, as described under \u201cExperimental procedures.\u201d Each sample was prepared as a double loading volume (30 \u00b5l) and then split into two independent gels. This procedure was repeated four times, once for each of the tested Ni2+-loaded fluorophore-chelator head conjugates: Ni2+-monoNTAAtto550, Ni2+-trisNTACy3B, Ni2+-monoNTAAtto647N, and Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa647. One copy of each gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted overnight with commercial anti-His antibody and imaged with chemiluminescence (first rows in Fig. 3, a\u2013d). This immunoblotting step served a 2-fold purpose. First, it ensured that equal amounts of His6-SUMO were loaded on each of the four replicated gels. Second, it illustrated the detection limit of typical anti-His antibody\u2013based chemiluminescent immunoblotting as \u223c0.1 pmol (first rows in Fig. 3, a\u2013d).",
                        "The second copy of each of the four gels was fixed using the fast protocol (12 min) described under \u201cExperimental procedures.\u201d After fixing and washing the gels, the protocol proceeded directly to the staining step. Alternatively, the fixed gel can be stored in water for staining in the future with minimal diffusion of the bands (Fig. 1). For the gel staining step, fresh PBS solutions containing 150 nm Ni2+-monoNTAAtto647N, Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa647, 300 nm of Ni2+-monoNTAAtto550, or Ni2+-trisNTACy3B were prepared. The gels were submerged in these solutions, and staining was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking in the dark.",
                        "After completion of the staining step, the gels were rinsed with water to remove the excess staining solution. In the initial trials, the gels were imaged immediately, which resulted in an excessive background, especially given the high sensitivity of the laser-based Typhoon scanner (data not shown). To remove the unbound fluorophore conjugates and reduce the background, we submerged the gels in warm water (warm water facilitates the diffusion of the unbound fluorophore conjugates out of the gels) and gently shook them in the dark for 30, 60, or 90 min. After each 30-min washing cycle, the gels were imaged using the same Typhoon imaging conditions with an appropriate excitation source and emission filters, depending on the conjugated fluorophore.",
                        "After the first destaining and imaging cycle (30 min), both Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates exhibited a His6-SUMO detection limit of \u223c0.1 pmol (Fig. 3, b and d). In contrast, the Ni2+-monoNTA conjugates were considerably less sensitive, with a detection limit of only \u223c2.5 pmol (Fig. 3, a and c). Thus, the Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates were \u223c25-fold more sensitive than Ni2+-monoNTA conjugates. We further validated these detection limits by replacing His6-SUMO with N terminus His6-tagged human PCNA (its monomer has higher molecular mass (\u223c30 kDa) than His6-SUMO, and this monomer forms an oligomer (homotrimer) in solution) and staining the PCNA-containing gels with Ni2+-trisNTACy3B or Ni2+- monoNTAAtto550 (Fig. S2, b and c). Each additional 30-min destaining step caused the loss of detection of the last previous band for both Ni2+-trisNTA and Ni2+-monoNTA conjugates. Nevertheless, from a quantitative point of view, this translated into the loss of only \u223c0.15\u20130.5 pmol/30 min for Ni2+-trisNTA and \u223c1\u20135 pmol/30 min for Ni2+-monoNTA. Therefore, in addition to the increased detection sensitivity, Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates also exhibited a \u223c10-fold increase in stability over time. Overall, these results demonstrate that the post-run protocol improved the detection by Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates to a level that matches the limit of typical anti-His antibody\u2013based chemiluminescent immunoblotting (Table S2)."

                        "Equipped with the above-established highly sensitive detection provided by the post-run staining conditions, we next turned our attention to the choice of fluorophore for building a UV-based detection system for His6-tagged proteins. Typical UV transilluminators offer a very limited number of wavelength choices, such as 302 and 365 nm. With these considerations, by surveying the absorption spectra, molecular extinction coefficients, and quantum yields of commercially available UV-excitable fluorophores with visible emission, we chose Alexa Fluor 405. At 365 nm, this fluorophore retains \u223c68% of its maximum molar extinction coefficient (Fig. 2b). Moreover, Alexa Fluor 405 is directly available as NHS ester for the convenience of coupling to the amine-containing chelator heads. However, Alexa Fluor 405 exhibits a relatively low brightness, which is typical for small organic UV and near-UV fluorophores (Fig. 2c and Table S1).",
                        "We proceeded to determine the detection limit of His6-tagged in SDS-PAGE and blotting membrane using Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405. The samples were prepared as described in the previous section, but in the His6-SUMO amount range of 1\u20131000 pmol. Each sample was prepared as a double loading volume (30 \u00b5l) and then split into two independent gels. One copy of the gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and blocked with BSA for 1 h, and the second was fixed using the fast protocol (12 min). After rinsing, both the gel and the membrane can be either stained immediately or stored for future staining (Fig. 1).",
                        "For the staining step, both the gel and the membrane were treated identically. The gel and the membrane were submerged into fresh PBS solution containing 2 \u03bcm Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 and then they were submerged in this solution and incubated for 1 h in the dark with gentle shaking. After 1 h, the gel was rinsed with warm water and the membrane was rinsed with 1 \u00d7 TBST and exposed to a UV transilluminator equipped with a protective screen. To capture an image as similar as possible to the one available to the naked eye, we photographed both the gel and the membrane with a regular cellphone camera in the dark (Fig. 4, c and e). For accuracy, we also took images with the integrated camera of the FluorChem Q Image analysis system (Fig. 4, d and f).",
                        "With this simple approach, a detection limit of \u223c5 pmol for the gel and \u223c2.5 pmol for the membrane were visible to the naked eye through the protective screen of the UV transilluminator (Fig. 4, c and e). These detection limits were also confirmed by the camera of the FluorChem Q Image analysis system (Fig. 4, d and f). Remarkably, these detection limits were achieved without the need for any additional time-consuming destaining steps, despite the relatively low brightness of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 (Fig. 2c and Table S1) and the simplicity of the equipment involved. The membrane was easily visualized using the UV transilluminator and the naked eye, even under ambient light conditions (Fig. 4g). Moreover, at the end of the visualization, the gel could be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) for complementarity (Fig. 4, a and b). By using the fast staining protocol described under \u201cExperimental procedures,\u201d CBB in its G-250 form allowed \u223c1 pmol of His6-SUMO to be visualized. In the case of the blotting membrane, washing in the presence of at least 50 mm EDTA removed the bound Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405, thus allowing the membrane to be reused for future experiments (data not shown).",
                        "To quantitatively assess the correlation between the CBB and Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 detection, we measured the band intensities in the gels and the membrane by using the built-in function of the ImageJ software. We then normalized these values to the intensity of the 1000 pmol band in the corresponding gel or membrane (Fig. S3). The intensities of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 in both the gel and membrane scaled very accurately with the CBB intensities in the gel, with a correlation coefficient higher than 99%. From a practical point of view, this high correlation indicates excellent complementarity of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 and CBB staining within the given detection range of 5\u2013500 pmol."

                        "In complex mixture samples, especially in whole cellular extracts, a variety of different proteins can show different affinities toward His-tag\u2013binding reagents, such as anti-His antibodies and metal ion\u2013loaded chelator heads (23\u201327). Therefore, we investigated the specificity of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 in the UVHis-PAGE approach for detecting His6-SUMO in Escherichia coli extract. We prepared uninduced and induced samples as a double loading volume (30 \u00b5l) and then split them into two independent gels. One copy of the gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked with BSA for 1 h, immunoblotted for 2 h with anti-His antibody, and imaged with chemiluminescence (Fig. 5b). The second copy of the gel was fixed using the fast protocol (12 min). The gel was then stained with Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 as described above and imaged both with a regular cellphone camera and with the camera of the FluorChem Q Image analysis system (Fig. 5c). After imaging, the same gel was stained with CBB, as described previously (Fig. 5a). A clear additional band at \u223c15 kDa was visible in the induced sample relative to the uninduced sample, which corresponds to His6-SUMO. The presence of the His-tag was directly confirmed by the antibody-based immunoblotting (Fig. 5b). The Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 signal was highly specific to the confirmed His6-SUMO band under both imaging methods. Notably, no additional unspecific bands could be visualized either by the naked eye or by the camera of the analysis system. These experiments clearly illustrate the high specificity of detection of the Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 in the UVHis-PAGE approach, even in complex mixture samples."

This method allows for the visualization of His6-tagged protein using a simple UV transilluminator as the excitation source and the naked eye as the detector, down to amounts as low as 5 pmol in SDS-PAGE or 2.5 pmol in blot membrane. This approach uses a Ni2+-loaded NTA-based chelator head and a UV-excitable fluorophore with visible emission, which were carefully chosen.",
                "Amine-terminated monoNTA (3, 4) and trisNTA (5\u20139) (Fig. 2a) represent two popular and commercially available chelator heads that can be directly used for coupling to NHS ester fluorophores. trisNTA loaded with Ni2+ has been previously optimized to enhance its binding affinity to His6-tags by 1000-fold as compared with that of Ni2+-monoNTA (8). Therefore, our first set of experiments was designed to directly evaluate the performance of these two Ni2+-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in the SDS-PAGE detection of His6-tagged proteins. A complete lack of detection was previously shown when Ni2+-trisNTA was employed in a pre-run staining protocol (17). Ni2+-loaded hexaNTA is the only known chelator head that can withstand the harsh conditions of the pre-run staining protocol (17). Thus, we switched to a post-run staining protocol (Fig. 1) to directly compare Ni2+-monoNTA and Ni2+-trisNTA.",
                "Compared with Ni2+-monoNTA conjugates, Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates resulted in a \u223c25-fold increase in the detection sensitivity of His6-SUMO (Fig. 3). In fact, as per the manufacturer's description, the Atto dyes that were attached to Ni2+-monoNTA are brighter than their Alexa or cyanine counterparts that were attached to Ni2+-trisNTA, which makes this result even more remarkable. On a theoretical level, this result also shows that in complex environments, such as in and out of gel diffusion, a several-fold difference in the affinity constant does not necessarily directly translate into the same -fold difference in the detection limit. Nevertheless, given this considerable enhancement, we chose trisNTA for the subsequent experiments.",
                "The detection limit of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa647 of \u223c0.1 pmol in post-run staining conditions was similar to that of Ni2+-hexaNTAAlexa647 (\u223c0.2 pmol) in pre-run staining conditions (17). This similarity opens two potential directions for further investigation. First, this detection limit may be imposed by the conjugated fluorophore itself rather than by the chelator head, a case in which brighter small organic fluorophores should be developed and coupled to these chelator heads to enhance the detection sensitivity. This possibility is also sustained by directly comparing the detection limit of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa647 (Fig. 3d) (\u223c0.1 pmol) with Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa405 (Fig. 4, c and d) (\u223c5 pmol), which, despite using the same chelator head, resulted in a \u223c50-fold difference in favor of the brighter Alexa Fluor 647 and the more advanced instrumentation used for its visualization (Fig. 2c and Table S1). Alternatively, because Ni2+-hexaNTA is \u223c1000-fold stronger binder than Ni2+-trisNTA (16) but these two Ni2+-loaded MCHs resulted in a similar detection limit (when used under pre-run (for Ni2+-hexaNTA) and post-run (for Ni2+-trisNTA) staining conditions, respectively), it is possible that any chelator head may not be used at its maximum capacity under SDS-PAGE pre-run staining conditions. This possibility is also sustained by the completely different behavior of Ni2+-trisNTAAlexa647 under post-run staining conditions in the current study and under the pre-run staining conditions described previously (17).",
                "In addition to the theoretical advantage of directly comparing the staining kinetics using different fluorophore-coupled chelator heads, post-run staining conditions offer several further advantages, as well as a drawback, when compared with pre-run staining conditions. For instance, because trisNTA can be employed, post-run staining conditions allow for the efficient detection of the most common form of His-tag, His6, in SDS-PAGE. Moreover, because the complex is formed post-run, post-run staining conditions do not induce an undesired upper shift in the apparent molecular weight of the protein of interest. Lastly, the post-run staining conditions protocol allows for gel fixation and later staining without the requirement for immediate imaging. However, this protocol consumes larger amounts of Ni2+-trisNTA conjugates in the staining step. Nevertheless, both protocols perform similarly well, with a detection limit similar to that of antibody-based chemiluminescent immunoblotting. A comparison of the detection limits and required instrumentation for different His-tag detection assays in PAGE and blotting membranes is summarized in Table S2.",
                "Next, we focused on increasing the ease of detection by changing the fluorophore to Alexa Fluor 405. This dye is UV-excitable and exhibits fluorescence emission in the visible part of the spectrum (Fig. 2b). Typical detection usually employs green or red fluorophores, which require specialized excitation sources and detection systems. By coupling Alexa Fluor 405 with Ni2+-trisNTA, we were able to detect amounts of His6-SUMO as low as 5 pmol for SDS-PAGE or 2.5 pmol in blotting membrane using a simple UV transilluminator as the excitation source and the naked eye as the detector. This method of detection showed excellent correlation with the CBB staining method (Fig. 4 and Fig. S3) and was highly specific to the His-tagged protein, even in complex mixture samples (Fig. 5). These results are particularly remarkable in the context of the reduced brightness of UV-excitable dyes such as Alexa Fluor 405, as well as their strong quenching upon conjugation to Ni2+-trisNTA (Fig. 2c and Table S1). Therefore, in the future, such simplified UV excitation\u2013based detection systems with naked-eye visualization could significantly improve with the development of brighter small organic fluorophores that have considerable UV excitation and visible emission.",
                "In conclusion, UVHis-PAGE can be an ideal tool for the rapid and straightforward detection of His-tagged proteins in applications where specialized fluorescence detection is unavailable or traditional antibody-based immunoblotting is too costly or time-consuming. Apart from indicating the presence of a particular epitope, immunoblotting with secondary antibodies, based on both chemiluminescent (28, 29) and fluorescent (28, 30, 31) detection, has been used as a quantitative tool to determine the epitope amount. For a given set of conditions, such as gel percentage and composition or blotting membrane composition, the type and concentration of Ni2+-MCH conjugate used, the staining and destaining times, and the imaging parameters, we envision that our methods can also be used as quantitative tools, mainly through the use of a calibration curve similar to the dependence described in Fig. S3. For the methods presented here, all the necessary chemical components are commercially available and, through the use of the well-established amine-NHS chemistry, require uncomplicated experimental conditions for efficient coupling. To clarify the required amount of reagents for implementing our methods, we summarized the starting amount of materials and the final yields, volumes, and concentrations for the three Ni2+-loaded trisNTA conjugates in Table S3. In a broader sense, the current work also highlights the benefits of using UV-excitable dyes in various assays, which, despite their lower brightness, can offer a simple platform for detection because of the simplified equipment requirements."

After the transfer, the membranes were washed once with 1\u00d7 TBST. The membranes were then blocked for 1 h while shaking at room temperature using 5% (w/v) BSA dissolved in 1\u00d7 TBST. Following that, the membranes were washed once with 1\u00d7 TBST. Then, they were incubated with the anti-histidine tag antibody (Bio-Rad, MCA1396) at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml for the indicated amount of time, depending on the experiment, as described under \u201cResults.\u201d The proteins were then washed with 1\u00d7 TBST three times for 5 min each. Next, the membranes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature while shaking with the anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 7076) at a concentration of 0.1 \u03bcg/ml. Finally, the membranes were washed three times for 5 min each and incubated for 2 min with the chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Thermo Fisher, 34080) before imaging."
