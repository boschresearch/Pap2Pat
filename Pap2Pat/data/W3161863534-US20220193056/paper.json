    "title": "Nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 promotes tumorigenesis of PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancer",
    "date": "2021-05-05",
    "abstract": "PI3Ks consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 regulatory subunits. PIK3CA, encoding p110\uf061, is frequently mutated in human cancers. Most PIK3CA mutations are clustered in the helical domain or the kinase domain. Here, we report that p85\uf062 disassociates from p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant protein and translocates into the nucleus through a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). Nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits deubiquitinase USP7 to stabilize EZH1 and EZH2 and enhances H3K27 trimethylation. Knockout of p85\u03b2 or p85\u03b2 NLS mutant reduces the growth of tumors harboring a PIK3CA helical domain mutation. Our studies illuminate a novel mechanism by which PIK3CA helical domain mutations exert their oncogenic function. Finally, a combination of Alpelisib, a p110\u03b1-specific inhibitor, and an EZH inhibitor, Tazemetostat, induces regression of xenograft tumors harboring a PIK3CA helical domain mutation, but not tumors with either a WT PIK3CA or a PIK3CA kinase domain mutation, suggesting that the drug combination could be an effective therapeutic approach for PIK3CA helical domain mutant tumors.",

                "PIK3CA, which encodes the p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit of PI3 kinase, is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers1\u20133. Recently, the FDA approved the combination of p110\u03b1-specific inhibitor Alpelisib and the estrogen receptor antagonist Fulvestrant to treat PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer patients whose tumors are hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative4. This approval highlights mutant PIK3CA (encoding p110\u03b1 protein) as a critical cancer drug target and the importance of further understanding the molecular mechanisms by which PIK3CA mutations drive tumorigenesis. PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit5. Normally, the p85 subunits bind and stabilize the p110 subunit and inhibit its enzymatic activity6. Upon growth factor stimulation, the SH2 domains of p85 bind to the phospho-tyrosine residues on receptor protein kinases or adaptor proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which activates PI3K and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)5. PIP3 recruits pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins, including PDK1 and AKTs, to the cell membrane to activate signaling pathways5.",
                "Most tumor-derived PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots in p110\u03b1 protein: the E542, E545, and Q546 residues in the helical domain and the H1047 residue in the kinase domain1,7. Accumulating evidence suggests that the helical domain mutations and kinase domain mutations exert their oncogenic functions through distinct molecular mechanisms. p110\u03b1 helical domain mutations alleviate the inhibitory interaction between p110\u03b1 and the N-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) of p85\u03b1 and \u03b2, and facilitate direct interaction of p110\u03b1 with IRS18\u201312. The E545K helical domain mutation in p110\u03b1 does not increase lipid kinase activity in response to phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase or adaptor proteins8,10\u201312. Moreover, the p110\u03b1 E545K helical domain mutant requires the Ras-binding domain to transform chicken embryonic fibroblasts13, whereas the H1047R kinase domain mutant requires the p85-binding domain. Phenotypically, breast cancer cells expressing a PIK3CA helical domain mutation showed more severe metastatic phenotypes than that of wild-type or PIK3CA H1047R mutation in an isogenic background14. Furthermore, patients with a PIK3CA H1047R mutation have a better response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors than patients with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation in early phase clinical trials15,16.",
                "The regulatory subunits of PI3K p85\u03b1 (encoded by PIK3R1) and p85\u03b2 (encoded by PIK3R2) are ubiquitously expressed, but they seem to play opposite roles in tumorigenesis17. Loss-of-function mutations of p85\u03b1 frequently occur in endometrial and brain cancers18,19, suggesting that it normally functions as a tumor suppressor20,21. In contrast, p85\u03b2 often is overexpressed in diverse cancers and depletion of p85\u03b2 impairs tumor formation in vivo and in vitro22\u201326, suggesting that it plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, several studies have demonstrated that p85 proteins can regulate biological processes through nuclear translocation27\u201331. It has been shown that p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 interact with nuclear Bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7) and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) to regulate glucose homeostasis30,31. However, it remains unknown whether nuclear p85 proteins play an important role in tumorigenesis.",
                "Here we show that p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, disassociates from p110\u03b1 and translocates into the nucleus in cancer cells with a p110\u03b1 helical domain mutation, thereby promoting tumor growth. The nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits deubiquitinase USP7 to stabilize histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 and enhances histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3). Moreover, we demonstrate that a combination of Alpelisib and an EZH inhibitor, Tazemetostat, induces regression of xenograft tumors harboring a PIK3CA helical domain mutation, but not tumors with either a WT PIK3CA or a PIK3CA kinase domain mutation."

                        "We previously demonstrated that p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins (e.g. E545K) gain direct interaction with IRS1 independent of p85\u03b1 and \u03b2, thereby rewiring oncogenic signaling12. To gain insights into how the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutations impact PI3K complex formation, we immunoprecipitated either wild-type (WT) p110\u03b1 or p110\u03b1 E545K mutant protein in cell lines with the WT or mutant endogenous p110\u03b1 proteins tagged with 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009FLAG [12, Fig.\u00a01a]. Interestingly, compared to the WT p110\u03b1 protein, the p110\u03b1 E545K protein drastically reduced its binding to p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1 (Fig.\u00a01b and S1a). This observation was further validated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation of either p85\u03b2 or p85\u03b1 in isogenic DLD1 cell lines with either WT-only (PIK3CA E545K allele knockout) or E545K-only (PIK3CA WT allele knockout, Fig.\u00a01c, d and S1b, c). We postulated that some of the p85\u03b2 proteins might disassociate from the PI3K complexes in PIK3CA E545K mutant cells. Indeed, immunoprecipitation with both p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 in the isogenic DLD1 E545K-only and WT-only cells showed more PI3K complex-free (post-IP) p85\u03b2 were present in the E545K-only cells than in the WT-only cells (Figure\u00a0S1d). These results were further validated by gel-filtration analyses (Figure\u00a0S1e).Fig. 1p85\u03b2 disassociates from the p110\u03b1 helical domain-mutant protein.a Schematic of DLD1 isogenic cell lines.

                        "Tumor-derived PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots: one in the helical domain at E542, E545, Q546, and the other in the kinase domain at the H1047 site. We set out to determine which mutations in p110\u03b1 affect binding to p85\u03b2. As shown in Fig.\u00a01e, f and S1f, as with the p110\u03b1 E545K mutant, the p110\u03b1 E542K and Q546K mutant proteins disrupted their interactions with p85\u03b2 compared to the WT p110\u03b1. In contrast, the kinase domain p110\u03b1 H1047R mutant protein had no impact on p85\u03b2 binding. Neither did other relatively rare p110\u03b1 mutant proteins including R88Q and K111N in the ABD domain, N345K and C420R in the C2 domain, M1043I and G1049R in the kinase domain (Figs.\u00a01e, f, and S1f).",
                        "We then used nine different cell lines to assess p85\u03b2-p110 complex formation. Consistently, the interaction between p85\u03b2 and p110\u03b1 were weaker in four cell lines with PIK3CA helical domain mutation (DLD1, H460, MB361, and SW948) than in either two cell lines with wild-type PIK3CA (SW480 and LoVo) or three cell lines with PIK3CA H1047R mutation (HCT116, T47D, and RKO) (Fig.\u00a01g, h and Fig.\u00a0S1g, i). In contrast, the interactions between p85\u03b2 and p110\u03b2 or between p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b1 were similar in these nine cell lines (Fig.\u00a01g, h and Fig.\u00a0S1g, i). Together, our data suggest that the p85\u03b2 protein dissociates from the mutant p110\u03b1 in cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation."

A protein sequence alignment showed that the SH3 domain, GAP domain, and link region between the GAP and nSH2 domains in the N-terminus sequences between p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 are less conserved (56% identical, Fig.\u00a01i). In contrast, the three SH2 domains in the two proteins\u2019 C-terminus are highly conserved (91% identical, Fig.\u00a01i). We postulated that the N-terminus sequences of p85\u03b2 might cause its disassociation from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins. To this end, we constructed two chimeric p85 proteins that swapped the N-terminus regions of p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a01i). As shown in Fig.\u00a01j, the N-terminal p85\u03b1-C-terminal p85\u03b2 chimeric proteins bound similarly to both p110\u03b1 WT and E545K mutant proteins, whereas the N-terminal p85\u03b2-C-terminal p85\u03b1 chimeric protein bound to less p110\u03b1 E545K mutant protein compared to the WT counterpart (Fig.\u00a01j).

We chose to analyze the following four TCGA datasets because PIK3CA is frequently mutated, and PIK3R2 is overexpressed in these tumor types: colorectal cancer (COAD), bladder carcinoma (BLCA), endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and breast cancer (BRCA) (Fig.\u00a0S2a). Because the number of patients whose tumors harbor PIK3CA mutations is small in each tumor type, we combined the TCGA data of the four tumor types together and divided the patients into three groups according to the PIK3CA mutation status: helical domain mutation group, non-helical domain mutation group, and wild-type group. Interestingly, high expression of PIK3R2 was found to be significantly associated with poor five-year survival only in the helical domain mutation group (HR\u2009=\u20092.146, 95% CI 1.162~3.96, p\u2009=\u20090.0148), but not in the non-helical domain mutation group (HR\u2009=\u20090.9126, 95% CI 0.5714~1.4, p\u2009=\u20090.7017) or wild-type group (HR\u2009=\u20090.9325, 95% CI 0.7404~1.1, p\u2009=\u20090.5527) (Fig.\u00a02a).

COAD, BLCA, UCEC, and BRAC datasets were downloaded from TGCA and combined. Patients were divided into three groups according to their PIK3CA mutation status: Helical domain mutations, Non-helical domain mutations, and wild-type.

We thus performed immunofluorescent staining of p85\u03b2 in the isogenic DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only and PIK3CA WT-only cell lines. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a and Fig.\u00a0S3c, p85\u03b2 was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells, but only in the cytoplasm in the DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells. The specificity of the anti-p85\u03b2 antibody was demonstrated by the lack of staining in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 knockout cells (Fig.\u00a03a). Consistently, cell fractionation analyses showed that significantly more p85\u03b2 was located in the nucleus in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells (Fig.\u00a03b, c). In agreement with previous reports, a small fraction of p85\u03b1 was also present in the nucleus (Fig.\u00a03b), although the amounts of nuclear p85\u03b1 were similar between the isogenic DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells and DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells (Fig.\u00a03c).

                        "To assess the generality and specificity of p85\u03b2 nuclear localization in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cells, we analyzed cellular localization of p85\u03b2 in a panel of cell lines: two additional PIK3CA E545K mutant cell lines (H460 and MB361) and a PIK3CA E542K helical domain mutant cell line SW948; three PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells lines (HCT116, RKO, and T47D); and two WT PIK3CA cell lines (SW480 and LoVo). Both immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation demonstrated that p85\u03b2 was translocated into the nucleus in the cell lines with a PIK3CA E545K mutation, but not in cell lines with WT PIK3CA or H1047R mutation (Fig.\u00a03d\u2013j). Furthermore, overexpressing PIK3CA E545K protein into SW480 cells facilitates the nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0S3e). Consistently, immunohistochemistry staining of human colon cancer specimens showed that p85\u03b2 was predominantly localized in the nuclei of tumors with a PIK3CA E545K mutation (Fig.\u00a0S3g), but mostly localized in the cytoplasm of tumors with wild-type PIK3CA or a PIK3CA H1047R mutation (Fig.\u00a0S3g). Last, live-cell imaging also showed that p85\u03b2-mCherry initially co-localized with p110\u03b1 E545K-GFP (yellow color), then dissociated from the mutant p110 E545K-GFP and translocated into the nucleus (supplementary video\u00a01, Fig.\u00a0S3h), whereas p85\u03b2-mCherry did not dissociate from WT p110\u03b1-GFP (supplementary video\u00a02, Fig.\u00a0S3h) or p110\u03b1 H1047R-GFP fusion protein (supplementary video\u00a03, Fig.\u00a0S3h). Together, those data suggest that p85\u03b2 dissociates from the PI3K complexes and translocates into the nucleus in cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation."

                        "To determine how p85\u03b2 translocates into the nucleus, we exploited a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) prediction tool (cNLS Mapper) and identified a putative NLS at amino acids 474 to 484 of p85\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a04a). To test if this NLS mediates nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2, we first fused the NLS sequence with GFP and showed that the p85\u03b2NLS-GFP was localized only in the nucleus (Figure\u00a0S4a). In contrast, the p85\u03b2NLSKR-AA-GFP, in which the two basic amino acids K477 and R478 in the NLS were mutated to alanine, was diffused in cells just as the GFP alone (Fig.\u00a0S4a). We then reconstituted the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells with HA-tagged WT p85\u03b2, or mutant p85\u03b2 construct (Fig.\u00a0S4b). Although both the WT and K477A/R478A mutant p85\u03b2 bound similarly to WT p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2, immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation showed that the WT p85\u03b2 translocated into the nucleus, but the K477A/R478A mutant p85\u03b2 remained in the cytoplasm (Figures\u00a0S4c, d). Interestingly, reconstitution of the WT, but not the mutant p85\u03b2, rescued the defects in cell growth and colony formation of the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells (Figs.\u00a0S4e, f). As expected, both WT and the mutant p85\u03b2 reduced their interactions with p110\u03b1 E545K mutant protein, but retained the interactions with p110\u03b1 H1047R mutant protein and p110\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0S4b, g). To further validate this observation, we generated p85\u03b2 K477A/R478A mutant knockin (KI) in DLD1 parental cells, which harbor a PIK3CA E545K mutation, using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing (Fig.\u00a04b). Two independently-derived homozygous KI clones termed p85\u03b2KR-AA were chosen for in-depth analyses. The p85\u03b2KR-AA mutation did not impact levels of itself, p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, and AKT phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a04c), suggesting that the p85\u03b2 NLS mutant does not affect the kinase activity of PI3K. Nonetheless, the NLS mutant p85\u03b2KR-AA failed to translocate into the nucleus (Fig.\u00a04d). Moreover, p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant KI cell lines displayed reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth (Fig.\u00a04e\u2013g). Together, those data suggest that nuclear but not cytoplasmic p85\u03b2 promotes the growth of cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.Fig. 4Nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 is critical for the tumorigenicity of PIK3CA E545K mutant cells.a A predicted Nuclear Localization Sequence (NLS) in p85\u03b2 protein is highlighted in blue.

                        "We postulated that the nuclear p85\u03b2 might regulate gene expression. Thus, we performed RNA-seq analyses of DLD1 parental cells and p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells. Compared with the parental cells, expression levels of 3,224 genes were up-regulated, and 2,044 genes were down-regulated in the p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells (Fig.\u00a05a). Interestingly, many of the well-known tumor suppressor genes, such as APC, ATM, BRCA1/2, SMAD4, were up-regulated in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells (Fig.\u00a0S5a, b). These data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2 might regulate global gene transcription. We thus examined histone modifications in parental cells and p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant clones. As shown in Fig.\u00a05b, levels of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) were reduced in the two p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant clones compared to the parental DLD1 cells (Fig.\u00a05b). Consistently, levels of H3K27me3 were higher in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the isogenic PIK3CA WT-only cells (Fig.\u00a05c). Moreover, knockout of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells decreased the levels of H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a05c), whereas knockout of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells had no impact on H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a05c). In contrast, knockout of p85\u03b2 did not affect histone trimethylation at other sites, including H3K4, H3K9, H3K36, and H3K76 in either DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only or DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells (Fig.\u00a05c). Furthermore, the reconstitution of WT p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant, in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells restored the levels of H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a0S5c). To assess the generality of those observations, we knocked down p85\u03b2 in three additional PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines (H460, MB-361, and SW948) and showed that knockdown of p85\u03b2 in those cell lines reduced the levels of H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a05d). In contrast, knockdown of p85\u03b2 in cell lines with a WT PIK3CA (SW480) or a PIK3CA H1047R mutation (HCT116, RKO, and T47D) did not impact the levels of H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a05e). Taken together, the data suggest that nuclear p85\u03b2 modulates H3K27me3, a marker for transcriptional repression.Fig. 5Nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1/EZH2 and enhances H3K27me3 to regulate gene expression.a A heat map of RNA-seq analyses of DLD1 parental cells and p85\u03b2 NLS mutant (p85\u03b2KR-AA KI) cells. b\u2013e Nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 and increases histone H3K27 methylation in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cells, but not in PIK3CA WT or H1047R mutant cells.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05b, compared to parental cells, levels of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins were markedly reduced in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant knockin clones. Consistently, levels of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins were higher in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the isogenic PIK3CA WT-only cells (Fig.\u00a05c). The depletion of p85\u03b2 decreased EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines, including H460, MB-361, and SW948 (Fig.\u00a05d).

Conversely, the reconstitution of WT p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant, in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells restored EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels (Fig.\u00a0S5c). Notably, the knockout of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells did not impact the mRNA expression of EZH1 and EZH2 (Fig.\u00a0S5d). Consistently, the half-life times of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins were reduced in p85\u03b2 KO cells compared to the parental counterparts (Fig.\u00a0S5e, f). It is worth noting that the knockout of p85\u03b2 did not impact other components of the PRC2 complex (Fig.\u00a05c).

As shown in Fig.\u00a05, compared to the parental DLD1 cells, the binding of H3K27me3 was reduced in approximately half of the chromatin regions in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells (Fig.\u00a05f). Specific analysis of the promoter regions showed that promoter-associated H3K27me3 in 383 genes were decreased in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells compared to the parental counterpart. Integrated analyses with the RNA-seq data indicated that the promoter regions of 38 genes (Table\u00a0S1), whose RNA expression levels were up-regulated in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells compared to parental DLD1 cells, had less enrichment for H3K27me3 in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells than in parental DLD1 cells. We chose to validate DLG2 because it is the top-ranked gene among the 38 genes. Moreover, DLG2 has been shown to have tumor suppressor function32,33. Our ChIP-PCR analyses showed that the enrichment of H3K27me3 in the promoter region of DLG2 was indeed significantly reduced in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells compared to parental DLD1 cells (Fig.\u00a0S5g).",

Compared to the parental cells, the binding of H3K27me3 to D4Z4 repeat sequences on chromosome 4, satellite sequences on chromosome 1, Alu sequences on chromosome 19, and the telomeric TTAGGC repeats at the chromosome 7q was drastically reduced in p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells (Fig.\u00a0S5h), whereas the binding of H3K27me3 to satellite sequences on chromosome 4 and Alu sequences on chromosome 10 was decreased modestly (Fig.\u00a0S5h). In contrast, the binding of H3K27me3 to the promoter region of testis-specific histone 2B was not changed between parental DLD1 and p85\u03b2KR-AA mutant cells.

                        "We next set out to determine how nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 proteins. It has been reported that USP7 deubiquitinates and stabilizes EZH2 in prostate cancer cells34,35. We thus postulated that nuclear p85\u03b2 brings USP7 to EZH1 and EZH2, thereby protecting them from ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Indeed, immunoprecipitation analyses showed that p85\u03b2 interacted with USP7, EZH1, and EZH2 in cell lines harboring a PIK3CA E545K mutation, including DLD1, MB361, and H460 (Fig.\u00a06a, b, Fig.\u00a0S6a, b). In contrast, p85\u03b2 did not interact with USP7, EZH1, or EZH2 in PIK3CA WT (SW480) and H104R mutant (HCT116, T47D, and RKO) cell lines (Fig.\u00a06b and Fig.\u00a0S6b). Knockout or knockdown of p85\u03b2 reduced the binding of USP7 to EZH1 or EZH2 in PIK3CA E545K mutant cell lines DLD1 (Fig.\u00a06c) and MB361 (Fig.\u00a06d). Moreover, the knockdown of p85\u03b1 had no impact on the interactions between EZH1/2 and USP7 (Fig.\u00a06e). Together, the data suggest that p85\u03b2 brings USP7 to the EZH1/2 complexes. Furthermore, compared to the parental cells, levels of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins and H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a06f) were reduced in DLD1 USP7 KO cells that we generated previously36. Consistently, proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment restored EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels in USP7 KO cells (Fig.\u00a06g), whereas EZH1 and EZH2 ubiquitination levels were increased in USP7 KO cells compared to the parental cells (Fig.\u00a06h). Moreover, the stabilization of EZH1 and EZH2 by the nuclear p85\u03b2 seems not to involve the p110\u03b1 or p110\u03b2 catalytic subunits, because EZH1 and EZH2 bound to p85\u03b2, but not p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 (Figure\u00a0S6a). Taken together, the data suggest that nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits USP7 to stabilize EZH1/2, thereby enhancing H3K27 trimethylation.Fig. 6Nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits the deubiquitinase USP7 to stabilize EZH1/2, increasing H3K27 tri-methylation.a Nuclear p85\u03b2 interacts with USP7, EZH1, and EZH2.

Given that the mutation also activates p110\u03b1 kinase activity, we hypothesized that a combination of an EZH inhibitor and a p110\u03b1 inhibitor would have a better tumor inhibitory effect than either alone. We first tested a combination of p110\u03b1 inhibitor Alpelisib (BYL-719) with an EZH inhibitor, GSK2816126. As shown in Fig.\u00a07a, the drug combination induced tumor regression of xenografts established from DLD1 cells, which harbor a PIK3CA E545K mutation, whereas single drugs alone only slowed tumor growth (Fig.\u00a07a). Similar results were obtained with a combination of Alpelisib with another EZH2 inhibitor Tazemetostat (Fig.\u00a07b). We chose Tazemetostat for in-depth studies, because it was recently approved by the FDA to treat EZH2 mutant follicular lymphoma and advanced epithelioid sarcoma37. Our hypothesis predicts that tumors that harbor a PIK3CA helical domain mutation are more sensitive to the drug combination than tumors with WT PIK3CA. To test this notion, we treated tumors established from either PIK3CA E545K-only or PIK3CA WT-only cells. The combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced regression of tumors established with PIK3CA E545K-only (Fig.\u00a07c), whereas the drug combination only slowed down the growth of the PIK3CA WT-only tumors (Fig.\u00a07d). Moreover, the drug combination did not induce tumor regression of a CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) harboring a PIK3CA H1047R kinase domain mutation (Fig.\u00a07e). As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, the PIK3CA helical domain mutations occurred in three residues (E545, E542, and Q546). Since we had demonstrated that the combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced tumor regression of PIK3CA E545K mutant tumors, we next tested if the drug combination induced regression of tumors harboring the other two recurrent PIK3CA helical domain mutations (E542K and Q546P). As shown in Fig.\u00a07f, g, the combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced tumor regression of Vaco481 CRC cells with a PIK3CA Q546P mutation and a CRC PDX harboring a PIK3CA E542K mutation. As expected, compared to PIK3CA E542K mutant PDXs treated with vehicle control, Alpelisib reduced pAKT levels only, Tazemetostat reduced H3K27me3 only, whereas the drug combination decreased levels of both pAKT and H3K27me3 (Fig.\u00a07h). It is worth noting the drug combination was well-tolerated as the body weights of mice were maintained during the course of the drug treatments (Figure\u00a0S7a\u2013g). Moreover, the drug combination inhibited tumor growth synergistically in CRCs with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation (Figure\u00a0S7h), but had only an additive effect on CRCs with either WT PIK3CA or a PIK3CA H1047R mutation (Figure\u00a0S7h). These results suggest that the combination of Tazemetostat and Alpelisib could be an effective treatment for cancers harboring PIK3CA helical domain mutations.Fig. 7A combination of p110\u03b1 and EZH inhibitors induces regression of tumors with PIK3CA helical domain mutations, but not WT or kinase domain mutation.a Subcutaneous xenograft tumors established from DLD1 cells were treated with vehicle or the indicated drugs.

Additionally, our previous study demonstrated that the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins directly bind to IRS1 and activate the canonical PDK1-AKT signaling pathways12. Therefore, PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis through two independent pathways: a canonical p110-PDK1-AKT pathway and a nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 axis (Fig.\u00a08). Moreover, our data suggest that targeting both pathways with Alpelisib and Tazemetostat could be an effective therapeutic approach for PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers.Fig. 8A model for how PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis.PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis through two independent pathways: (1) p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant protein directly interacts with IRS1 to activate the canonical PDK1-AKT pathway12; and (2) p85\u03b2 translocates into the nucleus, stabilizes EZH1/2 by recruiting deubiquitinase USP7, and enhances H3K27 trimethylation. Simultaneously targeting both pathways with Alpelisib, a p110\u03b1 inhibitor, and Tazemetostat, an EZH2 inhibitor, induces regression of tumors harboring a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.",
                "Firstly, this study sheds new light on the nuclear translocation and function of p85\u03b2. We identified an NLS (ELQMKRTAIEAF) in p85\u03b2 that plays a major role in its nuclear translocation. When we mutated the critical basic amino acids KR to AA in both ectopically expressed and endogenous p85\u03b2, the mutant p85\u03b2 protein failed to translocate into the nucleus (Fig.\u00a04 and S4). However, the p85\u03b2 NLS is not sufficient to induce nuclear translocation, as our data showed that p85\u03b2 translocates into the nucleus in the PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines, but not in the WT and PIK3CA kinase domain mutant cell lines (Fig.\u00a03). We postulate that the interaction between IRS1 and p110 helical domain mutant protein results in the release of p85\u03b2 from the PI3K complexes, which in turn exposes the NLS in the iSH2 domain of p85\u03b2 and triggers its nuclear translocation. Although BRD7 has been reported to act as a chaperone for nuclear transport of p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b230,31, our data suggest that BRD7 is not the major mediator of p85\u03b2 nuclear translocation in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancer cells, because knockout of BRD7 only had a marginal effect on nuclear p85\u03b2 levels. It is interesting that p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, dissociates from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins. Our domain-swapping experiment shows that the N-terminal p85\u03b2 sequences cause its dissociation from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins (Fig.\u00a01i, j). Although p85\u03b1 also has a putative NLS sequence, it still tightly binds to p110\u03b1 helical mutant protein, which prevents it from NLS-mediated nuclear translocation.",
                "Secondly, our data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2 plays an oncogenic role in tumors. Nuclear p85\u03b2 has been shown to interact with XBP1 to modulate endoplasmic reticulum stress or binds to BRD7 and XBP1 to regulate glucose homeostasis27\u201331,38. Although it has been proposed that overexpression of p85\u03b2 in some tumor types promotes cancer progression through the canonical PI3K enzymatic activity22, none of the previous studies have implicated nuclear p85\u03b2 in tumorigenesis. Here, we provide several lines of evidence implicating an oncogenic role of nuclear p85\u03b2 in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers: (1) knockout of p85\u03b2 reduces xenograft tumor growth of PIK3CA E545K mutant cells (DLD1 E545K-only and H460), but not the PIK3CA WT cells (DLD1 WT-only) and PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells (RKO); (2) knockdown of p85\u03b2 reduces the growth of a panel of PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines, not a panel of PIK3CA kinase domain mutant cell lines; (3) the p85\u03b2 NLS mutant DLD1 knockin cells, lacking nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2, have reduced xenograft tumor growth.",
                "Thirdly, our data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 by recruiting deubiquitinase USP7, and enhances H3K27 trimethylation, thereby promoting the growth of PIK3CA helical domain mutant tumors. Consistently, an oncogenic role of EZH1/2, especially EZH2, has been well-documented because recurrent gain-of-function EZH2 mutations have been identified in 22% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and ~10% of follicular lymphomas39. Interestingly, the aforementioned oncogenic nuclear p85\u03b2 function seems to be independent of p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2, because our data demonstrated that EZH1 and EZH2 bind to p85\u03b2, but not p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a0S6a). Although our data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 pathway is activated in cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation, we cannot rule out the possibility that this pathway could also be triggered by certain physiological stimuli in normal cells as well.",
                "Lastly, our data suggest that simultaneously targeting nuclear p85\u03b2-stabilized EZHs and p110\u03b1 could be an effective cancer treatment. The p110\u03b1 specific inhibitor Alpelisib in combination with Fulvestrant has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancers with PIK3CA mutation40. However, the efficacy of Alpelisib in other tumor types (such as colorectal cancer) has been disappointing41. Moreover, in some early clinical trials, patients with PIK3CA helical domain mutations are more resistant to Alpelisib than those with PIK3CA kinase domain mutations16,42. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation to this observation, because PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote tumorigenesis through both the canonical PI3K-AKT and the newly discovered nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 pathways. The data suggest that targeting both pathways could be an effective approach to treat PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers. In fact, we have demonstrated that the combination of Alplelisb and EZH2 inhibitor Tazmetostat induced regression of tumors harboring each of the three recurrent PIK3CA helical domain mutations, but not tumors with PIK3CA WT or a kinase domain mutation. It is worth noting that Cha and colleague reported that AKT phosphorylates EZH2 and regulates its methyltransferase activity43. Thus the drug combination may impact EZH2 through two different pathways. Currently, we have only tested the drug combination in CRC models. However, the molecular mechanisms we uncovered here apply to other types of tumor types with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation as well. Ultimately, the efficacy of the drug combination needs to be tested in cancer patients. We are actively pursuing a phase I clinical trial of the combination Alpelisib and Tazemetostat in patients whose tumors harbor a PIK3CA helical domain mutation."

Kaplan-Meier analysis of 5-year survival was performed with a Cox proportional hazards model."

We applied the two-sided t-test to compare the means between the two groups, assuming unequal variances. For xenograft growth, we carried out ANOVA for repeated measurements to test whether there is an overall difference in the tumor sizes by testing group differences as well as whether there was a difference in the development of tumor sizes over time between the two groups by testing the interaction between time and group. The combinatorial effect of drug treatment in vivo was evaluated by combination ratio using the fractional product method. FTV (fractional tumor volume) = mean of final tumor volume of treated group/mean of final tumor volume of the control group. Expected FTV\u2009=\u2009(FTV of agent1) * (FTV of agent2). Observed FTV\u2009=\u2009mean final tumor volume of combinatorial treatment/means final tumor volume of the control group. Combination ratio = expected FTV/observed FTV. Combination ration > 1, = 1, or < 1, was defined as synergy, additive effect, or antagonism, respectively."
