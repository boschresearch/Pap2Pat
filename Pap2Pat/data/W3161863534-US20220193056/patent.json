                        "PIK3CA, which encodes the p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit of PI3 kinase, is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. Recently, the FDA approved the combination of p110\u03b1-specific inhibitor Alpelisib and the estrogen receptor antagonist Fulvestrant to treat PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer patients whose tumors are hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HER2-negative. This approval highlights mutant PIK3CA (encoding p110\u03b1 protein) as a critical cancer drug target and the importance of further understanding the molecular mechanisms by which PIK3CA mutations drive tumorigenesis. PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85 regulatory subunit. Normally, the p85 subunits bind and stabilize the p110 subunit and inhibit its enzymatic activity. Upon growth factor stimulation, the SH2 domains of p85 bind to the phospho-tyrosine residues on receptor protein kinases or adaptor proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which activates PI3K and catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins, including PDK1 and AKTs, to the cell membrane to activate signaling pathways."

                        "Embodiments described herein relate to compositions and methods of treating PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancer in a subject in need thereof. PI3Ks consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 regulatory subunits. PIK3CA, encoding p110\u03b1, is frequently mutated in human cancers. Most PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots: the helical domain and the kinase domains. It was found that in cancer cells with a p110\u03b1 helical domain mutation, p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, disassociates from p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant protein and translocates into the nucleus through a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), thereby promoting tumor growth. The nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits deubiquitinase USP7 to stabilize histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 and enhances histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3). We had previously found that p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins directly bind to IRS1 and activate the canonical PDK1-AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis through two independent pathways: a canonical p110-PDK1-AKT pathway and a nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 axis.",
                        "It was found that simultaneously targeting p85\u03b2-stabilized EZHs and p110\u03b1 reduces the growth of tumors harboring PIK3CA helical domain mutations, but not tumors with PIK3CA WT or kinase domain mutations. Inhibiting or blocking nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 and/or administering an EZH inhibitor sensitizes PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers to p110\u03b1 inhibitors, suggesting that targeting p85\u03b2 nuclear translocation in combination with a p110\u03b1 inhibitor can be an effective therapeutic approach for PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers or tumors. Accordingly, in some embodiments described herein, a method of treating PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancer in a subject in need thereof includes administering to the subject therapeutically effective amounts of (i) an inhibitor of nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 and/or an EZH inhibitor in combination with (ii) a PI3K inhibitor.",

                        "As used herein, the term \u201cseverity\u201d is meant to describe the potential of cancer to transform from a precancerous, or benign, state into a malignant state. Alternatively, or in addition, severity is meant to describe a cancer stage, for example, according to the TNM system (accepted by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)) or by other art-recognized methods. Cancer stage refers to the extent or severity of the cancer, based on factors such as the location of the primary tumor, tumor size, number of tumors, and lymph node involvement (spread of cancer into lymph nodes). Alternatively, or in addition, severity is meant to describe the tumor grade by art-recognized methods (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov). Tumor grade is a system used to classify cancer cells in terms of how abnormal they look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread. Many factors are considered when determining tumor grade, including the structure and growth pattern of the cells. The specific factors used to determine tumor grade vary with each type of cancer. Severity also describes a histologic grade, also called differentiation, which refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells of the same tissue type (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov). Furthermore, severity describes a nuclear grade, which refers to the size and shape of the nucleus in tumor cells and the percentage of tumor cells that are dividing (see, National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov).",
                        "In another aspect of the disclosure, severity describes the degree to which a tumor has secreted growth factors, degraded the extracellular matrix, become vascularized, lost adhesion to juxtaposed tissues, or metastasized. Moreover, severity describes the number of locations to which a primary tumor has metastasized. Finally, severity includes the difficulty of treating tumors of varying types and locations. For example, inoperable tumors, those cancers which have greater access to multiple body systems (hematological and immunological tumors), and those which are the most resistant to traditional treatments are considered most severe. In these situations, prolonging the life expectancy of the subject and/or reducing pain, decreasing the proportion of cancerous cells or restricting cells to one system, and improving cancer stage/tumor grade/histological grade/nuclear grade are considered alleviating a sign or symptom of the cancer.",

PI3Ks consist of p110 catalytic subunits and p85 regulatory subunits. PIK3CA, encoding p110\u03b1, is frequently mutated in human cancers. Most PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots: the helical domain and the kinase domains. It was found that in cancer cells with a p110\u03b1 helical domain mutation, p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, disassociates from p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant protein and translocates into the nucleus through a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), thereby promoting tumor growth. The nuclear p85\u03b2 recruits deubiquitinase USP7 to stabilize histone methyltransferases EZH1 and EZH2 and enhances histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27Me3). We had previously found that p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins directly bind to IRS1 and activate the canonical PDK1-AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis through two independent pathways: a canonical p110-PDK1-AKT pathway and a nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 axis.",

                                "We previously demonstrated that p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins (e.g., E545K) gain direct interaction with IRS1 independent of p85\u03b1 and \u03b2, thereby rewiring oncogenic signaling. To gain insights into how the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutations impact PI3K complex formation, we immunoprecipitated either wild-type (WT) p110\u03b1 or p110 \u03b1 E545K mutant protein in cell lines with the WT or mutant endogenous p110\u03b1 proteins tagged with 3\u00d7FLAG [FIG. 1A]. Interestingly, compared to the WT p110\u03b1 protein, the p110 \u03b1 E545K protein drastically reduced its binding to p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1 (FIGS. 1B and 8A). This observation was further validated by reciprocal immunoprecipitation of either p853 or p85\u03b1 in isogenic DLD1 cell lines with either WT-only (PIK3CA E545K allele knockout) or E545K-only (PIK3CA WT allele knockout, FIGS. 1C, 1D, 8B, and 8C). We postulated that some of the p85\u03b2 proteins might disassociate from the PI3K complexes in PIK3CA E545K mutant cells. Indeed, immunoprecipitation with both p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 in the isogenic DLD1 E545K-only and WT-only cells showed more PI3K complex-free (post-IP) p85\u03b2 were present in the E545K-only cells than in the WT-only cells (FIG. 8C). These results were further validated by gel-filtration analyses (FIG. 8E).",
                                "Tumor-derived PIK3CA mutations are clustered in two hotspots: one in the helical domain at E542, E545, Q546, and the other in the kinase domain at the H1047 site. We set out to determine which mutations in p110\u03b1 affect binding to p85\u03b2. As shown in FIGS. 1E, 1F and 8F, as with the p110\u03b1 E545K mutant, the p110\u03b1 E542K and Q546K mutant proteins disrupted their interactions with p85\u03b2 compared to the WT p110\u03b1. In contrast, the kinase domain p110\u03b1 H1047R mutant protein had no impact on p85\u03b2 binding. Neither did other relative rare p110\u03b1 mutant proteins including R88Q and K111N in the ABD domain, N345K and C420R in the C2 domain, M1043I and G1049R in the kinase domain (FIGS. 1E, 1F, and 8F).",

Consistently, the interaction between p85\u03b2 and p110\u03b1 were weaker in two cell lines with PIK3CA E545K mutation (DLD1 and H460) than in either two cell lines with wild-type PIK3CA (SW480 and LoVo) or two cell lines with PIK3CA H1047R mutation (HCT116 and T47D) (FIGS. 1G, 1H, 8G, and 8H). In contrast, the interactions between p85\u03b2 and p110\u03b2 or between p85\u03b1 and p110\u03b1 were similar in these six cell lines (FIGS. 1G, 1H, 8G, and 8H). Together, our data suggest that the p85\u03b2 protein dissociates from the mutant p110\u03b1 in cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.",

A protein sequence alignment showed that the SH3 domain, GAP domain, and link region between the GAP and nSH2 domains in the N-terminus sequences between p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 are less conserved (56% identical, FIG. 1I). In contrast, the three SH2 domains in the two proteins' C-terminus are highly conserved (91% identical, FIG. 1I). We postulated that the N-terminus sequences of p85\u03b2 might cause its disassociation from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins. To this end, we constructed two chimeric p85 proteins that swapped the N-terminus regions of p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2 (FIG. 1I). As shown in FIG. 1J, the N-terminal p85\u03b1-C-terminal p85\u03b2 chimeric proteins bound similarly to both p110\u03b1 WT and E545K mutant proteins, whereas the N-terminal p85\u03b2-C-terminal p85\u03b1 chimeric protein bound to less p110\u03b1 E545K mutant protein compared to the WT counterpart (FIG. 1J). These data suggest that the N-terminal sequences of p85\u03b2 cause its disassociation from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins.",

                                "To explore the specific function of p85\u03b2 in p110\u03b1 helical domain mutated tumors, we assessed whether p85\u03b2 expression levels are associated with any clinical outcomes. We chose to analyze the following four TCGA datasets because PIK3CA is frequently mutated, and PIK3R2 is overexpressed in these tumor types: colorectal cancer (COAD), bladder carcinoma (BLCA), endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), and breast cancer (BRCA) (FIG. 9A). Because the number of patients whose tumors harbor PIK3CA mutations is small in each tumor type, we combined the TCGA data of the four tumor types together and divided the patients into three groups according to the PIK3CA mutation status: helical domain mutation group, non-helical domain mutation group, and wild-type group. Interestingly, high expression of PIK3R2 was found to be significantly associated with poor five-year survival only in the helical domain mutation group (HR=2.146, 95% CI 1.162\u02dc3.96, p=0.0148), but not in the non-helical domain mutation group (HR=0.9126, 95% CI 0.5714\u02dc1.4, p=0.7017) or wild-type group (HR=0.9325, 95% CI 0.7404\u02dc1.1, p=0.5527) (FIG. 2A). These data suggest that p85\u03b2 may promote tumorigenesis in tumors with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.",

                                "To further investigate the function of p85\u03b2 in the context of PIK3CA helical domain mutation, we knocked out p85\u03b2 in the isogenic DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only and PIK3CA WT-only cell lines (FIG. 2B). As shown in FIGS. 2C to 2F, knockout of p85\u03b2 reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth of the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells, but not the WT PIK3CA-only counterpart. Similarly, knockdown of p85\u03b2 reduced cell proliferation and colony formation of PIK3CA E545K mutant MDA-MB361 breast cancer cells and H460 lung cancer cells and PIK3CA E542K mutant SW948 cells (FIGS. 2G-I, 9B-D). In contrast, knockdown of p85\u03b2 had no impact on cell proliferation and colony formation of PIK3CA H1047R mutant T47D breast cancer cells and RKO colon cancer cells, or PIK3CA WT SW480 cells (FIGS. 2G-O, 9E-H). Together, these data suggest that p85\u03b2 promotes the growth of tumors harboring PIK3CA helical domain mutations, but not those tumors with WT or PIK3CA kinase domain mutations.",

                                "Next, we set out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which p85\u03b2 promotes the growth of cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation. Given that it is well documented that PI3K transduces signaling to AKT, we examined whether p85\u03b2 knockout impacts AKT and its downstream signaling. As shown in FIG. 10A, knockout of p85\u03b2 did not affect phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3\u03b2, Foxo, mTOR, and p70S6K in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells regardless of whether under serum starvation conditions or when stimulated by insulin or EGF. Moreover, neither knockout of p85\u03b2 impacted p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 protein levels in PIK3CA mutant-only cells (FIG. 10A), nor did overexpression of p85\u03b2 affect the levels of p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, and AKT phosphorylation in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells (FIG. 10B). In contrast, overexpression of p85\u03b1 increases the levels of p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2 and AKT phosphorylation (FIG. 8B). Those data suggest that p85\u03b1, but not p85\u03b2, is the major regulatory subunit for PI3K activity in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells.",
                                "It has been reported that p85 proteins can translocate to the nucleus. We thus performed immunofluorescent staining of p85\u03b2 in the isogenic DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only and PIK3CA WT-only cell lines. As shown in FIG. 3A, p85\u03b2 was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells, but only in the cytoplasm in the DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells. The specificity of the anti-p85\u03b2 antibody was demonstrated by the lack of staining in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 knockout cells (FIG. 3A). Consistently, cell fractionation analyses showed that significantly more p85\u03b2 was located in the nucleus in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells (FIGS. 3B & 3C). In agreement with previous reports, a small fraction of p85\u03b1 was also present in the nucleus (FIG. 3B), although the amounts of nuclear p85\u03b1 were similar between the isogenic DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells and DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells (FIG. 3C). Because BRD7 was reported to facilitate nuclear translocation of p85\u03b1, we compared BRD7 protein levels between the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only and PIK3CA WT-only cells. FIG. 3B shows that BRD7 proteins were largely localized to the nucleus to a similar degree in the two cell lines, suggesting that the differential nuclear localization of p85\u03b2 in the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K cells is unlikely to be mediated by BRD7. Consistently, knockout of BRD7 in DLD1 cells largely abolished nuclear translocation of p85\u03b1 but not p85\u03b2 (FIGS. 10C and D).",
                                "To assess the generality and specificity of p85\u03b2 nuclear localization in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cells, we analyzed cellular localization of p85\u03b2 in a panel of cell lines: two additional PIK3CA E545K mutant cell lines (H460 and MB361); three PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells lines (HCT116, RKO, and T47D); and two WT PIK3CA cell lines (SW480 and LoVo). Both immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation demonstrated that p85\u03b2 was translocated into the nucleus in the cell lines with a PIK3CA E545K mutation, but not in cell lines with WT PIK3CA or H1047R mutation (FIGS. 3D to 3J). Furthermore, overexpressing PIK3CA E545K protein into SW480 cells facilitates the nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2 (FIG. 10E). Consistently, compared to PIK3CA wild-type tumors, immunohistochemistry staining of human colon cancer specimens showed that p85\u03b2 was predominantly localized in the nuclei of tumors with a PIK3CA E545K mutation (FIG. 10F), but mostly localized in the cytoplasm of tumors with wild-type PIK3CA (FIG. 10G). Together, those data suggest that p85\u03b2 dissociates from the PI3K complexes and translocates into the nucleus in cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.",

                                "To determine how p85\u03b2 translocates into the nucleus, we exploited a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) prediction tool (cNLS Mapper) and identified a putative NLS at amino acids 474 to 484 of p85\u03b2 (FIG. 4A). To test if this NLS mediates nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2, we reconstituted the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells with HA-tagged WT p85\u03b2, or mutant p85\u03b2 construct, in which the two basic amino acids K477 and R478 in the NLS were mutated to alanine (FIG. 11A). Although both the WT and K477A/R478A mutant p85\u03b2 bound similarly to WT p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2, immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation showed that the WT p85\u03b2 translocated into the nucleus, but the K477A/R478A mutant p85\u03b2 remained in the cytoplasm (FIGS. 11B & C). Interestingly, reconstitution of the WT, but not the mutant p85\u03b2, rescued the defects in cell growth and colony formation of the DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells (FIGS. 11D & E). As expected, both WT and the mutant p85\u03b2 reduced their interactions with p110\u03b1 E545K mutant protein, but retained the interactions with p110\u03b1 H1047R mutant protein and p110\u03b2 (FIGS. 11A &F). To further validate this observation, we generated p85\u03b2. K477A/R478A mutant knockin (KI) DLD1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing (FIG. 4B). Two independently-derived homozygous KI clones termed p85\u03b2KR-AA were chosen for in-depth analyses. The p85\u03b2KR-AA mutation did not impact levels of itself, p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, and AKT phosphorylation (FIG. 4C), suggesting that the p85\u03b2 NLS mutant does not affect the kinase activity of PI3K. Nonetheless, the NLS mutant p85\u03b2KR-AA failed to translocate into the nucleus (FIG. 4D). Moreover, p850KR-AA mutant KI cell lines displayed reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and xenograft tumor growth (FIGS. 4E to G). Together, those data suggest that nuclear but not cytoplasmic p85\u03b2 promotes the growth of cancer cells with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation.",

                                "We postulated that the p85\u03b2 present in the nucleus might regulate gene expression. Thus, we performed expression profiling of DLD1 parental cells and the two independently-derived p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant clones. Compared with the parental cells, expression levels of 137 genes were up-regulated, and 116 genes were down-regulated in both p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant clones (FIG. 12A), suggesting that the nuclear p85\u03b2 might regulate global gene transcription. We thus examined histone modifications in parental cells and p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant clones. As shown in FIG. 5A, levels of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) were reduced in the two p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant clones compared to the parental DLD1 cells (FIG. 5A). Consistently, levels of H3K27me3 were higher in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the isogenic PIK3CA WT-only cells (FIG. 5B). Moreover, knockout of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells or knockdown of p85\u03b2 in MB-361 cells, which harbors a PIK3CA E545K mutation, decreased the levels of H3K27me3 (FIG. 5B). Conversely, the reconstitution of WT p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant, in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells restored the levels of H3K27me3 (FIG. 5C). In contrast, the depletion of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA WT-only cells or T47D (PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells) had no impact on H3K27me3 (FIG. 5B). Furthermore, knockout of p85\u03b2 did not affect histone trimethylation at other sites, including H3K4, H3K9, H3K36, and H3K76 (FIG. 12B). Taken together, the data suggest that nuclear p85\u03b2 modulates H3K27me3, a marker for transcriptional repression.",
                                "Given that EZH1 and EZH2 are the histone methyltransferases for the H3K27 site, we next examined if nuclear p85\u03b2 regulates EZH1 and EZH2. As shown in FIG. 5A, compared to parental cells, levels of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins were markedly reduced in p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant knockin clones. Consistently, levels of EZH1 and EZH2 proteins were higher in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the isogenic PIK3CA WT-only cells (FIG. 5B), whereas the depletion of p85\u03b2 decreased EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels in PIK3CA E545K mutant cells (DLD1 E545K and MB-361), but not in cells with WT PIK3CA or a PIK3CA H1047R mutation (DLD1 PIK3CA WT and T47D) (FIG. 5B). Conversely, the reconstitution of WT p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b2 KR-AA mutant, in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only p85\u03b2 KO cells restored EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels (FIG. 5C). Moreover, the knockout of p85\u03b2 reduced EZH 1 and EZH2 protein stability (FIG. 12C). Consistently, the knockout of p85\u03b2 in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells did not affect mRNA levels of EZH1 and EZH2 (FIG. 12D). It is worth noting that the knockout of p85\u03b2 did not impact other components of the PCR2 complex (FIG. 12B). Together, these data suggest that nuclear p85\u03b2 regulates EZH1 and EZH2 protein stability, thereby enhancing H3K27me3.",

                                "We next set out to determine how nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 proteins. It has been reported that USP7 deubiquitinates and stabilizes EZH2 in prostate cancer cells. We thus postulated that nuclear p85\u03b2 brings USP7 to EZH1 and EZH2, thereby protecting them from ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. This notion is supported by the following pieces of evidence: 1) immunoprecipitation analyses showed that p85\u03b2 interacted with USP7, EZH1, and EZH2 in DLD1 cells, which harbor a PIK3CA E545K mutation (FIG. 5D); 2) more USP7 bound to EZH1 or EZH2 in DLD1 PIK3CA E545K-only cells than in the isogenic p85\u03b2 KO cells (FIG. 5E); 3) EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels were reduced in DLD1 USP7 KO cells that we generated previously, compared to the parental cells (FIG. 5F); 4) proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment restored EZH1 and EZH2 protein levels in USP7 KO cells (FIG. 5G); and 5) EZH1 and EZH2 ubiquitination levels were increased in USP7 KO cells compared to the parental cells (FIG. 5H). Moreover, the stabilization of EZH1 and EZH2 by the nuclear p85\u03b2 seems not to involve the p110\u03b1 or p110\u03b2 catalytic subunits, because EZH1 and EZH2 bound to p85\u03b2, but not p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 (FIG. 12E).

                                "We have shown that the nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 in cancer cells with a PIK3CA E545K mutation. Given that the mutation also activates p110\u03b1 kinase activity, we hypothesized that a combination of an EZH inhibitor and a p110\u03b1 inhibitor would have a better tumor inhibitory effect than either alone. We first tested a combination of p110\u03b1 inhibitor Alpelisib (BYL-719) with an EZH inhibitor, GSK2816126. As shown in FIG. 6A, the drug combination induced tumor regression of xenografts established from DLD1 cells, which harbor a PIK3CA E545K mutation, whereas single drugs alone only slowed tumor growth (FIG. 6A). Similar results were obtained with a combination of Alpelisib with another EZH2 inhibitor Tazemetostat (FIG. 6B). We chose Tazemetostat for in-depth studies, because it was recently approved by the FDA to treat EZH2 mutant follicular lymphoma and advanced epithelioid sarcoma. Our hypothesis predicts that tumors that harbor a PIK3CA helical domain mutation are more sensitive to the drug combination than tumors with WT PIK3CA. To test this notion, we treated tumors established from either PIK3CA E545K-only or PIK3CA WT-only cells. The combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced regression of tumors established with PIK3CA E545K-only (FIG. 6C), whereas the drug combination only slowed down the growth of the PIK3CA WT-only tumors (FIG. 6D). Moreover, the drug combination did not induce tumor regression of a CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) harboring a PIK3CA H1047R kinase domain mutation (FIG. 6E). As shown in FIG. 2, the PIK3CA helical domain mutations occurred in three residues (E545, E542, and Q546). Since we had demonstrated that the combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced tumor regression of PIK3CA E545K mutant tumors, we next tested if the drug combination induced regression of tumors harboring the other two recurrent PIK3CA helical domain mutations (E542K and Q546P). As shown in FIGS. 6F and G, the combination of Alpelisib and Tazemetostat induced tumor regression of Vaco481 CRC cells with a PIK3CA Q546P mutation and a CRC PDX harboring a PIK3CA E542K mutation. As expected, compared to PIK3CA E542K mutant PDXs treated with vehicle control, Alpelisib reduced pAKT levels only, Tazemetostat reduced H3K27me3 only, whereas the drug combination decrease levels of both pAKT and H3K27me3 (FIG. 6H). It is worth noting the drug combination was well-tolerated as the body weights of mice were maintained during the course of the drug treatments (FIGS. 13A to H). These results suggest that the combination of Tezametostat and Alpelisib could be an effective treatment for cancers harboring PIK3CA helical domain mutations.",
                                "This Example describes a previously unrecognized mechanism by which PIK3CA helical domain mutations exert oncogenic signaling: p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, dissociates from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant protein and translocates into the nucleus. The nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1/2 by recruiting deubiquitinase USP7 to the two proteins and enhancing H3K27 trimethylation. Additionally, our previous study demonstrated that the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins directly bind to IRS1 and activate the canonical PDK1-AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, PIK3CA helical domain mutations promote oncogenesis through two independent pathways: a canonical p110-PDK1-AKT pathway and a nuclear p85\u03b2-USP7-EZH1/2 axis (FIG. 7). Moreover, our data suggest that targeting both pathways with Alpelisib and Tazemetostat could be an effective therapeutic approach for PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers.",
                                "Firstly, this Example sheds new light on the nuclear translocation and function of p85\u03b2. We identified an NLS in p85\u03b2 that plays a major role in its nuclear translocation. When we mutated the critical basic amino acids KR to AA in both ectopically expressed and endogenous p85\u03b2, the mutant p85\u03b2 protein fail to translocate into the nucleus (FIGS. 4 and 11). However, the p85\u03b2 NLS is not sufficient to induce nuclear translocation, as our data showed that p85\u03b2 translocates into the nucleus in the PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines, but not in the WT and PIK3CA kinase domain mutant cell lines (FIG. 3). We postulate that the release of p85\u03b2 from the PI3K complexes and exposure of the NLS in the iSH2 domain trigger p85\u03b2 nuclear translocation. Although BRD7 has been reported to act as a chaperone for nuclear transport of p85\u03b1 and p85\u03b2, our data suggest that BRD7 is not the major mediator of p85\u03b2 nuclear translocation in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancer cells, because knockout of BRD7 only had a marginal effect on nuclear p85\u03b2 levels. It is interesting that p85\u03b2, but not p85\u03b1, dissociates from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins. Our domain-swapping experiment shows that the N-terminal p85\u03b2 sequences cause its dissociation from the p110\u03b1 helical domain mutant proteins (FIGS. 1I & J). Although p85\u03b1 also has a putative NLS sequence, it still tightly binds to p110\u03b1 helical mutant protein, which prevents it from the NLS-mediated nuclear translocation.",
                                "Secondly, our data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2 plays an oncogenic role in tumors. Nuclear p85\u03b2 has been shown to interact with XBP1 to modulate endoplasmic reticulum stress or binds to BRD7 and XBP1 to regulate glucose homeostasis. Although it has been proposed that overexpression of p85\u03b2 in some tumor types promotes cancer progression through the canonical PI3K enzymatic activity, none of the previous studies have implicated nuclear p85\u03b2 in tumorigenesis. Here, we provide several lines of evidence implicating an oncogenic role of nuclear p85\u03b2 in PIK3CA helical domain mutant cancers: (1) knockout of p85\u03b2 reduces xenograft tumor growth of DLD1 PIK3CA E545K cells, but not the isogenic PIK3CA WT cells; (2) knockdown of p85\u03b2 reduces the growth of a panel of PIK3CA helical domain mutant cell lines, not a panel of PIK3CA kinase domain mutant cell lines; (3) the p85\u03b2 NLS mutant DLD1 knockin cells, lacking nuclear translocation of p85\u03b2, have reduced xenograft tumor growth.",
                                "Thirdly, our data suggest that the nuclear p85\u03b2 stabilizes EZH1 and EZH2 by recruiting deubiquitinase USP7, and enhances H3K27 trimethylation, thereby promoting the growth of PIK3CA helical domain mutant tumors. Consistently, an oncogenic role of EZH1/2, especially EZH2, has been well-documented because recurrent gain-of-function EZH2 mutations have been identified in 22% of diffuse large-cell B cell lymphomas and \u02dc10% of follicular lymphomas. Interestingly, the aforementioned oncogenic nuclear p85\u03b2 function seems to be independent of p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2, because our data demonstrated that EZH1 and EZH2 bind to p85\u03b2, but not p110\u03b1 and p110\u03b2 (FIG. 12E).",
                                "Lastly, our data suggest that simultaneously targeting nuclear p85\u03b2-stabilized EZHs and p110\u03b1 could be an effective cancer treatment. The p110\u03b1 specific inhibitor Alpelisib in combination with Fulvestrant has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancers with PIK3CA mutation. However, the efficacy of Alpelisib in other tumor types (such as colorectal cancer) has been disappointing. Moreover, in some early clinical trials, patients with PIK3CA helical domain mutations are more resistant to Alpelisib than those with PIK3CA kinase domain mutations. Thus, novel approaches are needed to target the PIK3CA helical domain mutations. Our data demonstrated that the combination of Alplelisb and EZH2 inhibitor Tazmetostat induced regression of tumors harboring each of the three recurrent PIK3CA helical domain mutations, but not tumors with PIK3CA WT or a kinase domain mutation. The molecular mechanisms we uncovered here apply not only to CRC but to other types of tumor types with a PIK3CA helical domain mutation as well."
