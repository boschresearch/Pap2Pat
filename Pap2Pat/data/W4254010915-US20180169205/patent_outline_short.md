# DESCRIPTION

## BACKGROUND

### Field of the Invention

- relate to vaccines

### Related Art

- discuss adaptive immune antibody responses

## SUMMARY

- provide method of inducing T cell-independent immune response

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe hybrid protein composition
- discuss administration and formulation of vaccine composition
- outline various adjuvants and carriers for vaccine composition

### Example 1

- describe design and production of hFliC protein
- detail purification and characterization of hFliC protein
- explain molecular modeling of FliC and hFliC filaments
- describe polymerization of hFliC or FliC
- outline various assays and tests (circular dichroism, negative stain transmission electron microscopy, ELISA, immunogold labeling, B cell crosslink
- describe immunization protocol and ELISA for quantification of antibody titers

### Example 2

- design hybrid flagellin protein
- characterize hybrid flagellin protein
- analyze humoral immune response in non-restricted mouse models
- show hybrid flagellin filaments crosslink BCR in vitro
- analyze humoral immune response in TI mouse model
- provide additional characterizations of hybrid flagellin filaments
- describe hFliC filament structure
- demonstrate antigenicity of hFliC filaments
- evaluate in vivo activity of hFliC in TD model
- test hFliC filaments in TCR restricted model
- discuss implications for vaccine development

## CONCLUSIONS

- summarize hybrid protein filaments as vaccine scaffold
