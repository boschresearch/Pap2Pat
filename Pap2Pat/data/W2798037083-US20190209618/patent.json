                        "Although umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are essential in many life-saving regenerative therapies, their limited number in CB units has significantly restricted their clinical use and the subsequent advantages they provide during transplantation (Miller et al. 2013). Select small molecules that enhance hematopoietic stem and/or progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in culture have been identified (Boitano et al. 2010; Fares et al., 2014) however, in many cases their mechanisms of action or the nature of the pathways they impinge on are poorly understood. A greater understanding of the molecular pathways that underpin the unique human HSC self-renewal program will facilitate the development of targeted strategies that expand these critical cell types for regenerative therapies. Whereas transcription factor networks have been shown to influence the self-renewal and lineage decisions of human HSCs (Novershtern et al., 2011; Laurenti et al., 2013), the post-transcriptional mechanisms guiding HSC fate have not been closely investigated."

                        "In one aspect, the inventors have shown that overexpression of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-2 (MSI2) induces multiple pro-self-renewal phenotypes. Overexpression of MSI2 resulted in a 17-fold increase in short-term repopulating cells and a net 23-fold ex vivo expansion of long-term repopulating HSCs. The inventors have also determined that MSI2 directly attenuates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling through post-transcriptional downregulation of canonical AHR pathway components in cord blood (CB) HSPCs by performing a global analysis of MSI2-RNA interactions. This provides new insights into RBP-controlled RNA networks that underlie the self-renewal process. These networks may be manipulated to enhance the regenerative potential of human HSCs. Examination of MSI2 OE-induced differentially expressed genes found Cytochrome P450 1B1 Oxidase (CYP1B1), an effector of AHR signaling (Mimura et al., 2013) amongst the most repressed. As shown in the Examples, a number of inhibitors of CYP1B1, including but not limited to (E)-2,3\u2032,4,5\u2032-Tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), Chrysin, Narigenin and Acacetin as well as siRNA that targets CYP1B1 expression have also been demonstrated to promote the self-renewal and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell cultures.",

For STRC LDA transplantation experiments 1\u00d7105 sorted CD34+CD38+ cells were used per control and MSI2 OE transduction. After assessing levels of gene transfer, day zero equivalent GFP+ cell doses were calculated to perform the LDA. Recipients with greater than 0.1% GFP+CD45+/\u2212 cells were considered to be repopulated. For STRC experiments that readout extended engraftment at 6.5 weeks, 2\u00d7105 CD34+CD38+ cells were used per OE and control transduction allowing for non-limiting 5\u00d7104 day zero equivalent cell doses per mouse. For HSC expansion and LDA experiments CD34+CD38\u2212 cells were sorted and transduced with MSI2 OE or control vectors (50,000 cells per condition) for three days and then analyzed for gene-transfer levels (% GFP+/\u2212) and primitive cell marker expression (% CD34 and CD133). To ensure equal numbers of GFP+ cells were transplanted in both control and MSI2 OE mice, we added identically cultured GFP\u2212 cells to the MSI2 culture to match % GFP+of the control culture (necessary due to the differing efficiency of transduction). The adjusted OE culture was recounted and aliquoted (63,000 cells) to match the output of half the control culture. Three day 0 equivalent GFP+ cell doses (1000, 300 and 62) were then transplanted per mouse to perform the D3 primary LDA. A second aliquot of the adjusted OE culture was then taken and put in to culture in parallel with the remaining half of the control culture for performing another LDA after 7 days of growth (10 days total growth, D10 primary LDA). Altogether, 4 cell doses were transplanted, if converted back to day 0 equivalents these equaled approximately 1000, 250, 100, and 20 GFP+ cells per mouse, respectively. Pooled bone marrow from six engrafted primary mice that received D10 cultured control or MSI2 OE cells (from 2 highest doses transplanted) was aliquoted in to 4 cell doses of 15 million, 10 million, 6 million, 2 million and 1 million cells. Numbers of GFP+ cells within primary mice was estimated from nucleated cell counts obtained from NSG femurs, tibias and pelvis and from Colvin et al., 2004. The cutoff for HSC engraftment was a demonstration of multilineage reconstitution which was set at BM having >0.1% GFP+ CD33+ and >0.1% GFP+CD19+ cells. Assessment of HSC and STRC frequency was carried out by using ELDA software (Hu & Smyth, 2009). For all mouse transplantation experiments, mice were aged (6-12 wk) and sex matched. All transplanted mice were included for analysis unless mice died from radiation sickness before the experimental endpoint. No randomization or blinding was performed for animal experiments. Approximately 3-6 mice were used per cell dose for each CB transduction and transplantation experiment.",

Briefly, 25 million NB4 cells, a transformed human cell line of hematopoietic origin, were washed in PBS and UV-cross-linked at 400mJ/cm2 on ice. Cells were pelleted, lysed in wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40), DNAse treated, and supernatants from lysates were collected for immunoprecipitation. MSI2 was immunoprecipitated overnight using 5 \u03bcg of anti-MSI2 antibody (EP1305Y, Abcam) and Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Beads containing immunoprecipated RNA were washed twice with wash buffer, high-salt wash buffer (5\u00d7PBS, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40), and PNK buffer (50 mM Tris-CI pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40). Samples were then treated with 0.2 U MNase for 5 minutes at 37 degrees with shaking to trim immunopreciptated RNA. MNase inactivation was then carried out with PNK+EGTA buffer (50 mM Tris-CI pH 7.4, 20 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40). The sample was dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase (CIP, NEB) at 37 degrees for 10 followed by washing with PNK+EGTA, PNK buffer, and then 0.1 mg/mL BSA in nuclease free water. 3\u2032 RNA linker ligation was performed at 16 degrees overnight with the following adapter: 5\u2032 P-UGGAAUUCUCGGGUGCCAAGG-puromycin (SEQ ID NO: 11). Samples were then washed with PNK buffer, radiolabelled using P32-y-ATP (Perkin Elmer), run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was developed via autoradiography and RNA-protein complexes 15-20 kDa above the molecular weight of MSI2 was extracted with Proteinase K followed by RNA extraction with acid phenol-chloroform. A 5\u2032 RNA linker (5\u2032 HO-GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACGAUC-OH) (SEQ ID NO: 12) was ligated to the extracted RNA using T4 RNA ligase (Fermentas) for two hours and the RNA was again purified using acid phenol-chloroform. Adapter ligated RNA was re-suspended in nuclease free water and reverse transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 20 cycles of PCR were performed using NEB Phusion Polymerase using a 3\u2032 PCR primer that contained a unique Illumina barcode sequence. PCR products were run on an 8% TBE gel. Products ranging between 150-200 bp were extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and re-suspended in nuclease free water. Two separate libraries were prepared and sent for single-end 50 bp Illumina sequencing at the Institute for Genomic Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. 47,098,127 reads from the first library passed quality filtering of which 73.83% mapped uniquely to the human genome. 57,970,220 reads from the second library passed quality filtering of which 69.53% mapped uniquely to the human genome.

                                "The role of MSI2 in post-transcriptionally controlling human HSPC self-renewal was investigated as it is known to regulate mouse HSCs, (Hope et al., 2010, de Andres-Aguayo et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014) and is predicted to impact mRNA translation (Ohyama et al., 2012). MSI2 was present and elevated in primitive CB HSPCs and decreased during differentiation, whereas its paralog, MSI1, was not expressed (FIG. 5a-f). Lentiviral overexpression (OE) of MSI2 resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in colony forming units (CFU) relative to control, principally due to a 3.7-fold increase in the most primitive CFU-Granulocyte Erythrocyte Monocyte Megakaryocyte (GEMM) colony type (FIG. 6a, FIG. 1a). Remarkably, 100% of MSI2 OE CFU-GEMMs generated secondary colonies compared to only 40% of controls. In addition, MSI2 OE yielded 3-fold more colonies per re-seeded CFU-GEMM (FIG. 1b, c, FIG. 6b). During in vitro culture MSI2 OE resulted in 2.3- and 6-fold more cells relative to control at the 7 and 21-day time points, respectively (FIG. 6c, d). Moreover after 7 days in culture MSI2 OE yielded a cumulative 9.3-fold increase in colony forming cells in the absence of changes in cell cycling or death (FIG. 6e-h). Altogether, this data demonstrates that enforced expression of MSI2 has potent self-renewal effects on early progenitors and promotes their in vitro expansion.",
                                "Short-term repopulating cells (STRC) produce a transient multilineage graft in NOD-scid-IL2R\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mice (Glimm et al., 2001), and in patients reconstitute granulocytes and platelets critical for preventing post-transplant infection and bleeding (Miller et al., 2013). STRCs overexpressing MSI2 exhibited 1.8-fold more primitive CD34+ cells post-infection and a dramatic 17-fold increase in functional STRCs relative to control as readout through limiting dilution analysis (LDA) of human chimerism at 3 weeks post-transplant (FIG. 1d-f, FIG. 7a, b). Furthermore, at a protracted engraftment readout time of 6.5 weeks at non-limiting transplant doses, 100% of MSI2 OE STRC transplanted mice were engrafted compared to only 50% of controls, indicating MSI2 OE extended the duration of STRC-mediated engraftment (FIG. 7c).",
                                "Next, the effect of shRNA-induced MSI2 knockdown (KD) on HSPC function was investigated. MSI2 OE did not alter clonogenic potential but did decrease CFU replating 3-fold (FIG. 8a-c). When effects on more primitive culture-initiating cells were explored we found MSI2 KD significantly decreased cell number over culture (FIG. 8d, e) independent of increased death or altered cell cycling. Upon transplantation, engrafted MSI2 KD GFP+ cells showed no evidence of lineage skewing, yet were strikingly reduced relative to the percentage of GFP+ cells initially transplanted (FIG. 8f-h). Combined, the in vitro and in vivo data show that MSI2 KD reduces self-renewal in early progenitors and HSCs.",
                                "To characterize the earliest transcriptional changes induced by modulating MSI2 expression, RNA-seq was performed on CD34+ MSI2 OE and KD cells immediately post-transduction. MSI2 OE-induced transcriptional changes anti-correlated with those of MSI2 KD, suggesting OE and KD have opposite effects (FIG. 9a). When compared to transcriptome data from 38 human hematopoietic cell subpopulations (Novershtern et al., 2011), it was observed that genes significantly upregulated upon MSI2 OE and downregulated upon MSI2 KD were exclusively enriched for those highly expressed in HSC and other primitive CD34+ populations (FIG. 9b).",
                                "Since MSI2 OE conferred an HSC gene expression program, it was hypothesized that it could facilitate HSC expansion ex vivo. Remarkably, MSI2 OE induced a 4-fold increase in CD34+CD133+ phenotypic HSCs relative to control after 7 days of culture (FIG. 2a). An LDA was performed to define functional HSC frequency before (day 3 post transduction, D3) and after 7 days of ex vivo culture (day 10, D10, FIG. 10a). D3 recipients displayed no altered engraftment as a result of MSI2 OE, however, recipients of MSI2 OE D10 expanded cells displayed multiple phenotypes of enhanced reconstitution relative to control, including a 2-fold increase in BM GFP+ levels without changes to lineage output, proportionally more GFP+ cells within the human graft relative to pre-transplant D10 levels, greater GFP mean fluorescence intensity and enrichment of CD34 expression in GFPhigh cells (FIG. 2b, c, FIG. 10b-h). As the lentiviral construct design ensures GFP levels mirror MSI2's, this indicates high levels of MSI2 impart enhanced competitiveness and are conducive to in vivo HSPC activity. Importantly, D10 MSI2 OE cultures contained more CD34+CD133+ cells prior to transplant (FIG. 10i), and in accordance, the HSC frequency in D10 MSI2 OE cultures was increased 2-fold relative to the D3 culture time point, whereas control cultures displayed a 3-fold decrease. These results demonstrate that MSI2 OE facilitated an ex vivo net 6-fold increase in HSCs relative to control (FIG. 2g, h).",
                                "Secondary LDA transplants were performed to fully explore the effects MSI2 OE and culturing has on self-renewal and long-term HSCs (LT-HSC). Robust engraftment with MSI2 OE showed no evidence of altered myelo-lymphopoiesis or leukemic development (FIG. 2e). Secondary LDA measurements revealed BM GFP+ percentage increased 4.6-fold and LT-HSC frequency 3.5-fold with MSI2 OE compared to controls (FIG. 2d, e, f). This corresponds to MSI2 OE GFP+ HSCs having expanded in primary mice 2.4-fold over input as compared to a decrease of 1.5-fold for control HSCs (FIG. 2g). The level of MSI2 OE-induced in vivo fold expansion remains in line with the behaviour of uncultured HSCs, which undergo similarly controlled expansion during passage in mice (Fares et al., 2014; Cashman et al., 1999; Holyoake et al., 1999). Finally, when accounting for the total change in GFP+ HSCs upon ex vivo culture, MSI2 OE provided a cumulative 23-fold-expansion of secondary LT-HSC relative to control (FIG. 2g, h) indicating elevated MSI2 provides a significant self-renewal advantage to functional HSCs during ex vivo culture.",
                                "To gain mechanistic insights MSI2 OE-induced differentially expressed genes were examined and found Cytochrome P450 1B1 Oxidase (CYP1B1), an effector of AHR signaling (Mimura et al., 2003) amongst the most repressed. Pathway analysis revealed many predicted AHR targets were enriched in MSI2 OE downregulated (FIG. 3a) and MSI2 KD upregulated gene sets (FIG. 11a, b). Binding of the nuclear receptor transcription factor AHR with StemRegenin 1 (SR1) inhibits AHR target gene activation leading to human HSPC expansion in culture (Boitan et al., 2010). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed MSI2 OE downregulated genes significantly matched the SR1 downregulated gene set in an SR1 dose-dependent manner (FIG. 3b, c), whereas MSI2 KD induced the opposite expression profile (FIG. 11c, d). The overlap of downregulated genes with ChIP-seq-identified AHR targets (Lo et al., 2012) was examined. This comparison was extended to downregulated genes upon treatment with UM171, another compound that expands HSPCs independent of AHR (Fares et al., 2014). Direct transcriptional targets of AHR were enriched in the MSI2 OE and SR1 downregulated gene sets by 3.8 and 5.6-fold, respectively compared to UM171, an overrepresentation maintained for predicted AHR targets and one that suggests MSI2 OE expands HSPCs through AHR signaling attenuation (FIG. 3d, FIG. 11e). Furthermore, SR1 treatment increased the percentage of CD34+ cells 8-fold for control cultures compared to only 4-fold with MSI2 OE (FIG. 12a, b), a finding which indicates a redundancy in SR1 and MSI2 OE activity on HSPCs and provides evidence they act on the same pathway.",
                                "To further elucidate the AHR connection, MSI2 OE and control cultures were treated with the AHR agonist 6-Formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ), whose induction of canonical AHR targets in MSI2 OE cells, demonstrates they remain competent for AHR activation (FIG. 12c). Interestingly, FICZ induced a dramatic reversal of the MSI2 OE-mediated increases in primary CFU-GEMMs and their replating capacities (FIG. 3e, f). Furthermore, FICZ-treated MSI2 OE cultures displayed greater losses in phenotypic HSPCs compared to controls which showed no change (FIG. 12d, e). Altogether, these results demonstrate agonist-induced restoration of AHR activity reduces MSI2 OE's pro-self-renewal effects and strongly supports downregulation of AHR signaling as the mechanism through which MSI2 OE achieves HSPC expansion.",
                                "To identify key RNA targets underlying MSI2 function, we analyzed global MSI2 protein-RNA interactions using CLIP-seq (FIG. 13a, b) (Yeo et al., 2009). Mapped reads identified highly correlated gene RPKMs and enrichment of significantly overlapping clusters within >6000 protein-coding genes from replicate experiments (FIG. 13c, FIG. 4a, b). Within the top 40% of reproducible clusters, MSI2 bound predominantly to mature mRNA within their 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) (FIG. 4c). Importantly, 9% of annotated protein-coding genes were reproducible MSI2 targets, compared to 0.2% of long non-coding RNAs (FIG. 13d), suggesting MSI2 controls stability or translation of coding mRNAs. Motif analyses identified a consensus pentamer (U/G)UAGU resembling the known mouse Msi1 binding sequence (Ohyama et al., 2012; Katz et al., 2014) within binding sites in all genic regions and significantly more conserved than background (FIG. 4d, FIG. 13e-h). MSI2 binding sites within Msi1 targets (Katz et al., 2014) indicates Musashi proteins may bind the same genes through 3\u2032UTR-embedded motifs (FIG. 13i). Finally, target gene ontology analysis revealed 186 biological processes categories, among the most significant of which were electron transport, estrogen receptor signaling regulation and metabolism of small molecules, all processes known to be transcriptionally impacted by AHR signaling (Tijet et al., 2006).",
                                "Strikingly, among the top 2% of enriched CLIP-seq targets were the 3\u2032UTRs of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and CYP1B1, two AHR pathway components. Each exhibited multiple MSI2 binding motifs correlating with overlapping clusters of CLIP-seq reads (FIG. 4e, FIG. 14a). Querying MSI2's ability to post-transcriptionally regulate these genes during HSPC expansion, we looked for instances of uncoupled transcript and protein expression. HSP90 displayed uncoupling of transcript (1.6-fold up) and protein (1.6-fold down) early in culture, but at 7 days showed further upregulated transcript (2.5-fold) and variable protein levels (FIG. 4f, FIG. 14b). Since HSP90 binding of AHR is critical for its ligand-dependent transcriptional activity (Mimura et al., 2003), downregulation of HSP90 protein at the outset of HSPC culture would be expected to reduce latent AHR complex formation and attenuate AHR signaling (FIG. 3a). Indeed CYP1B1 transcript and protein displayed 2-fold reductions early in culture, consistent with decreased AHR pathway activity, however at day 7, CYP1B1 transcripts were upregulated 1.7-fold and uncoupled from 2-fold downregulated protein (FIG. 4g, FIG. 14c). To test if MSI2 directly mediates post-transcriptional repression of these targets, CYP1B1 and HSP90 3\u2032UTR regions were coupled to luciferase. MSI2 OE induced significant reductions in luciferase signal from both reporters, an effect mitigated upon mutating the core CLIP-seq-identified UAG motifs (FIG. 14d, e). Since MSI2 OE-mediated post-transcriptional downregulation of the AHR pathway converged on CYP1B1 protein repression throughout culture, the effects of inhibiting CYP1B1 independently with (E)-2,3\u2032,4,5\u2032-Tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) on HSPCs were explored. During culture, TMS increased the frequency and total numbers of CD34+ cells by 1.5- and 2-fold respectively (FIG. 4h, i), phenocopying the effects of MSI2 OE. Lastly, co-overexpression of 3\u2032UTRIess CYP1B1 with MSI2 decreased secondary CFU-GEMM replating efficiency (FIGS. 14f and g) suggesting that CYP1B1, while typically used to report on AHR signaling, itself enforces HSPC differentiation.",
                                "MSI2 has been identified as an important new mediator of human HSPC self-renewal and ex vivo expansion by coordinating the post-transcriptional regulation of proteins belonging to a shared self-renewal regulatory pathway (FIG. 14h)."

Two were found to knockdown CYP1B1 transcript expression to 56% and 39% of what was observed in shControl infected cells. Subsequent experiments were then carried out with the better performing shCYP1B1-C vector in highly CD34+ enriched Lin-CB samples (>60% CD34+). Here the transcript expression was found to be at only 76% the level of what was observed in shControl cells (24% knockdown efficiency, data not shown); suggesting primary cells were more resilient to knockdown compared to cell lines. Nonetheless, it was found that even this modest reduction of CYP1B1 in CB HSPCs enhanced HSPC activity by measurement of primitive CD34 marker expression (FIG. 15B), thus phenocopying effects observed with MSI2 overexpression."

The screening approach used 96-well plates seeded with 1000 FACS-purified CD34+ cells and treatment with 3 concentrations of each compound performed in triplicate culture wells (9 wells total per compound). Cells were cultured for 10 days and resultant growth was measured for cell number and surface marker expression by automated flow cytometer (MACS Quant). Broad HSPC promoting effects were found across multiple compounds of the varying classes and concentrations tested (FIG. 16). Using TMS as a baseline for significant increase in CD34 content (>2-fold % CD34+ at day 10 relative to DMSO), and SR1 as the benchmark for best in class maintenance of CD34 marker expression, 12 compounds were found that met this cut off (\u201cx\u201d marked, FIG. 16) and an additional 4 were found showing a slight improvement over DMSO control (\u201co\u201d marked, >1.5-fold % CD34+ at day 10 relative to DMSO, FIG. 16). Overall, when examining all compounds showing at least a 2-fold higher % CD34+ population, 52% (9/17) flavonoid compounds had a favourable response compared to 25% (2/8) coumarin and 33% (\u2153) alkaloid (FIG. 16). The number of total CD34 for marked cells from a group of cultures that were either responsive or non-responsive with CYP inhibitors (FIG. 16) were examined. It was found that 9 out of 12 compounds that provided a higher frequency of CD34 marked cells and also led to improved yields of total CD34 marked cells (FIG. 17), indicating that these compounds not only maintain primitive HSC marker expression but allow for their sustained numerical expansion."
