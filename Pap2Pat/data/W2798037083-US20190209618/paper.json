    "abstract": "MSI2, which is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), enforces HSPC expansion when overexpressed and is upregulated in myeloid leukemias, indicating its regulated transcription is critical to balanced self-renewal and leukemia restraint. Despite this, little is understood of the factors that enforce appropriate physiological levels of MSI2 in the blood system. Here, we define a promoter region that reports on endogenous expression of MSI2 and identify USF2 and PLAG1 as transcription factors whose promoter binding drives reporter activity. We show that these factors co-regulate, and are required for, efficient transactivation of endogenous MSI2. Coincident overexpression of USF2 and PLAG1 in primitive cord blood cells enhanced MSI2 transcription and yielded cellular phenotypes, including expansion of CD34+ cells in vitro, consistent with that achieved by direct MSI2 overexpression. Global chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses confirm a preferential co-binding of PLAG1 and USF2 at the promoter of MSI2, as well as regulatory regions corresponding to genes with roles in HSPC homeostasis. PLAG1 and USF2 cooperation is thus an important contributor to stem cell-specific expression of MSI2 and HSPC-specific transcriptional circuitry.",

                "The unique ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to self-renew while giving rise to mature cells by differentiation enables their regenerative capacity. As such, identification and characterization of key regulators of this property are of both fundamental and clinical interest. The Musashi-2 (MSI2) RNA-binding protein is now recognized as one such key HSC regulator. Its expression is highest in\u00a0the primitive HSC compartment and progressively decreases upon commitment (de Andres-Aguayo et\u00a0al., 2011, Hope et\u00a0al., 2010, Park et\u00a0al., 2014, Rentas et\u00a0al., 2016). MSI2 loss of function results in a significant depletion in the reconstitution capacity of primitive murine hematopoietic cells (de Andres-Aguayo et\u00a0al., 2011, Hope et\u00a0al., 2010, Ito et\u00a0al., 2010, Park et\u00a0al., 2014). By contrast, when moderately overexpressed, it imparts enhanced HSC self-renewal activity as measured by increased competitiveness in in\u00a0vivo reconstitution assays (Hope et\u00a0al., 2010). In the human system we have shown an analogous detrimental effect on cord blood (CB) HSC-mediated reconstitution when MSI2 is repressed. These same stem cells undergo significant ex\u00a0vivo expansion when MSI2 is overexpressed (Rentas et\u00a0al., 2016). MSI2 has also been implicated in aspects of leukemia pathogenesis (Kharas et\u00a0al., 2010, Park et\u00a0al., 2015, Ito et\u00a0al., 2010). For instance, in mouse models of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), ectopic expression of MSI2 encourages promotion of the disease to acute phases (Kharas et\u00a0al., 2010, Taggart et\u00a0al., 2016). In the human context, aberrantly high expression of MSI2 correlates with more aggressive CML disease states and is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia and MDS (Ito et\u00a0al., 2010, Kharas et\u00a0al., 2010, Taggart et\u00a0al., 2016). Taken together, these studies suggest that the precise molecular regulation of MSI2 gene expression may be among the critical mechanisms underlying balanced HSC self-renewal/differentiation and the restraint of leukemia progression. Despite the importance of MSI2 in stem cell behavior, it remains poorly understood how MSI2 expression is maintained at appropriate levels, and very little is known of the promoter elements or transcription factors (TFs) that mediate this. Here, we report an approach to address HSC cell fate control through the systematic dissection of the MSI2 promoter functional in hematopoietic cells. Through this strategy, we have identified two TFs that function as cooperative regulators of MSI2 and that together play a key role in HSPC function."

                        "MSI2 expression is evolutionarily conserved in both mouse and human HSPCs. Therefore, as an initial step in mapping its promoter we concentrated on the region directly upstream of the translational start site sharing extensive sequence similarity between the two species. This corresponded to a region extending to \u223c3.2 kb upstream wherein homology peaks were detected throughout as identified by the multiple sequence local alignment and visualization tool (MULAN) (Ovcharenko et\u00a0al., 2004) (Figure\u00a01A, middle panel). Multiple sequence features including a nuclease accessible site (NAS), CpG island, and TF binding sites as identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) within a conserved region \u223c1 kb upstream of the translational start site further suggested the potential for this region to function in a promoter capacity (Figure\u00a01A). Introduction of this 3.2 kb region upstream of firefly luciferase in pGL3-basic yielded significantly greater reporter activity compared with the\u00a0promoterless construct in MSI2-expressing K562 and HEK293 cell lines (3-fold and 7.5-fold respectively) (Figure\u00a01A, data not shown). Using variations in the extent of homology peaks as endpoints, we generated a set of luciferase reporter constructs with serial 5\u2032-truncations of the \u223c3.2 kb sequence. A significant drop in reporter activity resulted only when the upstream sequence driving reporter expression was reduced from \u2212588 to \u2212203\u00a0bp (Figure\u00a01A). In confirmation that a minimal promoter region containing essential cis elements governing MSI2 expression is contained within this 385\u00a0bp region we found its deletion from the full-length 3.2 kb fragment was sufficient to repress luciferase activity to the level of the promoterless reporter (Figure\u00a01A).Figure\u00a01In Silico Mapping and Mutagenesis Screening Identifies the MSI2 Promoter in Hematopoietic Cells with Dependence on USF2 and PLAG1 Binding Sites for Activity(A) UCSC genome browser annotation of features within the region directly 5\u2032 upstream of MSI2 (top panel) including ChIP-validated transcription factor (TF) binding sites, a CpG island, and nuclease accessible site (NAS).

                        "We next implemented a mutagenesis screen to systematically test the functionality of TF consensus sites within the minimal promoter region in order to pinpoint key MSI2-regulators. First we used in silico TF binding site prediction (MatInspector) to identify a total of 107 TF candidates representing 65 different TF families. From within this set we removed those TFs not appreciably expressed in both murine and human HSPCs, where MSI2 expression is known to be concentrated. A final refinement based on an extensive literature search to identify novel TFs, or those implicated in the regulation of stem cell function and/or leukemia, yielded a list of ten candidate regulators of primitive hematopoietic cell expression of MSI2 (Figures 1B and\u00a01C). Using the \u2212588-Luc reporter construct as a template we generated a series of constructs possessing mutations of the consensus binding sites of each of these TFs and screened for loss of luciferase reporter activity (Figures 1D and 1E). The only TFs whose binding site mutagenesis resulted in a significant reduction in reporter activity were the E-box motif-binding USF2 and the C2H2 zinc finger protein PLAG1 (Figure\u00a01E). The results of our rationalized screen thus indicate that intact PLAG1 and USF2 binding sites are required for full MSI2 promoter activity."

                        "The minimal MSI2 promoter sequence contains a total of three consensus E-box motifs for USF2 (Bendall and Molloy, 1994) and three G-rich bipartite consensus sequences for PLAG1 (Hensen et\u00a0al., 2002) (Figure\u00a02A). In support of\u00a0the functionality of these binding sites, ChIP-qPCR demonstrated that PLAG1 and USF2 yield significant fold enrichment at the minimal promoter region of MSI2 in K562 cells (Figure\u00a02B). Combined with the mutagenesis data, these results are consistent with the direct binding of USF2 and PLAG1 to their consensus recognition elements as requirements for full activity of the MSI2 minimal\u00a0promoter. To quantify the transactivation potential of\u00a0USF2 and/or PLAG1 on the promoter region we independently overexpressed each gene. USF2-overexpressing\u00a0(USF2) cells exhibited a significant 40% (1.4-fold) enhanced reporter activity compared with vector controls (Figures 2C and 2D). In addition, USF2-overexpressing cells did not exhibit any elevation of luciferase reporter levels when transfected with a promoter construct that had mutations in all three USF2 binding sites, further confirming the specificity of USF2 binding to the predicted sites (Figure\u00a02E). Lastly, USF2 overexpression resulted in a 1.4-fold increased MSI2 transcript level compared with negative controls. Binding to the E-box motif within the MSI2 promoter and transactivation of MSI2 expression is specific to USF2 as its closely related family member, USF1, does not bind the MSI2 promoter (Figure\u00a02B) and yielded no increase in MSI2 expression when overexpressed (Figure\u00a02F). Together, these results validate the reporter results and confirm the direct connection of USF2 levels with endogenous MSI2 expression.Figure\u00a02Ectopic PLAG1 and USF2 Bind the MSI2 Promoter and Enhance Its Transcription in K562 Cells(A) DNA sequence of the minimal promoter for MSI2 with predicted (MatInspector) USF2 (blue) and PLAG1 (red) binding sites shown.

                        "There are three human PLAG1 transcript variants encoding two protein isoforms. The larger isoform (PLAG1-A) contains all annotated functional domains, whereas the shorter form (PLAG1-B) is missing Zn fingers F1 and F2. A\u00a0third reported slightly smaller PLAG1 translational isoform\u00a0exists through translation from methionine 100 (PLAG1-S), is missing the first 17 N-terminal residues of PLAG1-B, and thus co-migrates with it on SDS-PAGE (Debiec-Rychter et\u00a0al., 2001) (Figures 2G and S1). In both K562 and primary primitive human CB cells, PLAG1 appears to be contributed largely by the short-form(s) (Figures 2G and 2H). Thus to characterize their respective contributions to MSI2 transactivation we overexpressed PLAG1-B and PLAG1-S or the negative control USF1 in K562 cells (Figure\u00a02I). Both PLAG1 forms independently enhanced reporter activity \u223c1.4 fold in a PLAG1-binding-site-dependent manner (Figures 2J and 2K) and, most importantly, resulted in a significant 1.6-fold increase in endogenous MSI2 transcription, suggesting they behave interchangeably with respect to MSI2 regulation (Figure\u00a02L). Together, these findings indicate that both USF2 and PLAG1 directly interact with the MSI2 minimal promoter and are capable of ectopically transactivating its expression.",
                        "Reciprocal knockdown experiments with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting USF2 and PLAG1 resulted in a 40% and 50% decrease in endogenous MSI2 transcription, respectively, in comparison with control cells expressing non-targeting shRNA (shLuc) (Figures 3A\u20133C). In addition, we measured the effects of PLAG1 loss of function using a dominant-negative approach wherein we introduced short PLAG1 forms missing their transactivation domains (Kas et\u00a0al., 1998, Voz et\u00a0al., 2000) (PLAG1-B DN and PLAG1-S-DN, respectively) (Figure\u00a03D). The introduction of either\u00a0form led to the attenuation of MSI2 transcription by approximately 1.4-fold compared with controls (Figure\u00a03D). These results confirm that PLAG1 transactivation activity is a requirement for maintenance of physiological levels of MSI2 transcription. In summary, these gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrate that USF2 and PLAG1 constitute critical components of the regulatory circuitry controlling MSI2 transcription and are essential for maintaining physiological MSI2 expression levels.Figure\u00a03PLAG1 and USF2 Are Required for MSI2 Promoter Activity and Expression(A and B).

                        "We next tested whether Plag1 and USF2 cooperate to transactivate MSI2 expression. First we generated a minimal promoter reporter assay containing mutations in both the PLAG1 and USF2 consensus sites. Combinatorial binding site mutagenesis yielded a more significant reduction in minimal promoter activity than when PLAG1 or USF2 binding sites were mutated in isolation (Figure\u00a04A). As this suggested that USF2 and PLAG1 potentially cooperate to regulate MSI2 promoter activity we sought to further address this possibility using PLAG1-S and USF2 co-overexpression in K562 cells. Luciferase activity following co-overexpression was approximately 2-fold greater than in negative controls and over 1.5-fold greater than in cells overexpressing either USF2 or PLAG1-S alone (Figure\u00a04B). In addition, the same assay performed in singly and doubly USF2- and PLAG1-S-overexpressing cells transfected with\u00a0promoter reporter constructs with co-mutated USF2/PLAG1 binding sites demonstrated background level reporter activity, confirming the specificity of the predicted binding sites (data not shown and Figure\u00a04C). Strikingly, co-overexpression increased endogenous MSI2 transcription more than 4.5-fold in comparison with vector transfected control cells, an increase that was also manifested at the protein level (Figures 4D and 4E). This robust increase in MSI2 transcription is more than 2.5-fold higher than that observed in cells overexpressing USF2 or PLAG1-S independently, indicating a potential synergistic response on wholesale MSI2 transactivation when the two factors are coordinately elevated. To assess the nature of their collaboration on the minimal promoter of MSI2 we performed reporter assays in single factor overexpressing cells carrying the promoter sequence containing mutations of the alternate factor's consensus sites. We find that when USF2 binding sites are mutated, transactivation by PLAG1 is unaffected, whereas when PLAG1 binding sites are mutated transactivation of the promoter by USF2 is\u00a0attenuated by more than 2-fold (Figure\u00a04F). This is intriguingly suggestive of a requisite role for PLAG1 in the recruitment of cooperative TFs. To further characterize the potential cooperation between PLAG1 and USF2 we used co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) to test whether the two TFs are involved in a protein-protein interaction and found that they are not engaged in an interaction detectable by coIP (Figure\u00a04G). Thus, although PLAG1 and USF2 exhibit an epistatic relationship, these data suggest that PLAG1 and USF2 do so in the absence of forming a direct, stable physical interaction.Figure\u00a04PLAG1-S and USF2 Collaboratively Regulate MSI2 Promoter Activity and MSI2 Expression(A) Reporter activity upon combinatorial binding site mutagenesis for USF2 and PLAG1 within the MSI2 minimal promoter region. n\u00a0= 11 independent experiments.(B) Reporter construct luciferase activity upon independent or coincident overexpression of USF2 and PLAG1-S (n\u00a0= 3 experiments).(C) Luciferase activity of PLAG1 and USF2 MUT reporters upon PLAG1-S and USF2 co-overexpression (n\u00a0= 3 experiments).(D and E) Endogenous MSI2 transcript (D) (n\u00a0= 3 experiments) and protein levels (E) following overexpression of PLAG1-S and USF2 in K562 cells compared with vector control.(F) Luciferase reporter activity of the MSI2 minimal promoter region upon PLAG1-S or USF2 overexpression when the binding site for the reciprocal factor or for both factors is mutated (MUT) (n\u00a0= 3 experiments).(G) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis performed on K562 cells using anti-USF2 for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with antibodies to USF2, the known USF2 interacting partner USF1 or PLAG1.Data are presented as means \u00b1 SEM. \u2217p\u00a0< 0.05, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.01, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.001.

                        "If the cooperative effect of USF2 and PLAG1 is indeed a key component in driving MSI2 expression in primary hematopoietic cells, it would be expected that maximal MSI2 expression would be observed in cells where the combined levels of these two factors peak. Indeed, this is the case, as USF2 is ubiquitously expressed across the human hematopoietic hierarchy, while PLAG1 is at its highest levels in the most primitive HSC subset and declines rapidly in expression with differentiation (Figure\u00a05A), a profile that is also consistent with MSI2 expression (Rentas et\u00a0al., 2016). Moreover, we confirmed PLAG1-B isoform expression follows the same pattern of being more highly expressed in HSC enriched CB populations (Figure\u00a05B). To support that this maximal presence of PLAG1 in combination with USF2 in more primitive hematopoietic cells translates to an increase in actual MSI2 promoter binding we performed ChIP to examine PLAG1 and USF2 binding to the \u2212588\u00a0bp region of Lin-CD34+ HSPCs and Lin-CD34-restricted progenitors. ChIP-qPCR demonstrated that PLAG1 and USF2 do indeed directly bind to the MSI2 promoter with more than 4.5- and 2.5-fold enrichment, respectively, in Lin-CD34+ compared with Lin-CD34-cells (Figure\u00a05C). Furthermore, selective knockdown of PLAG1 in Lin-CD34+ cells results in a 60% down-regulation of\u00a0MSI2 transcript validating the PLAG1-dependent nature\u00a0of MSI2 expression in primitive hematopoietic cells (Figure\u00a05D).Figure\u00a05PLAG1-S and USF2 Co-regulate MSI2 Expression and Its Downstream Functions in Primitive Hematopoietic Cells(A) Expression profile of PLAG1 and USF2 in the human hematopoietic hierarchy.

ChIP-seq peak calling revealed that USF2 and PLAG1 occupied a total of 2,409 and 21,469 sites, respectively (Figure\u00a0S2E). To evaluate the likely biological impact, we assayed for co-binding within a stringent 100\u00a0bp window and found a statistically significant association of USF2 binding with PLAG1 sites as the majority (56%) of USF2 regions (1,386 sites) were accompanied by PLAG1 binding (Figure\u00a06A, p value 2.2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u221216 by Fisher's exact test; Table S1A). We noted that USF2-PLAG1 (PLAG1\u00a0+ USF2) co-occupancy typically occurred at promoter regions, with \u223c70% of peaks detected within 3 kb of a transcription start site (TSS) (Figure\u00a06B). These peaks also show a strong distribution centered at the TSS supporting the role of USF2 and PLAG1 as TFs at these locations (Figure\u00a06C). We next performed de novo motif discovery on sites bound by USF2 or PLAG1. Analysis of the USF2 bound sites uncovered the expected E-box motif for USF2 as the most significantly enriched, as well as a second, less frequent G-rich motif. The motif discovery for PLAG1 revealed not only the G-rich core consensus binding motif recognized by PLAG family members (Voz et\u00a0al., 1998) but also identified an E-box containing consensus sequence bound with an equivalent frequency to the PLAG1 G-rich core consensus (Figure\u00a06D). The motif distribution profile of the USF2 consensus at the center of PLAG1 peaks (Figure\u00a06E) provide further support for the concept that PLAG1 can associate with regions of chromatin to which USF2 would be expected to show an affinity and echoes the preferential co-localization of these two factors at selected genomic loci as quantified above.Figure\u00a06ChIP-Seq Mapping of USF2 and PLAG1-S Binding Identifies Co-occupancy at Promoters of MSI2 and Other HSC Regulators(A) Venn diagram showing the overlap of USF2 and PLAG1-S ChIP peaks within a 100\u00a0bp distance.(B) Peak distribution profiles of all PLAG1-S and USF2 peaks, along with the co-occupied sites (PLAG1-S\u00a0+ USF2).(C) Read distribution profiles of peaks found within \u00b13 kb of the TSS.(D) De novo motif discovery analysis of the PLAG1-S and USF2 peaks.

                        "We next sought to explore whether USF2 and PLAG1 regulate HSC-specific genes and/or pathways. Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) we created ranked lists with publicly available gene expression profiles assembled from sub-fractions of the human hematopoietic hierarchy ranging from primitive (Lin-CD34+) to mature (Lin+) (Beck et\u00a0al., 2013) and then used the 621 genes associated with the most high-confidence USF2-PLAG1 co-bound promoters (peak scores >200) as the gene set. Interestingly, we found no significant enrichment of HSC-specific gene promoters being bound by the two factors (Figure\u00a0S2F). Furthermore, the USF2-PLAG1 co-bound sites did not show a significant enrichment of a separate HSC stem/progenitor\u00a0gene set (Ivanova et\u00a0al., 2002) (Figure\u00a0S2F). Despite this, however, we did observe promoter co-occupancy\u00a0for\u00a0a\u00a0number of recognized HSC regulators, including DNMT3A, SOCS2, HOXA1, and MSI2 (Figure\u00a06F, Table\u00a0S1A). Strikingly, MSI2 is the only factor in this list of\u00a0promoters co-bound by USF2 and PLAG1-S that is documented as capable of expanding human HSC, and the identification of MSI2 in this independent ChIP-seq experiment provides key support of our earlier findings in this study. Interestingly, upon Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of those genes that show co-occupancy, there was an abundance of genes involved in autophagy, a pathway important for stem cell control and homeostasis in the blood system (Ho et\u00a0al., 2017, Mortensen et\u00a0al., 2011) (Figures 6G and 6H, Tables S1B and S1C). Finally, performing unbiased GSEA we also find that USF2-PLAG1 co-occupied genes are positively enriched for those involved in cell cycle, membrane transport, RNA processing, and infectious diseases (Table S1D). Together these results suggest that a subset of PLAG1-USF2 bound sites are in fact localized to promoter regions with relevance to stem cell regulation as well as other genes whose involvement in the function of these two factors will now be of interest to explore further. Thus, we show that in the HSC context the co-ordinate regulation by USF2 and PLAG1 of these genes, in conjunction with MSI2, provides complementary mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of stemness features."

                "To date, we have little knowledge of the endogenous regulators of MSI2 transcription in the human HSPC compartment. Given the powerful role MSI2 plays in promoting HSPC self-renewal, identifying MSI2 activators and their mechanism of action is required before their regenerative potential can be fully harnessed. Here, we have identified USF2 and PLAG1 as being both necessary, and, together, sufficient for significant transcriptional activation of MSI2. This discovery advances the understanding of how stem cell fate is propagated via the master regulator MSI2. In addition to describing a role for USF2 and PLAG1, our study provides key insights into the nature of their regulatory action. We observed that PLAG1 and USF2 appear to function additively on the MSI2 promoter, but synergistically on actual MSI2 transcription, which implies additional regulatory mechanisms act on the state of native chromatin through which these factors associate to further elevate transactivation. Indeed, our findings indicate that the competency of PLAG1 binding is dominant over that of USF2 at the MSI2 promoter. Of note, our ChIP-seq analysis identified the G-rich consensus sequence previously described for PLAG1 (Voz et\u00a0al., 1998) but also reveals that PLAG1 occupancy is frequently found at sites containing or surrounding an E-box motif that is highly similar to that bound by USF2. These data offer the possibility that PLAG1 could be an important nucleator for subsequent USF2 binding, the precise mechanism of which will now require more in-depth exploration. To this point, the specific sequence, occupancy status, and, by extension, shape of genomic regions proximal to E-boxes are known to modulate USF binding specificity (Gordan et\u00a0al., 2013). Thus, the possibility that PLAG1 binding at or proximal to E-box motifs establishes a local structural configuration that is favorable to USF2 binding presents an attractive subject for subsequent exploration. The feasibility of PLAG1 acting to facilitate a permissive local environment for USF2 binding is supported by recent work on the related PLAG family member PLAGL1, which has highlighted the potential for PLAGL1 to display aspects of \u201cpioneer factor\u201d behavior (Varrault et\u00a0al., 2017).",
                "Our attempts to measure a direct interaction between PLAG1 and USF2 by coIP did not detect such a relationship, but it is important to point out that a negative coIP result does not preclude PLAG1 and USF2 having direct physical interaction or indirect cooperativity. Indeed, transcriptional control mechanisms are often complex, involving myriad co-factor interactions, and occur in the context of highly structured chromatin and often with dynamic kinetics (Morgunova and Taipale, 2017). As such, dissection of the physical and mechanistic relationship between PLAG1 and USF2 at regions of co-regulation is beyond the scope of our study but presents a priority topic for future study. However, our identification of PLAG1 and USF2 as key mediators of MSI2 regulation improves our understanding of the upstream mechanism that controls HSPC maintenance and expansion.",
                "Our work also supplements the current understanding on the nature of USF2 action in HSPCs. USF2 is known to regulate a number of diverse biological processes but has also previously been shown to regulate HOXB4 expression in human hematopoietic cells, via association with the primitive cell enriched-TF NF-Ya (Giannola et\u00a0al., 2000, Zhu et\u00a0al., 2003). We found that USF2, when co-expressed with PLAG1, is bound to the promoter of HOXA1, which has been shown to promote self-renewal of murine HSPCs (Bach et\u00a0al., 2010, Fabb et\u00a0al., 2004). Thus, in addition to\u00a0hinting that USF2 may have a larger potential to function in combination with other, more HSC-restricted factors in the regulation of stemness genes, these findings also\u00a0suggest that USF2 may play a larger role in HOX gene regulation.",
                "PLAG1 was initially discovered in human pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary gland as a proto-oncogene (Debiec-Rychter et\u00a0al., 2001, Kas et\u00a0al., 1997, Voz et\u00a0al., 1998). Here, we have expanded the repertoire of PLAG1 functionality into the maintenance of HSPCs. We have shown that it is the selective expression of PLAG1 within the most primitive cells of the blood system (Gazit et\u00a0al., 2013) that enables it to function in co-ordination with the ubiquitously expressed USF2, ensuring appropriate elevated expression of MSI2 in these cells. Our findings position PLAG1 as a key transcriptional regulator of HSPC in its own right. We have shown that USF2 and PLAG1 work cooperatively, but the large pool of binding sites for PLAG1 that do not overlap with USF2 may regulate genomic targets beyond which we can study here. In combination with the markedly enriched expression of PLAG1 in HSCs, this may hint at a larger USF2-independent role for PLAG1 in the control of HSC function, a topic that will now be important to explore in future studies."

The transcriptional start site is predicted to be 173 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. 5\u2032-Serial truncations were generated using primers listed in Table S2A. TFs predicted by MatInspector (Quandt et\u00a0al., 1995) to bind the human 385\u00a0bp minimal MSI2 promoter were retained for comparison against publicly available databases of global gene expression profiles of diverse hematopoietic subpopulations to facilitate a final selection of genes that are expressed in primitive mouse and human HSCs (Bagger et\u00a0al., 2016, Heng and Painter, 2008, Jojic et\u00a0al., 2013, Novershtern et\u00a0al., 2011). For subsequent promoter mutagenesis screening we prioritized TFs that (1) had commercially available antibodies, (2) are expressed in K562s, (3) are known to be expressed in other stem cell types and/or to regulate their homeostasis, and (4) exhibit binding sites that are conserved in the MSI2 promoter region shared between human and mouse. Predicted TF binding sites were mutated by rolling circle site-directed mutagenesis (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2004). Primers and nucleotide substitutions are provided in Table S2B.
