                        "Advances in stem cell technology, such as the isolation and propagation in vitro of primordial stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (\u201cES\u201d cells including human ES cells (\u201chES\u201d cells)) and related primordial stem cells including but not limited to, iPS, EG, EC, ICM, epiblast, or ED cells (including said cells from the human species), constitute an important new area of medical research and therapeutic product development. Many of these primordial stem cells are naturally telomerase positive in the undifferentiated state, thereby allowing the cells to be expanded extensively and subsequently genetically modified and clonally expanded after said genetic modification prior to differentiation. Telomere length in many of the primordial cells lines is comparable to that observed in sperm DNA (approximately 10-18 kb TRF length) through in part the expression of the catalytic component of telomerase (TERT). Therefore, while differentiated progeny of the primordial stem cells are typically mortal due to the repression of TERT expression and telomere length shortens with cell doubling, their long initial telomere lengths provide the cells with a long replicative capacity compared to fetal or adult-derived cells.",
                        "Human ES cells have a demonstrated potential to be propagated in the undifferentiated state and then to be subsequently induced to differentiate into any and all of the cell types in the human body, including complex tissues. The pluripotency of hES cells has led to the suggestion that many diseases resulting from dysfunction of cells may be amenable to treatment by the administration of hES-derived cells of various differentiated types (Thomson et al., Science 282:1145-1147 (1998)), and the long proliferative lifespan of hES-derived progenitor lines has allowed the clonal expansion and initial characterization of hES cell-derived embryonic progenitor cell lines (West et al, Regen Med (2008) 3(3), 287-308).",
                        "Nuclear transfer studies have demonstrated that it is possible to transform a somatic differentiated cell back to a primordial stem cell state such as that of embryonic stem (\u201cES\u201d) cells (Cibelli et al., Nature Biotech 16:642-646 (1998)) or embryo-derived (\u201cED\u201d) cells. Technologies to reprogram somatic cells back to a totipotent ES cell state, such as by the transfer of the genome of the somatic cell to an enucleated oocyte and the subsequent culture of the reconstructed embryo to yield ES cells, often referred to as somatic cell nuclear transfer (\u201cSCNT\u201d) or through analytical reprogramming technology wherein somatic cells are reprogrammed using transcriptional regulators (see PCT application Ser. No. PCT/US2006/030632 filed on Aug. 3, 2006 and titled \u201cImproved Methods of Reprogramming Animal Somatic Cells\u201d) have been described. These methods offer potential strategies to transplant primordial-derived somatic cells with a nuclear genotype of the patient (Lanza et al., Nature Medicine 5:975-977 (1999)).",
                        "In addition to SCNT and analytical reprogramming technologies, other techniques exist to address the problem of transplant rejection, including the use of gynogenesis and androgenesis (see U.S. application No. 60/161,987, filed Oct. 28, 1999; Ser. No. 09/697,297, filed Oct. 27, 2000; Ser. No. 09/995,659, filed Nov. 29, 2001; Ser. No. 10/374,512, filed Feb. 27, 2003; PCT application no. PCT/US00/29551, filed Oct. 27, 2000). In the case of a type of gynogenesis designated parthenogenesis, pluripotent stem cells may be manufactured without antigens foreign to the gamete donor and therefore useful in manufacturing cells that can be transplanted without rejection into the gamete donor. In addition, parthenogenic stem cell lines can be assembled into a bank of cell lines homozygous in the HLA region (or corresponding MHC region of nonhuman animals) to reduce the complexity of a stem cell bank in regard to HLA haplotypes.",
                        "Cell lines or a bank of said cell lines can be produced that are hemizygous in the region of the chromatin containing the HLA genes (or corresponding MHC region of nonhuman animals; see PCT application Ser. No. PCT/US2006/040985 filed Oct. 20, 2006 entitled \u201cTotipotent, Nearly Totipotent or Pluripotent Mammalian Cells Homozygous or Hemizygous for One or More Histocompatibility Antigen Genes\u201d). A bank of hemizygous cell lines provides the advantage of not only reducing the complexity inherent in the normal mammalian MHC gene pool, but it also reduces the gene dosage of the antigens to reduce the expression of said antigens without eliminating their expression entirely, thus avoiding stimulation of a natural killer response.",
                        "In addition to reprogramming by SCNT or analytical reprogramming technologies such as iPS cell generation, the pluripotent stem cells may be genetically modified to reduce immunogenicity through the modulation of expression of certain genes such as the knockout of HLA genes, one of both alleles of beta 2 microglobulin (B2M), increased expression of HLA-G or HLA-H, or CTLA4-Ig and PD-L1 (Z. Rong et al, An Effective Approach to Prevent Immune Rejection of Human ESC-Derived Allografts, Cell Stem Cell, 14: 121-130 (2014) incorporated herein by reference, as well as other modifications known in the art and subsequently used to generate differentiated cells for research and therapeutic applications. Such genetically-modified promoridial stem cells designed to produce cells with reduced immunogenicity are designated \u201cuniversal donor cells\u201d herein.",
                        "In regard to differentiating primordial stem cells into desired cell types, the potential to isolate human pluripotent stem cell-derived clonal embryonic progenitor cell lines provides a means to propagate novel highly purified cell lineages with a prenatal pattern of gene expression useful for regenerating tissues. Such cell types have important applications in research, and for the manufacture of cell-based therapies (see PCT application Ser. No. PCT/US2006/013519 filed on Apr. 11, 2006 and entitled \u201cNovel Uses of Cells With Prenatal Patterns of Gene Expression\u201d; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/604,047 filed on Nov. 21, 2006 and entitled \u201cMethods to Accelerate the Isolation of Novel Cell Strains from Pluripotent Stem Cells and Cells Obtained Thereby\u201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/504,630 filed on Jul. 16, 2009 and entitled \u201cMethods to Accelerate the Isolation of Novel Cell Strains from Pluripotent Stem Cells and Cells Obtained Thereby\u201d); U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/048,910 entitled \u201cDifferentiated Progeny of Clonal Progenitor Cell Lines,\u201d incorporated herein by reference. Clonal, oligoclonal, and pooled populations of clonal and oligoclonal embryonic progenitors capable of forming embryonic cutaneous adipocyte progenitor cells (ECAPCs) expressing EYA4, wherein said progenitor cells are capable of differentiating into certain cellular components of brown adipose tissue (BAT) have also been disclosed (see WO2011/150105 entitled \u201cImproved Methods of Screening Embryonic Progenitor Cell Lines,\u201d) as well as (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/683,241, entitled \u201cMethods of Screening Embryonic Progenitor Cell Lines\u201d).",
                        "Despite of the advances described above, there remains a need to improve methods for screening pluripotent stem cell-derived cells for potential of differentiation into desired cell types, including the cellular components of BAT. There also remains a need for means to effectively differentiate pluripotent stem cells into site-specific progenitor and terminally differentiated cell types. Moreover, there is a growing need for improved methods for generating progenitor cell types from pluripotent stem cells that display and maintain a uniform differentiated state and exhibit site-specific differences in gene expression. Adipocytes are an example of a cell type with important site-specific differences in gene expression, with diverse types of adipocytes within the human body each having unique roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. While adipocytes in general provide a physiological function of storing energy for future metabolic needs, a specialized type of adipose tissue called brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates energy expenditure or thermogenesis. BAT cells are progressively lost during the development and aging of humans, consequently increasing the risk of disorders where BAT cells play a critical role (such as in regulating fat metabolism in the body, blood pressure, blood glucose regulation, pancreatic beta cell numbers in the pancreas, and HDL and LDL lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism) in the populations with less BAT. Thus, a need exists for generating purified adipocyte progenitors capable of differentiating into site-specific adipocytes of diverse tissue types, including BAT cells.",
                        "Surprisingly, the methods of the present invention demonstrate that distinct pluripotent stem cell-derived clonal embryonic progenitor cell lines can be isolated which when cultured and expanded in the undifferentiated state do not express high levels of adipocyte markers and do not express detectable levels of markers of BAT adipocytes such as the gene UCP1 or the adipokine ADIPOQ, but nevertheless, under certain conditions disclosed herein, are capable of differentiating into either: 1) UCP1-expressing brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells that express low to undetectable adipokines such as C19orf80 (also known betatrophin or ANGPTL8, encoded in humans by the C19orf80 gene), and adiponectin (also known as AdipoQ or GBP-28, encoded in humans by the ADIPOQ gene) or 2) clonal embryonic progenitors capable of making adipocytes that express abundant mRNA for C19orf80 and adiponectin, but low levels of UCP1. In addition, surprisingly, the methods of the present invention demonstrate that the pluripotent stem cell-derived clonal embryonic progenitor cell line ESI EP004 NP 110SM (also referred to as NP 110SM) which can be cultured and expanded in a relatively undifferentiated state that does not express pluripotency markers or express high levels of adipocyte markers and does not express detectable levels of markers of BAT adipocytes such as C19orf80, adiponectin or UCP1, nevertheless, when differentiated using the methods of the present invention, is capable of simultaneously expressing levels of UCP1, C19orf80, and ADIPOQ at levels comparable or higher to cultured fetal-tissue derived BAT cells.",
                        "There is a need for methods that permit the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into particular progenitor cell types capable of making the cellular components of brown fat that can be effectively and reproducibly dosed in cell therapy regimens that result in the engraftment of viable and functional BAT cells useful in the treatment of the symptoms of adiposity, Type I and Type II diabetes, hypertension, and diseases associated with endothelial cell dysfunction including coronary disease syndromes where many of these disorders occur simultaneously in a patient (such as metabolic syndrome X and related disorders as described herein). Moreover, there is a need for progenitor cell types and terminally differentiated cell types with expression of physiologically-beneficial genes including, but not limited to, UCP1, C19orf80 and ADIPOQ, and formulating said cells such that they may be stably engrafted subcutaneously and may deliver such adipokines and beneficial factors systemically to increase insulin sensitivity, decrease total body fat, decrease symptoms of Type I and Type II diabetes, favorably impact the course of coronary disease, and treat metabolic syndrome X. Lastly, there exists a need for a biocompatible matrix that facilitates the differentiation of embryonic progenitors into adipocytes, to promote the permanent engraftment of said cells in suitable sites in the body, and limit the undesired migration of said brown fat cellular components sites when injected in vivo.",

The ES cells may be derived from the in vitro fertilization of an egg cell with sperm or DNA, nuclear transfer, parthenogenesis, or by means to generate hES cells with hemizygosity or homozygosity in the MHC region. While ES cells have historically been defined as cells capable of differentiating into all of the somatic cell types as well as germ line when transplanted into a preimplantation embryo, candidate ES cultures from many species, including human, have a more flattened appearance in culture and typically do not contribute to germ line differentiation, and are therefore called \u201cES-like cells.\u201d It is commonly believed that human ES cells are in reality \u201cES-like\u201d, however, in this application we will use the term ES cells to refer to both ES and ES-like cell lines.",

Adiponectin modulates a number of metabolic processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid oxidation. Adiponectin is secreted from adipose tissue into the bloodstream, where levels of the hormone are inversely correlated with body fat percentage, type II diabetes, and coronary disease.

C19orf80 is a putative peptide hormone that was found to increase the rate at which pancreatic beta cells undergo cell division in mice (Yi et al, Betatrophin: a hormone that controls pancreatic \u03b2 cell proliferation, Cell. 2013 May 9; 153(4):747-58). Injection of mice with betatrophin cDNA resulted in lowered blood sugar levels, presumably due to action at the pancreatic islet cells.

                        "This invention solves the problem of generating large populations of highly purified cellular components of human brown adipose tissue by showing how to efficiently differentiate them from pluripotent stem cells.",
                        "Pluripotent stem (pPS) cells such as human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) cells, human embryonic stem (hES) cells, and human parthenogenetic pluripotent stem cells (hPPS) cells and other cells with the potential of pluripotency, can be differentiated into normal functional cellular components of BAT on an industrial scale by first initiating general differentiation under certain defined conditions described herein, and then expanding clonal embryonic progenitor cells or pooled clonal embryonic progenitor cells, or oligoclonal embryonic progenitor cells that can simply be expanded in cell culture as adherent cells in traditional cell culture vessels or attached to beads in a slurry, cryopreserved, and expanded again, and then differentiated using the techniques described herein to generate cellular components of BAT useful for research and therapy. A strategy has been developed that helps optimize the combination of factors that are useful in the above-mentioned manufacturing technology. The techniques of this invention are oriented at producing a population of highly-enriched cells capable of differentiating into ADIPOQ, C19orf80, and UCP1-expressing BAT cells.",
                        "The development of methods to efficiently produce BAT cells from hES cells is important, because hES cells can be caused to proliferate indefinitely and can be genetically modified to allow the introduction of genetic modifications that allow the generation of off-the-shelf allogeneic cells that can then yield industrial scale manufacture of the desired therapeutically-useful differentiated cell type providing a means is known to manufacture said differentiated cell type with requisite standards of purity and identity. Accordingly, this invention provides a system that can be used to generate unbounded quantities of BAT cells.",
                        "The disclosure that follows provides a full description of how to make the BAT cells of this invention. It provides extensive illustrations of how these cells can be used in research and pharmaceutical development. The disclosure also provides pharmaceutical compositions, devices, and treatment methods for the use of pluripotent stem cell-derived BAT cells for regeneration and remodeling of BAT to restore youthful fat, lipoprotein, and glucose metabolism.",
                        "There is a growing need for improved methods of generating progenitor cell types from ES and iPS cells that display and maintain a uniform differentiated state, and exhibit site-specific homeobox gene expression. Adipocytes are an example of cell types with important site-specific differences in gene expression. The diverse types of adipocytes within the developed human body each have unique roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis. For example, subcutaneous fat differs in numerous aspects from visceral fat. In the case of subcutaneous fat, there are varieties of site-specific adipocytes that also differ from one another. While adipocytes in general provide a physiological function in storing energy for future metabolic needs, a specialized type of adipose tissue called brown adipose tissue (BAT) or simply \u201cbrown fat\u201d, commonly restricted to the dorsal aspect of mammals such as between the scapulae in young mammals, or in the superclaviclar or cervical or region, differs in several respects from the white adipocytes in subcutaneous fat elsewhere in the body. Metabolically active BAT has been reported to be detectable in adult humans as assayed by PET/CT using as an imaging agent the glucose analog F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET/CT) (van der Lans et al, \u201cCold-activated brown adipose tissue in human adults: methodological issues\u201d Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol, 2014, Jul. 15; 307(2)R103-13)).",
                        "In the last 20 years, BAT has been discovered to function as a thermogenic as well as an organ that regulates energy, lipid, and lipoprotein metabolism. Brown fat cells are highly innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and BAT thermogenesis is almost exclusively under SNS innervation control (Cannon et al, \u201cBrown adipose tissue function and physiological significance\u201d Physiol Rev. 2004, 84, 277-359). BAT can further function as an endocrine organ generating critical adipokines such as adiponectin (also known as AdipoQ, GBP-28 or aPM1, encoded in humans by the ADIPOQ gene,), and C19orf80 (also known betatrophin or ANGPTL8, encoded in humans by the C19orf80 gene) (Shehzad et al, \u201cAdiponectin:regulation of its production and its role in human diseases\u201d Hormone, 2012, January-March, 11(1):8-20). It appears that the mitochondrial membrane protein UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1, also known as thermogenin, encoded in humans by the gene UCP1), expressed in certain cells resident in brown fat, is critical in the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leading to thermogenesis by BAT (Fedorenko et al, \u201cMechanism of fatty-acid dependent UCP1 uncoupling in brown fat mitochondria\u201d Cell 2012 Oct. 12; 151(2)400-13). Furthermore, there are two distinct types of brown fat cells, commonly designated as \u201cbrown\u201d fat cells and \u201cbeige\u201d fat cells. Brown and beige fat cells are reported to have different embryological origins wherein the brown fat cells are reported to be derived from MYF5+ progenitors also capable of skeletal muscle differentiation (Seale P, Bjork B, Yang W, et al., PRDM16 controls a brown fat/skeletal muscle switch. Nature (2008); 454:961-968), and beige fat cells are reported to be derived from MYF5-progenitors (Wu et al, \u201cBeige adipocytes are a distinct type of thermogenic fat cell in mouse and human\u201d Cell, Jul. 20, 2012, 150(2)366-376).",
                        "As used in the present invention, all cells of the present invention expressing UCP1 and one or more of ADIPOQ or C19orf80 are designated as \u201cbrown\u201d fat cells. While small molecule drugs such as the thiazolidinedione class of compounds (rosiglitazone, also known as Avandia) have shown usefulness as antidiabetic agents, such compounds can often have serious side effects. Therefore, the concept of brown fat cell transplantation as a therapeutic regimen has emerged. Reports suggest that the loss of brown or beige fat cells may correlate with obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type II diabetes and restoration of these cells by transplantation can reverse obesity and type II diabetes in nonhuman animal studies. There remains, however, a need for a method for the manufacture brown fat cellular components that express UCP1 and certain adipokines expressed by brown fat tissue such as adiponectin and C19orf80 on an industrial scale suitable for transplantation in humans for the treatment of these large and growing health problems.",
                        "Techniques such as the clonal propagation of human embryonic progenitor (hEP) cell lines may facilitate the derivation of purified and scalable cell lines corresponding to regional anlagen of diverse tissue types for use in research and therapy. In addition, the standardization of research around such defined and scalable progenitors may improve the reproducibility of differentiation studies from laboratory-to-laboratory.",
                        "The present invention teaches methods and compositions for the manufacture of specific cellular components of BAT tissue, including: 1) UCP1-expressing brown adipocytes that express low to undetectable levels of the adipokines adiponectin and betatrophin; 2) adiponectin+, betatrophin+ adipocytes that express low or no levels of UCP1; 3) UCP1-expressing brown adipocytes that express ADIPOQ and C19orf80 at levels comparable to fBAT cells, and 4) vascular endothelial cells expressing ITLN1 or ITLN2; and combinations of these three cell types with collagen and hyaluronic acid-based hydrogels with or without added cells from autologous adipose-derived SVF."

The zona pellucida is removed from developed blastocysts by brief exposure to pronase (Sigma). The inner cell masses are isolated by immunosurgery, in which blastocysts are exposed to a 1:50 dilution of rabbit anti-human spleen cell antiserum for 30 min, then washed for 5 minutes three times in DMEM, and exposed to a 1:5 dilution of Guinea pig complement (Gibco) for 3 minutes (Solter et al., Proc.

                                "Human pluripotent stem cells such as iPS cells or hES cells can be propagated continuously in culture, using culture conditions that promote proliferation without promoting differentiation. Exemplary serum-containing ES medium is made with 80% DMEM (such as Knockout DMEM, Gibco), 20% of either defined fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) or serum replacement (WO 98/30679), 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mM L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Just before use, human bFGF is added to 4 ng/mL (WO 99/20741, Geron Corp.).",
                                "Traditionally, ES cells are cultured on a layer of feeder cells, typically fibroblasts derived from embryonic or fetal tissue. Said feeder cells can be of human, avian, or murine origin. In the case of murine, mouse embryos are harvested from a CF1 mouse at 13 days of pregnancy, transferred to 2.0 mL trypsin/EDTA, finely minced, and incubated 5.0 minutes at 37 degrees C. 10% FBS is added, debris is allowed to settle, and the cells are transferred to a tissue culture vessel with 90% DMEM, 10% FBS, and 2 mM glutamine. To prepare a feeder cell layer, cells are irradiated to inhibit proliferation but permit synthesis of factors that support ES cells (4000 rads gamma.-irradiation). Culture plates are coated with 0.5% gelatin overnight, plated with 375,000 irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts per well, and used 5 hours to 4 days after plating. The medium is replaced with fresh hES medium just before seeding the human pluripotent stem cells.",
                                "Human pluripotent stem cells can also be maintained in an undifferentiated state even without feeder cells. The environment for feeder-free cultures includes a suitable culture substrate, particularly an extracellular matrix such as Matrigel, HyStem, or laminin. The pluripotent stem cells are plated at >15,000 cells/cm2 (optimally 90,000 cells/cm2 to 170,000 cells/cm2). Typically, enzymatic digestion is halted before cells become completely dispersed (approximately 5 mM with collagenase IV). Clumps of about 10 to 2,000 cells are then plated directly onto the substrate without further dispersal. Alternatively, the cells can be harvested without enzymes before the plate reaches confluence by incubating the culture vessel about 5 min in a solution of 0.5 mM EDTA in PBS or mechanically aspirating colonies containing relatively undifferentiated cells with a small cytoplasmic to nuclear area ratio. After washing from the culture vessel, the cells are plated into a new culture without further dispersal. Feeder-free cultures are supported by a nutrient medium containing factors that support proliferation of the cells without differentiation. Such factors may be introduced into the medium by conditioning the medium with cells secreting such factors, such as irradiated (about 4,000 rad) primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, telomerized mouse fibroblasts, or fibroblast-like cells derived from pluripotent stem cells cells. Medium can be conditioned by plating the feeders at a density of about 5-6\u00d7104 cells/cm2 in a serum free medium such as KO DMEM supplemented with 20% serum replacement and 4.0 ng/mL bFGF. Medium that has been conditioned for 1-2 days is supplemented with further bFGF, and used to support pluripotent stem cell culture for 1-2 days. Alternatively or in addition, other factors can be added that help support proliferation without differentiation, such as ligands for the FGF-2 or FGF-4 receptor, ligands for c-kit (such as stem cell factor), ligands for receptors associated with gp130, insulin, transferrin, lipids, cholesterol, nucleosides, pyruvate, and a reducing agent such as beta-mercaptoethanol. Features of the feeder-free culture method are further discussed in International Patent Publication WO 01/51616; and Xu et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 19:971, 2001.",
                                "Relatively undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells are desired and under the microscope they appear with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios, prominent nucleoli, and compact colony formation with poorly discernable cell junctions. Primate ES cells express stage-specific embryonic antigens (SSEA) 3 and 4, and markers detectable using antibodies designated Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81 (Thomson et al., Science 282:1145, 1998). Mouse ES cells can be used as a positive control for SSEA-1, and as a negative control for SSEA-4, Tra-1-60, and Tra-1-81. SSEA-4 is consistently present on human embryonal carcinoma (hEC) cells. Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro results in the loss of SSEA-4, Tra-1-60, and Tra-1-81 expression, and increased expression of SSEA-1, which is also found on undifferentiated hEG cells.",

The culture medium for said expansion was PromoCell Smooth Muscle Cell Medium 2 (Cat. No. 97064) or alternatively (MCDB131 medium) and growth supplement (Cat. No. 39267) obtained from PromoCell GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany). The supplement levels in the expansion medium are: 5% fetal calf serum, 0.5 ng/ml EGF, 2.0 ng/ml basic FGF, and 5.0 \u03bcg/ml insulin. The cells were then expanded in standard cell culture vessels coated with gelatin, and induced into quiescence by changing the media from the above-described expansion medium, to the same medium with 10% of the normal growth supplements provided by the supplier for five days. Therefore, the quiescence medium was PromoCell Smooth Muscle Cell Medium 2 (Cat. No. 97064) or alternatively (MCDB131 medium) and growth supplement (Cat.

The line NP110SM in the relatively undifferentiated progenitor state expressed abundant transcript for Netrin G1, also known as Axon Guidance Molecule. Netrin G1 (NTNG1) belongs to a conserved family of proteins that act as axon guidance cues during vertebrate nervous system development (Nakashiba et al., 2000 (PubMed 10964959). NP110SM expressed the transcript for the molecule at levels much higher than cultured fBAT cells demonstrating the value of clonal embryonic stem cell lines as a means of not only generating potent BAT cells that simultaneously express levels of UCP1, LIPASIN, and ADIPOQ transcript comparable to fBAT cells, but also express levels of transcript for NTNG1 that is higher than fBAT cells, and unlike fBAT cells, the line NP110SM does not express COX7A1 when cultured as progenitors or differentiated up to 21 days in vitro, a marker of cells differentiated at least to fetal or adult stages of development, thereby showing that NP110SM cells have novel properties useful for BAT cell research and cell-based therapy for diseases associated with a loss of BAT cells such as adiposity, hypertension, Type I and Type II diabetes, lipodystrophies, and coronary disease.",

The differentiated cells expressing osteogenic markers, as well as markers of hard bone such as are present in the enamel of teeth, provide a model of osteogenesis as well a scalable source of novel cells useful in the repair of bone. The cells may find use in treating conditions of osteonecrosis, fractures, repair of bone following surgical resection of tumors, osteoporosis, and spinal vertebrae fusion. The cells expressing the markers of adipocyte differentiation from the interscapular region of the back, provide a model of adipogenesis, in particular of C19orf80-secreting adipocytes, as well for the scalable production of brown fat cells and cells capable of secreting C19orf80 useful in the regulation of lipids and beta cell proliferation, the latter being useful in the treatment of both type I and II diabetes. Specific differentiation conditions may be used to obtain cells expressing adipocyte markers as opposed to cells expressing osteogenic markers.",

Alameda, Calif.) wherein the matrix is thiol-modified gelatin and thiolated hyaluronan crosslinked in vivo or in vitro with (polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), or in alternative matrices or in solution without said matrices for research and therapeutic applications. For example for transplantation of cells for the treatment of lipid disorders, such as for the treatment of hyperlipidemia or for the induction of beta cell proliferation as a therapeutic modality for type I or type II diabetes, the cells may be formulated in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc.

                                "In various embodiments of the present invention, several methodologies for reducing immunogenicity of the parental and progeny cell lines in order to reduce allogenic rejection could be used prior or after cell differentiation. Ideally, shielding the donor line from any immune rejection could give rise to a universal donor parental cell lines, reducing or eliminating the need for toxic immune rejection prevention drugs in the recipient.",
                                "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules are cell surface proteins present in most cells. They are highly polymorphic and used to present antigens to the immune system to fight disease and eliminate foreign bodies. Class I HLA are heterodimers composed of two main subunits, the macroglobulin (B2M) which is essential for cell surface expression, and the HLA class I heavy chain subunit HLA-A, B, C, E, F, or G. Class I HLA-A, B and C are the major histocompatibility determinants and need to be matched between donors. Class I HLA molecules are important determinants presenting foreign peptides to activate cytotoxic T cells to destroy foreign cells. HLA class II proteins (HLA-DP, DQ and DR) are used by antigen-presenting cells and stimulate the production of antibodies by B Cells to eliminate foreign antigens.",
                                "Several methodologies can be used to minimize or eliminate the modulation of the recipient's immune system in response to donor cells. The first one consists in matching donor HLA types with the recipient HLA-type. In one embodiment of the present invention, a series of parental cell lines consisting in a library of pure selected HLA-types representing all or a subset of all possible HLA variants could be used. This would require the generation of a large library of clonally derived cells with representing various HLA types, each clonal line matching a group of recipients with corresponding HLA type.",
                                "An alternative approach consists in the removal of HLA alleles, which are responsible for the presentation foreign body antigens to the immune system. Individual HLA alleles could be knocked out individually, or by knocking out the Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) which is common to all HLA class I and necessary for cell surface expression (Riolobos, L., et al. HLA engineering of human pluripotent stem cells. Mol Ther 21, 1232-1241 (2013). HLA class II molecules can be suppressed by knocking out the essential transcription factor gene RFXANK necessary for their expression (DeSandro, A. M., Nagarajan, U. M. and Boss, J. M. Associations and interactions between bare lymphocyte syndrome factors. Mol Cell Biol 20, 6587-6599 (2000). To avoid the potential destruction of class I-negative cells by Natural Killer (NK) cells, donor cells can be engineered to expressed a non-polymorphic HLA molecule (HLA-E) which has been demonstrated to inhibit NK cell activation (Lee, N., et al. HLA-E is a major ligand for the natural killer inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA 95, 5199-5204 (1998).",
                                "Several techniques well-known in the art can be used for knocking out/editing various HLA allele and would be evident for people skilled in the art. They may include various DNA vectors, naked or encapsulated in a carrier virus or liposomes used to specifically replace or edit various genes by homologous recombination. Alternatively, other expression knock out approaches such as siRNA, anti-sense oligonucleotides could be used alone or in combination with other knock out approaches.",
                                "Another methodology, which could be employed to reduce immunogenicity of donor cells consists in engineering the cells to overexpressed HLA-G. HLA-G is expressed by placental cells during pregnancy and confers immusuppressive properties. HLA-G-modified cells and methods are described in the PCT/US2013/05757 patent application.",
                                "Other immune modulation strategies could also be employed in various embodiments of the present invention in order to maximize long-term engraftment of the donor cells in an allogenic recipient. Methodologies that aim at repressing the T-cell activation have been used successfully by Rong et al (An effective approach to prevent immune rejection of human ESC-derived allografts. Cell Stem Cell 14, 121-132 (2008)) to reduce rejection in a mouse model of human allogenic transplantation. Their approach consists in over expressing the Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) and the Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), which are known to inhibit T-Cell activation.",
                                "In certain embodiments of the present invention when long term engraftment is important to provide a long term clinical benefit, donor cells which could evade or repress immune rejection would be a distinct advantage. Moreover, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a universal parental pluripotent stem cell line, such as a human iPS cell or ES cell line engineered by the methods described herein alleviate the need to develop multiple progeny lines matching various genetic background of different recipient, or the recourse to toxic immune suppression drugs.",

In some embodiments the progenitor cells are capable of differentiation into cells that express one or more markers expressed by various brown fat cells. Exemplary markers expressed by any particular brown fat cell types of the present invention include one or more of the following: FABP4, C19orf80, ADIPOQ, UCP1, PCK1, NNAT, THRSP, CEBPA, CIDEA. In fully mature cells following transplantation into humans corresponding to in vivo-derived brown fat cells from adult or fetal-sources, COX7A1 is expressed. However, COX7A1 is not expressed in the progenitor cells of the present invention or in the brown fat cellular components derived from said progenitors in vitro prior to transplantation in vivo, reflecting that the brown fat cells of the present invention are in a primitive state of differentiation corresponding to the embryonic as opposed to fetal or adult stages of differentiation and have not previously been described in the art.",
                                "In some embodiments the invention provides an isolated cell line expressing C19orf80. In some embodiments the invention provides an isolated progenitor cell line expressing UCP1. In some embodiments the invention provides a combined formulation of cells expressing C19orf80 and UCP1.",
                                "The isolated progenitor cell line, e.g. the isolated progenitor cell line that gives rise to brown fat cells may be the in vitro differentiated progeny of a pluripotent stem cell. The brown fat cells can be obtained by differentiating the isolated progenitor cell line under suitable culture conditions described infra. Accordingly, brown fat cells of the invention may have essentially the same genome as the parental cell from which it was derived. The parental cell may be the progenitor cell line described infra, or a pluripotent precursor the progenitor cell described infra. Examples of pluripotent precursors of the progenitor cells described infra include ES cells such as hES cells, iPS such as human iPS cells and the like. Thus in some embodiments the brown fat cells of the invention may have a genome that is about 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identical to its pluripotent parental cell or cell line. In some embodiments of the invention the brown fat cells of the invention will have a genome that is greater than 90%, greater than 93%, greater than 94%, greater than 95%, greater than 96%, greater than 97%, greater than 98%, greater than 99% identical to its pluripotent parental cell or cell line."

                                "Unlike the human species, some invertebrate and vertebrate species show a profound capacity to regenerate any tissue damage that does not directly kill the organism. The most commonly-studied vertebrate organisms used in these studies are the Axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum). While many tissues may be used in regeneration research in Axolotls, the most common studies involve the amputation of the limb and study of the formation of a blastema that recapitulates development in regenerating the entire functional limb. It is commonly believed that the blastema, being composed of relatively undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in a differentiated state functionally equivalent to primitive embryonic limb bud mesenchyme (ELBM) cells, is the source of these repair processes. These ELBM cells carry a pattern of site-specific homeobox gene such as HOX gene expression that facilitate the cells then forming exactly the tissues that were removed. Methods to understand this process in the human species and to apply these insights into novel methods of tissue regeneration would have widespread clinical applications to not only the tissue engineering but even regeneration in situ for applications including but not limited to limbs lost from ischemic disease, amputation, trauma, or birth defects. In the certain embodiments of the instant invention present application, we describe clonally-purified, stable, and scalable human embryonic progenitor mesenchyme cell lines isolated from hES cells, expressing lateral plate mesoderm embryonic limb progenitor markers such as HOXA10 as well as markers that discriminate between forelimb and hindlimb such as the absence of the hindlimb marker PITX1 in forelimb progenitors, that are multipotent and capable of responding to exogenously-administered extracellular factors and conditions by differentiating into the site-specific subcutaneous fat cells known as brown adipose tissue (BAT) cells. ELBM cell lines are distinct from adult or fetal-derived tissues incapable of responding to these morphogenetic signals in generating the diverse derivatives of the developing limbs. Examples of adult-derived stem cells incapable of displaying a complete regenerative phenotype are bone marrow-derived MSCs, skin-derived MSCs, adipose-derived MSCs or adipocyte stromal fraction cells, placenta and endometrium-derived MSCs, and umbilical cord-derived MSCs. Instead, the cell lines of the present invention are purified clonal, oligoclonal, pooled clonal or pooled oligoclonal lines of embryonic progenitor cells displaying a prenatal pattern of gene expression expressed in the embryonic phases of normal human development (i.e. 2-8 weeks post fertilization), such as dermal progenitors with a prenatal pattern of gene expression, displaying a capacity of scarless wound repair. Methods and uses of said cells with a prenatal pattern of gene expression including HOXA10 expression limb bud mesenchyme are described in the following: U.S. Patent Publication 20080070303, entitled \u201cMethods to accelerate the isolation of novel cell strains from pluripotent stem cells and cells obtained thereby\u201d; U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 20080070303 and PCT Application PCT/US2006/013519, filed on Apr. 11, 2006, entitled \u201cNOVEL USES OF CELLS WITH PRENATAL PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION\u201d). Since regeneration of site-specific tissues such as the unique and relatively rare BAT cells associated with the interscapular regions of the upper dorsal aspect of the back of mammals, methods to manufacture large numbers of homogeneous cells in the embryonic progenitor state and with site-specific homeobox gene expression would be useful.",
                                "By way of non-limiting example, homogeneous populations of upper limb bud mesenchyme that still retains a prenatal pattern of gene expression, such as hES-derived monoclonal embryonic progenitor cell lines expressing the limb mesenchyme marker HOXA10 but lacking the expression of the lower limb marker PITX1, could be used to generate mesenchyme capable of generating brown fat progenitors or fully-differentiated BAT cells. These cells may be formulated in isotonic solutions of disaggregated cells in a relatively undifferentiated (progenitor state), or as more differentiated cells, with or without isolated adipose stromal fraction cells to provide a diversity of autologous vascular endothelial cells, perivascular cells, and WAT cell progenitors. Alternatively, the aforementioned cells cells may be formulated in hydrogels such as HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.), wherein the matrix comprises a thiol-modified gelatin and thiolated hyaluronan crosslinked in vivo or in vitro with (polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). In other embodiments other known matrices may be used or the cells may be formulated in solution without said matrices. The cells formulated as described infra, may then be used in any of the applications described infra, including in research on stem cell biology, embryology, and tissue regeneration, or in therapy, such as to increase the number of BAT cells to reduce total body fat, increase insulin sensitivity, and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.",

To each dish, a preparation of a single cell suspension from the candidate culture propagated in the NP(+) medium was then manually diluted by adding to the 15 cm culture dishes that volume of cells determined by counting a suspension of cells such that there were a selection of the following dilutions of cells; 500 cells/dish or, 1000 cells/dish or; 1500 cells/dish or; 3000 cells/dish, 5000 cells/dish or 7000 cells/dish to achieve different densities of the single cell suspension and to aid in the isolation of single colonies grown from a single cell. Alternatively, cells can be dispersed as single cells using a automatic cell deposition unit, or said automatic deposition can be used following flow sorting or other affinity purification techniques known in the art such as antibody-based selection, including monoclonal antibody-based immunoselection using flow cytometry or antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads to select cells to select cells enriched for antigens present on NP110SM cells. Such antigens may include Interleukin 13 Receptor, Alpha 2 (IL13RA2), also known as CD213A2, also known as Cancer/Testis Antigen 19.",
                                "In the case of manual dilution of cells, three separate dishes with any three of the above mentioned densities were optimised such that discrete, easily isolatable single colonies could be observed for isolation and expansion as embryonic progenitor cell lines. Seeded single cells of an appropriate dilution were distributed evenly in the dish by the sliding the 15 cm dish alternately in a clockwise, followed by counterclockwise, then side to side (left to right) motion, followed by a forward and back motion repeatedly, for about 30 seconds inside the incubator. Dishes were then incubated in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 20% O2) and left undisturbed without moving or feeding for 14 days to allow single cells to attach to the culture dish surface and for colonies to grow to sufficient size for isolation. NP(+) media previously conditioned by the NP110SM cells for 24-48 hours can be used to increase the number and rate of proliferation of the resulting colonies.",
                                "Dishes were visually inspected and well-separated cell colonies were picked with sterile cloning cylinders (Sigma, Cat #CLS31666, CLS31668 & CLS316610) using 25 ul TrypLE for a 6 mm cylinder, 50 ul TrypLE for an 8 mm cylinder and 100 ul TrypLE for a 10 mm cylinder. Each isolated cell colony was then plated into one well each of 0.1% Gelatin-coated 24 well plates (Nunc, 142475) containing 1 ml of Promocell Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium 2 or its equivalent medium (designated SM medium herein). In this instance of the method, isolated embryonic progenitor cells are further cultured in the SM media. Upon confluence, cells in the 24-well plate were dissociated using TrypLE for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. and replated in progressively larger tissue culture vessels being: one well of a 6-well plate, T25 flask, T75 flask and T225 flask(s) in the SM medium over several weeks (an average of 1-2 weeks between each passage). Confluent cells in the T225 flask(s) were cryopreserved and banked as an isolated Embryonic Progenitor Cell Lines and seeded for immunostaining and RNA isolation, such as for PCR amplification of the transcripts for HOXA5 and IL13RA2 as a first pass screen for cells with a pattern of gene expression like that of the clonal cell line NP110SM.",

Said cells may then be exposed to differentiation conditions as described herein. By way of nonlimiting example, hES cell-derived clonal embryonic progenitor cell lines can be cultured in HyStem Bead Differentiation Condition as described herein wherein the Differentiation medium is supplemented with BMP4 at a concentration of 10 ng/mL-50 ng/mL for 14-21 days. Preferably the conditions and time of differentiation are constant with the diverse clonal embryonic progenitor cells. Differentiated cells can then be assayed for markers of differentiation by methods known in the art including gene expression reporter constructs, immunocytochemistry, and by the isolation of RNA and analysis of the mRNA transcripts in said samples by PCR or gene expression microarray. Samples that express FABP4 (accession number NM_001442.1, Illumina ID 150373) and CD36 (accession number NM_000072.2, Illumina ID 3310538) are considered to be differentiation into adipocytic lineages. Said cell cultures that express adipocyte markers such as FABP4 and simultaneously express the gene BETATROPHIN (accession number NM_018687.3, Illumina ID 1430689) (also known as C19ORF80, LOC55908, and C19Orf80) can be considered as hits and are therefore candidates for progenitors of brown adipose tissue cells.",

Alameda, Calif.) is a matrix composed of thiol-modified gelatin and thiolated hyaluronan crosslinked in vivo or in vitro with (polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). We observed that clonal human embryonic progenitor cell lines such as those described in the present invention, could be frozen and thawed within beads of polymerized HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc.

This facilitates the accumulation of large numbers of beads with large numbers of diverse hEP cell types that can be simultaneously thawed and assayed such as in high throughput robotic systems wherein the beads are exposed to diverse differentiation conditions and their differentiation assayed by gene expression microarray or other means known in the art. It also makes possible the thawing of large numbers of cryopreserved beads and the incubation of combinations of beads with diverse types of embedded cells and subsequent analysis of changes of differentiated state such as gene expression microarray or other means known in the art.",
                                "In addition, the incubation of hEP cell lines in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) allowed the accumulation of a large amount of data on the biological influence of HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) on diverse cell types. With Illumina gene expression microarray data from more than 3,000 differentiation experiments, we searched for genes frequently up- and down-regulated in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) beads and compared those profiles to those obtained under micromass conditions. For example, we observed that cells cultured in HyStem-4D (Biotime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) beads with BMP4 frequently exhibited a marked decrease in myofibroblast markers such as MYH11, and increased expression of adipocyte markers such as FABP4 and anti-inflammatory markers such as TIMP4. The cell line E15, which in other conditions was shown to have chondrogenic potential and the line W10 strongly induced MYH11 in micromass conditions supplemented with 10 ng/mL BMP4, but this induction was essentially ablated in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) culture supplemented with BMP4. Instead, in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) beads, the line markedly upregulated expression of DCN, a marker of meninges. This physiological effect on myofibroblastic differentiation seen in many lines cultured in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) beads (i.e., the strong reduction in MYH11 expression) has therapeutic implications in vivo, such as in inhibiting fibrosis or adhesions. It also is of benefit in surgical settings where cells could be transplanted to regenerate tissue function while inhibiting adhesions and related fibrotic process at the surgical site.",

No. 14/048,910, incorporated by reference) diverse clonal embryonic progenitor cell lines show correspondingly diverse differentiation responses to growth factors such as members of the TGF-beta superfamily. In some cases, including but not limited to the culture of the cells in HyStem-C (BioTime, Inc. Alameda, Calif.) beads in the presence of BMP4, some cell lines strongly express markers of adipocytes such as FABP4 and CD36. Because the clonal progenitor cell lines capable of adipocyte differentiation represent mesenchymal anlagen of diverse anatomical origin, the corresponding adipocytes may represent fat-forming cells with diverse phenotypes. Some of these diverse phenotypes offer novel therapeutic opportunities as described herein.",

Similarly, the lines E72, E75, E163, as well as clonal hES-derived embryonic progenitors corresponding to other anatomic locations, also differentiated into FABP4-expressing cells. However, only MSCs, E72, E75, and E163 cells induced C19orf80/betatrophin expression upon differentiation.

For example, libraries of gene trap single cell-derived or oligoclonal cell-derived cells and/or their differentiated progeny may be made by methods of this invention, and assayed to detect changes in the level of expression of the gene trap markers as the cells differentiate in vitro and in vivo. The methods for making gene trap cells and for detecting changes in the expression of the gene trap markers as the cells differentiate are reviewed in Durick et al. (Genome Res. (1999) 9:1019-25). The vectors and methods useful for making gene trap cells and for detecting changes in the expression of the gene trap markers as the cells differentiate are also described in U.S. Pat.

Methods for genetically modifying cells, inducing their differentiation in vitro, and using them to generate chimeric or nuclear-transfer cloned embryos and cloned mice are developed and known in the art. To facilitate the identification of genes and the characterization of their physiological activities, large libraries of gene trap cells having gene trap DNA markers randomly inserted in their genomes may be prepared. Efficient methods have been developed to screen and detect changes in the level of expression of the gene trap markers as the cells differentiate in vitro or in vivo. In vivo methods for inducing single cell-derived or oligoclonal cell-derived cells or their differentiated progeny to differentiate further include injecting one or more cells into a blastocyst to form a chimeric embryo that is allowed to develop; fusing a stem cell with an enucleated oocyte to form a nuclear transfer unit (NTU), and culturing the NTU under conditions that result in generation of an embryo that is allowed to develop; and implanting one or more clonogenic differentiated cells into an immune-compromised or a histocompatible host animal (e.g., a SCID mouse, or a syngeneic nuclear donor) and allowing teratomas comprising differentiated cells to form. In vitro methods for inducing single cell-derived or oligoclonal cell-derived cells to differentiate further include culturing the cells in a monolayer, in suspension, or in three-dimensional matrices, alone or in co-culture with cells of a different type, and exposing them to one of many combinations of chemical, biological, and physical agents, including co-culture with one or more different types of cells, that are known to capable of induce or allow differentiation.",

For example, factors that override cell cycle arrest may be joined to a protein transduction domain (PTD). Protein transduction domains, covalently or non-covalently linked to factors that override cell cycle arrest, allow the translocation of said factors across the cell membranes so the protein may ultimately reach the nuclear compartments of the cells. PTDs that may be fused with factors that override cell cycle arrest include the PTD of the HIV transactivating protein (TAT) (Tat 47-57) (Schwarze and Dowdy 2000 Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 21: 45-48; Krosl et al. 2003 Nature Medicine (9): 1428-1432). For the HIV TAT protein, the amino acid sequence conferring membrane translocation activity corresponds to residues 47-57 (Ho et al., 2001, Cancer Research 61: 473-477; Vives et al., 1997, J. Biol.

The hEP cells and their differentiated progeny can be used in drug screening. For example the cell, such as a differentiated progeny of hEP cell could be contacted with a test drug or compound and analyzed for toxicity by examining the cells under a microscope and observing their morphology or by studying their growth or survival in culture. The cells may also be screened for gene expression to determine the effects of the drug, in particular, for inducing the browning of fat by assaying for UCP1, ADIPOQ, or C19ORF80 expression. For example, a comparison could be made between a differentiated progeny of hEP cell that has been contacted with the test drug or compound compared with the same differentiated progeny cell that has not been so contacted.",

Induction may be carried out in a variety of methods that juxtapose the inducer cell with the target cell. By way of nonlimiting examples, the inducer cells may be plated in tissue culture and treated with mitomycin C or radiation to prevent the cells from replicating further. The target cells are then plated on top of the mitotically-inactivated inducer cells. Alternatively, the differentiated progeny of hEP cells may be cultured on a removable membrane from a larger culture of cells or from an original single cell-derived colony and the target cells may be plated on top of the inducer cells or a separate membrane covered with target cells may be juxtaposed so as to sandwich the two cell layers in direct contact. The resulting bilayer of cells may be cultured in vitro, transplanted into a SPF avian egg, or cultured in conditions to allow growth in three dimensions while being provided vascular support (see, for example, international patent publication number WO/2005/068610, published Jul. 28, 2005, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference).

                                "In another embodiment of the invention, the single cell-derived and oligoclonal cell-derived cells generated according to the methods of the present invention are useful for harvesting mRNA, microRNA, and cDNA from either single cells or a small number of cells (i.e., clones) to generate a database of gene expression information. This database allows researchers to identify the identity of cell types by searching for which cell types in the database express or do not express genes at comparable levels of the cell type or cell types under investigation. For example, the relative expression of mRNA may be determined using microarray analysis as is well known in the art. The relative values may be imported into a software such as Microsoft Excel and gene expression values from the different cell lines normalized using various techniques well known in the art such as mean, mode, median, and quantile normalization. Hierarchical clustering with the single linkage method may be performed with the software such as The R Project for Statistical Computing as is well known in the art. An example of such documentation may be found online. A hierarchical clustering analysis can then be performed as is well known in the art. These software programs perform a hierarchical cluster analysis using a group of dissimilarities for the number of objects being clustered. At first, each object is put in its own cluster, then iteratively, each similar cluster is joined until there is one cluster. Distances between clusters are computed by Lance-Williams dissimilarity update formula (Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) The New S Language. Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole. (S version.); Everitt, B. (1974). Cluster Analysis. London: Heinemann Educ. Books). Typically the vertical axis of the dendograms displays the extent of similarity of the gene expression profiles of the cell clones. That is, the farther down they branch apart, the more similar they are. The verticle axis is a set of n\u22121 non-decreasing real values. The clustering height is the value of the criterion associated with the clustering method for the particular agglomeration. In order to determine if a new cell line is identical to existing cell lines, two types of replicates are performed: biological and technical replicates. Biological replicates require that new cell lines be grown, mRNA harvested, and then the analysis compared. Technical replicates, on the other hand, analyze the same RNA twice. A line cutoff is then drawn just above where the replicates branch such that cells branching below the cutoff line are considered the same cell type. Another source of data for the database described above may be microRNA profiles of the single cell-derived and oligoclonal cell-derived cells or their differentiated progeny described infra. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous RNAs of \u221222 nucleotides that play important regulatory roles in animals & plants by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. More than 700 miRNAs have been identified across species. Their expression levels vary among species and tissues. Low abundant miRNAs have been difficult to detect based on current technologies such as cloning, Northern hybridization, and the modified Invader\u00ae assay. In the present invention, an alternative approach using a new real-time quantitation method termed looped-primer RT-PCR was used for accurate and sensitive detection of miRNAs as well as other non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules present in human embryonic stem cells and in cell lines differentiated from human embryonic stem cells.",
                                "In another embodiment of the invention, gene expression analysis may be used to identify the developmental pathways and cell types for in vitro differentiated hES cells. Gene expression analysis of single cells or a small number of cells from human or nonhuman embryonic or fetal tissues provides another means to generate a database of unique gene expression profiles for distinct populations of cells at different stages of differentiation. Gene expression analysis on single cells isolated from specific tissues may be performed as previously described by Kurimoto et al., Nucleic Acids Research (2006) Vol. 34, No. 5, e42. Thus, cellular miRNA profiles on their own or in conjunction with gene expression profiles, immunocytochemistry, and proteomics provide molecular signatures that can be used to identify the tissue and developmental stage of differentiating cell lines. This technique illustrates that the database may be used to accurately identify cell types and distinguish them from other cell types.",

This subset of \u201call-or none\u201d markers can be easily identified by comparing the levels of expression as measured for instance through the use of oligonucleotide probes or other means know in the art, and comparing the level of a gene's expression in one line compared to all the other lines of the present invention. Those genes that are expressed at relatively high levels in a subset of lines, and not at all in other lines, are used to generate a short list of gene expression markers. When applied to the cells and gene expression data described herein, where negative expression in Illumina 1 is <120 RFU and positive expression is >140 RFU.",

In brief, candidate cultures expanded in NP(+) medium as described supra, were plated at clonal densities as described herein. The embryonic progenitor cell lines of the present invention designated ESI EP004NP90SM, ESI-EP004NP91SM, ESI-EP004NP92SM, EP004NP93SM, ESI-EPO4NP110SM (also known as NP110SM herein) and ESI-EP004NP111SM, and ESI-EPOO4NP1135M were isolated colonies that formed in NP(+) medium which were subsequently harvested and plated in SM medium as described supra. These novel cell lines of the present invention at passage 11, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, and 11 respectively were grown in 0.1% Gelatin-coated 6 well plates in the respective media. Upon confluence, media was replaced with 10% low supplement media (for each media type, dilute complete medium 1:10 with basal (no supplement) medium. The cells were allowed to become quiescent in low serum media for five days with one change of medium after three days. Cells were lysed with 350 ul/well of Qiagen RLT buffer and lysate transferred to 1.5 ml RNAes free Eppendorf tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until ready to send for gene expression analysis using Illumina gene expression bead arrays as described herein.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 14, the cell line NP110SM expressed both HOXA5 showed 1553 RFUs of expression and IL13RA2 showed 988 RFUs of expression while the other clones showed no or very low expression (120 RFUs and below being considered no expression). The line NP110SM was then exposed to differentiation in the BAT cell differentiation protocols described herein. Briefly, fBAT preadipocyte cells at passage 4-5 (Zenbio, Item Code CA-10, lot number 8314-102113) and NP110SM cells at passage 10 were cultured as described above in this example to induce quiescence for five days and RNA was isolated as described herein for microarray analysis. Then the fBAT and NP110SM cells were differentiated for 14 days in conditions described herein to induce differentiation of the cells into BAT cells expressing UCP1, C19ORF80, and ADIPOQ. As shown in FIG. 15, control fBAT cells and control NP110SM cells (labeled \u201cCtrl\u201d and samples 1 and 5 respectively) showed low or undetectable levels of UCP1, C19ORF80, and ADIPOQ (RFU values of <120 being considered nonspecific background hybridization). Both fBAT cells and NP110SM cells induced expression of adipocyte markers such as FABP4 (accession number NM_001442.1, Illumina Probe ID 150373), and CD36 (accession number NM_000072.2, Illumina Probe ID 3310538) in all the differentiation conditions shown in FIG. 15 (data not shown). When differentiated for 14 days in HyStem beads supplemented in 50 ng/ml BMP4, both fBAT and NP110SM cells (FIG. 15 samples 2 and 6 respectively) responded by markedly up-regulating C19ORF80, and ADIPOQ expression, while UCP1 was expressed at a low or undetectable level in both cell types. In samples differentiated in HyStem beads for 14 days supplemented with 5.0 \u03bcM rosiglitazone, both fBAT and NP110SM cells (FIG. 15 lanes 3 and 7 respectively) markedly up-regulated UCP1, C19ORF80, and ADIPOQ at comparable levels. The combination of 50 ng/ml BMP4 and 5.0 \u03bcM rosiglitazone did not appear to further increase the expression of UCP1, C19ORF80, or ADIPOQ in fBAT or NP110SM cells (FIG. 15 lanes 4 and 8 respectively) although the addition of BMP4 appeared to improve the viability of differentiating NP110SM cells as evidenced by increased RNA yields. The addition of 10 M CL316243 together with 50 ng/ml BMP4 and 5.0 \u03bcM rosiglitazone appeared to further increase the expression of UCP1 in the NP110SM cells (FIG. 15, lane 9).",
                                "It is critical for BAT cells intended to be functionally engrafted in vivo is that the cells will recruit innervation by the sympathetic nervous system. As shown in FIG. 15, panel D, the line NP110SM expressed abundant transcript for Netrin G1, also known as Axon Guidance Molecule. Netrin G1 (NTNG1) belongs to a conserved family of proteins that act as axon guidance cues during vertebrate nervous system development (Nakashiba et al., 2000 (PubMed 10964959). NP110SM expressed the transcript for the molecule at levels much higher than cultured fBAT cells demonstrating the value of clonal embryonic stem cell lines as a means of not only generating potent BAT cells that simultaneously express levels of UCP1, C19ORF80, and ADIPOQ transcript comparable to fBAT cells, but also express levels of transcript for NTNG1 that is higher than fBAT cells, and unlike fBAT cells, the line NP110SM does not express COX7A1 when cultured as progenitors or differentiated up to 21 days in vitro, a marker of cells differentiated at least to fetal or adult stages of development, thereby showing that NP110SM cells have novel properties useful for BAT cell research and cell-based therapy for diseases associated with a loss of BAT cells such as adiposity, hypertension, Type I and Type II diabetes, lipodystrophies, and coronary disease."
