                        "Meat flavor is a key factor influencing consumer choice. During meat processing, Maillard reaction and lipid degradation occur, resulting in a large number of volatile compounds that impart aroma to meat. Among them, the Maillard reaction usually produces sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds. Lipid degradation usually produces aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, esters, and the like, resulting in animal-specific meat flavors. Obviously, volatile flavor compounds in meat are rich and complex in structure, and there are certain technical difficulties in identification. The identification of volatile flavor compounds is not only related to the content thereof, but also closely related to extraction and analysis methods thereof. Usually, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry is used to identify volatile flavor compounds. Both methods require sample pretreatment, involve heating, distillation, extraction and other processes. Operations are cumbersome. The sample volume is substantially consumed, and it is easy to cause organic solvent residues. The sample pretreatment process may destroy some of the original characteristic aroma components of the meat; in addition, the pretreatment or detection time is too long, which may also lead to untimely and inaccurate determination results. Therefore, how to realize the freedom of the sample pretreatment, stable results, fast response, and high sensitivity in the detection process of volatile flavor compounds in meat is an urgent problem to be solved at present."
