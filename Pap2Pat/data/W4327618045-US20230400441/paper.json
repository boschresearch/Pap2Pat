    "abstract": "The distinctive flavor compounds of donkey meat are unknown. Accordingly, in the present study, the volatile compounds (VOCs) in the meat from SanFen (SF) and WuTou (WT) donkeys were comprehensively analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) combined with multivariate analysis. A total of 38 VOCs, of which 33.33% were ketones, 28.89% were alcohols, 20.00% were aldehydes, and 2.22% were heterocycles, were identified. Ketones and alcohols were significantly more abundant for SF than for WT, whereas aldehydes showed the opposite trend. The donkey meats from the two strains were well differentiated using topographic plots, VOC fingerprinting, and multivariate analysis. A total of 17 different VOCs were identified as potential markers for distinguishing the different strains, including hexanal-m, 3-octenal, oct-1-en-3-ol, and pentanal-d. These results indicate that GC\u2013IMS combined with multivariate analysis is a convenient and powerful method for characterizing and discriminating donkey meat.",

                "Donkey husbandry is an important industry in China and has become instrumental in optimizing animal farming practices, enriching the number and types of animal products available to the consumer, meeting diversified consumption demands, increasing farmers\u2019 incomes, and implementing rural revitalization (1). Donkey meat has gained increasing popularity because of its nutritional value and distinctive flavor. It is a tender, low-calorie meat with high protein and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. Accordingly, it has become accepted as a high-quality meat, and it accounts for more than 80% of the economic benefits of donkey breeding and production (2\u20134).",
                "Flavor is one of the most important factors of meat quality. Meat flavor is the result of the combination of volatile compounds (VOCs), which are sensed by smell and taste (5). Meat flavor directly affects sensory characteristics, food quality, and consumers\u2019 purchase intention, and it is affected by the source, type, and processing of the meat (6, 7). More than 1,000 VOCs belonging to nine categories, including alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, and acids, have been identified in meat and meat products (8). VOCs contribute to the characteristic flavor of meats and are therefore closely related to consumer preference (9). For instance, a large number of VOCs, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids, and esters, have been detected in mutton, with 4-methyl octanoic acid and 4-ethyl octanoic acid playing major roles in mutton smell (10); while aldehydes are the main VOCs in donkey meat, as revealed by solid-phase microextraction\u2013gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (SPME\u2013GC\u2013MS), with hexanal the most abundant volatile flavor compound (3, 11). Other SPME-GC\u2013MS studies have shown that maltotriose, L-glutamate, and L-proline are the main contributors to the unique taste of donkey meat (12). GC\u2013MS or gas chromatography\u2013olfactometry\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013O\u2013MS) are commonly used to identify the VOCs in meat and meat products (13). However, these methods require complex sample pre-treatments (e.g., heating, distillation, and extraction) and long detection times, leading to untimely and inaccurate determination results (14).",
                "Gas chromatography\u2013ion mobility spectroscopy (GC\u2013IMS), which has the advantages of rapid detection, stable results, and convenient operation without sample pre-treatment, is a new method to detect the VOCs of meat and meat products (15, 16). Using GC\u2013IMS in combination with principal component analysis (PCA), beef, mutton, and chicken were distinguished with a classification accuracy of 98.3% (17). Furthermore, GC\u2013IMS and statistical methods have been used to identify significant differences in the types and contents of VOCs in bacon from different pork breeds (18). In addition, the VOCs of Jinhua ham aged for different times and dry-cured pork with different salt contents have been analyzed based on GC\u2013IMS and chemometrics analysis (19, 20). However, GC\u2013IMS of VOCs combined with multivariate analysis has not been applied to establishing a methodology for the identification and analysis of donkey meat.",
                "Accordingly, in the present study, the VOC profiles of donkey meat from SanFen (SF) and WuTou (WT) donkeys were comprehensively analyzed and compared by GC\u2013IMS combined with multivariate analysis. Ultimately, our results facilitate a better understanding of the characteristic VOCs of donkey meat and provide a novel strategy for its authentication."

            "paragraphs": [
                "In this study, the VOCs in donkey meat were identified and analyzed by GC\u2013IMS with chemometrics analysis. Accordingly, 38 VOCs belonging to four categories were identified in raw donkey meat. This is significantly lower than the number of VOCs previously identified by GC\u2013MS in cooked donkey meat and cooked horse meat (11, 21). It is well known that VOCs are more abundant in cooked meat and that they are generated by the Maillard reaction between amino compounds and reducing sugars, lipid degradation, and lipid-Maillard interactions during heating (22). The present study has shown that ketones, alcohols, and aldehydes are the most abundant VOCs in uncooked donkey meat and that aldehydes are the characteristic VOCs in WT donkey meat. This is consistent with previous GC\u2013MS results for Xiaohei donkey meat (3). The levels of ketones, alcohols, and aldehydes in SF and WT donkey meats are significantly different, with aldehydes being more abundant in WT donkey meat. Previous studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of different types of VOCs differ between breeds of pork and chicken (23, 24).",
                "The GC-IMS spectra and fingerprints visually represent the results of flavor measurement between samples, where the fingerprint can be used to intuitively and quantitatively compare the differences in VOC profiles between samples (15). In the present study, significant differences were observed in the spectra of SF and WT donkey meats. These results were confirmed by their VOC fingerprints, where ethanol and hexanal-d show very clear differences between the two strains. This indicates that differences between SF and WT donkey meat samples can be quickly identified by GC\u2013IMS analysis through their VOC profiles, which is in agreement with previous studies on pork from different pig breeds (18). Multivariate analysis, including unsupervised pattern recognition (UPR) and supervised pattern recognition (SPR), is used to analyze omics data from different experimental groups (25). UPR (PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis) is used to analyze data without grouping samples, which ignores random errors in the group (26). SPR includes PLS-DA and OPLS-DA analysis, which eliminates the deficiency of UPR, i.e., easy overfitting (27). Permutation validation is applied in OPLS-DA analysis to determine the overfitting of a model (28). In the present study, multivariate analysis methods (PCA, PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, and heatmap analysis) were used to confirm the accuracy of the data and fingerprints obtained by GC\u2013IMS. The VOCs of donkey meats from the different strains were well differentiated using PCA, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA analysis, and OPLS-DA eliminated over-fitting in the current study. A total of 17 differential VOCs were identified between the different strains, including hexanal-m, 3-octenal, oct-1-en-3-ol, hexanal-d, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone, which is consistent with the fingerprint results. These results demonstrate that multivariate analysis can be applied to distinguishing different samples and screening biomarkers from GC\u2013IMS data.",
                "Previous studies have shown that the VOCs in meat are breed-dependent (29). This is consistent with the present study, in which the VOCs in donkey meat were also found to be strain-dependent. In this study, tetrahydrofurane, hexanal-m, pentan-1-ol-d, pentan-1-ol-m, 3-octenal, oct-1-en-3-ol, pentanal-d, (e)-hept-2-enal, pentanal-m, and hexanal-d were identified as characteristic VOCs of WT donkey meat, whereas 2-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, benzaldehyde, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and 2-pentanone-m were identified as characteristic VOCs of SF donkey meat. This is consistent with the findings reported for Xiaohei donkey meat (3). The formation of VOCs is complex and their sources are extensive, among which, lipids are the main sources of meat flavor development. Lipid degradation is the basis for the formation of unique meat flavor compounds such as aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols (30). 18:1 fatty acid is oxidized to produce octanal, nonanal, and 2-undecenal; 18:2 fatty acid is oxidized to produce hexanal, 2-nonenal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, and 2-pentylfuran; and 20:4 fatty acid is oxidized to produce heptanal, 1-octene-3-ol (31). Recent research has shown that the fatty acid compositions of SF and WT donkey meats are not significantly different, and 37 different lipid molecules were identified between them, mainly including glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids (32). Fatty acids at different positions of lipid molecules also affect the formation of VOCs. For example, fatty acids in glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 site show high thermal oxidative stability, whereas triglyceride is more readily hydrolyzed to free fatty acids and then oxidized to form VOCs (33, 34). In addition, VOCs can undergo further degradation into other VOCs, as observed in different types of meat (35)."
