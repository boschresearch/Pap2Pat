Since new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed, it has been suggested that enhancing brain or central nervous system (CNS) mitohormesis, i.e., stressing mitochondria to induce a positive adaptive response, might be a promising approach. However, no target-specific or suitable in vivo mitohormesis-activating drug has yet been identified."

Other genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease include, but are not limited to ABCA7, CLU, PLD3, TREM2, and SORL1. CLU helps regulate the clearance of amyloid-beta from the brain. It is believed that an imbalance in the production and clearance of amyloid-beta is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. A deficiency in the protein produced by CR1 may contribute to chronic inflammation in the brain. Inflammation is another possible factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. PLD3 has been linked to a significantly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. TREM2 is involved in the regulation of the brain's response to inflammation. Variants in this gene are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, variations of SORL1 have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease.",

(1999) Arch. Neurol. 56(3): 303-308). It is considered in many instances to be a boundary or transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. Although MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, when memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed \u201camnestic MCI\u201d and is frequently seen as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (see, e.g., Grundman et al. (2004) Arch. Neurol. 61(1): 59-66; and on the internet at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment-cite_note-Grundman-1). When individuals have impairments in domains other than memory it is often classified as non-amnestic single- or multiple-domain MCI and these individuals are believed to be more likely to convert to other dementias (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies). There is evidence suggesting that while amnestic MCI patients may not meet neuropathologic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, patients may be in a transitional stage of evolving Alzheimer's disease; patients in this hypothesized transitional stage demonstrated diffuse amyloid in the neocortex and frequent neurofibrillary tangles in the medial temporal lobe (see, e.g., Petersen et al. (2006) Arch. Neurol. 63(5): 665-72).",
                                "The diagnosis of MCI typically involves a comprehensive clinical assessment including clinical observation, neuroimaging, blood tests and neuropsychological testing. A similar assessment is usually given for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There is emerging evidence that magnetic resonance imaging can observe deterioration, including progressive loss of gray matter in the brain, from mild cognitive impairment to full-blown Alzheimer disease (see, e.g., Whitwell et al. (2008) Neurology 70(7): 512-520). A technique known as PiB PET imaging is used to clearly show the sites and shapes of beta amyloid deposits in living subjects using a C11 tracer that binds selectively to such deposits (see, e.g., Jack et al. (2008) Brain 131(Pt 3): 665-680).",

The CDR is a five point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment & Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home & Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant or collateral source (e.g., family member).",
                                "The CDR table provides descriptive anchors that guide the clinician in making appropriate ratings based on interview data and clinical judgment. In addition to ratings for each domain, an overall CDR score may be calculated through the use of an algorithm. This score is useful for characterizing and tracking a patient's level of impairment/dementia: 0=Normal; 0.5=Very Mild Dementia; 1=Mild Dementia; 2=Moderate Dementia; and 3=Severe Dementia. An illustrative CDR table is shown in Table 2.",

                                "In some embodiments, a diagnosis of MCI can be determined by considering the results of several clinical tests. For example, Grundman, et al., Arch Neurol (2004) 61:59-66 report that a diagnosis of MCI can be established with clinical efficiency using a simple memory test (paragraph recall) to establish an objective memory deficit, a measure of general cognition (Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)) to exclude a broader cognitive decline beyond memory, and a structured clinical interview (CDR) with patients and caregivers to verify the patient's memory complaint and memory loss and to ensure that the patient was not demented. Patients with MCI perform, on average, less than 1 standard deviation (SD) below normal on nonmemorycognitive measures included in the battery. Tests of learning, attention, perceptual speed, category fluency, and executive function may be impaired in patients with MCI, but these are far less prominent than the memory deficit.",

                                "Parkinson's disease (PD) has become the second most common neurodegenerative disease following Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is estimated to occur in about 1% of the population over the age of 60 and 4% of the individuals aged over 80 years. The major pathological changes in PD patients are the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of intraneuronal inclusions of the \u03b1-synuclein, which are called Lewy bodies. Clinically, PD mainly manifests as motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscle rigidity and postural instability. PD also appears to be correlated with nonmotor symptoms, including olfactory dysfunction, sleep problems, constipation, depression and dysautonomia, due to the neuronal loss in several other brain areas that may occur before or after dopaminergic neurons are lost.",
                                "The motor symptoms of bradykinesia, resting tremor and muscle rigidity can be considered as the most significant and direct diagnostic marker for PD. Additionally, these motor features can also be utilized to monitor response to medical treatments and evaluate disease progression in PD. For the early diagnosis of the disease, many non-motor features, including hyposmia, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, and constipation, are receiving increasing attention as they may be helpful in the detection of prodromal PD.",
                                "In various embodiments, it is believed treatment with N-PPG can amelioriate one or more of these symptoms and/or slow the progression of such symptoms.",

                                "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, causing loss of muscle control. ALS often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in a limb, or slurred speech. Eventually, ALS affects control of the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. There is no cure for this fatal disease.",
                                "In 1993 it was reported that mutations in the gene encoding SOD1 account for about 25% of cases of FALS or 2-3% of all cases. More than 100 different mutations in the SOD1 gene have now been associated with FALS. Forced expression of high levels of a mutant SOD1 transgene causes progressive motor neuron disease in mice and rats. A second ALS gene, the ALS2 has been implicated in ALS. The ALS2 gene codes for a novel protein with homology to guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for GTPases. Loss-of-function of ALS2 leads to denervation beginning in the first decade, with predominant corticobulbar and corticospinal signs and very slow progression. Additionally, it has been observed that a progressive, bulbar-predominant form of lower motor neuropathy arises from mutations in a dynactin gene, suggesting that that motor protein defects can progressively impair motor neuron function, as reported for motor neuropathies from mutations in the kinesin gene.",
                                "Signs and symptoms of ALS vary greatly from person to person, depending on which neurons are affected. Signs and symptoms might include, but are not limited to difficulty walking or doing normal daily activities, tripping and falling, weakness in your leg, feet or ankles, hand weakness or clumsiness, slurred speech or trouble swallowing, muscle cramps and twitching in your arms, shoulders and tongue, inappropriate crying, laughing or yawning, and/or cognitive and behavioral changes. ALS often starts in the hands, feet or limbs, and then spreads to other parts of your body. As the disease advances and nerve cells are destroyed, your muscles get weaker. This eventually affects chewing, swallowing, speaking and breathing.",
                                "Muscle strength is a clinically relevant measure of disease progression in ALS. There are a variety of methods of varying sophistication available to measure muscle strength. The measures most often used in natural history studies and clinical trials are maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and manual muscle testing (MMT).",
                                "MVIC has proven useful as an outcome measure in studies and clinical trials in ALS and is a valid and reliable measure of disease progression. MVIC can be measured using a hand-held dynamometer or a fixed device with strain gauges. The strength of individual muscle groups is determined quantitatively and then the scores are normalized and combined into composite scores called megascores. This allows for the averaging of strength of small and large muscle groups.",
                                "The MVIC is a good quantitative measure of the rate of decline of muscle strength, an outcome measure that is highly relevant to the disease. The advantages of MVIC include good reliability, sensitivity to small, clinically relevant changes and generation of numerically continuous data which are suitable for parametric statistical analysis.",
                                "Another useful technique for evaluating ALS progression uses hand-held dynamometry (HHD) to test isometric strength of multiple muscles, again with standard patient positioning and rigorous training.",
                                "Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in ALS and measurements of respiratory muscle function are commonly used as secondary outcome measures in ALS clinical trials. Vital capacity and maximal inspiratory and maximal expiratory mouth pressures are the methods most commonly used to evaluate respiratory muscle strength. These measures are widely available, non-invasive, and portable. The forced vital capacity (FVC) measures volume of air forcefully expired in one breath. Usually, the FVC is reported as a percentage of a predicted vital capacity based on subject's height, gender and age. The FVC declines with time in patients with ALS and is a sensitive measure of disease progression. Both the baseline FVC and the rate of decline in FVC are predictive of survival. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measures the maximal negative pressure at the mouth after complete exhalation followed by a single sustained maximal inspiratory effort against an occluded airway. Maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) is the maximal positive pressure measured at the mouth after inhalation to total lung capacity followed by a maximal expiratory effort against an occluded airway. Both MIP and MEP are sensitive early indicators of respiratory muscle weakness.",

Salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, and other derivatives of N-PPG can be prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and described, for example, by March (1992) Advanced Organic Chemistry; Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 4th Ed. N.Y. Wiley-Interscience.",
                                "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable, inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycollic, lactic, salicyclic, succinic, gluconic, isethionic, glycinic, malic, mucoic, glutammic, sulphamic, ascorbic acid; toluene-p-sulfonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic, trifluoroacetic and benzenesulfonic acids. Salts derived from appropriate bases include but are not limited to alkali such as sodium and ammonium.",
                                "For example, acid addition salts are prepared from the free base using conventional methodology that typically involves reaction with a suitable acid. Generally, the base form of the drug is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol and the acid is added thereto. The resulting salt either precipitates or can be brought out of solution by addition of a less polar solvent. Suitable acids for preparing acid addition salts include both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. An acid addition salt may be reconverted to the free base by treatment with a suitable base. Illustrative acid addition salts are halide salts, such as may be prepared using hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. Conversely, basic salts of are prepared in a similar manner using a pharmaceutically acceptable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, trimethylamine, or the like. Illustrative basic salts include alkali metal salts, e.g., the sodium salt, and copper salts.",

The esters are typically acyl-substituted derivatives of free alcohol groups, i.e., moieties that are derived from carboxylic acids of the formula RCOOH where R is alky, and preferably is lower alkyl. Esters can be reconverted to the free acids, if desired, by using conventional hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis procedures.",
                                "Amides and prodrugs can also be prepared using techniques known to those skilled in the art or described in the pertinent literature. For example, amides may be prepared from esters, using suitable amine reactants, or they may be prepared from an anhydride or an acid chloride by reaction with ammonia or a lower alkyl amine. Prodrugs are typically prepared by covalent attachment of a moiety that results in a compound that is therapeutically inactive until modified by an individual's metabolic system.",
                                "N-PPG can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (excipient), such as are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th editions, Osol, ed., 1980. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can contain one or more physiologically acceptable compound(s) that act, for example, to stabilize the composition or to increase or decrease the absorption of the active agent (N-PPG). A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for use in the methods described herein is non-toxic to cells, tissues, or subjects at the dosages employed, and can include a buffer (such as a phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, and buffers made from other organic acids), an antioxidant (e.g., ascorbic acid), a low-molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) peptide, a polypeptide (such as serum albumin, gelatin, and an immunoglobulin), a hydrophilic polymer (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone), an amino acid (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, and/or lysine), a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, and/or other carbohydrates (including glucose, mannose, and dextrins), a chelating agent (e.g., ethylenediaminetetratacetic acid (EDTA)), a sugar alcohol (such as mannitol and sorbitol), a salt-forming counterion (e.g., sodium), and/or an anionic surfactant (such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122, and PEG). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH-buffered solution.",
                                "Other pharmaceutically acceptable compounds include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents or preservatives that are particularly useful for preventing the growth or action of microorganisms. Various preservatives are well known and include, for example, phenol and ascorbic acid. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the choice of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier(s), including a physiologically acceptable compound depends, for example, on the route of administration N-PPG and on the particular physio-chemical characteristics of this compound.",

Such compositions are typically sterile when administered to subjects. Sterilization of an aqueous solution is readily accomplished by filtration through a sterile filtration membrane. If the composition is stored in lyophilized form, the composition can be filtered before or after lyophilization and reconstitution.",
                                "N-PPG can exist in different stereoisomeric forms including enantiomers of (+) and (\u2212) type or mixtures of them. In various embodiments, the use of either the individual isomers or the mixtures thereof is contemplated herein.",
                                "It will be understood that, when mixtures of optical isomers are present, they may be separated according to the classic resolution methods based on their different physicochemical properties, e.g., by fractional crystallization of their acid addition salts with a suitable optically active acid or by the chromatographic separation with a suitable mixture of solvents.",
                                "Administration",
                                "The N-PPG can be administered by any convenient route of administration. In various embodiments, N-PPG can be administered by intravenous, intraarterial, intrathecal, intradermal, intracavitary, oral, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitonial, topical, buccal, and/or nasal routes of administration. In various embodiments, the N-PPG can be administered orally, in which case delivery can be enhanced by the use of protective excipients. This is typically accomplished either by complexing the N-PPG with a composition to render it resistant to acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis or by packaging the N-PPG in an appropriately resistant carrier. Means of protecting agents for oral delivery are well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,377).",
                                "Elevated serum half-life can be maintained by the use of sustained-release \u201cpackaging\u201d systems. Such sustained release systems are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Tracy (1998) Biotechnol. Prog. 14: 108; Johnson et al. (1996), Nature Med. 2: 795; Herbert et al. (1998), Pharmaceut. Res. 15, 357).",
                                "Suitable pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. Suitable unit dosage forms, include, but are not limited to powders, tablets, pills, capsules, lozenges, suppositories, patches, nasal sprays, injectables, implantable sustained-release formulations, lipid complexes, etc. In another embodiment, one or more components of a solution can be provided as a \u201cconcentrate,\u201d e.g., in a storage container (e.g., in a premeasured volume) ready for dilution or in a soluble capsule ready for addition to a volume of water.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the N-PPG may also be delivered through the skin using conventional transdermal drug delivery systems, i.e., transdermal \u201cpatches\u201d wherein the N-PPG is contained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the drug composition is typically contained in a layer, or \u201creservoir,\u201d underlying an upper backing layer. It will be appreciated that the term \u201creservoir\u201d in this context refers to a quantity of \u201cactive ingredient(s)\u201d that is ultimately available for delivery to the surface of the skin. Thus, for example, the \u201creservoir\u201d may include the active ingredient(s) in an adhesive on a backing layer of the patch, or in any of a variety of different matrix formulations known to those of skill in the art. The patch may contain a single reservoir, or it may contain multiple reservoirs.",
                                "In one embodiment, the reservoir comprises a polymeric matrix of a pharmaceutically acceptable contact adhesive material that serves to affix the system to the skin during drug delivery. Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to polyethylenes, polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, and the like. Alternatively, the drug-containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this case, may be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it may be a liquid or hydrogel reservoir or may take some other form. The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper surface of the device, preferably functions as a primary structural element of the \u201cpatch\u201d and provides the device with much of its flexibility. The material selected for the backing layer is preferably substantially impermeable to the N-PPG and any other materials that are present.",
                                "In certain embodiments, the N-PPG is administered alone or in combination with other therapeutics in implantable (e.g., subcutaneous) matrices, termed \u201cdepot formulations.\u201d",
                                "A major problem with standard drug dosing is that typical delivery of drugs results in a quick burst of medication at the time of dosing, followed by a rapid loss of the drug from the body. Most of the side effects of a drug occur during the burst phase of its release into the bloodstream. Secondly, the time the drug is in the bloodstream at therapeutic levels is very short; most is used and cleared during the short burst.",
                                "Drugs (e.g., N-PPG) imbedded in various matrix materials for sustained release can mitigate these problems. Drugs embedded, for example, in polymer beads or in polymer wafers have several advantages. First, most systems allow slow release of the drug, thus creating a continuous dosing of the body with small levels of drug. This typically prevents side effects associated with high burst levels of normal injected or pill-based drugs. Secondly, since these polymers can be made to release over hours to months, the therapeutic span of the drug is markedly increased. Often, by mixing different ratios of the same polymer components, polymers of different degradation rates can be made, allowing remarkable flexibilit. A long rate of drug release is beneficial for people who might have trouble staying on regular dosage, such as the elderly, but also represents an ease of use improvement that everyone can appreciate. Most polymers can be made to degrade and be cleared by the body over time, so they will not remain in the body after the therapeutic interval.",
                                "Another advantage of polymer-based drug delivery is that the polymers often can stabilize or solubilize proteins, peptides, and other large molecules that would otherwise be unusable as medications. Finally, many drug/polymer mixes can be placed directly in the disease area, allowing specific targeting of the medication where it is needed without losing drug to the \u201cfirst pass\u201d effect. This is certainly effective for treating the brain, which is often deprived of medicines that can't penetrate the blood/brain barrier.",
                                "A wide variety of approaches to designing depot formulations that can provide sustained release of N-PPG are known and are suitable for use in the methods described herein. Generally, the components of such formulations are biocompatible and may be biodegradable. Biocompatible polymeric materials have been used extensively in therapeutic drug delivery and medical implant applications to effect a localized and sustained release (see, e.g., Leong et al. (1987) Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 1:199-233; Langer (1990) Science, 249: 1527-1533; and the like). Such delivery systems offer the potential of enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced overall toxicity.",
                                "Examples of classes of synthetic polymers that have been studied as possible solid biodegradable materials include polyesters (Pitt et al., \u201cBiodegradable Drug Delivery Systems Based on Aliphatic Polyesters: Applications to Contraceptives and Narcotic Antagonists,\u201d Controlled Release of Bioactive Materials, 19-44 (Richard Baker ed. (1980); Poly(amino acids) and pseudo-poly(amino acids) (Pulapura et al. (1992) J. Biomaterials Appl., 6(1): 216-250); polyurethanes (Bruin et al. (1990) Biomaterials, 11(4): 291-295); polyorthoesters (Heller et al. (1981) Polymer Engineering Sci., 21(11): 727-731); and polyanhydrides (Leong et al. (1986) Biomaterials 7(5): 364-371).",
                                "Thus, for example, N-PPG can be incorporated into a biocompatible polymeric composition and formed into the desired shape outside the body. This solid implant is then typically inserted into the body of the subject through an incision. Alternatively, small discrete particles composed of these polymeric compositions can be injected into the body, e.g., using a syringe. In an illustrative embodiment, N-PPG can be encapsulated in microspheres of poly (D,L-lactide) polymer suspended in a diluent of water, mannitol, carboxymethyl-cellulose, and polysorbate 80. The polylactide polymer is gradually metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, releasing the N-PPG into the system.",
