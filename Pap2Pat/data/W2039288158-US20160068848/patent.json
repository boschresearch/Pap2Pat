                        "The capacity to produce high levels of alcohol is a very rare characteristic in nature. It is most prominent in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is able to accumulate in the absence of cell proliferation, ethanol concentrations in the medium of more than 17%, a level that kills virtually all competing microorganisms. As a result, this property allows this yeast to outcompete all other microorganisms in environments rich enough in sugar to sustain the production of such high ethanol levels (Casey and Ingledew, 1986; D'Amore and Stewart, 1987). Very few other microorganisms, e.g., the yeast Dekkera bruxellensis, have independently evolved a similar but less pronounced ethanol tolerance compared to S. cerevisiae (Rozpedowska et al., 2011). The capacity to accumulate high ethanol levels lie at the basis of the production of nearly all alcoholic beverages as well as bioethanol in industrial fermentations by the yeast S. cerevisiae. Originally, all alcoholic beverages were produced with spontaneous fermentations in which S. cerevisiae gradually increases in abundance, in parallel with the increase in the ethanol level, to finally dominate the fermentation at the end.",
                        "The genetic basis of yeast alcohol tolerance, particularly ethanol tolerance has attracted much attention but until recently nearly all research was performed with laboratory yeast strains, which display much lower alcohol tolerance than the natural and industrial yeast strains. This research has pointed to properties like membrane lipid composition, chaperone protein expression and trehalose content, as major requirements for ethanol tolerance of laboratory strains (D'Amore and Stewart, 1987; Ding et al., 2009) but the role played by these factors in other genetic backgrounds and in establishing tolerance to very high ethanol levels has remained unknown. We have recently performed polygenic analysis of the high ethanol tolerance of a Brazilian bioethanol production strain VR1. This revealed the involvement of several genes previously never connected to ethanol tolerance and did not identify genes affecting properties classically considered to be required for ethanol tolerance in lab strains (Swinnen et al., 2012a).",
                        "A second shortcoming of most previous studies is the assessment of alcohol tolerance solely by measuring growth on nutrient plates in the presence of increasing alcohol levels. (D'Amore and Stewart, 1987; Ding et al., 2009). This is a convenient assay, which allows hundreds of strains or segregants to be phenotyped simultaneously with little work and manpower. However, the real physiological and ecological relevance of alcohol tolerance in S. cerevisiae is its capacity to accumulate by fermentation high alcohol levels in the absence of cell proliferation. This generally happens in an environment with a large excess of sugar compared to other essential nutrients. As a result, a large part of the alcohol in a typical, natural or industrial, yeast fermentation is produced with stationary phase cells in the absence of any cell proliferation. The alcohol tolerance of the yeast under such conditions determines its maximal alcohol accumulation capacity, a specific property of high ecological and industrial importance. In industrial fermentations, a higher maximal alcohol accumulation capacity allows a better attenuation of the residual sugar and, therefore, results in a higher yield. A higher final alcohol titer reduces the distillation costs and also lowers the liquid volumes in the factory, which has multiple beneficial effects on costs of heating, cooling, pumping and transport of liquid residue. It also lowers microbial contamination and the higher alcohol tolerance of the yeast generally also enhances the rate of fermentation especially in the later stages of the fermentation process. Maximal alcohol accumulation capacity can only be determined in individual yeast fermentations, which are much more laborious to perform than growth tests on plates. In static industrial fermentations, maintenance of the yeast in suspension is due to the strong CO2 bubbling and this can only be mimicked in lab scale with a sufficient amount of cells in a sufficiently large volume.",
                        "The advent of high-throughput methods for genome sequencing has created a breakthrough also in the field of quantitative or complex trait analysis in yeast (Liti and Lewis, 2012; Swinnen et al., 2012b). The new methodology has allowed efficient QTL mapping of several complex traits (Swinnen et al., 2012a; Ehrenreich et al., 2010; Parts et al., 2011) and reciprocal hemizygosity analysis (Steinmetz et al., 2002) has facilitated identification of the causative genes. The efficiency of the new methodologies calls for new challenges to be addressed, such as comparison of the genetic basis of related complex properties. In addition, complex trait analysis in yeast has been applied up to now mainly to phenotypic properties that are easy to score in hundreds or even thousands of segregants (Swinnen et al., 2012a; Ehrenreich et al., 2010; Parts et al., 2011; Steinmetz et al., 2002; Winzeler et al., 1998; Deutschbauer and Davis, 2005; Brem et al., 2002; Marullo et al., 2007; Nogami et al., 2007; Perlstein et al., 2007). However, many phenotypic traits with high ecological or industrial relevance require more elaborate experimental protocols for assessment and it is not fully clear yet whether the low numbers of segregants that can be scored in these cases are adequate for genetic mapping with pooled-segregant whole-genome sequence analysis."

                        "Surprisingly, we found that a KIN3 allele can modulate alcohol tolerance and/or accumulation: one specific allele allows a higher alcohol accumulation, while another specific allele of the same KIN3 gene results in lower alcohol accumulation. The forms can be combined with other specific alleles, from other genes, to obtain a maximal or minimal alcohol accumulation, depending upon the use of the strain.",
                        "One aspect of the disclosure is the use of a KIN3 allele to modulate alcohol accumulation and/or alcohol tolerance in yeast. Alcohol, as used herein, includes higher alcohols such as isobutanol. Preferably, the alcohol is ethanol. Preferably, the yeast is a Saccharomyces spp., such as, but not limited to, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The KIN3 allele may be combined with other alleles that allow modulation of alcohol accumulation and/or alcohol tolerance. As a non-limiting example, the alleles are selected from the group of genes consisting of ADE1, VPS70, MKT1, APJ1 and SWS2. In one preferred embodiment, the modulation is an increase in alcohol tolerance and/or alcohol accumulation. As a non-limiting example, an increase in alcohol tolerance and/or accumulation may be favorable for bio-ethanol production. Preferably, in order to obtain an increase in alcohol tolerance and/or alcohol accumulation, the KIN3 allele consists of SEQ ID NO:1. Preferably, the KIN3 allele, consisting of SEQ ID NO:1 is combined with specific alleles selected from the group of genes consisting of ADE1, VPS70, MKT1, APJ1 and SWS2. In one preferred embodiment, the specific APJ1 allele is an inactive allele, such as a deletion of the gene. In another preferred embodiment, the SWS2 allele is overexpressing the SWS2 protein. Even more preferably, the KIN3 allele is combined with specific alleles selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:2 (ADE1), SEQ ID NO:3 (VPS70), SEQ ID NO:5 (APJ1), SEQ ID NO:6 (SWS2) and a nucleic acid encoding SEQ ID NO:4 (MKT1). A preferred embodiment is the combination of SEQ ID NO:3 with SEQ ID NO:4, preferably in combination with the KIN3 allele.",
                        "In another preferred embodiment, the modulation is a decrease in alcohol tolerance and/or alcohol accumulation. As a non-limiting example, a decrease in ethanol accumulation is wanted in the production of wine, produced from grapes in a warm climate, as the high sugar content of the grapes may result in unwanted ethanol concentrations of 15% or more. Preferably, in order to obtain a decrease in alcohol tolerance and/or alcohol concentration, the KIN3 allele consists of SEQ ID NO:7. Even more preferably, the KIN3 allele, consisting of SEQ ID NO:7 is combined with specific alleles selected from the group of ADE1, VPS70, MKT1, APJ1 and SWS2. Even more preferably, the KIN3 allele is combine with specific alleles selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:8 (ADE1), SEQ ID NO:9 (VPS70), SEQ ID NO:11 (APJ1), SEQ ID NO:12 (SWS2) and a nucleic acid encoding SEQ ID NO:10 (MKT1).",

In one preferred embodiment, SEQ ID NO:1 is used for selecting a yeast strain with a higher alcohol tolerance and/or accumulation. In another preferred embodiment, SEQ ID NO:7 is used for selecting a yeast strain with a lower alcohol tolerance and/or accumulation. Preferably, the yeast is a Saccharomyces spp. The selection of the strain can be carried out with every method known to the person skilled in the art. As a non-limiting example, strains may be selected on the base of an identification of the allele by PCR or hybridization. The selection may be combined by a selection for other alleles, known to be involved in alcohol accumulation and/or alcohol tolerance, such as, but not limited to, specific alleles of ADE1, VPS70, MKT1, APJ1 or SWS2. The selection may be carried out simultaneously or consecutively. In case of a consecutive selection the sequence of the selection is not important, i.e., the selection using KIN3 may be carried out before or after the other selection rounds."

The HPLC system utilized (Waters Breeze) consisted of an ion-exclusion column (WAT010290) at 75\u00b0 C. and detection was performed by refractive index (model 2414). The eluent used was H2SO4 (5 mM) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Samples of 10 \u03bcL were automatically injected and processed for 20 min. Ethanol was quantified by near infrared spectroscopy (Alcolyzer, Anton Paar). Cell viability was assessed by oxonol staining followed by flow cytometry analysis (Boyd et al., 2003).

Smoothing of the sequencing data was performed with a Linearized Mixed Model (LMM) framework (Swinnen et al., 2012a; Claesen et al., 2013). We implemented a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify regions related with the phenotypes similar to the one implemented in the FastPHASE package (Sheet and Stephens, 2006). For each variant, the HMM has three possible states: (i) relation with the superior parent, (ii) relation with the control parent and (iii) no relation (background). To capture the effect of recombination, the transition between two states of the same type is the probability of no recombination and the probability of the transition between two states of different type is the probability of recombination divided by two. We estimated the probability of recombination for each pair of neighbor variants using a negative exponential relation with the physical distance as in Sheet and Stephens (2006). The emission of each state is the number of calls of the alternative allele which is an integer between zero and ni, where ni is the total number of allele calls for the variant i. We used beta-binomial distributions for all states to take into account the fact that given the finite number of segregants, the contribution of each parent to the pool is not exactly half For the superior parent states we setup \u03b1=10 and \u03b2=1. For the control parent states we set \u03b1=1 and \u03b2=10. For the background states we estimated \u03b1 and \u03b2 using the alternative allele frequencies in all sites. We checked that for the background distribution \u03b1\u2248\u03b2>1, which makes the background distribution to be close to a binomial with probability 0.5 (as expected). We used the forward-backward algorithm to calculate the posterior probability of each state given the allele counts for each dataset. A manuscript with a complete explanation of the algorithm and comparisons with currently available methods is in preparation. The QTLs detected were further analyzed by scoring SNPs in the segregants individually using allele-specific primer sets, which were rigorously tested for reliability with the two variants of each SNP in the parent strains and all segregants. Statistically significant QTLs were confirmed by multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) control (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005).",

All reads from the parental strain VR1-5B were mapped to the reference sequence using BFAST (Homer et al., 2009). To facilitate the discovery of repetitive regions in the genome of the parental strain VR1-5B, we retained for each read, its alignments with an edit distance difference from its best alignment smaller or equal to 5. About 90% of the reads from VR1-5B, about 80% of the reads from the pools of segregants under selection and about 96% of the reads from the pool of unselected segregants could be mapped to the latest reference genome. When verifying the mapping quality we observed that the error rate in the reads from VR1-5B, and the two pools of selected segregants increased above 2% in the last 20 bp. These last 20 bp of each read were, therefore, discarded when performing the mapping. We obtained an average coverage of 55\u00d7 for the read alignments of VR1-5B and the read alignments of the two pools of selected segregants as well as for the read alignments from the pool of unselected segregants.",

We also considered as repeats, regions already annotated in the reference genome as transposons, telomeres, centromeres, and paralog gene families. To identify copy number variants (CNVs) in the parental strain VR1-5B not yet annotated in the reference strain, we used the CNVnator algorithm (Abyzov et al., 2011). SNPs and small indels were identified with the SNVQ algorithm (Duitama et al., 2012), hereafter referred to as calls. Calls with posterior probability score less than 80, as well as calls falling inside repetitive or CNV regions were filtered out. Retained calls correspond to marker sites that allow distinguishing between both parental alleles (S288c and VR1-5B). Using our variant mapping and identification procedure, we identified 883 regions with multiple mappings and 2 804 novel CNVs that together with the 1 446 regions already annotated as repetitive regions comprised a total of 5 133 regions, covering 3.4 Mb (27.44%) of the genome.

A mapped read was discarded during frequency calculation when it had a base quality score less than 10 at the marker site or if it did not match any of the parental variants at the marker site. Resulting relative variant frequencies were used as input for EXPLoRA.",

In such hypothetical ideal case, a statistical test (e.g., binomial cumulative probability (Swinnen et al., 2012a)) could be applied to each genetic marker separately to assess the extent to which the variant frequency at the marker site deviates from the expected inheritance probability of 50%. In reality, spurious deviations of the observed variant frequencies from the theoretical 50% at marker sites will occur due to experimental error.",
                                "Additionally, linkage disequilibrium produces deviations of variant counts towards the superior variant, not only at the genetic marker sites causative to the phenotype of interest, but also in genetic marker sites closely located to these causative marker sites. This dependence between the variant frequency of neighboring sites violates the assumptions of independently linking variants to a phenotype of interest, according to a binomial distribution. However, when properly accounted for in the BSA analysis model, this dependency between neighboring sites can help increasing the power of the statistical linkage of the loci with the phenotype of interest and in filtering out spurious hits that are due to experimental errors.",
                                "Therefore, to use the information contained in the dependency between neighboring marker sites, we developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) called EXPLoRA (FIG. 9). For each marker site, we model two possible states: one state (P-state) expresses that the variants in the pool at that marker site originate predominantly (but not always in all segregants) from the superior parent and are thus linked to the phenotype of interest. A second state (N-state) models that the variants in the pool at a given marker site result to an equal extent from either parent, in which case the marker site is assumed to be located in a neutral region not linked to the phenotype of interest. The effect of linkage disequilibrium is modeled by the transition probabilities \u03c4 between two neighboring marker sites. The transition probability \u03c4 models the chance that a neighboring site remains in the same state as its preceding site state. Its distribution is described by a negative exponential model as a function of the recombination rate and thus the physical distance between neighboring marker sites (Sheet and Stephens, 2006) (FIG. 9C). The probability to change states upon transition from one marker site to a neighboring marker site (from a neutral N-state to a phenotype-linked P-state or vice versa) is then described by 1-\u03c4. The model captures the fact that marker sites located in each other's physical neighborhood are likely to be in linkage disequilibrium and less likely to change their state (from P to N or from N to P). Given a random state Ni or Pi at a marker site \u201ci,\u201d the transition probabilities to the states Ni+1 or Pi+1 for the neighboring marker site \u201ci+1\u201d are given by:",

                                "Each state in the model emits a random variable nA, corresponding to the number of variant counts at a given marker site originating from the superior parent. nA ranges from 0 to n, with n being equal to the (known) total variant count for the marker site, and is described by a beta binomial distribution which allows capturing different emission probabilities in phenotype-linked versus neutral states by choosing different \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters for their corresponding distributions (FIG. 9B). We modeled all neutral states with the same parameters \u03b1N and \u03b2N, and all phenotype-linked states with the same parameters \u03b1p and \u03b2p. While for the neutral states \u03b1N should almost equal \u03b2N to make values of nA closer to n/2 more likely to be sampled, for the phenotype-linked states \u03b1p should be much larger than \u03b2p to make values of nA close to n more likely to be sampled.",

To this end, we implemented a two-step process in which we first assume that most of the genomic regions are phenotype-neutral. We estimate with the method of moments the most likely values of \u03b1N and \u03b2N given the variant frequencies at each marker site. Then in a second step we identify the marker sites linked to the phenotype of interest using the model, and we estimate again \u03b1N and \u03b2N leaving out the marker sites identified to be linked to the phenotype. \u03b1p and \u03b2p are adjustable parameters. In our experiments, we fixed \u03b2p equal to 1 and tested different values of \u03b1p (5, 10, 20, and 50). A cut-off on the obtained posterior probability of each marker site to be linked to the phenotype was used to prioritize the most likely causative marker sites for the phenotype of interest.",

The SHORE output for marker sites between the parental strain VR1-5B and the S288c reference genome agreed in 98% of the cases with the data obtained by BFAST and our filtering rules (see above). This made it possible to directly compare our EXPLoRA methodology with SHOREmap (Schneeberger et al., 2009) for further prioritization of variants originating from the superior parent linked to the phenotype of interest. To this end, relative variant frequencies derived from read alignments of the pools by SHORE were used as input for SHOREmap. A cut-off on the linkage scores at each marker site provided by SHOREmap was used to prioritize markers as being linked to the phenotype of interest. To obtain the optimal parameter setting for SHOREmap in this analysis, we ran the application with different window sizes. Eventually, a window size of 250 kb and step of 10 kb were chosen as this maximized the number of genetic marker sites with a normalized score \u22670.9 in the positive benchmark set.",

The unselected pool should be of similar size in number of segregants as the selected pool, which is true for the case of the pool selected for tolerance to 16% ethanol (136 segregants in the selected pool versus 131 in the unselected one). To generate a corresponding unselected pool for the pool of segregants selected for tolerance to 17% ethanol, we sampled from the original unselected pool the same number of segregants as was present in this selected pool, that is 31.",

Marker sites predicted to be linked to the phenotype based on a spurious deviation in relative variant frequency are not expected to be located in large regions. As a result, we expect that the average size of a predicted linked region in the unselected pools will be considerably smaller than in the selected pool. We, therefore, estimated as \u201cfalsely linked regions\u201d in the selected pool, these predicted linked regions for which the size in by was smaller than the 90 percentile largest predicted linked region observed in the unselected pool. This allowed us to calculate a false positive rate at the level of linked regions as the number of \u201cfalsely linked regions\u201d divided by the total number of predicted linked regions in the unselected pool at the same chosen cut-off.",

Strains with a higher ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation tended to produce higher maximal ethanol levels. This was most pronounced in the strains able to grow in the presence of 20% ethanol on plates.

The laboratory strain BY710 (derived from BY4742; same genotype: Mat\u03b1 his3\u03941 leu2\u03940 ura3\u03940 lys2\u03940) showed a lower fermentation rate and also a much lower maximal ethanol accumulation capacity, which was only around 12% (v/v) (FIGS. 2A and 2B). The a mating type of the Seg5 strain was stable and FACS analysis confirmed that its DNA content was half that of its diploid parent CBS1585 (data not shown). We have crossed Seg5 with BY710 to obtain the diploid Seg5/BY710, which showed a similar high fermentation rate (FIG. 2A) and high ethanol accumulation capacity (FIG. 2B) as the original CBS1585 diploid strain. Growth assays on solid media, with or without glucose, and containing different levels of ethanol, showed that CBS1585, Seg5 and Seg5/BY710 had a similar ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation whereas the laboratory strain (BY710) was much more sensitive (FIG. 2C). These results indicate that the two ethanol tolerance traits are dominant characteristics in the strain backgrounds used.",

                                "We have investigated whether ethanol tolerance as determined by the classical assays of cell proliferation on solid nutrient plates containing different levels of ethanol, correlates with maximal ethanol accumulation capacity in fermenting cells in the absence of cell proliferation. For that purpose, Seg5 was crossed with BY710, the Seg5/BY710 diploid sporulated and the segregants were first plated on solid media containing glucose and/or ethanol (18% to 20% v/v). FIG. 3A shows a representative result. The haploid parent Seg5 showed high tolerance of cell proliferation to ethanol whereas the laboratory strain BY710 was much more ethanol sensitive. Among the segregants we could observe some with very high ethanol tolerance (e.g., Seg 11C), some with intermediate tolerance (e.g., Seg 10A) and others that were as ethanol sensitive as the laboratory strain (e.g., Seg 11D). Out of 301 segregants evaluated in this way, 101 segregants showed moderate to high ethanol tolerance, whereas about half of the segregants (48.8%) could not grow at all on plates containing 18 or 20% ethanol (v/v). In the first category, 32 segregants showed an ethanol tolerance level as high as Seg5. Hence, about 1 in 9 segregants showed the same high ethanol tolerance as the superior parent. If we suppose random segregation of the loci and no epistasis, this ratio predicts three independent loci as being involved in determining the high ethanol tolerance of Seg5 compared to the laboratory strain BY710.",
                                "Subsequently, we tested 15 ethanol sensitive segregants (similar to Seg11D of FIG. 3A) by fermentation in 250 mL of YP+33% (w/v) glucose. All 15 segregants clearly showed poor fermentation performance, with a low ethanol accumulation capacity (<14% v/v) (not shown). This suggests that there is a correlation between ethanol tolerance as measured by the cell proliferation assays on solid nutrient plates and maximal ethanol accumulation capacity in VHG fermentation, at least for the ethanol sensitive strains. Hence, to reduce the high workload required for phenotyping all segregants in fermentations, we tested in the small-scale fermentations only the 101 segregants that showed moderate to high ethanol tolerance in the growth assays on solid nutrient plates. We are aware that the strains with poor ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation may contain mutant genes that compromise maximal ethanol accumulation capacity or that when these strains show relatively high maximal ethanol accumulation capacity, they may contain (in part) different mutant alleles than the strains with high ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation. The main purpose of this work, however, was to identify the first set of major causative genes determining maximal ethanol accumulation capacity and this is the main reason why we continued first with the strains preselected for medium to high ethanol tolerance of growth.",
                                "The distribution of maximal ethanol accumulation capacity among the 101 segregants, as tested in semi-static small-scale fermentations in 250 mL of YP+33% (w/v) glucose, is shown in FIG. 3B. Only 22 segregants produced ethanol titres higher than 17% (v/v), similar to the ethanol production of Seg5 and Seg5/BY710. If we assume that all ethanol sensitive segregants, as determined by growth assays on solid nutrient plates, also display poor maximal ethanol accumulation, we have a ratio of one superior strain in \u00b114 segregants (301/22=13.7). Assuming random segregation of the QTLs and no epistasis, this ratio is consistent with four independent loci being responsible for the superior ethanol accumulation capacity of Seg5 compared to the BY710 control strain. We constructed several diploids by crossing the four best performing segregants but none of those showed higher ethanol accumulation capacity than the original CBS 1585 diploid strain (data not shown).",

                                "We have performed genetic mapping of the two polygenic traits: on the one hand, high ethanol accumulation capacity in fermenting cells in the absence of cell proliferation, using the 22 best-performing segregants (pool 1) as determined in semi-static VHG fermentations, and on the other hand, tolerance of cell proliferation to high ethanol levels, using the 32 segregants (pool 2) that showed the best growth on solid nutrient media containing 18 to 20% (v/v) ethanol. Identification of the QTLs was performed by pooled-segregant whole genome sequence analysis (Swinnen et al., 2012a; Liti and Louis, 2012; Ehrenreich et al., 2010; Parts et al., 2011). Genomic DNA was sent for custom whole-genome sequence analysis by the Illumina platform, to two independent companies (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, and BGI, Hong Kong). The sequencing parameters are summarized in the Methods section. Sequence analysis of the genome of the superior parent Seg5 and comparison to S288c, allowed us to select 48,512 high-quality SNPs after filtering for sufficient coverage (\u226720 times) and ratio (\u226780%) (Swinnen et al., 2012a; Claesen et al., 2013). The coverage of at least 20 times was based on previous findings that a 20-fold sequencing coverage is sufficient to compensate for errors by the number of correct reads (Dohm et al., 2008). The ratio of at least 80% was chosen based on the plots of the SNPs between the two parent strains, as described previously (Swinnen et al., 2012a). We also mapped the reads to the assembled sequence for the Kyokai n\u00b07 strain available in the Saccharomyces genome database (Akao et al., 2011). We were able to map about 20,000 additional reads to this sequence and 93% of the total read pairs aligned with proper distance and orientation to the Kyokai n\u00b07 assembly, while only 87% of the read pairs mapped in the same way to S288c. We also identified the sake strain specific genes AWA1 and BIO6 (Akao et al., 2011), which further confirmed that CBS1585 belongs to the sake cluster of S. cerevisiae strains.",
                                "Genomic DNA was extracted from the two selected pools, containing 22 and 32 segregants, respectively, and also from an unselected pool, composed of 237 segregants (pool 3) in order to assess proper segregation of all chromosomes and possible links to inadvertently selected traits, such as sporulation capacity or spore viability. After sequence analysis, the SNP variant frequency was plotted against the chromosomal position (FIG. 4). Upward deviations from the mean of 0.5 identify QTLs linked to the superior parent Seg5 while downward deviations identify QTLs linked to the inferior parent BY710. The independent sequence analysis by the two different companies produced very similar results, which confirms the robustness of the pooled-segregant whole-genome sequencing technology. The raw sequencing data were smoothed using a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) framework (Swinnen et al., 2012a) and the putative QTLs were identified by applying a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) similar to the one implemented in the FastPHASE package (Sheet and Stephens, 2006). For each polymorphism, the HMM had three possible states: (i) a link with the superior parent (Seg5), (ii) a link with the inferior parent (BY710) and (iii) no link (background level). The SNP frequencies for each pool of segregants, analyzed with the HMM, were assigned probability scores, that indicated to which state (Seg5, BY710 or background) they belonged and hence identified the QTLs, linked to either the superior parent (Seg5) or to the inferior parent (BY710).",
                                "The smoothed data of the SNP variant frequency and the probability of linkage values obtained by HMM analysis with the selected pools 1 and 2 and the unselected pool 3, are shown in FIG. 4. The QTLs identified with the HMM approach are listed in Tables 4 and 5 for pools 1 and 2, respectively. SNPs were considered significantly linked to the superior or inferior parent strain when the probability of linkage was higher than 0.95 or lower than \u22120.95, respectively. The QTLs were numbered, according to their position in the genome, starting from chromosome I, independently of the trait (Tables 4 and 5).",
                                "The unselected pool 3 (237 segregants) showed \u00b150% SNP variant frequency in most of the genome and thus no evidence of any QTLs (FIG. 4). The only exception was the right arm of chromosome V which was preferentially inherited from the BY parent strain. Comparison with the data of the selected pools, suggested some weak linkage with the genome of the BY parent strain in this part of chromosome V. Because of the weak linkage this was not retained for further analysis. Crosses of Seg5 with other BY strains did not show aberrant segregation of the right arm of chromosome V (results not shown). The results obtained with the unselected pool show that the QTLs identified for the two ethanol tolerance traits were not due to linkage with inadvertently selected traits, such as sporulation capacity or spore viability.",
                                "The QTLs identified with the selected pools 1 and 2 showed two common QTLs (on chr XIII and chr XV). They were called 12.1 and 17.1 for pool 1 and 12.2 and 17.2 for pool 2. It has to be emphasized that the \u201ccommon\u201d character of these QTLs is only based on their common location in the genome. In principle, they could be located in the same place on a chromosome but caused by a different causative gene. Moreover, the QTLs 15 and 16 (pool 2) were also present in pool 1 as minor putative QTL of which the significance could not be demonstrated with the current number of segregants (probability of linkage<0.95). Other minor putative QTLs of which the significance could not be demonstrated with the current number of segregants (probability of linkage <0.95) were present in pool 1 and pool 2. They were also evident from the smoothed data and the HMM analysis (FIG. 4) (e.g., on chromosome VII). These loci might contain genes that contribute to some extent to ethanol tolerance but are not essential for maximal ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation or for maximal ethanol accumulation in fermentation under the conditions and the stringency that we applied. Alternatively, they can contain alleles with an important contribution to high ethanol tolerance but which are redundant with one or more other alleles. If the different alleles have no additive effect, the presence of one allele suffices and its QTL will always remain a minor QTL, whatever the stringency applied in phenotyping.",

QTL2 is located on chromosome I and was fine-mapped by scoring selected markers in the 22 individual segregants. This reduced the length of the QTL to the area between chromosomal positions 151 kb and 178 kb (P-value <0.05) (FIG. 5A). The association percentage of the markers, their genomic positions, the respective P-values and the genes located in the putative QTL 1 are shown in FIG. 5A.",
                                "Nearly all genes present in the center of the QTL had at least on polymorphism either in the ORF, promotor or terminator. Hence, it was not possible to exclude on this basis a significant number of genes as candidate causative genes. Because of the large number of candidate genes and the high workload of the phenotyping for maximal ethanol accumulation capacity, we have introduced a modification of the Reciprocal Hemizygosity Analysis (RHA) methodology, which has been used previously for identification of causative genes (Steinmetz et al., 2002). Instead of testing one candidate gene at a time, we first evaluated a series of adjacent genes by \u201cbulk RHA.\u201d For that purpose a set of adjacent genes was deleted directly in the heterozygous diploid background (Seg5/BY710) so as to obtain the two reciprocally deleted hemizygous diploids of which the phenotype was subsequently compared. The first block of genes (bRHA 1.1) deleted, consisted of NUP60, ERP1, SWD1, RFA1 and SEN34. The two reciprocally deleted diploid strains were tested by fermentation in YP+33% (w/v) glucose, to address the effect of the Seg5 and BY710 alleles on ethanol accumulation capacity. The results showed no difference in the fermentation profile and maximal ethanol accumulation (FIG. 5B), suggesting that none of these five genes were causative genes. There was also no difference in fermentation profile and maximal ethanol accumulation with the hybrid parent strain Seg5/BY710, further supporting that these genes did not influence these phenotypes.",

In this case there was a clear reduction of the fermentation rate and maximal ethanol accumulation when the alleles of the Seg5 strain were absent compared to absence of the BY710 alleles (FIG. 5C). Glucose leftover correlated inversely with final ethanol titer. This suggested the presence of one or more causative genes in this region. Moreover, the fermentation rate was higher in the hemizygous strain where the BY710 alleles were absent compared to the hybrid parent strain Seg5/BY710, indicating that one or more of the BY710 alleles had a negative effect on this phenotype.",
                                "YARCdelta3/4/5, YARCTy1-1, YAR009c and YAR010c are transposable elements, while tA(UGC)A encodes one of the sixteen tRNAs for the amino acid alanine. BUD14 is involved in bud-site selection (Cullen and Sprague, 2002), ADE1 is involved in de novo purine biosynthesis (Myasnikov et al., 1991), KIN3 encodes a non-essential serine/threonine protein kinase involved in a.o. DNA damage repair (Moura et al., 2010) and CDC15 encodes a protein kinase involved in control of the cell division cycle ((Bardin et al., 2003). In order to identify the genes(s) involved in ethanol accumulation capacity, we investigated the most likely candidate genes individually with the classical one-gene RHA (Steinmetz et al., 2002). Involvement of the transposable elements appeared unlikely and was not evaluated by RHA. The other genes, BUD14, ADE1, KIN3 and CDC15, have polymorphisms (SNPs and/or indels) within their ORFs and/or promoter regions. RHA with the genes ADE1 and KIN3 showed that deletion of the Seg5 alleles resulted in strains with clearly lower ethanol accumulation capacity and higher glucose leftover compared to the strain with deletion of the respective BY allele, indicating that ADE1 and KIN3 are causative genes for high ethanol accumulation capacity in Seg5 (FIG. 6A). For both genes, the hybrid parent strain Seg5/BY710 behaved in a similar way as the strain with the deleted BY710 allele. For CDC15 and BUD14 there was no difference in the performance of the two reciprocally deleted diploid strains (not shown). Deletion of ADE1 and KIN3 in the Seg5 and BY backgrounds caused a more pronounced effect in the Seg5 sake genetic background (FIG. 6B).",
                                "The causative genes ADE1 and KIN3 were located in QTL2, which was not linked with ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation. When we tested the hybrid diploid strains previously used in RHA for maximal ethanol accumulation for determination of ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation, we could indeed not observe any significant difference between the two strains (FIG. 6C). This confirms that these causative genes are specific for maximal ethanol accumulation capacity and that the genetic basis of the two ethanol tolerance traits is indeed partially different.",
                                "We also analyzed in more detail QTL3, located on chromosome V. In the same chromosomal region, Swinnen et al., 2012a, previously identified URA3 as a causative gene in tolerance of cell proliferation to high ethanol levels of VR1, a Brazilian bioethanol production strain, in comparison with BY4741 as inferior parent strain. Since we crossed Seg5 with an ura3 auxotrophic laboratory strain (BY710), we first tested whether deletion of URA3 in Seg5 affected maximal ethanol accumulation in this genetic background. The fermentation profile and maximal ethanol accumulation of the strain Seg5-ura3\u0394/BY710-ura3\u0394 (which is thus homozygous for ura3\u0394) compared with the Seg5/BY710-ura3\u0394 diploid (which is heterozygous for ura3\u0394) are shown in FIG. 7A. Double deletion of URA3 resulted in a strain with a reduced ethanol fermentation rate, lower maximal ethanol accumulation and higher glucose leftover. We have also tested the effect of introducing URA3 in the ura3 auxotrophic strain BY4741, which accumulates only low amounts of ethanol under VHG conditions (\u00b112% v/v). Introduction of URA3 enhanced the fermentation rate in the later stages of the fermentation and resulted in a clearly higher maximal ethanol titer and lower glucose leftover (FIG. 7B). These results show that URA3 positively affects maximal ethanol accumulation capacity. The URA3 gene was located in QTL3, which was not significantly linked with ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation. When we tested the hybrid diploid strains previously used in RHA for maximal ethanol accumulation for determination of ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation, we observed slightly better growth for the strain with the URA3 allele from Seg5 (FIG. 7C). This confirms that URA3 has only a minor contribution to this phenotype in this genetic background and suggests that the very weak upward deviation in the SNP variant frequency plot observed in this position for ethanol tolerance of cell proliferation might have been due to the URA3 gene.",

We have checked the presence of these SNPs in the ADE1 and KIN3 genes of 36 yeast strains of which the whole genome sequence has been published. The results are shown in Table 6. (Among the 36 strains there were additional SNPs compared to S288c, which were not present in Seg5. These SNPs are not shown). The C to T change at position 169227 in ADE1 is present only in two other strains, Kyokai nr. 7 and UC5. Both strains are sake strains and these strains are known to have superior maximal ethanol accumulation capacity. Sake fermentation produces the highest ethanol level of all yeast fermentations for production of alcoholic beverages (Kodama, 1993). The SNPs in KIN3 of Seg5 at positions 170564 and 170945 are present in many other strains. Interestingly, however, the two other SNPs in KIN3 of Seg5, at positions 170852 (in the ORF) and 171947 (in the promoter) are not present in KIN3 of any one of the 36 sequenced strains and, therefore, may be rather unique.",

This allows better approximating the size (number of nucleotides) of the linked region to the minimum that is supported by the resolution of the BSA.",
                                "We used this positive set of linked QTLs and the refined delineation of the linked region in these QTLs to test the effect of altering parameter settings on modeling the dependencies between neighboring marker sites with EXPLoRA: more specifically we varied \u03b1P (5, 10, 20, and 50) given a fixed value of \u03b2P, as the ratio between \u03b1P and \u03b2P determines the extent to which the effect of the dependency between neighboring marker sites (linkage disequilibrium) is taken into account.",
                                "EXPLoRA predicts the posterior probability of marker sites linked to the phenotype on chromosome XIV (QTL3) for different values of \u03b1P. For this strongly linked QTL, causative marker sites located in regions that are truly linked to the phenotype of interest always get prioritized, irrespective of the choice of \u03b1P (as can be seen by the high posterior probabilities at their respective marker sites: >0.95). However, gradually increasing \u03b1P values gives rise to more peaked and less well defined linked regions, because at high values of \u03b1P only marker sites with relative variant frequencies close to 1 get high posterior probabilities and the effect of \u201cneighboring markers\u201d on increasing the probability of a neighboring marker site to also belong to a phenotype-linked region becomes marginal. We choose in our analysis \u03b1P=10, as with this value we best approximated the experimentally fine-mapped phenotype linked region of QTL3 (Swinnen et al., 2012a).",
                                "For benchmarking we compared the performance of our method with that of, respectively, SHOREmap (Schneeberger et al., 2009), a method that has been customarily used for BSA, as well as the novel statistical model for BSA described in the paper of Swinnen et al., 2012a, because both methods were developed for a very similar set up as the one used in this study. Like our HMM model, both methods cope with spurious deviations in variant frequencies by averaging out the observed variant frequencies of neighboring sites. The SHOREmap model does so by defining the concept of windows: each chromosome is divided in overlapping sliding windows of a user-defined length. A score is assigned to each window using the variant counts of all marker sites contained in the window. To obtain normalized scores for the different windows between \u22121 and 1, the raw score of each window is divided by the score of the window that displays the highest bias towards the variant from the superior parent. Normalized scores approximate 1 when the variant counts in the window display a bias towards the variant of the superior parent, \u22121 if the bias is towards the variant of the inferior parent and 0 if no bias towards either parent is observed. Spurious variant biases at marker sites located in windows not linked to a phenotype of interest are expected to get canceled out.",
                                "The statistical model applied by Swinnen et al., 2012a, on the other hand, deals with spurious biases in variant frequencies by fitting smoothing splines (a sufficiently smooth piecewise-polynomial function (Bartels et al., 1987)) to the input data. After smoothing, a binomial test is applied at each marker site with a correction for multiple testing.",
                                "To quantitatively assess the performance of the different methods, we defined as a true positive prediction any marker site that was predicted to be linked to the phenotype of interest by our method that was also located in or close to one of the two regions experimentally shown to be linked to high ethanol tolerance (QTL1, QTL3). We defined as close all regions located either 80 kb upstream or downstream of the causative gene, since scoring of selected, single marker sites in the individual segregants by PCR amplification (fine-mapping) revealed variant counts biasing towards the superior parent in the positively linked QTLs for this physical range (Swinnen et al., 2012a).",
                                "The number of true negatives is more difficult to estimate because only the two regions with most pronounced signals in the data were subjected to experimental validation. Since some other regions might also contain causative mutations and thus qualify as true positive QTLs, we cannot assume that all of the non-verified regions are false positives. To estimate the false positive rate we used a method described by Tusher et al., 2001. For a given set of parameter settings (see materials and methods) we ran each method on both the selected (tolerant to 16% ethanol) and the unselected pool. In the unselected pool, which can be considered as a randomized version of the selected pool, all predictions are by definition false positives. Hence, we can estimate the false positive rate as the number of predictions from the unselected pool (number of predictions that pass the chosen cut-off on the linkage score in the unselected pool) divided by the number of predictions in the selected pool (where both the predictions on the selected and unselected pools were obtained with the same parameter settings and cut-off settings). We assumed that we can estimate the number of falsely linked marker sites amongst the total number of predicted marker sites in the selected pool from the predictions made in the unselected pool, because both pools are similar in size. Results of this analysis were obtained with a range of different cut-off settings for each method (0.9 to 0.0, decrement step of 0.1). To allow for a fair comparison, we used for each method the parameters that resulted in the best performance on the positive set (see materials and methods, i.e., \u03b1P=10 for EXPLoRA; window size=250 kb and window step=10 kb for SHOREmap, a window size of 40 kb for the method of Swinnen et al., 2012a). The results show that the statistical model of Swinnen et al., 2012a, behaves quite conservative: it achieves a low false positive rate of predicting linked marker sites for the whole range of assayed cut-offs, but at the expense of a low sensitivity. On the other hand, SHOREmap reaches high sensitivities, but at the cost of a high false positive rate. Of all three tested methods, EXPLoRA yields the best compromise between sensitivity and false positive rate.",
                                "The observed differences amongst the three algorithms can also be deduced from the linkage score distributions along the genome that each method produces on the positive dataset (i.e., in the neighborhood of QTL1 and QTL3). EXPLoRA and the statistical model used in Swinnen et al., 2012a, both produce block-like signals that correspond well to the notion of linked \u201crecombination blocks.\u201d However, the statistical model of Swinnen et al., 2012a, produces a sharper signal than EXPLoRA with an almost binary behavior, explaining its lower sensitivity. The behavior of SHOREmap signals is less \u201cblock-like,\u201d but more peaked with a rather high base line explaining its higher false positive prediction rate. All three methods were able to prioritize the experimentally validated region on chromosome XIV (QTL3) at a relatively stringent setting. Prioritizing the region on chromosome V containing the gene URA3 (QTL1) seemed less trivial. In the case of SHOREmap, this required reducing the stringency on the cut-off of the linkage score to such extent (below 0.7) that the false positive rate at the level of the marker sites becomes larger than 0.4. With the cut-off on the linkage score used in the original paper (\u22670.9), the method used by Swinnen et al., 2012a, failed to detect QTL1. With EXPLoRA, we could reliably identify the region on QTL1 with the same stringent cut-off as we used for identifying QTL3 and thus with the same low false positive rate.",
                                "The beneficial effect of explicitly modeling the dependency between neighboring sites on the performance of the model is also illustrated by the results obtained with EXPLoRA when the values of the recombination parameter r are gradually increased. Indeed that when treating neighboring marker sites more independently by increasing r, the accuracy of the predictions drops (lower sensitivity with higher false positive rate, here evaluated again at the level of marker sites).",
                                "**Effect of Modeling the Dependency Between Neighboring Sites on the Analysis of Small Pools**",
                                "The beneficial effect of using the dependency between neighboring sites when analyzing the results of a BSA is expected to be more pronounced when the number of segregants is low. The reasons are that, on the one hand, the effect of linkage disequilibrium is more pronounced (less recombinations have occurred) and the \u201cblock-like behavior\u201d is truly present in the data. On the other hand, the higher power obtained through modeling the effects of linkage disequilibrium partly offsets the disadvantages of having fewer segregants (e.g., lower signal to noise ratio and loss of statistical power if linkage scores depend on the number of segregants). To simulate this situation of having less segregants, we sampled random subsets of 20, 40, 60 and 80% of the alignments coming from the segregant pool that was selected for high ethanol tolerance (16%). Since the total average sequencing coverage obtained in the original experiment was 55, much lower than the number of segregants in the pool (136), the sequence data reflects the sampling of maximally 55 different segregants, so that our experiments simulates the use of sequence data derived from maximally 11, 22, 33, and 44 segregants, respectively. We recalculated the allele counts for each marker and analyzed the data using EXPLoRA. Only when the sequencing coverage was drastically reduced to 20% of the original average coverage, the accuracy drops considerably (higher false positive rate for the same sensitivity).",

                                "Since EXPLoRA combines increased sensitivity with a low false positive rate, we tested whether using EXPLoRA allows the identification of additional sites linked to high ethanol tolerance that could not be identified with statistical certainty in the original analysis (Swinnen et al., 2012a). We selected 0.7 as cut-off on the posterior probability (linkage score) since at this cut-off our method approaches the same low false positive rate that was also used in the original analysis, but reaches a higher sensitivity. We ran EXPLoRA on the pools selected for 16 and 17% ethanol separately, assuming that signals that are only weakly supported in the 16% ethanol pool should be confirmed by the signals obtained from the (smaller) sub-pool of segregants that were tolerant to 17% ethanol. Using \u03b1P=10 and the cut-off on the linkage score of 0.7 allowed us to predict in the 16% pool 1 361 marker sites to be linked to higher ethanol tolerance, being located in 4 QTLs with an average size of 92 130 bp compared to predicting the linkage of 19 marker sites in an unselected pool being located in 4 small sized regions (on average 1 175 bp) (see Table 7). Analogously, analysis of the 17% pool allowed predicting linkage to the phenotype of 1 830 marker sites being located in 5 QTLs (regions with an average size of 148 310 bp) compared to predicting linkage of 25 marker sites in the unselected pool corresponding to 4 QTLs with an average size of only 1 250 bp. These numbers indicate that the QTLs predicted from the analysis of the selected pool almost surely are truly linked regions as no regions of similar size could be predicted to be linked in the unselected pool (estimated number of falsely predicted regions equals 0).",
                                "In addition to the previously identified loci (QTLs 1 and 3), we could distinguish in the pool selected for 16% ethanol, an additional significant QTL on chromosome X (referred to as QTL2). These three QTLs (QTL1-3) identified in the 16% pool were also detected in the analysis of the 17% ethanol pool using EXPLoRA, further increasing the confidence that these QTLs were truly linked to ethanol tolerance.",
                                "In addition to the QTLs detected in both the 16 and 17% ethanol tolerant pools, we identified with EXPLoRA two QTLs in the 17% ethanol pool, i.e., QTL4 located on chromosome XV and QTL5 located on chromosome II, none of which was described before (FIG. 10, panels D and F). Both QTLs appeared to be largely absent from the 16% ethanol tolerant pool (with the exception of a very small sized linked region identified in the 16% ethanol tolerant pool for QTL5, FIG. 10, panel E) and, therefore, seem to be specifically enriched during selection for very high ethanol tolerance.",
                                "For comparison, the original relative variant frequencies together with the linkage scores of, respectively, SHOREmap, the statistical model of Swinnen et al., 2012a, and EXPLoRA for these three additional loci (QTL2, QTL4 and QTL5) are shown in FIG. 10 for, respectively, the pool of 16% and 17% ethanol. Table 7 gives an estimation of the number of falsely linked marker sites and regions that were predicted at the maximal threshold needed to identify the indicated QTLs with each of the respective methods (see materials and methods). As described above, EXPLoRA detects these QTLs with a very low expected false positive rate at the level of the marker sites and a zero false positive rate at the level of the regions. On the other hand, for SHOREmap the expected number of falsely predicted marker sites/regions becomes prohibitive when using a cut-off on its linkage score that would allow prioritizing the same QTLs in the 16% and 17% pool that were reliably detected by EXPLoRA (see Table 7). For example, with a very low cut-off of 0.5, SHOREmap would detect in the 17% pool, 7 putative QTLs amongst which are QTL 3, 4 and 5 but with an expected false positive rate of 6 out of the 7 predicted regions. So, even after lowering the threshold on the linkage score drastically, SHOREmap can only reliably detect QTL3 in the pool selected for 17% ethanol tolerance. The figures also confirm that the method of Swinnen et al., 2012a, is conservative: after lowering the threshold considerably, it also succeeds in prioritizing QTL 4 and 5 with a low false positive detection rate (zero at the region level). However, because of its conservative character no single threshold exists that would allow detecting either QTL2 and QTL1 in the 17% pool as both regions have a zero linkage score with the statistical method of Swinnen et al., 2012a.",
                                "**Experimental Validation of the Newly Predicted QTL2 on Chromosome X**",
                                "To assess the validity of our predictions, we selected QTL2 (on chromosome X) for experimental validation as this QTL not only seemed to be of major importance for ethanol tolerance, but was also detected only by EXPLoRA (even after lowering the threshold on the linkage score for the other methods). Performing fine-mapping of the region by PCR-based scoring of the markers in the individual segregants (materials and methods), allowed us to confirm the area with the strongest link (approximated by a 53 kb region, according to our predictions on the pool tolerant to 16% ethanol and by a 8.3 kb region, according to our predictions on the pool tolerant to 17% ethanol (FIG. 10, panels A and B) (FIG. 11A), Mutations in this confirmed region (about 29 kb, encompassing 16 genes) were verified with Sanger sequencing. All genes carrying non-synonymous mutations in their coding region were selected as candidate causative genes (FIG. 11A). True causative genes in QTL2 were identified using reciprocal hemizygosity analysis (Steinmetz et al., 2002). For each candidate causative gene a set of two diploid strains was constructed by crossing the parental strains, either containing or lacking the candidate gene. As a result, each diploid has a different allele of the candidate gene while the other copy of the gene is deleted (FIG. 11B). Phenotypic analysis on YPD plates with 16% ethanol showed a clear difference in ethanol tolerance between the two diploid strains carrying a different allele of VPS70: the strain with the allele derived from the VR1-5B superior parent grew very well in the presence of 16% ethanol, whereas the strain with the allele from the BY4741 inferior parent did not grow at all (FIG. 11C), indicating that VPS70 carries a causative mutation responsible for the link of QTL2 with high ethanol tolerance. Except for a putative role in sorting of vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole (Bonangelino et al., 2002), no link with ethanol tolerance for VPS70 has been reported (e.g., in van Voorst et al., 2006).",

Ethanol tolerance was compared with tolerance to methanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and isobutanol. Growth was scored at each alcohol concentration based on the number of dilution spots in which growth was visible. For each strain the scores obtained at the different alcohol concentrations were counted together to obtain the cumulative growth score for that strain in the presence of the specified alcohol. The results are shown in FIG. 12. A linear correlation can be noticed between ethanol tolerance and tolerance for all the other alcohols tested."
