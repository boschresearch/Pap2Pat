    "abstract": "Intensity standardization of MRI data sets aims at correcting scanner-dependent intensity variations. An automatic technique, called STI, which shares the simplicity and robustness of histogram-matching techniques, but also incorporates tissue spatial intensity information, has been discovered. The method comprises registering a medical image to a standard image; applying one or more masks to the image medical and standard images for isolating certain specific image components; determining the most common intensity data pair between the medical and standard images for each isolated image component; calculating a formula that joins the most common intensity data pair of each image component; and interpolating an intensity data adjustment using the formula and applying it to the medical image data to generate a standardized version of the medical image.",

                        "Magnetic resonance images (MRI) acquired with similar protocols but on different scanners will show dissimilar intensity contrasts for the same tissue types. These variations are machine-dependant, and go beyond random or systematic errors that can be corrected with image de-noising that are known in the art or bias field heterogeneity estimation. This situation is particularly acute in large, multi-centric settings such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), in which data was acquired from 56 different centers in the United States and Canada. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60-million, 5-year public-private partnership. It collected data on more than 800 subjects for Alzheimer's neuroimaging research.",
                        "Automated image-processing pipelines must be robust to these variations, if they are to provide reliable and reproducible measurements that have clinical meaning. Thus, intensity standardization must be performed so that similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning in the standardized images, regardless of scanner origin, location, type or operator. Techniques exist to perform standardization, but they are essentially aimed at matching the image histogram (i.e. from the image to be standardized) onto a standard or reference image histogram In particular, the technique of Nyul et al. [Nyul, L. G., J. K. Udupa, and X. Zhang, New variants of a method of MRI scale standardization. IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 2000. 19(2): p. 143-50.] matches percentile histogram landmarks (PCT), linearly interpolating intensities between them. Applicant's experience dictated that histogram matching should not be considered the unique objective, as it may artificially distort image contrasts and therefore result in a loss of biological meaning, quite exactly the opposite effect sought after. In some cases, two different tissue types can have a similar intensity profiles and therefore provide inefficient intensity adjustment and/or intensity adjustments that are not adapted to the specific tissue type. Indeed, intensity values alone do not inherently carry information about the tissue being observed. Rather, standardization should be aimed at matching spatially corresponding tissue intensities to remove, as much as possible, scanner effects. FIG. 1 shows a flowchart of a prior art methods for standardization.",

The problem was then to define a measure that applicants could use to perform a quantitative comparison. Since applicants think that standardization should aim at matching corresponding tissue intensities, applicants needed measures that would evaluate both histogram matching and spatial intensity correspondence. Applicants thus performed a comparison based on the following four measures:\n\n\n- - 1. Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) with respect to standard.\n    Applicants used KLD to evaluate histogram matching. It measures the\n    difference between the histograms of the standardized and the\n    standard images. KLD does not depend on spatial correspondence.\n  - 2. Mean absolute error (MAE), with respect to standard, i.e. mean\n    absolute intensity difference between the standardized and the\n    standard images over the entire image volume. MAE depends on spatial\n    correspondence between the standard and the input images.\n  - 3. Normalized mutual information with respect to input (NMI) as\n    shown in Studholme et al. \\[Studholme, C., D. L. G. Hill, and D. J.\n    Hawkes, An overlap invariant entropy measure of 3D medical image\n    alignment. Pattern Recognition, 1999. 32(1): p. 71-86\\]. Although\n    NMI does not assess standardization performance, applicants used\n    that measure to evaluate how the standardization affects the input\n    image. As NMI decreases, information is lost in the standardization\n    process.\n  - 4. Joint-histogram diagonal sum with respect to standard (JHDS),\n    i.e. the sum of the diagonal bins of the joint histogram of standard\n    vs. standardized images. Applicants note that the bin size\n    corresponded to a 1% intensity variation. The rationale behind this\n    proposed measure is that the joint histogram of the standard vs.\n    input images should present higher frequencies on its diagonal after\n    standardization. Ideally, if the standardization was perfect, the\n    joint histogram would be concentrated on the diagonal only, mapping\n    each intensity value of the input image to the same value for the\n    standard image. JHDS depends on spatial correspondence between the\n    standard and the input images.",

Applicants also note that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) intensity was overestimated for all three images, especially in (B) and (C). For the three cases, STI gave the best results. In particular, applicants note that the CSF intensity was kept similar to the original image and background of the standard.",
                                "Quantitative results obtained for the three examples above followed the same trend as for the whole ADNI dataset. In Table 2, applicants show the mean and standard deviation of KLD, MAE, NMI and JHDS for the whole dataset. PCT-1 gave the best results for KLD and MAE, followed by PCT-10. STI showed better NMI and JHDS, matching applicant's visual, qualitative evaluation. Applicants also performed two-sample t-tests between standardization methods for each measure. Distributions were all significantly different (p-value <0.001), except for one case: between PCT-10 and PCT-1, JHDS distributions were not, with a p-value of 0.439.",
                                "According to the KLD measure, PCT-1 was better than STI, showing superior histogram matching. However, as shown qualitatively in FIG. 8, STI showed better spatially-distributed intensity matching. For MAE, STI showed the best scores overall with the E-ADNI dataset, but the worst with the ADNI dataset. Those results suggest that KLD and MAE measures, along with histogram-matching techniques, cannot be considered entirely appropriate.",
                                "In fact, one of applicants' main challenges was to determine which measure to use to assess standardization technique performances. One objective in finding such a measure would be to use an optimization method to find a better intensity mapping function.",
                                "While NMI suggested that more information from the input image was kept for STI than for PCT-1 or PCT-10 with the ADNI dataset, this measure cannot be used for that purpose since it compares the standardized image with the input image, not with the standard.",
                                "JHDS seemed to follow best applicants' qualitative evaluation by visual inspection. Those results lead the applicants to believe that it is a first step toward an appropriate performance measure.",
                                "Although a limitation of STI is that global linear registration is necessary, visual inspection showed that STI performed better than PCT-10 and PCT-1. With this new technique, applicants were able to successfully standardize intensities in two multi-centric datasets.",
                                "It will be understood that a \u201cmask\u201d of an image component allow to isolate specific areas of the image which can correspond to specific tissue types such as grey matter, white matter, CSF and background. It will be appreciated in FIG. 3 that the image components being masked are those in white. Any pixel/voxel not appearing in the mask is discarded and any pixel/voxel from the test image and standard image corresponding to the location of a pixel/voxel in the mask will be retained for further analysis such as generating joint histograms. In this case, applicants used brain masks obtained from the McGill Brain Imaging Center.",
                                "Registration is the process of identifying the transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, etc) that maximize the cross-correlation between characteristics from the standard and test images, estimated at each pixel/voxel position.",
                                "FIG. 4 schematically illustrates intensity adjustment of a medical image according to the present invention. A dot plot joint-histogram of medical image intensity (x axis) and standard image intensity (y axis) for each pixel/voxel is presented. Sample dot clouds for grey matter and white matter are provided. If two identical images were compared with this method, a line with a slope (m) of 1 and a y-intercept (b) of 0 would be obtained. In this example,\n\n\n- - if X is less than intensity 35, y=m1x+b1,\n  - if X is between 35 and 50, y=m2x+b2\n  - if X is greater than 50, y=m3x+b3  \n    where b is the y-intercept and m is the slope of the line (formula).",
                                "A specific linear formula of the type y=mx+b is used. The \u201cadjusted\u201d intensity (y value) for any medical image intensity (x value) depends on the value of X and its proximity to a tissue component. For example, if the intensity value of the pixel/voxel of the medical image to be standardized is 30, then the formula used will be y=m1x+b1. However, if the intensity value of the pixel/voxel of the medical image to be standardized is 60, then the formula used will be y=m3x+b3, and so on. It will be appreciated that the more image components in a medical image, the more formulas will be used to \u201cadjust\u201d the medical image intensity value. It will be understood by those skilled in the art the formula need not be a linear formula it could also be, for example, a polynomial formula. As discussed above, minimum and maximum data points were added. In this example, the presence of two image components would allow to generate only one linear formula that would not be efficient for low or high intensity values. By adding the minimum and maximum points, the \u201cadjustment\u201d to low and high values generates a more useful standardized image.",
                                "In cases where only 1 image component is used (i.e. one mask isolates one tissue type and all other tissues are discarded from the image), having the minimum and maximum allows to calculate 2 linear formulas. Without these added points, it would not be possible to provide an intensity adjustment factor.",
                                "FIG. 5 shows an example of an intensity histogram after standardization by the various methods indicated (PCT-10, PCT-1, STI) as well as one of the statistical measures (JHDS) used to determine standardization method effectiveness.",

In such an apparatus, a source of medical images and a source of standard images are required. An image pre-processor pre-processes the medical image to facilitate its registration by the registrator. Masking specific tissues with the component isolator is an essential part of the present invention. Once tissues are isolated, the highest frequency data pair is retained for each tissue and used in the intensity adjustment calculator which generates an \u201cadjustment factor\u201d to be applied to all pixels/voxels of the medical image as a function of their proximity to the high frequency data pair. Once adjusted or standardize, the image can be presented on a viewer or image data can be transmitted to another location/computer. It will be appreciated that most aspects of this diagram can be performed by a computer using software programmed to carry out the described method.",

In this setup, a subject is placed inside an MRI machine for generating an image of his brain. In this case the imaging is performed by radio frequency emitters/sensors that are placed inside the MRI machine. The RF sensors can send data to an image capture device for generating a viewable image of the brain. The image thereby generated must be pre-processed. After pre-processing, the image is ready to be registered with a standard image representing the same \u201cbrain volume\u201d obtained from an image database. After registration of the image to the standard image, masks are applied in order to isolate specific tissue types. These masks can also be obtained from a mask database.

Examples are presented in FIG. 12 for GM (a), WM (b) and CSF (c), respectively.
