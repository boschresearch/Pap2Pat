                                "Engineered cell therapies have enormous potential to address diseases that would be difficult or impossible to control with drugs alone. Once in a patient, the ability of engineered therapeutic cells to function correctly depends on their population density at different sites in the body. However, current cell therapies generally lack rationally designed systems that would enable engineered cells to control their own population density. There is a need for synthetic circuits that enable cells to sense, control, and respond to their own population size to provide this capability, allowing engineered cells to autonomously reach designed densities, or to activate therapeutic or safety programs at specific density thresholds. However, any circuit that limits growth can be susceptible to mutations that inactivate it. There is a need for circuits that can enable population control in a way that is robust to such mutations, and thus make such systems more stable and reliable."

Non-integrating vectors remain episomal which means the nucleic acid contained therein is never integrated into the host cell chromosomes. Examples of integrating vectors include retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, hybrid adenoviral vectors, and herpes simplex viral vector. One example of a non-integrative vector is a non-integrative viral vector. Non-integrative viral vectors eliminate the risks posed by integrative retroviruses, as they do not incorporate their genome into the host DNA. One example is the Epstein Barr oriP/Nuclear Antigen-1 (\u201cEBNA1\u201d) vector, which is capable of limited self-replication and known to function in mammalian cells. As containing two elements from Epstein-Barr virus, oriP and EBNA1, binding of the EBNA1 protein to the virus replicon region oriP maintains a relatively long-term episomal presence of plasmids in mammalian cells. This particular feature of the oriP/EBNA1 vector makes it ideal for generation of integration-free iPSCs. Another non-integrative viral vector is adenoviral vector and the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. Other non-integrative viral vectors contemplated herein are single-strand negative-sense RNA viral vectors, such Sendai viral vector and rabies viral vector. Another example of a non-integrative vector is a minicircle vector. Minicircle vectors are circularized vectors in which the plasmid backbone has been released leaving only the eukaryotic promoter and cDNA(s) that are to be expressed.

In some embodiments, the vector can also comprise regulatory control elements known to one of skill in the art to influence the expression of the RNA and/or protein products encoded by the polynucleotide within desired cells of the subject. In some embodiments, functionally, expression of the polynucleotide is at least in part controllable by the operably linked regulatory elements such that the element(s) modulates transcription of the polynucleotide, transport, processing and stability of the RNA encoded by the polynucleotide and, as appropriate, translation of the transcript. A specific example of an expression control element is a promoter, which is usually located 5\u2032 of the transcribed sequence. Another example of an expression control element is an enhancer, which can be located 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 of the transcribed sequence, or within the transcribed sequence. Another example of a regulatory element is a recognition sequence for a microRNA. Another example of a regulatory element is an ration and the splice donor and splice acceptor sequences that regulate the splicing of said intron.

                                "The payload protein(s) and/or target protein(s) can comprise a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T-cell receptor (TCR). In some embodiments, the CAR comprises a T-cell receptor (TCR) antigen binding domain. The term \u201cChimeric Antigen Receptor\u201d or alternatively a \u201cCAR\u201d refers to a set of polypeptides, typically two in the simplest embodiments, which when in an immune effector cell, provides the cell with specificity for a target cell, typically a cancer cell, and with intracellular signal generation. The terms \u201cCAR\u201d and \u201cCAR molecule\u201d are used interchangeably. In some embodiments, a CAR comprises at least an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain (also referred to herein as \u201can intracellular signaling domain\u201d) comprising a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule and/or costimulatory molecule as defined below. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides are in the same polypeptide chain (e.g., comprise a chimeric fusion protein). In some aspects, the set of polypeptides are contiguous with each other. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides are not contiguous with each other, e.g., are in different polypeptide chains. In some embodiments, the set of polypeptides include a dimerization switch that, upon the presence of a dimerization molecule, can couple the polypeptides to one another, e.g., can couple an antigen binding domain to an intracellular signaling domain. In one aspect, the stimulatory molecule is the zeta chain associated with the T cell receptor complex. In one aspect, the cytoplasmic signaling domain further comprises one or more functional signaling domains derived from at least one costimulatory molecule as defined below. In some embodiments, the costimulatory molecule is chosen from the costimulatory molecules described herein, e.g., 4-1BB (i.e., CD137), CD27 and/or CD28. In some embodiments, the CAR comprises a chimeric fusion protein comprising an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain comprising a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule. In some embodiments, the CAR comprises a chimeric fusion protein comprising an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain comprising a functional signaling domain derived from a costimulatory molecule and a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule. In some embodiments, the CAR comprises a chimeric fusion protein comprising an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain comprising two functional signaling domains derived from one or more costimulatory molecule(s) and a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule. In some embodiments, the CAR comprises a chimeric fusion protein comprising an extracellular antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular signaling domain comprising at least two functional signaling domains derived from one or more costimulatory molecule(s) and a functional signaling domain derived from a stimulatory molecule. In some embodiments the CAR comprises an optional leader sequence at the amino-terminus (N-ter) of the CAR fusion protein. In some embodiments, the CAR further comprises a leader sequence at the N-terminus of the extracellular antigen binding domain, wherein the leader sequence is optionally cleaved from the antigen binding domain (e.g., a scFv) during cellular processing and localization of the CAR to the cellular membrane.",
                                "The CAR and/or TCR can comprise one or more of an antigen binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling domain. The CAR or TCR further can comprise a leader peptide. The TCR further can comprise a constant region and/or CDR4. The term \u201csignaling domain\u201d refers to the functional portion of a protein which acts by transmitting information within the cell to regulate cellular activity via defined signaling pathways by generating second messengers or functioning as effectors by responding to such messengers. An \u201cintracellular signaling domain,\u201d as the term is used herein, refers to an intracellular portion of a molecule. The intracellular signaling domain generates a signal that promotes an immune effector function of the CAR containing cell, e.g., a CART cell. Examples of immune effector function, e.g., in a CART cell, include cytolytic activity and helper activity, including the secretion of cytokines. In an embodiment, the intracellular signaling domain can comprise a primary intracellular signaling domain. Exemplary primary intracellular signaling domains include those derived from the molecules responsible for primary stimulation, or antigen dependent simulation. In an embodiment, the intracellular signaling domain can comprise a costimulatory intracellular domain. Exemplary costimulatory intracellular signaling domains include those derived from molecules responsible for costimulatory signals, or antigen independent stimulation. For example, in the case of a CART, a primary intracellular signaling domain can comprise a cytoplasmic sequence of a T cell receptor, and a costimulatory intracellular signaling domain can comprise cytoplasmic sequence from co-receptor or costimulatory molecule. A primary intracellular signaling domain can comprise a signaling motif which is known as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif or ITAM. Examples of ITAM containing primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences include, but are not limited to, those derived from CD3 zeta, common FcR gamma (FCER1G), Fc gamma RIIa, FcR beta (Fc Epsilon Rib), CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD79a, CD79b, DAP10, and DAP12.",

The cytoplasmic domain or region of the CAR includes an intracellular signaling domain. An intracellular signaling domain is generally responsible for activation of at least one of the normal effector functions of the immune cell in which the CAR has been introduced. The term \u201ceffector function\u201d refers to a specialized function of a cell. Effector function of a T cell, for example, may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term \u201cintracellular signaling domain\u201d refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling domain can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain. To the extent that a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain is used, such truncated portion may be used in place of the intact chain as long as it transduces the effector function signal. The term intracellular signaling domain is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain sufficient to transduce the effector function signal.",
                                "The term \u201ccostimulatory molecule\u201d refers to a cognate binding partner on a T cell that specifically binds with a costimulatory ligand, thereby mediating a costimulatory response by the T cell, such as, but not limited to, proliferation. Costimulatory molecules are cell surface molecules other than antigen receptors or their ligands that are contribute to an efficient immune response. Costimulatory molecules include, but are not limited to an MHC class I molecule, BTLA and a Toll ligand receptor, as well as OX40, CD27, CD28, CD5, ICAM-1, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), ICOS (CD278), and 4-1BB (CD137).

A costimulatory intracellular signaling domain can be the intracellular portion of a costimulatory molecule. A costimulatory molecule can be represented in the following protein families: TNF receptor proteins, Immunoglobulin-like proteins, cytokine receptors, integrins, signaling lymphocytic activation molecules (SLAM proteins), and activating NK cell receptors. The intracellular signaling domain can comprise the entire intracellular portion, or the entire native intracellular signaling domain, of the molecule from which it is derived, or a functional fragment or derivative thereof.",

It is known that signals generated through the TCR alone are insufficient for full activation of the T cell and that a secondary and/or costimulatory signal is also required. Thus, T cell activation can be said to be mediated by two distinct classes of cytoplasmic signaling sequences: those that initiate antigen-dependent primary activation through the TCR (primary intracellular signaling domains) and those that act in an antigen-independent manner to provide a secondary or costimulatory signal (secondary cytoplasmic domain, e.g., a costimulatory domain). A primary signaling domain regulates primary activation of the TCR complex either in a stimulatory way, or in an inhibitory way. Primary intracellular signaling domains that act in a stimulatory manner may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs or ITAMs. The primary signaling domain can comprise a functional signaling domain of one or more proteins selected from the group consisting of CD3 zeta, CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, common FcR gamma (FCER1G), FcR beta (Fc Epsilon Rib), CD79a, CD79b, Fcgamma RIIa, DAP10, and DAP12, or a functional variant thereof.",

In some embodiments, a tumor antigen is a marker expressed by both normal cells and cancer cells, e.g., a lineage marker, e.g., CD19 on B cells. In some embodiments, a tumor antigen is a cell surface molecule that is overexpressed in a cancer cell in comparison to a normal cell, for instance, 1-fold over expression, 2-fold overexpression, 3-fold overexpression or more in comparison to a normal cell. In some embodiments, a tumor antigen is a cell surface molecule that is inappropriately synthesized in the cancer cell, for instance, a molecule that contains deletions, additions or mutations in comparison to the molecule expressed on a normal cell. In some embodiments, a tumor antigen will be expressed exclusively on the cell surface of a cancer cell, entirely or as a fragment (e.g., MHC/peptide), and not synthesized or expressed on the surface of a normal cell. In some embodiments, the CARs of the present invention includes CARs comprising an antigen binding domain (e.g., antibody or antibody fragment) that binds to a MHC presented peptide. Normally, peptides derived from endogenous proteins fill the pockets of Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, and are recognized by T cell receptors (TCRs) on CD8+T lymphocytes. The MHC class I complexes are constitutively expressed by all nucleated cells. In cancer, virus-specific and/or tumor-specific peptide/MHC complexes represent a unique class of cell surface targets for immunotherapy.

                                "The antigen binding domain can be connected to the transmembrane domain by a hinge region. In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be attached to the extracellular region of the CAR, e.g., the antigen binding domain of the CAR, via a hinge, e.g., a hinge from a human protein. For example, in one embodiment, the hinge can be a human Ig (immunoglobulin) hinge (e.g., an IgG4 hinge, an IgD hinge), a GS linker (e.g., a GS linker described herein), a KIR2DS2 hinge or a CD8a hinge.",
                                "With respect to the transmembrane domain, in various embodiments, a CAR can be designed to comprise a transmembrane domain that is attached to the extracellular domain of the CAR. A transmembrane domain can include one or more additional amino acids adjacent to the transmembrane region, e.g., one or more amino acid associated with the extracellular region of the protein from which the transmembrane was derived (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to 15 amino acids of the extracellular region) and/or one or more additional amino acids associated with the intracellular region of the protein from which the transmembrane protein is derived (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 up to 15 amino acids of the intracellular region). In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is one that is associated with one of the other domains of the CAR e.g., in one embodiment, the transmembrane domain may be from the same protein that the signaling domain, costimulatory domain or the hinge domain is derived from. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is not derived from the same protein that any other domain of the CAR is derived from. In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be selected or modified by amino acid substitution to avoid binding of such domains to the transmembrane domains of the same or different surface membrane proteins, e.g., to minimize interactions with other members of the receptor complex. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is capable of homodimerization with another CAR on the cell surface of a CAR-expressing cell. In a different aspect, the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain may be modified or substituted so as to minimize interactions with the binding domains of the native binding partner present in the same CAR-expressing cell.",

An \u201cautoimmune disease\u201d refers to a disease arising from an inappropriate immune response of the body of a subject against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In other words, the immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its own cells. This may be restricted to certain organs (e.g., in autoimmune thyroiditis) or involve a particular tissue in different places (e.g., Goodpasture's disease which may affect the basement membrane in both the lung and kidney). The treatment of autoimmune diseases is typically with immunosuppression, e.g., medications which decrease the immune response. Exemplary autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, necrotizing vasculitis, lymphadenitis, peri-arteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, scleroderma, pemphigus vulgaris, ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis), uveitis, Sjogren's syndrome, Crohn's disease, Reiter's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and cardiomyopathy.",

                                "In multicellular organisms, cells actively sense and control their own population density. Synthetic mammalian quorum sensing circuits could provide insight into principles of population control and improve cell therapies. However, a key challenge is avoiding their inherent sensitivity to \u201ccheater\u201d mutations that evade control. Here, the plant hormone auxin was repurposed to enable orthogonal mammalian cell-cell communication and quorum sensing. A paradoxical population control circuit was designed, termed Paradaux, in which auxin stimulates and inhibits net cell growth at different concentrations. This circuit was robust to cheater mutations, controlling growth for at least 43 days of continuous culture. By contrast, when operating in a non-paradoxical regime, the same cells limited population growth but were susceptible to mutational escape. These results establish auxin as a versatile \u2018private\u2019 communication system, and demonstrate that paradoxical circuit architectures can provide robust population control.",
                                "**Introduction**",
                                "Cells use intercellular communication systems to sense and control their own cell population density. In microbial communities, cells secrete diffusive signals to coordinate cooperative behaviors through the process of quorum sensing. In multicellular organisms, intercellular communication is essential to enable precise developmental patterning, control immunological responses, and coordinate organism-level physiology. Synthetic intercellular communication systems could similarly allow engineering of inherently multicellular behaviors not possible with cell-autonomous circuits.",
                                "In mammalian cells, an orthogonal, or \u201cprivate\u201d communication channel that allows specific communication between cells could enable engineering of analogous circuits (FIG. 1A). Mammalian cells have been engineered to produce, sense, and process signals from natural ligands by rewiring signaling pathways such as Nodal-Lefty, Sonic Hedgehog, and Notch, and by repurposing the amino acid tryptophan as a signaling molecule. However, these approaches are not orthogonal to endogenous systems. On the other hand, synthetic synNotch receptors allow multiple orthogonal communication channels, but depend on cell contact interactions to mediate diffusible signaling.",
                                "The ideal private communication system for mammalian population control would use a diffusible signal, avoid undesired interactions with non-engineered cells, permit external control over the strength of signaling, and operate in a broad variety of cell types. It should also allow direct, and rapid, control of diverse target protein activities to allow flexible interfacing within cells, and exhibit minimal immunogenicity to facilitate potential biomedical applications. Auxins, a class of plant-specific hormones that coordinate growth and behavior, including root initiation, embryogenesis, and tropism, represent an excellent candidate for this role. Molecularly, auxin induces protein-protein interactions between the F-box transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) protein and its target proteins. This leads to the assembly of a Skp, Cullin, F-box containing (SCF) complex, which in turn recruits E2 ubiquitin ligases that target specific proteins for degradation. Because TIR1 and its targets are absent in mammals, auxin does not regulate endogenous mammalian proteins. However, ectopic expression of TIR1 from rice (osTIR1) is sufficient to confer auxin-dependent degradation of proteins engineered to contain a minimal auxin inducible degron (mAID, or AID for simplicity in this paper). Thus, auxin is orthogonal to endogenous mammalian pathways but can enable direct control of key cellular activities through engineered protein targets. Additionally, in yeast, ectopic expression of bacterial indole-3-acetic acid hydrolase was shown to catalyze auxin production from an inactive precursor indole-3-acetamide (IAM), allowing controlled production of auxin. Nevertheless, a full auxin sending and receiving signaling system, which is necessary for population control, has not been established in mammalian cells.",
                                "A critical challenge for any population control circuit is evolutionary robustness. By limiting growth, a population control circuit inherently selects for \u2018cheater\u2019 mutations that escape regulation. In bacteria, toxin-antitoxin systems and periodic strain replacement can prevent cheater escape. However, these systems use components that do not function in mammalian cells or are not cell autonomous. In the mammalian context, a paradoxical architecture, in which a single signal stimulates both proliferation and death of the same target cell population, can actively select against cheaters. In this paradoxical design, mutations that diminish signal sensing lead to cell death and are eliminated. Despite its power and elegance, the paradoxical architecture has not, to our knowledge, been demonstrated synthetically in living cells.",
                                "The auxin pathway was engineered to act as a private mammalian communication channel, and it was used to construct and analyze synthetic population control circuits with different architectures. Combining auxin-synthesizing enzymes and auxin transporters, and employing alternative auxin precursors, it was shown that the auxin pathway can be used for synthetic quorum sensing in mammalian cells. Using this pathway, negative feedback and paradoxical control systems that regulate their own population size through auxin quorum sensing were constructed and compared. While both circuits limit population size, the paradoxical system enhances evolutionary stability, as predicted theoretically. Together, these results provide a versatile, diffusible synthetic signaling module for private-channel communication and demonstrate how paradoxical control schemes can enhance the evolutionary stability of population control systems.",

                                "To establish and characterize auxin regulation of mammalian cell growth, auxin sensing was coupled to drug resistance and fluorescence. Specifically, blasticidin S deaminase (BlastR), whose protein product is necessary for survival in the presence of blasticidin, was fused to AID and mCherry domains, allowing auxin-dependent degradation and fluorescent readout of protein concentration, respectively. This chimeric gene was then stably integrated, along with a constitutively co-expressed osTIR1, in CHO-K1 cells to create an auxin-sensitive \u201cReceiver\u201d cell line (FIG. 1B).",
                                "To validate auxin regulation of mCherry-AID-BlastR, Receivers were cultured in media containing varying concentrations of two auxin variants: either the major natural auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or a synthetic auxin analog, 1-napthalenatic acid (NAA) (FIG. 1C). Both auxins reduced mCherry fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner, with EC50 values of 0.11 \u03bcM and 0.76 \u03bcM, respectively. Addition of IAA to media containing blasticidin was sufficient to degrade BlastR and inhibit cell survival (FIG. 1D). This effect was dose-dependent with both blasticidin and IAA. Comparing fluorescence of mCherry-AID-BlastR in FIG. 1C with cell survival in FIG. 1D shows that a small amount of mCherry-AID-BlastR is sufficient to enable survival in blasticidin. These results confirmed that the AID domain and osTIR1 together are sufficient to enable net growth regulation by auxin in mammalian cells.",
                                "In addition to sensing, a population control system can require that cells produce auxin at levels sufficient to trigger responses in receiving cells. Auxin can be synthesized in two enzymatic steps: (1) oxidation of L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide (IAM) and (2) hydrolysis of IAM to IAA (FIG. 6B). By itself, the second enzymatic step can produce either IAA or NAA from precursors IAM or 1-naphthaleneacetamide (NAM), respectively, enabling direct control of auxin production (FIG. 2A). To identify enzymes that efficiently catalyze this reaction, thirteen indole-3-acetamide hydrolases from bacteria and plants (FIG. 6A, left) were compared by transiently expressing them individually in Receivers and measuring their ability to downregulate AID-tagged mCherry fluorescence by flow cytometry.",
                                "Three enzymes reduced mCherry to levels comparable to that produced by addition of IAA itself (FIG. 6A). Among these, A. tumefaciens iaaH was selected for further use. This was stably integrated in Receivers to create a Sender-Receiver cell line (FIG. 2B). After 2 days of culturing Sender-Receivers in media containing the IAM precursor, the resulting conditioned media, diluted into an equal volume of fresh media for optimum cell growth, reduced mCherry-AID-BlastR to levels comparable to those generated by saturating concentrations of IAA (FIGS. 2C and 2D). The Sender-Receiver line was also able to produce the auxin NAA (which, as shown below, has some advantages compared to IAA) from its corresponding precursor NAM (FIG. 2D), albeit with a diminished response compared to NAA, consistent with the higher EC50 of NAA compared to IAA. These results show that iaaH expression in mammalian cells can efficiently produce both auxins from corresponding precursors.",
                                "The ability to synthesize auxin in mammalian cells without exogenous precursors could facilitate in vivo applications of population control circuits. Bacterial auxin synthesis pathways use a tryptophan 2-monooxygenase, iaaM (also known as aux1 or TMO) to synthesize IAM from L-tryptophan (FIG. 6B). Sender-Receivers expressing iaaM, cultured in media without precursors, produced auxin concentrations in conditioned media that were sufficient to degrade the auxin reporter in Receiver cells (FIG. 6C). Furthermore, iaaM-expressing Receivers produced precursor in conditioned media, allowing auxin production by Sender-Receivers (FIG. 6C). These results demonstrate the two step iaaM-iaaH auxin synthesis pathway can operate in mammalian cells without exogenous precursors. However, in the following experiments, iaaH was used with added precursors to allow external control of auxin synthesis.",
                                "Population control can require integrating cell density over an extended spatial scale. To estimate the spatial range of auxin signaling, a field of Sender-Receivers was seeded adjacent to a larger region of Receivers, applying media in a 1.5% agarose gel to prevent non-diffusive transport (Methods). After 48 hours, mCherry fluorescence was reduced in Receivers proximal to the Sender-Receiver region, forming a long-range gradient. This effect occurred in the presence, but not the absence, of the IAM precursor, consistent with a dependence on IAA production (FIG. 2E, bottom). Image analysis revealed auxin response in Receivers declining to half its maximum value at a length scale of 15.6\u00b10.85 millimeters (Methods), or approximately 750 cell diameters, from the source region, within 48 hours (FIG. 2E, top), consistent with expectations for a small molecule the size of auxin diffusing in buffered solutions (FIG. 6D and supplementary text). These results show that auxin can provide information about global cell density over an extended region, and further demonstrate the possibility of using auxin as a synthetic gradient-forming morphogen for applications in synthetic developmental biology.",

                                "It was next asked whether Sender-Receiver cells could sense their own population density by producing auxin at a rate proportional to population size and sensing auxin concentration in the local environment (quorum sensing, FIG. 1A, middle panel). The dependence of reporter expression on cell population density in the presence of concentrations of each precursor sufficient to generate saturating levels of auxin was analyzed. With the NAM precursor, reporter fluorescence decreased in response to increasing population density (FIG. 3A, darker blue line). By contrast, addition of IAM generated a strong, but density-independent, decrease in fluorescence (FIG. 3A, light blue line). It was reasoned that this density-independence could result from IAA's limited membrane permeability at neutral pH, potentially causing newly synthesized IAA to accumulate intracellularly. Though the rate of exchange is sufficient to fully induce receiver cells (on the timescale of days, FIGS. 2D and 2E), it could be insufficient to prevent intracellular accumulation of auxin due to the faster rate of auxin production by iaaH (typically several \u03bcM per minute) in the same cell. To overcome this issue, the auxin exporter PIN2 from Arabidopsis thaliana was stably expressed in Sender-Receiver cells (Sender-Receiver-PIN2 cells) (FIG. 3B, right). PIN2 expression produced a modest decrease in auxin sensing, suggesting the transporter was functional (FIG. 7A), but allowed quorum sensing across most of the full dynamic range of auxin concentration sensing (FIG. 3B; FIG. 7B). Cells responded similarly to cell density across different culture media volumes, indicating quorum sensing responded to cell density rather than absolute cell number (FIG. 3C). Together, these results establish that Sender-Receiver cells can sense their own population density in two ways: using NAM without PIN or using either precursor with PIN2.",

To test this possibility, cells were seeded at different densities in media containing blasticidin, to make cell growth dependent on BlastR levels, as well as the precursor IAM. After 4 days, cells seeded at high, but not low, densities exhibited reduced cell numbers compared to cells plated at the same density without IAM or IAA (FIG. 3D). These results demonstrate density-dependent control of cell survival.",
                                "This negative autoregulatory feedback loop resembles a similar design in bacterial systems, where a quorum sensing signal induces cell killing. As with the bacterial circuit, this negative feedback circuit is inherently susceptible to \u2018cheater\u2019 mutations that allow cells to escape control. In fact, when the Sender-Receiver-PIN2 cell line was cultured in media containing blasticidin and IAM to activate the circuit, escape from population control was observed within 16 days (FIG. 7C) due to \u201ccheater\u201d cells that acquired the ability to proliferate in high auxin and blasticidin (FIG. 7D).",

In the paradoxical circuits, positive net growth can occur only at signal concentrations lying between two non-zero bounds, similar to the Allee effect in ecology (FIG. 4A, blue regions). By comparison, the simpler, non-paradoxical negative feedback architecture, in which signals only down-regulate growth, exhibits positive net growth at all signal concentrations below a single upper bound (FIG. 4A, lower left). While both circuits exhibit stable fixed points at the maximum of their positive growth zones, they respond differently to cheater mutations that reduce auxin sensitivity (the predominant cheater phenotype observed in FIGS. 7B and 7C). Specifically, with negative feedback alone, such cheater mutations extend the regime of positive net growth to higher signal concentrations and cell densities, providing a growth advantage over non-mutant cells (FIG. 4A, lower right). By contrast, in the paradoxical circuit, the same mutation would cause signal sensing to drop below the lower bound, activating the cell death arm of the circuit (FIG. 4A upper right). In this way, the paradoxical circuit design should suppress escape by cheater mutations that reduce or eliminate signal sensing.",
                                "A paradoxical circuit was designed in which auxin represses both proliferation and death, a configuration that is well-suited to the inhibitory nature of auxin-dependent protein degradation (FIG. 4A, upper left). In addition to auxin regulation of BlastR a parallel regulatory pathway was added, in which auxin negatively regulates cell death by inducing degradation of iCasp9, an ectopically expressed master regulator of apoptosis (caspase 9) activated by the small molecular dimerizer AP1903 (FIG. 4B). An AID domain in iCasp9 was added to provide auxin regulation, and fused it to the monomeric GFP variant mGFPmut3, to allow direct readout of its concentration (FIG. 4B). This design allows one to operate the same cell line in three regimes, depending on what combinations of blasticidin and AP1903 are added to the medium. With only blasticidin, the circuit operates in the pure negative feedback regime; with blasticidin and AP1903 it operates in the paradoxical regime; and with neither inducer it has unregulated growth. Because it implements paradoxical regulation through auxin, and this circuit was termed \u2018Paradaux.\u2019",

To eliminate one potential mechanism for evolutionary escape, BlastR was positioned at the C-terminal end of the construct, so that premature stop codon mutations would deactivate BlastR, decreasing survival. The construct was integrated to create stable monoclonal CHO-K1 cell lines for further analysis. Survival of these cells increased monotonically with auxin in the presence of AP1903 and decreased with auxin in the presence of blasticidin, demonstrating that both branches of the Paradaux circuit were individually functional (FIG. 4D, red and green lines). (An additional monoclonal line with an independent integration of the same circuit is shown in FIG. 8A). Further, including both blasticidin and AP1903 produced a biphasic survival curve (FIG. 4D, blue), which can, in some embodiments, be the key requirement for paradoxical population control.",

Remaining parameters were fit using the auxin-dependent survival rates measured with either AP1903 or blasticidin (FIG. 4D, red and green line). The model initially overestimated actual growth rates when both arms of the circuit were simultaneously active (FIG. 4D, dashed blue lines), possibly due to previously reported synergy between apoptosis and blasticidin-dependent translational inhibition. A phenomenological synergistic interaction term was therefore added to the growth rate expression (Equation S17 and Supplementary text; Table 2, parameter set 1; FIG. 4D, dotted line). Finally, it was checked that experimental parameter values expected to be independent of integration site, such as maximum cell death and growth rates, as well as synergy and Hill coefficients, agreed, within \u02dc2-fold, with those measured for a second Paradaux monoclonal cell line with an independent integration of the circuit construct (FIG. 8A; Table 2, parameter set 2).",
                                "Before initiating challenging long-term analysis of population control, the model was used to systematically scan for AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations likely to favor paradoxical population control. For each pair of AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations, the dependence of cell survival on auxin was classified into one of five qualitatively distinct behaviors: (1) positive net cell growth across all auxin concentrations (FIG. 4E, purple background); (2) negative net cell growth across all auxin concentrations (FIG. 4E, green background); (3) permissive growth, in which cells proliferate only beyond a minimum auxin concentration (FIG. 4E, pink background); (4) simple negative feedback control, analogous to the Sender-Receiver behavior (FIG. 4E, yellow background); and (5) paradoxical control (FIG. 4E, blue background). Only the negative and paradoxical feedback regimes produce a non-zero, stable fixed point, allowing population control. The desired paradoxical regime occurred in a window of blasticidin and AP1903 concentrations centered around 50 \u03bcg/ml and 50 nM, respectively (FIG. 4E). Further, this paradoxical window could be enlarged by optimizing the expression levels of iCasp9 and BlastR (FIG. 4F). Within the paradoxical regime, the circuit produced the expected bistability of population size (FIG. 8E) and robustness to mutations that eliminate auxin sensing, which were implemented by setting sensed auxin to 0 (FIG. 4G).",
                                "Additionally, the effect of the 2-3 day time delay required for blasticidin to kill sensitive cells was explored. Time delays in negative feedback loops are known to produce oscillations under some conditions. In simulations of the paradoxical circuit, inclusion of a time delay led to oscillations of population density with periods of 2 weeks or more, depending on the value of the delay parameter, \u03c4. A bifurcation between damped and sustained oscillations occurred at approximately \u03c4=48 hrs. Taken together, these results provided insight into parameter dependence and expected dynamics of the circuit, and identified specific AP1903 and blasticidin concentrations for long timescale analysis of the experimental circuit.",

                                "To experimentally analyze population control, cultures of the Paradaux cell line were continuously monitored for 43 days (an arbitrary time scale constrained by technical limitations). Cells were cultured in regimes of uncontrolled growth (no blasticin or AP1903), negative feedback (blasticidin added), or paradoxical feedback (both blasticidin and AP1903). In the uncontrolled regime, cells grew to, and remained at, full confluence for the duration of the movie (FIGS. 5A and 5B). In the latter two regimes, population dynamics exhibited oscillations, consistent with models incorporating time delays for blasticidin-dependent cell killing (FIG. 8F). Time-lapse imaging from FIG. 5A revealed robustness of the paradoxical population control architecture. In a time-course movie experiment, 10,000 cells were seeded per well into a 24-well imaging plate (FIG. 5A), with no control (100 \u03bcM NAM; left), negative feedback (100 \u03bcM NAM and 50 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin; middle), or paradoxical feedback (100 \u03bcM NAM, 50 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin, and 50 nM AP1903; right). Images of constitutively expressed mTagBFP2 were taken with a 20\u00d7 inverted microscope every 4 hours, in a 5\u00d75 grid, and stitched together (Methods). Robustness of the paradoxical population control architecture was observed.",
                                "The negative feedback regime limited population size for 1 or 2 oscillatory periods (\u02dc15-20 days), after which cells appeared to escape control, remaining confluent for the remainder of the movie (at least 10 subsequent days, FIG. 5B). This behavior is consistent with the experimentally observed susceptibility of simple negative feedback control to escape mutants (FIGS. 7C and 7D), and simulated responses to introduction of sensing mutants (FIG. 4G). By contrast, in the paradoxical regime, cultures exhibited oscillations in population density, but remained at sub-saturating densities for the full 43-day experiment (FIG. 5B, bottom). Similar results were observed in an independent experiment that used different starting population densities and a slightly different cell maintenance protocol (FIG. 10; Methods). In this case as well, the negative feedback conditions led to escape, while the paradoxical conditions did not (FIG. 9A). Independent cultures showed identical dynamics for their first \u02dc10 days when shifted in time in time to compensate for their different initial seeding densities (FIG. 9B), suggesting that the circuit behaves consistently between cultures before acquiring random mutations. Across all experiments, only paradoxical feedback isolates successfully controlled population size for the full duration of the time-lapse movies (FIG. 5B and FIG. 9A), and only one of the paradoxical isolates approached confluence at the movie end-point of 43 days (FIG. 9A, turquoise arrow). Together, these results demonstrate that the paradoxical control circuit reproducibly extends the duration of population control.",

The fluorescence of mCherry and mGFP, which are co-expressed with the BlastR and iCasp9, respectively, varied substantially across all isolates, reflecting independently acquired changes in the expression of circuit components during long-term culture, rather than amplification of a common founder mutation already present in the parental cell line (FIG. 5C). The two fluorescent reporters expressed at a similar ratio in each isolate (FIG. 5C), suggesting that alterations occurred upstream of both circuit arms.",
                                "The two population control conditions produced different effects on circuit component expression and phenotypic behavior. In cells selected under negative feedback conditions, basal BlastR expression was upregulated by 57%, and showed 49% less responsiveness to auxin compared to the uncontrolled group (FIGS. 5D and 5E; p=0.014 and p<0.001, respectively). By contrast, isolates from the paradoxical feedback conditions showed significantly lower basal BlastR expression (p=0.012) and retained a larger dynamic range of BlastR regulation compared to negative feedback isolates (p=0.011). These differences in BlastR levels were also reflected in cell survival (FIGS. 5F and 5G). In a combination of blasticidin and auxin, mimicking high cell density, negative feedback isolates exhibited increased survival compared to the uncontrolled group (p=0.021) (FIG. 5F). By contrast, survival of paradoxical isolates was not significantly different on average from the uncontrolled growth isolates (p=0.17), although one individual isolate may have acquired the ability to escape in these conditions (FIG. 9A and FIG. 5F, turquoise arrows). Together, these results suggest that paradoxical conditions preserved more of the original BlastR regulation and function compared to negative feedback conditions.",
                                "The paradoxical architecture is designed to suppress sensing deficient mutations that reduce the responsiveness of both arms of the circuit to auxin. More specifically, cells that lose auxin sensing should no longer degrade BlastR (FIG. 5H, lower right), even in the presence of auxin, giving those cells a growth advantage. By contrast, in the paradoxical circuit, such sensing deficient cells would also be unable to degrade iCasp9, leading to their elimination (FIG. 5H, upper right). Thus, sensing deficient isolates from the negative feedback condition should become susceptible to killing through the iCasp9 arm, even in the presence of auxin. In fact, isolates from negative feedback conditions were sensitive to the combination of AP1903 and auxin, indicating that they had acquired the potential to be counter-selected under paradoxical conditions (FIG. 5G, p=0.021). Together, these results suggest that cells with reduced sensing gain a growth advantage in negative feedback conditions but are counter-selected under paradoxical conditions, consistent with the principle of paradoxical control.",
                                "Finally, to characterize gene expression changes outside of the circuit during long-term culture, RNA sequencing analysis of the isolates was performed. RNA profiles generally clustered by circuit operating mode (uncontrolled, negative, or paradoxical feedback), although one paradoxical isolate exhibited an intermediate expression phenotype suggesting that the operating mode of the circuit largely drives gene expression changes (FIG. 10A). Isolates from the uncontrolled growth groups clustered with parental cells, suggesting that the uncontrolled conditions did not drive similar adaptations in gene expression. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ribosome components, the primary targets of blasticidin, were significantly upregulated in both negative feedback and paradoxical conditions (FIG. 10B). Differentially expressed proteasome components, on the other hand, were enriched in the negative feedback, but not in the paradoxical condition, and were expressed at lower levels in paradoxical compared to negative feedback conditions (FIG. 10C, nominal p=0.042, FDR q=0.085 and normalized enrichment score=\u22121.42), consistent with the opposite selection pressures on proteasome activity generated by auxin regulation of BlastR and iCasp9 in the paradoxical condition.",
                                "Together, these results suggest that diminished sensitivity to auxin provides a growth advantage in the negative feedback condition by upregulating and reducing the auxin-responsiveness of BlastR, but are counter-selected in the paradoxical condition, in which they would trigger activation of iCasp9. While this analysis cannot rule out the possibility that other adaptations could eventually lead to escape in paradoxical conditions, it suggests that the paradoxical design can extend the duration of population control by suppressing the growth advantage of sensing deficient mutants.",

                                "To better understand circuit dynamics and stability over longer timescales, time-lapse imaging of a continuous culture of Sender-Receiver-PIN2 cells was set up (FIG. 11A). Media was partially replaced twice daily to achieve a dilution rate of 50% per 24 hours, and acquired images of cells once per hour for 17 days (408 hours) (FIG. 11B). In the presence of precursor (IAM), cells grew to threshold (peak) densities, diminished due to cell death, and subsequently grew back. Further, the threshold densities that triggered cell death depended on blasticidin concentration but were independent of initial seeding density, consistent with quorum sensing (FIGS. 11C-11D; FIGS. 14A-14B). By contrast, in the absence of precursor, cells grew to and remained at a higher cell density. These results are broadly consistent with the pulsatile \u2018overshoot\u2019 dynamics expected from time-delayed negative feedback.",
                                "Although the circuit initially limited growth, at longer times, population sizes invariably reached those of cultures lacking blasticidin (FIG. 11C; FIGS. 14A-14B). This behavior could reflect not only pulses in population density but also the appearance and expansion of \u2018cheater\u2019 mutations that effectively disable population control over longer timescales. In fact, cells extracted at the endpoints of movies conducted with blasticidin were significantly less responsive to auxin compared parental or unregulated group (p<0.01 for each culture), and therefore more resistant to blasticidin than cells cultured in the absence of IAM, i.e. without activation of the circuit (FIG. 11E; FIG. 14C). These results suggest that cells acquired mutations (or other heritable changes) that effectively reduced auxin sensing.",
                                "Several observations suggest that these effects originated from spontaneous, independent mutations. First, resistance mutations occurred in separately maintained, long-term cultures, and therefore could not spread from one culture to another. Second, parental cells cultured in the presence of IAA and blasticidin died within 3 days, with no cells observed to escape selection for at least 20 days of further observation (FIG. 14D), indicating that adaptive mutants were not present in the parental population. Finally, sequencing of the integrated osTIR1/BlastR-AID-mCherry plasmid in ten escape mutant lines revealed three distinct, non-synonymous mutations within the AID sequence, consistent with a loss of auxin sensing. While sensing mutations are likely responsible at least in part for the mutant growth advantage, their specific effects in a parental background was not characterized. Together, these results suggest that the negative feedback population control circuit can be circumvented by de novo mutations or other heritable changes in the circuit. However, as described herein, a paradoxical circuit designs provide robust population control.",
                                "Finally, it was asked whether the paradoxical architecture could suppress cheater mutants for the reasons predicted by the model. Loss of auxin sensing is the predominant cheating mode under negative feedback conditions. This was observed above with Sender-Receiver-PIN2 cells (FIG. 11E), and again, independently, with Paradoxical Control cells cultured under negative feedback conditions (without AP1903) (FIG. 12A). In the paradoxical circuit design, the expression of BlastR and iCasp9 are both up-regulated by loss of auxin perception. Consequently, most adaptive mutations that up-regulate BlastR should also increase iCasp9 expression, and thereby become susceptible to AP1903-dependent killing (FIG. 12C). For this reason, paradoxical conditions should select against loss of signal sensing. In fact, cells evolved under paradoxical conditions did exhibit significantly different basal expression and auxin-responsiveness than cheaters evolved under negative feedback alone (FIG. 12A, blue/green dots, all p<0.01). These results show that the paradoxical architecture achieved greater evolutionary robustness by successfully blocking the predominant mutational escape path to cheating.",
                                "**Discussion**",
                                "Natural cytokine-based control circuits allow cells to regulate their own population dynamics, as well as those of other cell types. Synthetic circuits could provide analogous capabilities. To this end, simultaneous production and sensing of the plant hormone auxin was engineered in mammalian cells, and it was coupled to genes controlling cell proliferation and death. The enzymes iaaH and iaaM, together with PIN2, allow cells to produce and export auxin. osTIR1 together with AID domains provide a simple, direct means of sensing auxin and coupling it to arbitrary protein targets (FIGS. 1-2). These components thus provide a long-range private communication channel, and enable the foundational property of quorum sensing (FIG. 3). Coupling quorum sensing to cell survival opens up the possibility of creating population control circuits, provoking the question of what circuit architectures can provide robust, long-term control. Consistent with previous work, mathematical modeling showed that a paradoxical architecture, in which auxin inhibits survival mediated by BlastR and killing by iCasp9, can generate a range of qualitatively different behaviors and, in some regimes, can suppress cheaters (FIGS. 4E and 4G). To experimentally realize this capability, the \u201cParadaux\u201d circuit was constructed, and was compared its operation in three distinct regimes\u2014uncontrolled growth, negative feedback, and paradoxical\u2014by using media with different combinations of blasticidin and AP1903 (FIG. 4B). Long-term culturing for up to 43 days revealed that while both negative and paradoxical feedback architectures can limit cell population size for weeks, the former is more susceptible to escape by sensing-deficient cheaters (FIG. 5, FIG. 7B, and FIG. 9). By contrast, the paradoxical design suppressed these cheaters, as predicted theoretically (FIGS. 4 and 5), and provided more robust population control for the conditions and timescales explored here.",

Though this provides a good external control method for our experimental setup, it might be suboptimal in some embodiments.

In some embodiments of the circuits provided herein, blasticidin and its auxin-regulated resistance gene for growth control is replaced with corresponding growth control proteins and agents provided herein. For example, in some embodiments, enzyme-prodrug systems provide an alternative approach with fewer non-specific effects on host cells.

Provided herein are methods and compositions for reducing feedback delays and/or implementing more sophisticated control systems that can facilitate non-oscillatory homeostatic dynamics. Finally, although the paradoxical control system successfully extended the duration of population control, cells nevertheless accumulated changes (FIG. 5 and FIG. 9).

The inserts are removed and the whole dish is washed with PBS twice to remove non-attached Sender-Receiver cells. Receiver cells were then seeded in the dish at approximately 20% confluence, and allowed to settle down for another 6 hours. To prepare agarose infused media, 2% low melting point agarose (EMD) was melted in alpha-MEM at 95\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes, and temperature was cooled to 42\u00b0 C., before IAM and other ingredients of complete media (described above) were mixed in.

For each experiment, around 5 images were used in Ilastik pixel classification mode to train a classifier (decision tree-based), that classifies each pixel as cell or not cell (the trained models are available with the full data set).
