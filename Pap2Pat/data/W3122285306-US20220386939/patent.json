                        "The present disclosures overcomes the drawbacks of previously known methods by providing an improved method of intra-operative histopathology. In one embodiment of the methods, second harmonic generation (SHG) signals first identify the layers of a tissue that are suspected to be in close proximity to ganglion cells. These SHG signals are used to narrow down regions of interest that may contain ganglion cells. In some embodiments, the SHG signals come from collagen. An autofluorescence (AF) signal, such as a two-photon excitation AF signal, is also generated and provides a negative image contrast to further narrow down regions that may contain ganglion cells. In some embodiments, ganglion cells cannot emit an AF signal, and therefore the ganglion cells show up as dark, negative contrast regions in an AF image.",
                        "Both the SHG and AF signals provide an initial idea where ganglion cells can or may be in a region of interest, but their signatures are generally still not specific enough to surpass typical H&E stained biopsies. The present disclosure also identifies several Raman peaks that further distinguish ganglion cells and provide greater specificity and sensitivity in tissue biopsy.",
                        "Thus, a method for determining if a tissue is ganglionic is disclosed herein. The method can include and comprises, or consists essentially of, or yet further consists of: a) generating at least one hyperspectral Raman image of a tissue from a region of interest in a tissue suspected to contain ganglion cells that was optionally identified by a method comprising, or consisting essentially of, or yet further consisting of autofluorescence (AF) and Second Harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of the tissue; and b) analyzing any of the images for one or more of: i) optical excitation, ii) chemical information or emission spectra; or iii) AF, SHG, and/or Raman signatures, wherein the analysis provides indicators that the region of interest is either ganglionic or non-ganglionic. The method further can include identifying the tissue as ganglionic or non-ganglionic. For example, the image contrast provided by SHG and AF can enable visualization of overall tissue morphology and localization of regions that can or may have ganglion cells, while Raman signatures (RS) can provide detailed multiplexed molecular information that can be used to accurately identify specific ganglion cells.",
                        "In one aspect, the method further comprises, or consists essentially of, or consists of, or includes comparing an indicator from a region of interest to an indicator from a tissue adjacent to the region of interest. In some embodiments, the comparison includes analysis of a difference spectrum between tissue from a region of interest and an adjacent tissue, wherein an intensity peak on the difference spectrum at one of about 710 cm\u22121, about 734 cm\u22121, about 797 cm\u22121, about 859 cm\u22121, about 924 cm\u22121, about 1216 cm\u22121, about 1362 cm\u22121, about 1440 cm\u22121, or about 1660 cm\u22121. The method can also be performed intraoperatively identifies a ganglionic tissue from a non-ganglionic tissue.",

Autofluorescence imaging can also include negative contrast images. In some embodiments, autofluorescence can be two-photon autofluorescence. In certain embodiments, autofluorescence can be one-photon autofluorescence, optionally in a range of excitation wavelengths between about 375 nm to about 525 nm. Autofluorescence can also be tuned to different excitation wavelengths between about 750 nm to about 1050 nm. In some embodiments, the excitation wavelengths between about 750 nm to about 1050 nm for two-photon autofluorescence achieve the equivalent of about 375 nm to about 525 nm excitation using one-photon autofluorescence. Autofluorescence images can also be generated based on emission signals spanning from about 440 nm to about 700 nm.",
                        "In some embodiments, the region of interest can be identified by a method that comprises, or consists essentially of, or consists of, or includes Second Harmonic Generation (SHG). SHG can convert light of wavelength \u03bb to light of wavelength \u03bb/2. For purposes of the methods disclosed herein, wherein a laser can be tuned to a wavelength from about 700 nm to about 1600 nm and a bandpass filter centered at about 350 nm to about 800 nm can collect the SHG signal. In certain embodiments of the method, the laser can be tuned to a wavelength of about 930 nm and a bandpass filter centered at about 465 nm collects the SHG signal.",

For example, in some embodiments, multivariate statistical analyses can be performed by a method selected from at least one of principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or leave-n-out cross validation methods. Any analysis of tissue data can be performed by a method selected from machine learning models, optionally including support vector machines (SVM) or non-probabilistic binary linear classifiers. For example, SVM, PCA, and LDA classification models can be applied to the hyperspectral Raman data to detect ganglion cells with a classification accuracy higher than 95 percent, enabling a near real-time, intraoperative histology method.",
                        "More than one hyperspectral Raman image can be mosaicked to generate a multidimensional Raman image of the tissue. In some embodiments, the Raman image can be mosaicked using at least one of a line scan microscope or a point scan microscope. In some embodiments, a plurality of pixel rows of the CCD chip of a detector collect all spectra in parallel and a motorized stage is used for lateral scanning and a piezo objective scanner is used for Z positioning.",
                        "In some embodiments of the methods, tissue samples from a region of interest can include murine tissue, porcine tissue, or human tissue. Tissue samples can be derived from whole tissue biopsy or cultured patient samples. The samples can be fresh, frozen, and preserved.",

In certain further embodiments, tissue from the region of interest is further compared to tissue sample analyses performed using Haemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining or calretinin immunohistochemistry to verify whether the region of interest tissues are normal or non-ganglionic.",
                        "The method can be performed in lieu of ex vivo H&E staining. Generating the at least one hyperspectral Raman image and analyzing the image (e.g., for one or more of optical excitation, chemical information or emission spectra, or AF, SHG, and/or Raman signatures) can also repeated more than once and using optical sectioning, z-stack imaging, and mosaicking to produce volumetric imaging of the region of interest without manual, physical sectioning.",
                        "In some embodiments of the methods, a continuous wave (CW) 785 nm laser is used for Raman excitation. Second Harmonic Generation signals can be excited using about 780 nm light and collected with a 390 nm bandpass filter in front of a PMT channel.",

In certain embodiments, the system further comprises, or consists essentially of, or consists of, or includes at least one of a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser or a CW laser. In certain embodiments, the system further comprises, or consists essentially of, or consists of, or includes motorized mirrors, optical shutters, a positioning stage, and software configured to provide hardware control and data acquisition from images generated by the microscopes.",
                        "The system can be housed in an endoscope configured to navigate intestinal tissue, colorectal tissue, or any tissue of the gastrointestinal tract. When unsectioned tissue is placed on a microscope the system can be automated to generate an AF/SHG image, pinpoint regions for further hyperspectral Raman analysis, acquire hyperspectral Raman data from said regions, optically section the tissue and repeat the measurement and analysis on another z-planes of the tissue, and compare spectra to a gold standard spectral database to arrive at a final tissue diagnosis. This automated process can be iterated more than once to create images that can be mosaicked to determine a larger field of view image.",
                        "In some embodiments, the system can be configured to acquire images at a tissue depth up to about 400 \u03bcm. The system can also be configured to be portable, sized to fit in an operating room, maneuverable on wheels, and activated and manipulated by a user intraoperatively. In certain embodiments, Raman spectroscopic signals can be detected using a spectrometer equipped with a spectral window of about 500 to about 2000 cm\u22121 and a TE-cooled CCD camera."

The method may further comprise, or consist essentially of, or consist of, or include identifying the tissue as ganglionic or non-ganglionic. At least one of the AF or SHG signals can be evaluated to detect a contrast between at least a first region and a second region (which can be adjacent to the first region), and a candidate region potentially having ganglionic cells detected from the first region responsive to the contrast satisfying a threshold (e.g., the contrast is a sufficiently negative contrast to satisfy the threshold; the threshold can be determined based on validating the threshold using tissue stained image data).",

                                "In surgical treatment of conditions such as Hirschsprung Disease, surgeons typically perform a pull-through procedure in which a non-ganglionic segment of the intestine is removed and the remaining healthy intestine is attached to the anus. To guide the surgeon in identifying the boundary between the healthy and diseased regions of the intestine, several biopsies that undergo histopathological analysis are required. A biopsy is initially performed close to the anus, which is delivered to the pathology lab and processed (i.e., sectioned & H&E stained). The slides are reviewed by a pathologist to determine if ganglion cells are present. If ganglion cells are not detected, another biopsy needs to be performed higher up in the intestine. This process may need to be repeated several times until a biopsy sample comes back positive for ganglion cells. This long process can add a considerable amount of time to the surgical procedure. This process requires intraoperative surgical biopsies at multiple levels of the distal bowel (FIG. 3) to identify the extent of abnormal intestine, often adding hours to an operation while a child is under general anesthesia. FIG. 3 shows the challenge that surgeons face in determining how much colon to resect. Excessive removal of healthy bowel or incomplete resection are both undesirable. H&E staining of multiple biopsies is often required. Procedures can be performed as described herein in which the removed tissue can be analyzed using imaging techniques to detect ganglionic or non-ganglionic cells, enabling intra-operative detection times.",
                                "FIG. 4 (a) is an illustration of the cross section of intestinal tissue showing different layers. The ganglion cells form the network of nerves called the myenteric plexus (Auerbach plexus) located between the smooth muscle layers of the GI tract wall and the submucosal plexus (Meissner plexus) within the submucosa of the GI tract wall. A tissue biopsy, millimeters in dimension, usually includes all layers. In a typical protocol, the tissue biopsy is sectioned into 15 serial 5 \u03bcm thick slices. This initial \u2018pilot\u2019 section is H&E stained and examined for the presence of ganglion cells. If none are present, another about 60 serial sections are prepared and examined. These about 75 serial sections, amounting to a total of about 375 \u03bcms of tissue, are typically sufficient to perform an assessment of whether the biopsy sample is normal or non-ganglionic. As depicted in FIG. 4(b) the biopsy can be physically sectioned, typically up to seventy-five 5 \u03bcm sections to ensure thorough examination for the presence/absence of ganglion cells. FIG. 4(c) shows H&E staining is often used to image each tissue section and to identify ganglion cells (arrows).",
                                "In certain embodiments of the proposed methods, a fresh biopsy sample is obtained by the surgeon and analyzed at the surgeon's side to provide immediate, accurate, objective diagnosis of the tissue. As such, the sometimes repetitive and time consuming processes involved with delivering, processing (sectioning, staining), and analyzing the specimen at the pathology lab can be circumvented. Table 1 summarizes the key advantages of the proposed technology compared to current H&E histopathology.",

The chemical information provided by these modalities enable localization and identification of ganglion cells. The confocal and multiphoton nature of these optical methods enable high-resolution deep tissue imaging that can cover the about 400 \u03bcms of tissue typically used by pathologists to assess a biopsy sample. (In fact, up to 800 \u03bcms of tissue can be analyzed by interrogating both sides of the biopsy sample). This analysis can be performed directly on fresh tissue without needing to fix and section. The label-free capabilities of these techniques can provide morphological and chemical information without needing stains or labels. The optical signals that are acquired directly from the tissue are unique chemical fingerprints that can be used for highly specific, accurate, and objective identification of ganglion cells to minimize the subjectivity of human analysis and interpretation."

These fluorophores are used for a broad range of applications, such as monitoring metabolic functions of cells and tissues under normal and experimental conditions or for real-time diagnosis of oncological and other diseases. For example, NAD(P)H and flavins are two of the most extensively studied endogenous fluorophores. NAD(P)H is fluorescent in the reduced state and flavins in the oxidized state, and the AF emission properties are strongly dependent on the bound/free condition of these molecules. Hence, the ratiometric measurement of these two molecules can provide information about energetic metabolism, cell oxidative defense, biosynthesis, and signal transduction. Lipofuscin and lipofuscin-like lipopigments are another type of fluorophore whose fluorescence properties depend on composition, crosslinks and oxidation degree, and aging. Lipofuscins can be present in undigested material remaining from phagocytosis and autophagy processes, accumulating as intracytoplasmic granules depending on physiological and metabolic situations. This signal has been used to monitor oxidative stress as a response to pathological conditions (e.g., Batten disease) or to measure the toxic effects of compounds. There are many other endogenous fluorophores that are excited and emit fluorescence at different wavelengths. FIG. 6 shows the spectral profile of many molecules that can contribute to AF in biological materials. These signals can be generated using either one-photon or two-photon excitation. Regions that have ganglion cells can have lower AF signals compared to adjacent tissue, resulting in these regions having a negative contrast in the AF images."

This technique is based on the unique optical property of certain molecules to convert light of wavelength \u03bb, to light of wavelength \u03bb/2 because of their non-centrosymmetric ordered molecular structure. Primarily implemented as an optical imaging technique, SHG microscopy has previously been used to image the myosin rod bundles in cardiomyocytes and collagen in tissue. The SHG signal can be strongly detected from connective tissue rich in collagen (e.g., from a submucosal region), thus providing an optical marker for detection of the orientation of an unstained tissue section.",

A Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser tunable from about 750-1000 nm is the excitation source. The laser beam can be focused onto the sample with a high numerical aperture objective (NA=1.2) and can be scanned across the sample using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. The laser can be tuned to a wavelength 1=930 nm and a PMT with a bandpass filter centered at \u03bb/2=465 nm collects the SHG signal. Another PMT with a 510-590 nm filter collects the GFP signal from the tumor cells (green). Note that although SHG signals are known to propagate primarily in the forward direction due to phase matching conditions and is measured using a detector in the forward position, SHG signals can also be detected in the backward direction as well (not shown). This ratio of forward to backward signals can provide additional information about the degree of collagen fiber ordering. FIG. 7(a) shows an example of a tissue image taken with Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) alone. FIG. 7(b) depicts fluorescence signals from green fluorescent protein labeled oral squamous cell carcinoma acquired simultaneously with a multiphoton microscope.

Briefly, an Olympus Fluoview 300 inverted scanning confocal microscope is equipped with multiple ports that allow for simultaneous detection of both AF and SHG signals. A Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser is used for exciting both SHG and two photon autofluorescence. In one channel, SHG signals are detected using a bandpass filter with a center wavelength at half the excitation wavelength. In the second channel, AF signals generated via two photon excitation are detected using a bandpass filter matching the emission spectrum. For example, an excitation wavelength of 940 nm would yield an SHG signal at 470 nm, and a fluorescence signal from 510-590 nm.

Analysis of spectral peak intensities that have statistically significant (p<0.05) differences for discriminating ganglion cells from adjacent tissue is a straightforward method. Principal component analysis (PCA), a multivariate statistical method, is also implemented in analyzing the Raman data. PCA is an unsupervised method for reducing data dimensionality and determining the combination of Raman spectral peaks that maximizes the data variance and group separation. PCA is a convenient, objective approach to determine whether the ganglion cells can be identified and discriminated from other tissue regions based on their Raman fingerprints. The PCA scatter plot in FIG. 10, which uses the first three principal components that capture the data variance, is a convenient way to visualize the degree with which the spectra obtained from the ganglion cell regions cluster together and how they separate from the spectra of adjacent tissue regions. The PCA plot indicates that the unique spectral signature of the ganglion cells can be used to discriminate the cells from the rest of the tissue.",
                                "For data classification, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) may also be used. LDA is a supervised modeling technique that finds the best linear combination of variables to discriminate between groups. As inputs for the LDA, the scores on the PCs which showed the highest discrimination of ganglion cells and adjacent tissues, are used. The classification sensitivity and specificity of this LDA model for correctly identifying ganglion cells is evaluated by using a leave-n-out cross validation method. Data is split into training and testing sets and the training sets are used to establish the LDA model. The test sets are used as inputs to the LDA model to determine diagnostic accuracy, classification sensitivity and specificity based on true negative, true positive, false negative and false positive values determined by the LDA model. For example, based on the PCA results shown in FIG. 10, when the three PCs were used as inputs into the LDA model and leave-n-out cross validation was performed, the classification sensitivity and specificity for identifying ganglion cells from adjacent tissue was 90% and 93% respectively.

Rather, the classification model needs to be established based on the \u2018gold standard\u2019 database developed, and the unknown Raman spectra are classified as ganglion or non-ganglion based on this established model. To do this, support vector machine (SVM) classification is used, a machine learning supervised model that, when given a set of training examples (i.e. the gold standard database), builds a model that assigns new examples (i.e., the newly acquired data) to one category or the other. In SVM, a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector, and the goal is whether it is possible to separate such points into two groups with a (p-1)-dimensional hyperplane, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. The Raman image data can be processed based on averaging of signals from areas of two by two pixels (e.g., rather than from a single Raman image pixel), which can increase signal to noise ratio (SNR) and yield more reproducible data while retaining high spatial resolution.",

Next, unknown Raman spectra acquired from another tissue sample were acquired and compared to the classification results to H&E. Preliminary results indicated that SVM was able to classify 88% of spectra acquired in the negative contrast AF region (i.e. ganglion cells) as \u201cganglion cell\u201d. Meanwhile, 100% of spectra acquired in a negative contrast AF region that turned out to be non-ganglion cells in an H&E image was correctly classified as \u201cnon-ganglion\u201d. Optical excitation and emission parameters and AF, SHG, and Raman signatures that will accurately identify ganglion cells and distinguish them from adjacent tissue were established. The classification specificity and sensitivity of the spectra for identifying and discriminating ganglion cells and for identifying tissue type (normal, non-ganglionic) are also determined. Finally, classification models and algorithms are determined based on PCA, LDA, leave-n-out cross validation, and SVM. By using the SHG/AF imaging to detect candidate regions potentially having ganglion cells, and subsequently performing Raman imaging of the candidate regions, the ganglion cells can be detected accurately and rapidly (e.g., with the specificity enabled by the Raman imaging and targeted to a subset of regions\u2014the candidate regions\u2014using the SHG/AF imaging).

De-identified non-ganglionic tissue is obtained from the UC Davis Biorepository. Similar experiments as those described in Example 1 are performed on these specimens to determine if aganglionosis can be accurately diagnosed. To be sure of the tissue diagnosis, a clinical pathologist first evaluates the stained sections and only those samples that are \u201cunequivocally Hirschsprung disease\u201d and \u201cunequivocally not Hirschsprung disease\u201d are used. Other samples that are \u201cinsufficient\u201d or \u201cequivocal\u201d are not used. Final diagnosis information is kept from the researcher until after the diagnosis is made based on the AF/SHG/Raman data. Sensitivity and specificity of multimodal optical imaging is calculated in comparison to the gold standard diagnosis. An effective sample size is needed to determine sensitivity and specificity of the presently disclosed techniques and methods. A power analysis was performed. With an estimated sensitivity of 97%, a precision of 0.07 (14% confidence interval), an alpha of 5%, and a prevalence of 30%, the sample size needed was 76. With an estimated specificity of 97%, a precision of 0.07, an alpha of 5%, and prevalence of 30%, the sample size needed was 33. Since both sensitivity and specificity need to be calculated, the total sample size needed is the larger of the two numbers, which is 76. Another power analysis was performed to determine the effective sample size needed to determine noninferiority between the presently disclosed imaging methods and conventional histopathology. With an estimated 80% power, a one-sided alpha of 5%, and allowing a 10% difference between the expected sensitivity of 97% and historical H&E specificity of 97%, the sample size needed is 72, with surgical sourcing of approximately 2-5 colonic biopsies per month. These include patients with known Hirschsprung disease, as well patients in whom Hirschsprung disease can be ruled out (and thus are normal controls). If 3 biopsies per month are performed, over a three year period more the 90 samples are more than enough to achieve proper power for statistical analysis. Results demonstrate that unique spectral signatures exist for ganglion cells in human tissue specimens that can be used to identify and discriminate them from adjacent tissue regions."

                                "Examples 1-2 utilize two separate, manual optical systems, a multiphoton AF/SHG microscope and a hyperspectral Raman microscope. The measurements are also made on tissue sections. Example 3 demonstrates fully automated analysis and diagnosis of unsectioned, whole tissue patient biopsies, i.e., the final clinical implementation of the systems and methods: a single, combined system for automated tissue analysis. Existing SHG/AF microscopes are modified to add on the hyperspectral Raman capability and implement full automation. In some embodiments of the system, a microscope has an additional entrance port that allows for the Raman excitation laser to be coupled into the system. In further embodiments, an additional exit port is also available and used to collect the Raman scattered photons. For full automation, motorized mirrors (Newport), optical shutters (Thorlabs), and a positioning stage (Physik Instruments), can be added to the system. In some embodiments of the system, a National Instruments (NI) board and LabView software can be used for hardware control and data acquisition. All other components of the hyperspectral Raman microscope described in Example 1 are duplicated in this setup. The LabView software controls all aspects of hardware automation, such as switching between the multiphoton and the CW Raman laser, triggering the detectors for acquiring the optical signals, generating the images based on the acquired signals, scanning the stage for image mosaicking, and changing the z-plane focus. The Labview software also has the function to call the Matlab software for performing the image processing, analysis, and classification as described in Example 1.",

                                "After the user places an unsectioned piece of tissue on the microscope, the microscope is able to automatically i) generate an AF/SHG image; ii) pinpoint regions for further hyperspectral Raman analysis; iii) acquire hyperspectral Raman data from those regions; iv) optically section the tissue and repeat the measurement and analysis on another z-plane of the tissue; v) compare spectra to a gold standard spectral database and arrive at a final diagnosis.",
                                "After the tissue is mounted on the microscope stage, the stage can move to the z-plane of the tissue closest to the glass coverslip. To calibrate the optical system on the tissue orientation, the software scans the stage to find the tissue edge based on a brightfield intensity threshold difference between the tissue and the coverslip. Starting from this edge, an AF/SHG image is acquired. Detection of the SHG signal also assists in providing information to the system on the location of the muscle layers. The stage moves to the next position and another image is acquired. This process can be repeated and the images mosaicked by the software to create a larger field of view image. Once the image is created, it is exported to the Matlab software, which runs a program that automates the detection of regions of interest that possibly contain ganglion cells (i.e. the program detects the negative contrast dark regions based on a low signal intensity threshold criteria). The pixel coordinates of these regions are fed back to the Labview software, which moves the stage to those coordinates. The system can switch to the hyperspectral Raman mode and Raman data is collected from these regions. The spectral data is then fed to a Matlab routine that processes and classifies the data by comparing to reference spectra using SVM. The stage is then stepped in the longitudinal Z-axis in increments defined by the user (e.g. 5 \u03bcm step size) and the process can be repeated. A final diagnosis of the tissue type (normal, non-ganglionic) is determined. The tissue can then processed by H&E and diagnosed by a pathologist, and the two diagnoses can be compared.",

                                "The system is designed to image up to 400 \u03bcms. Automated image acquisition can be performed with Z-axis scanning in increments of 20 \u03bcms to determine the maximum depth at which optical signals can no longer be detected for generating images. It is known that multiphoton microscopy can typically image several hundreds of microns deep into tissue due to the intrinsic confocality and use of long wavelengths that can penetrate deep into tissue. For hyperspectral Raman imaging, however, because excitation can be performed at 785 nm, the tissue penetration depth at that wavelength may not allow such deep probing. Thus, different excitation wavelengths from about 700 through about 1600 nm can be tested using a tunable CW laser. At longer wavelengths (1064-1600 nm), optical filters in the hyperspectral Raman beam path of the system and the detector may be need to be changed. In some embodiments, the detector may be changed to an InGaAs CCD camera capable of sensitivity at longer wavelengths.",
                                "In some embodiments, imaging an about 2 mm\u00d72 mm image plane can be performed in approximately 50 seconds. Analysis of an initial 15 sections is therefore expected to take about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes, which is faster than current methods. Currently, if pathologists see ganglion cells in this pilot section, no further analysis is needed. If needed, additional analysis of sections beyond the first 15 sections would add approximately 1 minute/section to the total time."
