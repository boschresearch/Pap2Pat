# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD

The present description relates to peptidomimetic foldamers, and their synthesis. In particular, the description provides peptide-amino urea hybrid peptidomimetic foldamers comprising an alpha amino acid peptide portion and an oligourea portion.

## BACKGROUND

Interactions between proteins and/or their substrates or ligands are critical for normal cell function, physiologic signal transduction, as well as for therapeutic intervention in many pathophysiologic or disease-related processes. Proteins and peptides are capable of adopting compact, well-ordered conformations, and performing complex chemical operations, e.g., catalysis, highly selective recognition, etc. The three dimensional structure is the principal determinant that governs specificity in protein-protein and/or protein-substrate interactions. Thus, the conformation of peptides and proteins is central for their biological function, pharmaceutical efficacy, and their therapeutic preparation.

During the past decade, peptide therapeutics have gained considerable attention in pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). Indeed, peptides have proved to be valuable tools to access extra-cellular targets with medium to large active sites and they are now intensively investigated to access intracellular protein-protein interaction (PPI) targets, a very important topic in recent pharmaceutical research. This is remarkable considering peptides have important shortcomings as they generally show poor membrane permeability, poor bioavailability, and short in vivo half-life.

Protein folding is inextricably linked to function in both proteins and peptides because the creation of an “active site” requires proper positioning of reactive groups. Much effort has been invested in peptide and peptidomimetic chemistries to address those weaknesses in the hope of finding an alternative to peptides. Researches have endeavoured to identify synthetic polymer or oligomers, which display discrete and predictable (i.e., stable) folding and oligomerizing propensities (hereinafter referred to as “foldamers”) to mimic natural biological systems. Insofar as these unnatural backbones are resistant to the action of proteases and peptidases, they are useful as probes having constrained conformational flexibility or as therapeutics with improved pharmacological properties, e.g., enhanced pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamics (PD) features, such as potency and/or half-life. Whereas a naturally occurring polypeptide comprised entirely of α-amino acid residues will be readily degraded by any number of proteases and peptidases, foldamers, including hybrids of natural peptides and synthetic amino acid derivatives, mimetics or pseudopeptides, are not.

Foldamers are also interesting molecules because of their conformational behavior. The elucidation of foldamers having discrete conformational propensities akin to those of natural proteins has led to explorations of peptides constructed from β-, γ-, or δ-amino acids. γ-Peptides containing residues bearing γ-substitution or a, γ-disubstitution or α, β, γ-trisubstitution have been shown to adopt a helical conformation defined by a 14-member turn that is stabilized by C=O(i)→NH(i+3) hydrogen bonds. Both the 314 and 2.512 helical backbones have been found suitable for the design of stabilized helical peptides useful for therapeutic purposes. For example, in order to cluster polar residues on one face of the helix, amphiphilic 314-helical β-peptides have been constructed from hydrophobic-cationic-hydrophobic- or hydrophobic-hydrophobic-cationic residue triads.

A key principle of foldamer research is to use biomolecules as inspiration for the design and development of molecules with functions and capabilities beyond those found in nature, such as catalysts or artificial bio-receptors with tailored ligand specificity. As function is intimately linked with structure, the creation of new and unique foldamer architectures is a necessary step towards the goal of developing foldamers with tailored/preternatural functions. However, the construction of novel foldamer structures can be challenging, particularly the creation of multi-component architectures, which require controlled, precise self-assembly.

Oligomers of residues having a C1-C4 aminoalkylene carbamoyl structure (i.e., “oligoureas”) comprising amino acid side chains or analogs thereof are in the limited list of such potential foldamers as they offer 3-D space similarity, metabolic compatibility, water solubility, and flexibility of functionalities. Like peptides, oligoureas (alkylene diamine residues having a urea bridging unit) are synthesised by iterative coupling on solid support and possess their own secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures based on their sequences. The compatibility of peptide-oligourea hybrids in biological systems and their utilisation in vivo is not well understood. However, the oligourea backbone is resistant to proteases and can be interfaced with peptide α-helices as it adopts an helical conformation that does not disrupt the peptide α-helix propagation. This is noteworthy as 1) many biologically active peptides contain an α-helix (a large fraction of PPIs involve an α-helix) and 2) those portions could potentially be replaced or partially replaced by oligoureas to preserve binding while improving the proteolytic resistance of the peptide. Such strategy would be a valuable tool to design new peptide therapeutics as their pharmaceutical properties could be improved.

The design and construction of biomimetic systems is a challenging yet potentially highly rewarding endeavour, contributing to the development of new biomaterials, catalysts, drug-delivery systems and tools for the manipulation of biological processes. The design of entirely new, non-natural folded architectures resembling biopolymers with the ability to adopt well-defined stable secondary structures comparable to those found in nature have considerable potential for use in a range of applications such as bio-materials, bio-recognition, nano-machines and as therapeutic agents. As such, there exists an ongoing need in the art for the design and production of peptidomimetic compounds that are both efficacious and that overcome one or more of the problems observed with natural amino acid structures.

## SUMMARY

Oligoureas represent interesting classes of peptidomimetic foldamers that have previously received little attention. The present disclosure relates to the surprising and unexpected discovery that alpha-amino acid peptide-amino urea hybrid foldamer compounds (i.e., “peptide-amino urea hybrids” or “peptide-oligourea hybrids”) can be designed, which preserve the function of the native or parental alpha-amino acid peptide, but that also demonstrate superior half-life and protease resistance. The peptide-oligourea hybrids as described herein are compounds in which a portion of the native or parental alpha-amino acid sequence is replaced or substituted by at least one amino urea residue comprising substitutions, e.g., naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid side chains, that mimic the secondary structure conformation and biochemistry of the native or parental peptide (a substitution comprising a plurality of amino urea residues is referred to herein as an “oligourea”). In a particular aspect, it was surprisingly discovered that one can replace alpha-amino acids from the native or parental peptide with fewer amino urea residues, which can reduce the size of the peptide. Also, because the peptide-oligourea hybrid compounds as described herein can adopt desired secondary structures similar to the native or parental peptides, including, e.g., helicoidal structures, they can serve as, for example, receptor ligands, effector molecules, agonists, antagonists, modulators of protein-protein interactions, organocatalysts, or enzymes.

The following is a detailed description of the invention provided to aid those skilled in the art in practicing the present disclosure. Those of ordinary skill in the art may make modifications and variations in the embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the disclosure. All publications, patent applications, patents, figures and other references mentioned herein are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Furthermore, the disclosures of each and every patent, patent application, and publication cited herein are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

As described above, oligoureas represent interesting classes of peptidomimetic foldamers. Presently described are alpha-amino acid peptide-amino urea hybrid foldamer compounds (i.e., “peptide-amino urea hybrid” or “peptide-oligourea hybrid” compounds) that preserve the function of the native or parental alpha-amino acid peptide, but that also demonstrate superior half-life and protease resistance. The peptide-oligourea hybrid compounds as described herein are compounds in which a portion of the native or parental alpha-amino acid sequence is replaced or substituted by at least one amino urea residue comprising substitutions, e.g., naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid side chains, that mimic the secondary structure conformation and biochemistry of the native or parental peptide (a substitution comprising a plurality of amino urea residues is referred to herein as an “oligourea”). As described herein below, it was surprisingly discovered alpha-amino acids from the native or parental peptide can be substituted or replaced with fewer amino urea residues. Because the peptide-oligourea hybrid compounds as described herein can adopt desired secondary structures similar to the native or parental peptides, including, e.g., helicoidal structures, they can serve as, for example, receptor ligands, effector molecules, agonists, antagonists, modulators of protein-protein interactions, organocatalysts, or enzymes.

Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise (such as in the case of a group containing a number of carbon atoms in which case each carbon atom number falling within the range is provided), between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the disclosure. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure.

The following terms are used to describe the present disclosure. In instances where a term is not specifically defined herein, that term is given an art-recognized meaning by those of ordinary skill applying that term in context to its use in describing the present invention.

The articles “a” and “an” as used herein and in the appended claims are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. By way of example, “an element” means one element or more than one element.

The phrase “and/or,” as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean “either or both” of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with “and/or” should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., “one or more” of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B”, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.

As used herein in the specification and in the claims, “or” should be understood to have the same meaning as “and/or” as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, “or” or “and/or” shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as “only one of” or “exactly one of,” or, when used in the claims, “consisting of,” will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term “or” as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e., “one or the other but not both”) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as “either,” “one of,” “only one of,” or “exactly one of.”

In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as “comprising,” “including,” “carrying,” “having,” “containing,” “involving,” “holding,” “composed of,” and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of” shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the 10 United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.

As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase “at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from anyone or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a nonlimiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.

It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any methods claimed herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts of the method is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method are recited.

“Peptides” are typically short chains of amino acid monomers linked by peptide (amide) bonds, the covalent chemical bonds formed when the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of another. The shortest peptides are dipeptides, consisting of 2 amino acids joined by a single peptide bond, followed by tripeptides, tetrapeptides, etc. A polypeptide is a long, continuous, and unbranched peptide chain.

The term “amino” or “amine” as used herein refers to —NH2 and substituted derivatives thereof wherein one or both of the hydrogens are independently replaced with 20 substituents selected from the group consisting of alkyl, haloalkyl, fluoro alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, carbocyclyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, aralkyl, heteroaryl, hetero aralkyl, alkylcarbonyl, haloalkylcarbonyl, carbocyclylcarbonyl, fluoroalkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, heterocyclylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, alkynylcarbonyl, aralkylcarbonyl, heteroarylcarbonyl, heteroaralkylcarbonyl and the sulfonyl and sulfinyl groups defined above; or when both hydrogens together are replaced with an alkylene group (to form a ring which contains the nitrogen). Representative examples include, but are not limited to methylamino, acetylamino, and dimethylamino.

“Amino acid” refers to any molecule that contains both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups, and includes any of the naturally occurring amino acids (e.g. Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Hyl, Hyp, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val) in D, L, or DL form. The side chains of naturally occurring amino acids are well known in the art and include, for example, hydrogen (e.g., as in glycine), alkyl (e.g., as in alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline), substituted alkyl (e.g., as in threonine, serine, methionine, cysteine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, glutamine, arginine, and lysine), alkaryl (e.g., as in phenylalanine and tryptophan), substituted arylalkyl (e.g., as in tyrosine), and heteroarylalkyl (e.g., as in histidine). The term is inclusive of various types of amino acids including α-, β-, γ-, or δ-amino acids, analogs and derivatives of the same, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

The term “amino acid sidechain” or “amino acid residue” shall mean, within context, a radical of a D- or L-amino acid sidechain (derived from an amino acid) which functions as a substituent on another group, often an alkylene (usually a methylene) group on R2′ or R3′ as otherwise described herein. Preferred amino acid sidechains for use in the present disclosure are derived from the sidechains of both natural and unnatural amino acids, preferably including, for example, alanine, β-alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cyclohexylalanine, cysteine, cystine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, phenylalanine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, leucine, methionine, naphthylalanine, norleucine, norvaline, proline, serine, threonine, valine, tryptophan or tyrosine, among others.

Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term “any amino acid” can mean any natural or synthetic amino acid, including α-, β-, γ-, or δ-amino acids, possibly modified by the presence of one or more substituents, or combinations thereof, including analogs, derivatives, mimetics, and peptoid versions of the same. More precisely the term α-amino acid means an alpha aminated amino acid with the following general structure:

where R represents the side chain of the amino acid. In the context of the present disclosure, R therefore represents the side chain of a side or non-side amino acid. The term “natural amino acid” means any amino acid which is found naturally in vivo in a living being. Natural amino acids therefore include amino acids coded by mRNA incorporated into proteins during translation but also other amino acids found naturally in vivo which are a product or by-product of a metabolic process, such as for example ornithine which is generated by the urea production process by arginase from L-arginine. In the present disclosure, the amino acids used can therefore be natural or not. Namely, natural amino acids generally have the L configuration but also, according to the disclosure, an amino acid can have the L or D configuration. Moreover, R is of course not limited to the side chains of natural amino acid but can be freely chosen.

As used herein, a “urea” group is an organic compound with the chemical formula CO(NH2)2. The molecule has two —NH2 groups joined by a carbonyl (C═O) functional group. Oligomers of, e.g., ethylenediamine residues having a urea linkage can be synthesized from ethyldiamine carbamoyl residues.

Unless indicated otherwise, the term “peptide precursor” or “parental peptide” refers, but is in no way limited to, a parental α-peptide sequence that is coupled with oligourea pseudopeptide or peptidomimetic subunits or substituting oligourea pseudopeptide subunits (i.e., exchanging one or more α-amino acids for one or more oligourea pseudopeptide subunits).

Unless indicated otherwise, the term “oligourea” refers, but is in no way limited to, a residue containing N, N′-linked urea residues including oligomers of substituted or unsubstituted N-2-ethylaminocarbamoyl or 1, 2-ethylene diamine residues.

The term “compound”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to any specific chemical compound disclosed herein and includes tautomers, regioisomers, geometric isomers, and where applicable, stereoisomers, including optical isomers (enantiomers) and other steroisomers (diastereomers) thereof, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives (including prodrug forms) thereof where applicable, in context. Within its use in context, the term compound generally refers to a single compound, but also may include other compounds such as stereoisomers, regioisomers and/or optical isomers (including racemic mixtures) as well as specific enantiomers or enantiomerically enriched mixtures of disclosed compounds. The term also refers, in context to prodrug forms of compounds which have been modified to facilitate the administration and delivery of compounds to a site of activity. It is noted that in describing the present compounds, numerous substituents and variables associated with same, among others, are described. It is understood by those of ordinary skill that molecules which are described herein are stable compounds as generally described hereunder. When the bond is shown, both a double bond and single bond are represented within the context of the compound shown.

The term “hydrocarbyl” shall mean a compound which contains carbon and hydrogen and which may be fully saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic and includes aryl groups, alkyl groups, alkenyl groups and alkynyl groups.

The term “amido” as used herein means an ammo group, as defined herein, appended to the parent molecular moiety through a carbonyl.

The term “cyano” as used herein means a —C═N group.

The term “nitro” as used herein means a —NO2 group. The term “azido” as used herein means a —N3 group.

The abbreviations Me, Et, Ph, Tf, Nf, Ts, Ms, Cbz, and Boc represent methyl, ethyl, phenyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl, nonafluorobutanesulfonyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, methanesulfonyl, carbobenzyloxy, and tert-butyloxycarbonyl, respectively.

A more comprehensive list of the abbreviations utilized by organic chemists of ordinary skill in the art appears in the first issue of each volume of the Journal of Organic Chemistry; this list is typically presented in a table entitled Standard List of Abbreviations, and is incorporated herein by reference.

“Alkyl” refers to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms, a branched or unbranched alkenyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms, a branched or unbranched alkinyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms. The term “alkyl” shall mean within its context a linear, branch-chained or cyclic fully saturated hydrocarbon radical or alkyl group, preferably a C1-C10, more preferably a C1-C6, alternatively a C1-C3 alkyl group, which may be optionally substituted. Examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, isopropyl, 2-methylpropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentylethyl, cyclohexylethyl and cyclohexyl, among others.

In certain embodiments, the effective amount is a therapeutically effective amount or a synergistically effective amount.

The compounds or compositions as described herein including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful for the preparation of a medicament and/or the treatment of disease in a subject. In the case where a salt of a compound is desired and the compound/composition is produced in the form of the desired salt, it can be subjected to purification as such. In the case where a compound/composition is produced in the free state and its salt is desired, the compound/composition is dissolved or suspended in a suitable organic solvent, followed by addition of an acid or a base to form a salt. As such, in an addition aspect the description provides compositions comprising an effective amount of a peptide-oligourea hybrid as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

The compounds or compositions of the description may optionally be administered with at least one of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, pharmacologically active agent or a combination thereof. These novel, unnatural peptidomimetics are resistant or wholly immune to peptidase and protease degradation and are conformationally restrained. Thus, they are useful as tools to model peptide and protein conformations in aqueous solutions. The compounds are also useful as non-enzymatically degradable probes to mimic protein behavior in solution. As such, the description further provides the compositions comprising an effective amount of a chimeric compound as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

Certain compounds or composition of the description and their salts may exist in more than one crystal form and the present disclosure includes each crystal form and mixtures thereof. Certain compounds/compositions of the disclosure and their salts may also exist in the form of solvates, for example hydrates, and the present disclosure includes each solvate and mixtures thereof.

Certain compounds/compositions of the disclosure may contain one or more chiral centers, and exist in different optically active forms. When compounds/compositions of the disclosure contain one chiral center, the compounds/compositions exist in two enantiomeric forms and the present disclosure includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemic mixtures. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step may be used to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.

When a compound or composition of the description contains more than one chiral center, it may exist in diastereoisomeric forms. The diastereoisomeric compounds may be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers may be separated as described above. The present disclosure includes each diastereoisomer of compounds of the disclosure and mixtures thereof.

Certain compounds of the disclosure may exist in different tautomeric forms or as different geometric isomers, and the present disclosure includes each tautomer and/or geometric isomer of compounds of the disclosure and mixtures thereof.

Certain compounds or compositions of the disclosure may exist in different stable conformational forms which may be separable. Torsional asymmetry due to restricted rotation about an asymmetric single bond, for example because of steric hindrance or ring strain, may permit separation of different conformers. The present disclosure includes each conformational isomer of compounds of the disclosure and mixtures thereof.

Certain compounds of the disclosure may exist in zwitterionic form and the present disclosure includes each zwitterionic form of compounds of the disclosure and mixtures thereof.

The present disclosure encompasses all possible isomers including tautomers and mixtures thereof. Where chiral carbons lend themselves to two different enantiomers, both enantiomers are contemplated as well as procedures for separating the two enantiomers.

The present disclosure also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, racemates, and optical isomers thereof. The compounds of this disclosure typically contain one or more chiral centers. Accordingly, this disclosure is intended to include racemic mixtures, diasteromers, enantiomers and mixture enriched in one or more stereoisomer. The scope of the disclosure as described and claimed encompasses the racemic forms of the compounds as well as the individual enantiomers and non-racemic mixtures thereof.

Many of the compounds of the disclosure may be provided as salts with pharmaceutically compatible counterions (i.e., pharmaceutically acceptable salts).

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is used throughout the specification to describe, where applicable, a salt form of one or more of the compounds or prodrugs described herein which are presented to increase the solubility of the compound in the gastic juices of the patient's gastrointestinal tract in order to promote dissolution and the bioavailability of the compounds. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and acids, where applicable. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium, magnesium and ammonium salts, among numerous other acids and bases well known in the pharmaceutical art. Sodium and potassium salts are particularly preferred as neutralization salts of the phosphates according to the present disclosure. In a preferred embodiment, the description provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the modified peptides as described herein, which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the parent compounds and which are not biologically or otherwise harmful as the dosage administered. The compounds of this disclosure are capable of forming both acid and base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and carboxy groups respectively.

A “pharmaceutically acceptable counterion” is an ionic portion of a salt that is not toxic when released from the salt upon administration to a recipient. Pharmaceutically compatible salts may be formed with many acids, including but not limited to hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents than are the corresponding free base forms.

Acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen bisulfide, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic, salicylic, tartaric, bitartaric, ascorbic, maleic, besylic, fumaric, gluconic, glucuronic, formic, glutamic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, lactic, oxalic, parabromophenylsulfonic, carbonic, succinic, citric, benzoic and acetic acid, and related inorganic and organic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, sub erate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-I,4-dioate, hexyne-I,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, -hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-I-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like salts.

Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and especially those formed with organic acids such as maleic acid. Suitable bases for forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with acidic functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxides of alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium; hydroxides of alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium; hydroxides of other metals, such as aluminum and zinc; ammonia, and organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxy-substituted mono-, di-, or trialkylamines; dicyclohexylamine; tributyl amine; pyridine; N-methyl,N-ethylamine; diethylamine; triethylamine; mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxy-Iower alkyl amines), such as mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert-butylamine, or tris-(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-di-lower alkyl-N(hydroxy lower alkyl)-amines, such as N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine; N-methyl-D-glucamine; and amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like.

Prodrugs

The description also provides prodrug forms of the above described peptide-oligourea hybrid compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce an analog or derivative as set forth above. Indeed, some of the described compounds may be a prodrug for another analog or derivative. The term “prodrug” is well understood in the art and refers to an agent which is converted into the parent drug in vivo by some physiological chemical process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to the physiological pH is converted to the desired drug form). For example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1980, vol. 16, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 61 and 424.

Pro-drugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmacological compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a pro-drug would be a compound of the present disclosure wherein it is administered as an ester (the “pro-drug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is not beneficial, but then it is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. Pro-drugs have many useful properties. For example, a pro-drug may be more water soluble than the ultimate drug, thereby facilitating intravenous administration of the drug. A pro-drug may also have a higher level of oral bioavailability than the ultimate drug. After administration, the prodrug is enzymatically or chemically cleaved to deliver the ultimate drug in the blood or tissue.

Exemplary pro-drugs upon cleavage release the corresponding free acid, and such hydrolyzable ester-forming residues of the compounds of this disclosure include but are not limited to carboxylic acid substituents (e.g., —C(O)2H or a moiety that contains a carboxylic acid) wherein the free hydrogen is replaced by (C1-C4)alkyl, (Cz-C12)alkanoyloxymethyl, (C4-C9)1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl, I-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, I-methyl-1-10 (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino) ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N—(C1-C2)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl (such as ˜-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl, N,N-die C1-C2)-alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-15 C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C2-C3)alkyl.

Other exemplary pro-drugs release an alcohol or amine of a compound of the disclosure wherein the free hydrogen of a hydroxyl or amine substituent is replaced by (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, I-methyl-1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C1-C6)alkoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl, N—(C1-C6)alkoxycarbonylamino-20 methyl, succinoyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(C1-C4)alkanoyl, arylactyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl wherein said a-aminoacyl moieties are independently any of the naturally occurring L-amino acids found in proteins, —P(O)(OH)2′-P(O)(O(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from detachment of the hydroxyl of the hemiacetal of a carbohydrate).

The phrase “protecting group” as used herein means temporary substituents which protect a potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The field of protecting group chemistry has been reviewed (Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective 30 Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). Protected forms of the inventive compounds are included within the scope of this disclosure.

The term “chemically protected form,” as used herein, pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions, that is, are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group). It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form.

By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts, Wiley, 1991), and Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).

For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (—OR) or an ester (—OC(═O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (—OC(═O)CH3,—OAc). For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (C(═O)) is converted to a diether (C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (NRC(═O)R) or a urethane (—NRC(═O)OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (—NHC(═O)CH3); a benzyloxy amide (—NHC(═O)OCH2C6HsNHCbz); as a t-butoxy amide (NHC=(═O)OC(CH3)3, —NHBoc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (NHC(═O)OC(CH3)2C6H4C6HsNHBoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (—NHFmoc), as a δ-nitroveratryloxy amide (—NHNvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (—NHTeoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (—NHTroc), as an allyloxy amide (—NHAlloc), as a 2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (—NHPsec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical.

For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester or an amide, for example, as: a benzyl ester; a t-butyl ester; a methyl ester; or a methyl amide. For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (—SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; or an acetamidomethyl ether (—SCH2NHC(═O)CH3). In at least certain examples, the compounds disclosed herein can be used in the treatment of disorders associated with pathogen infection. Disorders associated with infection by pathogens include, but are not limited to, infection by viruses (DNA viruses, RNA viruses, animal viruses, and the like), bacteria (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, and the like), fungi, parasitic microbes, nematodes, and the like.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” is used throughout the specification to describe any pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug form (such as an ester, amide other prodrug group) which, upon administration to a patient, provides directly or indirectly the present compound or an active metabolite of the present compound. The term “independently” is used herein to indicate that the variable, which is independently applied, varies independently from application to application.

Formulations

Suitable routes for administration include oral, peroral, rectal, vassal, topical (including ocular, buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parental (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravitreous, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural). The preferred route of administration will depend upon the condition of the patient, the toxicity of the compound and the site of infection, among other considerations known to the clinician.

The therapeutic composition of the disclosure comprises about 1% to about 95% of the active ingredient, single-dose forms of administration preferably comprising about 20% to about 90% of the active ingredient and administration forms which are not single-dose preferably comprising about 5% to about 20% of the active ingredient. Unit dose forms are, for example, coated tablets, tablets, ampoules, vials, suppositories or capsules. Other forms of administration are, for example, ointments, creams, pastes, foams, tinctures, lipsticks, drops, sprays, dispersions and the like. Examples are capsules containing from about 0.05 g to about 1.0 g of the active ingredient.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of convential mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes.

Preferably, solutions of the active ingredient, and in addition also suspensions or dispersions, especially isotonic aqueous solutions, dispersions or suspensions, are used, it being possible for these to be prepared before use, for example in the case of lyophilized compositions which comprise the active substance by itself or together with a carrier, for example mannitol. The pharmaceutical compositions can be sterilized and/or comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizing agents, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers, and they are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of convential dissolving or lyophilizing processes. The solutions or suspensions mentioned can comprise viscosity-increasing substances, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.

Pharmaceutically acceptable forms include, for example, a gel, lotion, spray, powder, pill, tablet, controlled release tablet, sustained release tablet, rate controlling release tablet, enteric coating, emulsion, liquid, salts, pastes, jellies, aerosols, ointments, capsules, gel caps, or any other suitable form that will be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art.

Suspensions in oil comprise, as the oily component, the vegetable, synthetic or semi-synthetic oils customary for injection purposes. Oils which may be mentioned are, in particular, liquid fatty acid esters which contain, as the acid component, a long-chain fatty acid having 8-22, in particular 12-22, carbon atoms, for example lauric acid, tridecylic acid, myristic acid, pentadecylic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachidinic acid, behenic acid or corresponding unsaturated acids, for example oleic acid, elaidic acid, euric acid, brasidic acid or linoleic acid, if appropriate with the addition of antioxidants, for example vitamin E, .beta.-carotene or 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoluene. The alcohol component of these fatty acid esters has not more than 6 carbon atoms and is mono- or polyhydric, for example mono-, di- or trihydric alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or pentanol, or isomers thereof, but in particular glycol and glycerol. Fatty acid esters are therefore, for example: ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, “Labrafil M 2375” (polyoxyethylene glycerol trioleate from Gattefosee, Paris), “Labrafil M 1944 CS” (unsaturated polyglycolated glycerides prepared by an alcoholysis of apricot kernel oil and made up of glycerides and polyethylene glycol esters; from Gattefosee, Paris), “Labrasol” (saturated polyglycolated glycerides prepared by an alcoholysis of TCM and made up of glycerides and polyethylene glycol esters; from Gattefosee, Paris) and/or “Miglyol 812” (triglyceride of saturated fatty acids of chain length C8 to C12 from Huls AG, Germany), and in particular vegetable oils, such as cottonseed oil, almond oil, olive oil, castor oil, sesame oil, soybean oil and, in particular, groundnut oil.

The preparation of the injection compositions is carried out in the customary manner under sterile conditions, as are bottling, for example in ampoules or vials, and closing of the containers.

For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral use can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with one or more solid carriers, if appropriate granulating the resulting mixture, and, if desired, processing the mixture or granules to tablets or coated tablet cores, if appropriate by addition of additional excipients.

Suitable carriers are, in particular, fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate, or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and furthermore binders, such as starches, for example maize, wheat, rice or potato starch, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, and/or, if desired, desintegrators, such as the above mentioned starches, and furthermore carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Additional excipients are, in particular, flow regulators and lubricants, for example salicylic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol, or derivatives thereof.

Coated tablet cores can be provided with suitable coatings which, if appropriate, are resistant to gastric juice, the coatings used being, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions, which, if appropriate, comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidine, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures or, for the preparation of coatings which are resistant to gastric juice, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate.

By “controlled release” it is meant for purposes of the present disclosure that therapeutically active compound is released from the preparation at a controlled rate or at a specific site, for example, the intestine, or both such that therapeutically beneficial blood levels (but below toxic levels) are maintained over an extended period of time, e.g., providing a 12 hour or a 24 hour dosage form.

The term “rate controlling polymer” as used herein includes hydrophilic polymers, hydrophobic polymers or mixtures of hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic polymers that are capable of retarding the release of the compounds in vivo. In addition, many of the same polymers can be utilized to create an enteric coating of a drug, drug suspension, or drug matrix. It is within the skill of those in the art to modify the coating thickness, permeability, and dissolution characteristics to provide the desired controlled release profile (e.g., drug release rate and locus) without undue experimentation.

The term “cancer” is used throughout the specification to refer to the pathological process that results in the formation and growth of a cancerous or malignant neoplasm, i.e., abnormal tissue that grows by cellular proliferation, often more rapidly than normal and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated the new growth cease. Malignant neoplasms show partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with the normal tissue and most invade surrounding tissues, metastasize to several sites, and are likely to recur after attempted removal and to cause the death of the patient unless adequately treated. As used herein, the term neoplasia is used to describe all cancerous disease states and embraces or encompasses the pathological process associated with malignant hematogenous, ascitic and solid tumors. Exemplary cancers which may be treated by the present compounds either alone or in combination with at least one additional anti-cancer agent include squamous-cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, cancer of the bladder, bowel, breast, cervix, colon, esophagus, head, kidney, liver, lung, neck, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and stomach; leukemias; benign and malignant lymphomas, particularly Burkitt's lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; benign and malignant melanomas; myeloproliferative diseases; sarcomas, including Ewing's sarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, liposarcoma, myosarcomas, peripheral neuroepithelioma, synovial sarcoma, gliomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, gliobastomas, neuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas, gangliogliomas, medulloblastomas, pineal cell tumors, meningiomas, meningeal sarcomas, neurofibromas, and Schwannomas; bowel cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, astrocytoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, melanoma; carcinosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, Wilms' tumor and teratocarcinomas.

Peptide-Oligourea Hybrids Design and Functional Assay.

Peptide-oligourea hybrid design started with GLP-1-NH2 and the introduction of a glycine in position 2 of GLP-1 instead of alanine (GLP-1-G2, Compound 1 and SEQ ID NO. 1) as it is known to prevent DPP-4 degradation.31-33 We then identified the amount of consecutive amino acid residues that can be replaced by ureido units. This aspect was important considering GLP-1 has key interactions with GLP-1R at both end of the peptide.27,30 If an oligourea portion placed in the middle of the peptide induced a torsion or an elongation that is not exactly the same as the polypeptide it replaces, a drastic negative impact on the affinity would be expected. We thus decided to start our investigation by replacing four consecutive amino acids (X4) with three consecutive ureido residues (Xu3) based on our model suggesting that this combination gives the best overlaps of the terminal atoms (FIGS. 2A-2C). It is noteworthy that the diameter of the triad helix turn is slightly larger than the peptide α-helix turn and it should be taken into account when designing hybrids.

Next, we turned our attention to the side chains of the removed tetrapeptide. Our model suggested that the projection of the side chains of Xu residues would not be the same as the native X residues they replaced (FIG. 2B). Indeed, examination of the model suggested that the side chain of Xu1 did not project in the same direction as in X1. However, it suggested that a ureido residue with its side chain shifted to the second backbone methylene (i.e. α-C)18 would give a similar projection. The second side chain (Xu2) gave the best fit with the corresponding α-amino acid side chain (X2) based on this model. On the other hand, the third amino acid side chain seemed to be the least imitable as it is superimposed with a urea nitrogen of the third ureido residue Xu3. However, our model also suggested that this third ureido residue could mimic the fourth amino acid residue (X4) by changing the substitution pattern (shift to the second methylene-α-C). Overall, our model suggested that mimicking the precise projection of α-amino acid side chains was possible although not necessary trivial.

Considering the relative difficulty to select the most appropriate side chains in ureido units to mimic a given tetrapeptide segment with high fidelity, we thus decided to start with an Alau triad (AuAuAu) scan for simplification. The objective was to avoid any negative impact of the amino urea side chains on the potency so the observed activity would correlate the loss of affinity predicted from the Ala scan (FIG. 3).48,49 A lower activity than predicted would mean a negative impact coming from the backbone modification. In our first round of syntheses, the known helical portion of GLP-1 spanning residues 9 to 31 was scanned with Ala′ triads (AuAuAu). We avoided however to synthesise hybrids lacking D9 or F22, considering that these amino acids are requisite for potency (Table 1). All compounds were synthesized using standard solid phase synthesis techniques and μwave assistance.22

The agonistic activity of these hybrids were obtained by functional assays using cells expressing the GLP-1R and by measuring the receptor-mediated cAMP produced (see supporting information). As expected, GLP-1-G2 (1) was 2.5 times less potent than GLP-1, with still a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.24 nM. Interestingly, many hybrids from the Alau triad scan proved to be potent, demonstrating the good overlaps of the oligourea backbone with the peptide backbone. The most active hybrids were selected and native side chains were introduced in the oligourea triads in new rounds of synthesis with focus on recovering the most important side chain interactions: D9, Y13, E15, F22, and 123. Table 1 shows a selection of the most representative results obtained in this study. Interestingly, in most cases the reintroduction of the native side chains improved the potency of the GLP-1-oligourea hybrids. GG2[YuEuAu]14-17 (9) even gave a better affinity (0.18 nM) than the native peptide 1 (0.24 nM). It is noteworthy that hybrids GG2[DuαAuAu]9-12 (2, 13 nM) and GG2[FuαIuAu]22-25 (16, 62 nM) which contain native side chains and shifted substitution pattern still preserve substantial affinity with GLP-1R, although with over a hundred fold loss compared to the native peptide. Nevertheless, considering the importance of the modifications, the mere observation that oligourea triads can mimic those capital interactions is remarkable. We also investigated the possibility to introduce two successive triads by synthesizing compound GG2[YuEuAuAuAuAu]14-21 (23), which comes from the combination of 9 (0.18 nM) and 14 (4.1 nM). We were delighted to find that 23 was still active (3.4 nM) with a similar potency to 14, considering that 25% of the GLP-1 sequence was replaced by oligoureas.

Enzymatic and Mouse Plasma Degradation Studies.

Having in hands active hybrids, we then turn our attention to their stability toward proteolysis. Since homooligoureas are fully resistant to proteases,20 improved proteolytic protection was expected for hybrids compare to their native peptide 1. As mentioned above, the two main identified proteases for the degradation of GLP-1 in vivo are DPP-4 and NEP-24.11. As the glycine in position 2 of our analogues prevents the specific DDP-4 cleavage between residues 2 and 3, our attention was turned toward the later. NEP 24.11 (Neutral endopeptidase 24.11, also known as Neprilysin, CD10, MME, and CALLA) is an unspecific membrane protease that quickly cleaves GLP-1 at multiple sites.35 It was showed that a GLP-1 analogue with improved half-life in a NEP 24.11 degradation assay had prolonged action in mice, therefore making this assay relevant to evaluate the potential efficacy in vivo of our compounds.40 In addition to NEP 24.11, mouse plasma was also utilized to assess the stability or our compounds.

The half-lives of compounds 1, 2, 5, 9, 11, 14, 16, 22, and 23 in presence of NEP 24.11 and in presence of mouse plasma were determined by following the decay of the analogues by LCMS (Table 2). In the NEP 24.11 degradation assay, the native peptide 2 had a half-life of 3.6 h and unfortunately the hybrids 5, 9, and 16 showed diminished half-lives of 2.9 h, 3.0 h and 1.8 h respectively. Although these t1/2 values were not significantly different from the t1/2 of peptide 1 (3.6 h), statistical significance was obtained at the 4 h time point for these three hybrids demonstrating their lower stability (FIG. 32). Those results were intriguing, as we did not expect lower proteolytic protection for some hybrids. Further investigations showed no indication that the cleavage sites for the destabilized hybrids were located in or next to the oligourea triads making it more puzzling. Nevertheless, in two cases (22,23) the permutation of 4 amino acids for an oligourea triad improved significantly the proteolytic protection of the hybrids (Table 2 and FIG. 32). It is also noteworthy that the analogue 23 where 8 amino acids were replaced by 2 triads had a significant increase of its half-life.

In mouse plasma degradation assay, the native peptide 1 had a half-life of 16 min and hybrids 2, 5, and 9 had similar t1/2 of 17, 23 and 17 min respectively. Interestingly, hybrids 11, 14, 16, 22, and 23 had significantly longer half-lives. In the case of 22, a half-life of >60 min was observed, which represents over 3.8-folds improvement compared to peptide 1. Over the eight hybrids selected, five had improved stability in mouse plasma with the insertion of the triad at various positions on the peptide. The proteolytic stability to NEP 24.11 could predict mostly the results in mouse plasma. The next step was to investigate if these improvements in half-lives could be transposed in vivo.

In vivo studies. Although improving the proteolytic protection or the plasmatic stability of some hybrids represented a significant milestone, the most important question remained: are those improvements reflected in vivo? To answer this important question we conducted three sets of studies.

In the first study, we evaluated the effect of the analogues on the blood glucose concentration of normal mice (FIG. 4). The fed mice were treated with the analogues and their blood glucose concentration was monitored before and after dosing for 6 h. The native peptide GLP-1-G2 (1) showed a decreased of blood glucose concentration after 30 min, proving its efficacy in vivo, although for a short time as a rapid raise to the initial concentration level is observed after 1 h. Hybrids 5 and 9 showed efficacy but no improvement, indicated by a similar blood glucose curve to peptide 1 (FIG. 4A). Hybrids 2, 11, and 16 showed no activity (FIG. 4B) since no initial drop in blood glucose concentration was observed and the curves resembled the vehicle one. Most interestingly, hybrids 14, 22, and 23 showed an improved efficacy compare to the native peptide 1 (FIG. 4C). Indeed, a decrease of blood glucose concentration is observed after 30 min and the effect is preserved for 4 h after dosing.

These results were well predicted by the plasma stability of the hybrids as all the compounds (2, 5, and 9) with similar plasma stability to peptide 1 gave comparable results in vivo. The compounds with lower potencies 2 (2%) and 16 (0.4%) showed no effect after 30 min and were therefore less effective than peptide 1 (100%), although 16 had longer half-life in plasma (16 vs 38 min). This indicates that passing a certain threshold, the potency is just not good enough to produce an observable effect. In the case of hybrid 11, no effect was observed on the blood glucose after 30 min of the injection. These results were more difficult to explain as the mouse plasma half-life of 11 is prolonged (31 min) and the potency (13%) is comparable to 14 (6%), 22 (19%) and 23 (7%). As expected, the three best compounds in vivo, 14, 22, and 23, had all (1) improved stability in NEP 24.11 degradation assays, (2) prolonged half-lives in mouse plasma and (3) decent potency. This is noteworthy as these analogues are at least 10-fold less potent then GLP-1-G2 (2), meaning that even if at least 10 times more compound is required to get the same activity in vitro, they have a significant longer acting period. Interestingly, the analogue 24 with six consecutive ureido residues proved to be efficient despite its 7% potency compared to GLP-1-G2 (2).

In order to validate our results that the pharmaceutical properties of peptide 2 can be improved by substituting amino acids with oligourea triads, we conducted a series of IPGTT studies on the three best hybrids 14, 22, and 23 with peptide 1 as control (FIGS. 5A1, 5A2, 5B1, 5B2, 5C1, 5C2, 5D1, and 5D2). In the first study, fasted healthy mice were submitted to an intra peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) 5 min after dosing 1 and 14 in order to validate the activity of the reference peptide 1. As expected both analogues were active, although 1 had a slightly higher AUC (FIGS. 5A1 and 5A2). Indeed, after 60 min of the glucose challenge, and therefore 65 min after dosing, 1 showed no more significant effect compare to the vehicle while 14 was still active, as expected from the blood glucose study (FIG. 4B). In a second study, an IPGTT was performed 30 min after i.v. injections of 1, 14 and the vehicle (FIGS. 5B1 and 5B2). An effect was observed at T0 before the glucose challenge but already after 30 min (60 min after dosing) there was no significant effect on the blood glucose for peptide 1 in agreement with previous IPGTT study. So when performing an IPGTT after 30 min of the dosing, the native peptide 1 was already inactive while hybrid 14 demonstrated full activity as predicted again from the blood glucose study. A further IPGTT study was done with a glucose challenge after 2 h of the dosing to investigate the prolong activity of hybrids 14, 22, and 23 (FIGS. 5C1 and 5C2). The native peptide 1 had an IPGTT curve similar to the vehicle as expected from previous studies. In contrast, the curve of hybrids 14, 22, and 23 showed a good control of the blood glucose concentration during the IPGTT which is reflected in the AUC. An IPGTT was then performed after 4 h of dosing with compounds 1, 14, and 22 (FIGS. 5D1 and 5D2). Almost no rise in the blood glucose was observed at 30 min post glucose challenge and the effect continued up to 120 min showing that hybrids 14 and 22 are still active after 6 h of the treatment.

To gain additional insight into the pharmacological consequences of modifying the peptide backbone with oligourea triads, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study with 1 and 22. In good agreement with the mouse plasma study and the pharmacodynamics data, hybrid 23 had a longer half-life compared to peptide 1 (FIG. 6) presumably because it has a better proteolytic stability, although other factors might be involved. The NEP study probably indicates the trend while not being the actual enzyme that determines the in vivo half-life of our analogues. All in all, these results clearly show that the activity of peptide 1 in vivo can be prolonged using the oligoureas triads strategy by improving its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties.

With that proof of concept in hand, we then investigated the possibility of combining the peptide/oligourea hybrid approach with the protraction strategy, which consists of functionalizing a peptide with a fatty acid chain to promote its binding to albumin and prolong its in vivo half-life. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with an 2-aminoisobutyric (Aib) in position 2 and a C18 chain linked to K20 through a small PEG spacer which was accepted by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of diabetes as a once weekly treatment and is presently in phase 3 clinical trial for a once daily oral treatment.50,51 We synthesized hybrid 24 which is a semaglutide analogue with an oligourea fragment replacing the four last amino acids (semaglutide-[AuAuAu]28-31) like in hybrid 22. In vitro (cAMP production functional assay), hybrid 24 was found to be equally potent to semaglutide (FIGS. 27A and 27B). The pharmacodynamics properties of 24 were next assessed in a study on db/db mice using FDA approved exenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide as positive controls. A single dose of analogues or placebo was injected intra peritoneal and the blood glucose was followed over time. After 48 h, hybrid 24 and semaglutide (25) were still active while exenatide and liraglutide showed no more significant activity. Although hybrid 24 and semaglutide (25) showed similar activities in vitro and in vivo (FIGS. 38A-38C), it is noteworthy that hybrid 24 displays a longer half-life than semaglutide in mouse plasma (160 vs 11 h, FIGS. 34A-34C) and pancreatin (3.2 vs 0.63 h, FIGS. 38C and 35A-35C). Because pancreatin degradation assays are relevant to predict the stability of peptides in the gastrointestinal tract,52 our data thus suggest that hybrid 24 could be suitable for oral administration and the peptide/oligourea hybrid approach reported here could be used to improve oral delivery of some peptide-based drugs.

In summary, a new and simple approach to modify and modulate the properties of bioactive peptide helices using small foldamer inserts was developed. It consists of replacing 4 consecutive amino acid residues in the sequence of an α-helical peptide by an α-helicomimetic oligourea segment of 3 residues to generate the analogous peptide-oligourea hybrid. Here, the method was applied in a systematic fashion to the 31 amino acid peptide GLP-1 to generate a series of GLP-1-oligourea hybrids among which potent agonists of GLP-1R were identified. Agonists of GLP-1R have proved to be potent treatment against type 2 diabetes mellitus and are promising for other indications such as obesity, NASH, and Alzheimer's disease. It is noteworthy that three hybrids out of the eight tested in mice had significantly prolonged duration of action. This prolonged effect was correlated with both NEP 24.11 and mouse plasma degradation studies, suggesting an increased stabilization towards other peptidases present in the organism. The strategy was then applied to semaglutide, a FDA approved GLP-1 analogue, to generate hybrid 24 and we showed that not only the in vivo activity was preserved, but the stability toward pancreatin was improved opening the way for improvement in oral administration. Overall, this study shows that replacing 4 consecutive amino acid residues with an ureido triad of similar dimension and geometry in a peptide α-helix is a good strategy to improve its pharmaceutical properties. We expect this approach to be useful for the development of new peptide therapeutics and we are currently evaluating its generalization to other peptide sequences and protein targets of therapeutic interest.

Synthesis of Exemplary Oligoureas

Synthesis of GLP-1 Analogues.

Compounds 1 to 24 were synthesized using solid-phase synthesis starting from Sieber amide resin (160 mg, loading 0.62 mmol/g). The synthesis were conducted with microwave irradiation using the Liberty Blue™ microwave peptide synthesizer from CEM S.A.S. N-Fmoc-α amino acid (5 equiv) were coupled with PyBOP (5 equiv) and DIEA (10 equiv) as coupling reagent using the standard Liberty Blue™ methods. The N-Fmoc protecting group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF (3 mL) also with the standard methods. Each activated monomer (3 equiv) was coupled twice using DIEA (10 equiv) under microwave irradiation (70° C., 50 W, 20 min) in DMF (4 mL). The reduction of the azido group was performed twice in a mixture of 1,4-dioxane/H2O (7:3 v/v) (5 mL) with a 1 M PMe3 solution in THF (10 equiv) under microwave irradiation (50° C., 50 W, 30 min). See supplementary data for the remaining steps of the synthesis of 24. After completion of the synthesis, the resin was transferred into a syringe with a frit, and washed three times with DMF, three times with CH2Cl2 and three times with Et2O. Cleavage from the resin was performed using 95% TFA with 2.5% triisopropylsilane and 2.5% water (3 mL). After 2 h the resin was filtered and discarded. Diethyl ether was added to precipitate the oligomer and the solid was triturated and filtrated. Semi preparative purification of all compound was performed by HPLC using a C18ec column (10×250 mm, 5 μm).

In Vitro Pharmacology (EC50).

Evaluation of the agonist activity of compounds 1-23 at the mouse GLP-1 receptor endogenously expressed in βTC6 cells, was determined by measuring their effects on cAMP production using the HTRF detection method (performed by Cerep S. A.). The cells were suspended in HBSS buffer (Invitrogen) complemented with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 500 μM IBMX, then distributed in microplates at a density of 1.5×104 cells/well and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of HBSS (basal control), the test compound or the reference agonist. Following incubation, the cells were lysed and the fluorescence acceptor (D2-labeled cAMP) and fluorescence donor (anti-cAMP antibody labeled with europium cryptate) were added. After 60 min at room temperature, the fluorescence transfer was measured at λex=337 nm and λem=620 nm and 665 nm using a microplate reader (Rubystar, BMG). The cAMP concentration was determined by dividing the signal measured at 665 nm by that measured at 620 nm (ratio). The results are expressed as a percent of the control response to 10 nM GLP-1. The standard reference agonist is GLP-1, which is tested in each experiment at several concentrations to generate a concentration-response curve from which its EC50 value and SE is calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Enzymatic Degradation (NEP 24.11).

Stock solutions of the oligomers were prepared at a concentration of 400 μM in a solution of 50 mM HEPES buffer, 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-80, pH 8.0. Stock solution of NEP 24.11 was prepared at a concentration of 100 μg/mL in water. Stability of oligomers to NEP 24.11 was assessed by conducting protease reaction in a 96-well plates at 20° C. To each well was added 2 μL of HEPES buffer, 38 μL of the solution of oligomer to be assayed (final concentration 304 μmol/L) and 10 μL of the solution of enzyme (final concentration 20 μg/mL) for a total volume of 50 μL. Each compound was also incubated in the absence of the enzyme (12 μL of HEPES buffer and 38 μL of oligomer). At the indicated time (1, 2, 4, 6 and 22 hours) an aliquot of 10 μL was removed from each experimental reaction and pipetting into 100 μL of 1% TFA solution to quench the reaction. (t=0 min was determined using the reaction without enzyme). A portion of the quenched reaction solution was analyzed by HPLC. The time course of peptide degradation was determined by integrating the area of each peak in a series of HPLC traces.

Enzymatic Degradation (Pancreatin).

Stock solutions of the oligomers were prepared at a concentration of 250 μM in DMSO.

In Vitro Pharmacology (EC50)—Second Method

Evaluation of the agonist activity of hybrid 24 and semaglutide (25) at the human GLP-1 receptor exogenously expressed in HEK293T cells, was determined by measuring their effects on cAMP production using the HTRF detection method (performed by Ureka). The cells were suspended in cell culture media (DMEM 1×+GlutaMAX (Gibco 31966-021)) complemented with FBS 10% (Sigma Aldrich F7524), Pen/Strep 1% (Sigma Aldrich P4333) and 500 μM IBMX, then distributed in 384-well microplates at a density of 1.0×104 cells/well (35 μL). Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared at a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO. Then, Compounds to be tested were diluted in assay buffer and a 35 μL aliquot transferred to the plate containing the cells to reach final assay concentrations of 1*10−14-1*10−7 M. The plate was incubated for 15 min at 5% CO2 at 37° C. Following incubation, the cells were lysed and the fluorescence acceptor (D2-labeled cAMP) and fluorescence donor (anti-cAMP antibody labeled with europium cryptate) were added. After 120 min at room temperature, the fluorescence transfer was measured at λex=337 nm and λem=620 nm and 665 nm using a microplate reader (F500 Tecan). The cAMP concentration was determined by dividing the signal measured at 665 nm by that measured at 620 nm (ratio). The results are expressed as a percent of the control response to 10 nM Forskolin. The standard reference agonist is GLP-1-G2-NH2, which is tested in each experiment at several concentrations to generate a concentration-response curve from which its EC50 value and SEM is calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Thus, the experimental results demonstrate that peptide-oligourea chimeric foldamers (compounds having a polypeptide portion contiguous with or linked to oligomers of amino acids having an N, N′-linked urea bridging unit) demonstrate enhanced or improved properties relative to the parental or cognate “natural” peptide. Oligoureas can be derived from building blocks with any desired amino acid side chain. In particular, the chimeric compounds as described herein demonstrate regular and persistent helical conformations and improved helix stability. Because the chimeric foldamers as described herein can adopt desired secondary structures similar to native peptides, including, e.g., linear, cyclic or helicoidal structures, they can serve as, for example, receptor ligands, effector molecules, agonists, antagonists, modulators of protein-protein interactions, organocatalysts or enzymes.
