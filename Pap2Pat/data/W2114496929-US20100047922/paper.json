    "abstract": "Background:\u00a0A new particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) with avian antibodies for measuring serum/plasma cystatin C has been developed. The performance characteristics of the assay are described.\u00a0Methods:\u00a0Measurements were performed on a Roche Modular P and on an Abbott Architect ci8200 using Gentian cystatin C immunoassay. Results:\u00a0Measuring range was 0.3\u20138.0 mg/L. Reference range was 0.57\u20131.09 mg/L. Total analysis time was 10 minutes. Linearity was absolute over the whole assay range. Recovery of samples and controls was within 98.6\u2013109.4%. Total imparticle enhanced nephelometric cystatin C immunoassay (PENIA) by linear regression resulted in a slope within 0.97\u20131.02 and intercept within \u00b10.05 mg/L. Interference studies with drugs, anticoagulants, intralipid ( 11g/L), triglycerides ( 14 g/L) and bilirubin (420mg/L) antibodies, no interference with rheumatoid factor was observed. No carry-over was 6%) were both below 0.33 mg/L, which is less than the lowest standard. Sample stability was up to one month at 2\u20138\u00b0C. Stability of the reagents at 2\u20138\u00b0C was estimated to be 24 months. Stability of the reagents in use was minimum 9 weeks. Conclusions:\u00a0Gentian cystatin C PETIA is shown to have excellent performance between methods. Interference results are improved due to avian antibodies and a broader span of the calibration curve. Avian antibodies are also known to have better immune response than mammalian antibodies towards mammalian antigens.",

Serum/plasma creatinine has become the most common marker for GFR as glomerulus and not reabsorbed by the proximal tubules. The concentration of SCr in the bloodstream depends on variables as muscle mass, age, diet and gender. With increased plasma concentrations, there is increased tubular secretion, leading to an overestimation of GFR in patients with moderate and severe decreases in GFR. SCr is also insensitive for detecting small decreases in GFR. Even a 50% reduction of GFR is not infrequently associated with a normal serum creatinine concentration [1]."

The protein is 13kDa and is almost ellipsoidal (30 and 45 \u00c5). It has a pI lus. It is reabsorbed by tubular epithelial cells and 99% is catabolized.

                "Since 1981, Cystatin C has been widely discussed as a marker for GFR. This study shows that the new cystatin C PETIA (Gentian AS) introduced is comparable in function to both cystatin C PETIA (Dako Cytomation) and PENIA (Dade Behring). This cystatin C PETIA has a strong correlation to the cystatin C PENIA (Dade Behring)(y=0.16+1.01x). The corresponding correlation between existing cystatin C PETIA (Dako Cytomation) and PENIA (Dade Behring) is reported as [25](y=0.15+0.76x). The new cystatin C PETIA (Gentian AS) offers a great advantage by using chicken egg antibodies that eliminates interference with, for example, rheumatoid factor. The new cystatin C PETIA (Gentian AS) has a larger delta absorbance of the calibration curve since absorbance per mg/L of the calibrator is higher than previously published turbidimetric products. This improves precision of the measurements. Moreover, it reduces the interference with lipids since the signal to noise ratio is improved. The new cystatin C PETIA (Gentian AS) is therefore a robust and rapid assay with excellent performance characteristics, enabling routine testing on clinical chemistry platforms."
