    "date": "2006-11-24 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "There is a demand for improved turbidimetric immunoassays for human Cystatin C in biological samples, especially in human clinical samples of body fluids. The present invention provides a turbidimetric immunoassay method and reagent set enabling measurement of human Cystatin C by turbidimetric methods, resulting in a surprisingly stronger and faster turbidimetric signal than in the present state of the art. The increased and faster signal is accomplished by the use of new reagents and compositions, and enables shorter assay times and kinetic reading with a stronger signal, improving overall assay speed and quality. Improved robustness to lipid interference and improved linearity is achieved.",

                        "Cystatin C was discovered and characterized in 1981 by A. Grubb and H. Lovberg [Grubb A O, et al: Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1982; 79]. Cystatin C was the first protein discovered in what later has been named the Cystatin protein superfamily. The Cystatin protein superfamily is a group of proteins that inhibits of cystein protease enzymes. Other biological functions of Cystatin C are presently under investigation. Contrary to other members of the Cystatin superfamily, Cystatin C is present in all body fluids, while the total composition of different Cystatins varies from body fluid to body fluid, and in different compartments [Abrahamson M, et al: J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261:11282]. In 1990, Abrahamsson et al. demonstrated that Cystatin C is produced at a stable rate and by all (or close to all) nucleated cells in the human body, being what is called a \u201chouseholding\u201d protein [Abrahamson M, et al: Biochem. J. 1990; 268:287-94].",
                        "Cystatin C\u2014with a molecular mass of 13 kD\u2014is freely filtered through the normal glomerular membrane of the kidney, but is then reabsorbed and catabolized in the \u201cproximal tubuli\u201d, the compartment of the kidneys that re-absorbs most of the peptides and smaller proteins that pass the glomerular membrane. In this way the kidneys preserve these proteinaceous materials for the body and hinder loss to the urine (Jacobsson B, et al: Histopathology 1995; 26:559-64.) [Heyms S B, et al: Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1983; 37: 478].",
                        "Creatinine, until now the mostly used marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is a small molecular weight molecule produced in muscles cell. The rate of formation and secretion of creatinine is therefore closely linked to the muscular mass of the body. It is well known that the muscular mass of an individual in a population varies considerably. Elderly people often have a low muscular mass compared to the body mass, also many patients lose muscular mass as their diseases progress. Children generally have a different relative muscular mass compared to adults, and men have in average a higher relative muscular mass than women. Therefore, when serum creatinine concentration is used as a marker for glomerular filtration rate, the serum creatinine value can be found within the reference range even when a 50% reduction in glomerular filtration rate has taken place [Shemesh 0, et al: Kidn. Int. 1985; 28: 830-8]. Also diet influences the serum level of creatinine significantly, especially a protein rich diet [Perrone R D, et al: Clin. Chem. 1992; 38:1933-53].",
                        "Serum and plasma creatinine measurements are not reliable, \u201cgold standard methods\u201d for measurement of glomerular filtration rate. The use of intravenous injections of radio labeled substances like Cr-51-EDTA or Tc-99m-DTPA, or injections of iodinated agents like iohexyl, have therefore gained some popularity. These methods are expensive, time-consuming and injections are necessary\u2014and often repeated blood sampling. In the publication \u201cSimple Cystatin C-Based Prediction Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate Compared with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Prediction Equation for Adults and the Scwartz and the Counahan-Barratt Prediction Equations for Children\u201d, by Grubb & al. in Clinical Chemistry 51:8, 1420-1431, it was demonstrated that simple Cystatin C measurements in blood can replace complicated methods of measuring the glomerular filtration rate.",
                        "Cystatin C measurement originally used classical biochemical methods, but soon moved over to turbidimetric and nephelometric immunoassays. The Dade-Behring Company pioneered nephelometric measurement methods. See also Coll, E & al. Am. J. Kidney Disease 2000; 36, 2934. The nephelometric methods are very reliable. The disadvantage of nephelometric methods is that the instruments themselves have rather slow processing speed compared to automated spectrophotometers based on light transmission. Nephelometers produced by Dade Behring, typically the BNII nephelometer and ProSpec nephelometers, and Beckman Instruments, have gained substantial market penetration, but are much less widespread than instruments based on transmission measurements. Nephelometers also have a much lower sample throughput than the large automated instruments based on transmission measurements.",
                        "H. Stone & al. in the article \u201cAnalytical performance of a particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay for serum Cystatin C using rate analysis\u201d, in Clinical Chemistry Vol 8, pp 1482-85, 2001, presented a rate nephelometric method. However, nephelometric instruments have limited capacity for a large number of samples, and the number of nephelometric instruments is limited. Therefore there was a demand to move to absorption spectrophotometric-homogeneous instruments, since such instruments are more abundant and have a higher capacity.",
                        "Dako Cytomation, Denmark, has pioneered the field of turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassays. The state of the art is described in the following articles: \u201cCystatin C\u2014The marker of choice for renal function testing\u201d by C. Schmidt in European Clinical Laboratory, 10 Feb. 2004. \u201cNew improved automated particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay for quantitative determination of human Cystatin C in serum and plasma\u201d by C. Schmidt, C. Kj\u00f8ller and K Gr\u00f8nkjaer, a presentation downloaded from the Dako Cytomation AS' web site July 2005 (incorporated by reference).",
                        "Turbidimetric measurements are\u2014however\u2014disturbed by turbidity in samples, as described in the article \u201cTurbidity in immunoturbidimetric assays\u201d by Dahr & al, in Ann. Clin. Biochem. Vol 27, p. 509, 1990. At the 29th Nordic Congress of Clinical Chemistry, Malmo, Sweden, 24-27 April, 2004, A. Grubb presented results on interference from triglycerides in serum and plasma samples on the results from Cystatin C measurements. There is therefore still a need for improvements on the turbidimetric immunoassay for human Cystatin C.",
                        "An alternative to homogeneous immunoassay systems would be a separation-based non-homogeneous immunoassay systems. The advantage of non-homogeneous immunoassay systems is characterized by a separation step with washing during the performance of the assay. The advantage of these systems is that they\u2014by means of the washing\u2014remove any interfering substances. Furthermore, it allows washing away non-bound antibodies and non-bound enzymes or fluorescent or colored or other signal-giving moieties. These methods are generally non-competitive since the substance to be measured\u2014hereinafter called the analyte\u2014does not have to compete with labeled analogues for the binding to the antibodies. This aspect, and the use of washing steps, makes it possible to use immobilized antibodies and labeled antibodies in excess, rendering a high sensitivity and usually a high level of accuracy, especially if high quality antibodies are used.",
                        "There are numerous textbooks on solid phase and other non-homogeneous immunoassay systems. Big automated systems are commercially available. Abbott Diagnostic Division, US, sells reagents for ImX, AxSYM and other automated non-homogeneous immunoassay instruments; Roche Diagnostics, Germany, sells reagents for Elecsys and other non-homogeneous immunoassay systems; and there are numerous other suppliers of non-homogeneous immunoassay systems and reagents. A still very popular non-homogeneous immunoassay system is the so-called microtitre immunoassay systems. These systems are slow but reliable and inexpensive. The general immunoassay literature gives a lot of information on these systems, which are well known to those skilled in the art.",
                        "The disadvantage of non-homogeneous immunoassay systems is the lack of capacity for a high number of assays per time unit, i.e. per hour running time. The methods involve separation and washing steps, which\u2014although automated\u2014occupy instrument running time. Furthermore, since solid phases are involved, special devices or solid phases are often used, which have a certain production price, even when mass-produced. High through-put and speed of result generation have become more and more important in recent years, due to the ever increasing number of tests to run. There is a demand to move assays from non-homogeneous, often solid phase based, immunoassay technologies, to homogeneous immunoassay systems.",
                        "Homogeneous immunoassay systems are simple in construction and have a higher throughput capacity. The reagents are mixed, incubated and measured, either during or after incubation. Endpoint signals or differences in signal between different time points or continuous kinetic measurements are used. Signals may be measurements of fluorescence, color or opacity (turbidimetry). In particular, large automated instruments for measurements of color and/or opacity/turbidimetry have been very successful. The Hitachi Company in Japan pioneered this large-scale automation, working together with Roche, but also numerous other manufacturers including Olympus and Bayer supply such instruments and reagents. These instruments are automated multi-well spectrophotometers measuring transmission of light through a mixture of the sample and reagents at different wavelengths and at different time points. Since the turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassays run on such homogeneous high capacity instruments, this is another reason why high quality turbidimetric Cystatin C assays are in demand.",
                        "Most homogeneous immunoassay systems are based on mixing the sample with reagent solutions comprising a well-controlled concentration of labeled analyte or analyte analogue, and antibodies having specific affinity for the analyte. The analyte molecules in the sample compete with the labeled analyte or analyte analogue, and a signal is generated. The vast immunoassay literature teaches the use of different labels and analogues. Here it should be noted that\u2014so far\u2014there has been limited success using homogeneous immunoassay methods for high molecular weight analytes (molecular mass above 4000) generating colored signals. (There has been success using fluorescent techniques, e.g. proximity assays, but there are not many high throughput automated fluorometers available, and therefore these technologies do not serve the purpose of the present invention). The EMIT technology from Syva and the CDEIA technology from Microgenics, both companies located in California, have been successful with color signals in homogeneous immunoassays for low molecular mass analytes. For high molecular mass analytes, particle enhanced turbidimetric measurements have been the most successful technology for the automated multi-well spectrophotometers measuring transmission of light through the mixture of the sample and the reagents. Turbidimetric methods are therefore preferred for higher molecular weight analytes. General descriptions of turbidimetric methods are found in numerous immunoassay textbooks.",
                        "Why are high precision measurements of Cystatin C necessary? From the perspective of biology, the literature on the biology of Cystatin C and creatinine, as well as the meta-analysis cited above, point in the direction of the use of Cystatin C instead of creatinine to monitor and diagnose reduced glomerular filtration rate. However, although the biological argument is in favour of using Cystatin C, the biological advantage is only of importance if the accuracy and precision of the Cystatin C analysis is good. The accuracy and precision of creatinine measurements is excellent, and the medical advantage of analyzing Cystatin C instead of creatinine is easily lost if the accuracy or precision of the Cystatin C immunoassay methods is too low.",
                        "A problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an immuno-turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassay with improved accuracy and/or precision and/or less interference from lipids and hemoglobin in test sample if compared to corresponding commercially available turbidimetric assays.",
                        "Another drawback of the prior art of turbidimetric measurements of Cystatin C is the low rate of change in turbidimetry, which leads to long assay time and/or high imprecision. A further problem to be solved by the present invention is therefore, to provide a faster turbidimetric measurements of Cystatin C."

Said method of the invention particularly makes use of improved nanoparticle-immunoconjugates which allow a more rapid and/or more sensitive and/or more reliable Cystatin C measurement under different experimental conditions, as in particular, different Cystatin C concentrations, different measuring wavelengths, different reaction times and different temperatures. Further advantages of the invention are evident form the attached experiments.",

Also the assay time could be reduced.",

                                "b1) Polyclonal Antibodies",
                                "Polyclonal anti human Cystatin C antibodies can be prepared by methods well known in the art, such as those described for example by Chase, M. W., 1967, in \u201cMethods of Immunology and Immunochemistry\u201d, ed. Williams, A. et al., M. W., pp. 197-209, Academic Press, New York. Briefly, animals of a suitable species (for example rabbits, goats, or sheep, or, preferably avian species, in particular poultry, like hens) are repetitively immunized with purified antigen in an appropriate adjuvant, for example Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant. After immunization the animals are bled and the polyclonal antibodies are purified by methods such as for example ammonium sulfate or ammonium chloride precipitation, anionic exchange chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, and/or affinity chromatography.",
                                "To achieve a sufficient turbidimetric signal, antibodies of high avidity are preferred. Since polyclonal antibodies comprise many different antibody molecules, an affinity constant cannot be calculated, however high avidity and affinity was obtained by conventional polyclonal antibody techniques. Rabbit antibodies obtained by conventional methods were used, however even better results were obtained with sheep antibodies. Even more better results were obtained when avian antibodies were used. The avian antibodies may be according to the methods described in Larsson A, Baaloew R-M, Lindahl T, and Forsberg P-O in Poultry Science 72:1807-1812, 1993. It is contemplated that the avians being genetically more distinct from humans are able to generate anti-bodies towards human Cystatin C that have a higher avidity than polyclonal mammalian antibodies.",
                                "Polyclonal avian antibodies routinely are obtained from egg yolk (and are therefore designated IgYs). Egg yolk, however, contains large amounts of lipids making their further use problematic. IgY can be isolated from egg yolk by using stepwise ammonium sulphate (for example 25 to 40%) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation.",
                                "For initial purification also commercial IgY purification kits obtainable from Gallus Immunotch Inc, Cary, USA, or the Eggcellent Chicken IgY Purification Kit, obtainable from Pierce, Rockford, USA may also be employed considering the manufacturer's instructions.",
                                "Furthermore, the avidity of polyclonal antibodies may be further increased by using antibodies that ware purified by the use of antigen affinity purification methods, for example according to the teaching in \u201cAffinity Purification of Proteins\u201d downloaded from www.piercenet.com (April 2006) and incorporated by reference Affinity purification is described in more detail below.",
                                "Increased avidity was in particular observed when 20% of the antibodies used had been antigen affinity purified, even more increase was observed when 50% of the antibodies had been antigen affinity purified and even more when more than 75%, like 75 to 100% of the antibodies had been obtained by antigen affinity purification methods.",
                                "For affinity purification of avian polyclonal anti-human Cystatin C antibodies a suitable human Cystatin C affinity column has to be prepared. Purified human Cystatin C is fixed by a standard protocol to a suitable solid supports as for example are Sepharose or Affi-gel, activated to covalently the antigen to the support (suitable activated solid supports are for example available from Pierce, Rockford, USA). An affinity column is then prepared from said antigen-carrying resin.",
                                "Successful affinity purification of antibody depends on effective presentation of the relevant epitopes on the antigen to binding sites of the antibody. If the antigen is small and immobilized directly to a solid support surface by multiple chemical bonds, important epitopes may be blocked or sterically hindered, prohibiting effective antibody binding. Therefore, it is best to immobilize antigens using a unique functional group (e.g., sulfhydryl on a single terminal cysteine in a peptide) and to use an activated support whose reactive groups occur on spacer arms that are several atoms long. For larger antigens, especially those with multiple sites of immobilization, the spacer arm length becomes less important since the antigen itself serves as an effective spacer between the support matrix and the epitope.",
                                "Little variation normally exists among typical binding and elution conditions for affinity purification of antibodies because at the core of each procedure is the affinity of an antibody for its respective antigen. Since antibodies are designed to recognize and bind antigens tightly under physiologic conditions, most affinity purification procedures use binding conditions that mimic physiologic pH and ionic strength. The most common binding buffers are phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and Tris buffered saline (TBS) at pH 7.2 and 1.5 M NaCl (premixed buffer packs are for example available from Pierce, Rockford, USA). Once the antibody has been bound to an immobilized antigen, additional binding buffer is used to wash unbound material from the support. To minimize non-specific binding, the wash buffer may contain additional salt or detergent to disrupt any weak interactions.",
                                "Specific, purified antibodies are eluted from an affinity resin by altering the pH and/or ionic strength of the buffer (common elution buffers are for example available from Pierce, Rockford, USA). Antibodies in general are resilient proteins that tolerate a range of pH from 2.5 to 11.5 with minimal loss of activity, and this is by far the most common elution strategy. In some cases an antibody-antigen interaction is not efficiently disrupted by pH changes or is damaged by the pH, requiring that an alternate strategy be employed.",
                                "An example for an affinity purification protocol is given below:",
                                "Step 1: Wash the column (\u22121 ml resin bed) to remove residual protein before each use using 10 column volumes of the following sequence of buffers:\n\n0.2 M glycine, pH 2.8\u02dc10 ml",

                                "Step 2: Add to 10 ml aliquot of crude antibody preparation, 1 ml 10\u00d7TTBS and 0.55 ml 4 M NaCl. Centrifuge the mixture to remove any precipitate.\n\nStep 3: Absorb the antibody batchwise by transferring the affinity resin to the tube (a 15 ml tube) with the serum. Incubate in the cold room. Alternatively, one can apply the serum to the column using a slow flow rate. Manually collected fractions are obtained. Collect the phase that passes through the column and re-apply it a second time using a slow flow rate.\n\nStep 4: Wash the column extensively with TTBS+NaCl to 0.5 M until the A280 is less than 0.02. Collect 10 ml fractions of the washes and check the A280 of the fractions.\n\nStep 5: Elute the antibody using 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.8, containing 0.02% NaN3. Elute using 1 ml aliquots of buffer. Collect fractions into 1.5 ml microfuge tube containing 50 ml 1 M Tris, pH 8.5. This neutralizes the acidic elution buffer soon after the protein is eluted. Collect at least 10 fractions.

                                "Polyclonal antibodies are often more preferred than monoclonal antibodies in particle-enhanced turbidimetric assays. Polyclonal antibodies are inherently reactive to many different epitopes on the antigens (or analytes) (contrary to monoclonals), and therefore more easily create cross-bindings and networks between the antigens molecules per se, and between the antigens and the particles to which the antibodies are immobilized. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies generally bind to one type of epitopes only, which makes it more difficult to form cross-bindings and networks. The diagnostic industry often prefers, however, the use of monoclonal antibodies, because they are easier to standardized and to quality control to a predefined standard, especially over a product life-time of many years. There are, therefore, good examples on the use of monoclonal antibodies for particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassays, especially when there are antigenic characteristics favoring the use of monoclonal antibodies. Eda & al. in \u201cDevelopment of a New Microparticle-Enhanced Turbidimetric Assay for C-reactive protein With Superior features in Analytical Sensitivity and Dynamic range\u201d, J. Clin. Lab. Analysis, 12: 137-144 (1998) describes the use of two different monoclonal antibodies and two different micro particles. CRP is especially favourable for the use of monoclonals, because the CRP molecule is a pentamer of identical subunits\u2014and therefore carries five replicates of all epitopes (Pepys M B & al, Adv. Immunol. 34:141-212 (1983)), which makes the use of monoclonal antibodies much easier. However, also with monomeric and smaller proteins like Cystatin C, cocktails of different monoclonal antibodies may be used in special embodiments of the present inventions. Cocktails of different monoclonal antibodies, especially when they are composed of many different monoclonal antibodies with high affinity to Cystatin C, will result in good embodiments of the present invention of Cystatin C immunoassays.",

Kennet et al., Plenum press, New York & London. Spleen cells or peripheral blood cells from immunized mice or rats are fused with a myeloma cell line, using for instance the polyethylene fusion method. After fusion the cells are grown under suitable conditions, for example on culture plates and a selection of correctly fused cells is performed using for example the hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) selection method. Antibody producing cell lines are identified by methods such as EIAs, RIAs or agglutination assays. After identification of the antibody producing cell line, the cells are repeatedly subcloned, as for example by the method of limited dilution, to guarantee that the new growing cell line derives from one single cell.",

The DNA of the antigen-binding site from a monoclonal antibody of one species or parts thereof are transferred to the DNA of the antibody framework of another antibody of a different species. This new construct is cloned into an expression vector, which is transferred to the corresponding expression system to produce the antibody.",

After generating calibration curves of the nanoparticle reagent under the same conditions, the steepness of the resulting calibration curves for low concentrations of analyte gives a first indication of the reactivity of the immunological binding partners.",
                                "When using polyclonal antibodies as binding partners, the preparation of high and low reactivity polyclonal antibodies may be performed according to methods well known in the art by introducing the polyclonal antibodies into an affinity chromatography column, carrying the antigenic analyte covalently bound to the gel matrix. With a gradient of elution buffer low reactivity polyclonal antibody fractions will elute first from the column, followed by fractions with increasingly higher reactivity. (see S. Yamamoto et al., 1993, \u201cVeterinary Immunology and Immunopathology\u201d 36, 257-264, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam). Reactivity of the fractions can then be checked either with a BIAcore instrument or by coating them independently onto nanoparticles of the same size and material and generating the corresponding calibration curves.",

If appropriate, mixtures of different anti human Cystatin C antibodies differing with respect to their affinity/avidity vis-\u00e0-vis human Cystatin C may be used for preparing nanoparticle-antibody conjugates of the present invention. Suitable mixing ratios can be determined by a skilled person by a limited series of experiments.",

For example, coupling may be achieved by means of particles carrying on their surface carboxyl-, amino-, hydroxyl-, hydrazide- or chloromethyl groups. The molecule to be coupled may either react directly with such groups or by means of a suitable linker, as for example carbodiimides, glutaraldehyde, or cyanogen bromide.",
                                "The shell of the particles according to this invention preferably has to comprise antibodies with high affinities for Cystatin C, combined with a nanoparticle core of a certain size to generate a sufficient turbidimetric signal. Typically the nanoparticles comprising the shell of proteinaceous material is between 58 and 200 nm, more preferred between 65 and 150 nm, and even more preferred between 80 and 135 nm.",
                                "In a particular embodiment of the invention the mean diameter of non-coated particles is about 80 nm. Using these particles, after coating they are typically 90-100 nanometers in diameter. As a general rule a monolayer of antibodies is about 5 nm thick, so that such particles are considered to carry a monolayer of antibodies.",
                                "These particles will have good performance when 5 to 35% of the total dry weight of the conjugated particles is constituted by antibodies, better performance at 10 to 30%, and optimum performance when 15 to 25% of the total dry weight of the conjugated particles is constituted by antibodies.",
                                "If slightly larger particles are used, these optimal percentage values go down. By way of example, if 95 nm naked particles are used, they typically end up being 110 nm in median diameter if coated. The corresponding percentages are then 4 to 32%, 8 to 26%, and, for optimum performance, 12 to 22% (percentage of the total dry weight of the conjugated particles constituted by antibodies). However, with these slightly larger particles, more particles (in the meaning more weight of particles) has to be used in the assay to have enough binding capacity to create a calibration curve without a flattening of the curve at higher concentration of Cystatin C (the assay calibration curve must have a good dynamic range up to over 8 \u03bcg Cystatin C per \u03bcl sample), which leads to a much higher absorption background (larger particles and more particles), and a lower signal to noise ratio.",
                                "On the other hand, smaller particles will have a higher optimum of antibody percentage in the coated immunoparticle. For example, if non-coated particles of a size of 70 nm are used, the median diameter of the coated particles is typically 80 nm, and a proportion of 18 to 30% antibodies of the total dry weight of the conjugated particles will result in optimum percentages, and less optimal are proportions of 12 to 36%, and even less optimal are proportions of 4 to 42% of antibodies. However, with these slightly smaller particles, less particles (in the meaning less weight of particles) has to be used in the assay to create a calibration curve steep enough at lower concentrations, i.e. below 1 \u03bcg Cystatin C per \u03bcl sample, and the signal will be lower and also more vulnerable to background noise.",
                                "Based on the above explanation a skilled reader will be able to provide, guided by the teaching of the present invention, optimum immunoparticle preparations for different assay conditions.",

The inventors have surprisingly observed that optimal results with hydrophilic particles with a high binding capacity is obtained when antibodies are conjugated to the particles together with hydrophilic proteins having \u03bcl values close to the conjugation pH. Best results were obtained when bovine transferrin and albumin were present during the conjugation. However, also other inert proteins may be mixed with the antibodies during conjugation. Non-limiting examples for such hydrophilic, inert proteins are limpet hemocyanin, haptoglobin and other water soluble proteins, without any affinity for the antibodies nor the Cystatin C.",
                                "During the coupling process the conditions are or should be, or if necessary should be adapted to be, such that the antibodies are more reactive with the nanoparticle core material than the inert protein so that they will bind more or less quantitatively to the core. Residual reactive portions of the nanoparticle surface will be blocked by the inert protein.",
                                "The present inventors observed, as general rule, that in a the first step the hydrophobic parts of the antibodies seem to bind physically to the particles, and thus the whole molecule is close to the reactive, as for example chloromethyl, groups on the particle surface, which then reacts with the corresponding, as for example amine, groups of the protein molecule. Due to this physical absorption, the large antibody molecules surprisingly compete well with the smaller, inert hydrophilic proteins like albumin and transferrin. However\u2014since the used less antibodies than the binding capacity of the particles, the inert proteins, like albumins and transferrins, react with whatever is left to react with on the surface of the particles, and then render particles of the present invention, which have a good hydrophilic surface and a good antibody binding capacity at the same time, and an appropriate proportion of nanoparticle material that can generate a good signal.",

                                "In a preferred embodiment, based on the total protein content of the coupling reaction mixture, about 3 to 70 wt.-%, or even more preferred 5 to 40 wt.-% of the protein present during conjugation should be constituted by the anti-Cystatin C antibodies.",
                                "Since the antibodies have, as explained above, a higher binding rate to the particles than the hydrophilic inert proteins, the ratio of antibody protein to total protein bound to the surface of the particles will be much higher; for example from 20 to 90%, and more preferred 35 to 80%, and even more preferred 40 to 70% of the total protein bound to the surface of the particles are constituted by the antibodies."

                                "d1) Advantages of the Invention",
                                "The present invention provides a turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassay with a far stronger signal to noise ratio than in the prior art. By choosing large core and protein shell particles, preferably of a certain minimum size, combined with antigen affinity purified antibodies, a surprisingly high aggregation signal was obtained. A strong turbidimetric signal was obtained due to a surprising synergetic effect between the refractive index of the particles compared to the assay buffer, and the high affinity (or avidity) of the highly purified antibodies. The strong turbidimetric signal led to a higher robustness to interfering substances, e.g. triglycerides, and a better linearity than in the prior art of turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassays.",
                                "The critical factor for a homogeneous immunoassay is the signal generated per mass unit per volume of assay mixture. The assay mixture is the mixture obtained when all reagents and the sample have been added. For example, if a sample of 3 \u03bcl is to be analyzed, and the said sample contains 1 mg/l Cystatin C, and the final volume after mixing all reagents and sample is 300 \u03bcl, the concentration of Cystatin C in the final assay mixture is 10 \u03bcg/l. If the concentration of the analyte in the sample is low, this can often be compensated by using a larger sample compared to the assay mixture volume, e.g. increasing the sample to 6 \u03bcl in an assay mixture volume of 300 \u03bcl. There are several obstacles to increasing the sample volume. Firstly, the concentration of all interfering substances that might be in the sample is increased in the assay mixture. Secondly, the need for antibodies to overcome the critical hook effect (i.e. dose/response curve with negative slope) is increased, which in turn, increases the antibody costs of the assay correspondingly.",
                                "There is therefore a requirement to obtain good signal strength and robust assays at a low assay mixture concentration of the analyte, and a corresponding low sample volume. increasing the sample volume in homogeneous immunoassays leads to more interference and to more expensive assays.",
                                "The present invention provides a surprising increase in signal strength, robustness and linearity of turbidimetric Cystatin C immunoassays. The present invention also has less interference from lipids such as triglycerides. It was accomplished after understanding the shortcomings of the prior art being based on a too-low signal strength in the turbidimetric signal per mass unit of analyte, and provides a methods with better precision, linearity and less interference than the turbidimetric methods in the prior art.",

A preferred sequence of steps is: mixing the sample in the assay buffer, allowing the mixture to fully dissolve and stabilize, and then adding the immunoparticle mixture. The present invention can also be performed by mixing the assay buffer and the immunoparticle suspension first, and then adding and mixing the sample. Optimal mixing methods (selected among methods well known in the art) should be applied, which can be determined by means of a limited number of pre-experiments.",
                                "When a recording photometer is used, the initial rate of the increase of the turbidity can be determined, either by determining the Cystatin C concentration of a sample by measuring the initial rate of the increase of the absorbance, either by direct recording at the time of the mixing, or by recording shortly after the mixing combined with a backwards extrapolation to the initial increase absorbance, or by measuring the absorbance difference between two or more time-points less than 1 minute after the mixing of the sample and the reagents.",
                                "These measurements or combined measurements can be correlated or compared to corresponding results with calibrators of known Cystatin C concentration, and the concentration of unknown samples can thus be calculated. These ways to record absorbance values and to compute results are very well known for numerous other substances to be measured by the skilled man of the art of clinical chemistry. Of course, the very good signal derived from the present invention makes such measurements and calculations much more robust and accurate, especially when good signals shortly after the mixing of the sample and the reagents are obtained as described above.",
                                "There are several assay buffer mixtures that can be used, with different kinds of buffer substances, with different kinds of detergents and/or different kinds of polymers- and/or salts added to the buffer.",
                                "TRIS buffer, phosphate buffer, borate buffer and other buffer substances, like MOPS, PIPES, HEPES can be used, and are not critical to the present invention, as long as the assay can maintain a well regulated pH of the final assay mixture, independent of the pH and the buffering capacity of the sample added. Typically the buffer is added in a final molar proportion of about 5 mM to 0.2 M or 10 mM to 0.1 M. The pH is adjusted in the range of 6 to 8, in particular 6.5 to 7.5.",
                                "Furthermore, several detergents can be used, as long as they are able to dissolve any lipid content of the sample added, and do not interfere too strongly with the antibodies' reaction with Cystatin C introduced with the sample. Triglycerides, cholesterols and a range of lipoproteins are examples of interfering substances in turbidimetric assays, because the lipids form micro droplets and micelles that give interfering signals. Tween 20, Triton X-100 and deoxycholates are examples of suitable detergents. Measuring Cystatin C in lipid-containing samples is a big challenge, and needs good solubility of the lipids, but even more importantly, a strong signal that overrides any minor interference. Detergents are typically added in a final proportion of 0.01 to 0.5%, or 0.1 to 0.3%, each by weight of the final reaction mixture.",
                                "The most widely used polymers are polyethylene glycols of different molecular sizes (in particular of about 6.000 to 8.000), but dextrans and other polymers are can also be used. The polymers have the disadvantage that\u2014when the concentration is too high\u2014they create unspecific precipitation of the other substances introduced when the test sample is mixed into the assay mixture. On the other hand, the said polymers at the same time increase the signal. However, they tend to reduce the overall binding capacity of the immunoparticles. Polymers are typically added in a final proportion of about 0.05 to 0.5% or 0.1 to 0.3%, each by weight of the final reaction mixture.",
                                "Suitable salts to adapt the ionic strength are for example alkali metal halides, in particular sodium chloride, added in a concentration of 1 to 100 mM, or 5 to 50 mM.",

The antibodies conjugated to the nanoparticles can be used in a dry form, e.g. as a pellet, and be dissolved before use, or can be dissolved into the assay buffer reagent or into to reaction mixture. One or more of the components in the reaction buffer can be added in a dry form before or during the performance of the assay, so also the calibrators. Even the samples can be provided in a dried or lyophilized form, and added to the reaction mixture in a dry form, or being dissolved prior to its use.",
                                "In clinical chemistry analysis, the use of standard curves for calibration purposes is standard practice. Thus, in the performance of the method of this invention, samples of known Cystatin C content may be used in the place of clinical samples to construct a standard curve for the response/signal to be measured and the Cystatin C content of the unknown samples may then be calculated by interpolation from the standard curve.",
                                "The total concentration of nanoparticle-immunoconjugates in the mixture will be selected according to methods well known in the art of particle enhanced light scattering immunoassays, so that absorbance values deriving from said nanoparticles do not influence accurate and precise measurements but the microparticle concentration is high enough to get signal development.
