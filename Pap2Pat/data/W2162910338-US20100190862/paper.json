    "title": "Atopic Dermatitis-Like Skin Lesions Reduced by Topical Application and Intraperitoneal Injection of Hirsutenone in NC/Nga Mice",
    "date": "2010-01-01",
    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease. The increasing prevalence and severity of AD have prompted the developments of safer, more effective drugs. Although topical corticosteroids have been used as first line therapy for AD, their potential side effects limit their clinical applications. To investigate the effect of hirsutenone (HIR), a diarylheptanoid compound, on AD-like skin lesions and other factors related to immune response is the aim of this paper Th2-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), eosinophil, IgE inflammatory factors (COX-2, iNOS) levels were reduced in blood, lymphocytes, and tissue after HIR treatment. These results suggest that HIR might be an effective treatment for AD.",

                "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing skin disorder with allergic inflammation. AD is one of the most common skin diseases in children with a family history of atopy and is frequently associated with elevated plasma levels of IgE antibodies against inhaled allergens [1, 2]. The histology of AD is characterized by epidermal alterations and a dermal inflammatory infiltrate containing eosinophils [1]. The causes of atopic dermatitis are not completely understood, but a complex inflammatory immune dysregulation and response to allergens are believed to be involved [2].",
                "The most promising antiatopic dermatitis drugs are compounds that are immune-suppressive. These topical corticosteroids are the primary choice for AD treatment, but their side effects, such as, perioral dermatitis and skin atrophy and striae in sensitive areas, are a major obstacle to their long-term application [3].",
                "Recently, we isolated diarylheptanoid compounds from the bark of Alnus japonica [4]. The bark of Alnus japonica is used in oriental traditional medicine to treat fever, hemorrhage, diarrhea, gastroenteric disorder, lymphatic disease, and cancers [5]. The diarylheptanoids, which are characteristic components of Alnus species, have been reported to have several biological activities. In this study, we investigated HIR, a diarylheptanoid, which has previously been shown to have inhibitory activity on cyclooxygenase-2 expression and anti-inflammatory effects [6\u201312]. Furthermore, HIR has been reported to prevent cytokine and chemokine-mediated immune cell function and inflammatory reaction and was found to be an attractive starting point for the development of a topical drug for T cell-based anti-atopic dermatitis due to its calcineurin inhibitory effects [13, 14].",
                "AD is frequently associated with elevated plasma levels of IgE antibodies against many kinds of inhaled allergens [15, 16]. IgE-mediated mast cell activation leads to the release of various chemical mediators, which results in the infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as, eosinophils and lymphocytes, into skin lesions. Moreover, when promoted by IL-5, IL-4 is able to trigger IgE synthesis and IL-4-dependent IgE synthesis in B cell [17]. In patients with AD, decreased IFN-\u03b3 production is considered to be associated with IgE hypersynthesis and Th2 immune response [18].",
                "In the present study, we induced AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice by repeatedly applying Dermatophagoides farina (House dust) containing cream. We then examined whether HIR has an immune modulating effect in this model and compared this with those of the established therapeutic agents dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone cream (HDC). The efficacies of these test agents were evaluated using clinical skin severity scores, cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) expression in blood and spleen, and total plasma levels of IgE. In an attempt to identify the molecular mode of action of HIR, we also examined its effect on the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS in skin."

Both COX-2 and iNOS expressions were significantly lower in the HIR group, as compared to that of the control group. These results had shown that HIR reduced the expressions of COX-2 and iNOS in the AD-like skin lesions (*P < .05 compared with the PBS group. # P < .05 compared with the base group) (Figure 5)."

                "In this study, we analyzed the therapeutic effect of HIR by applying it topically and injecting to NC/Nga mice with Dermatophagoides farina (House dust) containing cream-induced skin lesions. Although the therapeutic effects of HIR were less than those of HDC, which was used as an active control, topical application, and intraperitoneal injection treatment with HIR significantly reduced AD-like skin lesions and clinical signs provoked by Dermatophagoides farina, such as itching, erythema, excoriation, scaling, and dryness. Furthermore, topical application and intraperitoneal injection of HIR markedly reduced epidermal hyperplasia, eosinophil count, and IgE levels were of AD-like skin lesions. And Th2 cytokine levels and inflammatory factor levels reduced after HIR treatment.",
                "The presence of eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrates of AD has been well established [26]. Previous studies on atopic dermatitis suggest that skin lesions accompanied by topical eosinophilia and systemic IgE elevation are associated with Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). Indeed, the elevated expressions of Th2 cytokines have been confirmed in both acute and chronic lesions of atopic dermatitis as compared with the uninvolved skins of patients with atopic dermatitis or those of normal subjects [27, 28]. It is known that IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are inflammatory cytokines that essential roles in the activation of T cells after antigenic stimulation, and that the skins of AD patients demonstrate Th2 cytokine overexpression, which has been reported to induce atopic responses, such as, itching, lichenification, and chronic inflammation [29].",
                "In our preliminary studies, we found that Dermatophagoides farina-treated NC/Nga mice showed progressive increases in total IgE during experimental period. Furthermore, in a separate experiment, total plasma IgE levels were found to be significantly elevated in Dermatophagoides farina-treated NC/Nga mice (data not shown).",
                "Therefore, we devised an NC/Nga mice skin lesion model by repeatedly applying Dermatophagoides farina to investigate the clinical efficacy and the associated mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect HIR.",
                "Several reports have shown that natural immune modulators in herbal derivatives have therapeutic effects on AD and that HIR reduces the productions of Th1 and Th2 cytokines levels [13, 14, 30\u201332]. Accordingly, we investigated whether HIR modulates immune reaction in Dermatophagoides farina-treated NC/Nga mice. Our results show that HIR does suppress the development of AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. Furthermore, we found that the suppressive effects of HIR on these changes were paralleled by a decrease in total plasma IgE level, and that this might be due to the down-regulation of Th2 cytokines. It is also possible that the inhibition of mast cell infiltration and degranulation in skin by HIR reduces expressions of Th2 cytokines in serum and spleen.",
                "Recently, innate immunity has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD [33, 34]. Nitric Oxide plays a role in vasodilation, neurotransmission, blood coagulation, and immune regulation. Furthermore, iNOS is a major producer of NO when it is activated by various cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccaride (LPS). Therefore, one of the methods used to examine the anti-inflammatory activity of a compound is to measure its suppressive effects on the synthesis of iNOS [35]. COX-2 is markedly expressed in inflammation-related cells in response to stimulations by cytokines.",
                "In summary, we show here that HIR inhibits the development of AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice induced by the repeated application of mite. The topical application and intraperitoneal injection of HIR could improve AD-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice by inhibiting IgE, eosinophil count, or other Th2-related cytokines and inflammatory factors. Taken together, our finding suggested that the topical application and intraperitoneal injection of HIR may be a novel approach to the treatment of AD."
