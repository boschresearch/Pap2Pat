    "abstract": "Nonvolatile, molecular multiferroic devices have now been demonstrated, but it is worth giving some consideration to the issue of whether such devices could be a competitive alternative for solid-state nonvolatile memory. For the Fe (II) spin crossover complex [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)], where pz = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)-borohydride and bipy = 2,2\u2032-bipyridine, voltage-controlled isothermal changes in the electronic structure and spin state have been demonstrated and are accompanied by changes in conductance. Higher conductance is seen with [Fe{H2B(pz)2}2(bipy)] in the high spin state, while lower conductance occurs for the low spin state. Plausibly, there is the potential here for low-cost molecular solid-state memory because the essential molecular thin films are easily fabricated. However, successful device fabrication does not mean a device that has a practical value. Here, we discuss the progress and challenges yet facing the fabrication of molecular multiferroic devices, which could be considered competitive to silicon.",

                "As the expectations for novel organic electronics grow, the design of flexible and high-density nonvolatile memory device remains a hot topic. The successes with organic electronics, combined with indications of success in addressing the complex grand challenge of manipulating magnetically ordered states by electrical means, suggest new approaches and applications to develop novel spintronics. In molecular systems, the spin crossover (SCO) relates to the transition between a low spin (LS) of the metal ion (indeed, diamagnetic state in the case of the Fe 2+ system) to a high-spin (HS) paramagnetic state in 3D transition metal compounds, and for quite some time now, it has been suggested that the spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon has potential applicability in molecular spintronic devices [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]. In such device elements, based on the molecular spin state, is very likely that state switching may be accomplished without large current densities or power consumption. Molecular systems have the very real possibility of providing a room temperature device on a length scale less than 10 nm while delivering low-power nonvolatile local magneto-electric memory operations.",
                "We have investigated heteromolecular devices from molecular ferroelectrics and spin crossover molecular complex [Fe{H 2 B(pz) 2 } 2 (bipy)], where pz = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)borohydride and bipy = 2,2 -bipyridine [13,14]. Such devices work where the voltage control of the molecular spin states leads to nonvolatile conductance changes [13,14]. From these many perspectives of memory devices [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14] made possible by the molecular spinstate transition, we can construct a list of some of the key elements needed to make a competitive nonvolatile molecular device for memory applications.",

Nonetheless, a picture has emerged [5,7,8,12,22,23] of some of the key criteria needed to make a molecular spintronic device, based on spin crossover complexes, competitive with silicon technology.

                "Nonvolatile devices that are both two-terminal diode-like devices [13] and effectively four-terminal transistor devices [13,14] have been fabricated from spin crossover molecules. Both are seen to operate at room temperature. The diode or two-terminal multiferroic molecular devices are very much like the nonvolatile tunnel junction devices, in terms of implementation, for which there is considerable literature [24][25][26][27] and indeed a commercial product [28][29][30][31]. The two-terminal spin crossover heteromolecular nonvolatile device [13] could be very competitive, because the on/off ratio of the oxide tunnel barrier magnetic tunnel junction is typically very low, often less than 2 [32][33][34][35].",
                "Existing memory components are configured in numerous ways, the most common being SRAM (static random-access memory), DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), and NAND flash. They each have their own distinct advantages in memory cell area and read or write time. Spin-state molecular devices have inherent memory, so they do not benefit from being configured as an SRAM memory cell, where a positive feedback loop provides the memory storage rather than being provided by the device itself. In a similar way, memory, based on the nonvolatile manipulation of molecular spin state, is likely not suitable for configuration in a \"NAND Flash\" memory arrays, due to read difficulties and write difficulties associated with the very high resistance of these molecular devices, as noted below. However, the basic DRAM cell consists of an access transistor and a capacitive storage element. We can use the same concept of an access transistor but substitute the capacitor with a spin-state molecular device. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a plausible nonvolatile memory element cell. This memory cell is based on the field effect voltagecontrolled spin state molecular transistor described elsewhere [12][13][14] and could exploit the difference between the low-resistance and high-resistance states of a voltage-controlled spin-state molecular memory device fabricated from spin crossover complexes. However, unlike DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), where charge storage on the cell must be refreshed periodically, molecular spin-state memory is nonvolatile, as noted above and elsewhere [12][13][14], and the output is resistive. This is particularly useful when low-power memory is needed. The select transistor may be any appropriate transistor switch. It could be a silicon NMOS (n-channel MOSFET) device, a tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET), or even another molecular multiferroic spin transistor, providing that switching does not allow for any memory storage in the select transistor. voltage-controlled spin state molecular transistor described elsewhere [12][13][14] and could exploit the difference between the low-resistance and high-resistance states of a voltagecontrolled spin-state molecular memory device fabricated from spin crossover complexes.

With this DRAM-like configuration, read is achieved by activating the required bit line to a voltage high enough that the resistance of the multiferroic transistor may be read but low enough that programming cannot occur. Then, the word line is activated, so the resistance of a particular multiferroic transistor may be read. Read is achieved with a current sensing amplifier, as the read voltage is typically in the tens to hundreds of millivolts, and a current sense amplifier is more robust in these conditions. It is anticipated that the sense amplifier will be constructed in conventional MOS technology. In order to write a state into the spin transistor, the bit line is raised to the positive reprogramming voltage to program a \"1\" state or lowered to a sufficiently negative voltage that the transistor is programmed to the \"0\" state.",

The problem with making the thin film from solution is that solvent effects are known to alter the characteristics of the spin-state transition for some spin crossover complexes [79,80]. This is not likely to be an insurmountable problem, but realistically, the molecular solubility and solvent effects are issues that would have to be addressed if this were chosen as the route to large scale device fabrication. Presently, efforts to explore solubility and solvent effects are only in their infancy."

                "A competitive nonvolatile device requires locking of the spin state in the region of room temperature, as has been achieved with the inclusion of both dipolar molecular additives [73,81] as well as from the influence of the substrate. Key here is that the polarization of a ferroelectric interface can preferentially favor the adoption of the high or low spin state of an adjacent spin cross molecular thin film [13,14,72,77] over a wide range of temperatures from 100 K [72] to 350 K [14]. It is important to note that this influence of the ferroelectric substrate domain polarization extends away from the interface with ferroelectric and well into the adjacent spin crossover molecular thin film. The exact mechanisms for this influence of the substrate on the spin state of the molecular spin crossover complex thin film have not been precisely identified, but intermolecular cooperative effects are implicated in the influence of the substrate on the adjacent spin crossover molecular thin film [71]. The fact that the interface polarization influences the spin-state occupancy significantly for molecular spin crossover complex thin films up to 20 molecular layers [71], and for even greater film thicknesses in a somewhat diminished manner [14] means that device fabrication does not require precise and stringent film thickness choices, easing the constraints.",
                "Thus far, there is no evidence of finite scaling effects that would lead to diminished critical temperatures with thinner films, although intermolecular cooperativity is seen to vary with film thickness [71]. The result is that isothermal switching (as discussed below) is more complete, and spin-state locking is more effective in thinner films than thicker films. We note, in passing, that the surface of molecular spin crossover complex thin film may have a different spin-state occupancy than the rest of the film [71]. Furthermore, since the device has to be both top and bottom gated, the molecular spin crossover complex thin film will be influenced by two different interfaces, and the effects of the latter have not yet been investigated in detail."

This is the device \"write\" operation and has now been demonstrated [13,14]. Recent studies [74,82] suggest that an applied magnetic field could reduce the activation barrier to a change in spin state, but as with light activation of a spin state change [69,77], this does not seem to lend itself toward a readily applicable memory application. Just the same, isothermal spin state and conductance switching has been demonstrated. It is this achievement of nonvolatile voltage control of the molecular spin state [13,14] that opens the door to potential practical applications. The adjacent ferroelectric layer provides a low coercivity voltage control of the spin state, as well as nonvolatility, but the device practicalities favor the use of organic [13,14] rather than inorganic [77] ferroelectrics, as discussed next.",

                "Organic ferroelectric thin films are also far from perfect in their behavior. First, there is the problem that the faster the switching speed, the higher the coercive voltage needed [87]. Second, the coercive voltages for each ferroelectric polarization direction may differ as the film thickness decreases [79]. The loss of symmetry in the coercive voltage can be the result of the interface with a conducting contact [92]. Organic ferroelectric thin films also tend to exhibit preferential upward polarization [103]. Finally, there is the problem that the polarization hysteresis is not \"square\", meaning that the application of higher voltage, the coercive voltage, may be necessary to achieve full polarization.",
                "If the current density is 1 electron per molecule in 1 ns, this translates into an overall minimum current density of 3.6 \u00d7 10 5 A/cm 2 . This approaches the industry goal of a current density of 10 4 A/cm 2 . This is because the gate supply needs to be able to do two things: (1) be able to make the device switch the polarization of the ferroelectric gate dielectric, and hence the spin state in the spin crossover molecular layer (where the latter plays the role of the semiconductor channel in the transistor geometry) at a reasonable supply voltage. In other words, the gate supply voltage should not be too high and not too low. If the gate supply voltage required is too high, then the implementation of room temperature nonvolatile spin crossover transistor molecular devices would require highvoltage supplies or charge pumps on chip in order to program a memory device. This is why EEPROM is not a very popular nonvolatile memory device-it simply requires too much supply voltage to make it a very usable memory. If the gate supply voltages are too significant, this would limit the application of nonvolatile spin crossover transistor molecular devices to one-time-programmable memory only. On the other hand, if the programming voltage could be brought down to a very low value, it has the advantage of making the memory chip easy to program, but circuitry then has to be carefully designed to ensure that accidental programming does not occur especially during the read operations.",
                "(2) The second factor to be considered is speed of write. While less important than the ability to write a memory cell, speed is nonetheless important, and it becomes more important in memory applications requiring a fast write time. Unfortunately, the writing or programing voltage and the write speed requirements can act against each other in operational memory, since the lower the programming or write voltage, the better it is for the write time, but reducing the programming voltage too much increases the chances of a write \"disturb\" event.",
                "We do know that the molecular ferroelectric gate dielectrics can be made as thin as 1 nm and still be reliable [90,96], and the coercive voltage would be <0.5 V. A gate dielectric 2 nm thick would be \"worry free\" with a coercive voltage of about 0.8 V or less. A ferroelectric gate dielectric any thicker than that would result in an unnecessary increase in the coercive voltage and an increase in the current needed to \"write\" the gate ferroelectric correctly. The desire for faster write speeds means that the peak current densities needed to provide the correct ferroelectric polarization at the gate will also scale up. There has to be recognition that there is a trade-off between faster write speeds and lower peak current densities for a \"write\" operation."

So far, the read operation has been successfully exploiting the conductance change that accompanies the change in molecular spin state [12][13][14], as seen in Figure 4. In part, this conductance change may be associated with the known changes to the highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap that occur with a change in spin state. For [Fe{H 2 B(pz) 2 } 2 (bipy)], the highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gap is much larger (by about 2 eV [72]) in the low spin state than the high spin state. A smaller band gap for the high spin state of [Fe{H 2 B(pz) 2 } 2 (bipy)] is consistent with a higher conductance, and this higher conductance is seen in working room temperature devices [13,14].

A number of measurements suggest sub-picosecond switching speeds [55,117]. This means that the switching speed is limited by the switching speed of the ferroelectric. For copolymers of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), this means that the reversal of a ferroelectric domain will take far longer than a nanosecond, because of the need to rotate the -CH 2 CF 2 -chemical formulae units. Benzimidazole, 2-methylbenzimidazole [108], 5,6-dichloro-2-methylbenzimidazole [118], bridged bis(benzimidazole) [119], and croconic acid [91,98] are molecular ferroelectrics that require far less dramatic atomic repositioning and thus potentially should have faster ferroelectric polarization switching speeds.",

Resistance, as discussed above, can play a big role in determining the overall operational speed of the device. This latter point is complicated not just by the resistance of the spin crossover molecular layer, which acts to reduce the operation speed of the device but a variety of parasitic capacitances. The demonstration that the magnetic field reduces the activation barrier separating the high and low spin states [82] does suggest that faster switching speed may be possible with the application of a magnetic field, but this may be an unwanted complication in the implementation of nonvolatile multiferroic molecular devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes for memory.",

Read time is typically more important than write time, since typically, there are more read than write cycles, especially in nonvolatile memory configurations. A moderately high on/off ratio of more than 10 3 , as suggested by the current changes seen for more complete spin-state switching for data taken in in the transistor geometry [14], may be possible. This higher on/off ratio would allow for faster sense amplifiers and a variety of memory configurations.

In the case of spin crossover systems, spin-state switching at room temperature has been demonstrated to the 3.6 \u00b1 0.8 nm scale [123]. Again, this demonstration [123] provides considerable evidence that devices at the 10 nm scale are possible, and this would be competitive with silicon (CMOS) technologies. Yet the on-state resistance is high, as discussed above. Even a decrease of the on-state resistance to about 0.5 \u2126\u2022cm through a better choice of spin crossover complex would still mean a substantial device resistance on the nanometer scale. While the materials properties indicate that spin-state switching is possible below 10 nm, the exigencies of device implementation may preclude this implementation of nonvolatile voltage-controlled spin crossover molecular devices at dimensions below 10 nm as a result of the high on-state resistance as discussed above. Yet, depending on the lithography resolution, the source-drain distance could be decreased to lower the device resistance.",

Yet, there has been considerable progress in meeting the challenges that need to be satisfied. Of the dozen actual device issues listed in the introduction, seven of the challenges have been met and addressed in a working device.",
                "A competitive nonvolatile multiferroic molecular device, fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes, still needs to be demonstrated. The challenges that must be addressed but have not yet been realized in a working device, are clearly a smaller on-state resistance, faster switching speeds, low coercive voltages, and low peak power write current densities in reproducible working devices at the 10 to 50 nm scale that can endure 10 16 switches, as indicated in Table 1. A crude estimate of the write energy can be made, as even if the device is a perfect capacitor between the top and bottom gates with perfect gate dielectric layers, to reverse the electric field, current has to flow. If we assume perfect charge ionization, then the maximum current required to switch the ferroelectric polarization is determined by the required charge of one electron per dipole. Assuming one electron per molecule [96] and a molecular bilayer of ferroelectric, with a coercive voltage of 0.2, the write energy for a nonvolatile multiferroic transistor, fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes, would be in the region of 70 aJ, which is far less than the roughly 100 fJ write energy of STT RAM at 65 nm [32,124] and comparable to the 15 pJ write energy expected of ferroelectric RAM at 45 to 65 nm [125]. This estimate for nonvolatile multiferroic devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes neglects the device contact resistance, which is likely to be significant because of the molecular band offsets [120-122], as noted above. Given the exigencies associated with device implementation, a more realistic write energy for the nonvolatile multiferroic molecular device would be in the region of 0.7 fJ (about 10 times the estimated floor) or higher.",
                "The question is whether nonvolatile multiferroic devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes with transistor widths of 30, 40, or 50 nm are competitive. With an on-state resistance estimated to be about 67 K\u2126 per device at a transistor width of 50 nm and a spin crossover complex on state resistance of 0.5 \u2126cm, these devices begin to appear to have practical value. There are certainly circumstances where devices with a resistance of 100 K\u2126 can be used for memory [126]. With the DRAM-type device arrangement, the gate is connected to the drain, so it may be that the best resistance goal would be something around 200 K\u2126. The prospect of getting close to this goal seems to be increasingly realistic.",
                "The speed of the memory read is the major factor of concern when we consider device resistance. There is no hard limit to resistance maximum, but for every doubling of memory resistance, to a first-order approximation, the read time doubles. For some types of memory, for example NAND flash, a very slow read time is acceptable, but this is in order to achieve a very compact memory cell. In the case of magneto-electric memory cells, the base cell size is bigger than the flash cell, and so this arena of very compact memory is not an area where nonvolatile multiferroic molecular devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes is likely to be competitive. Instead, the target for nonvolatile multiferroic molecular devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes is faster cache memories. With these possible implementations, it is acceptable to increase the width of the memory cell, within limits, and a cell width up to about 80 nm (with gate length of 12 nm) may be acceptable. A major advantage of the nonvolatile multiferroic devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes is that there is the possibility of 3D integration of this technology, which can drastically increase the memory capacity. The fact that the multiferroic molecular device fabrication temperatures are low allows many layers of such devices to be fabricated on a silicon chip without damaging the underlying silicon transistor devices. This becomes particularly interesting in the case of crossbar arrays of nonvolatile multiferroic molecular devices, as in that implementation, one does not need one silicon transistor per each cell.",
                "The nonvolatile multiferroic devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes also appear to be competitive with zinc-tin oxide thin-film transistors [127] and other amorphous oxide semiconductor transistor schemes that might be used in flexible electronics such as displays [128]. After all, the nonvolatile multiferroic devices fabricated from spin crossover molecular complexes are molecular thin film devices and thus flexible. DE-NA0003525.
