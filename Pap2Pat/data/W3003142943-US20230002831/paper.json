    "abstract": "Liquid biopsies are providing new opportunities for detection of residual disease in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) after surgery but may be confounded through identification of alterations arising from clonal hematopoiesis. Here, we identify circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) alterations through ultrasensitive targeted sequencing analyses of matched cfDNA and white blood cells from the same patient. We apply this approach to analyze samples from patients in the CRITICS trial, a phase III randomized controlled study of perioperative treatment in patients with operable gastric cancer. After filtering alterations from matched white blood cells, the presence of ctDNA predicts recurrence when analyzed within nine weeks after preoperative treatment and after surgery in patients eligible for multimodal treatment. These analyses provide a facile method for distinguishing ctDNA from other cfDNA alterations and highlight the utility of ctDNA as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative cancer therapy and surgical resection in patients with gastric cancer.",

                "A major challenge after multimodal curative treatment for resectable gastric cancer is identifying patients with microscopic residual disease at high risk of recurrence after surgery1\u20134. Currently available imaging techniques and traditional blood biomarkers to capture minimal residual disease (MRD) state after surgery have poor sensitivity and do not play a role in clinical practice5. Histopathological assessment of the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on resection specimens has become an important tool to provide prognostic information6\u20138. However, microscopic residual tumor, lymph node infiltration, and poor histopathological response do not measure the real-time presence of residual disease. More recent approaches such as detection of circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) through liquid biopsies may provide new opportunities for identifying patients that would benefit from adjuvant treatment options and further follow-up9\u201312.",
                "Theoretically, the ability to non-invasively detect tumor-specific alterations in the circulation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery has the potential to rapidly and dynamically inform the presence of MRD or preclinical metastases13,14. Cell-free ctDNA is released from tumor cells into the circulation and has been detected in patients with early- and late-stage cancers15\u201319. A key challenge of liquid biopsy approaches has been developing methods to detect and characterize small amounts of ctDNA in large populations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). A variety of studies have focused on changes in ctDNA during the course of therapy, but mostly in the setting of metastatic disease and largely centered on the analysis of a limited number of genomic positions that may only represent a subset of clones of the tumor20\u201328. More recent studies have used panels of commonly mutated driver genes to allow detection of multiple driver clones, typically at the time of diagnosis, after surgery, or at disease progression16,18,27,29\u201334. However, blood-based deep sequencing approaches have raised concerns about detection and misclassification of white blood cell (WBC)-derived variants in cfDNA associated with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential18,35\u201337. Such\u00a0studies have typically assessed WBC DNA and cfDNA in patients with cancer at a single timepoint18,38\u201340 or in healthy individuals41,\u00a0and\u00a0did not attempt to evaluate these during the course of therapy to predict clinical outcome.",
                "In the present study, we apply a matched cfDNA and WBC sequencing approach to accurately detect ctDNA alterations after preoperative chemotherapy and after surgery in patients with resectable gastric cancer. We hypothesize that ctDNA detection after completion of preoperative treatment as well as MRD detection after surgery can predict recurrence and survival in patients with resectable gastric cancer treated with multimodal therapeutic regimens. Overall, these analyses evaluate a strategy to distinguish ctDNA alterations from cfDNA variants related to clonal hematopoiesis and investigate whether ctDNA elimination before or after surgery can serve as a predictive biomarker of patient outcome to perioperative treatment."

                        "The current study was an exploratory analysis of the predictive value of ctDNA assessment in a subset of patients from the CRITICS (ChemoRadiotherapy after Induction chemoTherapy In Cancer of the Stomach) study (NCT00407186), an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, phase III randomized controlled trial of perioperative chemotherapy (chemotherapy group) vs. preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy group) for patients with resectable gastric cancer42. Between 11 January 2007 and 17 April 2015, a total of 788 patients from 56 hospitals in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark were randomized upfront to receive three preoperative 21-day cycles of intravenous epirubicin, cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and oral capecitabine followed by three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin, cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and oral capecitabine (chemotherapy group) or to receive the same preoperative regimen followed by radiation combined with daily capecitabine and weekly cisplatin (chemoradiotherapy group).",
                        "As a proof-of-principle study, we sequenced and analyzed matched cfDNA and WBC samples from 50 treatment-naive patients from the Netherlands who fulfilled the following criteria: (i) were enrolled in one of the two arms of the study and received three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy; (ii) had plasma available from at least two consecutive timepoints processed within 24\u2009h after blood collection for cfDNA analyses; (iii) had buffy coat or whole blood at baseline for WBC analysis; and (iv) had clinical follow-up longer than 18 months if they were free of disease after therapy (Fig.\u00a01a; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01; Supplementary Data\u00a01). Our goal was to predict survival outcomes based on ctDNA assessment after preoperative therapy and MRD analyses after surgery with curative intent. Of the patients analyzed, 25 had diffuse subtype, 24 had intestinal subtype according to Lauren\u2019s classification, and one was diagnosed with adenosquamous gastric carcinoma (Fig.\u00a01b; Supplementary Data\u00a01). Twenty-one patients were surgically treated with distal gastrectomy, 17 with total gastrectomy, four with esophagocardiac resection, and one with proximal gastrectomy. Despite initial eligibility at the time of treatment enrollment, six patients showed evidence of advanced disease during the exploratory laparotomy and were not submitted to surgical resection. One additional patient did not undergo surgical treatment for unknown reasons. Histopathological regression after preoperative therapy was determined according to Mandard\u2019s tumor regression grade (TRG). Three patients achieved complete regression after three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy at the time of surgery (TRG 1), while 10, 15, 13, and 2 patients presented with pathological stage I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Centrally reviewed pathological assessment of resection specimens after three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy showed that 20 patients did not have evidence of lymph node involvement (ypN0), while 23 patients had lymph node infiltration, including 10 patients with ypN1 (including 3 ypN1mi), 7 patients with ypN2, and 6 patients with ypN3 disease. Twenty-six patients received postoperative treatment with radiation combined with cisplatin and capecitabine, and 24 patients were postoperatively treated with three cycles of epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine without radiation after surgery.Fig. 1Analysis of cfDNA in patients with resectable gastric cancer.Study schematic\u00a0(a). Patients with confirmed stage IB\u2013IVA gastric adenocarcinoma eligible for perioperative treatment with systemic chemotherapy were randomized upfront to receive three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, followed by three cycles of postoperative chemotherapy, or to receive the same preoperative regimen, followed by postoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. A blood draw was collected for each patient at the time of study enrollment (baseline), after three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (preoperative timepoint), and after surgery (postoperative timepoint). Blood samples were initially processed to allow extraction of cfDNA from plasma and genomic DNA (gDNA) from white blood cells (WBC). Both cfDNA and WBC gDNA libraries were captured with custom RNA oligo pools encompassing 80,930 bases across 58 cancer driver genes. Capture libraries were sequenced at high coverage (>30,000\u00d7), followed by sequence alignment, error correction, and variant calling. Mutations detected in WBCs were identified in cfDNA and removed, allowing the identification of tumor-specific mutations in cfDNA. Clinicopathological characteristics, type of surgical treatment, pathological stage, and type of postoperative treatment for the subset of patients were analyzed in this translational study (n\u2009=\u200950) (b).

                        "For each patient, plasma and buffy coat were collected at the time of trial enrollment (baseline timepoint), after patients received three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (preoperative timepoint), and after surgery but before the initiation of the adjuvant treatment (postoperative timepoint) (Fig.\u00a01a; Supplementary Data\u00a01 and 2). We developed an approach to identify tumor-specific alterations in the circulation independent of tissue analyses by parallel deep sequencing of cfDNA and WBCs, followed by identification of cfDNA alterations and removal of hematopoietic-related changes detected in WBCs. For sequencing analyses of cfDNA and WBCs, we used a next-generation targeted error correction\u00a0sequencing approach to evaluate 58 cancer driver genes (Fig.\u00a01a; Supplementary Data\u00a03\u20135)18. This method is based on targeted capture and deep sequencing (>30,000\u00d7) of DNA fragments to identify single base substitutions and small insertions or deletions in cfDNA across 80,930\u2009bp of coding gene regions while distinguishing these from PCR amplification and sequencing artifacts18. For alterations detected in cfDNA that were not identified by matched WBC sequencing, we determined the probability that such an alteration was tumor derived from a Bayesian statistical model using the frequency of altered alleles and total coverage of cfDNA and WBC sequences (see Methods).",
                        "To estimate the theoretical sensitivity of detection of the sequencing approach in gastric cancer, we determined the proportion of gastric adenocarcinomas in the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas43 with alterations in one or more of the 58 analyzed genes. These analyses showed that our targeted panel would have a sensitivity of ~88% as 384 of 436 gastric cancer cases had at least one alteration in these genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Overall, we observed that median levels of mutant allele fractions at baseline were significantly higher in patients with intestinal subtype when compared to diffuse subtype (0.295 vs. 0%, p\u2009=\u20090.015, Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum test) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a). There was no statistically significant difference among levels of mutant allele fractions among well, moderately, or poorly differentiated tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.07, Kruskal\u2013Wallis test) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). In our study, patients with intestinal and diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma experienced similar event-free (Supplementary Data\u00a01; Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c) and overall survival (Supplementary Data\u00a01; Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d). Consistent with the findings of the original trial42, we did not observe significant differences in survival outcomes related to the postoperative treatment arm in which patients had been randomized (Supplementary Data\u00a01; Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e, f)."

                        "We evaluated cfDNA in all 50 patients at baseline and after three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. At baseline, we detected sequence alterations in cfDNA from 40 patients (80%) (Fig.\u00a02a; Supplementary Data\u00a06) and in WBCs from 31 patients (62%) (Fig.\u00a02b; Supplementary Data\u00a07). After removing WBC-derived alterations from cfDNA data (Supplementary Data\u00a08), we detected 54 alterations that were likely tumor-specific in 27 patients (54%) (Fig.\u00a02c; Supplementary Data\u00a09). The most frequently altered genes detected in ctDNA were TP53 (22%), MYC (15%), PIK3CA (15%), KRAS (11%), HRAS (11%), BRAF (11%), ALK (11%), ATM (11%), KIT (11%), and CDH1 (7%) (Fig.\u00a02c; Supplementary Data\u00a09). In accord with the molecular classification of gastric adenocarcinomas proposed by the TCGA44, we found a higher frequency (60%) of PIK3CA mutations in ctDNA of patients with Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)-positive (n\u2009=\u20093) or MSI-high tumors (n\u2009=\u20092) compared to the frequency (3%) in EBV-negative (n\u2009=\u200936) and MSS tumors (n\u2009=\u200937).Fig. 2Identification of white blood cell and ctDNA variants in cfDNA.Ultrasensitive targeted sequencing was used to detect mutations in cfDNA (a) and WBCs (b) in 50 patients, with only those cases having alterations indicated. Tumor-specific mutations in ctDNA were identified in 27 individuals after subtraction of WBC-derived variants in cfDNA (c). Density plots showing the mutant allele fraction distribution of cfDNA variants (top, yellow), WBC variants (middle, purple), and resulting ctDNA variants (bottom, blue) (d). Levels of mutant allele fractions in WBCs (horizontal axis) and their correspondent levels in cfDNA (vertical axis) suggest that WBC alterations are identified at similar levels in cfDNA (Pearson\u2018s correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.91, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The probability that an identified variant is tumor-derived when the alteration is not detected in WBCs is indicated by the shading of the blue dots (e). Association between age (horizontal axis) and absolute number of WBC variants detected in each patient (vertical axis) suggests that the number of WBC alterations increase with age (r2\u2009=\u20090.36, exponential correlation) (f). Positions and frequencies of mutations in TP53 detected in cfDNA (top plot) and WBCs (bottom plot) demonstrate that the majority of TP53 alterations in cfDNA are from WBCs. One TP53 splice site mutation detected in both datasets is not shown (g). Cumulative fraction of cfDNA fragments based on cfDNA fragment length (bp) shows an altered distribution for cfDNA fragments harboring tumor-derived TP53 alterations (blue) compared to WBC TP53 variants (red) and wild-type TP53 sequences (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test) (h).",
                        "Genes most frequently affected in WBCs were DNMT3A (45%), TP53 (29%), EGFR (10%), APC (6%), AR (6%), ATM (6%), and MLH1 (6%) (Fig.\u00a02b; Supplementary Data\u00a07). Functional prediction analyses of these alterations using multiple approaches revealed that the majority of changes were likely to be deleterious or pathogenic45,46 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Data\u00a010). The median mutant allele fraction among 43 WBC-derived variants was 0.31% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.18\u20130.63%), which was similar to the median mutant allele fraction among 53 tumor-specific variants identified in cfDNA (0.31%, IQR 0.20\u20130.55%, p\u2009=\u20090.96, Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum test) (Fig.\u00a02d). We observed a high correlation between levels of mutant allele fractions in WBCs and levels of corresponding alterations in cfDNA (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient\u2009=\u20090.91) (Fig.\u00a02e). As expected, the number of alterations detected in WBCs increased with age (r2\u2009=\u20090.36, exponential correlation) (Fig.\u00a02f). Interestingly, we detected WBC variants in DNMT3A, TP53, ERBB4, MLH1, PDGFRA, FGFR3, ESR1, IDH2, and ATM among multiple timepoints analyzed in 11 patients that did not harbor any tumor-specific alterations in cfDNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b\u2013l).",

Of the cfDNA sequence changes observed in TP53, we identified 15 in WBC sequences as well as three alterations in WBC\u2019s that were not present in matched cfDNA (Fig.\u00a02g; Supplementary Data\u00a07). From the 21 TP53 alterations initially detected in cfDNA at baseline, only six were identified as tumor-specific mutations, including two with stop alterations (Q192* and S166*) as well as four missense mutations (R175H, V216M, N239S, R248W). We further evaluated fragment length distributions of the 21 TP53 alterations detected in cfDNA. We observed that fragments harboring tumor-specific TP53 mutations in the circulation were significantly shorter than fragments harboring TP53 variants associated with clonal hematopoiesis (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test), as well as fragments harboring wild-type TP53 coding regions (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test) (Fig.\u00a02h; Supplementary Data\u00a07\u20139). Comparison of all ctDNA and WBC variants in this study to the COSMIC database of somatic alterations revealed an enrichment of solid tumors having alterations at the same positions as ctDNA variants, while hematological malignancies were enriched with alterations at positions of WBC changes (p\u2009<\u20090.0001, \u03c72 test) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). Overall, detection of WBC variants and tumor-derived ctDNA variants at baseline did not reveal statistically significant differences in event-free or overall survival (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b\u2013e)."

Of the 30 patients with measurable ctDNA at baseline or at the preoperative timepoint after filtering WBC sequence alterations (Fig.\u00a02c), 11 experienced a complete elimination of ctDNA levels after 9 weeks of systemic treatment (Supplementary Figs.\u00a06 and 7; Supplementary Data\u00a05). As an example, patient CGST33, who presented with intestinal subtype gastric adenocarcinoma at diagnosis, had mutant allele fraction concentrations of 2.32% and 0.64% for TP53 Q192* and ERBB2 R756Cfs*2, respectively, that were completely eliminated at the preoperative timepoint. This drop in ctDNA occurred in conjunction with a major pathological response (TRG 2) in the specimen obtained at the time of surgery (Fig.\u00a03a). In contrast, 19 patients had detectable ctDNA at the preoperative timepoint (Supplementary Figs.\u00a06 and 7; Supplementary Data\u00a05), including as an example in patient CGST110 who had mutant allele fractions of 0.15% for ERBB4 T639M at baseline and 0.12% at the preoperative timepoint (Fig.\u00a03b). This patient did not experience tumor regression after 9 weeks of systemic treatment (TRG 5) and eventually died from recurrent disease 35 months after the initial diagnosis (Supplementary Data\u00a01). Three of the 19 patients identified had ctDNA levels below the limit of detection at baseline, but presented with detectable ctDNA at the preoperative timepoint, suggesting that they did not respond to the preoperative treatment (Supplementary Data\u00a08).

In contrast, we detected postoperative tumor-specific mutations in 9 out of 16 patients with minor or no pathologic tumor responses (TRG 3\u20135), including in patient CGST68, who presented with mutant allele fraction of 0.03% for HRAS D54Efs*53 frameshift mutation at the baseline timepoint. This patient exhibited progressive increases in mutant allele fractions of HRAS at preoperative and postoperative timepoints, followed by the emergence of ERBB4 D1184*, detected at 0.16% mutant allele fraction after surgery (Fig.\u00a04b; Supplementary Data\u00a01 and 8).Fig. 4Assessment of ctDNA as a minimal residual disease biomarker in resectable gastric cancer.Levels of ctDNA variants at baseline, preoperative, and postoperative timepoints\u00a0in a molecular responder (CGST32) (a) and in a non-responder (CGST68) (b).

On the other hand, six out of nine patients with detectable tumor-specific mutations at the postoperative timepoint developed disease recurrence and died from metastatic disease (Fig.\u00a04c; Supplementary Data\u00a01). Detection of mutations in cfDNA without a WBC filter after surgery did not predict recurrence (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a) or death (Fig.\u00a04d). In contrast, with the WBC-guided hematopoietic filter, we observed a significant shorter median event-free survival and a 21.8 times higher risk of disease recurrence for patients with detectable tumor-specific mutations after surgery (18.7 months vs. median not reached; log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.001; HR\u2009=\u200921.8; 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.9\u2013123.1) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010b) as well as a significantly shorter median overall survival (28.7 vs. median not reached; log-rank p\u2009<\u20090.001; HR\u2009=\u200921.8; 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.9\u2013123.1) (Fig.\u00a04e).

                "High mortality rates associated with gastric cancer reflect the prevalence of advanced disease at presentation, when treatment options are limited4. Despite the value of multimodal curative treatment approaches, a significant fraction of patients will eventually perish as a consequence of locoregional relapse, peritoneal recurrence, or distant metastases2,3. Current methods to estimate the risk of disease recurrence after surgery mostly rely on the assessment of pathological staging and microscopic residual disease score systems6\u20138. However, there are several limitations with these approaches, especially with tumor regression grading scales, which make their implementation difficult in daily clinical practice8. Furthermore, the poor sensitivity of currently available imaging methods and blood protein biomarkers to detect remaining disease after curative surgery has provided an opportunity for ctDNA analyses for MRD assessment in gastric cancer. There is an urgent clinical need to select patients who need adjuvant treatment because of the presence of MRD. Here, we have developed a tissue-independent sequencing approach using ultrasensitive sequencing of matched cfDNA and WBCs to detect tumor-specific mutations in cfDNA after completion of preoperative chemotherapy as well as after surgery in patients with resectable gastric cancer.",
                "In this study, we investigated the value of parallel deep sequencing of cfDNA and WBCs to detect cfDNA alterations associated with clonal hematopoiesis and used this approach to longitudinally infer bona fide tumor-specific alterations independent of matched tumor analyses. Although ctDNA analyses for detection of MRD have been utilized for a variety of solid tumors13,14,23,27,32,33,47,48, these efforts have used a tumor-guided approach to identify potential alterations. An advantage of our approach is the identification of ctDNA without requiring tumor tissue, which may be unobtainable or available to a limited extent and where sequencing analyses may be hampered by intra-tumoral heterogeneity.",
                "As the majority of cfDNA typically arises from hematopoietic cells49, a major challenge for the development of MRD assays using noninvasive liquid biopsies is distinguishing tumor-specific mutations from background changes associated with biological variation. WBC-derived alterations that arise as a consequence of clonal hematopoiesis may confound liquid biopsy analyses that are based on characterization of cfDNA as these may occur in common cancer driver genes38\u201341. As we have shown here, cfDNA analyses without parallel analyses of WBC DNA would have been unable to appropriately identify patients that benefit from perioperative treatment in terms of event-free and overall survival.",
                "However, there are some limitations when using these approaches to noninvasively\u00a0detect gastric cancer, especially in patients with localized disease. In this study, although we analyzed a relatively small number of patients with available plasma samples, the extensive follow-up time of the CRITICS trial allowed for accurate determination of clinical recurrences. Despite the fact that the panel we utilized was not developed for gastric cancer we detected the majority of patients at the baseline timepoint. Of the patients not detected at baseline, 61% had diffuse subtype, highlighting potential differences in DNA shedding associated with this histological feature. Some patients did not recur despite positive ctDNA results after surgery, but this observation is consistent with the fact that a fraction of patients receiving adjuvant therapy would be expected to be cured of disease50,51 and we did not assess ctDNA levels after adjuvant therapy. Future studies will address the value of post-adjuvant ctDNA status as a surrogate marker for adjuvant treatment efficacy. Tumor-guided personalized approaches may improve the accuracy of such methods14,32, but have the disadvantage of requiring tumor tissue and are challenging to implement as widely available standardized tests. Although our approach can be improved in the future with targeted panels specifically designed for gastric cancer and incorporating fragmentation analyses of cfDNA19, our efforts provide a proof of principle of the utility of ctDNA analyses in patients receiving perioperative treatment and deserves further validation in randomized interventional trials."

The CRITICS study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center, phase III randomized controlled trial of perioperative chemotherapy (chemotherapy group) vs. preoperative chemotherapy with postoperative chemoradiotherapy (chemoradiotherapy group) in patients with resectable gastric cancer42. A total of 788 patients from 56 hospitals in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark were randomized upfront to receive three preoperative 21-day cycles of intravenous epirubicin, cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and oral capecitabine followed by three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin, cisplatin or oxaliplatin, and oral capecitabine (chemotherapy group) or to receive the same preoperative regimen followed by postoperative radiotherapy combined with daily capecitabine and weekly cisplatin (chemoradiotherapy group) (Fig.\u00a01a; Supplementary Fig.\u00a01; Supplementary Data\u00a01). Baseline blood samples at the time of trial enrollment were used for both cfDNA and WBC targeted deep sequencing (30,000\u00d7), followed by independent variant calling and further tumor-specific mutation detection using the WBC-filtering approach (Fig.\u00a01a).

This prior is equivalent to a sample with 2.4 altered reads per 340 distinct molecules. Sampling a large number of \u03b8s from the prior, we computed the probability of the observed data for each simulated \u03b8. The ergodic average of these probabilities approximates the likelihood of the observed data conditional on the model, but unconditional on \u03b8.
