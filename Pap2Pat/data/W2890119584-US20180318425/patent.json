                        "More than 5 million Americans suffer from fractures annually. Delayed fracture healing often occurs in the elderly, leading to decreased quality of life and increased health care cost. The development of new therapeutic approaches to promote fracture repair is a critical clinical need. Mesenchymal stem/Progenitor Cells (MPCs) have been tested in animal models and human of fracture with promising results (Mukherjee et al., 2008, J. Clin. Invest. 118:491-514). Three cellular processes which actively participate in fracture healing are MPC homing to the fracture site; expanding, and differentiating into osteogenic cells (Undale et al., 2011, J. Orthop. Res. 29:1804-1811; Satija et al., 2007, Stem Cells Dev. 16:7-23). A factor that regulates all three of these processes would be an ideal drug candidate or target. It was found that MPCs from mice deficient in several members of the Nedd4 sub-class of E3 ligases, have increased migration, growth and OB differentiation by increasing the stability of Runx2, JunB and CXCR4 proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Xing et al., 2010, J. Cell Biochem. 110:554-563). MPCs from aged mice have increased UPS-mediated Runx2 and JunB degradation (Shu et al., 2013, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research 28 1925-1935).",
                        "The UPS is an important complex cellular machine for protein posttranslational modifications, which specifically adds or removes ubiquitin to the substrate, resulting in the degradation of ubiquitinated (Ub) substrate in proteasomes or lysosomes. The substrate ubiquitination is carried out via sequential enzymatic reactions involving ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and ubiquitin ligase E3 that confer substrate specificity by linking ubiquitin to target molecules. A number of osteoblast (OB) positive regulators such as BMP (Sapkota et al., 2007, Mol. Cell 25:441-454) and TGF\u03b2 signaling proteins (Chen et al., 2007, Int. J. Cncer 121:80-87), Runx2 (Xing et al., 2010, J. Cell Biochem. 110:554-563), JunB (Jones et al., 2012, Stem Cells Transl. Med. 1:70-78), and CXCR4 (Gil et al., 1999, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 7:901-919; Hirabayashi and Fujisaki, 2003, Clin. Pharmacokinet. 42:1319-1330) are regulated via the UPS by the Nedd4 sub-class of E3 ligases, which is composed of 7 members, including Nedd4-1, Nedd4-2, Itch, WWP1&2, and Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor (Smurf) 1&2.",
                        "The role of E3 ligase Smurf1, Wwp1 and Itch has been investigated in bone using Smurf1\u2212/\u2212, Wwp1\u2212/\u2212, and Itch\u2212/\u2212 mice. All of them have increased bone volumes, bone formation, and OB differentiation as a result of ubiquitination and degradation of JunB and Runx2 (Weathington and Mallampalli, 2014, J. Clin. Invest. 124:6-12; Morioka et al., 2010, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 18:1143-1148; Tanaka et al., 2010, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20:1355-1359; Arns et al., 2012, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20:2131-2140; Zhang et al., 2014, J. Clin. Invest.; Barten et al., 2006, Drugs R D 7:87-97; Zhou et al., 2010, Arthritis Rheum. 62:1881-1889). It has been discovered that bone fracture repair is composed of a series of events that involve inflammation, angiogenesis and osteogenesis, which are regulated by multiple mechanisms. However, the role of protein turnover by the UPS in fracture healing has not been explored.",
                        "In addition, a main challenge clinically is that an elderly individual often suffers from a non-union fracture, partially due to age-related decline of MPC-OB differentiation (Liebergall et al., 2013, Mol. Ther. J. Am. Soc. Gene Ther. 21:1631-1638). It has previously been reported that MPCs from aged mice have increased UPS-mediated proteasome degradation of Runx2 and JunB proteins (Shu et al., J. Bone Min. Res. 28:1925-1935).",
                        "Bortezimib (Btz, marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, originally named PS-341) is an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for patients with multiple myeloma. It acts by inhibiting the proteasome via reversible occupation of the active proteolytic site of the 20S proteasome (Jones et al., 2012, Stem Cells Transl. Med. 1:70-78). Its main cytotoxic effect on myeloma cells is through the induction of apoptosis after the accumulation of excessive protein (Hideshima et al., 2011, Mol. Cancer Ther. 10:2034-2042). It increases OB differentiation from mouse and human MPCs in vitro (Mukherjee et al., 2008, J. Clin. Invest. 118:491-504; Kaiser et al., 2013, Eur. J. Haematol. 90:263-272), promotes MPC-OB differentiation by inhibiting the turnover of OB positive regulators, and also inhibits osteoclast (OC) formation by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB/TRAF6 signal pathway (Hongming and Jian, 2009, Leukemia Res. 33:115-122; Khedgikar et al., 2013, Cell Death Dis. 4:e778). Due to its positive effect on OBs and negative effect on OCs, Btz and other proteasome inhibitors have been considered as very attractive candidates for the development of bone anabolic agents. Several mouse studies reported that Btz increases bone volume in normal and OVX mice (Chen et al., 2007, Int. J. Cancer 121:80-87), and promotes fracture healing, all of which were performed in young or adult mice (Khedgikar et al., 2013, Cell Death Dis. 4:e778; Maseda et al., 2008, Cell Death Differ. 15:600-612). However, the utilization of Btz in the clinic is limited by its toxicities, such as peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia (Weathington and Mallampalli, 2014, J. Clin. Invest. 124:6-12). There is an urgent need for new approaches to selectively target the delivery of Btz specifically to bone tissue to ameliorate and/or prevent the toxic side effects arising from systemic distribution and to make dose escalation possible in order to improve therapeutic outcomes.",
                        "Clinical information from myeloma therapy indicates that Btz and other proteasome inhibitors including Carfilzomib (marketed as Kyprolis by Onyx Pharmaceuticals) have significant toxicities, such as peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia, which restrict their utilization. In mice, Btz significantly reduces the number of T cells in the thymus as early as 3 days after administration (Maseda et al., 2008, Cell Death Differ. 15:600-612). These adverse effects are considered due to the systemic distribution of the drug. The synthesis of a bone-targeted (BT) Btz by linking Btz to active bisphosphonates (BPs) has recently been attempted (Agyin et al., 2013, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 23:6455-6458). Despite the finding that these Btz-BP conjugates inhibit myeloma cell growth in vitro, their effect in vivo was not reported to be useful. Furthermore, these Btz-BP conjugates linked Btz to a BP using a chemically and biochemically stable linkage such that cleavage in vivo is unlikely, and even if a cleavage did occur, Btz would not be the released substrate. Further, a bioactive (antiresorptive) BP (alendronate) was also utilized in this conjugate preparation, which makes it difficult to determine the source of activity (Agyin et al., 2013, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 23:6455-6458).",
                        "Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent BP derivatives have been developed and used in cells and in living mice, in which the NIR fluorophore IRDye78 was conjugated to the BP pamidronate that contains a single primary amine for conjugation (Shi et al., 2014, Arthritis Rheumatol. 66:657-666; Shu et al., 2013, J. Bone Miner. Res. 28:1925-1935). NIR imaging has also been used to study lymphatic draining function in mice (Zhao et al., 2010, J. Bone Miner. Res. 25:1246-1256; Zhao et al., 2011, Stem Cells 29:1601-1610).",
                        "There is a need in the art for new compounds and methods that selectively target the delivery of compounds such as Btz specifically to bone tissue in order to ameliorate and/or prevent the toxic side effects arising from systemic distribution and to make dose escalation possible in order to improve therapeutic outcomes. The present invention fulfills this need."

                        "This invention includes the unexpected identification of novel Bortezomib (Btz) conjugates that are useful for bone formation. In another aspect, the present invention includes the unexpected identification of novel Btz conjugates useful for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These bone-targeted compounds include a new chemical linker technology designed to conjugate Btz to a relatively biochemically inactive or active bisphosphonate (BP). As demonstrated herein, the compounds of the present invention have been shown to be effective in both reducing and preventing osteoclast formation and increasing osteoblast formation. The compounds of the invention have also been found to be effective directly as antitumor agents. The compounds of the invention have higher efficacy on bone fracture repair and as anti-myeloma cell agents and reduced systemic adverse effects, such as toxicity, than that of Btz (non-bone-targeted). The compounds of the invention are useful in treating patients with multiple myeloma, as well as patients with other bone disorders such as fracture, osteoporosis, cancer-bone metastasis, radiotherapy-induced osteoporosis, and arthritis. Thus, the present invention also includes compositions and methods useful for the treatment of bone disorders.",
                        "In part, the present invention provides a new chemical approach to link certain drugs to a bisphosphonate residue for a bone-targeting purpose, in which the drug is released from the conjugates on bone, allowing for a greater delivery of the drug to the bone compartment and a greater systemic safety of the conjugate than dosing the free drug component of the conjugate. Safety of the bisphosphonate component will generally be enhanced due to its inert bioactivity or short term use and low dose. The present invention also provides in part a new molecular pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, to promote bone fracture healing in a large patient population, including the elderly which to date has not been studied.",
                        "The chemical attachment points and other chemical variants unique to the compounds of the invention may be modified in order to adjust the payload release rate, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the compound comprises a non-cleavable linker and the compound has a bioactivity at least the same as the inherent pharmacological activity of the parent Btz. As demonstrated herein, Btz was found to accelerate callus formation and increase bone strength in young and aged fractured mice, which is associated with increased Nestin+MPCs, Ub-proteins, and blood vessel formation.",

                                "The present invention is partly based on the discovery that the use of carbamate linkers resulted in the delivery of Btz to bone by utilizing the boronic ester functional group of Btz as a linking group. One advantage of the present invention is that the linker is labile in the presence of the low pH conditions that occur on the bone surface.",
                                "Compounds Useful within the Invention",
                                "In one aspect, the present invention includes a compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated to a phosphonate moiety via a linker, wherein the therapeutic agent is bortezomib (Btz) or an analogue thereof. As used herein, the term \u201cconjugate\u201d refers to a compound comprising a therapeutic agent conjugated or attached to a phosphonate moiety via a linker.",
                                "Any suitable linker may be used in the invention, as would be understood by one ordinary skill in the art. The linkers may comprise any of a variety of functional groups including an amide, ester, ether, thioether, carbamate, urea, amine or other linkage. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a cleavable bond, e.g. a bond that is unstable and/or is cleaved upon changes in certain intracellular parameters (e.g., pH or redox potential). In one embodiment, the linker is cleaved due to acidic hydrolysis. In another embodiment, the linker is cleaved enzymatically, such as by a protease. In another embodiment, the linker is cleaved due to both acidic hydrolysis and enzymatically. In some embodiments, the linker is non-cleavable. For example, it may be desirable to prevent or reduce the rate of release of Btz from the conjugate when the conjugate itself possesses desirable bioactivity. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the stability of the bond between the linker and the bisphosphonate group and between the linker and the Btz molecule influences how slowly or rapidly each respective bond is cleaved in a particular environment, thereby influencing how slowly or rapidly Btz may be released from the conjugate. In one embodiment, Btz is released slowly from the conjugate. In another embodiment, Btz is released rapidly from the conjugate. In a non-limiting example, the linker is bonded to the Btz molecule and/or the bisphosphonate via a functional group on the linker that provides a more stable bond, and therefore reduces the rate at which Btz is released from the conjugate. In another non-limiting example, the linker may be bonded to the Btz molecule and/or the bisphosphonate via a functional group on the linker that provides a more labile or less stable bond, and therefore increases the rate at which Btz is released from the conjugate. Examples of functional groups that provide a more stable bond include an amide. Examples of functional groups that provide a more labile bond or a less stable or unstable bond include a carbonate group or a carbamate group.",
                                "In other embodiments, the electronics of the linker may contribute to the rate at which the Btz molecule is released from the conjugate. For example, in formula (I) when Z3 is N or in formula (II), the Lewis basicity of the amine bonded to the Btz molecule can be modulated based on the electronics of the linker. In one embodiment, the incorporation of electron donor groups, such as additional methylene groups, in the linker increases the Lewis basicity of the amine, thereby increasing the stability of the bond between the linker and the Btz molecule. In another embodiment, the incorporation of electron withdrawing groups in the linker decreases the Lewis basicity of the amine, thereby decreasing the stability of the bond between the linker and the Btz molecule. In one aspect, the reactivity of compounds of the invention is designed to be tunable to allow for the preparation of sufficiently stable conjugates which will still release Btz efficiently once targeted to bone due to the lower pH in the bone matrix. The high kinetic affinity of bisphosphonates for bone allows for transport to bone to be accomplished without significant degradation of the conjugate and release of the Btz systemically.",
                                "In one embodiment, the linker is aliphatic. In another embodiment, the linker comprises an aromatic ring. Non-limiting examples of aromatic rings include an aryl group or a heteroaryl group. In one embodiment, the aryl group is a phenyl group. In some embodiments, the aromatic ring is substituted. As would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the substituents on the aromatic ring may be selected in order to modify the electronic character of the substituted aromatic ring. For example, electron withdrawing groups may be added to the aromatic ring in order to decrease the electron density of the ring, while electron donating groups may be added in order to increase the electron density of the ring. In some embodiments, altering the electronic character of the ring may be used to modulate the reactivity of the linker, thereby influencing the rate of cleavage between the linker and Btz and thus delivery of the Btz warhead to the desired site.

Non-limiting examples of Notch inhibitors include DAPT (N\u2014[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester) and Thapsigarin ((3S,3aR,4S,6S,6aR,7S,8S,9bS)-6-(acetyloxy)-4-(butyryloxy)-3,3a-dihydroxy-3,6,9-trimethyl-8-{[(2Z)-2-methylbut-2-enoyl]oxy}-2-oxo-2,3,3a,4,5,6,6a,7,8,9b-decahydroazuleno[4,5-b]furan-7-yl octanoate). Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, these results suggest that Notch inhibitors could be used as bone anabolic agents. However, like bortezomib, Notch inhibitors also have severe adverse effects due to systemic distribution (Barten et al., 2006, Drugs R D 7:87-97), limiting their use in common diseases such as osteoporosis. Therefore, the present invention also provides compounds comprising Notch inhibitors with reduced or no systemic toxic side effects."

Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl, in the presence of amines that are blocked with acid labile groups, such as t-butyl carbamate, or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.",

Carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.",

                                "There had previously not been any study of the role of UPS-mediated protein modification in bone repair. However, during the course of studying ubiquitin E3 ligases and osteoblast regulation, it was found that MSCs from mice deficient Smurf1, Wwp1 and Itch (members of the Nedd4 sub-class of E3 ligases) have increased migration, growth and osteoblast (OB) differentiation by increasing the stability of Runx2, JunB and CXCR4 proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Jones et al., 2012, Stem Cells Transl. Med. 1:70-78). Runx2 and JunB are key positive regulators of OB differentiation and CXCR4 is essential for cell migration. Thus, targeting the UPS may represent a new strategy to promote fracture healing by improving MPC function.",
                                "Delivering a drug to bone is a significant challenge in the field of bone research. Many clinically used drugs or compounds have positive effects on OBs in cell cultures, including Bortezomib. However, they cannot be used in the treatment of common bone diseases such as osteoporosis and bone fractures due to severe adverse effects on other cell types via systemic distribution. Furthermore, difficulties in chemistry make it hard to achieve.",
                                "Initial approaches to target drugs to bone with bisphosphonates (BPs) have previously had limited efficacy (Gil et al., 1999, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 7:901-919; Hirabayashi and Fujisaki, 2003, Clin. Pharmacokinet. 42:1319-1330). However, recent attempts to target estrogen analogues (Morioka et al., 2010, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 18:1143-1148), antibiotic agents (Tanaka et al., 2010, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 20:1355-1359), and prostaglandins (Ams et al., 2012, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20:2131-2140) to bone through a carbamate linker conjugation have been more successful specifically through chemical linkages that allow the subsequent release of an active agent at the bone surface. This approach improved the efficacy of estradiol to inhibit bone resorption, while limiting side-effects, such as endometrial hyperplasia (Morioka et al., 2010, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 18:1143-1148). In a related effort, this BP-drug conjugation technology facilitated adequate delivery to bone and the slow release of prostaglandin \u2018warheads\u2019 in radiolabelled PK studies to estimate concentrations of delivered drug (Ams et al., 2012, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20:2131-2140; Liu et al., 2015, J. Bone Min. Res. 30:670-680). Carbamate linkers are cleaved by enzymatic or hydrolytic means in the acidic microenvironment under the osteoclast ruffled border in bone resorption sites, thus releasing the active drug (\u2018warhead/payload\u2019) (Arns et al., 2012, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 20:2131-2140). As demonstrated herein, the use of carbamate linkers has resulted in the delivery of Btz to bone by utilizing the boronic ester functional group of Btz as a linker, which is labile in the presence of the low pH conditions that occur on the bone surface.",
                                "The results described herein demonstrate a bone-targeted conjugate compound comprising Bortezomib, BP-Btz1, used to determine if the Btz released in bone would have anti-osteoclast efficacy at least equivalent to Btz in standard in vitro osteoclast formation assays. As a control, the effects of the non-bioactive bisphosphonate (BP) that would be released in the bone compartment were also studied. In in vitro studies on bone slices, it was demonstrated that the Btz conjugate bearing this boronic ester degradable linker has anti-osteoclast activity equivalent to than Btz itself. In a pivotal in vitro study, this BP-Btz1 and Btz were independently incubated with bone slices for 24 hours, after which the bone slices were removed and placed in culture wells with fresh media along with osteoclast precursors. Formation and activity of osteoclasts derived from these precursors were significantly reduced on the bone slices pre-incubated with the conjugate (1 \u03bcM), but not on those slices pre-incubated with Btz only. These results are consistent with the bisphosphonate component binding to the bone slices during the 24 hour exposure and the Btz being released and taken up subsequently by osteoclast precursors to inhibit their differentiation into osteoclasts. Osteoblast assays were also to demonstrate that similar to Btz, BP-Btz1 stimulates osteoblast differentiation of mouse and human MPCs, indicating that this chemical approach does not affect bone anabolic property of Btz (FIG. 1).",
                                "In vivo studies demonstrate in dose-response experiments that the conjugate BP-Btz1 inhibits bone resorption and stimulates formation at doses lower than effective doses of Btz alone. In vitro testing is also used to examine analogues of BP-Btz1."

All of these knockout mice have increased bone volumes, bone formation, and OB differentiation by causing ubiquitination and degradation of JunB and Runx2 (Weathington and Mallampalli, 2014, J. Clin.

Bone fracture repair is composed of a series of events that involve inflammation, angiogenesis and osteogenesis, which are regulated by multiple mechanisms. However, the role of protein turnover by the UPS in fracture healing has not been explored previously. High expression levels of E3 ligases and Ub-proteins in bone fracture calluses were detected (FIG. 1), indicating that a UPS-mediated cellular event may be involved in the bone repair process, which forms a basis for this application. Nestin-GFP mice were used to label Mesenchymal stem/Progenitor Cells (MPCs) (Mignone et al., 2004, J. Comp. Neurol. 469:311-324; Mendez-Ferrer et al., 2010, Nature 466:829-834) and showed remarkably increased Nestin+ MPCs at early phases of fracture callus.",

It was found that short-term Btz treatment increases fracture healing in mice, accompanying the accumulation of Ub-proteins in facture calluses (FIG. 2), suggesting that Btz may promote bone regeneration. However, clinical information from myeloma therapy indicates that Btz and other proteasome inhibitors including Carfilzomib (marketed as Kyprolis by Onyx Pharmaceuticals) have significant toxicities, such as peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenia, which restrict their utilization. As described herein, conjugates of Btz and bisphosphonates (BPs) are synthesized using a carbamate linker (FIG. 3), thereby avoid any confounding effects associated with direct actions of BPs on osteoclasts and bone destruction.",

These BP-Btz conjugates are tested to examine whether they bind to bone slices and inhibit OC function by culturing OC precursors on bone slices that have been pre-incubated with BP-Btz or Btz.

The release of the Btz from the BP-Btz conjugate will be enhanced while maintaining sufficient stability of the conjugate to allow transport to bone. The BP-Btz conjugates are of two structural classes: 1) amine-stabilized boronate ester complexes BP-Btz2-BP-Btz6 (analogues of BP-Btz1; FIG. 9) and 2) non-amine-stabilized boronate esters BP-Btz7-BP-Btz10 where the linker bears carbamate or amide linkages (FIG. 10).",

Both however, exhibit equal lability at the boronate ester site and thus show similar efficacy overall. Compounds BP-Btz2-BP-Btz6 are linked to BP via a carbamate or amide linkage; the former are cleaved by either enzymatic reaction and/or hydrolysis in an acidic microenvironment, releasing the active drug. Btz is therefore released when BP-Btz2-BP-Btz6 are present in an environment where protease activity and/or acidity is high, such as under the OC ruffled border in bone resorption sites. The analogues bearing the amide linkage are not readily susceptible to proteases, but retain the ability to release Btz via acid catalysed hydrolysis in the acidic environment. These compounds will allow for the determination as to whether one or both of the possible release mechanisms are operating, initially in vitro, and ultimately in vivo.",

The UbG76V-GFP transgene was designed with a chicken beta-actin promoter and CMV immediate early enhancer upstream of a GFP fused to a mutant ubiquitin moiety (UbG76V), a constitutively active proteasome degradation signal. Following proteasome inhibitor administration, UbG76V accumulates and GFP fluorescence is readily apparent. GFP+ OCs were detected at 4 and 8 hrs after adding Btz to OC cultures, which disappeared at 24 hrs. More importantly, it was demonstrated that GFP+ cells were present on bone slices that have been pre-incubated with BP-Btz1, but not Btz or BP (FIG. 5B), indicating the bioactivity of Btz within BP-Btz1.\n\n2.

The number and area of OCs and resorption pits are assessed. The appearance, intensity and distribution of GFP+ cells on bone slices and plastic surrounding bone slices during OC formation is observed and recorded.\n\n3. OB differentiation.

                                "BP-Btz is expected to have a higher efficacy on 1) reducing OVX-induced bone loss and 2) promoting fracture healing in aged mice with lesser adverse systemic effects than those of Btz. A critical difference between BP-Btz and Btz is that in vivo BP-Btz brings Btz to bone, thereby exerting its bioactivity locally, while Btz can exert its bioactivity systemically. It is hypothesized that BP-Btz conjugates should have similar or better positive bioactivities than Btz on bone volume, but with a significant reduction in side effects. In humans, the toxicities of Btz include peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopenis (Weathington and Mallampalli, 2014, J. Clin. Invest. 124:6-12). Little is known the toxicity of Btz in mice. A mouse study reported that Btz injection markedly decreases total and CD4+ and CD8+ thymocyte, but not splenocytes numbers (Maseda et al., 2008, Cell Death Differ. 15:600-612). Low survival rate was observed in aged mice treated with Btz (53% vs. 91% in vehicle), while Btz was not found to influence survival in young mice (94% vs. 100% in vehicle). Although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, these adverse effects are thought to be due to the systemic distribution of the drug. Thus, the generation of bone-targeted Btz could meet a critical clinical need, by and increasing the local drug concentration to capitalize on the efficacy of BTz while reducing systemic side effects. Because proteasome inhibitors could increase bone volume in normal and OVX mice, and promote fracture healing in adult mice (Khedgikar et al., 2013, Cell Death Dis. 4:e778; Maseda et al., 2008, Cell Death Differ. 15:600-612), OVX and fracture models are used to examine the efficacy of the leading BP-Btz conjugates on bone. Aged mice are used in fracture experiments because they often show delayed or fracture nonunion (Naik et al., 2008, J. Bone Min. Res.). Thymocyte number and death are used as outcome measures for systemic adverse effects of Btz. The effect of BP-Btz conjugates and Btz is examined on bone volume, bone formation/resorption markers, OCs and OBs in 3-m-old WT C57/B6 female mice received OVX by \u03bcCT, histology and ELISA assays. The effect of the BP-Btz conjugates on tibial fracture healing of 20-m-old (aged) mice by \u03bcCT, histology, and biomechanical testing is examined. The systemic effects of the compounds on mouse survival is examined by a survival curve and on immune cells in thymus, while bone marrow and spleen will be examined by flow cytometry.",
