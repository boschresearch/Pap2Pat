    "abstract": "The present invention provides use of berbamine dihydrochloride in preparation of an Ebola virus inhibitor. In the present invention, the primed glycoprotein of the Ebola virus (EBOV-GPcl) is taken as a target site, and an antiviral active compound with the capability of binding to the EBOV-GPcl, i.e., berbamine dihydrochloride, is obtained through structure-based virtual screening. Berbamine dihydrochloride can specifically inhibit the entry of an Ebola recombinant virus by binding to the target protein EBOV-GPcl, thereby achieving the effect of anti-Ebola virus infection. The half-maximum effect concentration (EC50) of berbamine dihydrochloride against EBOV is 0.49 \u03bcM, which indicates that berbamine dihydrochloride has a strong inhibition effect on EBOV.",

The common viral hemorrhagic fever includes Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever and smallpox, etc.",

EBOV can be divided into five species: a Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), a Sudanebolavirus (SUDV), a Tai Forest ebolavirus (TAFV), a Bundibugyoebolavirus (BDBV), and a Reston ebolavirus (RESTV).

In the present invention, according to the interaction between EBOV-GPcl (the primed glycoprotein of the Ebola virus) and NPC1-C, by adopting a brand-new drug design method, the inventor designs and synthesizes an active polypeptide which specifically binds to the EBOV-GPcl and can inhibit the Ebola virus from entering a cell. According to a hydrogen bond, electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic interaction, and the like between the active polypeptide and the EBOV-GPcl, the inventor constructs a pharmacophore model, and establishes a virtual screening method for EBOV-GPcl-targeting inhibitors for inhibition the entry of the Ebola virus, in order to find a small-molecular compound that specifically binds to the EBOV-GPcl, thereby inhibiting the binding of the EBOV-GPcl to NPC1-C and further inhibiting the replication of the Ebola virus. A database is screened by using this model, and a target compound is finally obtained through scoring by multiple software. The target compound is detected for a biological activity, and finally an antiviral active compound with the EBOV-GPcl as a target site is obtained. The compound is berbamine dihydrochloride, which has the capacity of binding to EBOV-GPcl.",

Meanwhile, a VSVG/HIV-luc recombinant virus model is used for analyzing the specificity of small molecule compounds. After cytotoxicity is eliminated, the action mechanism of the small-molecule compound is further verified by a drug TOA (Time of addition) experiment. Finally, the capability of the small-molecule compound of binding to the target protein GPcl is determined in vitro by using the BioLayer Interferometry technology based on an optical fiber biosensor, so as to verify the targeting property of the small-molecule compound.

After cytotoxic factors were eliminated, the inhibitory activity of the compound on the VSV-G/HIV-luc pseudovirus was also detected with the same method as above, by using the luciferase principle.

                                "The envelope surface glycoprotein GP of the Ebola virus was subjected to enzyme digestion treatment by a host protease Cathepsin in an endosome, and thus converted into a primed glycoprotein GPcl, so as to expose a receptor binding site. In order to verify that berbamine dihydrochloride specifically inhibited viral entry by binding to the target protein GPcl, the capability of berbamine dihydrochloride of binding to the target protein GPcl was determined in vitro by using a BioLayer Interferometry (BLI) technology based on an optical fiber biosensor. The BLI technology could track the interactions between biomolecules in real time, and was an ideal choice for studying the interactions between proteins and other biomolecules. The specific steps were as follows.",
                                "Since a Super streptavidin (SSA) biosensor was used in the experiment, a biotinylation treatment of the target protein GPcl was required first. Biotin (EZ-Link\u2122 NHS-LC-LC-Biotin, Cat. #21343, ThermoScientific\u2122) was mixed with the purified target protein GPcl according to a molar ratio of 3:1, reacted at room temperature for 1 hour, and then passed through a desalting column (Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Columns, Cat. #89883, Thermo) to remove unreacted biotin, and thus a biotinylated target protein GPcl was obtained.",
                                "Combined with the experiment, and by using an Octet RED96 (ForteBio, Inc., CA, USA) instrument, the experiment was mainly carried out by the following steps: 1) detecting a baseline: immersing a SSA sensor into a buffer solution and standing for 120 s to reach an equilibrium; 2) incubating the biotinylated target protein GPcl onto the sensor: moving a sensor probe into the biotinylated GPcl protein solution (50 \u03bcg/ml) and standing for 600 s to fix the protein on the SSA sensor; 3) blocking the sensor: moving the sensor into a solution containing 5 \u03bcM biocytin (EZ-Biocytin, Cat. #28022, Thermo) and blocking for 60 s; 4) detecting the baseline for the second time: moving the sensor into a buffer solution and standing for 120 s to reach an equilibrium; 5) binding: moving the sensor into the compound solution and standing for 60 s to measure a Kon value; and 6) dissociating: moving the sensor into the buffer solution and standing for 60 s to obtain a Koff value. The buffer solution used in the experiment was PBS (for dissolution of protein) and PBS+5% DMSO (for dissolution of berbamine dihydrochloride). In this experiment, the sample loading and detection were carried out separately. A first microplate contained 3 columns, where the first column was PBS as a baseline, the second column was the biotinylated target protein GPcl for sample loading, and the third column was 5 \u03bcM biocytin for blocking. After sample loading, the sensor detected a second microplate, where the first to sixth columns were PBS+5% DMSO, and the seventh to twelfth columns were berbamine dihydrochloride with a concentration gradient from low to high concentrations (31.25 \u03bcM-500 \u03bcM). In this process, 5 different concentrations of berbamine dihydrochloride solutions were used to obtain the final kinetic curves. The experimental data was analyzed by using a ForteBio data analysis software DataAnalysis 9.0. The dissociation rate constant KD=Koff/Kon.",
                                "The horizontal ordinate in FIG. 7 was the reaction time in seconds. The vertical ordinate was the signal intensity in nm of the interaction between GPcl and berbamine dihydrochloride. The results showed that berbamine dihydrochloride could bind to the GPcl protein.",
                                "Although the anti-virus mechanism of the technical solution of the present invention is specifically illustrated by taking EBVO as an example in the present invention, the claimed scope of the present invention for use of berbamine dihydrochloride or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is not limited to EBOV. Any virus suitable for the above anti-virus mechanism is within the scope of the virus described in the present invention. For example, it can be other four subtypes of EBOV, and other viruses of filoviridae such as the Marburg virus, the Lassa virus (LASV), etc.",

Although specific embodiments of the present invention have been given, it should be understood that the present invention can be further modified. In summary, according to the principle of the present invention, this application is intended to encompass any change to, use of, or modification to the present invention, including changes, which have departed from the scope disclosed in this application, as made by using conventional techniques known in the art.
