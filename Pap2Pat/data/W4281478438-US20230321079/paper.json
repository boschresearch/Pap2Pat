                "We previously characterized the NPC1-binding site in GPcl, consisting of residues V79, T83, K84, F88, I113, V141, and P146 (24) (Fig. 1a). Based on this result, we designed a virtual screening strategy, as shown in Fig. 1b, and systematically examined 4114 compounds from the focused small compound libraries, and ranked these compounds based on the predicted binding free energies (\u0394GADV). A total of 334 compounds had a \u0394GADV lower than -9.0 kcal/mol (Extended Data Fig. S1) and were further visually inspected for H-bond, p-p, or salt bridge interactions to discard unrealistic poses with unreasonably high score. A final list of 46 compounds (Extended Data Table. S1) were selected for further study.",
                "We first assessed the inhibitory effect of the selected 46 compounds on infection of HIV-Luc reporter virus that was pseudotyped with EBOV GP (EBOV pseudoparticle, EBOVpp) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) GP (VSV pseudoparticle, VSVpp), as we described previously (24). Of these 46 compounds, EEI-10 (Fig. 1c), EEI-33 and EEI-45 (Extended Data Fig. S2) exhibited more than 80% inhibition of EBOVpp infection, but less than 20% reduction in VSVpp infectivity, which suggests that these three compounds selectively block EBOV GP-mediated viral entry. Such a selective inhibition was also observed for the known EBOV entry inhibitor tetrandrine (thereafter called TET) (17). Next, we determined the binding affinity of the selected compounds to the purified GPcl in vitro in the BLI binding assay. The association and dissociation data suggest that only EEI-10 and EEI-20 interacted directly with GPcl with a KD of 217 \u03bcM and 229 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. S3). Together, among the 46 compounds tested, only EEI-10 both binds to GPcl and selectively inhibits EBOV GP-mediated viral entry. EEI-10, also called berbamine hydrochloride, is a natural compound extracted from the berberis amurensis and has been used in the clinic to treat leukopenia (25). Repurposing of an approved drug to inhibit EBOV represents a great opportunity of developing new anti-EBOV drugs. We thus decided to further characterize EEI-10 inhibition of EBOV. First, we observed that EEI-10 profoundly inhibited EBOVpp but not VSVpp (Fig. 1e). Results of dose-response experiments revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of EBOVpp in 293T cells with EC50 of 0.49 \u03bcM (Fig. 1f). No cytotoxic effect of EEI-10 was observed even at 10 \u03bcM (Extended Data Fig. S4a). Importantly, EEI-10 potently suppressed EBOV infection of Vero E6 cells (EC50=4.1 \u03bcM, EC90 =7.6 \u03bcM) (Fig. 1g), and did not affect cell viability at the concentrations used (Extended Data Fig. S4b). These data together suggest that EEI-10 is a potent EBOV inhibitor. Left, the structure of the GPcl (yellow) in complex with NPC1 (green). Right, the receptor binding cavity at the top of GPcl.",

                "To determine whether EEI-10 inhibits EBOV GP-mediated virus entry, we first performed a time-of-addition experiment using EBOVpp. EEI-10 was added at different time points before and after EBOVpp infection. The results showed that both EEI-10 and TET markedly inhibited viral infection at the early time points of drug addition, and their inhibitory effects decreased after 4 hpi (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz (EFV) maintained its inhibitory effect up to 8 hpi. We further measured the possible effect of EEI-10 on the internalization of EBOVpp from the cell surface by quantifying the uptake of viral genomic RNA, and observed no effect as opposed to the marked inhibition by heparin (Fig. 2b), which has been shown to block the early attachment of EBOV to the target cells (26). These data support that EEI-10 inhibits an early step of EBOVpp infection, after EBOV GP-mediated internalization from the cell surface but prior to viral RNA replication.",
                "It is known that following internalization at the cell surface, EBOV particles translocate to the acidic late endosomes where virus-cell membrane fusion occurs, leading to the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm (27,28). Imaging EBOVpp-infected cell at 4 hpi revealed a similar number of virions in the LAMP1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1)-positive late endosome/lysosome compartments in cells treated with either EEI-10 or control DMSO (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. S5). This further supports the data in Figure 2b that EEI-10 does not affect the early events of virus entry from uptake of virus at the cell surface to trafficking of virions to the acidic compartments. We next tested whether the fusion of viral and cellular membranes is inhibited by EEI-10 using a beta-lactamase-Vpr chimeric protein (BlaM-Vpr) release assay that has been established to measure the delivery of HIV-1 core into the cytoplasm (29). We found that EEI-10 significantly reduced the cytoplasmic entry of BlaM-Vpr from EBOVpp by approximate 80%, whereas no such effect of EEI-10 was observed for VSVpp (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. S6). This suggests that EEI-10 specifically inhibits the delivery of BlaM-Vpr into the cytoplasm resulting from EBOV GP-mediated membrane fusion. In further support of this conclusion, adding MG132 to cell culture for preventing the degradation of incoming virion, a pronounced increase was detected in the level of EBOVpp particles in newly infected cells treated with either EEI-10 or TET, but not for VSVpp infection (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. S7), suggesting that EEI-10-mediated delay of virus entry at the late endosomes causes accumulation of EBOVpp particles.

                "We next determined whether EEI-10 inhibits EBOV GP-mediated entry by disrupting the binding of GP to its receptor NPC1 in the infected cell. We first observed that that EEI-10 treatment reduced the colocalization of EBOVpp particles with NPC1 in the infected cells (Fig. 3a), as opposed to TET which targets the two-pore channels and had no effect as previously reported (17). EBOV GP can only bind to NPC1 after cleavage by the endosomal cathepsin. We thus pretreated EBOVpp with the protease thermolysin, which completes GP cleavage (8), and then infected cells in the presence of EEI-10. Again, strong inhibition was observed with EEI-10 but not with cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (Fig. 3b). Thus, EEI-10 diminishes the colocalization of EBOVpp with NPC1 not through affecting GP proteolysis. We next performed co-immunoprecipitation to measure the association of GPcl with its receptor NPC1 and found that EEI-10, but not TET, markedly reduced GPcl-NPC1 interaction (Fig. 3c). This observation was supported by the data of proximity ligation assay (PLA), showing that treatment with EEI-10 diminished GPcl-NPC1 interaction in the infected cells by approximately 80% (Fig. 3d). We further showed that EEI-10 did not affect the cellular content of cholesterol (Extended Data Fig. S8) in contrast with NPC1 inhibitors U18666A and compound 3.0 that inhibited EBOV entry by causing cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes, suggesting that EEI-10 does not act on NPC1.",
                "We thus conclude that EEI-10 binds to GPcl, prevents GPcl from binding NPC1, and inhibits GP-mediated fusion of viral and cellular membranes. "

            "paragraphs": [
                "We next used the AutoDock Vian computation program to model the binding of EEI-10 to GPcl. In the generated model of GPcl in complex with EEI-10 (Fig. 4a), EEI-10 is located at the hydrophobic pocket in GPcl and forms hydrogen bond interaction with the amino residue E112. We further employed the MM/GBSA computation approach to calculate the binding free energy of EEI-10 and decomposed the free energy at the amino acid level. The cavity analysis showed that the major contributing amino acids to the binding of EEI-10 include E112, T83, I113, V141, F88, L111, W86, V79, P80, and G143, which are ranked based on their \u0394GADV in the range from -2.54 to -0.62 kcal/mol (Extended Data Table. S2).",
                "To validate this binding model, we mutated the three top-ranking amino acids E112, T83 and I113, and examined their effect on the sensitivity of EBOV GP-mediated entry to EEI-10. The E112A mutation severely impaired viral infectivity, thus was not further tested for EEI-10 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. S9). The I113A GP mutant was refractory to EEI-10 while remaining sensitive to the TET entry inhibitor (Fig. 4b). In the meantime, the T83A mutation exerted no effect on the sensitivity of GP to either EEI-10 or TET inhibition (Fig. 4b); this is likely because A83 is able to restore the van der Waals interaction with EEI-10 which is observed for T83 as predicted in our computation model (Extended Data Table . 2). These data demonstrate that I113 is a key residue in contact with EEI-10 and that its mutation leads to resistance to EEI-10, which supports the structural model of GPcl binding to EEI-10.",
                "Recent studies have revealed a common receptor-binding site in GPs of several filoviruses including EBOV and MARV (13,30), which suggests that EEI-10 may inhibit MARV infection as well. Indeed, EEI-10 inhibited the MARV-GP/HIV-luc virus infection at an EC50 = 0.99 \u03bcM, and inhibited MARV itself at an EC50 = 4.06 \u03bcM (Fig. 4c,d). We further conducted computational docking of EEI-10 to MARV-GP1 and then preformed MD simulation to relax the complex. The binding free energy of the MARV GP/EEI-10 was calculated as \u0394GADV=-9.3kcal/mol, which is moderately higher than that of EBOV-GPcl/EEI-10 complex (\u0394GADV=-10.9 kcal/mol). Notably, these two complexes are well superposed at the EEI-10 binding sites (Fig. 4e). The top 10 amino acids in MARV-GP1 that contribute most to the binding energies are L64, S67, K68, A71, F72, I95, V97, I125, G127, and N129 (Extended Data Table. S3), which are equivalent to P80, T83, K84, G87, F88, L111, I113, V141, G143, and G145 in EBOV GPcl. Importantly, seven of the top 10 major contributing amino residues are shared in both complexes (Fig. 4f). These data suggest that EEI-10 is able to bind to the GPs of EBOV and MARV, and inhibit both viruses. "

                "Finally, we asked whether EEI-10 was able to protect mice from lethal EBOV infection. Mice were treated orally once per day for 6 days with 100 mg/kg EEI-10 beginning the day prior to inoculation with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) (Fig. 5a). Remarkably, 100% of the mice treated with EEI-10 survived infection while only one of the PBS-treated animals survived (Fig. 5b), although all exhibited weight loss (Fig. 5c). To determine whether EEI-10 was also effective if treatment was begun post-infection, mice were again inoculated with MA-EBOV and then treated orally with the same dose of drug beginning at 1 day post-infection for a period of 6 days. Whereas all PBS-treated mice succumbed to infection by day 7, nearly all mice treated with EEI-10 survived, and the time to death was prolonged in the single treated animal that died (Fig. 5d). Again, all animals exhibited weight loss (Fig. 5e), suggesting that, while EEI-10 treatment provided a significant survival advantage, it did not prevent some signs of disease. This remarkable protective efficacy of EEI-10 may be partially attributed to the relatively weak interaction of GPcl with its receptor NPC1. With a KD of 158 \u03bcM, as measured in vitro using recombinant proteins (31), the interaction between these two proteins was likely easily disrupted by EEI-10. Through medicinal chemistry to modify EEI-10 and select for variants with greater affinity to GPcl, we expect to identify EEI-10 derivatives exhibiting much stronger inhibition of EBOV as well as a higher genetic barrier to deter the development of viral resistance. Additionally, as a drug to treat leukopenia, EEI-10 is expected to modulate certain cellular pathways and host immunity, which may have also contributed to its protection of mice against lethal EBOV infection.",
                "Of note, EEI-10 was demonstrated to bind to EBOV GPcl and potently inhibit virus entry, whereas in vitro binding assay revealed that EEI-10 exhibited a low affinity for GPcl, with KD values above 100 \u00b5M (Fig. 1d), likely due to the inability of the molecule to fit into and fully fill the extremely large receptor binding cavity (Fig. 1a). Nevertheless, a similar affinity (KD = 158 \u03bcM) was reported in the complex structure of GPcl bound to NPC1 (31), suggesting the feasibility of EEI-10 to compete with NPC1 for binding to GPcl. Moreover, lower pH was reported to enhance the interaction between GPcl and NPC1 (9). This implies that the binding affinity of EEI-10 in the acidic endosome where it occurs may be underrated in vitro.",
                "In summary, we have identified a natural compound berbamine hydrochloride (EEI-10) that potently inhibits EBOV infection of cultured cells through direct binding to viral GPcl and impairing the interaction of GPcl with the viral receptor NPC1. Our data further showed that EEI-10 strongly inhibits another pathogenic filovirus, MARV, implicating the potential use of EEI-10 as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of filovirus infection.",
                "Given that berbamine hydrochloride is already approved to treat leukopenia and has been thoroughly evaluated for its safety and pharmacokinetics properties, this drug holds great promise for saving the lives of EBOV patients and preventing future EBOV epidemics or pandemics.",
