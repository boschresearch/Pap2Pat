                        "Notch signaling is an inter-cellular communication system that plays a key role in regulating biological processes of primary importance, such as self-maintenance and stem cell differentiation in embryonic development and in homeostasis in different tissues of the adult organism.",
                        "In mammals, the Notch family comprises four trans-membrane receptors (Notch1-4), highly conserved from an evolutionary point of view, and five ligands (Jagged-1, -2, Delta-like-1, -3 and -4).",
                        "Notch signaling activation occurs through the interaction of the extracellular domain of a Notch receptor, expressed on the membrane of a cell receiving the signal, with a ligand present on the membrane of a signaling cell. Interaction with the ligand predisposes the Notch receptor to two consecutive proteolytic cuts, by the enzymatic action of the TACE complex (ADAM metalloprotease TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme) before, and of the gamma-secretase complex after, which culminate with the release of the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which moves into the nucleus and promotes the expression of specific target genes.",
                        "The constitutive activation of the pathway, due to mutations, gene amplifications or post-translational changes to Notch receptors, is directly related to the development, progression, angiogenesis, and poor prognosis in a large number of oncologic pathologies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).",
                        "Therefore, one of the objectives of the research, aimed at developing innovative therapies for curing T-ALL, is the pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling.",
                        "In this context, to date, the most promising approach and the examination of several clinical trials involves blocking the proteolytic cut of the Notch receptor that leads to the release of the activated domain through treatment with small molecules of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Unfortunately, as revealed by clinical studies, potential clinical applications of GSIs in anti-tumor therapies are limited by primary resistance and/or side effects associated with the treatments. In particular, it has been shown that exposure to GSIs often accompanies the onset of metaplasia of the goblet cells of the intestine.",
                        "A second strategy, alternative to the use of GSIs, involves the use of selectively directed monoclonal antibodies against Notch receptors and/or ligands, but this approach also has intrinsic limits. The efficacy of the action of ligand-competitive antibodies is closely related to the expression levels of the receptors and their ligands, and the different affinity of the four Notch receptors for the respective ligands. Furthermore, the therapeutic use of antibodies may be ineffective in T-ALL subgroups in which the signaling is constitutively activated due to chromosomal translocations or Notch gene mutations.",
                        "Given the high number of diseases and tumors associated with the deregulation of the Notch pathway, it is even more necessary to develop new, efficient, specific and safe therapies directed at the inhibition of this signaling in order to effectively counteract resistance, recurrence and metastatization phenomena in different solid and hematologic tumors including T-ALL."

                        "In recent years, scientific and industrial interest has been progressively increasing in relation to small naturally-occurring molecules, bio-pharmacologically active in various pathological contexts including neoplastic diseases. In this context, in addition to all the molecules proposed as gamma-secretase inhibitors, various naturally-occurring molecules have been proposed as potentially new anti-tumor agents capable of suppressing Notch signaling.",
                        "In the present study, a library of about one thousand naturally-occurring compounds, isolated from plants known for their use in traditional medicine, and their chemical derivatives, were grouped into clusters according to a chemo-informatics approach.",
                        "The clustering of the library according to this method allowed the obtainment of groups of chemically and pharmacologically similar molecules, for each of which a representative molecule (A-H) has been identified, illustrated in Table 1.",
                        "In order to detect small molecules able to modulate the Notch signal transduction pathway, the effects on the endogenous activation of Notch signaling and on cell proliferation in stabilized human lines of T-ALL were evaluated, known to be sensitive to the block of Notch signaling for each representative molecule of each of the eight clusters (A-H).",
                        "The cross-analysis of the results obtained from biochemical and functional assays indicated the molecule 3,4,2\u2032, 4\u2032-tetrahydroxychalcone (butein, C) as a new and potent inhibitor of Notch signaling able to significantly inhibit cell proliferation at low concentrations. In this regard, the inventors of the present application have verified that short exposure times to the molecule C significantly repress both the proliferation and the endogenous activation of the Notch1 receptor starting from a concentration between 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM, with a dose-dependent effect in human T-ALL cell lines.",
                        "In order to enhance the activity and selectivity of action of butein (C), the present inventors have designed a number of structural analogues of butein, which have been synthesized and tested in vitro.",

The patent application US-A-2015/0175548 discloses a molecule similar to nifedipine, with comparable anti-proliferative activity, albeit slightly less efficient, to that of compound 8.

Functional biochemical screening was performed on T-ALL DND41 cells because they are notoriously sensitive to the block of Notch signaling, and characterized by the constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the Notch1 pathway and by the high expression of Notch3. This makes this cell line a useful experimental model for screening putative Notch inhibitors.",
                                "Among the eight molecules considered, molecule C revealed the highest inhibitory activity against Notch signaling, as shown by the decreased expression of N1VAL and N3ICD at concentrations ranging from 5 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM (FIG. 1). On the other hand, treatments with the molecules D, E, F and G did not significantly modulate the expression of N1VAL, while A, B and H reduce its expression at very high concentrations (between 20 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) (FIG. 1).",

Consistent with the high inhibitory activity of Notch, exposure to molecule C dramatically reduces cell proliferation in DND41 cells at concentrations comparable to those sufficient to inhibit Notch signaling (IG50 of 7.79\u00b11.73 \u03bcM) (Table 1). Conversely, compounds B and H show a low anti-proliferative activity with IG50 values of 13.89\u00b12.70 \u03bcM and 22.64\u00b11.89 \u03bcM, respectively, while the molecules A, D, E, F and G do not significantly affect cell proliferation at doses of up to 50 \u03bcM.

Given that molecule C emerged from the first screening as a promising hit, a second generation of chemical derivatives (Table 2) was designed and synthesized in order to increase the biological activity, to remove the catecholic group (Schweigert et al., 2001) that is very sensitive to oxidation reactions, and to outline the structure-activity relationships (SAR). The general synthetic strategy used to prepare chalcones is based on the Claisen-Schmidt condensation (FIG. 2) (Sogawa et al., 1994).",

Conversely, all the other 11 synthetic derivatives modulate the expression levels of the two receptor domains at higher concentrations (FIG. 3). In support of the high inhibitory activity of Notch, cell proliferation assays in response to increasing doses of the synthetic compounds demonstrated that compound 8 is the most potent repressor of proliferation. Treatments with compound 8 repress proliferation with IG50=1.92 \u03bcM\u00b10.14 \u03bcM, while all the other chemical derivatives present anti-proliferative activities that are 10 to 20 times weaker, as demonstrated by IG50 values greater than 11 \u03bcM (Table 1). Given the high power of action at low micromolar concentrations of compound 8, subsequent functional and biological comparison analyses between compound 8 and the additional 14 compounds illustrated in Table 2 were carried out by adding two intermediate concentrations (0.5 \u03bcM and 2.5 \u03bcM) in dose-response assays (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 \u03bcM). Among the 14 compounds of Table 2, only molecules 16 and 17 showed inhibitory activity of Notch signaling in a range of concentrations comparable to those disclosed for compound 8 (at doses of 2.5 \u03bcM) (FIG. 4). The subsequent comparative analysis of the effects of 36 hours of treatment with compounds 8, 16 and 17 on the protein expression of N1VAL and N3ICD finally confirmed compound 8 as the most potent Notch inhibitor (FIG. 5). In addition, compound 8 is the most effective antiproliferative agent compared to all the synthetic derivatives tested, including 16 and 17, which reveal IG50 values greater than 13 \u03bcM (Table 2).",

As confirmation of its efficacy on the inhibition of Notch signaling, 36 hours of treatment with compound 8 reduced N1VAL expression levels in KOPTK1 cells and N3ICD in TALL-1 cells, in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 6A). The KOPTK1 cell line is characterized by constitutive Notch1 activation, due to gene mutations of Notch1, while the TALL-1 cell line, due to mutations of the Notch3 gene, has constitutively active signaling of the Notch3 receptor.",

The SAR was processed and graphically represented (FIG. 7), based on three structural levels of the chalcone base skeleton: ring A, ring B and the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl system.",
                                "Regarding ring A, methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 2\u2032 improves the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, only when ring B is not replaced by hydroxyl groups at position 4. Under these conditions, the presence of the methoxyl group at position 4\u2032 provides a greater activity with respect to the steric mole of the tetrahydropyranyl protecting group. Therefore, it is apparent from the structure of compound 8 that the hydroxylic substitutions act synergically at positions 2\u2032 and 4 of the chalcone scaffold. Based on this evidence, the single replacement on ring A (14, 15 and 17) at different positions reduces biological activity with respect to the rings with double replacement at position 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 (8 and 16). In addition, single-replacement derivatives have shown a comparable inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, although methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 4\u2032 dramatically reduces the expression levels of N1VAL and N3ICD with respect to compound 8, unlike that observed for chalcones with a single-replacement at position 2\u2032 (14 and 15).",
                                "In particular, the activity of chalcone derivatives seems to be significantly dependent on the replacement of ring B. Indeed, comparing the chalcones having the same ring A, the hydroxyl group improves the biological activity, particularly when inserted at position 4, playing a key role in reducing both cell proliferation activity and Notch expression (8).",
                                "Finally, reducing the double bond of the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl system completely abolishes the biological efficacy, suggesting that the reduced molecular flexibility required to ensure the distance between the phenyl rings A and B is more suitable for inducing Notch inhibition.",
