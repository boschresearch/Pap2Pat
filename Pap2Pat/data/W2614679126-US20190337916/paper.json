    "title": "Identification of a novel chalcone derivative that inhibits Notch signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
    "date": "2017-05-19",
    "abstract": "Notch signaling is considered a rational target in the therapy of several cancers, particularly those harbouring Notch gain of function mutations, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although currently available Notch-blocking agents are showing anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, they are not effective in all the patients and often cause severe side-effects, limiting their widespread therapeutic use. Here, by functional and biological analysis of the most representative molecules of an in house library of natural products, we have designed and synthetized the chalcone-derivative 8 possessing Notch inhibitory activity at low micro molar concentration in T-ALL cell lines. Structure-activity relationships were afforded for the chalcone scaffold. Short term treatments with compound 8 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of Notch signaling activity, halted cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis, thus affecting leukemia cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate that 8 is a novel Notch inhibitor, candidate for further investigation and development as an additional therapeutic option against Notch-dependent cancers.",

                "The Notch signaling pathway is an inter-cellular communication system driving many biological processes starting from stem cells self-renewal up to cell differentiation, proliferation and survival in different tissues and in a wide spectrum of organisms1. The mammalian Notch family includes four highly evolutionarily conserved trans-membrane receptors (Notch1\u20134) and five canonical ligands (Jagged-1, and -2, Delta-like-1, -3 and -4).",
                "Notch proteins are synthetized as immature precursors in Endoplasmic Reticulum. Following the proteolytic cleavage by Furin-like convertase (S1 cleavage) in the trans-Golgi, mature Notch receptors accumulate on cell surface as heterodimers composed of the Notch extracellular domain (NECD), the transmembrane domain (NTM) and the intracellular domain (NICD), held together by non-covalent interactions. Notch signaling-induced trans-activation is triggered by the contact between a membrane-associated ligand on the signal-sending cell and a Notch trans-membrane receptor on the signal-receiving cell. The interaction with the ligand predisposes the Notch receptor to the cleavage by ADAM metalloproteases (S2 cleavage), that allows the subsequent cleavage by gamma secretase (GS) complex (S3 cleavage). S3 cleavage leads to the release of active NICD from the membrane, which translocates to the nucleus and regulates the transcription of specific target genes2.",
                "Deregulated Notch signaling due to either gene mutation or amplification, or to post-translational modifications, contributes to development and progression of different solid and hematological cancers, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)3, by directly driving the expression of several oncogenes and cell cycle-related factors4\u20137, and indirectly by cross-talking with other critical oncogenic signaling pathways8\u201312.",
                "T-ALL arises in the thymus from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors and is one of the most aggressive blood cancers, which accounts for approximately 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although T-ALL prognosis has gradually improved, thanks to the available chemotherapeutic protocols, to date the fate of patients with primary therapy-resistant or relapsed leukemia remains unfavourable13, 14.",
                "Several Notch-blocking agents have been developed up to preclinical research and a number of them have been moved to clinical trials for the therapy of Notch-driven tumors, including T-ALL15. In this respect, it is worth noting that the most promising pharmacologic approach to block Notch signaling relies in the suppression of the S3 cleavage operated by GS, which leads to the generation of the NICD. Unfortunately, as revealed by clinical trials, the potential clinical applications of GS inhibitors (GSIs) is limited by primary resistance and/or by severe side effects, especially those occurring within the gastrointestinal tract16.",
                "In the last decade, naturally occurring chemotypes re-emerged as lead candidates for anticancer therapy17\u201320 and, a number of natural products affecting Notch gene expression have been suggested as potential anti-cancer Notch inhibitors21\u201323.",
                "In the present study, an in house library composed of about one thousand natural products and their chemical derivatives24\u201327 was clustered based on fingerprints and substructure search through a cheminformatics approach28. The representative compounds of the eight most populated clusters have been screened by functional, biological and biochemical investigations, for their strength in impairing Notch signaling activity and cell growth in Notch-dependent human T-ALL cell lines. The 2\u2032,3,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxychalcone (molecule C, butein) emerged as valuable hit compound, thus emphasizing the relevance of the chalcone scaffold in Notch inhibition. However, the molecule contains a catechol moiety, which is susceptible for oxidation both in vitro and in vivo, providing possible off-target effects29. Therefore, cycles of design-synthesis-bioassay and testing in vitro were established to optimize the potency of initial chalcone hit, and to eliminate or mask the undesirable chemical feature. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) were afforded, and a novel potent Notch inhibitor, namely 8, was identified and characterized. Compound 8 short term and low dose treatments inhibited the endogenous Notch signaling activity and suppressed cell growth of several human T-ALL cell lines by promoting apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest.",
                "Interestingly, compound 8 inhibits Notch signaling without interfering with S2 and S3 proteolytic cleavages, depending on ADAM and GS, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest molecule 8 as a novel Notch inhibitor candidate for further investigation and development."

To this end, a diversity-oriented random selection (DORS) of compounds was performed by means of a clustering algorithm, which is based on a combination of fingerprints and common substructure (adapted from that developed by Stahl and Mauser)28. The representative molecules of the eight most abundant clusters were selected for this work (Table\u00a01), based on physical availability at the time of the experiments, hit-like features31, and chemical diversity criteria.Table 1Structure and inhibitory activity of natural compounds A\u2013H.CompoundChemical structureIC50\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D.

Treatments with compounds D, E, F and G did not influence the expression of the activated domain of Notch1, as revealed by western blot by using the antibody against the Valine 1744 (N1VAL), whereas the exposure to compounds A, B and H resulted in its decrease only at high doses (between 20\u2009\u03bcM and 50\u2009\u03bcM).

Thus, we evaluated the growth sensitivity of DND41 T cells to these compounds by determining the half-maximal growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) by MTS cell assay.

Among them, compound 8 revealed improved potency and specificity of action compared to chalcone C, as it decreased N1VAL and N3ICD protein expression levels at the lowest micro molar doses (between 1\u2009\u03bcM and 5\u2009\u03bcM). In contrast, all the remaining synthetic derivatives modulated N1VAL and N3ICD expression levels at higher doses than the hit chalcone C (Fig.\u00a04). Accordingly, dose\u2013response cell proliferation assay proved that compound 8 was the most effective molecule in impairing DND41 T-cell growth, with an IC50 value of 1.92\u2009\u03bcM\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u2009\u03bcM. All the other chemical derivatives were 10\u201320 times weaker than compound 8, as they showed IC50 values higher than 11\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a02).

The treatments with the remaining derivatives of 8 resulted in weaker inhibition of Notch signaling activity, as all of them decreased N1VAL and N3ICD expressions at doses higher than 5\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a0S3a). Moreover, the subsequent close comparison of the Notch inhibitory potency at 2.5\u2009\u03bcM between compounds 8, 16 and 17 confirmed, among them, 8 as the strongest Notch signaling inhibitor (Fig.\u00a0S4). In addition, compound 8 confirmed the strongest biological activity as reflected by the cell growth curves and the relative IC50 values, in response to increasing doses of all the synthetic derivatives (Figs\u00a0S3b and 2). Indeed, all derivatives of 8, including 16 and 17, showed IC50 values higher than 13\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a02).

Three structural levels were identified by analyzing functional and biological data: ring A, ring B and \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl system of the chalcone scaffold.",
                        "Concerning ring A, methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 2\u2032 improved the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation only when ring B is not substituted with hydroxyl group at position 4. In this condition, the presence of methoxyl group at position 4\u2032 provides higher activity than the hindered tetrahydropyranyl protecting group. Therefore, since chalcone 8 is the most potent Notch inhibitor of the series, the 2\u2032 and 4-hydroxy groups seem to act synergistically. Based on this evidence, the mono substitution of ring A in different positions (14, 15 and 17) originates weaker chalcones compared to the 2\u2032,4\u2032-substitutions (8 and 16). Finally, mono substituted derivatives showed similar inhibitory effect on cell viability, even though the 4\u2032-methoxy group (17) drastically reduced the N1VAL and N3ICD expression in a comparable extent to 8, and in contrast to what observed for 2\u2032-substituted chalcones (14 and 15) (Figs\u00a05 and S3).",

In fact, comparing chalcones bearing the same ring A, the hydroxyl group improved the activity of the molecules particularly when it is inserted at position 4 of ring B, which proved to be critical for reducing both cell proliferation and Notch expression (8) (Figs\u00a05 and S3).",

We observed a significant accumulation of cells in G1 phase following compound 8-treatment in all the cell lines analysed (Figs\u00a07a and S10). Concomitantly, we detected a substantial decreased expression of proteins involved in G1-S checkpoint progression, Cyclin D3 and the related kinases CDK4, accompanied by increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 which act as an inhibitor of G1-S transition (Fig.\u00a07b). These data are consistent with the G1 cell cycle arrest previously observed after Notch1 pharmacological blockage by GSI treatment in Notch-driven T-cell leukaemia32, 41.

These data were further confirmed by the increased levels of the cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP (Fig.\u00a07d).Figure 7Compound 8-treatment halts cell cycle in G1 phase and induces apoptosis in human T-ALL cells. T-ALL cell lines were treated for 36\u2009hrs with compound 8 or with vehicle alone (DMSO) as indicated: DND41 and KOPTK1 with 2.5\u2009\u03bcM of 8 and TALL-1 with 1\u2009\u03bcM of 8. Cell cycle progression was investigated by FACS analysis of DNA content after 7AAD staining.

(b) Protein expression levels of Cyclin D3, CDK4 and p27 in DND41, KOPTK1 and TALL-1 cells treated with compound 8 or with vehicle alone (DMSO). Compound 8-induced apoptosis rate and cell death were investigated by FACS analysis after Annexin V and 7AAD staining in DND41, KOPTK1 and TALL-1 cells. (c) Histograms show the mean of cell percentage\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. of early and late apoptotic cells of at least four independent experiments. *P\u2009<\u20090.05; **P\u2009<\u20090.01; ns not significant.

This observation is in line with the GSI-dependent marked growth arrest previously reported in long terms of exposures (3\u20137 days) and not described in short terms treatments in T-ALL contexts3, 42, 43.",
                        "Finally, to further evaluate whether 8-induced anti-growth effects in T-ALL are via Notch signaling inhibition, we treated with compound 8 DND41 cells transduced with retroviruses encoding murine N1ICD (mICN1) or with the relative empty retroviral vector (empty). Strength of transduction was evaluated by western blot against N1ICD (Fig.\u00a08a). mICN1 enforced expression partially rescued the anti-proliferative effects induced by compound 8 in DND41 cells when compared to the control cells (Fig.\u00a08b).Figure 8Compound 8 impairs cell growth through Notch inhibition.

                "Increasing evidence indicates that the selective targeting of signaling pathways controlling Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) self-behavior is a promising strategy to improve the effectiveness of the conventional anti-cancer chemo- and radio-therapies.",
                "In the last few years, Notch signaling has been demonstrated to be essential in CSCs maintenance and self-renewal in several human tumors including T-ALL44, 45, thus providing the rationale for developing novel Notch inibitor-based therapies to prevent drug-resistance, recurrence and metastasis in solid and hematologic cancers, characterized by deregulated Notch signaling15. Current clinical investigations with regard to Notch inhibition in cancer are mostly focused on small molecules with GSI activity or on monoclonal antibodies (mABs) targeting specific Notch receptors and ligands46, 47, but although favourable outcomes are expected, both approaches show drawbacks that limit their widespread therapeutic use. Actually, GSIs are not Notch selective as they block the cleavage of a wide variety of trans-membrane proteins48. In addition, not all T-ALL harbouring Notch1 activating mutations are sensitive to GSI36, 43 and the treatment with GSIs often causes serious adverse side effects in patients49, 50. On the other hand, although mAbs have highly specific target selectivity, they show poor tissue and cell membrane penetration and mostly act on target antigens secreted by or expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Given the number of Notch deregulated signaling-related diseases and cancers, other than T-ALL leukemia, there is an urgent need to develop novel efficient and safe Notch-blocking therapies.",
                "Following a DORS approach in silico, we identify here the 2\u2032,3,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxychalcone (C) as a profitable Notch signaling inhibiting agent. Consistently with previous reports showing anti-proliferative properties of chalcones against numerous cancer cells51, 52, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia53, 54, we found a strict correlation between the C-induced Notch signaling blockage and the relative cellular response. Indeed, we found that short time exposure to molecule C substantially suppresses in a dose-dependent manner Notch1 activation and cell growth in human T-ALL cell lines exerting its biochemical and biological activities starting from concentration between 5 and 10\u2009\u03bcM.",
                "Accordingly, the chalcone scaffold emerged as a valuable tool for the design and synthesis of novel chalcone derivatives endowed with higher potency and most suitable pharmacological properties than the hit compound C. Twenty-six chalcones were synthesized and tested in vitro, highlighting the molecule 8 as the most potent Notch blocking agent of the series. Compound 8, as well DAPT, suppresses endogenous Notch signaling activity in a short term treatment and in a low micro-molar range of exposure, as revealed by the decrease of the levels of the Notch activated domain and of the expression of several known Notch target genes in different human T-ALL cell models. Notably, we demonstrated that compound 8 does not interfere with the GS or ADAM activity, nor, at least in DND41 cells, with the early phases of receptor maturation process ending with the cell-surface localization of Notch receptor, thus encouraging future in-depth investigations to address its molecular mechanism of action.",
                "Previous studies demonstrated that deregulated Notch signaling activation is linked to the uncontrolled growth of T-ALL cells and, consistently Notch inhibition by long term GSI treatments results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of GSI-sensitive cell lines3, 42, 43.",
                "Here, we show that Notch inhibition, induced by short time exposure to chalcone\u2013derived molecule 8 at low micro molar concentrations, results in anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in several human T-ALL cells, which were reverted by N1ICD overexpression, thus demonstrating that Notch1 inhibition is responsible, at least in part, of the growth inhibitory effect.",
                "Notably, the data presented in our work suggest that compound 8 and the GSI DAPT are not pharmacologically equivalent and display significant differences in Notch inhibition.",
                "In DND41, KOPTK1 and TALL-1 cells, short term exposures to compound 8 arrested G1/S cell-cycle progression further supported by the reduction of Cyclin D3 and CDK4 levels, both known to be regulated by Notch signaling to promote transition through the cell cycle during T-ALL leukemogenesis41. Moreover, in keeping with Dohda and colleagues data, which demonstrated that deregulated Notch signaling in T-ALL promotes cell cycle progression by maintaining low levels of expression of the anti-proliferative p2755, we observed that 8-induced G1 cell cycle arrest in DND41, KOPTK1 and TALL-1 cells combined with increased expression levels of p27, further supporting the compound 8 anti-cancer activity leading to apoptosis of human T-ALL cells.",
                "In summary, our results propose the chalcone derivative 8 as a novel and potent Notch inhibitor endowed with a naturally occurring scaffold, and provide novel guidelines for future development of chalcone-based bioactive Notch blocking agents, useful in the treatment of T-ALL and other cancers characterized by activated Notch signaling as single agents, or in combination with standard anti-cancer drugs."
