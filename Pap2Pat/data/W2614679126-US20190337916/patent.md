# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present description relates to new Notch inhibitor compounds for use in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Notch signaling is an inter-cellular communication system that plays a key role in regulating biological processes of primary importance, such as self-maintenance and stem cell differentiation in embryonic development and in homeostasis in different tissues of the adult organism.

In mammals, the Notch family comprises four trans-membrane receptors (Notch1-4), highly conserved from an evolutionary point of view, and five ligands (Jagged-1, -2, Delta-like-1, -3 and -4).

Notch signaling activation occurs through the interaction of the extracellular domain of a Notch receptor, expressed on the membrane of a cell receiving the signal, with a ligand present on the membrane of a signaling cell. Interaction with the ligand predisposes the Notch receptor to two consecutive proteolytic cuts, by the enzymatic action of the TACE complex (ADAM metalloprotease TNF-α converting enzyme) before, and of the gamma-secretase complex after, which culminate with the release of the active Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which moves into the nucleus and promotes the expression of specific target genes.

The constitutive activation of the pathway, due to mutations, gene amplifications or post-translational changes to Notch receptors, is directly related to the development, progression, angiogenesis, and poor prognosis in a large number of oncologic pathologies, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

Therefore, one of the objectives of the research, aimed at developing innovative therapies for curing T-ALL, is the pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling.

In this context, to date, the most promising approach and the examination of several clinical trials involves blocking the proteolytic cut of the Notch receptor that leads to the release of the activated domain through treatment with small molecules of gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Unfortunately, as revealed by clinical studies, potential clinical applications of GSIs in anti-tumor therapies are limited by primary resistance and/or side effects associated with the treatments. In particular, it has been shown that exposure to GSIs often accompanies the onset of metaplasia of the goblet cells of the intestine.

A second strategy, alternative to the use of GSIs, involves the use of selectively directed monoclonal antibodies against Notch receptors and/or ligands, but this approach also has intrinsic limits. The efficacy of the action of ligand-competitive antibodies is closely related to the expression levels of the receptors and their ligands, and the different affinity of the four Notch receptors for the respective ligands. Furthermore, the therapeutic use of antibodies may be ineffective in T-ALL subgroups in which the signaling is constitutively activated due to chromosomal translocations or Notch gene mutations.

Given the high number of diseases and tumors associated with the deregulation of the Notch pathway, it is even more necessary to develop new, efficient, specific and safe therapies directed at the inhibition of this signaling in order to effectively counteract resistance, recurrence and metastatization phenomena in different solid and hematologic tumors including T-ALL.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Taking these considerations into account, there is a need for innovative therapeutic solutions that effectively treat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In accordance with the present invention, the aforesaid object is achieved thanks to the solution specifically referred to in the attached claims, which form an integral part of the present description.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

In the following description, there are numerous specific details to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. The embodiments may be implemented, in practice, without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other cases, well-known structures, materials or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects of the embodiments.

Throughout the present specification, the reference to “an embodiment” or “embodiment” means that a particular configuration, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Therefore, the appearance of expressions “in a certain embodiment” or “in an embodiment” in various points throughout this specification does not necessarily always refer to the same embodiment. Moreover, the particular details, structures or characteristics can be combined in any suitable way in one or more embodiments.

The headings used here are used merely for convenience, and do not interpret the object or meaning of the embodiments.

In recent years, scientific and industrial interest has been progressively increasing in relation to small naturally-occurring molecules, bio-pharmacologically active in various pathological contexts including neoplastic diseases. In this context, in addition to all the molecules proposed as gamma-secretase inhibitors, various naturally-occurring molecules have been proposed as potentially new anti-tumor agents capable of suppressing Notch signaling.

In the present study, a library of about one thousand naturally-occurring compounds, isolated from plants known for their use in traditional medicine, and their chemical derivatives, were grouped into clusters according to a chemo-informatics approach.

The clustering of the library according to this method allowed the obtainment of groups of chemically and pharmacologically similar molecules, for each of which a representative molecule (A-H) has been identified, illustrated in Table 1.

In order to detect small molecules able to modulate the Notch signal transduction pathway, the effects on the endogenous activation of Notch signaling and on cell proliferation in stabilized human lines of T-ALL were evaluated, known to be sensitive to the block of Notch signaling for each representative molecule of each of the eight clusters (A-H).

The cross-analysis of the results obtained from biochemical and functional assays indicated the molecule 3,4,2′, 4′-tetrahydroxychalcone (butein, C) as a new and potent inhibitor of Notch signaling able to significantly inhibit cell proliferation at low concentrations. In this regard, the inventors of the present application have verified that short exposure times to the molecule C significantly repress both the proliferation and the endogenous activation of the Notch1 receptor starting from a concentration between 5 μM and 10 μM, with a dose-dependent effect in human T-ALL cell lines.

In order to enhance the activity and selectivity of action of butein (C), the present inventors have designed a number of structural analogues of butein, which have been synthesized and tested in vitro.

Analysis of the results obtained from biochemical and functional assays has shown that these compounds exhibit a good inhibitory capacity of Notch signaling and proliferation compared to butein itself, so that these compounds present a pharmacological potential for treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

wherein

R1′ is hydrogen, halogen, ORA, C(═O)RA, C(═O)ORA, OC(═O)RA, SRA, SO2RA, SO3RA, OSO2RA, OSO3RA, N(RA)2, NHC(═O)RA, C(═O)N(RA)2, or C(RA)3;

In general, the data of the present invention propose butein and synthetic chalcones of formula (I), butein analogues, as inhibitors of Notch signaling, and emphasize the efficacy of compound 8 as a new potential antitumor agent that blocks Notch signaling. In this regard, short-term treatment with compound 8 represses cell proliferation, protein expression of activated domains of Notch1 and Notch3 receptors, and the gene expression of several known transcriptional targets of the Notch pathway at lower concentrations than the molecule C in different T-ALL cellular models.

In this regard, it should be noted that in

European patent application EP 2606884, small molecule inhibitory compounds of Notch are disclosed, although these compounds exhibit inhibitory activity comparable to that of compound 8, the latter has a significantly lower molecular weight. Given that the efficiency of a candidate drug is given by the relationship between the biological activity and the molecular weight (or the number of heavy atoms), compound 8 is considerably more efficient, being further validated by SAR studies. The patent application US-A-2015/0175548 discloses a molecule similar to nifedipine, with comparable anti-proliferative activity, albeit slightly less efficient, to that of compound 8. It should be noted that nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, with effects on cardiac activity, so that its use in therapy is doubtful given the potential relevance of the side effects it may cause, particularly on the heart.

In a recent study, the molecule Xanthohumol has been described as a Notch signaling inhibitor and apoptosis promoter in hepatocarcinoma cells with IC50, on average, between 10 and 15 μM (Kunnimalaiyaan et al., 2015). Compound 8, although structurally related to the molecules described by Kunnimalaiyaan and colleagues, was shown to be significantly more active. It should be noted that, in addition to that reported, in the screening carried out by the present inventors, the chalcones of formula (I) prenylated in ring A, although the prenylation position was different from that of the compound being disclosed, did not show any inhibitory activity of Notch (4-OH-Isocordoin).

### RESULTS

Butein: Naturally-Occurring Chalcone as an Inhibitor of the Notch Signal Transduction Pathway

To focus attention on a relatively small, manageable number of molecules of the library of natural products, only the molecules most representative of the eight most abundant clusters were considered for in vitro tests. For this purpose, a diversity-oriented random selection (DORS) approach was used of the compounds based on a clustering algorithm that is based on the substructure and molecular fingerprint similarity (Stahl and Mauser, 2005). Representative molecules of the eight clusters are shown in Table 1.

In order to identify new naturally-occurring molecular agents able to modulate Notch signaling, the effects on protein expression of the activated domain of Notch1 (N1VAL), and of the intracellular domain of Notch3 (N3ICD), were evaluated in DND41 cells through

Western blotting assays, following treatment for 36 hours with increasing concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 μM) of the eight molecules (A-H) previously selected. Functional biochemical screening was performed on T-ALL DND41 cells because they are notoriously sensitive to the block of Notch signaling, and characterized by the constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the Notch1 pathway and by the high expression of Notch3. This makes this cell line a useful experimental model for screening putative Notch inhibitors.

Among the eight molecules considered, molecule C revealed the highest inhibitory activity against Notch signaling, as shown by the decreased expression of N1VAL and N3ICD at concentrations ranging from 5 μM to 10 μM (FIG. 1). On the other hand, treatments with the molecules D, E, F and G did not significantly modulate the expression of N1VAL, while A, B and H reduce its expression at very high concentrations (between 20 μM and 50 μM) (FIG. 1).

In order to evaluate the biological implications of the compounds, their effect on cell proliferation/vitality was tested by determining the relative concentrations of growth inhibition (IG50) by means of the MTS cellular assay. Consistent with the high inhibitory activity of Notch, exposure to molecule C dramatically reduces cell proliferation in DND41 cells at concentrations comparable to those sufficient to inhibit Notch signaling (IG50 of 7.79±1.73 μM) (Table 1). Conversely, compounds B and H show a low anti-proliferative activity with IG50 values of 13.89±2.70 μM and 22.64±1.89 μM, respectively, while the molecules A, D, E, F and G do not significantly affect cell proliferation at doses of up to 50 μM. Overall, cross-analysis of the screening data described above indicates that among all the natural compounds considered, chalcone C (butein) is the most potent inhibitor of Notch signaling and cell proliferation in T-ALL cells.

Design and Synthesis of Butein Derivatives

Results from the biological tests have suggested the promising role of the chalcone scaffold in modulating the Notch signaling pathway. Given that molecule C emerged from the first screening as a promising hit, a second generation of chemical derivatives (Table 2) was designed and synthesized in order to increase the biological activity, to remove the catecholic group (Schweigert et al., 2001) that is very sensitive to oxidation reactions, and to outline the structure-activity relationships (SAR). The general synthetic strategy used to prepare chalcones is based on the Claisen-Schmidt condensation (FIG. 2) (Sogawa et al., 1994).

Compound 8 is a Potent Inhibitor of Notch and Proliferation in T-ALL Cells.

In order to investigate the activity and selectivity of action of the 12 synthetic derivatives of butein, and following the screening scheme described in the first design phase, the efficacy of these molecules was analyzed by verifying the effects of 36 hours of treatment at increasing doses on the activation of Notch signaling and on the proliferation in DND41 cells.

Treatments with compound 8 inhibit the expression of Notch1 and Notch3 activated domains at lower concentrations than butein (doses between 1 μM and 5 μM) (FIG. 3). Conversely, all the other 11 synthetic derivatives modulate the expression levels of the two receptor domains at higher concentrations (FIG. 3). In support of the high inhibitory activity of Notch, cell proliferation assays in response to increasing doses of the synthetic compounds demonstrated that compound 8 is the most potent repressor of proliferation. Treatments with compound 8 repress proliferation with IG50=1.92 μM±0.14 μM, while all the other chemical derivatives present anti-proliferative activities that are 10 to 20 times weaker, as demonstrated by IG50 values greater than 11 μM (Table 1). Given the high power of action at low micromolar concentrations of compound 8, subsequent functional and biological comparison analyses between compound 8 and the additional 14 compounds illustrated in Table 2 were carried out by adding two intermediate concentrations (0.5 μM and 2.5 μM) in dose-response assays (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50 μM). Among the 14 compounds of Table 2, only molecules 16 and 17 showed inhibitory activity of Notch signaling in a range of concentrations comparable to those disclosed for compound 8 (at doses of 2.5 μM) (FIG. 4). The subsequent comparative analysis of the effects of 36 hours of treatment with compounds 8, 16 and 17 on the protein expression of N1VAL and N3ICD finally confirmed compound 8 as the most potent Notch inhibitor (FIG. 5). In addition, compound 8 is the most effective antiproliferative agent compared to all the synthetic derivatives tested, including 16 and 17, which reveal IG50 values greater than 13 μM (Table 2).

Overall, the data obtained in the experiment described above propose compound 8 as the most promising Notch blocking agent among all the molecules tested, and in order to exclude possible specific cell line effects, analysis was also carried out on additional cell lines. As confirmation of its efficacy on the inhibition of Notch signaling, 36 hours of treatment with compound 8 reduced N1VAL expression levels in KOPTK1 cells and N3ICD in TALL-1 cells, in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 6A). The KOPTK1 cell line is characterized by constitutive Notch1 activation, due to gene mutations of Notch1, while the TALL-1 cell line, due to mutations of the Notch3 gene, has constitutively active signaling of the Notch3 receptor.

In line with the block of signaling, treatment with compound 8 in DND41, KOPTK1 and TALL-1 cells significantly reduces the expression of known Notch gene targets such as DELTEX1, HES1e and c-MYC (FIG. 6B). In addition, in the same lines, compound 8 drastically inhibits cell proliferation with IC50=0.91±0.06 μM in KOPTK1 cells and with IC50=0.29±0.02 μM in TALL-1 cells.

Conversely, exposure to compound 8 does not significantly influence the proliferation of immortalized non-tumor lines of HaCaT keratinocytes (IC50=48.61±8.06 μM), in which Notch acts as an oncosupressor. Confirming instead the Notch blocking activity, treatment with compound 8 in the same cells significantly reduces the expression of the activated domain of Notch1 starting from concentrations of 2.5 μM (FIG. 6A).

Structure-activity Relationships (SARs) of Chalcone Derivatives

Biological analyzes of the natural chalcone C and of the compounds of formula (I) highlight compound 8 as the most active Notch inhibitor in T-ALL. The SAR was processed and graphically represented (FIG. 7), based on three structural levels of the chalcone base skeleton: ring A, ring B and the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system.

Regarding ring A, methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 2′ improves the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, only when ring B is not replaced by hydroxyl groups at position 4. Under these conditions, the presence of the methoxyl group at position 4′ provides a greater activity with respect to the steric mole of the tetrahydropyranyl protecting group. Therefore, it is apparent from the structure of compound 8 that the hydroxylic substitutions act synergically at positions 2′ and 4 of the chalcone scaffold. Based on this evidence, the single replacement on ring A (14, 15 and 17) at different positions reduces biological activity with respect to the rings with double replacement at position 2′ and 4′ (8 and 16). In addition, single-replacement derivatives have shown a comparable inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, although methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 4′ dramatically reduces the expression levels of N1VAL and N3ICD with respect to compound 8, unlike that observed for chalcones with a single-replacement at position 2′ (14 and 15).

In particular, the activity of chalcone derivatives seems to be significantly dependent on the replacement of ring B. Indeed, comparing the chalcones having the same ring A, the hydroxyl group improves the biological activity, particularly when inserted at position 4, playing a key role in reducing both cell proliferation activity and Notch expression (8).

Finally, reducing the double bond of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system completely abolishes the biological efficacy, suggesting that the reduced molecular flexibility required to ensure the distance between the phenyl rings A and B is more suitable for inducing Notch inhibition.

Materials and Methods

Chemoinformatics A clustering algorithm similar to that previously developed by Stahl and Mauser (Stahl and Mauser, 2005) was generated and used, exploiting the modularity and versatility of the Python scripting language (OpenEye Python Toolkit [OpenEye Toolkits 2015. OpenEye Scientific Software, Santa Fe, N. Mex. http://www.eyesopen.com]). The algorithm was then used to cluster the molecules of the in-house library of naturally-available compounds. A threshold value of 0.6 for the Tanimoto comparison of the maccs166-type fingerprints, while a threshold value of 0.8 was used to compare the Raymond's score (Raymond et al., 2002) during the analysis and comparison of the substructures of the various molecules (Stahl and Mauser, 2005).

The residue was purified on a flash chromatography column using an eluent mixture of n-hexane: EtOAc=9:1 (v/v) to obtain the corresponding chalcone 1-4, 9-10, 12-13, 5a-8a, 11a, 14a-17a.

General Procedure for Deprotection of Chalcones

The protected chalcones 5a, 7a-8a, 11a, 14a-17a (0.25 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.03 mmol) were solubilized in MeOH (20 ml). The reaction was stirred, at room temperature, for about 24 hours and the solvent was removed under vacuum. Subsequently, distilled water was added, the mixture was neutralized with 5% NaHCO3 and extraction with EtOAc was carried out. The organic fraction was isolated, dehydration was carried out with Na2SO4 and the solvents were then removed under vacuum. The residue was purified on a flash chromatography column using an eluent mixture of n-hexane: EtOAc=9:1 (v/v) to obtain the corresponding chalcone 5, 7-8, 11, 14-18.

Catalytic Hydrogenation of 8

Inside the reaction tube, two empty/nitrogen cycles were performed, and then compound 8 (100 mg, 0.37 mmol) was placed with 10% Pd/C (98 mg) in EtOAc (10 mL) at room temperature, at 1 atm pressure of H2 for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through a membrane filter (Millipore, Millex-LH, 0.45 mm) and the filtrate was concentrated to obtain compound 8b with a quantitative yield.

Cell Lines and Treatments

The cell lines DND41 (ACC 525, DSMZ, Braunschweig, GERMANY), KOPTK1 (RRID: CVCL_4965) were maintained in culture in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum. TALL-1 cells (ACC-521: DSMZ, Braunschweig, GERMANY) were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, while HaCaT cells (ACC-771: DSMZ, Braunschweig, GERMANY) were maintained in Eagle's culture medium according to Dulbecco (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with the naturally-occurring compounds A-H or with compounds 1-17 for times and concentrations indicated in the text.

Proliferation Analysis and Calculation of IG50

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with a density of 5×105 cells/ml (5×104 cells per well) and treated for the times and the concentrations of the various compounds, as indicated in the text.

All treatments were carried out in triplicate, including control treatments. All treatment reactions contained a final concentration of 1% DMSO (D5879; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo., USA). To quantify vitality, cells were assayed by the MTS CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (G3580; Promega, Madison, Wis., USA). Absorbance was detected at 490 nm using the GloMax Multidetection System instrument (Promega, Madison, Wis., USA). Data were collected in the form of absorbance units (ABSs) and standardized to obtain the proliferation rate (MTS) through the equation:

% cell proliferation=(ABScell culture+compound−ABSculture medium+compound/(ABScell culture+DMSO−ABSculture medium+DMSO)×100.

The 50% inhibition concentration was calculated using the GraphPad Prism software program (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif., USA).

Protein Extraction, Immunoblotting, Antibodies

Laemmli Sample Buffer (161-0737; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA) was added to each cell pellet. Cells were lysed by ultrasonic sonication and to each mixture 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (161-0710; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA) was added. Samples were denatured at 100° C. for 5 min and protein mixtures were separated by means of Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis using 8% acrylamide and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After transfer, the membranes pre-saturated in 5% Blot Dry Fat Milk (1706404; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA) were incubated for 16 hours at +4° C. with the following primary antibodies diluted at 1:1000 in 5% Dry Fat Milk (1706404; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA): Notch1Val1744 (2421; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass., USA), Notch3 (2889; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass., USA) and β-actin (sc-47778; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif., USA).
