                        "Factorization is a process for decomposing data into meaningful components, or factors. One kind of data related to this invention are light fields, which describe the transport of light throughout a scene. A number of light field factorization methods are known, see U.S. Pat. No. 7,062,419 to Grzeszczuk, et al, issued Jun. 13, 2006, \u201cSurface light field decomposition using non-negative factorization,\u201d and U.S. Patent Application 20040249615, Grzeszczuk et al. published Dec. 9, 2004, \u201cSurface light field decomposition using non-negative factorization.\u201d Those methods use approximate graphical representations of objects, instead of images of real world scenes.",
                        "One factorization, method decomposes complex surface reflectance functions (spatially varying BRDFs) into a sum of products of lower dimensional (1D or 2D) components, Lawrence et al., \u201cInverse Shade Trees for Non-Parametric Material Representation and Editing,\u201d ACM. Trans. on Graphics (also Proc. of ACM SIGGRAPH) (July) 2006 incorporated herein by reference. A similar method decomposes a time-varying surface appearance into a low dimensional representation that is space-time dependent, Gu et al., \u201cTime-varying Surface Appearance: Acquisition, Modeling, and Rendering. ACM Trans, on Graphics, 2006. Both of those methods accomplish similar goals. They factorize large datasets of complex surface reflectance into terms that are compact, and at the same time, physically meaningful and editable. Because they acquire and model the full eight-dimensional BRDF, they can render under any viewing, lighting, and in the case of Gu et al, temporal condition. The primary goal of their work is to compute shade trees in computer graphic applications. However, the complexity of the BRDF acquisition makes those methods impractical for complex, outdoor scenes.",
                        "Inverse rendering measures attributes, such as lighting, textures, and the BRDF from images. Most prior art focuses on small objects and indoor scenes. One method recovers photometric properties from images of buildings, Debevec et al., \u201cEstimating Surface Reflectance Properties of a Complex Scene under Captured Natural Illumination, USC ICT Technical Report ICT-TR-06.2004, 2004. They are able to relight and generate photo-realistic images from arbitrary viewpoints. However, their methods require measurements of the incident illumination and surface materials and a 3D model of the scene geometry. That makes the method impractical for outdoor scenes.",
                        "Another method separates the light field in a scene into direct and global components using controlled lighting, Nayar et ah, \u201cFast Separation of Direct and Global Components of a Scene using High Frequency Illumination,\u201d ACM Trans. on Graphics, 2006. Obviously, it is impossible to control the lighting in outdoor scenes.",
                        "Therefore, it is desired to factor a sequence of images acquired of complex indoor or outdoor scenes into meaningful components that completely describe the scene.",
                        "Time-Lapse Photography",
                        "In time-lapse photography, a sequence of images (video) is acquired at a slow rate, and rendered at a high rate. Thus, time seems to lapse faster. Conventional time-lapse photography is often used for outdoor scenes, e.g., tidal flows, blooming flowers, and weather and traffic patterns. Time-lapse photography is also frequently used in surveillance applications.",
                        "Time-lapse photography can generate a large amount of data. For example, a single camera that takes an image every five seconds produces 17,280 images per day, or close to a million images per year. Image compression can reduce the storage requirements, but the reconstructed images typically suffer from annoying artifacts and are not very useful for further image analysis. In addition, it is difficult to edit the images in a time-lapse sequence, and advanced image-based rendering operations, such as relighting are impossible.",
                        "Therefore, a key challenge in dealing with time-lapse videos is to provide a representation that efficiently reduces storage requirements while allowing advanced image editing and useful image analysis.",
                        "One method uses intrinsic images to represent intrinsic characteristics of a scene, such as illumination, reflectance, and surface geometry, Barrow et al., \u201cRecovering intrinsic scene characteristics from images,\u201d Academic Press, 1978. Another method uses a maximum-likelihood framework to estimate a single reflectance image and multiple illumination images from time-lapse video, Weiss, \u201cDeriving Intrinsic Images from Image Sequences,\u201d IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), II: 68-75, 2001. That method was extended to derive time-varying reflectance and illumination images from a surveillance video, Matsushita et al., \u201cIllumination normalization with time-dependent intrinsic images for video surveillance,\u201d CVPR, IEEE Computer Society, 3-10, 2003.",
                        "Another method use time-lapse images to determine a reflectance field of a scene for a fixed viewpoint, Matusik et al, \u201cProgressively-Refined Reflectance Functions from Natural Illumination,\u201d Eurographics Symposium on Rendering, Keller et al., Eds., 299-308, 2004. They represent images as a product of the reflectance field and incident illumination. However, that method requires estimating the incident illumination using an additional light probe camera. The estimated reflectance field light combines the effects of reflectance and shadows. That method is only suitable for studio settings and not outdoor scenes.",

The normal clusters can be used for a variety of computer vision applications, including the decomposition of the image into the terms of a linearly separable bidirectional reflectance distribution function BRDF."

The factorization enables a user to relight a scene, recover a portion of the scene geometry, e.g., the surface normals, and to perform image editing applications.",
                        "In one embodiment of the invention, the images are acquired of outdoor scenes using time-lapse photography. The camera is fixed, and the scene is mostly stationary. The scene can be illuminated by sunlight or moonlight. In this case, the scene will include lighting patterns, including shadows, which slowly evolve over time as the earth rotates.",
                        "The method locates onsets of the shadows using a profile of intensities for each pixel in the images, which varies over time. The profiles are called appearance profiles. There is one time evolving appearance profile for each pixel.",

The volumes are analyzed using matrix factorization to obtain two sets of basis matrices representing variation of pixel intensities over time, together with per pixel offsets, and intensity scaling of the basis matrices that represent spatial variation. The resulting representation is compact, and compresses the entire sequence of images, be it for a day or a year or more, into three images, two sets of basis matrices, and a compressed representation for shadows.",

The shadows can be discarded or retained, depending on the application. Other outliers, such as moving pedestrians or vehicles can be handled explicitly or implicitly.",

                        "FIG. 1 shows the basic idea of one embodiment of our invention. A camera 110 acquires a sequence of images (frames) 101 of a scene 102. The scene 102 is primarily illuminated by a moving source 104 of direct light. The dotted lines represent viewing rays 103. In a preferred embodiment, the image sequence 101 is a time-lapse video of an outdoor scene 102A-102B. Note the reversal of the shadows in the scene over time t. However, it should be understood that the invention can also be worked with non-time-lapse videos, and indoor scenes that have some form of movable direct lighting.",
                        "Lighting Factors",
                        "In real world scenes, the various factors that contribute to the light observed by a camera are numerous and complex. There can be direct illumination, which, can include sunlight, moonlight, or one or more artificial sources of light. Indirect illumination includes all other light, such as skylight and direct light transported to the camera by other means. The effects of indirect illumination are mostly visible in shadows, e.g., the shadows cast by a building. Reflectance is the amount of incoming light that is reflected by a surface. Reflectance usually depends on the incoming light and the outgoing view directions. If the view direction is fixed, the reflectance only depends on the incoming light.",
                        "To simplify this description, we factor a light field observed by a camera into sunlight and skylight, and shadow components. Therefore, without loss of generality, we use the terms sunlight image, sunlight basis matrix, sunlight profiles, skylight image, skylight basis matrix, skylight profiles, shadow image and shadow profile to explain the factors. It should be understood that the same terms can be used for indoor scenes, where the light source or sources are natural and/or artificial, for example, the \u2018sunlight\u2019 is a moving spotlight, and \u2018skylight\u2019 is ambient lighting.",
                        "Appearance Profiles",
                        "For each unique (x,y) location of a pixel P in the sequence of images 101, an appearance profile 131 is constructed 130. The appearance profile represents a time evolving appearance of the scene at that pixel. For example, if the image has 1000\u00d71000 pixels, then there are a million appearance profiles. There is one intensity value for each image or frame in each profile. The appearance profiles are factored 140 to produce shadow 141, sunlight 148, and skylight components 143 representative of the time evolving appearance of the scene 102. The components 141-143 can be uses to reconstruct 150 a reconstructed image sequence 151 or novel video.",
                        "Shadow Component",
                        "The shadow component 141 includes a shadow profile for each pixel. Each shadow profile has a bit for each frame, i.e., instance in time. The bit is zero if the pixel is a shadow at that particular time, and one otherwise. Thus, the shadow profiles are a highly compressed binary representation of time evolving shadow patterns, primarily due to the moving 105 light source 104.",
                        "Sunlight Component",
                        "The sunlight component 142 includes a sunlight image 145 in a form of weights Wsun. Thus, a single image is used to represent the appearance of the scene 102 due to direct sunlight over the entire time span of the sequence 101. A sunlight basis matrix Hsun(t) is for spatial scaling, and an offset image \u03a6 171 provides temporal scaling, where Hsun is temporal curve, Wsun is spatial scaling and \u03a6 are temporal offsets.",
                        "Skylight Component",
                        "The skylight component 143 includes a single skylight image Wsky 146, and a skylight basis matrix Hsky(t) 149.",
                        "Details",
                        "As shown in FIG. 1B, the embodiments of our invention provide a method 100 for factoring the sequence of images 101, i.e., a video, acquired of the scene 102 overtime 106 into the shadow, sunlight, and skylight components 141-143. Our goal is to decompose the spatio-temporal-time volume of the time-lapse image sequence 101 images so as to enable us to analyze and edit the video, and generate a novel video, e.g., a scene without shadow as shown in FIG. 11B or a scene with different skylight as shown in FIG. 11C.",
                        "Therefore, we estimate 160 shadow, factor skylight 170, skylight 171. We subtract 175 the skylight 171 to obtain the sunlight 176, and factor 180 the sunlight 176.",

                        "where T is a light field transport matrix field, and L is a viewing ray 103, i.e., L is moving 105 light 104. Each pixel Fi(t) 120 in the frame F stores an intensity value along the viewing ray in some direction. The matrix T completely describes the transport of energy from light to viewing rays, including shadowing, absorption, reflection, translucence and scattering effects. Be factoring the transport matrix T into the shadow component 141 and the skylight component 146, we obtain",
                        "F(t)=(R(t)*S(t)L(t), \u2003\u2003(2)",
                        "where \u2018*\u2019 denotes an element-by-element multiplication, S represents a shadow image 144, and R is a skylight image. A pixel in the shadow image S has a value of zero to indicate the presence of shadows at that pixel and time instance, otherwise the pixel is one. That is the shadow image is a binary image, see FIGS. 4-5. The skylight image R(t) 149 varies with time 106 because the skylight image includes the effects of inter-reflections and light scattering in the scene 102 illuminated by the moving light source 104.",
                        "We can approximate the incident lighting in the scene as a sum of an ambient term Lsky(t) due mostly to atmospheric scattering, and a single-directional Lsun(t), corresponding to the sunlight (or moonlight) 104.",
                        "F(t)=(R(t)*Ssky)Lsky(t)+(R(t)*Ssun(t)Lsun(t). \u2003\u2003(3)",
                        "This approximation neglects sources of artificial lighting in the scene, such as streetlights and spotlights. Because the separation of sunlight and reflectance under diffuse lighting is ill-posed, we collapse the first term according to",

                        "Remarkably and in contrast with the prior art, we estimate Isky(t), Ssun(t), and R(t) from the sequence of frames F(t) 120 without knowledge of the geometry of the scene, material properties of surfaces in the scene, direction and intensity of the incident lighting, and camera calibration.",
                        "We estimate Isky(t) from pixels that are in shadow, whereas directly illuminated pixels include Isky(t)+ Isun(t).",

                        "We assume that the intensity of the pixels 120 is due to direct illumination and reflection from surfaces in the scene. Therefore, portions of the image that show the sky 210 are segmented out. Later we can composite the sky portion back into reconstructed images 151. This has the added benefit that we preserve moving clouds, which can be an important visual component in time-lapse videos.",
                        "As the sun 104 moves 105 due to rotation of the earth, the observations at the pixels A, B and C in the sequence 101 result in a continuous appearance profile, as shown in FIG. 3. In FIG. 3, the vertical axis indicates the pixel intensity (0-255) for the three pixels 201-203, the horizontal axis time (t) 106 or frame number, the jagged curves 301 the appearance profile 131, and the dotted curves the shadow profile 144. Note the \u2018intensity\u2019 for the shadow profile, as shown, is either zero or 1 to indicate in and out of a shadow.",
                        "The appearance profile 131 is a vector of intensities Fi(t) 131 measured at pixel Pi over time 106. It is a complicated function of the illumination, scene geometry, and surface reflectance. The pixel intensities change dramatically when illuminated directly or when the pixels 201-203 are in a shadow. We use drastic variation (discontinuities indicated by arrows) in the appearance profiles 133 to estimate the shadow profiles 147.",
                        "First, we determine a median value mmin of the n smallest intensities at each pixel location. We typically assume that each pixel is in a shadow some fraction of time, e.g., \u2155, so n is 20% of the total number of frames in the sequence. If Fi(t) greater than a threshold kmmin, then we set the shadow profile Si(t) 147 to \u2018one\u2019 for each frame and to \u2018zero\u2019 otherwise. We find heuristically that k=1.5 works well for most image sequences. Other thresholding techniques can also be used.",
                        "FIG. 4 shows a shadow image for frame 275. We call this a binary shadow image, because pixel values are either 0 or 1. It is generally quite noisy due to moving objects e.g., trees, vehicles, or people, and changes in the illumination, e.g., due to clouds. Therefore, to determine the final shadow image Ssun 144, we use an edge-preserving bi-lateral filter to produce the final shadow image as shown in FIG. 5. The insets 401 and 501 indicate close ups. We could improve the shadow images by explicitly removing moving objects, either by determining median images for short time intervals in the input sequence, or by using background models and a conventional object segmentation procedure.",

                        "One idea of our invention is that for an outdoor sequence of images 102 under a mostly clear-sky conditions, the appearance profiles 131 of all pixels in the scene are similar up to an offset along the time axis 106 and a scale factor along the intensity axis. This is an extension of orientation-consistency as described by Hertzmann et al., \u201cExample-Based Photometric Stereo: Shape Reconstruction with General, Varying BRDFs,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) 27,8 (August), 1254-1264 2005, incorporated herein by reference.",
                        "The basic idea is that similarly textured and similarly oriented surfaces reflect light in a similar manner. Hertzmann et al, determine the surface normals of an object that has been imaged together with, a reference objects with a similar shape and similar texture, e.g., spherical and similar BRDF. They use a metric that matches intensity extrema and unsupervised clustering to determine orientation consistencies between scene points of unknown normals and BRDFs. Their method is described for simple objects with similar textures in simple scenes in a studio setting with controlled artificial lighting.",
                        "Surprisingly, we estimate surface normals for complex outdoor scenes with unknown shapes, orientations and textures. Our idea is that the moving light source 104 provides different lighting over time. This means that, under the right conditions, two pixels with the same surface orientation have a similar appearance in the images 101. Scene points with different surface normals often exhibit extrema (highlights or specularities) in their appearance profiles at different time instances, irrespective of their material properties, see Koppal et al. above.",
                        "Therefore, in contrast with the conventional orientation-consistency method, our method factors the contributions of shadows, skylight, and sunlight. We represent the corresponding appearance profiles 131 as a linear combination of basis matrices that are offset and scaled. Unlike the prior art, we are not able to fit a simple analytic model, such as the Phong illumination model, to our complex scene. Therefore, we use a data-driven process.",
                        "This process determines the basis profile 1000. There is one basis profile 148 for sunlight, and another basis function 149 for skylight. All the data over time, i.e., the appearance profiles 131, at each pixel 120 can be \u2018explained\u2019 by time offsetting the basis profile 100 and scaling the profile by some weight wij. The weights are stored in the sunlight image 145. An offset image \u03a6 171, with an offset for each pixel approximates the surface normal of the corresponding scene point. That is, the offset image 171 represents the geometry of the scene 102. We can also have a skylight offset image. However, for outdoor scenes, the skylight is low intensity and noisy, see FIG. 6. A skylight offset image may be appropriate for controlled indoor scenes.",

The skylight matrix can be offset for indoor scenes.",

                        "Our factorization is based on art alternating constrained least squares (ACLS) procedure to decompose the appearance profiles 131 into the W and H factors, see Lawrence et al. above. There, ACLS is applied to the problem of decomposing measured data into intuitively editable components. We adapt the ACLS procedure to our method for decomposing the appearance profiles 131. ACLS can also incorporate a confidence matrix C to deal with missing data. Setting an entry of the matrix C to zero causes the corresponding measurement to have no effect on the factorization. We use the matrix C to decompose the skylight and illumination components.",
                        "We apply ACLS in two separate steps to factor a matrix storing the measured spatio-temporal appearance profiles F(t) 131. First, we factor Isky(t)\u2248WskyHsky(t). Then, we solve for the corresponding terms corresponding to the illumination profile Isun(t). More formally, each application of ACLS decomposes an m\u00d7n data matrix F(t) into a product of the n\u00d7k weight matrix W and a k\u00d7m is the basis matrix H(t), where m is the number of pixels in the image and n is the number of frames in the sequence 101. All decompositions are performed separately and identically on the three color channels of the data.",
                        "In order to adapt the conventional ACLS to handle the offsets necessary to implement Equation (5), we modify the iterative update stage of the procedure. Specifically, the conventional procedure according to Lawrence et al., alternates between phases in which H(t) is held fixed, while the matrix W is optimized using least squares, then vice versa. This is an instance of the principle of expectation maximization in inference.",
                        "In order to incorporate the offsets \u03a6i, we shift the entire matrix H(t) by +\u03a6i when updating the matrix Wi and, similarly, shift each row i of the matrix F(t) by \u2212\u03a6i during updates of the matrix H(t). Finally, we also use a third update phase during the iteration, in which we update the offsets \u03a6i by determining, for each pixel, the offset that minimizes the Euclidean error between the linear combination of the basis matrices H(t) with \u03a6(t).",

                        "In order to consider only shadowed pixels, we store (1\u2212Si(t)) row-wise in the confidence matrix C. This is a different strategy from using interpolation to fill in data for pixels under direct illumination, as we would need for factorization methods that do not consider confidence. However, because we have many frames in the sequence, the system of equations is highly over-constrained for a small number of basis profiles. Intuitively, if we are missing data at one pixel, then we probably observe the data at another pixel with a similar normal (offset) and appearance profile.",

FIG. 11B shows skylight image Wsky, i.e., no sunlight FIG. 11C shows a reconstructed sunlight image Isky(t), i.e., no skylight. The lighting is related to both surface albedo and ambient occlusion, where the ambient term for a pixel on a surface is determined by how occluded that pixel is by other surfaces in the scene, i.e., the darker the pixel, the less skylight the pixel receives or reflects.",

In some cases, we can filter the shadow images S(t) in the temporal domain to remove flickering of spurious shadows. As described above, we can remove these motion artifacts with a suitable computer vision background model. This effectively removes the \u201cghost\u201d shadows of moving objects.",

The binary shadow profiles are stored per pixel using interval encoding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression. The basis matrices can be stored in conventional files. The compression efficiency, depending on a complexity of the scale can range from three or more orders of magnitude.",

                        "As an advantage, our method factors the scene 102 into physically meaningful components 141-143. Each component can be edited to generate interesting effects. We can edit the offset image 171 to affect the appearance of surfaces by changing their pseudo-normals, see FIG. 11D. Edits to the sunlight image and sunlight profile have an effect on surface reflectance. We can also selectively remove shadows, for example, for buildings in the background. Note that by simply editing only the three sunlight, skylight and offset images, we can affect the entire reconstructed image sequence 151.",
                        "We can also generate non-photorealistic (NPR) effects, and stylized images and videos. First, we transform the offset image \u03a6 to pseudo-normals by mapping offsets to angles along the arc 105 that corresponding to the movement of the direct light source 104. In order to increase the plausibility of the normals, we apply a small offset to the normals based on a ratio between the sunlight and skylight images, reasoning that vertical surfaces generally receive less direct illumination than do horizontal surfaces. While these normals are certainly not accurate, we nevertheless expect that they are related to the true normals by some continuous function. The normals are sufficient as input to rendering techniques such as exaggerated shading, which seek to emphasize local differences between normals. We generate our final NPR results by compositing the exaggerated shading with the sun and sky color maps, as well as optionally the shadow images. Note that the process is temporally coherent over time, leading to smooth video results."

        "9. The method of claim 1, in which each shadow profile has one bit for each image in the sequence to indicate whether the pixel is in a shadow or not at the instances in time.",
        "10. The method of claim 2, in which the shadow profiles form a sequence of binary shadow images.",
        "11. The method of claim 10, further comprising:\napplying an edge-preserving bi-lateral filter to sequence of shadow images.",
        "12. The method of claim 10, further comprising:\nremoving moving objects from the sequence of shadow images.",
        "13. The method of claim 2, in which each pixel in the offset image approximate a surface normal in the scene.",
        "14. The method of claim 13, in which the surface normals represent geometry of the scene.",
        "15. The method of claim 2, in which the factorizing uses an alternating constrained least squares procedure to decompose the appearance profiles into the sets of matrices."
