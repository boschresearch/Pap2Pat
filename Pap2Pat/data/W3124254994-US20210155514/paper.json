    "title": "A Robust Flow-Through Platform for Organic Contaminant Removal",
    "date": "2021-01-01",
    "abstract": "Achieving the greatest cleanup efficiency with minimal footprint remains a paramount goal of the water treatment industry. Toxic organic compounds threaten drinking water safety and require effective pretreatment. Hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton process (Fe2+/H2O2) destroy organic contaminants based on their strong oxidation potential. An upgraded reaction using solid catalysts, referred to as the Fenton-like process, was recently adopted to avoid the ferric sludge generation during the conventional Fenton process. However, most heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts operate optimally at pH 3\u20135 and quite weakly in near-neutral water bodies. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of an electrolytically localized acid compartment (referred to as the Ella process) produced by electrochemical water splitting under flow-through conditions to facilitate the Fenton-like process. The Ella process boosts the activity of an immobilized iron oxychloride catalyst >10-fold, decomposing organic pollutants at a high flow rate. The robust performance in complex water bodies further highlights the promise of this platform.",

                "Various toxic organic compounds in the environment pose considerable threats to human health and the ecosystem. While efficient in providing clean drinking water, many advanced water treatment facilities have high capital and running costs that remain the principal barriers to implementation in developing countries.1 The classic Fenton process, which transforms hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022) under the ferrous ions (Fe2+) catalysis, is an affordable and proven water treatment technique.2 HO\u2022 is the second most oxidative species in nature after fluorine, with a redox potential of 2.73 V versus normal hydrogen electrode2, and could non-selectively destroy recalcitrant organic contaminants in water.3,4 By coupling with other water treatment units, such as coagulation, membrane filtration, or microbial degradation, the Fenton process can be adapted for various treatments of bodies of water.5\u20137 Fruitful progress has been achieved to date in Fenton chemistry for water treatment.8\u201312 In particular, in situ synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 under noble metal catalysis13 and H+ and O2 under photochemical14 or electrochemical catalysis11 are sustainable routes to reduce the chemicals cost. However, the formation of ferric sludge continues to be a challenge limiting implementation of the Fenton process. The sludge is formed when water pH is improved to approximately neutral after oxidation, and its toxicity stems from the adsorbed residual compounds in treated water.15 Treatment of the ferric sludge requires substantial chemical and manpower costs\u201410% to 50% of the overall operating costs in a water treatment plant.16,17",
                "Heterogeneous solid catalysts could overcome the drawback of ferric sludge formation. Both naturally occurring clays/minerals and transition metal-centered designer composites have been extensively explored as Fenton-like catalysts.8,18\u201321 These catalysts have noteworthy structural elegance in the unique coordination environment of their metal cores, which stabilizes the metal-H2O2 complex transition state and facilitates the electron transfer inter se.22 Furthermore, the turnover of metal atoms on the catalyst surface occurs via a peroxidase-mimicking mechanism (see Figure S1 for peroxidase structure),23 akin to the Haber-Weiss reaction of homogeneous Fenton chemistry.24 The pH dependence of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts is generally less strict than that of free iron ions, the latter of which is the most effective at pH 2.8\u20133.5.19 Nevertheless, most canonical Fenton-like catalysts favor acidic pH 3\u20135 (Table S1), and the catalyst turnover frequency (TOF) can be reduced by up to 100-fold under neutral conditions.25,26 This is due to surface metal-OH complexes forming at higher pH values and repelling H2O2 away from the exposed active sites. However, pH regulation of near-neutral drinking water bodies is challenging, especially if the water contains high carbonate alkalinity; furthermore, the acidification of contaminated groundwater for in situ water treatment could release undesired metal ions from aquifers.27,28 These concerns severely compromise the potential use of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts in the water treatment industry.",
                "Flow electrochemistry holds great promise for automatic pH regulation to support water treatment, wherein OH\u2212 and H+ generated from the cathode and anode, respectively, are redistributed based on ion migration, dispersion, and hydraulic flux.29 Here, we propose an electrolytically localized acidic-compartment (Ella) process to regulate solution pH for heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions, building on our extensive experiences in flow electrochemistry. The Ella process has a small footprint because it turns pH-neutral influent into acidic solution in between the electrodes, and zones beyond that are back to neutral as the influent. Combined with heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts, the Ella process demonstrated excellent performance under long-term use, high flow rate, and complex water chemistry, manifesting the robustness of this coupled platform for recalcitrant organic compounds removal."

                        "The Ella process was used to regulate the pH of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts for water treatment with desired acidity. To this end, immobilized catalysts must be transferred to the acidic zone, whereby H2O2 is rapidly transformed into oxidizing HO\u2022 radicals, leading to the instant degradation of organic compounds in the local vicinity (Figure 1A). This coupled water treatment process is categorized as an electro-Fenton-like (EFL) platform in this study. The flow-through treatment method is especially favored over the batch reaction mode for industry applications, since a water treatment plant treats high volumes of contaminated water at a fast pace. It is worth of noting that the EFL platform can take advantage of the intermittent solar and wind electricity, often with near-zero or even negative prices.",
                        "The contaminants treatment efficiency by the EFL platform is in the main determined by the reaction during the transport through the catalyst column\u2014that is, longer retention times and higher catalyst and H2O2 concentrations tend to result in more complete contaminant removal. Therefore, the key aspects to warrant the success of the EFL platform are to promote HO\u2022 generation and allow sufficient reaction time within the column."

                        "As a proof of concept, a benchtop flow-through device was manufactured for our EFL platform. A set of stable mixed metal oxide electrodes were installed 9 cm apart in a vertically anchored acrylic flow-through column device (15 cm \u00d7 5 cm outer diameter [OD]). The column was filled with clean silica sand (0.15\u20130.6 mm) to maintain a laminar flow. The combination of a 100-mA electric current and a 15-mL/min hydraulic flow rate was applied to the pH-neutral solution passing through the column, and solution pHs at various locations along the column were measured (Figure 1B). The solution was homogeneously neutral without electric current; however, by turning on the 100-mA electric current, an acidic pH of 2.93\u20133.12 between the anode and cathode was automatically attained at steady state. The electrochemically created acidity is suitable for most Fenton-like catalysts. The effluent pH measured as 7.59 was close to the influent value (pH 7), showing minimal effect on the treated water pH. A reactive transport model (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) that accounts for advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, and ion migration was used to simulate the pH profile.30 Modeling results indicate that the theoretical acidity of the confined space between electrodes using the above stated experimental settings is pH 2.8. The slight discrepancy in pH between experimental results and modeled value is possibly due to the fact that the current efficiency of water electrolysis was not 100%."

                        "Iron oxychloride (FeOCl) was reported to possess extraordinary Fenton-like catalytic activity with high fidelity and can be mass produced.22,31 Characterizations of the synthetic FeOCl nanocatalyst produced via the calcination of FeCl3\u20226H2O were shown in Figures S2 and S3. Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the primary pollutant to illustrate FeOCl catalytic degradation performance, as BPA is an environmental estrogen that disrupts the human endocrine system upon exposure.32 A total of 10 \u03bcM BPA was rapidly degraded by the FeOCl/H2O2 reaction. However, the addition of ethanol, a strong HO\u2022 radical quencher,33 competed with BPA for the produced HO\u2022 radical reservoir and fully inhibited BPA removal by the FeOCl/H2O2 reaction (Figure S4), demonstrating that the degradation of BPA was via HO\u2022 radical (Note S1). It was further found that FeOCl showed optimal activity at pH 3, ~9.3-fold higher than that at pH 7 in terms of HO\u2022 radical yield.",
                        "Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was harnessed to study the catalysis mechanism of the FeOCl/H2O2 reaction. It was revealed that the reaction is accomplished via two electron-transfer processes (Figure S5). In the first step, FeIIIOCl is reduced by H2O2 into FeIIOCl. In the second step, the derived FeIIOCl decomposes H2O2 into HO\u2022 radical via homolytic cleavage. The readily reducible nature of unsaturated Fe atoms on the exposed (100) surface of FeOCl crystals allows rapid turnovers of FeIII/II to catalyze the H2O2 transformation. Specifically, the energy barrier of reducing FeIII to FeII on FeOCl crystals by H2O2 was determined as 0.235 eV (Figure S6), whereas that of hematite (Fe2O3, a rhombohedral Fenton-like catalyst) is 0.76 eV as a comparison.34",
                        "It is, however, of great concern that the microcatalyst particles are subject to fluid transport, resulting in potential draining from the silica sand pores within the column device. For instance, by packing well-mixed FeOCl and silica sand particles into the column (Figure S7; Note S2), the overall catalyst activity decayed by 36% after 8 h due to hydraulic erosion (Figure S8). Another immobilization strategy of cross-linking FeOCl with alginate hydrogel was attempted for the effective retention of FeOCl nanoparticles (Figure S9; Note S3).35 However, the resulting FeOCl/alginate composite showed only 1% activity compared to the same amount of unimmobilized FeOCl catalyst (Figure S10; Note S4), delivering poor in-reactor performance under high flow rates (Figures S11 and S12; Note S5). This is due to a large fraction of FeOCl particles becoming buried inside the hydrogel of the FeOCl/alginate composite and not being effectively accessible by H2O2 molecules.",
                        "To solve this problem, FeOCl nanoparticles were alternatively immobilized on a porous \u03b3-Al2O3 support via a melt infiltration method36 (Figure 2A), with the belief that this approach offers maximum FeOCl catalytic sites for H2O2 molecules. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images clearly revealed the dispersion of FeOCl nanosheets on the amorphous \u03b3-Al2O3 support in the synthesized FeOCl/Al2O3 composite (Figures 2B\u20132D), with a surface area of 206 m2/g (Table S2). The compositional distribution of the FeOCl/Al2O3 was investigated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Figure 2E). EDX analysis identified Al, O, Fe, and Cl elements on the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. Elemental mapping results suggested that Al and Fe elements were separately located, in agreement with the overlay structure of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. Cl element exhibited a consistent pattern with Fe element on the FeOCl surface, while O element was uniformly distributed on the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite disclosed several characteristic diffraction peaks (2\u03b8) at 11.2\u00b0, 26.1\u00b0, and 35.4\u00b0, which respectively belongs to the (010), (110), and (021) planes of the orthorhombic FeOCl crystal (Powder Diffraction File [PDF]: 01\u2013072-0619) (Figure 2F). The chemical states of compositional elements were studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).37 In particular, deconvoluted Fe 2p spectrum showed that Fe3+ 2p1/2 (724.6 eV) and 2p3/2 (711.2 eV) were dominant over Fe2+ 2p1/2 (728.2 eV) and 2p3/2 (714.6 eV) (Figure 2G), which is consistent with the unimmobilized FeOCl crystal (Figure S3). XPS analyses of other elements in the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite and the \u03b3-Al2O3 support are shown in Figures S13 and S14. Overall, the results above suggested that the morphology and electronic properties of the FeOCl crystal remained intact after immobilization on the \u03b3-Al2O3 support.",
                        "Activity test results of the synthetic FeOCl/Al2O3 composite are shown in Figure 3. It was found that 10 \u03bcM BPA was completely degraded in 10 min by 0.2 g/L FeOCl/Al2O3 and 10 mM H2O2 at pH 3, while the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite or H2O2 alone led to negligible BPA removals. Furthermore, under the stated conditions, FeOCl/Al2O3-mediated Fenton-like reaction produced the most remarkable amount of HO\u2022 radicals at pH 3 (i.e., 289.8 \u03bcM after reaction for 30 min), the acidity of which could be readily achieved by the Ella process. The catalytic performance of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite showed a pattern consistent with that of the unimmobilized FeOCl nanoparticle (Figure S4), indicating that the \u03b3-Al2O3 support played no role in H2O2 transformation."

                        "The synthetic FeOCl/Al2O3 composites were transferred to the space between electrodes of the column to use the acidity produced by the Ella process (Figure 4A). Neutral solutions containing 10 mM H2O2 oxidant and 10 \u03bcM BPA contaminant were pumped through the column at a rate of 15 mL/min, and BPA removals along the hydraulic flux direction were measured (Figure 4B). Low BPA removal from the effluent (17.6%) was observed without electric current, due to the weak activity of FeOCl/Al2O3 under neutral condition. However, after a 100-mA electric current was applied to the electrodes, the gradual degradation of BPA took place as measured from the sampling ports, and BPA removal reached 100% in the effluent. Direct BPA degradation by electrodes was ruled out based on the control experiment without the FeOCl/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure S15). In addition, the presence of 10 mM ethanol as the HO\u2022 radical scavenger almost fully quenched BPA removal (Figure S15), suggesting that in situ-produced HO\u2022 radicals accounted for BPA degradation. As shown in Figure S16, the HO\u2022 radicals generated by the EFL platform could also non-selectively degrade other organic contaminants, including drugs (ibuprofen and carbamazepine), herbicide (atrazine), pesticide and drug precursors (4-chlorophenol and 4-nitrophenol), and recalcitrant dyes (rhodamine B, reactive blue 19, and orange II). The operating process to treat a dye solution may be viewed in more detail in Video S1. It was further determined that the yield of HO\u2022 radical produced by the platform when the 100-mA electric current was turned off and on was 23.5 and 254.4 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 4C). This 10.8-fold increase in HO\u2022 radical production was attributed to the acidic environment created by the Ella process, which boosted the FeOCl/Al2O3 catalyst activity. The results indicate that the EFL platform, by coupling a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst and the Ella process in a flow-through column device, is effective for the removal of organic contaminants.",
                        "The long-term stability of BPA removal by the EFL platform was tested (Figure 4D). Over the course of 8-h reactions, laminar fluid transport was maintained, and the BPA removal steadily approached 100%. Clearly, a duration of 8 h is not enough for practical industry application, but here is used as a proof of concept to demonstrate the durability of our system at the current stage. Future studies will include longer tests of up to weeks. BPA removal by this platform under different hydraulic flow rates was also measured (Figure 4E). A high flow rate leads to shortened contact time among H2O2 molecules, the catalyst surface, and the organic contaminant, which reduces HO\u2022 radical yield and compromises contaminant removal. Over 95% of 10 \u03bcM BPA could be removed from the effluent at a flow rate of <20 mL/min, whereas the BPA removal rate decreased to 82.4% and 44.4% at 25 and 30 mL/min, respectively. The tolerance of flow rate by using FeOCl/Al2O3 in this design was greatly superior to that using FeOCl crosslinked on alginate hydrogel as a catalyst (Figure S12), primarily due to the abundant catalytic sites exposed on the surface of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite.",
                        "The responsiveness of BPA removal by the EFL platform to the electric current was monitored by repeatedly turning the electric power supply on and off, with a 60-min interval. As shown in Figure 4F, BPA removal significantly increased after the 100-mA electric current was turned on for 15 min, and approached 100% after 40 min. As the power was turned off, BPA removal gradually decreased during the first 30 min, from 84.3%\u201392.3% to 16.7%\u201323.9%, and was steady afterward. The non-instant response of BPA removal to electricity was presumably because of the slow accumulation and the desorption of protons. The results demonstrated that electricity is a critical governor of contaminant removal by our developed platform. In addition, the observed response time in this study matches well with the intermittency of solar or wind-generated renewable electricity, and therefore our device can provide clean drinking water without the need for battery energy storage."

For instance, water bodies receiving leachates from industries could be highly basic and require a pH neutralization process such as CO2 sequestration before biological/chemical treatment.38 In this study, contaminants in a synthetic basic solution are treated by the EFL platform. Influent solutions of pH 7\u201311 were effectively acidified to ~pH 3 under 100 mA electric current and a 15-mL/min flow rate, in good agreement with modeling results (Figure 5A). Consequently, BPA removals approached 100% under the Ella process-mediated acidic environment, regardless of influent pH, whereas <22.4% of BPA was removed when the electric current was turned off (Figure 5B).",
                        "The potential of water bodies to neutralize protons, namely water alkalinity, represents another challenge for acid-demanding chemical treatments due to the buffering carbonate ions, expressed as equivalent milligrams of CaCO3/L.39 Specifically, a substantial amount of acid is required to overcome high water alkalinity for the conventional Fenton process. BPA removal in synthetic solutions containing 0\u2013200 mg CaCO3/L water alkalinity was tested by the EFL platform. The results show that the solution of higher alkalinity was less prone to acidification by the Ella process, but the acidic zone was still below pH 4.14 in all of the tests under the 100-mA electric current and the 15-mL/min flow rate (Figure 5C). This acidity led to an 84.5%\u2013100% removal efficiency of BPA, which is significantly higher than that when the electric current was turned off (Figure 5D). The acidity produced by the Ella process could be tuned against the water buffering capacity by adjusting the applied electric current and hydraulic flow rate. For instance, a combination of 60 mA electric current and 2 mL/min flow rate is able to acidify a solution of 500 mg CaCO3/L alkalinity from pH 8 to pH 3.5.40"

This means it takes <$0.0005 to synthesize 1 g FeOCl/Al2O3 catalyst, and we used ~50 g of synthesized catalyst particles for our device. By considering the long-term stability of this catalyst, its cost is indeed negligible. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical synthesis of highly concentrated H2O245,46 could be used as a replacement for externally supplied H2O2 in the future, eliminating the chemical cost.",

The cost of sludge disposal post-water treatment is ~$40\u2013$100/ton.16,52 However, the total cost is unclear since different amounts of iron are used for different bodies of water. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the cost for treating sludge is 10%\u201350% of the total cost, and sometimes can be up to 60%.17 Therefore, we believe the overall cost of our system is lower than conventional Fenton reactions. Our design avoids the iron sludge generation, which not only reduces the cost but also is more environmentally friendly. In general, however, the techno-economic analysis here is quite preliminary and will require more in-depth work in the future.",
                        "Moreover, we would like to mention future directions of scaling up the device. First, the catalyst should be cheap and easy to produce. One can certainly replace FeOCl with other Fenton catalysts, such as the nano MnO2 catalyst,53,54 since our system is not solely dependent on the FeOCl. Second, to ensure sufficient contact time between H2O2 and catalyst, the two electrodes should be distant enough. An outcome of this design strategy is the high voltage applied onto the two electrodes to drive the migration of proton and other ions. This will eventually increase the cost in electricity, and hence there exists a \u201csweet spot\u201d where electricity cost and catalysis performance reach a trade-off balance. Finally, the immobilization of the FeOCl catalyst should be adapted for industrial-scale operation. For example, it has been widely reported that catalyst nanoparticles could be ground into large particles via ball milling.55\u201357 This scalable method leads to very stable catalyst immobilization.",

The fast response of the EFL platform in removing organic pollutants especially allows for smart controls at low cost. In addition, it possesses the easy-to-(un)install feature that makes it affordable and compatible with other connecting units of a centralized water treatment facility. For instance, a feasible niche of this device is to function as an electrochemical filter before advanced purification units requiring the removal of fouling hazards such as organic molecules and biofilm-forming bacteria.47,48 On the small size end, our EFL platform can be redesigned to provide clean drinking water for individual families without using the electrical grid, by coupling with cheap photovoltaic sources.",

The acidic pH produced by the Ella process (100 mA electric current and 15 mL/min flow rate) mediated a 10.8-fold increase in HO\u2022 yield, which contributes to the complete removal of contaminants in the effluent. The EFL platform shows strong stability for long-term use, tolerance of high water flux, and effectiveness against complex water chemistry for organic contaminant removal. The proposed setup configuration is advantageous in that it provides a high degree of automation that enables water treatment by controlling the electric power, and also in the low operating cost that most modern water treatment plants strive for, both of which are especially attractive for industrial applications."
