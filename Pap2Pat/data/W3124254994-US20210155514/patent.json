                        "Various toxic organic compounds in the environment have produced considerable threats to human health and ecosystem. While efficient in providing clean drinking water with improved quality, many advanced water treatment facilities are flawed by high capital costs and remain as the principal barrier for implementation in developing countries (Lu et al. 2018). The classic Fenton process, which transforms hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (HO.) under the ferrous ions (Fe2+) catalysis, is an affordable and proven water treatment technique (Wardman et al. 2018). HO. is the second most oxidative species with a redox potential of 2.73 V (vs NHE) after fluorine in nature (Wardman et al. 2018), and could non-selectively destroy recalcitrant and toxic organic contaminants in water (Babuponnusami et al. 2014; Pignatello et al. 2006). By coupling with other water treatment units, such as coagulation, membrane filtration, or microbial degradation, the Fenton process can be adapted for various water bodies' treatments (Feng et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2011; Ganiyu et al. 2015). Fruitful progresses have been achieved to date in Fenton chemistry for water treatment (Herney-Ramirez et al. 2010; Pouran et al. 2015; Bokare et al. 2014; Brillas et al. 2009; Ganiyu et al. 2018). In particular, in situ synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 under noble metal catalysis (Yi et al. 2016), and H+ and O2 under photochemical (Moon et al. 2017), or electrochemical catalysis (Bolobajev et al. 2014) is a sustainable route to reduce the chemical cost. However, formation of the ferric sludge continues to be a challenge limiting implementation of the Fenton process. The sludge is formed when water pH is improved to around neutral after oxidation, and its toxicity stems from the adsorbed residual compounds in treated water (Bolobajev et al. 2014). Treatment of the ferric sludge requires substantial chemical and manpower costs\u201410% to 50% of overall operating costs in a water treatment plant (Pilego et al. 2012; Neyens et al. 2003).",
                        "Heterogeneous solid catalysts could potentially overcome the drawback of ferric sludge formation. Naturally occurring clays/minerals as well as transition metal-centered designer composites have been extensively explored as Fenton-like catalyst (Herney-Ramirez et al. 2012; Garrido-Ramirez et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2018; Munos et al. 2015; Pouran et al. 2014). These catalysts have noteworthy structural elegance in the unique coordination environment of their metal cores, which stabilizes the metal-H2O2 complex transition state and facilitates the electron transfer inter se (Sun et al. 2018). Furthermore, the turnover of metal atoms on the catalyst surface occurs via a peroxidase-mimicking mechanism (Gao et al. 2007), akin to the Haber-Weiss reaction of homogeneous Fenton chemistry (Koppenol et al. 2001). The pH-dependence of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts is generally less strict than that of iron ions, the latter of which is most effective in pH 2.8-3.5 (Cheng et al. 2018). Nevertheless, most canonical Fenton-like catalysts favor acidic pH 3-5 (Table 1), and catalysts turnover frequency (TOF) can be reduced by up to 100 folds under neutral condition (Liu et al. 2011; Andr\u00e9 et al. 2011). This is due to surface metal\u2014OH complexes forming at higher pH values and repelling H2O2 away from the exposed active sites. However, pH regulation of near-neutral drinking water bodies is challenging, especially if the water contains high carbonate alkalinity; furthermore, acidification of contaminated groundwater for in situ water treatment could release undesired metal ions from aquifers (Keith et al. 2001; Nordstrom et al. 1999). These concerns severely compromise the potential use of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts in the water treatment industry.",
                        "Flow electrochemistry holds great potential for automatic pH regulation to support water treatment, wherein OH\u2212 and H+ generated from the cathode and anode, respectively, are redistributed based on ion migration, dispersion, and hydraulic flux (Acar et al. 2011)."

                        "The present invention relates to a Fenton-like water treatment process that bypasses the need of acid and generation of iron sludge precipitate, and makes the process more widely applicable to various conditions. This Fenton-like process is greener and more cost-effective than current methods.",
                        "Toxic organic compounds in water severely threaten drinking water safety, and require effective pretreatment. Hydroxyl radical produced by Fenton process (Fe2+/H2O2) can non-selectively destroy organic contaminants based on its strong oxidation potential. An upgraded reaction utilizing heterogeneous solid catalysts, called Fenton-like process, was recently adopted to overcome ferric sludge precipitation of Fenton process. However, most heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts operate optimally at pH 3-5, which acidity is challenging to create in near-neutral water bodies. The Ella process produced by electrochemical water splitting under flow-through conditions to facilitate the heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction. This Ella process boosted the activity of an immobilized iron oxychloride catalyst by over ten-fold in terms of hydroxyl radical yield, leading to near 100% destruction of various organic pollutants under high-throughput treatments. The robust performance in complex water bodies further highlights the promise of this scalable platform.",
                        "The Ella process uses a high-performance iron oxychloride nanocatalyst instead of free iron ion, an acid compartment induced by electrolysis instead of addition of acid. The immobilized iron oxychloride nanocatalyst is confined to the acid compartment.",
                        "The advantages of the Ella process include the ability to treat water contaminants in neutral solution without the addition of acids, prevent the generation of iron sludge waste as a secondary pollutant, and a simple operating procedure (i.e. by simply switching the electricity from the power supply). Also, the preparation of catalysts and induction of acid compartment are more cost-effective than previous homogeneous Fenton process, and contaminated water can be treated with high efficiency and robustness against complex water chemistry. Avoidance of secondary pollutants, and treatment of secondary contamination also provides a cost reduction.",
                        "The Ella process can be used in an advanced oxidation process in water treatment plants to replace the currently prevalent homogeneous Fenton process. The process can be used for water decontamination and disinfection of most surface water and groundwater as well as complex water bodies, such as industrial wastewater."

To this end, immobilized catalysts must be transferred to the acidic zone mediated by the Ella process, whereby H2O2 is rapidly transformed into oxidizing HO. radicals, leading to the instant degradation of organic compounds in the local vicinity (FIG. 1A). This coupled water treatment process is categorized as electro-Fenton-like (EFL) platform in this study. The flow-through treatment method is especially favored over batch reaction mode for industry application, since a water treatment plant treats high volume of contaminated water in a fast pace. Besides, it is worth of noting that the EFL platform can take advantage of the intermittent solar and wind electricity, often with near-zero or even negative prices.",
                                "The contaminants treatment efficiency by the EFL platform is majorly determined by the reaction during the transport through catalyst column, that is, longer retention time and higher catalyst and H2O2 concentration tend to result in more complete contaminants removal. Therefore, the key aspects to warrant the success of the EFL platform are to promote HO. generation and allow sufficient reaction time within the column."

A set of stable mixed metal oxide electrodes were installed 9 cm apart in a vertically anchored acrylic flow-through column device (15 cm\u00d75 cm O.D.). The column was filled with clean silica sand (0.15 to 0.6 mm) to maintain a laminar flow. A combination of 100 mA electric current and 15 mL/min hydraulic flow rate was applied to the neutral solution passing through the column, and solution pHs at various locations along the column were measured (FIG. 1B). The solution was homogeneously neutral without electric current; however, by turning on the 100 mA electric current, an acidic pH of 2.93-3.12 between the anode and cathode was automatically attained at steady state. The electrochemically created acidity is suitable for most Fenton-like catalysts. The effluent pH measured as 7.59 was close to the influent value (pH 7), showing minimal effect on the treated water pH. A reactive transport model that accounts for advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, and ion migration was used to simulate the pH profile (Hojabri et al. 2018). Modeling results indicate that the theoretical acidity of the confined space between electrodes using the above stated experimental settings is pH 2.8. The slight discrepancy of pH between experimental results and modelled value is possibly because the current efficiency of water electrolysis was not 100% due to possible energy losses in a non-ideal system."

                                "Iron oxychloride (FeOCl) was reported to possess extraordinary Fenton-like activity with high fidelity and can be mass produced (Sun et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2013). Characterizations of the synthetic FeOCl nanocatalyst produced via the calcination of FeCl3.6H2O were shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Bisphenol A (BPA) was used as the primary pollutant to illustrate FeOCl catalytic degradation performance, provided BPA is an environmental estrogen that disrupts human endocrine system upon exposure (Vanderberg et al. 2007). 10 \u03bcM BPA was rapidly degraded by the FeOCl/H2O2 reaction. On the contrary, the addition of ethanol, a strong HO. radical quencher (Adams et al. 1965), competed with BPA for the produced HO. radical reservoir and fully inhibited BPA removal by FeOCl/H2O2 reaction, demonstrating the degradation of BPA was via HO. radical (FIG. 10). The activity of synthesized FeOCl sample was tested by decomposing H2O2 for BPA removal. It was shown that 0.2 g/L FeOCl with 10 mM H2O2 at pH 3 could remove 86% 10 \u03bcM BPA in 6 min and 100% BPA in 8 min. The role of HO. radical in BPA removal was verified by ethanol as a scavenger, since it fully inhibited BPA removal via quenching HO. radical. The catalytic activities of FeOCl at different pHs were compared. Results showed that, the optimum pH for FeOCl is around pH 3 as it mediated the highest yield of HO. radical. It was further found that FeOCl showed optimal activity at pH 3, around 9.3-fold higher than that at pH 7 in terms of HO. radical yield (FIG. 4B).",
                                "Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was harnessed to study the catalysis mechanism of the FeOCl/H2O2 reaction. It was revealed that the reaction is accomplished via two electron-transfer processes (FIG. 5). In the first step, FeIIIOCl is at first reduced by H2O2 into FeIIOCl, and the second step the derived FeIIOCl then decomposes H2O2 into HO. radical via homolytic cleavage. The readily reducible nature of unsaturated Fe atoms on the exposed (100) surface of FeOCl crystals allows rapid turnovers of FeIII/II to catalyze the H2O2 transformation. Specifically, the energy barrier of reducing FeIII to FeII on FeOCl crystals by H2O2 was determined to be 0.235 eV (FIG. 6), whereas that of hematite (Fe2O3, a rhombohedral Fenton-like catalyst) is 0.76 eV as a comparison (Ji et al. 2019).",
                                "It is, however, a great concern that the micro catalyst particles are subject to fluid transport, resulting in potential draining from the silica sand pores within the column device. For instance, by packing well-mixed FeOCl and silica sand particles into the column (FIG. 7), the overall catalyst activity decayed by 36% after 8 h due to hydraulic erosion (FIG. 8). Another immobilization strategy of cross-linking FeOCl with alginate hydrogel was attempted for effective retention of FeOCl nanoparticles (FIG. 9) (Smidsr\u00f8d et al. 2019). However, the resulting FeOCl/alginate composite showed only 1% activity compared to the same amount of unimmobilized FeOCl catalyst (FIG. 10), delivering poor in-reactor performance under high flow rates (FIGS. 11 and 12). At pH 3, 0.2 g/L FeOCl and 10 mM H2O2 mediated formation of 305.3 \u03bcM HO. radical (FIG. 4B) after 30 min, while 0.075 g/mL FeOCl/alginate (dry weight, 1:2 FeOCl:alginate) produced 396.2 \u03bcM HO. radical (FIG. 10B). As a result, the specific activity of unimmobilized and immobilized FeOCl was calculated as 1511.5 and 15.8 \u03bcM HO./(g L\u22121) FeOCl, respectively. This is due to a large fraction of FeOCl particles becoming buried inside the hydrogel of the FeOCl/alginate composite and were not effectively accessible by H2O2 molecules.",
                                "To solve this problem, FeOCl nanoparticles were alternatively immobilized on a porous \u03b3-Al2O3 support via a melt infiltration method (FIG. 13A) (Eggenhuisen et al. 2010), with the belief that this approach offers maximum FeOCl catalytic sites for H2O2 molecules. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images clearly revealed the dispersion of FeOCl nanosheets on the amorphous \u03b3-Al2O3 support in the synthesized FeOCl/Al2O3 composite (FIGS. 13B-13D), with a surface area of 206 m2/g (Table 4). The compositional distribution of the FeOCl/Al2O3 was investigated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (FIG. 13E). EDX analysis identified Al, O, Fe, and Cl elements on the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. Elemental mapping results suggested that Al and Fe elements were separately located, in agreement with the overlay structure of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. Besides, Cl element exhibited consistent pattern with Fe element on the FeOCl surface, while O element was uniformly distributed on the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite disclosed several characteristic diffraction peaks (2\u03b8) at 11.2, 26.1, and 35.4\u00b0, which respectively belongs to the (010), (110), and (O21) plane of orthorhombic FeOCl crystal (PDF 01-072-0619) (FIG. 13F). The chemical states of compositional elements were studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, deconvoluted Fe 2p spectrum showed Fe3+2p1/2 (724.6 eV) and 2p3/2 (711.2 eV) were dominant over Fe2+2p1/2 (728.2 eV) and 2p3/2 (714.6 eV) (FIG. 13G), consistent with the unimmobilized FeOCl crystal (FIG. 3). XPS analyses of other elements in the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite and the \u03b3-Al2O3 support are shown in FIGS. 15 and 18. Overall, the above results suggested that the morphology and electronic properties of the FeOCl crystal remained intact after immobilization on the \u03b3-Al2O3 support.",
                                "Activity test results of the synthetic FeOCl/Al2O3 composite are shown in FIG. 16. It was found that 10 \u03bcM BPA was completely degraded in 10 min by 0.2 g/L of FeOCl/Al2O3 and 10 mM H2O2 at pH 3, while the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite or H2O2 alone led to negligible BPA removals. Further, under the stated conditions, FeOCl/Al2O3-mediated Fenton-like reaction produced the most remarkable amount of HO. radicals at pH 3 (i.e., 289.8 \u03bcM after reaction for 30 min), which acidity could be readily achieved by the Ella process. The catalytic performance of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite showed a consistent pattern with that of the unimmobilized FeOCl nanoparticle (FIG. 4), indicating that the \u03b3-Al2O3 support played no role in H2O2 transformation."

Neutral solutions containing 10 mM H2O2 oxidant and 10 \u03bcM BPA contaminant were pumped through the column at a rate of 15 mL/min, and BPA removals along the hydraulic flux direction were measured (FIG. 17B). Low BPA removal from the effluent (17.6%) was observed without electric current, due to the weak activity of FeOCl/Al2O3 under neutral condition. However, after a 100 mA electric current was applied to electrodes, gradual degradation of BPA took place as measured from the sampling ports, and BPA removal reached 100% in the effluent. Direct BPA degradation by electrodes was ruled out based on control experiment (FIG. 18). Additionally, the presence of 10 mM ethanol as HO. radical scavenger almost fully quenched BPA removal (FIG. 18), suggesting that in situ produced HO. radicals accounted for BPA degradation. As shown in FIG. 19, the HO. radicals generated by the EFL platform could also non-selectively degrade other organic contaminants including drugs (ibuprofen and carbamazepine), herbicide (atrazine), pesticide and drug precursors (4-chlorophenol and 4-nitrophenol), and recalcitrant dyes (rhodamine B, reactive blue 19, and orange II). It was further determined that the yield of HO. radical produced by the platform when 100 mA electric current was turned off and on was 23.5 and 254.4 \u03bcM, respectively (FIG. 17C). This 10.8-fold increase in HO. radical production was attributed to the acidic environment created by the Ella process which boosted FeOCl/Al2O3 catalyst activity. Results indicate that the EFL platform by coupling a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst and the Ella process in a flow-through column device is effective for removal of organic contaminants.",
                                "The long-term stability of BPA removal by the EFL platform was tested (FIG. 17D). Over the course of 8-h reactions, laminar fluid transport was maintained, and the BPA removal steadily approached 100%. BPA removal by this platform under different hydraulic flow rates was also measured (FIG. 17E). A high flow rate leads to shortened contact time among H2O2 molecules, the catalyst surface, and the organic contaminant, which reduces HO. radical yield and compromises contaminant removal. Over 95% of 10 \u03bcM BPA could be removed from the effluent at a flow rate of less than 20 mL/min, whereas BPA removal rate decreased to 82.4% and 44.4% at 25 and 30 mL/min, respectively. The tolerance of flow rate by using FeOCl/Al2O3 in this design was greatly superior than that by using FeOCl crosslinked on alginate hydrogel as a catalyst (FIG. 12), primarily due to the abundant catalytic sites exposed on the surface of the FeOCl/Al2O3 composite.",
                                "Responsiveness of BPA removal by the EFL platform to electric current was monitored by repeatedly turning the electric power supply on and off with a 60-min interval. As shown in FIG. 17F, BPA removal significantly increased after the 100 mA electric current was turned on for 15 min, and approached 100% after 40 min. As the power was turned off, BPA removal gradually decreased during the first 30 min, from 84.3-92.3% to 16.7-23.9%, and was steady afterwards. The non-instant response of BPA removal to electricity was presumably because of the slow accumulation and desorption of protons. Results demonstrated that electricity is a critical governor of contaminant removal by our developed platform. In addition, the observed response time in this study matches well with the intermittency of solar and wind electricity, and therefore our device can potentially provide clean drinking water without the need for battery energy storage.",
                                "Complex water environments are typically encountered in water treatment practices, posing challenges to downgradient treatment. For instance, water bodies receiving leachates from industries could be highly basic and require a pH neutralization process such as CO2 sequestration before biological/chemical treatment (Gomes et al. 2016). In this study, contaminants in a synthetic basic solution are treated by the EFL platform. Influent solutions of pH 7-11 were effectively acidified to around pH 3 under 100 mA electric current and 15 mL/min flow rate, in good agreement with modeling results (FIG. 20A). Consequently, BPA removals approached 100% under the Ella process-mediated acidic environment regardless of influent pH, whereas less than 22.4% of BPA was removed when the electric current was turned off (FIG. 20B).",
                                "The potential of water bodies to neutralize protons, namely water alkalinity, represents another challenge for acid-demanding chemical treatments due to the buffering carbonate ions, expressed as equivalent mg CaCO3/L (Lahay et al. 2007). Specifically, a substantial amount of acid is required to overcome high water alkalinity for the conventional Fenton process. BPA removal in synthetic solutions containing 0-200 mg CaCO3/L water alkalinity were tested by the EFL platform. Results show that, solution of higher alkalinity was less prone to acidification by the Ella process, but the acidic zone was still below pH 4.14 in all tests under 100 mA electric current and 15 mL/min flow rate (FIG. 20C). This acidity led to an 84.5%-100% removal efficiency of BPA, significantly higher than that when electric current was turned off (FIG. 20D). The acidity produced by the Ella process could be tuned against water buffering capacity by adjusting applied electric current and hydraulic flow rate. For instance, a combination of 60 mA electric current and 2 mL/min flow rate is able to acidify a solution of 500 mg CaCO3/L alkalinity from pH 8 to pH 3.5 (Yuan et al. 2013)."

                                "Compared with the conventional Fenton process, the required energy for electrochemical water splitting by this integral EFL platform is estimated to be 1.39 kWh/m3 influent, which translates into a cost of $0.091/m3 based on the average US industrial electricity rate ($0.0653/kWh) (Average Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers by End-Use Sector, 2020). This value is subjected to optimization based on applied electric current, hydraulic flow rate, and solution conductivity, but it only constitutes around 10% of unit operating cost by modern water treatment plants (Guo et al. 2014). Besides, the cost of \u03b3-Al2O3 and FeCl3.6H2O is estimated as $0.5/kg (Aluminum Oxide Price, 2020) and $0.3/kg (Ferric Chloride Price, 2020), respectively. This means it takes less than $0.0005 to synthesize 1 g of FeOCl/Al2O3 catalyst, and we used \u02dc50 g of synthesized catalyst particles for our device. By considering the long-term stability of this catalyst, its cost is indeed negligible. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical synthesis of highly concentrated H2O2 (Chen et al. 2017; Yamanaka et al. 2003) could be used as a replacement of externally supplied H2O2 in the future, further reducing the overall chemical cost.",
                                "Moreover, the EFL water treatment platform developed in this study is applied to practical implementation after upscaling. The fast response of the EFL platform in removing organic pollutants especially allows for smart controls at low cost. In addition, it possesses the easy-to-(un)install feature that makes it affordable and compatible with other connecting units of a centralized water treatment facility. For instance, a feasible niche of this device is to function as an electrochemical filter before advanced purification units requiring removal of fouling hazards such as organic molecules and biofilm-forming bacteria (Guo et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 1990). On the small size end, the EFL platform is designed to provide clean drinking water for individual families without electrical grid, by coupling with cheap photovoltaic sources."

The acidic pH produced by the Ella process (100 mA electric current and 15 mL/min flow rate) mediated a 10.8-fold increase in HO. yield, which contributed to the complete removal of contaminants in the effluent. The EFL platform showed strong stability for long-term use, tolerance of high water flux, and effectiveness against complex water chemistry for organic contaminant removal. The setup configuration is advantageous in that it provides high degree of automation that enables water treatment by controlling the electric power, and low operating cost that most modern water treatment plants strive for, both of which are especially attractive for industrial applications.",
