    "title": "A Quantitative Centrosomal Amplification Score Predicts Local Recurrence of Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i>",
    "date": "2020-06-15",
    "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to predict risk of local recurrence (LR) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a new visualization and quantification approach using centrosome amplification (CA), a cancer cell\u2013specific trait widely associated with aggressiveness. Experimental Design: This first-of-its-kind methodology evaluates the severity and frequency of numerical and structural CA present within DCIS and assigns a quantitative centrosomal amplification score (CAS) to each sample. Analyses were performed in a discovery cohort (DC, n = 133) and a validation cohort (VC, n = 119). Results: DCIS cases with LR exhibited significantly higher CAS than recurrence-free cases. Higher CAS was associated with a greater risk of developing LR (HR, 6.3 and 4.8 for DC and VC, respectively; P < 0.001). CAS remained an independent predictor of relapse-free survival (HR, 7.4 and 4.5 for DC and VC, respectively; P < 0.001) even after accounting for potentially confounding factors [grade, age, comedo necrosis, and radiotherapy (RT)]. Patient stratification using CAS (P < 0.0001) was superior to that by Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI; HR for CAS = 6.2 vs. HR for VNPI = 1.1). Among patients treated with breast-conserving surgery alone, CAS identified patients likely to benefit from adjuvant RT. Conclusions: CAS predicted 10-year LR risk for patients who underwent surgical management alone and identified patients who may be at low risk of recurrence, and for whom adjuvant RT may not be required. CAS demonstrated the highest concordance among the known prognostic models such as VNPI and clinicopathologic variables such as grade, age, and comedo necrosis.",

                "Approximately 20% of screen-detected breast cancers (BC) are DCIS, a pre-invasive form of BC wherein malignant epithelial cells are confined to the lumen of a mammary duct and do not invade into the adjacent stroma (1,2). Notably, 20-53% of women with untreated DCIS progress to invasive BC over a period of \u226510 years (3). Since the progressive potential of a DCIS lesion cannot be reliably determined, local control via surgical excision with or without local radiotherapy is the mainstay strategy, with addition of endocrine blockade in some cases (4). Unfortunately, 10-35% of DCIS patients treated with lumpectomy or breast conservation surgery (BCS) later present with a local recurrence (LR) and about half of all recurrences occur in the form of invasive breast cancer (IBC) (5,6). A major challenge is to avoid under-or over-treatment by developing prognostic biomarkers that can stratify DCIS patients based on their recurrence risk.",
                "Current predictors of recurrence risk for DCIS such as the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) (7) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering DCIS nomogram (8) are based on routinely-used clinicopathological parameters but lack consistency and reproducibility in risk prediction (9,10). In addition, these tools do not integrate prognostically-informative molecular predictors, and underestimate DCIS heterogeneity.",
                "While Oncotype Dx Breast DCIS score, a commercially-available gene-expression based assay, has some value in predicting LR, it has only been validated in two cohorts (ECOG E5194 and Ontario DCIS). The poor stratification of high/intermediate-risk patients in these two cohorts has called into question the prognostic value of this tool (11).",
                "Extensive genetic and phenotypic intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) characterizes DCIS (12,13). In a pre-invasive lesion, higher ITH predicts greater likelihood of LR and invasive BC (14). Amplified centrosomes underlie erroneous mitoses and fuel chromosomal instability (CIN), which is a wellrecognized driver of ITH (15,16). Although normal cells have one centrosome pre-S-phase and two centrosomes post-S-phase, cancer cells invariably display centrosome amplification (CA); an abnormal increase in the number (i.e., numerical amplification) and/or volume (i.e., structural amplification) of centrosomes (17). Semi-quantitative studies have shown that CA correlates with higher tumor grade, larger tumor size, disease recurrence and/or distant metastasis in various malignancies (18). Moreover, CA occurs within precancerous and preinvasive lesions including DCIS, suggesting that CA is an early event in tumorigenesis (19,20). CA increases with higher DCIS grade, and high-grade (HG) DCIS has elevated expression of Aurora-A and Nek2 kinases that are strongly associated with CA. In addition, the risk of LR in DCIS is predictable by dysregulation of genes like cyclin-D, cyclin-E, and p53/p21 that regulate the centrosome duplication process (21). In the present study, we postulated that recurrent and non-recurrent DCIS cases might differ in the extent and/or type of CA. The prognostic value of CA has remained unexplored for clinical application, as there is no methodology available for the rigorous quantitation of CA phenotypes. Also, it is unclear whether the prognostic value of CA lies in numerical and/or structural CA. It is unknown which of the two features of CA--frequency (i.e., percentage of cells showing amplified centrosomes), and/or severity (i.e., how abnormal the number/volume of centrosomes is in a given sample) --is prognostically informative.",
                "Herein, we present a new methodology for centrosomal phenotyping to quantitate both numerical and structural centrosomal aberrations in clinical tissue samples. Centrosomes were immunofluorescently stained using an antibody against \u03b3-tubulin, and co-stained nuclei with Hoechst. Our analytical procedure allows robust interrogation of the capacity of centrosomal overload to predict the risk of LR after a lumpectomy. We have developed an algorithm that quantitates the frequency/prevalence and severity of CA (both numerical and structural) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) clinical samples, and computes a centrosome amplification score (CAS) for each sample. CAS is a promising metric that may improve treatment recommendations and allow identification of patients at low risk of recurrence for whom adjuvant RT may not be required. CAS demonstrates the highest concordance among the known prognostic models such as VNPI and commonly used clinicopathological variables such as grade, age, and comedo necrosis."

Tumor tissue were preserved by standard approved processing methods using formalin fixation and embedding in paraffin. These tumor blocks were stored in the Nottingham tissue bank. Patients had (a) adequate amount of tissue, (b) available all relevant clinicopathologic data, and (c) at least 10 years of follow-up were eventually included in the study. The samples for the study were shared in three batches. For the pilot study to estimate the sample size, samples for the first 50 consecutive cases that met inclusion criteria were shared and based upon our findings, the proposed sample size of 116 for each cohort was expected to yield a power of 80% with an alpha of 0.05 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Subsequently, samples for the next 83 cases were shared which together with the earlier 50 samples formed the discovery cohort (DC). The validation cohort (VC) was received only after the study (staining, imaging, and image analysis) on the DC was completed. To exclude any bias, the GSU research group were totally blinded to clinicopathologic and outcome details of the patients included in the study. These data were not shared with GSU research team who performed the staining, imaging, and image analysis until the CAS scores were generated for each patient in all cohorts. The discovery cohort (DC) (n=133) and validation cohort (VC) (N=119) comprised of consecutive pure DCIS patients (no evidence of microinvasive or invasive breast cancer) with available tissue samples that showed free surgical margins >2mm (to avoid the effect of this confounder on the study outcome) and underwent BCS or mastectomy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) (Supplementary Fig. 2) (22)(23)(24). All cases were histologically reviewed, and diagnoses were confirmed by two independent pathologists (MST and IM, and in case of disagreement between the two reviewing pathologists the specialist breast pathologist (EAR) confirmed the diagnosis). All cases included data pertaining to their clinicopathologic variables such as age at diagnosis, menopausal status, DCIS size, nuclear grade, presence of comedo-type necrosis, treatment, VNPI, Ki67 proliferation index, and information about treatment (adjuvant RT), recurrence-free survival (RFS) defined by the time (in months) between 6 months after the first surgery and occurrence of ipsilateral LR in the form of either DCIS or IBC, date of initial diagnosis, date of surgery, and patient status at last contact (23). Patients who underwent completion surgery within the first 6 months after primary resection surgery due to positive/close surgical margins or presence of residual tumor tissue were not considered to have disease recurrence. All patients who developed contralateral breast events were censored at the time of development of the contralateral tumor. None of the patients in our discovery/validation cohorts received adjuvant endocrine therapy.",

All study aspects were (a) approved by every Institutional Review Board, and (b) in compliance with guidelines in material transfer and data use agreements for all involved institutions, and Georgia State University.

To exclude non-specific signals, a common background subtraction was applied to all images. This parameter was derived by first measuring the average diameter of ~100 centrosomes in 10 ROIs (Fig. 1), and then using the background corresponding to this average diameter as the background subtraction threshold. Finally, data from all optical sections were ordered to enable volume measurement for each centrosome. The final data of volumes of all centrosomes were then compared to a maximum intensity projection image and centrosomes for each cell were quantified based on proximity to their associated nuclei. The number and volume of all centrosomes associated with each nucleus in the tumor area were recorded."

The volume range for a normal centrosome was determined by analyzing volumes of centrosomes from both adjacent uninvolved tissue from cancer patients and normal breast tissue from disease-free individuals (Supplementary Fig. 3). For adjacent uninvolved tissues, the selected cohort (n=40 patients) had a median age of 53.5 years (age range: 38-69.5 years). We evaluated centrosomal volumes in these samples as described in the analysis section. The mean centrosome volume for the adjacent uninvolved tissue sections was higher relative to the normal tissue from reduction mammoplasty. Thus, we chose the smallest and largest values for individual centrosome volume from normal tissue as the \"normal centrosome volume range\" for breast tissue. The mean volume of centrosomes in normal breast epithelial cells ranged from 0.2-0.74 \u00b5m 3 . Centrosomes with volumes > 0.74 \u00b5m 3 were categorized as mCTRs. All centrosomes in each ROI were thus categorized as iCTRs or mCTRs. In other words, mCTRs are centrosomes with aberrantly large volumes and are considered to represent structurally amplified centrosomes. The numbers and volumes of each iCTR and mCTR associated with each nucleus in an ROI were recorded."

Both univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, with age, grade, comedo necrosis, and RT controlled, were built to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between high vs. low CAStotal groups. A non-zero slope was detected in a generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time, which satisfied of the proportional hazards assumption (Supplementary Fig. 5). A 2X2 confusion matrix and performance metrics was used for sensitivity analysis. The fitted Cox models were also used to predict the approximate 10-year recurrence rate using SAS PROC PHREG module.

Intriguingly, none of these clinicopathological variables showed any significant association with RFS in multivariate analyses (Table 2A), thereby indicating the limited capacity of traditional clinicopathological variables to predict LR for DCIS in our DC. Our VC was also from Nottingham University Hospital, UK (patient characteristics in Table 1B) and comprised of 119 DCIS patients out of which 24 patients presented with ipsilateral LR. Median age of these patients was 56 years, and the median follow-up was 121 months.

Interestingly, DCIS patients that developed LR within 10 years showed significantly higher CASi relative to LR-free patients (p=<0.0001; Fig. 2C). These patients with LR showed greater severity (CASi severity) (p=0.25; Supplementary Fig. 8A) and higher frequency (CASi frequency) (p<0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 8B) of numerical CA compared to LR-free patients. Analysis of structural CA revealed that CASm was significantly higher (p=0.04, Fig. 2D) for the LR subgroup relative to LR-free subgroup. DCIS with LR exhibited greater severity (CASm severity) (p=0.01, Supplementary Fig. 8C) and frequency (CASm frequency) (p=0.08, Supplementary Fig. 8D) of structural CA compared to LR-free DCIS.

In all samples, \u03b3-tubulin foci invariably overlapped with centrin-2 foci, confirming that both structurally and numerically amplified centrosomes are bona fide centrosomes and not simply aggregates of pericentriolar material. We also observed that none of the mCTRs had >2 centrin-2 foci, suggesting that enlarged \u03b3-tubulin foci represent structurally augmented centrosomes and not supernumerary centrosomes that are tightly clustered to be indistinguishable (Supplementary Fig. 12)."

Similarly, high CASm was associated with poorer RFS (p=0.04, HR=2.396) compared to low CASm (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 13C,13D, and Supplementary Table 2).

Although presence of comedo necrosis and CAStotal were associated with RFS in univariate analyses, only CAStotal remained significantly associated with RFS in multivariable analyses (Table 2A). Furthermore, when similar cox regression univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for CASi and CASm separately CASi and CASm was the strongest and most significant independent predictor of RFS respectively (Supplementary Table 3A and4A) Similar results were evident for the cases that were treated only with lumpectomy (Supplementary Fig. 14).",

Next, we determined if our survival model had high predictive accuracy using the Harrell's concordance index. The higher the concordance index, the better the survival model discriminates between patients who experienced LR versus those who remained LRfree. The results indicated that any patient with a poorer/shorter RFS had a 72.6% probability of being in the high CAStotal group. Also, we created a 2x2 confusion matrix performance metrics to show the accuracy of CAS to predict 10-year LR. To do so, we calculated the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy (Acc) of CAS and odds ratio (OR which represents the increase in odds of a patient in a high-risk group developing recurrence relative to a patient in a low-risk group), for both cohorts to compare the performance of CAS with that of the traditional clinicopathological variables (those used in the Cox regression analysis). As presented in the tables below, our CAStotal yielded an accuracy (or Acc) of 0.60, sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.53, PPV of 0.32, NPV of 0.93, and OR of 6.8 in the DC (Supplementary Table 9).

For example, the RR forest plot (Supplementary Fig. 23A) for high grade DCIS patients in the DC showed that patients with comedo necrosis (red), are at high risk of recurrence (0.59) compared to the overall RR for patients (0.33), regardless of the CAS of their tumors. When we further stratified these DCIS patients with comedo necrosis into high (green) and low (blue) CAS groups, we observed that the RR for the high CAS group (green) was 0.83 and RR for the low CAS subgroup (blue) was 0.10. Similar results were observed for VC (see RR forest plot in Supplementary Fig. 23B). Thus, CAS was able to more deeply segment the patients with comedo necrosis into high and low risk LR groups. Similar trends were evident for tumor size, RT, and age."

                "The widely used VNPI is based on patients' age at diagnosis, tumor size, resection margin width and tumor grade. To test the performance of this index in our (DC and VC combined) cohort, we calculated VNPI based on scoring methods described in the literature. Each of the factors was assigned a score between 1-3, and the sum of scores for the four parameters (i.e., the final VNPI score) was used to stratify patients into high, low and intermediate risk groups for LR, employing the binary cutoff score of \u00b38. Next, we compared the performance of VNPI and CAStotal in cases from the DC and VC (n=164) (Fig. 4A and4B) using univariate and Kaplan Meier survival analyses. We found that higher VNPI was not significantly associated with poorer RFS and VNPI did not significantly stratify patients as high and low risk of LR subgroups. By contrast, CAStotal stratified DC and VC patients into subgroups of high and low risk of LR with greater significance and HRs (CAStotal HR=5.6 vs. VNPI HR=0.70) (Supplementary Table 10). Multivariable analyses adjusted for other potentially confounding factors, such as tumor size, presence of comedo necrosis, age, and RT along with VNPI and CAS, revealed that CAStotal showed the highest association with RFS, with a HR=6.86 (Supplementary Table 11).",

                "DCIS exhibits considerable inter-patient heterogeneity and has a poorly understood natural history. A lack of accurate models for prediction of risk of LR results in over-and under-treatment, complicated by the variable prognostic evidence of patient age, tumor margins, DCIS grade, and size. CA is a hallmark of cancers and is observable in >80% of breast tumors including pre-invasive lesions, and is associated with high grade in DCIS and IBC (18,19). Amplified centrosomes are present in premalignant cells and increase as the disease progresses to dysplasia, highlighting the potential involvement of CA in neoplastic transformation and progression (25).",
                "Our laboratory has previously shown that (a) high levels of CA are associated with poor progressionfree survival in invasive breast tumors, and (b) CA is higher in the aggressive TNBC subtype compared to grade-matched non-TNBCs (26,27). This notion was further validated by analysis of the CA20 gene score, which is based on genes associated with CA (28). Recent studies have reported that higher CA induces high-grade features in BCs; thus, CA has been associated with tumor evolution (29). Although studies have reported that BCs exhibit structurally amplified centrosomes, they have not yet established the prognostic value of this structural CA (30). This may be due, in part, to the 2D (i.e., cross-sectional) approaches used in these studies, which have limitations to accurately capture the 3D size of the centrosome. Moreso, most studies (31) examining CA in BCs have not rigorously evaluated confounding effects of other clinicopathologic variables on the prognostic value of CA.",
                "Our new semi-automated methodology uses quantitative centrosomal phenotyping and an algorithm to measure both numerical and structural centrosomal aberrations in DCIS tumors. For each sample, a continuous CAS was computed that categorized patients as having a high or low 10-year risk of LR.",
                "Findings from our retrospective study, which involved two large, well-characterized cohorts (DC and VC) of DCIS cases, showed that patients with LR within 10 years exhibited higher CAStotal relative to LR-free patients. Our study is the first to show that organellar-level differences distinguish DCIS patients with LR from LR-free patients, and that high levels of both numerical and structural CA are associated with increased 10-year risk of LR in DCIS patients. Our results suggest that aberrant centrosomal homeostasis in DCIS drives pathophysiological alterations that potentially facilitate disease progression through CIN-dependent as well as CIN-independent mechanisms. While CA may drive ITH through CIN, an increased centrosome complement may, via modulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton, enhance directional migration and invasion of malignant cells and thus enhance the risk of LR in the longer term (32). We have demonstrated that CAStotal is significantly and independently associated with poor RFS, and upon inclusion of both CAStotal and VNPI into multivariable models, we found that CAStotal outperforms VNPI in predicting LR. CAStotal predicts the 10-year risk of LR with higher concordance than VNPI. In DCIS patient subsets, defined based on their clinical and histopathological parameters, stratification by CAStotal prognostically augmented several clinicopathologic parameters in determining rate of recurrence. Among subsets of DCIS patients treated with BCS or those receiving additional adjuvant RT, CAStotal identified patients with high risk of LR.",
                "Thus, CAStotal can be used as a clinical tool to identify patients who can be safely treated with BCS/mastectomy alone, and those who will benefit from the inclusion of RT. Our centrosomal profiling methodology, which dichotomizes DCIS patients into high-and low-risk categories, enables clear go/no-go therapeutic decision making, and can substantially augment individualized management of DCIS based upon risk conferred by the patient's centrosomal complement. CAS, as the linear expression of the severity and frequency of numerical and structural CA, may serve as an indirect measure of ITH in DCIS. Our study, the first to robustly quantify CA in both pure and mixed DCIS samples, has contributed evidence supporting a model of CA-driven DCIS progression into IBC. These findings concur with previous studies wherein we, and others, observed that TNBC, the most aggressive subtype of BC, exhibits highest CA among all BC subtypes (26,29). Centrosome profiling can complement clinicopathologic and genomic evaluation to provide a comprehensive portrait of disease status. An exciting avenue for future research is to profile CA in all the stages of tumor progression starting from atypical hyperplasia to invasive and metastatic disease to evaluate if CA can function as a biomarker for tumor evolution.",
                "The commercially available Oncotype Dx DCIS score is applicable mainly to cases with resection margins of at least 3 mm and low/intermediate-grade DCIS measuring \u22642.5 cm, or in high-grade DCIS of \u22641 cm, as this is the set of patients from the ECOG 5194 study upon which the test was initially clinically validated (11). By contrast, our quantitative centrosomal phenotyping methodology is more broadly applicable and could be refined for other cancer types with rampant CA. The gene signature that comprises the basis of the Oncotype DCIS Score consists mainly of proliferation-related genes. CA is a phenotypic biomarker that serves as a readout of hundreds of deregulated signaling pathways that culminate in numerical and/or structural CA, including dysregulated proliferation-related signaling cascades. Thus, our methodology captures prognostic information from a broader swath of biological pathways that are deregulated in and drive the biology of DCIS. CAS-based risk profiling of core biopsies may reduce the number of re-excisions even in the event of close/positive margins.",
                "However, our study has a few limitations. There are imbalances in the number of patients in different subgroups, in the DC and the VC of the study, which has resulted in better performance of CAS (higher HR) in the DC. While the DC has more high-grade patients, the VC has a balanced number of high, intermediate, and low-grade patients. High-grade patients tend to present with invasive recurrence. A higher number of patients recurred as invasive in the DC and patients with invasive recurrence exhibited higher CAS when compared to patients who recurred as DCIS in DC. Whereas, in VC due to more balanced numbers of high, intermediate, and low-grade patients, no such variation in the type of LR was observed. Furthermore, lack of receptor status in some cases precluded study of the confounding effect of receptors in this dataset. The study cohort did not include any patients treated with endocrine therapy. These limitations in the DC and VC perhaps lead to the slightly different performance of CAS among the two cohorts. Validation studies in external cohorts and mechanistic studies to understand the role of CA-associated proteins in DCIS progression model are warranted.

(B) mCTRs were defined as centrosomes in a neoplastic region that stain positive for \u03b3-tubulin and whose volume is greater than the upper limit of the centrosome volume range found in corresponding normal tissue immunostained for \u03b3-tubulin. Thus, mCTRs are centrosomes with aberrantly large volumes and are considered to represent structurally amplified centrosomes.      "

Therefore, cancer cells with 1 or 2 iCTRs do not contribute to this component. Since cells with larger numbers of iCTRs represent severe numerical CA, a linear measurement was implemented to provide a measure of the number of iCTRs (above the baseline value of 2) in a given cell by computing the score (Ni -2) for each cell. Finally, an average of all these scores is determined.
