    "title": "PROCESS AND ITS APPLICATION FOR IMPROVING REPRODUCIBILITY IN MALDI-TOF GLYCAN PROFILING OF HUMAN SERUM: EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND APPLICATION TO THE SCREENING FOR OVARIAN TUMORS",
    "date": "2013-07-10 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "Disclosed is that the most crucial point in the quantitative analysis of MALDI-TOF MS is to minimize quantitative variances (RSDs, relative standard deviations) of peak intensities of obtained spectrum data. The minimized RSD is translated into improved reproducibility of the data and finally leads to high accuracy of the results. Several technical procedures based on the concept of automatization to reduce the RSDs (to less than 10%) in the MALDI-TOF MS of serum glycans were proposed for the preparation steps of extracting the targeted glycans from human blood and sample loading processes onto the plates. The presented techniques described in the examples proved the contributions of the present invention to enhanced reproducibility of the MALDI-TOF MS and consequently to improved screening accuracy for the differentiation of the benign ovarian tumor patients from the borderline ovarian tumor patients in comparison with accuracy of differentiation based on other analysis methods.",

                        "(a) Field of the Invention",
                        "The present invention relates to a method for glycan analysis with improved reproducibility of the quantitative MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric profiling of the glycans in human serum. Further, the present invention relates to a cancer screening method by using the glycan analytical method. In addition, the present invention relates to a differentiation method of benign ovarian tumors from borderline ovarian tumors by using the glycan analytical method.",
                        "(b) Description of the Related Art",
                        "Recently, studies that use serum glycans for identifying and predicting specific diseases, thereby allowing clinical diagnosis, research studies, and practical applications, have been well received. From previous studies and patents, it has been discovered that the glycosylation of tumors can change for the cases of ovarian, breast, prostate, liver, lung, gastric, pancreatic, and many other malignant tumors.",
                        "It has been reported that glycosylation of proteins changes when tumors arise, which alters the levels of oligosaccharides in serum glycoproteins. Some of the glycoprotein changes are suggested as potential biomarkers for various diseases. Particularly, a considerable part of mucin, which is classified as one of highly glycosylated glycol-proteins, is known as a glycan. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 7,651,847 demonstrated that screening and diagnosing ovarian and breast cancers and predicting the cancer development stages were possible by following the pattern analysis of the mass spectra of oligosaccharides isolated and purified from blood samples of cancer-inflicted patients.",
                        "Most of the cancer screening and diagnostic methods of quantitative measuring tumor markers in human blood have been attempted by a technique which finds the value of a single marker in the human serum by immune response of an antigen-antibody and then compares it with cut-off values derived from a clinical cumulative database. For example, CA-125 (cancer antigen 125, mucin 16) is reported as a common biomarker for ovarian cancer; the amount of CA-125 produced in the body increases for patients inflicted with ovarian cancer. However, CA-125 is a highly heterogeneous glycoprotein and this makes the antigen-antibody immunological response of the mucin inaccurate and difficult to quantify depending on the various types of ovarian cancer. Women with endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease also display high concentrations of CA-125, which causes a tendency of false positive responses. Consequently, CA-125 is not a proper cancer marker to be selected for diagnosing the beginning stage of ovarian cancer.",
                        "In order to overcome the limit of a single tumor marker such as CA-125, in the US patent mentioned above, all glycans in the serum of a cancer patient were separated and quantitatively measured through mass spectrometry. The profiles of the glycan spectrum were compared by pattern analysis with those of glycans from the serum of people who are not cancer patients. The patent has proved the successful screening results of the early stage of ovarian and breast cancer patients from healthy persons.",
                        "The Mass spectrometry they used was MALDI-FTICR (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption and Ionization\u2014Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance), which has excellent power at high resolution. However, it is clear that that instrument is not appropriate for local clinics or diagnostic laboratories to use for early stage cancer screening purposes due to the expensive price of the instrument and the long time consumed to obtain the mass spectrometry. To conquer these handicaps, the present invention adapts the MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption and Ionization\u2014Time of Flight), which is one of the most widely used instruments, and provided mass spectrometry and analyzes hundreds of glycan samples quickly at one time of sample loading, resultantly offering the technology to discover multiple cancer markers and to screen cancer and tumor patients from healthy persons by using it.",
                        "In case of separating early stage cancer patients from healthy persons, sometimes the differences of the markers' intensities are not distinctive enough to screen, so the reproducibility of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric signals must be very critical, for MALDI-TOF tends to show the variation of peak intensity intrinsically from each data gaining time. To drastically improve the reproducibility of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric signals, the present invention introduces new processes for the glycan extraction step and the glycan loading step onto the plate for instrumental measurement."

Therefore, it is very important for the coefficient of variation of each peak's intensity at every measurement of MALDI-TOF to be minimized and consistent.",

Before loading the samples onto the circular area of the Plate #2, however, the matrix crystal was layered at each area by spraying the matrix-diluted solution several times and by heating the plate while spraying to induce fast drying, consequently making the matrix crystal more compact and even. After this, the solution of glycans extracted from the serum sample was deposited on the matrix pre-spotted area of the Plate #2 and then it was quickly dried at reduced pressure in order to induce co-crystallization of the matrix and the glycan as evenly as possible.",
                        "By introducing a series of new processes into the analytical method of serum glycans by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the coefficients of variation of the glycan intensities of the different spectra at the same molecular weight (which is m/z) decreased to less than 10%, or more preferably to the range of 5%, while the CVs of the glycans measured by conventional technology was around 20%. This enhanced reproducibility of the new MALDI-TOF analytical methods can not only screen out the cancer patients such as those with ovarian cancer, which are known to be difficult to screen at an early stage, can but also differentiate tumor patients whose physiological characteristics are quite similar.",
                        "According to specific examples of the invention, Group #1 of mass spectra were obtained from the sera of 169 benign ovarian tumor patients by applying the quantitative mass spectrometric analytical method presented by the present invention. Then, these mass spectra of Group #1 were compared with the mass spectra of Group #2 whose glycans were derived from the sera of 68 borderline ovarian tumor patients, and then 72 tumor-specific peaks of m/z, which showed up at every mass spectrum (in other words, having 100% frequencies), were selected as markers. By comparing the analysis of these markers, the cut-off values of each individual marker were fixed.",
                        "In addition, by the two separate blind validation tests, the glycan mass spectrometry analysis has proved to have 23% better sensitivity and 13% better specificity than the conventional tumor marker of CA-125, respectively. Furthermore, by using only one MALDI-TOF instrument, the sera of about 100 people can be concurrently analyzed and then interpreted for the screening of cancer and/or for differentiating tumors within 48 hours, which offers commercially available processes.",

                        "This Plate #1 in the present invention can play a role of a micro-reactor to pre-treat the samples for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis. Enzyme digestion reactions may be performed and then glycans may be released from the proteins at each well of the Plate #1. This Plate #1 usually consists of multiple areas (or wells), and these areas may respectively hold tubes carrying samples or these wells may contain samples directly in them without the separate tubes, which results in the rapid analysis of many samples at one time.",
                        "The numbers and the shapes of the wells in the above Plate #1 are not specifically limited, but preferably, two or more wells can be arrayed in the Plate #1. For example, commercially available plates with 6, 12, 24, 48, or 96 wells can be used.",
                        "In the present invention, each serum sample from each patient can be injected into each well of the Plate #1. Here, the injection means to put the sample into the well of the Plate #1 directly or to place the sample-containing tube in the holes (areas) of the Plate #1. The samples can be injected as a mixed solution with a buffer solution after blending prior to the injection. The buffer solution can be an ammonium bicarbonate solution, but other buffer solutions can be used.",
                        "The step (b) is the glycan extraction step by enzyme digestion reaction at each area of the Plate #1 to extract one or more glycans from the samples.",
                        "The above step (b) can be further divided into following (b-1) to (b-3):",
                        "(b-1) denaturing the proteins in the human serum sample by heating the Plate #1;",
                        "(b-2) treating glycan-releasing enzyme with the sample to release glycans from the proteins in the sample; and",
                        "(b-3) separating at least one glycan from the proteins in the sample.",
                        "The above step (b-1) is the denaturing reaction of the proteins. The sample in the Plate #1 can be mixed with dithiothreitol and heated in the water bath at temperatures above 90\u00b0 C., or at 95\u00b0 C. as a better example, in order to denature the proteins.",
                        "The above step (b-2) is the reaction step of the sample with the enzyme. As an example, peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) can be injected into the sample to extract the glycans.",
                        "To get a good result, the above enzyme digestion reaction can be executed in a water bath while irradiating the bath with microwaves horizontally parallel to the surface of the water bath.",
                        "Enzyme reactions are usually executed in the water bath for 16 to 24 hours (so-called overnight) at 37\u00b0 C. In the present invention, however, the enzyme reaction could be rapidly completed by irradiating the enzyme reaction with microwaves horizontally to the surface of the water by floating or placing the Plate #1 which contains a large number of sample-containing wells in order to process many samples simultaneously in a batch for the purpose of commercial application of the present invention. As an example, the water bath harboring the Plate #1 can be irradiated with microwaves of 400 W for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Once the samples are exposed to microwaves, microwave energy stimulates the movement of all molecules including serum proteins in each well of the plate, which increases the reaction speed, quickly reaching the ending point of the enzyme digestion reaction.",
                        "Preferably, the above water bath can include not only a magnetron, which is the source of microwaves, but also inlet holes for the air bubbles. Since the microwaves are controlled by a temperature-dependent device, a higher temperature induced by microwaves in the water bath will stop the generation of microwaves above a certain set temperature. In order to maintain the microwave generation and thus to further accelerate the enzyme reaction with microwaves, the water bath should be cooled to below the set temperature immediately after reaching the set temperature. Air bubbles which are generated from holes at the bottom of the water bath equipped with a small air pump will induce the flow of air bubbles from the bottom for fast heat dissipation, which leads to a lower temperature and consequent switching on of the microwave generation. In this mechanism, the temperature of the water bath is maintained with oscillations in a very small range (\u00b10.5\u00b0 C.), while microwaves are emitted constantly at regular time intervals. This constant microwave irradiation eventually results in the completion of the enzyme reaction in a much shorter time, emphasizing the need for a cooling device for the water bath such as the example of air bubbles and related air pumps in this embodiment.",
                        "FIG. 3a shows the loading process of the Plate #1 on the surface of the water bath in the microwave irradiation system, and FIG. 4a is a schematic diagram of the water bath equipped with the microwave irradiating system, which shows a conceptual side view of the bath. As shown in above figures, the Plate #1 can be loaded parallel on the surface of the water bath and the microwaves are radiated horizontally from the side wall of the cylindrical bath, while air bubbles travel continuously from the entrance holes at the bottom to the surface by forming the bubbles and turbulence. The above schematic design is, however, just one example to embody the present invention, which means that the invention is not confined to this example and this equipment at all.",
                        "The above step (b-3) is the separation step of one or more glycans from serum proteins in the samples. As one example, the proteins can be removed by alcohol precipitation after enzyme reaction.",
                        "More particularly, the glycans can be separated by the step of precipitating the above proteins by adding absolute ethanol to the sample solution after the enzyme reaction, the step of removing the precipitated proteins, and the step of eluting one or more glycans from the above step.",
                        "As an example, after mixing the sample solution with ethanol in a 1:4 (volume/volume) ratio, the proteins can be precipitated at \u221280\u00b0 C. Once the precipitates are formed, they can be removed by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant solutions are transferred to new tubes, where all solvents are removed in speed vacuum dryers. From the completely dried materials, one or more glycans can be purified and eventually eluted by the solid phase extraction process.",
                        "The step to elute one or more glycans from the above sample can be carried out by pouring an acetonitrile solution into the sample. For example, a graphite carbon column can be prepared by equilibration with distilled water, with an acetonitrile solution, and with distilled water one more times, sequentially. The samples dried by the speed-vacuum evaporator are then dissolved in distilled water, and the solution is introduced into the column.",
                        "As the next step, distilled water is used to wash off any salt from the columns, and secondly, an ACN solution is injected to finally elute glycans. The ACN solution for eluting glycans can have a 10% and 20% concentration in distilled water, respectively, or a 40% concentration in water additionally including trifluoroacetic acid at a 0.05% concentration. The volume of the above solutions for the elution of one or more glycans can be around 4 mL to 10 mL.",
                        "The above step (a) and step (b) in the present invention are the process for treating the samples. Therefore, a multi-pipette system can be used to inject several samples into the multiple wells or to extract several samples in the Plate #1 at the same time. As an example, Liquidator 96 provided by Mettler Toledo can be used in this step, but is not limited to this.",
                        "In the step (c), the matrix solution is sprayed onto the area and the matrix on each area of the Plate #2 having multiple areas is crystallized. The Plate #2 plays a role of a sample-loading plate to place each extracted glycans for the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The pre-deposited area of the above Plate #2 can be an array of spots such as circles or squares, which are shaped by grooves for holding the sample or matrix within the designated spots. The plate can be made of stainless steel, and the shapes of the area are not limited to certain figures. The areas in the Plate #2 can be arrayed with a regular pattern, which can handle many different samples at the same time. The number of areas in the Plate #2 can be the same number of areas in the Plate #1, or can be different. As a good example of the Plate #2, the number of areas can be more or the same number as the areas in the Plate #1.",
                        "As one example, the Plate #1 can be a plate having 96 wells, and the Plate #2 can have 384 individual areas for the loading of glycans and matrix. FIG. 5 shows the moment of depositing a solution of the sample onto one spot of the Plate #2 which has 384 spots in an embodiment. However, the actual number of sample loading areas on the Plate #2 could be different from 384 of the above example, and could also be identical to or smaller than the number of wells on the Plate #1.",
                        "The surface of the Plate #2 can be metal such as aluminum, stainless steel, a copper alloy, galvanized iron, a gold film, or a silver film. But the plate is not limited only to these materials.",
                        "As a good example, the Plate #2 can be a so-called micro-focus self-condensing plate whose surface was already treated with some special chemicals for inducing highly condensed deposition of the sample solution onto each spot owing to hydrophilic-hydrophobic repulsive surface tension. In addition, the plate can be a pre-spotted micro-focus plate of which self-focusing spots are already coated with a matrix such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (generally called DHB) in order to analyze the glycans more effectively. U.S. Pat. No. 7,619,215 explains the invention of the micro-focus plate in detail.",
                        "In another aspect, the present invention is characterized by using the plate which has each spot pre-coated with the matrix material for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry before applying the sample solution onto the spot. This pre-spotting of the matrix prior to the loading of glycan samples maximizes the sensitivity and reproducibility of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Therefore, the Plate #2 in the present invention can be provided as a plate of which areas for the glycan sample are already coated with the matrix by a spraying machine before loading the glycan solution.",
                        "In a more desirable embodiment, the coating of sample-loading areas with the matrix on the Plate #2 can be performed on top of a heating plate at temperatures between 40\u00b0 C. and 55\u00b0 C. for rapid and uniform crystallization of the matrix. This coating process is repeated several times to deposit at least a certain amount of matrix on each area.",
                        "In an exemplary embodiment, a matrix in an ethanol solution can be sprayed two times or up to 10 times, in order to spread the matrix more evenly to each sample-loading spot of the Plate #2. In a desirable embodiment, a sample-loading spot on the Plate #2 is sprayed with the matrix solution 4 to 8 times. When the matrix solution is sprayed on the plate, the plate can be heated at around 40\u02dc55\u00b0 C. so that the ethanol solvent in the matrix solution is quickly evaporated from the spot, leading to uniform and dense crystallization of the matrix due to fast drying.",
                        "The step (d) includes the loading of solutions containing one or more glycans extracted from the above step (b) onto the areas of the Plate #2 which were already covered with uniform matrix crystals as described in the previous section.",

The glycans eluted in the 10% and 20% ACN solutions are neutral glycans, which are not easily ionized during the MALDI-TOF analysis process. Therefore, NaCl can be added to induce the ionization of the neutral glycans for the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in a positive mode. On the other hand, the glycans eluted in the 40% ACN after the solid phase extraction are acidic glycans, which can be analyzed in the negative mode of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry without NaCl.",
                        "In an exemplary embodiment, the glycan solution can be reconstituted by introducing pure water (Nanopure\u00ae) into the tube, where total glycans from the 10% or 20% ACN solutions have been completely dried in the previous step. The glycan solution in H2O is mixed with an equal volume of NaCl solution, and the mixture of glycans and NaCl is loaded onto the DHB pre-spotted area of the Plate #2. The size of the area of the Plate #2 can be a circle of a 1700\u02dc2000 \u03bcm diameter. Specifically, the diameter can be 1700 \u03bcm if the Plate #2 is a PFA2317DN0 plate supplied by HST\u00ae.",

Glycans and NaCl are co-crystallized as compactly and homogenously as possible on the spots of the plate. The pressure of the drying chamber in this case can be around 6\u02dc8\u00d710\u22122 torr, and where the temperature is not specified, it is assumed to be room temperature.",
                        "The fast drying process at a reduced pressure, in the present invention, is also considered to accelerate the rate of crystallization of the mixture of glycans and the matrix, and causes a reduction in the size of the crystals while facilitating even distribution of the crystals within the spot.",

More specifically, the peak intensity of an identical glycan ion (identical mass-to-charge ratio) can be compared between the benign ovarian tumor patient group and the borderline ovarian tumor patient group. In other words, by comparing the mass spectra of serum glycans through pattern analysis, a significant difference in peak intensities of glycan mass spectra between different groups such as patients and healthy controls can provide clues to the possible candidate ion peaks to differentiate one group from the other.",
                        "In the next step, the detection frequency of each peak and the intensity of the peak in each spectrum of a certain group of tumor patients are the important parameters of quantitative analysis for further investigation. The average values and the coefficients of variation of the intensity of each peak in the mass spectra can also be compared between different groups of patients to determine the key peaks as the markers to separate the groups of different tumors. By this analysis, the screening standards to differentiate benign ovarian tumor patients from borderline tumor patients can be established. This procedure corresponds to the step (S7) in FIG. 1 to establish the screening standards in the training groups. By this process, a specific group of the peaks are selected as the markers among many peaks in the mass spectra. Finally, the cut-off value of each selected marker to differentiate benign ovarian tumor patients from borderline ovarian patients is determined according to statistical analysis of the intensity variations of those marker peaks in the group of the same tumor patients.",

All the marker peaks from a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum could be analyzed with respect to cut-off values of each peak, and if the tendency of each marker peak toward either tumor groups is summarized from a mass spectra, the total sum of the tendency, as a consequence, can determine whether the spectrum is speculated to belong to the benign ovarian tumor group or to the borderline ovarian tumor group.",
                        "The screening method for cancer patients or the differentiation method for tumor patients demonstrated in the present invention are based on the improved reproducibility and better accuracy of the newly introduced methodologies of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry when compared to conventional procedures. The methods of the present invention present a much higher level of screening accuracy that the traditional ovarian tumor marker CA-125 has never reached before.",
                        "One example of the screening method of the present invention to differentiate the benign ovarian tumor patients from the borderline ovarian tumor patients can consist of the following steps: dividing each group of patients into two different subgroups, one of which is designated as a training set and the other as a blind test set; selecting one or more peaks as biomarkers for the discrimination between the benign ovarian tumor group and the borderline ovarian tumor group, in comprehensive statistical analyses comparing the intensities of ion peaks from the mass spectra between the two groups in the training set; establishing differentiation standards (cut-off values) for each biomarker peak on the basis of the analyses with mass spectra generated from the training set; analyzing the mass spectra from the blind test set with the procedures summarizing the likelihood of each marker peak toward one of the two groups as described previously, in order to independently validate the effectiveness of these screening standards determined by the training set of those two groups; and evaluating the competence of the screening methods based on the quantitative MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the N-linked serum glycans for the discrimination between benign ovarian tumor patients and borderline ovarian tumor patients.",
                        "According to specific examples of the invention, this analysis of serum glycans with highly reproducible MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry could lead to the discovery of new screening markers that are derived from serum glycans and have better specificity and sensitivity than those of conventional ovarian tumor marker CA-125 (cancer antigen 125). By using the Plate #1 having multiple wells with an arrayed pattern, 96 different samples were processed simultaneously. The enzyme reaction to release glycans from the serum proteins was rapidly completed within 10 minutes by continually applying microwave irradiation, while maintaining the reaction temperature constant with the cooling system using the air bubble effect. Otherwise, the reaction would have taken more than 12 hrs (overnight). Further, Plate #2 having multiple spot areas was used to load the glycans for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The background surface as well as the individual areas for sample loading on the Plate #2 was fabricated so that the loaded material was highly condensed within each area. In addition to this surface fabrication, individual sample-loading areas of the Plate #2 were already coated with the matrix that had been sprayed multiple times upon a heating plate for fast drying that was required for very even distribution of the matrix material within each area. These features of the Plate #2, in combination with another rapid drying process for the loaded glycans under reduced pressure, drastically enhanced the homogeneity of co-crystals derived from the glycans and matrix. This uniform co-crystallization of the glycans with the matrix on the Plate #2 eventually led to minimized experimental errors (such as the coefficients of variation or relative standard deviation) in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and made it possible for the statistical analyses of the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data from serum glycans to accurately discriminate different ovarian tumor types. In summary, all the aspects of the present invention described above have streamlined the whole processes from blood to the mass spectrometry of the extracted glycans as one integrated batch procedure with high throughput and reproducibility.",
                        "By introducing several aspects described above to reduce any possible variance during the preparation processes of the serum samples and some improved techniques in the sample loading processes to minimize the data dispersion in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, not only is the reproducibility of the data enhanced, but also the relative standard deviation (in other words, the coefficient of variation) were remarkably reduced.",

The same solution of 32 aliquots from one serum sample which was purified and finally eluted with a 10% ACN solution through the above whole procedures of glycan analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used. Firstly, as the traditional method, the matrix was mixed with the glycan, and then this mixture from each aliquot was applied on 4 different spots of a regular stainless steel plate not having self-focusing function, respectively, and then naturally dried before obtaining MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For a comparison purpose with the above procedure, the same glycan solution finally eluted in a 10% ACN solution was divided into identical 32 aliquots, and then MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the aliquots were obtained from 4 different spots of the Plate #2 for each aliquot. The glycan solution was respectively loaded on the DHB pre-spotted area and then the Plate #2 was immediately dried in a chamber at the reduced pressure before the MALDI-TOF analysis. FIGS. 8a and 8b show the bar graphs of the calculated coefficient of variation (CV; or RSD as relative standard deviation) of the absolute intensities obtained from the mass spectra of the same 32 aliquots. Four measurements of each aliquot were made from different areas, and all the intensities were measured at 1485.53 m/z at which the intensity was observed most distinctively in FIG. 6a, FIG. 7a, and FIG. 7b. In FIG. 8a, all values were calculated from the MALDI-TOF spectrum obtained from the traditional method of the sample loading process. The calculations in FIG. 8b were the same, but the MALDI-TOF spectra were obtained from DHB pre-spotted plate which was quickly dried under the reduced pressure immediately after the glycan sample loading.",

Those spectra obtained by the above \u201cGlycan Profiling Analysis examined by the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with improved reproducibility and its application methods\u201d were carefully examined and compared, then cut-off values for each marker peak were determined on the basis of intensity differences of each glycan peak between the two training groups to differentiate the benign tumors from the borderline tumors. Fifty patients of each group to compose the training set were randomly selected from 169 benign ovarian tumor patients and from 68 borderline ovarian tumor patients, respectively. The remained patients in each tumor type, therefore, 119 patients with benign ovarian tumors and 18 patients with borderline ovarian tumors belonged to the validation set.

On the basis of this standard obtained from this training set, the specificity of the blind test set of the remaining 119 benign ovarian tumor patients was 66.4%, while the sensitivity of the blind test set of the remaining 18 borderline ovarian tumor patients was 88.9%. Meanwhile, the specificity and the sensitivity of CA-125 in the above blind test set were 55.2% and 50.0%, respectively, when the most conventional cut-off value of 35 IU/ml was used.",

Therefore, glycan analysis method shows better screening power than an immunoassay based on the antigen-antibody interaction such as the one using CA-125 for ovarian-related gynecological diseases. In case of sensitivity, the glycan analysis is better than CA-125 by at least 7.9% to a maximum of 38.9%, and in case of specificity, the glycan analysis is better than CA-125 by at least 8.8% to a maximum of 18.1%.",

As schematically shown in FIG. 9, all preparative processes including the separation of sera from 96 individual samples of human blood by using the 96 wells arrayed in the Plate #1 as one batch, it was possible for the following MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to obtain each spectrum of the glycans from each serum within 24 hours.",

Therefore, 768 spectra from one batch of 96 people (96\u00d72\u00d74) are provided, and the intensity values of each peak in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrum are collected and stored in the database. These numbers, thereafter, are compared by the pattern analysis in the reference sets of training groups, such as the groups of borderline ovarian tumor patients and benign ovarian tumor patients, or furthermore, the groups of ovarian cancer patients and healthy people. The pattern analysis of the peak intensities between different groups eventually results in the most accurate cut-off values for each marker peaks of the glycan MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to differentiate one group from the other. With these established cut-off values, it is possible for newly examined test samples of 96 people to be screened for a specific disease within 4 hours once the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of glycans from the new samples have been collected.",
