    "date": "2014-01-01",
    "abstract": "Changes of glycosylation pattern in serum proteins have been linked to various diseases including cancer, suggesting possible development of novel biomarkers based on the glycomic analysis. In this study, N-linked glycans from human serum were quantitatively profiled by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and compared between healthy controls and ovarian cancer patients. A training set consisting of 40 healthy controls and 40 ovarian cancer cases demonstrated an inverse correlation betweenPvalue of ANOVA and area under the curve (AUC) of each candidate biomarker peak from MALDI-TOF MS, providing standards for the classification. A multibiomarker panel composed of 15 MALDI-TOF MS peaks resulted in AUC of 0.89, 80~90% sensitivity, and 70~83% specificity in the training set. The performance of the biomarker panel was validated in a separate blind test set composed of 23 healthy controls and 37 ovarian cancer patients, leading to 81~84% sensitivity and 83% specificity with cut-off values determined by the training set. Sensitivity of CA-125, the most widely used ovarian cancer marker, was 74% in the training set and 78% in the test set, respectively. These results indicate that MALDI-TOF MS-mediated serum N-glycan analysis could provide critical information for the screening of ovarian cancer.",

                "Protein glycosylation is one of the most important posttranslational modifications, resulting in the attachment of glycans (carbohydrate chains) to proteins. Glycans have been reported to be associated with critical functions of proteins and to be involved in many biological processes such as cell signaling, extracellular interactions, infections by pathogens, immune responses, and pathogenesis of cancer [1]. One of the major types of glycans is the N-linked glycans, which are connected to asparagine amino acid residues of proteins, via the amide nitrogen of asparagine [2]. Most of the membrane proteins and secreted proteins are glycosylated by hundreds of glycosyltransferases in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus [3]. N-linked glycans, which could be released from glycoproteins by an enzyme, peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) [4], have been detected in human serum proteins such as immunoglobulins [5].",
                "Alteration of glycosylation patterns in cell lines, sera, or tissue samples from cancer patients has been identified, and numerous kinds of cancer, including prostate, ovarian, breast, and gastric cancer, demonstrated modification in the overall or specific glycosylation patterns [6], indicating that glycans could be employed as useful cancer biomarkers. In addition, most of currently approved cancer biomarkers such as CA-125 or CEA are well known glycoproteins [7, 8], of which quantitative and qualitative changes directly lead to altered patterns of oligosaccharide chains. It is now believed that increased activities of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases or immune responses in cancer patients also contribute to altered glycan patterns in circulation [9]. Therefore, human serum glycome has indeed great potential to provide enormous amount of valuable information regarding carcinogenesis and other pathogenesis.",
                "Recent technical progress provided many valuable tools, in particular mass spectrometry, to study glycomes, the entire profiles of glycans in biological systems, leading to possibilities of disease biomarker development through glycomic analysis [6]. Use of solid phase extraction (SPE) with graphitized carbon cartridges (GCC) successfully isolates oligosaccharides from proteins, salts, and other contaminants after the release of glycans from proteins by PNGase F [10]. Additionally, elution with different concentrations of acetonitrile/H2O significantly increased the isolation efficiency of minor species of glycans in the sample, leading to better quantitative detection of glycans which existed in smaller fraction of total glycan population [11]. These enhanced procedures for the analysis of glycomes eventually enabled mass spectrometry profiling of total glycomes in natural forms without chemical modifications like derivatization, and ion suppression by major glycans was limited to a level where a broad spectrum of glycans could be detected and quantitatively analyzed [12]. These mass spectra of glycans could be employed as multibiomarker panels from which quantitative behavior of each glycan molecules can be traced and compared for the purpose of disease screening. When combined in an optimized manner, these multiple biomarkers usually led to far better diagnostic classifications than single-marker approaches [13]. Furthermore, glycan profiles are far less complicated than proteomic analysis since theoretically ~1600 N-linked glycans were predicted and less than 200 N-glycans are actually detected in the human serum [14], suggesting less number of parameters for the classification analysis and still sufficient amount of information for accurate differentiation of sample sources. Well-curated glycan libraries or databases such as GlycoMod [15] and GlycoSuiteDB [16] are easily available and help correct annotations of glycan ion signals in MALDI-TOF MS spectra, leading to improved characterization of glycomes [14]. With these advantages integrated, a couple of studies regarding correct prediction of cancer patients based on mass spectrometry analysis of human serum glycomes were reported [10, 17], highlighting the promise of better cancer screening with MS-mediated glycomic analysis.",
                "CA-125 is currently the most common tumormarker for ovarian cancer [18], but its use for the detection of ovarian cancer at an early stage is very limited since CA-125 level is elevated only in ~50% of stage I ovarian cancer [19]. Considering that ~19% of ovarian cancer cases are first detected at stage I with 5-year survival rate ~93% and that majority of ovarian cancer patients (67\u201374%) are diagnosed at much later stages (stages III and IV) mostly with metastatic status [20], it is of critical importance to develop biomarkers which can provide reliable information for the early screening of ovarian cancer. CA-125 is mostly used for the monitoring of ovarian cancer after medical treatment.",
                "In this study, we attempted to develop a multibiomarker panel which could classify ovarian cancer patients from healthy controls on the basis of MALDI-TOF MS analysis of human serum N-glycans. N-linked glycans were isolated from patients' sera as well as from healthy controls' sera and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, generating signals from multiple biomarkers containing glycans. These MALDI-TOF MS biomarkers were quantitatively analyzed to discriminate ovarian cancer patients from healthy controls in a training set. Biomarkers were selected on the basis of the correlation between P values of ANOVA and AUC of individual biomarkers, leading to a screening system for the ovarian cancer. We further evaluated this screening system on a blind test set in comparison with the classifications with serum CA-125 levels."

A moderate protein denaturation was carried out with 4 cycles of alternating 15 seconds in boiling water and 15 seconds in a water bath at room temperature, for 2\u2009min in total. N-linked glycans were released from denatured proteins by the addition of 1000 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, New England Biolabs, P0705). The PNGase F reaction was carried out in a microwave-mediated enzyme reaction enhancing system (REDS, HST, SPM0201000) for 10\u2009min at 37\u00b0C with 400\u2009W of microwave power output. Then, ice-cold ethanol (400\u2009\u03bcL) was added, and proteins were precipitated in \u221280\u00b0C freezer for 1\u2009hr. Protein precipitates were removed after centrifugation and the supernatant carrying N-linked glycans was transferred to new tubes and dried in an evaporation system (EZ-2, Genevac). Solid phase extraction (SPE) of N-glycans was performed with graphitized carbon cartridges as described previously [12]. Before loading, cartridges were washed and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 80% acetonitrile/H2O. Glycan solutions were applied to the cartridges that were washed subsequently with Nanopure water. Glycans were eventually eluted in 10% acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O, 20% ACN/H2O, and 40% ACN/H2O with 0.05% TFA, in a sequential manner. Each fraction was collected and fast-dried in an evaporator. Dried glycans were dissolved in 15\u2009\u03bcL of purified water. The acidic glycan fraction (40% ACN/H2O) was not used to discover the biomarkers since biomarkers from 10% and 20% fractions gave analytical information sufficient enough for the development and evaluation of multibiomarker panel for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer temporarily. The 40% fraction will be analyzed with possible modifications such as permethylation in the following studies."

Unknown test set was composed of 23 healthy controls and 37 ovarian cancer patients (Table 5). The age of healthy controls was between 20 and 60, but the 37 ovarian cancer patients were diverse in age from 30 to 89. With different screening threshold scores, sensitivity and specificity for the blind test set were calculated by using 15 biomarkers and the scoring system developed with the training set. The cut-off thresholds for individual biomarker peak was derived with the standard sensitivity of 70% in the training set, and the screening cut-off scores used in the training set were applied to the blind test set to evaluate the predicting capability. The specificity remained constant at 83% with different score thresholds, while sensitivity varied from 81% to 84%, depending on the score thresholds (Table 6). The sensitivity by the serum level of CA-125 in the blind test set was 78%, which was still short of those obtained by the MS peak biomarker panel of this study from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of serum glycans.",
                        "The screening system developed from the training set was applied to another set of ovarian cancer patients who experienced recurrence after initial surgery for the ovarian cancer (see Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/634289). In this recurrent set, all the 8 patients were successfully classified as patients regardless of cell types and stages. Among patients with measurements of the serum CA-125 level in the recurrent cases, only 60% (3 cases) were above the conventional cut-off value 35\u2009U/mL. However, it should be noted that the sample number of recurrent cases was very small (n = 8) to make any valid conclusions about the superiority of biomarkers at this point.",
                        "When the histological types of ovarian cancer were taken into account, clear-cell type ovarian cancer revealed impressive sensitivities from serum glycan MS analysis, better than those from CA-125 by as much as 20% (Supplementary Table 2) in both the training set and blind test set. The serous type of ovarian cancer also demonstrated sensitivities of glycan analysis slightly better or just similar to those from CA-125, implicating that there could be varieties in the classification efficiency due to the types of ovarian cancer as is the case with CA-125. There should be further analysis regarding the relationship between cell types and classification efficiencies since the current set of subjects is relatively small and may be insufficient to determine general tendencies. Mucinous types of ovarian cancer had only 2 cases included in the blind test set and were not included in the analysis of the effect of cell types."

                "In the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of human serum N-glycans, we developed a multibiomarker panel for the screening of ovarian cancer patients and established a screening system based on the biomarker peak intensities showing quantitative differences between cancer patients and healthy controls. The screening system demonstrated classification capability both in the training set itself as well as in the blind test set where the predictive power of the biomarker peaks was evaluated for potential clinical application. When compared with CA-125, the most common ovarian cancer biomarker in the clinical practice, the screening system using MALDI-TOF MS biomarkers resulted in improved performance of classifications both in the training set and in the blind test set.",
                "The correlation between the P values from ANOVA and the AUC (area under the ROC curve) which show the authentic effectiveness of biomarkers was investigated in this study. P values of ANOVA are frequently referred to for the selection of potential biomarkers. It has been expected that P values and AUC are closely associated, but we systematically made a plot showing their relationship in an analytical manner. Moreover, in this study, the diagnostic efficacy was validated in an independent set of 60 blind samples (23 healthy controls and 37 patients) that had been randomly selected. The classification rate was evaluated in this blind test set with biomarkers selected from the training set. To avoid the problem of \u201coverfitting,\u201d this type of cross-validation in the blind test set is essential. In addition, we would like to put an emphasis on the fact that our classification system developed in this study was quite efficient in the identification of recurrent ovarian cancer patients.",
                "In this study, we rather focused on the diagnosis than the marker discovery. Though we followed the protocols that have been previously published, we intended to use every m/z signal which satisfied the following conditions that (i) isotopic peak distribution was apparent; (ii) peaks were observed throughout the samples in a given analytical condition; and (iii) peaks were strong and quantitatively stable enough to distinguish the patients and healthy control groups. Although some of the markers did not match with theoretical mass values of glycans in databases, we insisted to use those peaks because they were consistently detected in almost every sample including the blind test set, and their intensities were stable and reproducible enough to minimize the concerns regarding the quantitative interference by the nonglycan peaks on the overall peak intensities. Regardless of molecular characteristics of biomarkers, we pursued the clinical values of disease markers in order to develop a practical diagnostic system out of mass spectrometric analysis of serum biomolecules.",
                "N-glycans attached on the serum proteins are a diverse source of physiological and pathological information. Their structure and quantity have been reported to reflect the biological condition of the serum's host. The consequence the nature of N-glycan alterations is not completely understood yet. Nevertheless, it is clear that the N-glycan profiles at a certain moment can be an indication of pathogenesis. Biomarkers can be discovered by the comparison of a patient group to a nonpatient group trying to find the signal that can possibly distinguish the two groups. Thus, even though we do not understand the biological context of changes, nor the exact identity of the mass spectrum ions, the mass spectrometric signals that exhibited apparent differences between two groups should be exploited for better screening methods. Five out of 15\u2009MS peak biomarkers in this study were unable to be assigned as N-glycans according to their accurate masses. Interestingly, those unassigned markers were consistently observed throughout the patient and healthy control samples with different intensities. Furthermore, they were shown in the repetitive analysis of training sets as well as in the blind test set, which suggested that those unidentified molecules should be authentic components of human serum. In this prospective, though the nature of unassigned markers was not elucidated, they were included as a part of biomarkers because they were able to distinguish the patient samples.",
                "While the peak intensities from two groups were compared, P values obtained from ANOVA has been used to determine the potential biomarkers due to the simplicity of the method. However, P value itself cannot be a parameter that represents the efficacy of each marker. To search for the effective biomarkers with simple ANOVA, we investigated the correlation between P values and AUC from ROC curve. As shown in Figure 1, log10 (P value) was linearly correlated to the AUC that represents the discriminating potential of the biomarkers. Considering the fact that ANOVA is one of the convenient methods to compare the difference between two groups, the correlation of P values to AUC suggests a tentative threshold for further discovery of biomarker.",
                "The validity of biomarkers was evaluated by the classification rate in the blind test set. Among the 60 blind serum samples that included 23 healthy women and 37 ovarian cancer patients at various stages, we could discriminate patients with 84% of sensitivity and 83% of specificity. There is little variation in the specificity of the blind set along the different score thresholds, suggesting relatively stable range of classification thresholds. Though there were small changes in the sensitivities of serum glycan analysis, it should be noted that the sensitivities derived from serum glycan analysis were always higher than those from CA-125 while maintaining specificity at 83% in the independent validation set. This emphasizes that MALDI-TOF MS analysis of human serum glycans could be developed into highly efficient screening system for ovarian cancer patients. Another possibility of developing an efficient screening system for ovarian cancer would be the combination of the CA-125 measurement with MALDI-TOF MS analysis of serum glycans. We have tested this possibility by combining the MALDI-TOF MS analysis of serum glycans with CA-125 test, and such combination with CA-125 cut-off 35\u2009U/mL significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the results (~15%, data not shown) when a sample was categorized as a patient's sample either by the serum glycan profiling or by CA-125 test. However, due to the small size of the sample set (~41) and the lack of complete information of CA-125 for each subject in the set, it would be premature to make valid conclusions concerning the potential of combining the serum glycan profiling by MALDI-TOF MS with CA-125 test.",
                "Serum glycan analysis based on MALDI-TOF MS also resulted in the complete detection of ovarian cancer patients with recurrence (Supplementary Table 1). If confirmed with more recurrent ovarian cancer patients in a larger cohort, serum glycan analysis may also be used for the monitoring of the ovarian cancer after primary medical treatment or for the prognosis of the disease.",
                "By analyzing the N-glycome of human serum with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we developed a multibiomarker panel consisting of MALDI-TOF MS ion peaks that enabled the screening of ovarian cancer with high accuracy, and a screening system utilizing the intensity differences and weighting factors was also established. The actual screening efficiencies demonstrated in the blind test set indicate that those multiple biomarkers from MALDI-TOF MS of serum N-glycans were useful for the screening of the ovarian cancer patients, particularly at the early stages."
