                        "Photodetection in the shortwave to longwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpins many modern -applications, including industrial, scientific, energy, medical, and defense applications. Detection devices for this band of frequencies rely on separate narrow bandgap semiconductors such as lead salts, single crystalline materials, III-V semiconductors, binary alloys, and the like. Despite the maturity of these technologies, complex manufacturing processes, high costs, and low temperature of operation requirements remain problematic and prohibitive for many applications. Synthetic limitations have restricted the functionality of polymer-based infrared detectors to the near-infrared region (<1.5 \u03bcm).",
                        "Contemporary shortwave infrared (SWIR, \u03bb=1.0 \u03bcm-3.0 \u03bcm) and midwave infrared (MWIR, \u03bb=3.0 \u03bcm-5.0 \u03bcm) detection is accomplished using III-V semiconductors such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs, \u03bb=0.9 \u03bcm 1.7 \u03bcm), indium antimonide (InSb) which, when doped, forms a photodiode sensitive to wavelengths between \u03bb=1.0 \u03bcm-5.0 \u03bcm, and mercury cadmium telluride (MCT, \u03bb=8 \u03bcm-14 \u03bcm). These semiconductors must be cryogenically cooled to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), indium bump-bonded to a readout integrated circuit (ROIC), and fashioned from a single crystal. Salts such as lead selenide (PbSe) and lead sulfide (PbS) are photoconductive SWIR-MWIR detectors that can operate at room temperature or can be cooled. Lead salt detectors are commonly fabricated by precipitation onto the surface of a substrate. Longwave infrared (LWIR, \u03bb=8.0 \u03bcm-14.0 \u03bcm) detection is dominated by mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT), which can function as a photodiode or a photoconductor. It also must be cryogenically cooled and indium bump-bonded to a ROIC.",
                        "Infrared detectors made of InSb and MCT require expensive cryogenic cooling and, because the sensing element must be a single crystal, cannot be fabricated into large areas and are extremely expensive. Imaging devices made from these materials have to be hybridized to the ROIC before incorporation into the detector back end. Lead salts, because they are precipitated by a chemical reaction onto the substrate, have issues with film uniformity, chemical purity, and electronic defects. Current alternatives to contemporary SWIR-LWIR detectors involve complicated and largely impractical optical arrangements. Moreover, bulk heterojunction diodes are fundamentally limited by the absorption spectrum of conjugated polymers, which is often based in the visible (\u03bb=500 nm-780 nm) or near-infrared (\u03bb=780 nm-1000 nm) regions, and they are inherently inefficient."

This configuration forms one pixel. The transmission lines typically run edge-to-edge across the substrate in a straight line. On the terminus of each of the transmission lines proximate the substrate edge is a contact pad with an edge length no smaller than about 1.0 mm. A polymer is spin-coated on top of the transmission lines, coating the transmission lines, gap, pads, and the entire substrate. The polymer is removed from the contact pads, followed by encapsulation of the polymer over the transmission line gap.",

                        "As used herein, the following terms will be understood to have the definitions set forth. \u201cOpen-shell character\u201d generally refers to molecules with diminished intramolecular electron pairing (i.e., unpaired electrons) and characteristic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal and characteristic magnetization signal in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer or any instrument capable of direct magnetization measurement. In other words, \u201copen-shell character\u201d in a material is defined as exhibiting: 1) diradical character (y0) or multiple diradical character (y1,2,3 . . . i); 2) Characteristic electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal, and/or characteristic magnetization signal in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer or any instrument capable of direct magnetization measurement. Values of y1 and EPR signal intensity are dependent on the bandgap, the difference between the singlet and triplet energy levels (\u0394EST) and ultimately dictated by the polymer structure. \u201cBandgap\u201d generally refers to the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). \u201cIntrinsic conductivity\u201d generally refers to the electrical conductivity measured from a pure material without external additives and/or dopants.",
                        "The invention provides the first utilization/examples of infrared photodetection employing donor-acceptor (DA) conjugated polymer active layers with broadband operation throughout the short-, mid-, and long-wavelength infrared regions. The polymers exhibit strongly correlated electronic structures, very narrow bandgaps, long-wavelength absorption, intrinsic electrical conductivity, and solution-processability. The present disclosure generally discloses fabricated separate, monolithic photoconductive detectors that demonstrate blackbody-induced photocurrents between about 4.5 to 65 pA at room temperature, depending on the polymer used and the infrared spectral region, but consistent with the absorption of the polymer. The invention provides a fundamentally new platform for low cost, ambient temperature infrared detection and optoelectronics.",
                        "While most conventional conjugated polymers are closed-shell species accommodating their \u03c0-electrons in bonding orbitals, DA copolymers with quinoidal character, extended \u03c0-systems, and narrow bandgaps demonstrate open-shell electronic structures. As disclosed herein, modular, solution-processed conjugated polymers (CPs) with absorption profiles and optical excitations that span technologically relevant wavelength (\u03bb) ranges spanning the NIR-LWIR region and that fit within current large-area processing paradigms can be readily achieved. Such synthetic control has also resulted in novel physical properties, such as ground state electronic structures that can be manipulated, tunable electrical conductivities higher than those of other neutral organic solids, and unique electronic, optical, transient, spin, thermal, and magnetic phenomena not previously measured in soft-matter (polymer) systems. This discontinuity in the structure and the corresponding dynamics of these materials as the bandgap continues to narrow is a manifestation of increasing electron correlations and, similar to their inorganic counterparts, leads to new emergent properties.",
                        "Narrow bandgaps afforded through extended conjugation are intimately related to the coexistence of nearly degenerate states, which can be tuned through synthetic design. The unique electronic structures and spin correlated phenomena arising from unpaired electron densities offer richer categories of behavior than in closed-shell CPs. For example, these materials exhibit room-temperature conductivities (\u03c3RT) ranging from \u02dc10\u22128-10 S cm\u22121 and controlled spin multiplicities emanating from a high degree of electronic coherence along the \u03c0-conjugated backbone. In these materials, narrow bandgaps increase configurational admixing, while extension of the \u03c0-system promotes topological localization within the macromolecule, diminishing the covalency of the ground state and promoting diradical and even polyradical character. Extensive delocalization further promotes thermodynamic stabilization.",
                        "These results disclosed herein are consistent with the emergence of open-shell DA polymers with strong \u03c0-correlations that drive the formation of diverse electronic states and open opportunities for the development of new (opto)electronic technologies. The present disclosure further demonstrates that open-shell conjugated polymers can achieve appropriate electrical properties, tunable electrical conductivity, and photoresponsivity in their native forms to function within IR photoconductive detectors.",
                        "Photoconductive detectors of the invention were fabricated by spin-coating or oxidative chemical vapor deposition of the polymer(s) onto a substrate pre-patterned with gold electrodes. The electrodes can also be made of any combination of metals and semiconductors that provide a low contact resistance between the electrode material and polymer film. FIG. 1 illustrates five exemplary chemical structures P1-P5 of polymers with open-shell ground states. In other words, P1-P5 may exhibit open-shell ground states, long-wavelength absorption, and intrinsic electrical conductivity. The charge transport in these materials may be associated with the low energetic barrier from narrow bandgap for thermal excitation of free carriers and extensive delocalization. The IR photoconductive polymers are not limited to P1-P5. Additional exemplary structures are disclosed in the previous patents of PCT/US2019/030950 entitled \u201cOpen-Shell Conjugated Polymer Conductors, Composites, and Compositions\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/327,770 entitled \u201cNarrow Band Gap Conjugated Polymers Employing Cross Conjugated Donors Useful in Electronic Devices\u201d, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.",

                        "Referring now to FIGS. 4 and 5, four current-voltage (IV) curves for at least P1 and P2 were recorded: one without a bandpass filter, and one each with a SWIR bandpass filter (\u03bb=1.1-3.0 \u03bcm), a MWIR filter (\u03bc=3-5 \u03bcm) and a LWIR filter (\u03bb=8.0-11 \u03bcm). Clear photocurrents were observed in all four cases. For both polymers P1 (FIG. 4) and P2 (FIG. 5), approximately 40% of the total (unfiltered) photocurrent originated in the SWIR region as expected, around 15% each in the MWIR and LWIR regions, respectively, with the remainder originating in other regions. These detectors were tested using thicknesses of \u02dc100 nm for P1 and P2. For example, the curves for P1 were generated by testing a detector using a thickness of about 76 nm, and the curves for P2 were generated by testing a detector using a thickness of about 102 nm. The optimal film thickness may be dependent on each particular polymer and the wavelength of interest. For example, the film thickness may vary between about 50 nm and 10 \u03bcm. However, it is contemplated that the film thickness may be outside this exemplary range. Referring now to FIG. 6-7, pulsed laser irradiation was used with two different frequencies at a wavelength of about 1550 nm. The frequencies used were about 0.5 Hz and about 1.0 Hz. The generated level photocurrent was recorded from using pulsed laser irradiation to test a P3-based photoconductive detector (FIG. 6), a P4-based photoconductive detector (FIG. 7), and a P5-based photoconductive detector (FIG. 8).",
                        "The performance of the P1-based photodetector was also measured using photocurrent and dark current relative to a thickness of the polymer. As shown in FIG. 9, a P1-based photodetector was tested with an untreated substrate, and the dark current and the photocurrent were recorded in a first graph (a). A P1-based photodetector was tested with a substrate treated by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), and the dark current and the photocurrent were recorded in a second graph (b). Together, the first graph (a) and the second graph (b) illustrate that the performance of a P1-based photodetector can be modulated by different substrate surface treatments as well as different film thicknesses.",
                        "A P1-based IR detector was also used as a touch sensor. The surface temperature of the detector was recorded while a finger is approaching using an infrared camera. The detector was properly biased at 5 V, and an infrared camera was set on the top of the detector. To record the electrical response of the device, a finger with an insulated glove was placed on the bottom of the detector, which was about 1 mm from the channel. FIG. 10 shows a first photo image (a) from the IR camera recording the surface temperature of the detector before the detector was touched by the finger and a second photo image (b) from the IR camera recording the surface temperature of the detector after the detector was touched by the finger. The square of the area 1 region in both the first and second photo images (a, b) represents the actual channel of the device. The color of the surface has been changed to red after introducing the finger.",
                        "FIG. 10 further includes a first graph (c) illustrating the change in temperature with respect to the time while the finger was approaching the detector and a second graph (d) illustrating the change in current with respect to the time while the finger was approaching the detector. It was observed that the surface temperature of the detector was increased by approximately 5\u00b0 C. due to the finger placed about 1 mm away from the device.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 11, an exemplary polymer structure of polythiophene deposited by oxidative chemical vapor deposition is illustrated. D\u2212 represents the dopant counterion. The structure of polythiophene deposited using oxidative chemical vapor deposition (OCVD) consists nominally of a linear polymer chain with oxidized sulfur heteroatoms. Oxidation of the heteroatom occurs during the polymerization process. In the as-deposited film, the reduced oxidant (now an anion) provides a charge balance while at the same time, electrically doping the film. The actual structure of the polymer chain is branched, not linear. Other polymer structures can also be produced, including but not limited to polyaniline, polypyrrole, polyselenophene, poly(ethylenedioxythiophene), and versions of P1-P5 without solubilizing groups.",
                        "The photocurrent IV curve of the polythiophene film was measured. FIG. 12 illustrates a photocurrent IV curve of the polythiophene film excited by a 500\u00b0 C. blackbody radiator. The photocurrent IV curve shows strong photocurrents when the polythiophene film was excited by the 500\u00b0 C. blackbody radiator throughout the infrared region.",
                        "In various examples, a pushbroom-type sensor or an ROIC can be electrically connected to readout circuitry for signal processing. The first stage of signal processing architecture is pulse capture electronics and digital conversion of the analog pulse. The analog pulse or the detector analog signal from the ROIC can be routed through preamplifier circuitry before entering a cascaded amplifier for formatting the signal. This changes the charge produced by the infrared detector to a voltage signal suitable for amplification. The multi-stage or cascaded amplifier can amplify the signal amplitude. When the signal amplitude is suitable for digitization, it can be sent to an \u201cn\u201d bit analog to digital converter (ADC). For example, as illustrated, the \u201cn\u201d may be about 10 to about 12 bits for the ADC output.",
                        "This design approach may provide built-in noise mitigation as a higher number of bits or \u201cn\u201d bits mitigates the quantization noise and the chopping of input signal shifts the response away from the ambient noise to the chopping frequency. FIG. 13 shows notional designs of various possible stages employed in digitization of the detector response.",
                        "After digitization of the detector response, detector response data can be routed into a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for formatting the array response. The data can also be filtered further for a targeted spectral response and multiplexed for sending to a PC or computer-based or computer processor-based device for image synthesis.",
                        "The invention design may be configured to provide development of a custom, reconfigurable architecture for a signal processing subsystem for IR imaging. This architecture can be designed to have a smaller footprint and lower costs than current commercial systems used for IR imaging. The low C-SWAP for this architecture design makes it suitable for attritable and expendable platforms. The concept allows the use of the same subsystem through lab, field, and flight testing and provides a clear path for technology transition. Moreover, it may provide the capability to interface, control, and test the ROIC from multiple ROIC designers.",
