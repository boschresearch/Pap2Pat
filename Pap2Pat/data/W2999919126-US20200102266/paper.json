    "title": "Modulation of brain cation-Cl\u2212 cotransport via the SPAK kinase inhibitor ZT-1a",
    "date": "2020-01-07",
    "abstract": "The SLC12A cation-Cl \u2212 cotransporters (CCC), including NKCC1 and the KCCs, are important determinants of brain ionic homeostasis. SPAK kinase ( STK39 ) is the CCC master regulator, which stimulates NKCC1 ionic influx and inhibits KCC-mediated efflux via phosphorylation at conserved, shared motifs. Upregulation of SPAK-dependent CCC phosphorylation has been implicated in several neurological diseases. Using a scaffold-hybrid strategy, we develop a novel potent and selective SPAK inhibitor, 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (\u201cZT-1a\u201d). ZT-1a inhibits NKCC1 and stimulates KCCs by decreasing their SPAK-dependent phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a decreases inflammation-induced CCC phosphorylation in the choroid plexus and reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypersecretion in a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a reduces ischemia-induced CCC phosphorylation, attenuates cerebral edema, protects against brain damage, and improves outcomes in a model of stroke. These results suggest ZT-1a or related compounds may be effective CCC modulators with therapeutic potential for brain disorders associated with impaired ionic homeostasis.",

                "Regulation of cellular ion transport is critical for brain water homeostasis. Vectorial ion transport across apical and basolateral membranes of the choroid plexus epithelium (CPe), accompanied by transport of water, cotransported1\u20133 or osmotically obligated4\u20137, results in daily cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion of >500 cc/day into brain ventricular spaces. Impaired ionic homeostasis in CPe can result in hydrocephalus (accumulation of excess CSF in the brain ventricles), as in the settings of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and infection1\u20133. Coordinated transmembrane influx and efflux of ions and water is also necessary for cell volume homeostasis in neurons, glia, and blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells. Impaired cell volume regulation following ischemic stroke and other brain injuries can lead to cytotoxic cell swelling, disruption of BBB integrity, and cerebral edema8\u201310. Hydrocephalus requires neurosurgical treatment by permanent, catheter-based CSF shunting, whereas treatment of ischemic stroke may require decompressive hemicraniectomy11. Both of these often morbid procedures have been used for decades with minimal innovation12\u201314. Recent advances in vascular stroke therapy such as clot lysis by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and clot removal by radiologically guided thrombectomy are appropriate for fewer than 8% of ischemic stroke patients15,16. Thus, development of novel pharmacological modulators of brain ion transport is warranted to provide nonsurgical alternatives to current morbid treatments of these neurological disorders with altered volume homeostasis.",
                "The electroneutral cation\u2013Cl\u2212 cotransporters (CCCs) are secondary-active plasmalemmal ion transporters that utilize electrochemically favorable transmembrane gradients of Na+ and/or K+, established by the ouabain-sensitive Na+, K+-ATPase to drive transport of Cl\u2212 (and Na+/K+) into or out of cells. In epithelial cells under most physiological conditions (with the possible exception of choroid plexus), the Na+-driven CCCs NCC, NKCC1, and NKCC2 (\u201cN(KCCs\u201d)17\u201322, function as Cl\u2212 importers, whereas the Na+-independent KCC1\u20134 (\u201cKCCs\u201d)23\u201326 function as Cl\u2212 exporters. These evolutionarily conserved transporters27 are of particular importance in regulation of ion and water homeostasis in mammalian central nervous system (CNS)28,29. The coordinated regulation of CCC function is important for cell volume regulation in most brain cells, preventing excessive cell swelling or shrinkage in response to osmotic or ischemic stress26,30\u201334. The central importance of CCCs to choroid plexus regulation of CSF homeostasis has been recently recognized1,3.",
                "The Ste20-type Ser\u2013Thr protein kinases SPAK (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) are considered master regulators of the CCCs35. SPAK and OSR1 are activated by phosphorylation in the regulatory \u201cT-loop\u201d (SPAK Thr233 and OSR1 Thr185) by one of four WNK [\u201cwith no lysine\u201d (K)] protein kinases17,36. The WNK and SPAK/OSR1 protein kinases drive Cl\u2212 influx by phosphorylation and activation of the Na+-driven CCC members (NCC, NKCC1, and NKCC2)18\u201320 while inhibiting Cl\u2212 efflux by phosphorylation and inactivation of KCC1\u2013425,26. This reciprocal regulation of the Na+- and K+-driven CCCs by WNK\u2013SPAK/OSR1 ensures tight coordination of cellular Cl\u2212 influx and efflux23,37, and is essential for regulation of cell volume and epithelial transport in multiple tissues38.",
                "SPAK-regulated, CCC-mediated ion transport has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple brain pathologies associated with impaired brain ion and water homeostasis. Experimental ischemic cerebral edema is associated with increased phosphorylation of the SPAK/OSR1 T-loop and of NKCC1 (Thr203/Thr207/Thr212) in both neurons and oligodendrocytes39, and in BBB endothelial cells40,41. Mouse germline SPAK knockout significantly reduces ischemia-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation, infarct volume, axonal demyelination, and cerebral edema following ischemic stroke39,42. Choroid plexus NKCC1 is an essential mediator of ion transport in the CSF hypersecretory response that drives development of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus3. The 3.5-fold increase in CSF secretion accompanying the hydrocephalus caused by experimental IVH is associated with upregulated phosphorylation of SPAK/OSR1\u2013NKCC1 at the choroid plexus apical membrane3. Indeed, the choroid plexus is the site of the highest SPAK abundance among all epithelial tissues22. Knockdown of SPAK in the choroid plexus by intracerebroventricular siRNAs reduced CSF secretion rates and reversed post-IVH ventriculomegaly3.",
                "Here, we report our development of a \u201cdual\u201d CCC modulator (NKCC1 inhibitor/KCC activator), 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (\u201cZT-1a\u201d) that potently and selectively inhibits SPAK kinase. ZT-1a-mediated SPAK inhibition led to reduced cellular ion influx and to stimulated Cl\u2212-dependent K+ efflux by simultaneous reduction of the activating phosphorylation of NKCC1 and the inhibitory phosphorylation of the KCCs. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a prevented CSF hypersecretion in a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus by decreasing SPAK-mediated phosphorylation of CCCs in the choroid plexus. Systemic ZT-1a administration after experimental ischemic stroke attenuated cerebral infarction and edema and improved neurological outcomes by decreasing SPAK-mediated phosphorylation of CCCs in brain tissues. These results suggest that inhibition of SPAK kinase is an effective approach in modulating CCCs and has therapeutic potential for brain disorders of cell volume dysregulation."

                        "To identify pharmacological modulators of SPAK kinase, we designed and synthesized a new focused chemical library derived from the previously identified SPAK inhibitors Closantel43, Rafoxanide44, and STOCK1S-1427943 (Fig.\u00a01). This \u201cscaffold-hybrid\u201d strategy, combining pharmacophores from different scaffolds, has previously led to development of highly selective kinase inhibitors45,46. Closantel and Rafoxanide target the C-terminal domain allosteric sites of SPAK and OSR1, rather than their highly conserved ATP-binding pockets, leading to non-ATP-competitive kinase inhibition44. Iterative rounds of medicinal chemistry optimization led to identification of 5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide (\u201cZT-1a\u201d) as a selective SPAK inhibitor (Fig.\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a01).Fig. 1Hybrid design strategy yields the novel SPAK\u2013CCC modulator ZT-1a.Development of a new SPAK inhibitor (ZT-1a) through the combination of pharmacophores of the 2-(4-amino-2-chloro-5-methylphenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)acetonitrile moiety from Closantel and the chloro-substituted 2-hydroxybenzoic acid from STOCK1S-14279 and Rafoxanide.",
                        "We compared the highest-potency salicylic amides selected from the library with Closantel, STOCK1S-14279, and STOCK1S-50699 as SPAK inhibitors in a cellular context. As NKCC1 and KCCs (KCC1\u20134) are phosphosubstrates of SPAK kinase25,26, SPAK activity was monitored as NKCC1 Thr203/207/212 phosphorylation, which is required for cotransporter activation36, and KCC site1/2 phosphorylation (KCC2 Thr906/Thr1007 or KCC3 Thr991/Thr1048), required for cotransporter inhibition25,47 (Fig.\u00a02, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). ZT-1a emerged as the most potent compound, inhibiting phosphorylation of NKCC1 p-Thr203/207/212 by 72\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2% at 1\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a and phosphorylation of KCC sites 1/2 by 65\u201377% at 3\u2009\u00b5M (both n\u2009=\u20094, p\u2009<\u20090.01) in HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Table\u00a01).

                        "We next tested whether ZT-1a mediates kinase inhibition by competing for ATP binding to kinase in a manner similar to that of the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, staurosporine IC50 values increased proportionally with increasing ATP concentrations, in contrast to the unchanged IC50 values of ZT-1a (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03b). These results suggest that ZT-1a inhibits SPAK kinase in a non-ATP-competitive manner. The kinase selectivity of ZT-1a was further assessed using standard radioisotopic enzymatic assays against a panel of 140 recombinant kinases (Dundee profiling, Supplementary Table\u00a02)48. ZT-1a exhibits relatively high kinase selectivity, insofar as 98% of these 140 kinases were not inhibited by >70% by 1\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a as compared with DMSO control. Whereas 1\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a did inhibit GSK-3\u03b2 activity by 60\u2009\u00b1\u20096% compared in vitro with DMSO control, GSK-3\u03b2 Ser9 phosphorylation was not inhibited by 3\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a either in HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b) or in ZT-1a-treated ischemic brain (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c, d)."

In vitro fluorescence polarization studies confirmed a 0.3-\u00b5M binding affinity of the RFXI motif-containing WNK peptide for purified wild-type SPAK protein, an interaction disrupted by STOCK1S-50699 with IC50 of 2.51\u2009\u00b5M (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05).

KCC3 phosphorylation at pThr1048 was reduced 34\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6% in brains from SPAK502A/502A mice (p\u2009<\u20090.01; n\u2009=\u20093; Supplementary Fig.\u00a08a), a model of Gitelman syndrome57. Thus, systemically administered ZT-1a has low efficacy in naive brains, suggesting inefficient ZT-1a transport across the BBB, likely in part reflecting unfavorable ZT-1a pharmacokinetics in naive mice (T1/2\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009h, AUC\u2009=\u20092340\u2009h*ng/mL and %F\u2009=\u20092.2%; Supplementary Table\u00a03)."

IVH-triggered TLR4 signaling stimulates CSF secretion >3.5-fold and causes hydrocephalus by increasing functional expression of pSPAK and pNKCC1 in CPe3.

Flag-tagged KCC1\u20134 were individually expressed in HEK-293 cells. The purified fraction of KCC immunoprecipitated by KCC site-2 phospho-antibody was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with each antibody. As evident from Fig.\u00a04a, each antibody recognized only its respective target, without isoform cross-reactivity. Although immunospecific, none of these antibodies were able to detect endogenous KCCs from rat CPe lysates through direct immunoblot. However, immunoblot of immunoprecipitated fractions demonstrated robust immunoreaction with antibodies targeting KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4, whereas CPe KCC2 abundance remained below the detection limit, consistent with its documented neuron-specific expression pattern63.Fig. 4ZT-1a decreases SPAK\u2013CCC phosphorylation in hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.a Representative immunoblots verify antibody specificity.

The effects of the SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a and the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide (BMT) on cell volume regulation were assessed in primary cortical neurons exposed to hyperosmotic stress (370\u2009mOsm/kg H2O) (Fig.\u00a05a).

However, in the presence of either BMT or ZT-1a, neurons displayed gradual shrinkage with no RVI response, suggesting roles of SPAK\u2013NKCC1 complex in counteracting cell shrinkage. Upon returning to isotonic conditions after hyperosmotic stress, the drug-treated neurons recovered their volume rapidly (Fig.\u00a05b). The similar effects mediated by BMT and ZT-1a treatments suggest that they target the same signaling cascade. The absence of RVI was also observed in human fibroblast cells treated with BMT or ZT-1a (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09).Fig. 5Effects of ZT-1a on cell volume changes in mouse primary cortical neurons.a Representative images of calcein-AM-loaded mouse primary cortical neurons.

                        "Ischemic stroke is associated with significant upregulation of SPAK and NKCC1 phosphorylation in peri-infarct cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum39. Genetic inhibition of either SPAK or NKCC1 decreases ischemic cerebral edema and improves neurological outcomes42,64. We evaluated ZT-1a efficacy in attenuating cerebral infarct and associated cerebral edema in a mouse model of ischemic stroke39,42. First, we examined intrinsic immunofluorescence labeling of serum albumin at 24\u2009h after tMCAO, as an indication of BBB integrity. As shown in Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c, serum-albumin extravasation into brain parenchyma was ~5-fold higher in mice with ischemic stroke than in sham-operated mice (p\u2009<\u20090.05, n\u2009=\u20095\u20136), suggesting that tMCAO/reperfusion induced disruption of BBB integrity in ischemic brains. We then assessed whether ZT-1a penetrates better in ischemic brains due to the leaky BBB. Two hours after ZT-1a administration (5\u2009mg/kg i.p.), plasma ZT-1a levels in ischemic and non-ischemic sham mice were indistinguishable (p\u2009=\u20090.29; n\u2009=\u200910\u201311, Fig.\u00a06e), whereas ZT-1a concentration in both CL and IL hemispheres of ischemic brains was ~1.8-fold higher than that in sham brains (p\u2009=\u20090.006; n\u2009=\u200910\u201311, Fig.\u00a06f). Importantly, ZT-1a administration 3\u2009h post reperfusion decreased infarct volume by ~44% (from 78.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0mm3 in the vehicle-control group to 43.6\u2009\u00b1\u20096.5\u2009mm3, p\u2009<\u20090.01, n\u2009=\u200912, Fig.\u00a07b). Moreover, ZT-1a treatment at either 2.5 or 5\u2009mg/kg reduced cerebral hemispheric swelling by ~36\u201354% as compared with vehicle control (p\u2009<\u20090.01, Fig.\u00a07b). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) within the 24-h post-stroke period was unaffected by ZT-1a (Supplementary Fig.\u00a010a\u2013c). These results confirm that ZT-1a reduces infarct size and ischemic cerebral edema.Fig. 6Ischemic stroke facilitates ZT-1a entrance into the brain.a Anti-serum-albumin-labeled brain sections at 24\u2009h after sham or tMCAO surgery illustrate image collection in the perilesion and contralateral (CL) control areas (white boxes).

DEC and FA maps revealed intact CC and EC tracks in the CL hemisphere (arrows) and injured EC in the IL hemisphere (arrowheads) (Fig.\u00a07d). FA values were significantly reduced in the ipsilateral EC tract of the vehicle-control brains, indicating loss of white matter integrity after stroke.

                "We have applied a \u201cscaffold-hybrid\u201d strategy to discover and characterize a potent and selective inhibitor of SPAK kinase, ZT-1a [5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide]. About 3\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a inhibited stimulatory phosphorylation of SPAK Ser373 and NKCC1 Thr203/Thr207/Thr212, and the inhibitory phosphorylation of the KCCs (e.g., KCC3 Thr991/Thr1048). As shown in cellular 86Rb+ flux assays, ZT-1a inhibited NKCC1 but potently stimulated KCC activity >10-fold. In a model of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a decreased choroid plexus SPAK\u2013CCC phosphorylation and antagonized inflammation-induced CSF hypersecretion. In a model of ischemic stroke, systemic ZT-1a decreased neuronal and glial CCC phosphorylation, reduced infarct size and cerebral edema, and improved neurological outcomes. These results suggest that ZT-1a is an effective SPAK\u2013CCC modulator, with therapeutic potential for treatment of brain disorders associated with impaired cell volume homeostasis.",
                "The traditional strategy of targeting the ATP-binding site of SPAK/OSR1 increases risks of off-target kinase inhibition. The introduction of STOCK1S-50699 and STOCK2S-2601670 has highlighted SPAK inhibitors that target the CCT domain rather than the kinase domain. However, only STOCK1S-50699, but not STOCK2S-26016, suppressed in vitro phosphorylation of SPAK/OSR1 and NKCC1 induced by hypotonic low [Cl\u2212]25. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetics of STOCK1S-50699 are unfavorable (data not shown). The livestock antiparasitic drug, Closantel71, emerged as the first drug candidate for in vivo pharmacological inhibition of SPAK43,44, but is contraindicated in humans due to retinal toxicity72.",
                "The ATP independence of SPAK inhibition by Closantel and STOCK1S-14279 has suggested the possibility of developing inhibitors of WNK signaling by binding to constitutively active or WNK-insensitive (T233E) SPAK43. With a \u201cscaffold-hybrid\u201d strategy45,46, we designed and synthesized a new, focused chemical library derived from these two ATP-insensitive inhibitors. ZT-1a was among the best SPAK inhibitors identified from an ~300-compound chemical library, and was characterized by fluorescence polarization, in vitro kinase, and cell-based assays. ZT-1a was a more potent CCC inhibitor than its predecessor SPAK inhibitors, Closantel43, Rafoxanide44, STOCK1S-1427943, and STOCK1S-5069970. About 3\u2009\u00b5M ZT-1a substantially inhibited phosphorylation of SPAK Ser373, NKCC1 Thr203/207/212, and KCC3 Thr991/Thr1048 (KCC4 Thr926/Thr980) in cells. ZT-1a also effectively inhibited NKCC1 and stimulated KCC3 in standard cellular assays of CCC-mediated 86Rb+ flux.",
                "Post-stroke administration of Closantel in mice reduced ischemic cerebral infarction size and brain swelling in a dose-dependent manner. However, we detected Closantel toxicity in mice at higher doses (~25\u2009mg/kg), consistent with reported adverse effects in humans, including weakness, visual impairment, and blindness72,73. The in vitro nanomolar-potency pan-WNK-kinase inhibitor WNK463 was developed as an antihypertensive drug74. Oral administration of 1\u201310\u2009mg/kg WNK463 reduced blood pressure and regulated body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in normotensive and hypertensive rodent models74. However, 2.5\u2009mg/kg of WNK463 in mice was not neuroprotective, but elicited ataxia and breathing difficulties, as previously reported at 1\u201310\u2009mg/kg doses74. Although the causes of these adverse effects remain unclear, they also discouraged efficacy testing of WNK463 at higher doses.",
                "Post-stroke administration of ZT-1a attenuated stroke-associated infarction and cerebral edema and rapidly improved neurological function in post-ischemic mice, the results corroborated by brain MRI. T2-weighted MRI of ex vivo brains from ZT-1a-treated mice showed smaller lesion volumes and reduced brain atrophy at 7 days post stroke. DTI data analysis revealed that ZT-1a significantly prevented subacute brain white matter injury after ischemic stroke. ZT-1a thus provides neuroprotection, at least in part by directly inhibiting SPAK kinase activity and SPAK-mediated phosphoactivation of NKCC1 and phosphoinactivation of KCC3 in ischemic brains. ZT-1a reduced ischemia-induced elevations of pSPAK and pNKCC1 by 55\u201365%, and elevations of pKCC3 by 30% compared with vehicle-control mice. The ZT-1a-mediated concurrent inhibition of phosphorylation of SPAK and of NKCC1/KCC3 supports our interpretation that ZT-1a exhibits allosteric inhibition of SPAK kinase activity likely through binding to the secondary pocket of the CCT domain, thus preventing SPAK binding and activation by upstream WNK kinases. A similar dual mechanism of WNK\u2013SPAK inhibitor STOCK1S-50669 has been reported in cultured cells44,70.",
                "Plasma half-life of ZT-1a is only ~1.8\u2009h in normal naive mice, and ZT-1a penetration across the healthy BBB is minimal. Ischemic stroke injury disrupts BBB tight junctions as early as 30\u2009min after resumption of perfusion75,76, facilitating brain access for many small-molecule drugs77. We have shown that ischemic stroke caused robust extravasation of serum albumin into brain parenchyma, in parallel with detection of elevated ZT-1a levels in ischemic brain. These findings suggest that ZT-1a more effectively entered ischemic brain parenchyma across a leaky BBB. However, we cannot rule out possible contributions from altered BBB drug transporter pathways and/or reduced ZT-1a extrusion from CNS in the setting of ischemia. Solute carrier (SLC) transporters, such as organic anion-transporting polypeptides (Oatps), may improve drug delivery into the brain, whereas the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (P-glycoprotein) exports drugs across BBB endothelial cells into the blood78,79. As ischemia increases Oatp1a4 protein expression and function in brain microvessels80, this and other SLC proteins of similar expression pattern may contribute to increased ZT-1a transport across BBB into ischemic brains. Whether ZT-1a is a substrate for Oatp1a4 and ABC superfamily remains to be studied. Ischemic stroke-induced disruption of the BBB integrity is also evident in human brains81,82, suggesting that small-molecule neuroprotective drugs, such as ZT-1a, could potentially traverse the leaky BBB into ischemic human brain. We administered the initial dose of ZT-1a 3-h post stroke, a time comparable to the 2.5\u20134.0-h post-stroke treatment windows found effective for the candidate neuroprotective agents, glibenclamide, human albumin, and minocycline83\u201385. Although ZT-1a and the antiparasitic drug Closantel exhibit similar effects in reducing ischemic brain damage, Closantel shows toxicity in mouse and human72,73. In this study, we did not test possible visual system toxicity of ZT-1a. Additional pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies of ZT-1a, especially on the retina, warrant further investigations for future clinical translation.",
                "The CPe secretes ~500\u2009ml/day CSF, a higher per-cell fluid volume than for any other epithelium38. NKCC1 expressed in the apical CPe contributes approximately half of CSF production, though its mechanism remains unclear, in view of its unique apical localization in the CPe compared with its basolateral position in all other epithelia1. Indeed, some have proposed inward NKCC1 flux to be required for apical K+ recycling and continued CSF production86,87, while others have provided evidence for net ion efflux with obligatory water transport directly contributing to CSF production1,3. Nonetheless, in a rat model of hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage causes a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory response in CPe associated with ~3-fold increase in bumetanide-sensitive CSF secretion3. IVH-induced hypersecretion of CSF is mediated by TLR4-dependent activation of SPAK, which binds, phosphorylates, and stimulates NKCC1 at the CPe apical membrane3. Genetic depletion of TLR4 or SPAK normalizes hyperactive CSF secretion rates and reduces post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus symptoms in parallel with reduction of NKCC1 phosphorylation. We have shown here that ICV administration of ZT-1a restores CSF secretion rates to basal levels after IVH, and antagonizes IVH-induced phosphorylation of SPAK, NKCC1, and multiple KCCs in CPe. These data corroborate previous findings1,3, and suggest ZT-1a or related strategies as potential nonsurgical treatment modalities for hydrocephalus. Further work will be required to determine the mechanisms of NKCC1 ion transport at the CPe membrane, and to assess the therapeutic potential of ZT-1a in other preclinical models of hydrocephalus.",
                "In conclusion, we have developed ZT-1a, a novel drug that potently and selectively inhibits SPAK kinase, the master regulator of CCCs. ZT-1a inhibits NKCC1 and stimulates the KCCs by decreasing their regulatory phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a, by decreasing inflammation-induced phosphorylation of CCCs in the choroid plexus, reduces CSF hypersecretion in hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a attenuates cerebral edema, protects against ischemic brain damage, and improves post-ischemic neurological outcomes by reducing ischemia-induced CCC phosphorylation. These results suggest that ZT-1a or related compounds are effective CCC modulators, with therapeutic potential for treatment of disorders of dysregulated brain volume homeostasis."

Male Wistar rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA), age 8 weeks (220\u2013230\u2009g), were anesthetized (60\u2009mg/kg ketamine plus 7.5\u2009mg/kg xylazine, IP) and allowed to breathe room air spontaneously. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) throughout the course of the experiments. PHH was modeled using a modified protocol based on previously described methods91,95. Briefly, the tail artery of an anesthetized rat was aseptically cannulated using a flexible catheter (PE-20) preloaded with heparinized saline. The rat was then mounted in a stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL), a midline scalp incision was made to expose the skull, and a 1-mm burr hole was made using a high-speed drill over the right lateral ventricle (coordinates, x\u2009=\u2009\u22120.8, y\u2009=\u2009\u22121.7\u2009mm relative to bregma). Approximately 200\u2009\u00b5L of blood was drawn from the tail artery catheter and loaded into a 500-\u00b5L syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV), which was mounted to the stereotactic frame. Under stereotactic guidance, 50\u2009\u00b5L of freshly collected autologous blood, free from anticoagulants, was infused into the right lateral ventricle (coordinates, x\u2009=\u2009\u22120.8, y\u2009=\u2009\u22121.7, and z\u2009=\u2009\u22124.5\u2009mm relative to bregma), over the course of 5\u2009min, and the 26-gauge needle was held in place for an additional 20\u2009min to prevent backflow of blood upon needle removal."

                        "Rates of CSF production were measured as previously described91. Briefly, anesthetized rats were mounted in a stereotactic apparatus and a 1.3-mm burr hole was made over the left lateral ventricle (coordinates, x\u2009=\u2009\u20130.8, y\u2009=\u2009+1.7 relative to bregma). Over the right lateral ventricle, an Alzet brain infusion cannula (#1; Durect, Cupertino, CA) was mounted with one spacer to adjust to \u20134.5-mm depth. The cannula was then connected to a 1-mL syringe loaded with either ZT-1a or vehicle solution (see below) via PE-20 catheter tubing to a syringe infusion apparatus (Pump elite 11, Harvard Apparatus). Next, the rat\u2019s head was rotated on the ear bars 90\u00b0, nose down, and the suboccipital muscles were dissected to the cisterna magna to expose the atlanto-occipital ligament. The ligament was punctured and a 23-gauge flexible catheter (PE-20) was advanced 5\u2009mm through the foramen of Magendie to the 4th ventricle. Sterile, molecular-grade mineral oil (100\u2009\u00b5L, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was infused into the 4th ventricle to occlude the aqueduct of Sylvius, thereby creating a closed system of CSF circulation. With the rat in the same position, a glass capillary tube (cat # CV8010-300, borosilicate, OD, 1\u2009mm; ID, 0.8\u2009mm; length, 30\u2009cm; VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, NJ) was advanced through the burr hole into the left lateral ventricle. The total volume (V) of CSF at a given time point was calculated as V(mm3)\u2009=\u2009\u03c0\u2009\u00b7\u2009r2\u2009\u00b7\u2009d, where r is the radius of the capillary tube and d is the distance that CSF traveled within the capillary. The rate of CSF formation (\u00b5L/min) was calculated from the slope of the volume\u2013time relationship. A baseline rate of spontaneous CSF secretion (no drug infusion) was calculated over 30\u2009min prior to drug infusion, and then compared with the calculated rate of CSF formation following 30\u2009min of ZT-1a infusion.",

Under an operating microscope, the left common carotid artery was exposed through a midline incision. Two branches of the external carotid artery (ECA), occipital and superior thyroid arteries, were isolated and coagulated. The ECA was dissected further distally and permanently ligated. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated and carefully separated from the adjacent vagus nerve. A 12-mm length of silicon-coated nylon filament (size 6-0, native diameter 0.11\u2009mm; diameter with coating 0.21 \u00b1 0.02\u2009mm; coating length 5\u20136\u2009mm; Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA) was introduced into the ECA lumen through a puncture. The silk suture around the ECA stump was tightened around the intraluminal nylon suture to prevent bleeding. The nylon suture was then gently advanced from the ECA to the ICA lumen until mild resistance was felt (~9\u2009mm). For reperfusion, the suture was withdrawn 50\u2009min after MCAO to restore blood flow.
