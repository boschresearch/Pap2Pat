                        "Regulation of cellular ion transport is critical for brain water homeostasis. Vectorial ion transport across the apical and basolateral membranes of choroid plexus epithelium (CPe), accompanied by osmotic transport of water, results in daily cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion of >500 cc/day into brain ventricular spaces (Steffensen et al. (2018) Nat Commun 9, 2167). Impaired ionic homeostasis in the CPe can result in hydrocephalus (accumulation of excess CSF in the brain ventricles), as seen in the context of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (Cherian et al. (2004) Brain Pathol 14, 305-311; Strahle et al. (2012) Transl Stroke Res 3, 25-38). Coordinated transmembrane influx and efflux of ions and water is also necessary for cell volume maintenance in neurons and glia. Impaired cell volume homeostasis can result in cytotoxic cell swelling and cerebral edema, as occurs after ischemic stroke (Kahle et al. (2009b) Physiology 24, 257-265; Simard et al. (2007) Lancet Neurol 6, 258-268). Ischemic cerebral edema and hydrocephalus are neurosurgical diseases, which can treated by decompressive hemicraniectomy or permanent, catheter-based CSF shunting, respectively (Stochetti and Maas (2014) The New England journal of medicine 371, 972). However, these morbid operative procedures have been used for decades with minimal further innovation or reduction in failure rates (Wang et al. (1990) Chemotherapy 36, 177-184; Warf et al. (2011) J Neurosurg Pediatr 8, 502-508; Wu et al. (2007) Neurosurgery 61, 557-562; discussion 562-553). Thus, novel pharmacological modulators of brain salt and water homeostasis are urgently needed to provide a non-surgical alternative to current treatments of these neurological disorders.",
                        "The electroneutral cation-Cl\u2212 cotransporters (CCCs) are secondary-active plasmalemmal ion transporters that utilize electrochemically favorable trans-membrane gradients of Na+ and/or K+, established by primary active transport via the ouabain-sensitive Na+,K+-ATPase, to drive the transport of Cl\u2212 (and K+) into or out of cells. The two CCC subtypes include the Cl\u2212-importing, Na+-driven CCCs (NCC, NKCC1, and NKCC2; to be referred to as \u201cN[K]CCs\u201d), and the Cl\u2212-exporting, K+-driven CCCs (KCC1-4; the \u201cKCCs\u201d) (Arroyo et al. (2013) Molecular aspects of medicine 34, 288-298). These evolutionarily conserved transporters are among the most important mediators of ion transport in multicellular organisms (Gama (2005) Physiological reviews 85, 423-493), with particular importance in mammalian CNS regulation of ionic and water homeostasis (Gagnon and Delpire (2013) Nature medicine 19, 1524-1528; Kahle et al. (2008) Nat Clin Pract Neurol 4, 490-503). The coordinated regulation of CCC function is important for cell volume regulation in most brain cells, preventing excessive cell swelling or shrinkage in response to osmotic or ischemic stress (Kahle et al. (2015) Trends Mol Med 21, 513-523; Zhang et al. (2016) Scientific reports 6, 35986). The central importance of CCCs to CSF homeostasis by choroid plexus has been recently recognized (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003; Steffensen et al. (2018) Nat Commun 9, 2167).",
                        "SPAK (SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) are closely related Ste20-type serine-threonine protein kinases considered master regulators of the CCCs (Zhang et al. (2017) Expert Opin Ther Targets 21, 795-804). SPAK and OSR1 are activated by phosphorylation of the regulatory \u201cT-loop\u201d residue (SPAK Thr233 and OSR1 Thr185) by one of the four WNK [\u201cwith no lysine\u201d (K)] protein kinases (Moriguchi et al. (2005) The Journal of biological chemistry 280, 42685-42693; Vitari et al. (2005) The Biochemical journal 391, 17-24). WNKs-SPAK/OSR1 protein kinases drive chloride influx by phosphorylation and activation of the Na+-driven CCC members (NCC, NKCC1, and NKCC2) (Piechotta et al. (2002) The Journal of biological chemistry 277, 50812-50819; Richardson et al. (2008) Journal of cell science 121, 675-684; Richardson et al. (2011) Journal of cell science 124, 789-800) while inhibiting chloride efflux via phosphorylation and inactivation of KCC1-4 (de Los Heros et al. (2014) The Biochemical journal 458, 559-573; Zhang et al. (2016) Scientific reports 6, 35986). This reciprocal regulation of the Na+- and K+-driven CCCs by SPAK/OSR1 ensures that cellular Cl\u2212 influx and efflux is tightly coordinated (Arroyo et al. (2013) Molecular aspects of medicine 34, 288-298; Kahle et al. (2010) Biochimica et biophysica acta 1802, 1150-1158), and is essential for regulation of normal cell volume and epithelial transport in multiple tissues (Damkier et al. (2013) Physiological reviews 93, 1847-1892).",
                        "Recent work has highlighted the importance of SPAK-regulated CCC-mediated ion transport in brain pathologies associated with deranged ionic and brain water homeostasis. Experimental ischemic cerebral edema is associated with up-regulated phosphorylation of the SPAK/OSR1 T-loop and NKCC1 (Thr203/Thr207/Thr212) in both neurons and oligodendrocytes (Begum et al. (2015) Stroke 46, 1956-1965). Mouse germline SPAK knockout significantly reduces ischemia-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation, infarct volume, axonal demyelination, and cerebral edema following ischemic stroke (Begum et al. (2015) Stroke 46, 1956-1965; Zhao et al. (2017) Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism: official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism 37, 550-563). Choroid plexus NKCC1 is an essential mediator of ion transport in the CSF hypersecretory response that drives development of post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003). The 3.5-fold increase in CSF secretion accompanying the hydrocephalus caused by experimental IVH is associated with similarly up-regulated phosphorylation of SPAK/OSR1-NKCC1 at the choroid plexus apical membrane (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003), the site of highest SPAK abundance among all epithelial tissues (Piechotta et al. (2003) The Journal of biological chemistry 278, 52848-52856). Genetic inhibition of choroid plexus SPAK by intracerebroventricular siRNAs normalized CSF secretion rates and reversed post-IVH ventriculomegaly (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003). Despite the importance of CCCs to CNS physiology, successful development of drugs directly targeting CNS CCCs either by inhibiting NKCC1 (Jantzie et al. (2015) Pediatric research 77, 554-562; Kahle and Staley (2008) Neurosurgical focus 25, E22) or activating the KCCs (Gagnon et al. (2013) Cell physiology 304, C693-714) has proven elusive (Cardarelli et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 1394-1396). Thus, there remains a need for compounds that are capable of modulating CCCs via inhibition of NKCC1 and/or activation of KCCs for reducing ischemic cerebral edema and/or stimulated CSF recresion."

For example, a \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side effects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days.

                                "Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Inglod-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon.",
                                "When the disclosed compounds contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms. Unless specifically stated to the contrary, a disclosed compound includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as the specific 50:50 mixture referred to as a racemic mixture. The enantiomers can be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization (see, CRC Handbook of Optical Resolutions via Diastereomeric Salt Formation by David Kozma (CRC Press, 2001)); formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step can liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomers can be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation.",
                                "Designation of a specific absolute configuration at a chiral carbon in a disclosed compound is understood to mean that the designated enantiomeric form of the compounds can be provided in enantiomeric excess (e.e.). Enantiomeric excess, as used herein, is the presence of a particular enantiomer at greater than 50%, for example, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 75%, greater than 80%, greater than 85%, greater than 90%, greater than 95%, greater than 98%, or greater than 99%. In one aspect, the designated enantiomer is substantially free from the other enantiomer. For example, the \u201cR\u201d forms of the compounds can be substantially free from the \u201cS\u201d forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the \u201cS\u201d forms. Conversely, \u201cS\u201d forms of the compounds can be substantially free of \u201cR\u201d forms of the compounds and are, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the \u201cR\u201d forms.",

For example, when there are two chiral carbons, the compound can have up to four optical isomers and two pairs of enantiomers ((S,S)/(R,R) and (R,S)/(S,R)). The pairs of enantiomers (e.g., (S,S)/(R,R)) are mirror image stereoisomers of one another. The stereoisomers that are not mirror-images (e.g., (S,S) and (R,S)) are diastereomers. The diastereoisomeric pairs can be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example chromatography or crystallization and the individual enantiomers within each pair may be separated as described above. Unless otherwise specifically excluded, a disclosed compound includes each diastereoisomer of such compounds and mixtures thereof.",

Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.",

Solvates are usually crystalline solid adducts containing solvent molecules within the crystal structure, in either stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric proportions. In some cases, the solvent used to prepare the solvate is an aqueous solution, and the solvate is then often referred to as a hydrate. The compounds can be present as a hydrate, which can be obtained, for example, by crystallization from a solvent or from aqueous solution. In this connection, one, two, three or any arbitrary number of solvate or water molecules can combine with the compounds according to the invention to form solvates and hydrates.

ZT-1a-mediated SPAK inhibition leads to reduced cellular ion influx and stimulated cellular Cl\u2212 extrusion by simultaneous reduction of the activating phosphorylation of NKCC1 and the inhibitory phosphorylation of the KCCs. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a normalizes CSF hypersecretion in hemorrhagic hydrocephalus by decreasing SPAK-mediated phosphorylation of NKCC1 and KCC4 in choroid plexus. Systemic ZT-1a administration after experimental ischemic stroke attenuates cerebral infarction and edema and improves neurological outcomes. Without wishing to be bound by theory, these results suggest ZT-1a holds promise as an effective kinase-cotransporter modulator capable of restoring brain water homeostasis and improving neurological function in vivo.",

Sterile, molecular grade mineral oil (100 \u03bcL; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) was infused into the 4th ventricle to occlude the aqueduct of Slyvius, thereby creating a closed system of CSF circulation. With the rat in the same position, a glass capillary tube (cat # CV8010-300; borosilicate; OD, 1 mm; ID, 0.8 mm; length, 30 cm; VitroCom, Mountain Lakes, N.J.) is advanced through the burr hole into the left lateral ventricle. The volume (V) of CSF that forms at a given timepoint is calculated as: V (mm3)=\u03c0\u00b7r2\u00b7d, where r is the radius of the capillary tube and d is the distance CSF traveled within the capillary. The rate of CSF formation (\u03bcL/min) can be calculated from the slope of the volume-time relationship.

(2015) Journal of the American Society of Nephrology: JASN 26, 1525-1536), Rafoxanide (Alamri et al. (2017) ChemMedChem 12, 639-645), and STOCK1S-14279 (Kikuchi et al.

This \u201cscaffold-hybrid\u201d strategy has proven useful for the successful development of kinase inhibitors with high selectivity (Deng et al. (2011) Nature chemical biology 7, 203-205; Deng et al. (2013) Eur J Med Chem 70, 758-767). Closantel and Rafoxanide target the allosteric site on the C-terminal domains of SPAK and OSR1, rather than the highly-conserved ATP-binding pocket of kinases, thereby inhibiting kinase activity in a non-ATP competitive manner (Alamri et al. (2017) ChemMedChem 12, 639-645)). Iterative rounds of medicinal chemistry optimization led to identification of \u201cZT-1a\u201d [5-chloro-N-(5-chloro-4-((4-chlorophenyl)(cyano)methyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide] as a highly selective SPAK inhibitor (Table 1 and FIG. 1A).",

NKCC1 and KCCs (KCC1-4) are phospho-substrates of SPAK kinase (de Los Heros et al. (2014) The Biochemical journal 458, 559-573; Zhang et al. (2016) Scientific reports 6, 35986). SPAK activity was monitored as NKCC1 Thr203/207/212 phosphorylation, required for cotransporter activation (Vitari et al. (2005) The Biochemical journal 391, 17-24), and KCCs sites-1/2 (KCC2 Thr906/1007 or KCC3 Thr991/1048) phosphorylation, required for cotransporter inhibition (de Los Heros et al.

As shown in FIG. 4A, staurosporine IC50 values increased in a dose-proportional manner with increasing ATP concentrations, in contrast to the unchanged ZT-1a IC50 values (FIG. 4B).

In vitro fluorescence polarization studies have confirmed that the RFXI motif-containing WNK peptide binds to purified wild-type SPAK protein with 0.3 \u03bcM binding affinity, an interaction disrupted by STOCK1S-50699 with IC50 2.51 \u03bcM) (FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B). Closantel and ZT-1a did not disrupt binding between WNK4 and the SPAK CCT domain, suggesting the ZT-1a binding site lies outside the CCT domain (FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B). Nonetheless, co-immunoprecipitation of WNK1 with SPAK from HEK293 cell lysates was potently abolished by ZT-1a (FIG. 6).

Low KCC2 activity observed in wild-type (WT) cells was consistent with maximal KCC2 phosphorylation at Thr906/1007 in hypotonic low [Cl\u2212] conditions or isotonic high [K+] (Kahle et al.

ZT-1a activated WT KCC2>2.6-fold (p<0.01; n=3), whereas ZT-1a treatment failed only minimally increased (by 7\u00b12%) activity of KCC2 double mutant Thr906Ala/Thr1007Ala (p>0.05; n=3; FIG. 8).

NCC phosphorylation (pThr46/50/55/60) and NKCC1 phosphorylation (pThr203/207/212) was reduced \u02dc83-90\u00b17.9% in naive WT kidneys 30 minutes after ZT-1a administration (50 mg/kg; p<0.01 n=3; FIG. 9B).

KCC2 Leu502 is a residue required for high affinity recognition of the RFXI motif in SPAK upstream activator WNKs, as well as in its substrates NCC and KCC2/4 (Villa et al.

It was hypothesized that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ZT-1a, bypassing the BBB, might permit therapeutic efficacy by allowing ZT-1a access to SPAK-NKCC1 in the CPe. The effects of ICV ZT-1a delivery were tested on pSPAK, pNKCC1, pKCC4, in rat choroid plexus in the setting of experimental hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, as described (Karimy et al.

                                "NKCC1 is potently inhibited by the commonly used loop diuretics bumetanide and furosemide. Furosemide has poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and significantly lowers NKCC1 affinity than bumetanide (Donovan et al. (2016) European journal of pharmacology 770, 117-125; Fischer et al. (1998) J Membrane Biol 165, 201-211; Puskarjov et al. (2014) Epilepsia 55, 806-818). Multiple studies in both animal models and humans suggest bumetanide is effective in reducing Cl\u2212 influx and restoring GABAergic inhibition (Dzhala et al. (2010) The Journal of neuroscience: the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience 30, 11745-1176; Kahle et al. (2009) Journal of child neurology 24, 572-576; Liu et al. (2012) Pediatric research 71, 559-565; Mazarati et al. (2009) Epilepsia 50, 2117-2122). However, bumetanide exhibits poor CNS penetration due to its significant binding to serum albumin, and its inhibition of the renal-specific isoform NKCC2 causes potent, use-limiting diuresis, an off-target for treating brain disorders. In addition, bumetanide usage in neonates has raised concerns that altering premature EGABA depolarization by bumetanide may inhibit normal neurodevelopment (Wang and Kriegstein (2011) Cerebral cortex 21, 574-587). Alternatively, studies have demonstrated the potential of KCC2 activators as effective pharmacotherapies for disorders of GABAergic disinhibition (Austin and Delpire (2011) Anesth Analg 113, 1509-1515). CLP257 was reported as a direct KCC2 activator (Gagnon et al. (2013) Cell physiology 304, C693-714); however, these results have recently been challenged (Cardarelli et al.

However, adverse effects in humans at higher doses (\u02dc25 mg/kg), including weakness, visual impairment and blindness (Essabar et al. (2014) Asia Pacific Journal of Medical Toxicology 3, 173-175; Tabatabaei et al. (2016) BMC Ophthalmol 16, 207) deterred further investigation of Closantel in the setting of stroke or hydrocephalus. The pan-WNK-kinase inhibitor WNK463 inhibits all four WNK kinases in the nanomolar range in vitro and was developed as an anti-hypertensive drug (Yamada et al. (2016) Nature chemical biology 12, 896-898). Oral administration of 1-10 mg/kg WNK463 reduced blood pressure and regulated body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in normotensive and hypertensive rodent models (Yamada et al. (2016) Nature chemical biology 12, 896-898). However, WNK463 administered to mice at 2.5 mg/kg dose showed no neuroprotective effects, instead inducing ataxia and breathing difficulties which are similar to the previous report at 1-10 mg/kg doses (Yamada et al. (2016) Nature chemical biology 12, 896-898). The causes for these adverse effects remain unclear, but they, too, discouraged efficacy testing of WNK463 at higher doses.",
                                "Post-stroke administration of ZT-1a attenuated stroke-associated infarction and cerebral edema and rapidly improved neurological function in post-ischemic mice, results corroborated by brain MRI. T2-weighted MRI of ex vivo brains from ZT-1a-treated mice showed smaller lesion volumes, and reduced brain atrophy at 7 days post-stroke. DTI data analysis revealed that ZT-1a significantly reduced subacute brain white matter injury after ischemic stroke. ZT-1a thus provides neuroprotection, at least in part, by directly inhibiting SPAK kinase activity and SPAK-mediated phospho-activation of NKCC1 and inactivation of KCC3 in ischemic brains. ZT-1a reduced ischemia-induced elevations of pSPAK and pNKCC1 by 55-65%, and elevations of pKCC3 by 30% compared to vehicle-control mice. The findings that ZT-1a concurrently inhibited phosphorylation of SPAK, KCC3 and NKCC1 are consistent with this interpretation, i.e., ZT-1a-mediated allosteric inhibition of SPAK kinase activity is likely through binding to the secondary pocket of the CCT domain, preventing SPAK binding and activation by upstream WNK kinases. A similar dual mechanism of WNK-SPAK inhibitor STOCK1S-50669 has been reported in cultured cells (Alamri et al. (2017) ChemMedChem 12, 639-645; Mori et al. (2013) The Biochemical journal 455, 339-345).",
                                "Plasma half-life of ZT-1a is only \u02dc1.8 hrs in normal na\u00efve mice, and ZT-1a apparently fails to penetrate the healthy BBB. However, ZT-1a appeared to more effectively enter the ischemic brain across its leaky BBB in exerting its neuroprotective effects. Ischemic stroke injury increases permeability and disrupts BBB tight junctions as early as at 30 minutes of reperfusion, (Sandoval and Witt (2008) Neurobiol Dis 32, 200-219; Shi et al. (2016) Nat Commun 7, 10523), which facilitates brain access for small molecule drugs (Won et al. (2011) Exp Mol Med 43, 121-128). ZT-1a was administered with the initial dose at 3 hrs post stroke, a time is comparable to effective treatment windows for other potential neuroprotective candidates, such as glibenclamide, human albumin, and minocycline (at 2.5-4.0 hrs post-stroke) (Belayev et al. (2001) Stroke 32, 553-560; Simard et al. (2009) Lancet Neurol 6, 258-268; Yrjanheikki et al. (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96, 13496-13500). ZT-1a is superior to the anti-parasitic drug Closantel and the novel pan-WNK inhibitor WNK463 in reducing ischemic brain damage. Future investigations are needed for examining bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ZT-1a in ischemic brains and optimizing treatment protocols.",
                                "The CPe secretes higher volumes of fluid (CSF) per cell than any other epithelium (500 ml/day). NKCC1 expressed in the apical CPe contributes approximately half of the CSF production via its unusual outward transport direction and its unique ability to directly couple water transport to ion translocation (Steffensen et al. (2018) Nat Commun 9, 2167). In a rat model of hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage causes a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory response in CPe associated with \u02dc3-fold increased bumetanide-sensitive CSF secretion (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003). IVH-induced hypersecretion of CSF is mediated by TLR4-dependent activation of SPAK, which binds, phosphorylates, and stimulates NKCC1 at the CPe apical membrane (Karimy et al. (2017) Nature medicine 23, 997-1003). Genetic depletion of TLR4 or SPAK normalizes hyperactive CSF secretion rates and reduces posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus symptoms by reducing NKCC1 phosphorylation. Here, it was shown that ICV administration of ZT-1a restores CSF secretion rates to basal levels after IVH and antagonizes inflammation-induced phosphorylation of SPAK, NKCC1, and KCC4 in CPe. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this suggests that ZT-1a could be a novel pharmacological treatment for hydrocephalus, currently treatable only by the highly morbid surgical approaches of endoscopy or shunting. Further work will be required to assess the therapeutic potential of ZT-1a in other pre-clinical models of hydrocephalus.",
                                "In sum, the novel drug, ZT-1a, that potently and selectively inhibits SPAK kinase, the master regulator of CCCs, was developed. ZT-1a promotes cellular Cl\u2212 extrusion by simultaneous reduction of SPAK-dependent NKCC1 stimulatory phosphorylation and KCC inhibitory phosphorylation. Intracerebroventricular delivery of ZT-1a, by decreasing inflammation-induced NKCC1/KCC4 phosphorylation in the choroid plexus, normalizes CSF hypersecretion in hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Systemically administered ZT-1a, by reducing ischemia-induced NKCC1/KCC3 phosphorylation, attenuates cerebral edema, protects against brain damage, and improves neurological outcomes after ischemic stroke. Without wishing to be bound by theory, these results suggest ZT-1a is an effective kinase-cotransporter modulator with therapeutic potential for disorders of impaired brain water homeostasis.",

                                "Brain penetration of ZT-1a was examined in normotensive mice after ischemic stroke due to leaky BBB. ZT-1a was administered by a single injection of 5 mg/kg ZT-1a (i.p.) in normotensive sham-control mice or in the mice at 3 hrs after tMCAO. At 2 hrs post-injection, there was no significant difference in the plasma bioavailability of ZT-1a in sham control mice and ischemic stroke mice (p=0.29; n=10-11). However, brain concentrations of ZT-1a were significantly higher (\u02dc1.8-fold; p=0.006; n=10-11) in the stroke mice than that of sham-controls. These studies suggest that ischemic stroke facilitates ZT-1a penetration into brain tissue, probably via the disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB).",
