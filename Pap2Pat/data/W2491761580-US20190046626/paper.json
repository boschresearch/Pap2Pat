    "title": "Recombinant expression of Chlamydia trachomatis major outer membrane protein in E. Coli outer membrane as a substrate for vaccine research",
    "date": "2016-07-27",
    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis is a human pathogen which causes a number of pathologies, including genital tract infections in women that can result in tubal infertility. Prevention of infection and disease control might be achieved through vaccination; however, a safe, efficacious and cost-effective vaccine against C. trachomatis infection remains an unmet medical need. C. trachomatis major outer membrane protein (MOMP), a \u03b2-barrel integral outer membrane protein, is the most abundant antigen in the outer membrane of the bacterium and has been evaluated as a subunit vaccine candidate. Recombinant MOMP (rMOMP) expressed in E. coli cytoplasm forms inclusion bodies and rMOMP extracted from inclusion bodies results in a reduced level of protection compared to the native MOMP in a mouse challenge model.We sought to target the recombinant expression of MOMP to the E. coli outer membrane (OM). Successful surface expression was achieved with codon harmonization, utilization of low copy number vectors and promoters with moderate strength, suitable leader sequences and optimization of cell culture conditions. rMOMP was extracted from E. coli outer membrane, purified, and characterized biophysically. The OM expressed and purified rMOMP is immunogenic in mice and elicits antibodies that react to the native antigen, Chlamydia elementary body (EB).C. trachomatis MOMP was functionally expressed on the surface of E. coli outer membrane. The OM expressed and purified rMOMP elicits antibodies that react to the native antigen, Chlamydia EB, in a mouse immunogenicity model. Surface expression of MOMP could provide useful reagents for vaccine research, and the methodology could serve as a platform to produce other outer membrane proteins recombinantly.",

                "Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium responsible for a number of pathologies. Different strains of C. trachomatis are separated into multiple serovars based on serological differences in the Chlamydia major outer membrane protein (MOMP) [1, 2]. C. trachomatis serovars A, B, Ba, and C are responsible for ocular trachoma which can cause conjunctivitis, conjunctival scarring and corneal scarring. Serovars L1, L2 and L3 are responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, which can cause submucosa and lymph-node invasion, with necrotizing granulomas and fibrosis. Serovars D, Da, E, F, G, H, I, Ia, J, Ja and K are responsible for oculogenital disease which can cause cervicitis, urethritis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal conjunctivitis and infant pneumonia [3, 4]. C. trachomatis infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world and imposes a significant medical and economic burden [5\u20137]. Therefore, a prophylactic vaccine is desirable to prevent C. trachomatis related diseases.",
                "Past vaccine candidates comprised of formalin-inactivated Chlamydia trachomatis were only able to elicit short lived protection [8]. The subunit vaccine approach has been investigated as an alternative. The Chlamydia bacterium exists outside the host cell as a metabolically inactive infectious elementary body (EB) and the Chlamydia MOMP accounts for about 60\u00a0% of the mass of the outer membrane of EBs [9, 10]. Antibodies against MOMP can neutralize infectivity of EBs and T cell epitopes have also been identified in MOMP [11, 12]. Therefore, MOMP has been an attractive subunit vaccine candidate against Chlamydia infection for many researchers [13\u201318]. Native MOMP (nMOMP) antigen isolated from EBs induced a protective immune response to a C. trachomatis genital challenge infection in a mouse model [14, 15]. However, development of a robust, cost-effective commercial manufacturing process based on the use of native MOMP can be challenging. Recombinant expression of a vaccine antigen is an alternative method to purification of native antigen from infected cells, and may be easier to scale-up to a commercial manufacturing level.",
                "Chlamydia MOMPs are part of a larger family of genetically related outer membrane proteins (the OmpA family) that are heat-modifiable, surface exposed porin proteins [19]. OmpA proteins have a structurally similar N-terminal domain that is embedded in the bacterial outer membrane. OmpA proteins have been targeted as vaccine candidates because of their surface exposure, high immunogenicity, and role in the interaction between the bacteria and their host cells. Unlike most outer membrane \u03b2-barrel proteins, MOMP is cysteine rich and was predicted to be a 16 stranded \u03b2-barrel outer membrane protein [20, 21]. Recombinantly expressed MOMP (rMOMP) has been explored as a vaccine candidate. rMOMP expressed without a leader sequence forms inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of E.\u00a0coli and rMOMP extracted from inclusion bodies resulted in a reduced level of protection compared to the native MOMP in a mouse challenge model [22, 23]. This may be due to the extracted and refolded rMOMP not having the correct conformation. Thus as an alternative, an outer membrane (OM) expressed rMOMP may attain the correct conformation and enhance the vaccine efficacy. Previous OM expression of rMOMP in E.\u00a0coli resulted in significant reduction in cell viability [22, 24]. Findley et al. has shown improved surface expression of rMOMP, however did not report immunogenicity of the expressed OM rMOMP in an animal model [25]. In this study, expression of rMOMP in E.\u00a0coli outer membrane was optimized by using a number of strategies including rMOMP gene codon harmonization, utilization of low copy number vectors and promoters with moderate strength, evaluation of leader sequences and optimization of cell culture conditions. rMOMP was extracted, purified and biophysically characterized. We show here that E. coli OM expressed rMOMP possessed \u03b2-barrel structure and elicits serum antibodies that react to the native antigen, Chlamydia elementary body, in a mouse immunogenicity model."

Amino acid sequences consisting of a secretion leader and the mature MOMP protein (Table\u00a01) were codon harmonized [26, 27]. In brief, the codon usage data for Chlamydia (native host) and E. coli (expression host) were obtained from the Codon Usage Database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). For each species, the strain with the most codon usage data available was selected as a representative. The codon usage frequency for both native and expression hosts was then calculated and a reference database was generated. We first identified the amino acid residues for which the rare codons were used in the native host, and the corresponding rare codon in expression host was selected for those residues. For the remaining residues, the codon in the expression host that has the closest frequency to the corresponding codon in the native host was selected, and the harmonized gene sequence for Chlamydia MOMP was then generated. NdeI and XhoI sites were avoided in the sequences for subsequent cloning.Table 1Evaluation of Secretion Leader SequencesSecretion LeaderAmino Acid SequencesrMOMP Surface ExpressionCm-MOMPCtD-MOMPCtE-MOMPNative Cm-MOMPMKKLLKSVLAFAVLGSASSLHA+--Native CtD/CtE-MOMPMKKLLKSVLVFAALGSASSLQAND-- Shigella flexneri (SopA)MKSKFLVLALCVPAIFTTHANDND+ Salmonella enterica (PgtE)MKTHVIAVMIIAVFSESVYANDND+ Yersinia pestis (Pla)MKKSSIVATIITILSGSANANDND+ E.\u00a0coli OmpPMQTKLLAIMLAAPVVFSSQEASANDND+ E.\u00a0coli OmpAMKKTAIAIAVALAGFATVAQA+ND+pectate lyase B of Erwinia carotovora CE (PelB)MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMA+++ ND: Not Determined"

HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Goat anti-mouse IgG, Fc\u03b3 fragment specific; Goat Anti-mouse IgG, Fc\u03b3 Subclass 1 specific; or Goat Anti-mouse IgG, Fc\u03b3 Subclass 2c specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted in 5\u00a0% FBS in PBS at 1:6,000, 1:6,000, or 1:2,000 dilution, respectively. The diluted secondary antibodies were added at 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well, incubated for 1\u00a0h at room temperature and the plates were washed three times with PBS-T followed by three times with PBS. Room temperature BD Opt EIA\u2122 TMB Substrate Reagent Set (BD Biosciences) was mixed and filtered through a 0.22um CA filter unit (Corning), and 100\u00a0\u03bcL was added to each well and incubated for 10\u00a0min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 100\u00a0\u03bcL/well of 2\u00a0M H2SO4 (Fisher Scientific). The optical density (OD) was read at 450\u00a0nm on a SpectraMax\u00ae M5 (Molecular Devices). The cutoff OD for each post-immunization serum was calculated as two times of the OD450 of the corresponding pre-immunization serum. ELISA titers were determined by linearly interpolating between the sequential log dilutions that bracket the cutoff OD, where the dependent variable is the OD response and the independent variable is the log dilution. The resulting dilution is then back transformed to obtain the reported titer. The reported titer is the estimated dilution of serum that results in a response equivalent to the cutoff OD."

                                "To improve recombinant protein expression in a heterologous host, Angov et al. developed an algorithm termed \u201ccodon harmonization\u201d that best approximates codon usage frequencies from the native host and adjusts these for use in the heterologous system [26, 27]. We performed either codon harmonization or standard codon optimization on a recombinant Chlamydia muridarum (Cm) MOMP gene and evaluated outer membrane expression with a whole cell flow cytometry antibody binding assay using in-house generated polyclonal mouse sera against Chlamydia EB. Both codon type genes were expressed in a pET vector expression system and with a MOMP native leader sequence. We observed that codon harmonization resulted in ~2 fold increase in geomean fluorescence intensity (GFI) compared to the standard host codon optimized gene (Fig.\u00a01). Therefore, codon harmonized genes were used in subsequent expression evaluations (data below) to further improve rMOMP OM expression.Fig. 1Effect of codon usage harmonization on rMOMP surface expression level. FACS geometric mean (geomean) fluorescence intensity (GFI) is shown for harmonized or optimized rCm-MOMP genes at T\u2009=\u20090 and T\u2009=\u20094\u00a0h after IPTG induction.

Recombinant C. trachomatis Serovar E (CtE) MOMP with a PelB leader sequence was used in this evaluation. The key elements that could affect the OM expression include promoter strength and vector copy number. We compared vectors with high, medium or low copy numbers, and promoters of high, moderate or titratable strength. We found that either a strong promoter or a high vector copy number limited the surface expression of rMOMP using whole cell flow cytometry antibody binding assay (Table\u00a02). High rMOMP surface expression can only be achieved with a combination of moderate promoter and a low vector copy number (such as pAVE029), suggesting that lower transcription level is preferred. Consistent, rMOMP OM expression can be obtained with a pACYDuet vector when we used a host strain with a controllable RNA polymerase level to reduce the rMOMP mRNA transcription rate.Table 2Evaluation of E. coli expression vectorsVectorPromoter/StrengthInducerOrigin of ReplicationCopy NumberrCtE-MOMP Surface Expression (GFIa) bpAVE029\u03bbPL/ModerateIPTGpAT153(colE1)LowGood (~300)pACYDuet-1T7/TitratableArabinose\u2009+\u2009IPTGp15ALowIntermediate (~120)pET (pETBlue-1 and pET22b)T7/StrongIPTGpUCHighLow\u00a0(~30 or lower)pWSK29T7/T3/StrongIPTGpSC101LowNone (intracellular)pJ831(pUC)T7/TitratableRhamnosepMB1HighNone (intracellular)pJ841(pBR)T7/TitratableRhamnosepMB1MediumNone (intracellular)pJ851(pACYC)T7/TitratableRhamnosep15ALowNone (intracellular) aGFI: geomean fluorescence intensity from whole cell flow cytometry antibody binding assay bpAVE029 is an E. coli RNA polymerase dependent expression vector.

                                "There are several advantages of secretory production of recombinant membrane proteins compared to cytosolic production. The N-terminal amino acid residue of the secreted product can be identical to the natural gene product after cleavage of the signal sequence by a specific signal peptidase. Also, there appears to be much less protease activity in the periplasmic space than in the cytoplasm [29]. In addition, disulfide bonds formation can be facilitated because the periplasmic space provides a more oxidative environment than the cytoplasm [29]. Enhanced OM insertion and prevention of periplasmic space inclusion bodies were investigated. Two amino acids at the C-terminus of CtD-MOMP (C. trachomatis Serovar D) were modified to improve the binding to the E. coli \u03b2-barrel assembly complex protein (BamA), which recognizes its outer membrane protein substrates by a species-specific C-terminal signature motif [30]. However, we did not observe a difference in surface expression levels between the wild type CtD-MOMP and the C-terminus modified CtD-MOMP sequences (unpublished observations). Different secretion leader sequences reported to improve the OM localization of the target protein were investigated by using a whole cell flow cytometry antibody binding assay (Table\u00a01). pAVE029 expression vector was used in this evaluation for Cm-MOMP, CtE-MOMP and CtD-MOMP. Among tested leader sequences, E.\u00a0coli OmpA and OmpP leaders, leader sequences from the omptins (SopA, PgtE, and Pla), and PelB leader all resulted in detectable surface expression of rMOMP. Native Cm-MOMP leader was able to direct the OM expression for Cm-MOMP, however, neither of native CtD- or CtE-MOMP leaders resulted in the surface expression of rMOMP."

We evaluated a variety of cell culture conditions with the pAVE029 expression system, including induction time and temperature, cell density at induction, and cell culture medium (Fig.\u00a02). rCtE-MOMP with a PelB leader sequence was used in this evaluation. We performed induction for 4\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h and 16\u00a0h under four different temperatures: 16\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. We found that 4\u00a0h and 6\u00a0h resulted in comparable rMOMP OM expression levels while no expression was observed following 16\u00a0h induction at any of the temperatures tested (Fig.\u00a02a). Induction for 4 or 6\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 30\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in higher surface expression of rMOMP than 25\u00a0\u00b0C and no detectable surface expression was observed at 16\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig.\u00a02a). We also observed cell fragility at 37\u00a0\u00b0C (but not at 30\u00a0\u00b0C), which was indicated by a decrease in OD590 after induction (Fig.\u00a02b). We performed induction at different cell densities and found that it dramatically impacts the rMOMP surface expression. The highest rMOMP expression was obtained with an induction OD590 of ~0.5, while expression dropped with an induction OD590 of ~0.8, while little or no surface expression of rMOMP was observed with an induction OD590 of 1.2 or higher (Fig.\u00a02c). We evaluated seven cell culture mediums and interestingly, the culture medium used had a large impact on rMOMP OM expression (Fig.\u00a02d). Low levels of rMOMP OM expression were observed with LB medium, 0.2\u00a0% lactose auto induction medium, 2YT medium with 1\u00a0% glucose, and the chemically defined Azura medium. The highest rMOMP OM expression (GFI ~300 to 400 in the whole cell flow cytometry antibody binding assay) was obtained with growth in Cinnabar medium. We obtained very high level of periplasmic rMOMP expression with Progro medium, however, no surface expression was observed. IPTG concentration for induction was also evaluated and comparable rMOMP OM expression was observed with 0.1\u00a0mM to 1\u00a0mM IPTG (unpublished observations). Therefore, all expression studies described here were induced by addition of 0.4\u00a0mM IPTG.Fig. 2Evaluation of expression conditions. rCtE-MOMP with a PelB leader sequence constructed in the pAVE029 vector was evaluated. a Surface expression (FACS GFI) of rCtE-MOMP after different IPTG induction times (T\u2009=\u20090 and T\u2009=\u20094\u00a0h) when expressed at different temperatures (37\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009circles, 30\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009squares, 25\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009triangles, 16\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009downward pointing triangles). b Cell concentration (OD590) at different temperatures (37\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009circles, 30\u00a0\u00b0C\u2009=\u2009squares) after different IPTG induction times (T\u2009=\u20090 and T\u2009=\u20094\u00a0h).

Harvested E.\u00a0coli cells expressing rMOMP were disrupted by microfludization and the membrane fraction containing rMOMP was pelleted by ultra-centrifugation. Washing the membrane fraction with high salt buffer further removed residual soluble cellular proteins. A subsequent wash with a buffer containing 1\u00a0% Triton X-100 detergent removed the bacterial inner membrane and a wash with a buffer containing 3\u00a0% \u03b2-octyl-glucoside detergent removed certain bacterial outer membrane proteins other than recombinant MOMP. A variety of detergents were evaluated for extraction of rMOMP from the outer membrane. We found that sarkosyl (an anionic detergent) was the most efficient, followed by foscholine-14 (a lipid like zwitterionic detergent) and zwittergent 3\u201312. DTT was required for extraction of rMOMP. Sarkosyl extracted rMOMP was further purified by size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography. Purified protein concentration was measured by amino acid analysis and the total yield of purified rMOMP is about ~6\u00a0mg per liter of cell culture (mean from three preparations).",
                        "The purified rCtE-MOMP migrates very similarly to the native CtE-MOMP (nCtE-MOMP) that was purified from Chlamydia EBs on a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.\u00a04a and b). It appears that compared to nMOMP, rMOMP has a slightly higher amount of dimeric and oligomeric forms that are SDS-resistant and independent of disulfide reductants (Fig.\u00a04b). A western blot using antisera generated against outer membrane vesicles from the host E. coli strain without the recombinant MOMP gene showed that the purified rMOMP contained some co-purified E. coli host proteins (Fig.\u00a04c, sample 2), and the purity is estimated to be about ~70\u00a0% as determined by mass spectrometry (unpublished observations). We have attempted to improve the purity of the preparation by using different extraction and purification methods, however, were unable to further remove the co-purified host proteins when the rMOMP protein is expressed without an affinity tag. Complete processing of the PelB leader sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometry (unpublished observations). The endotoxin level in the final purified protein sample is undetectable with an anti-E.coli lipo-oligosaccharide (LPS) antibody on western blot (Fig.\u00a04d, sample 2).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis of purified rCtE-MOMP. a SDS-PAGE; (b) anti-CtE EB mouse sera western blot; (c) anti-E.coli control nOMV (native outer membrane vesicle from E. coli that does not contain recombinant MOMP gene) mouse sera; (d) anti-E.coli LPS monoclonal antibody.

Interestingly, rMOMP appears to have a significant higher mean molar ellipticity as compared to the native MOMP. One possible explanation is that the recombinant and native MOMPs were extracted and purified differently, even though both were exchanged into the same final storage buffer. The co-purified E. coli host proteins might also contribute to the difference observed.Fig. 5Secondary structure analysis of purified rCtE-MOMP with Circular Dichroism Spectrometry.

IFU analyis is more labor intensive, more subjective, and not as high-throughput as qPCR.

                "E. coli has been the most prominent host system for production of recombinant proteins [29, 32]. However, the E.\u00a0coli cytoplasmic expression system does have some drawbacks. It is not suitable for production of certain proteins, for example, proteins containing complex disulfide bonds. Overexpressed proteins are often produced in the form of inclusion bodies, from which biologically active proteins can only be recovered by complicated denaturation and refolding processes that often have a low recovery. Overexpression of membrane proteins adds additional complexity. We applied a variety of techniques, including the adjustment of codon usage bias, evaluation of different promoters and vectors with different copy numbers to regulate the level of gene transcription, evaluation of different leader sequences to guide the secretion and insertion of the target protein into outer membrane, and evaluation of cell culture medium and optimization of cell culture conditions. In this paper, we demonstrated significant improvement for the recombinant expression of Chlamydia MOMP with some of the techniques mentioned above.",
                "Codon usage is a reflection of the relative amounts of cognate aminoacyl tRNAs accessible in the cytoplasm. The synonymous codon usage in all the organisms displays a bias\u2014some codons are used frequently, while others are rarely used. Like others cellular systems, E. coli also shows disparities for synonymous codons where in general major codons are predominantly present in highly expressed genes and rare codon occurs in low level expressed genes. This disproportion of codon frequency preferences becomes highly critical for recombinant expression systems, and can lead to mRNA instability, ribosomal stalling, translation errors or premature translational terminations, and ultimately failure to express recombinant genes by heterologous expression hosts. Reported studies indicated that folding and post-translational modifications for both membrane and soluble proteins are also susceptible to synonymous codon usage [33]. Recent studies have shown that codon harmonization, a methodology that matches the codon usage in the recombinant host closely to the usage in the gene\u2019s native organism including the usage of low abundance rare codons (unlike \u201ccodon optimization\u201d methodology that often excludes rare codons), can significantly improve the yield and solubility of recombinant proteins [26, 27]. Presumably by this codon selection, pauses in the translation process are incorporated which leads to improved protein folding and efficient protein biosynthesis. In this study, we adapted the concept of codon harmonization and demonstrated successful recombinant expression of the Chlamydia MOMP, a cysteine-rich, full-length \u03b2-barrel integral membrane protein.",
                "Outer membrane expression of \u03b2-barrel proteins in gram-negative bacteria is complicated, involving translation, secretion across inner membrane into the periplasmic space in the unfolded state, simultaneous cognate chaperone assisted folding and insertion into the outer membrane via \u03b2-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex [34, 35]. Here, we evaluated different promoters, vectors, leader sequences and cell culture conditions for increased outer membrane rMOMP expression. Our data suggested that the combination of a moderate promoter and a low vector copy number greatly improved rMOMP surface expression. We hypothesized that slower transcription and therefore slower translation is optimal for rMOMP OM expression as it provides ample time to allow the newly synthesized protein to be transported into the periplasmic space, properly fold there and translocate onto the outer membrane, resulting in an increased level of surface expression. We have also evaluated different secretion leader sequences, as the efficiency of protein secretion is affected by the leader sequence, even though many prokaryotic and eukaryotic leader sequences are functionally interchangeable. We found that leader sequences originated from the expression host E. coli, such as OmpA and OmpP, drove higher levels of rMOMP surface expression as compared to the native Chlamydia leader sequences. Surface expression of rMOMP has been associated with toxicity to the host cell [22, 24]. As we need to strike a balance between rMOMP OM expression and the host cell viability, many factors need to be optimized to achieve the best outcome, including optimal cell culture medium, induction of protein expression on or before mid-log phase, and induction at a certain temperature. Our data suggested that the higher surface expression level of a membrane protein such as MOMP can be achieved with a combination of molecular biology and cell culture techniques.",
                "A well-known step along the protein folding pathway that often requires catalysis in vivo is the cis/trans isomerization of prolyl-iminopeptide bonds [36]. Four peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerases (PPIases), SurA, PpiD, FkpA and PpiA, have been described for the isomerization role in periplasm of E.\u00a0coli [37]. We hypothesized that co-expression of these enzymes might improve the efficiency of periplasmic folding of rMOMP and therefore enhance its OM expression level. In addition, proper disulfide bond formation is also presumed to be critical for correct folding of MOMP, a cysteine-rich protein. Both DsbA and DsbC, members of the thioredoxin superfamily, are critical for catalysis of correct disulfide bonds [38]. Another future attempt will be to test the OM expression of rMOMP in an E. coli host strain that overexpresses these oxidoreductases.",
                "Refolded rMOMP from E. coli inclusion bodies resulted in a reduced level of protection compared to the native MOMP in a mouse challenge model, suggesting that correct conformation of MOMP is required for protective immune responses [23]. Consistent with this finding, rMOMP extracted from inclusion bodies and refolded in vitro elicited a significant lower antibody titer against Chlamydia EB (unpublished observations). We showed here that OM expressed rMOMP maintained \u03b2-strand secondary structure as expected and elicited a comparable antibody response in mice that react to the native Chlamydia EB antigen, as compared to the native MOMP. Whether the native tertiary structure is preserved in OM expressed rMOMP remains to be determined, as no molecular structures of either native MOMP or recombinant MOMP are available to date. However, our data suggested that the OM expressed rMOMP at least contains some epitopes in their native forms.",
                "Strains of Chlamydia trachomatis human serovars have been used as the challenge strain in murine genital tract models, even though intravaginal inoculation with human serovars typically results in a mild genital tract infection of short duration and lower bacterial burdens [39, 40]. We used C. trachomatis serovar D as the challenge strain in our mouse immunogenicity model, and demonstrated that immunization with either native or OM expressed rMOMP resulted in similar low levels of post-challenge bacterial burden, consistent with the comparable antibody responses elicited from rMOMP and nMOMP immunizations. A recent study in adaptive immune deficient mice which lack mature T and B cell immunity but maintain functional innate immune effectors showed that C. muridarum infection was unable to be resolved but C. trachomatis infection was spontaneously cleared, suggesting a possibility that innate immunity is sufficient to clear the C. trachomatis infection in mice [41]. Therefore, the comparison of vaccine efficacy between recombinant and native MOMPs needs to be also evaluated in the more stringent C. muridarum mouse challenge model to further confirm the role of adaptive immune response. However, the techniques that we applied to successfully achieve recombinant Chlamydia MOMP outer membrane expression can serve as a platform to produce other outer membrane proteins as vaccines or drug candidates and useful reagents for research, as many of these are membrane proteins."

                "C. trachomatis MOMP is an immunodominant surface protein of crucial importance in the immune response to Chlamydia infection and also a major subunit vaccine target. Recombinant MOMP expressed in E.\u00a0coli cytoplasm forms inclusion bodies and rMOMP extracted from inclusion bodies results in a reduced level of protection compared to the native MOMP in a mouse challenge model. Here we demonstrated successful recombinant expression of MOMP on the E. coli outer membrane achieved with a variety of techniques, including codon harmonization, utilization of low copy number vectors and promoters with moderate strength, suitable leader sequences and optimization of cell culture conditions. The E. coli OM expressed and purified rMOMP is immunogenic in mice and elicits antibodies that react to the native antigen, Chlamydia elementary body. Using C. trachomatis serovar D as the challenge strain in our mouse immunogenicity model, we demonstrated that immunization with either native or OM expressed rMOMP resulted in similar low levels of post-challenge bacterial burden. Surface expression of rMOMP on E. coli OM could provide useful reagents for vaccine research, and the methodology could also serve as a platform to produce other outer membrane proteins."
