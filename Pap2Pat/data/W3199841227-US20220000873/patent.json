                        "The human intestinal barrier covers a surface of about 400 m2 and represents approximately 10% of the body's energy expenditure. The intestinal barrier prevents loss of water and electrolytes from the body and blocks entry of antigens and microorganisms into the body (Brandtzaeg (2011) Eur. J Pharmacol. 668(Suppl 1): S16-S32) while allowing exchange of molecules between the subject and environment and facilitating absorption of nutrients in the diet. Specialized adaptations of the mammalian intestinal mucosa fulfill two seemingly opposing functions: First the intestine appears to be adapted to permit a peaceful co-existence with intestinal symbionts without eliciting chronic inflammation. Second, the intestine provides a measured inflammatory and defensive response to various pathogens (see, e.g., Hooper et al. (2012) Science 336: 1268-1273; Maynard et al. (2012) Nature, 489: 231-241). The intestinal barrier is a complex multilayer system, consisting of an external \u201cphysical\u201d barrier and an inner \u201cfunctional\u201d and \u201cimmunological\u201d barrier. The interaction of these two barriers enables a functional and useful permeability to be maintained (Scaldaferri et al. (2012) J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 46(Suppl): S12-S17).",
                        "There is now increasing evidence that loss of intestinal barrier function can occur either abruptly, e.g. following a major trauma resulting, e.g., in gram-negative sepsis and multi-organ failure (MOF), or gradually leading to chronic inflammatory, and other, diseases.",
                        "Although an apparent link exists between the function of the intestinal barrier and various diseases, the mechanisms are not well understood. For example, we have limited knowledge of what initially causes intestinal barrier dysfunction, and what prevents or restores it. The former might involve different events including, but not limited to, virus infections, reduced perfusion of the mucosa, drugs, or changes in the microbiota (see, e.g., Bischoff (2011) BMC Med. 9: 24). Recent data suggest that intestinal barrier and intestinal microbiota play a role in many different diseases such as idiopathic liver fibrosis or intestinal dysbiosis, the mechanisms of which have been unclear until recently (see, e.g., Tremellen et al. (2012) Med. Hypotheses, 79: 104-112; Seki & Schnabl (2012) J. Physiol. 590: 447-458; Serino et al. (2012) Gut, 61: 543-553; and the like)."

                        "The underlying causes of aging remain elusive, but may include decreased intestinal homeostasis followed by disruption of the intestinal barrier, which can be mimicked by nutrient-rich diets. S3QELs are small-molecule suppressors of site IIIQo electron leak. They suppress superoxide (or hydrogen peroxide) generation at complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain without inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. As described herein, we show that feeding different S3QELs to Drosophila on a high-nutrient diet protects against greater intestinal permeability and apoptotic cell number, and against shorter median lifespan. Feeding S3QELs to mice on a high-fat diet also protects against the diet-induced increase in intestinal permeability. Our results demonstrate that superoxide superoxide (or hydrogen peroxide) produced by complex III in enterocytes is necessary and sufficient to cause diet-induced intestinal barrier disruption in both flies and mice.",

                                "Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a main feature of celiac disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (see, e.g., Brandtzaeg (2011) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 668(Suppl 1): S16-S32; Hering et al. (2012) J. Physiol. 590: 1035-1044; Mankertz et al. (2007) Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 23: 379-383). It has routinely been observed that that increased intestinal permeability precedes clinical manifestations of celiac disease, but is insufficient to cause disease suggesting other factors being involved. Leak flux diarrhea and a facilitated uptake of noxious antigens are two consequences resulting from an impaired epithelial barrier. Barrier perturbations in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprise alterations in epithelial tight junctions, e.g. a reduced number of horizontal tight junction strands and an altered tight junction protein expression and subcellular distribution.",
                                "Additionally, prion protein, a ubiquitous cellular glycoprotein being involved in cell adhesion, was found to be dislocated in IBD supporting the concept that disrupted barrier function contributes to this disorder (see, e.g., Petit et al. (2012) Gastroenterology, 143: 122-132). Increased incidence of apoptotic events, epithelial cell shedding, as well as erosions and ulcerations can also add to that leakiness (see, e.g., Duckworth & Watson (2011) Meth. Mol. Biol. 763: 105-114).",
                                "These barrier defects have been attributed to enhanced activity of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1, INF\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-13, which are frequently highly expressed in the chronically inflamed intestine.",
                                "Although the etiology of IBD is far from being clear, chronic inflammation is believed to result from an inadequate immune response as a consequence of genetic predisposition as well as changes in, and altered responses to the intestinal microbiota. On the other hand, an insufficient mucosal response to bacterial stimuli can result in an insufficient immune response towards intestinal pathogens.",

There is evidence that increased intestinal permeability is related to low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity and pain in IBS (Camilleri et al. (2012) Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 303: G775-G785). In diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), cytoskeleton condensation and enlarged intercellular spaces between epithelial cells have been observed providing the morphological basis for increased intestinal permeability in IBS. These structural changes have been observed to correlate both with mast cell activation and symptoms including diarrhea and pain severity (see, e.g., Mart\u00ednez et al. (2013) Gut, 62: 1160-1168). These data confirm earlier observations derived from Ussing chamber experiments showing increased paracellular permeability in colon tissue of IBS patients (see, e.g., Piche et al. (2009) Gut, 58: 196-201).",

                                "A number of studies on the pathophysiology of obesity and associated metabolic diseases such as NAFLD and NASH, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases, shows that such pathologies are related to the intestinal barrier function and the intestinal microbiota. In particular, it has been shown that metabolic diseases are linked to increased intestinal permeability and translocation of bacteria or bacterial products like endotoxin from the intestine to the liver and to other tissues (see, e.g., Lima et al. (2010) J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 50: 309-315; Kerckhoffs et al. (2010) Dig. Dis. Sci. 55: 716-723; Burcelin et al. (2002) Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 282: E834-E842; Lam et al. (2012) PLoS One, 7: e34233). It has become clear that the microbiota of obese (Ley et al. (2006) Nature, 444: 1022-1023; Turnbaugh et al. (2006) Nature, 444: 1027-1031) and diabetic (see, e.g., Qin et al. (2012) Nature, 490: 55-60) individuals differs from that of the healthy, lean population. In the meantime, evidence is growing suggesting that these alterations are of functional relevance.",

                                "Liver disease is often times associated with increased intestinal permeability. A disruption of the gut barrier allows microbial products and viable bacteria to translocate from the intestinal lumen to extraintestinal organs. The majority of the venous blood from the intestinal tract is drained into the portal circulation, which is part of the dual hepatic blood supply. The liver is therefore the first organ in the body to encounter not only absorbed nutrients, but also gut-derived bacteria and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Chronic exposure to increased levels of PAMPs has been linked to disease progression during early stages and to infectious complications during late stages of liver disease (cirrhosis).",

                                "Not only chronic diseases such as IBD, IBS and metabolic diseases, but also acute intestinal failure and gram-negative sepsis typically observed in the critically ill patient are associated with an impaired intestinal barrier and marked enhancement of intestinal permeability. For that reason, gram-negative sepsis and subsequent multiple organ failure (MOF) is a common cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) (see, e.g., Swank & Deitch (1996) World J. Surg. 20: 411-417). Such complications are seen in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, but also in trauma patients, burn patients and other ICU patients (see, e.g., Derikx et al. (2008) PLoS One, 3: e3954; 238. Derikx et al. (2010) Crit. Care Med. 38: 133-137; de Haan et al. (2009) Crit. Care, 13: R86. Hypo-perfusion of the intestinal tract is regarded as the culprit of such complications. Therefore, such events occur also in patients suffering from acute CVD, acute intestinal ischemia of any cause, and acute enterocyte toxicity, e.g. in the course of chemotherapy (see, e.g., Derikx et al. (2006) J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 28: 267-269; Hanssen et al. (2008) Ann. Surg. 2248: 117-125). Also under physiological conditions, a hypo-perfusion of the gut can happen resulting in gut dysfunction, e.g. in the course of exercise (see, e.g., van Wijck et al. (2011) PLoS One, 6: e22366)."

Recently, it has been recognized that the brain-gut axis interactions are significantly modulated by the gut microbiota via immunological, neuroendocrine, and direct neural mechanisms. Dysregulation of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in PD may be associated with gastrointestinal manifestations frequently preceding motor symptoms, as well as with the pathogenesis of PD itself, supporting the hypothesis that the pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain. Excessive stimulation of the innate immune system resulting from gut dysbiosis and/or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability may induce systemic inflammation, while activation of enteric neurons and enteric glial cells may contribute to the initiation of alpha-synuclein misfolding. Additionally, the adaptive immune system may be disturbed by bacterial proteins cross-reacting with human antigens (see, e.g., Mulak & Bonaz (2015) World J. Gastroenterol. 21(37): 10609-10620).",

The pathways are not clear, but appear to involve lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and other bacterial proinflammatory toxins. Increase in gut permeability cam enable LPS to enter the circulation and thence to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain, where \u03b2-amyloid can trigger AD pathology. It has been observed that blood LPS levels are increased in patients with AD compared with healthy controls. Additionally, aging or disease increases gut permeability so toxins can enter the circulation, and it has been determined that they are in the brain within 15 minutes. Anerobic Gram-negative bacilli in the gut microbiota, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli, secrete the proinflammatory toxins amyloid, endotoxin, LPS, and sncRNA.",

Using a larger size will mimic bigger endogenous macromolecules, although dextran is still an inert test probe. It is important that tested tissue or blood does not have an autofluorescence that interferes with the emission of the fluorescent labeled probe. For example, during cholestatic liver disease, increased bilirubin in the plasma has a similar emission wavelength as fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC)-dextran. Choosing different fluorophores might overcome this problem. We are typically administering 200 \u03bcl of FITC-dextran 4 kD (600 mg/kg body weight) to mice by gavage, and the blood is collected 4 h later. Varying the time after harvesting will depend on which part of the intestinal tract is to be investigated.

Page 1042). The combined administration of a larger and a smaller molecule yields a specific large/small molecule ratio in the urine, which is a reflection of the intestinal permeability and has greater clinical value than the administration of one marker alone (Id.). The most common dual-sugar test in clinical practice is the lactulose-mannitol test (see, e.g., van Elburg et al. (1995) J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 20: 184; Dastych et al. (2008) Dig. Dis. Sci. 53: 2789), however L-rhamnose is sometimes used instead of mannitol (see, e.g., van Nieuwenhoven et al. (1999) Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 29: 160-165; van Wijck et al. (2013) Clin. Nutr. 32: 245-251). Common characteristics of these sugars are that they are passively absorbed from the gut without considerable metabolism and that they are excreted in an unaltered form into the urine in a direct correlation to their absorbed amount from the intestine (see, e.g., Sequeira et al. (2014) PLoS One, 9: e99256). Mannitol is a monosaccharide with a molecular weight (MW) of \u02dc182 Da and demonstrates a transcellular permeation with high appearance in urine after oral application, and a decrease in the presence of villous atrophy as it occurs in celiac disease (see, e.g., Cobden et al. (1978) Br. Med. J. 2: 1060; Juby et al. (1989) Gut, 30: 476-480). Similarly, L-rhamnose, another monosaccharide of \u02dc164 Da, shows a reduced absorption in celiac disease, whereas lactulose is absorbed at an increased rate hence leading to a heightened lactulose/L-rhamnose excretion ratio (see, e.g., Menzies et al. (1979) Lancet, 2: 1107-1109). This is believed to occur since the larger disaccharide lactulose (MW 342 Da) is transported via a paracellular route through the gut wall versus the transcellular route of the aforementioned monosaccharides (see, e.g., Bjarnason et al. (1986) Dig. Dis. 4: 83-92; Maxton et al. (1986) Clin. Sci. 71: 71). In various embodiments, the lactulose-mannitol test involves the simultaneous ingestion of the sugars in water, and, after fasting for, e.g., 2 h, the collection of the urine over, e.g., a 24-hour period. The lactulose/mannitol ratio from the urine collection of the first 6 h can be used to measure the small intestinal permeability (see, e.g., Spiller et al. (2000) Gut, 47: 804-811). In certain embodiments urine collections at 0-3, 3-5, and 5-24 h can be carried out to assess the permeability of the proximal small intestine, distal small intestine, and colon, respectively.",

                                "Measurement of albumin in fecal matter provides one illustrative example of such an assay. Albumin represents approximately 50% of the total protein content in human blood. Albumin is a small globular protein (molecular weight: 66.5 kDa) consisting of a single chain of 585 amino acids, produced by hepatocytes with no or very low intracellular storage (Nicholson et al., 2000; Evans, 2002). Approximately 30% to 40% of the albumin is maintained in the blood stream, while the remainder is distributed in the interstitial space, where its concentration is low (e.g., \u02dc1.4 g/dl). The protein leaves the circulation, returning to it via the lymphatic system.",
                                "Enhanced intestinal capillary permeability increases the release of albumin into the interstitial space. Typically for best accuracy, serum albumin levels need to be normal. Conditions with low serum levels of albumin due to decreased synthesis (e.g., end-stage liver disease) or due to albumin losing diseases (e.g., kidney disease) might result in false negative results. Usually an impermeable macromolecule in the healthy being, isotope-labeled albumin has been used to measure intestinal permeability in disease states. A healthy intestinal epithelial and endothelial barrier prevents the spilling over of albumin into the interstitial space. However, in conditions where the intestinal barrier integrity may be injured, endothelial and epithelial permeability is increased (Iqbal et al. (1996) Gut, 39: 199-203). Thereby, measurement of albumin in fecal samples is a good indicator of a disrupted intestinal barrier. In various illustrative, but non-limiting embodiments, albumin concentrations can be measured in freshly collected stool from mice by a standard ELISA test (Bethyl Lab).",

The effect of zonulin on increased intestinal permeability is mediated through activation of EGF receptor (EGFR) via proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) activation (Tripathi et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 106: 16799). Patients with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which the finely tuned regulation of intestinal tight junctions is lost, have increased serum zonulin levels. Serum zonulin correlates with increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, zonulin upregulation appears to precede the onset of the disease, suggesting the important role of increased intestinal permeability in the pathogenesis of the disease (Sapone et al. (2006) Diabetes, 55: 1443). Other diseases with increased levels of zonulin are celiac disease and obesity (Fasano (2012), supra.).",

                                "Generally, defects or increased permeability of the mucosal barrier will cause intestinal inflammation in response to the enormous number of bacteria present in the bowel. Recruitment of leukocytes into the intestinal wall is important in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Activated neutrophils infiltrate the mucosa and their products can be detected in feces. Numerous neutrophil derived proteins present in stool have been studied, including calprotectin, lactoferrin, and elastase. The most promising marker is calprotectin, because of its remarkable resistance to proteolytic degradation and its stability in stool kept at room temperature for at least seven days (Fagerhol (2000) Lancet, 356: 1783-1784). Calprotectin is a 36-kDa calcium- and zinc-binding protein complex that consists of one light and two heavy polypeptide chains (Dale et al. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 134: 1). It constitutes up to 60% of the cytosolic proteins in human neutrophil granulocytes (Johne et al. (1997) Mol. Pathol. 50: 113), and ileal tissue eosinophils. It is released during cell activation or cell death and has antiproliferative, antimicrobial, and immunomodulating functions (Fagerhol (2000) Lancet, 356: 1783-1784; Lundberg et al. (2005) Nat. Clin. Pract. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2: 96-102). Fecal calprotectin is nowadays used in clinical practice to evaluate disease activity in the follow-up of patients treated for active IBD and can be easily measured (Damms et al. (20-08) Int. J. Colorectal Dis. 23: 985-992).",

                                "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (A1AT) is a protease inhibitor that protects tissues from enzymes of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil elastase. A1AT is one of the principal serum proteins and has a reference range in serum of \u02dc1.5-3.5 g/l, but the concentration can increase to a very high level during acute inflammation. A1AT is highly resistant to proteolysis in the intestine and can be excreted intact in the feces (see, e.g., Sharp (1976) Gastroenterology, 70: 611). A1AT can extravasate from serum into the gut in the condition of increased intestinal permeability, and finally be detected in the feces. This supports fecal A1AT as a biomarker of intestinal permeability. There are commercial kits to measure the fecal A1AT.",

                                "Several studies have successfully used LPS assays to show endotoxemia, mostly in patients with sepsis (see, e.g., Bates et al. (1998) AMCC Sepsis Project Working Group. Clin. Infect. Dis. 27: 582-591). Enhanced levels of LPS were found also in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome (see, e.g., Bergheim et al. (2008) J. Hepatol. 48: 983-992; Thuy et al. (2008) J. Nutr. 138: 1452-1455), which is believed to indicate bacterial translocation from the gut lumen to the circulation as a consequence of intestinal barrier function failure. While LPS can be quite easily measured in portal vein blood in animals, it remains a challenge to measure LPS in peripheral blood in humans and it requires careful standardization of the measurement.",

                                "Measurement of circulating EndoCAb allowing the quantification of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA) against the inner core of endotoxin have been proposed for the acute phase of intestinal barrier damage. This inner core consists of a hydrophobic part, lipid A, which is attached to a core oligosaccharide. Lipid A is highly conserved across the whole range of Gram-negative microbiota. Moreover, it is this part that is considered responsible for endotoxin toxicity. Several studies showed decreased EndoCAb levels postoperatively, accounting for the degree of exposure to endotoxin (see, e.g., Strutz et al. (1999) Intensive Care Med. 25: 435-444; Bennett-Guerrero et al. (2001) J. Cardiothorac. Vasc. Anesth. 15: 451-454). Thus, consumption of these circulating immunoglobulins following translocation of gut-derived endotoxins can be used to acquire indirect information on the intestinal epithelial barrier function.",

Low circulating levels of D-lactate are found in healthy individuals, but in case of intestinal barrier function loss, these levels will rise as a consequence of increased translocation across the intestinal mucosa.",

It has been shown that butyrate decreases bacterial translocation in cells models (see, e.g., Lewis et al. (2010) Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 16: 1138-1148) and modifies the expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-2 in favor of a barrier preservation (see, e.g., Ploger et al. (2012) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1258: 52-59; Wang et al. (2012) Dig. Dis. Sci. 57: 3126-3135). Therefore, butyrate deficiency can be taken as an indirect indicator of impaired intestinal barrier function.",

(2012) Gastroenterology, 143: 698-707) and defensins have been proposed as markers of intestinal permeability. Whereas secretory IgA has been examined in patients with celiac disease, defensins have been analyzed mostly in patients with IBD (see, e.g., Wehkamp et al. (2008) Mucosal Immunol. Suppl 1: S67-S74). More recently, fecal human \u03b2-defensin-2 has been suggested as a marker for intestinal permeability in neonates (see, e.g. Campeotto et al. (2010) Neonatology, 98: 365-369).",

Generally, the base form of the drug is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol and the acid is added thereto. The resulting salt either precipitates or can be brought out of solution by addition of a less polar solvent. Suitable acids for preparing acid addition salts include, but are not limited to both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.

Similarly, for the preparation of salt forms of acidic drugs, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH units higher than the pKa of the drug. This permits the counterion to bring the solution's pH to a level lower than the pHmax to reach the salt plateau, at which the solubility of salt prevails over the solubility of free acid or base. The generalized rule of difference in pKa units of the ionizable group in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the acid or base is meant to make the proton transfer energetically favorable.

                                "In addition to the formulations described previously, the agent(s) described herein may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.",
                                "Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles that may be used to protect and deliver pharmaceutically active compounds. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also can be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various uses of sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.",

In other embodiments, the agents can also be delivered through the skin using conventional transdermal drug delivery systems, e.g., transdermal \u201cpatches\u201d wherein the compound(s) and/or formulations described herein are typically contained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the drug composition is typically contained in a layer, or \u201creservoir,\u201d underlying an upper backing layer. It will be appreciated that the term \u201creservoir\u201d in this context refers to a quantity of \u201cactive ingredient(s)\u201d that is ultimately available for delivery to the surface of the skin. Thus, for example, the \u201creservoir\u201d may include the active ingredient(s) in an adhesive on a backing layer of the patch, or in any of a variety of different matrix formulations known to those of skill in the art. The patch may contain a single reservoir, or it may contain multiple reservoirs.",

Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to, polyethylenes, polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, and the like. Alternatively, the drug-containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this case, may be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it may be a liquid or hydrogel reservoir, or may take some other form. The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper surface of the device, preferably functions as a primary structural element of the \u201cpatch\u201d and provides the device with much of its flexibility. The material selected for the backing layer is preferably substantially impermeable to the active agent(s) and any other materials that are present.",
                                "In certain embodiments, one or more agent(s) described herein can be provided as a \u201cconcentrate\u201d, e.g., in a storage container (e.g., in a premeasured volume) ready for dilution, or in a soluble capsule ready for addition to a volume of water, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other diluent.",

In certain embodiments the agent(s) are administered only once, or for follow-up as required. In certain embodiments the agent(s) are administered once a day, in certain embodiments, administered twice a day, in certain embodiments, administered 3 times/day, and in certain embodiments, administered 4, or 6, or 6 or 7, or 8 times/day.",
                                "In certain embodiments the active agent(s) described herein are formulated in a single oral dosage form containing all active ingredients. Such oral formulations include solid and liquid forms. It is noted that solid formulations typically provide improved stability as compared to liquid formulations and can often afford better patient compliance.",

Non-limiting examples of suitable pH-dependent enteric-coated polymers are: cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, methacrylic acid copolymer, shellac, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, and mixtures of any of the foregoing. A suitable commercially available enteric material, for example, is sold under the trademark EUDRAGIT L 100-55\u00ae. This coating can be spray coated onto a substrate.",
                                "Illustrative non-enteric-coated time-dependent release polymers include, for example, one or more polymers that swell in the stomach via the absorption of water from the gastric fluid, thereby increasing the size of the particles to create thick coating layer. The time-dependent release coating generally possesses erosion and/or diffusion properties that are independent of the pH of the external aqueous medium. Thus, the active ingredient is slowly released from the particles by diffusion or following slow erosion of the particles in the stomach.",
                                "Illustrative non-enteric time-dependent release coatings are for example: film-forming compounds such as cellulosic derivatives, such as methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxyethylcellulose, and/or acrylic polymers including the non-enteric forms of the EUDRAGIT\u00ae brand polymers. Other film-forming materials can be used alone or in combination with each other or with the ones listed above. These other film forming materials generally include, for example, poly(vinylpyrrolidone), Zein, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl acetate), and ethyl cellulose, as well as other pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophilic and hydrophobic film-forming materials. These film-forming materials may be applied to the substrate cores using water as the vehicle or, alternatively, a solvent system. Hydro-alcoholic systems may also be employed to serve as a vehicle for film formation.",

                                "The intestinal epithelium has several barriers, consisting of a mucous layer, tight junctions between cells, and a substantial set of resident immune cells, that protect the host from pathogens and toxins in the gut lumen (Peterson & Artis (2014) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 14:141-153; Vighi et al. (2008) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 153(Suppl 1): 3-6). Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier permits the passage of these pathogens and toxins, which can initiate and exacerbate disease and aging (Fink & Delude (2005) Crit. Care Clin. 21: 177-196; Doig et al. (1998) Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 158: 444-451; Harris et al. (1992) Intensive Care Med. 18: 38-41). Understanding and preventing the underlying causes of intestinal barrier decline can help prevent disease and possibly slow aging (Fasano & Shea-Donohue (2005) Nat. Clin. Pract. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2: 416-422; Farhadi et al. (2003) J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 18: 479-497; K\u00f6nig et al. (2016) Clin. Transl. Gastroenterol. 7: e196; Odenwald & Turner (2017) Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 14: 9-21). Oxidative stress has been argued to be an important driver of aging and age-related pathologies including intestinal barrier dysfunction (Liguori et al. (2018) Clin. Interv. Aging 13: 757-772; Tian et al. (2017) Oxid. Med. Cell. Longev. 2017, U.S. Pat. No. 4,535,194; Hale et al. (2012) PLoS One 7: e41797; Wang et al. (2014) Am. J. Pathol. 184: 2516-2527).",
                                "In the present study we investigated whether mitochondrial superoxide generated by complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain is a cause of intestinal barrier disruption, using Drosophila and mice fed high-nutrient diets as models of accelerated metabolic disease and aging.",
                                "In many species, restricted or ad-libitum feeding impacts both healthspan and lifespan. In Drosophila, decreasing the amount of dietary protein (in the form of yeast extract, YE) below the conventional 2.5% is known to increase median lifespan, whereas increasing dietary YE content decreases median lifespan (Chapman & Partridge (1996) Proc. R. Soc. B Biol. Sci. 263: 755-759). This was confirmed in the two Drosophila strains (w1118 and Canton S) used here (FIG. 6, panels A, B). We measured intestinal permeability of flies by feeding a blue food dye that is normally not absorbed; flies with permeable intestinal epithelium become blue (Rera et al. (2012) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 109: 21528-21533). The percentage of blue flies was higher at greater YE % in both w1118 (FIG. 2, panel A) and Canton S flies (FIG. 6, panel C). Further analysis revealed that median lifespan was decreased in flies of either strain when the incidence of intestinal permeability was enhanced by greater dietary YE % (FIG. 2, panel D), suggesting that intestinal permeability influences lifespan.",
                                "There is a critical balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis in the Drosophila intestine, and tipping this balance can be detrimental (Liang et al. (2017) Nature 548: 588-591). Enterocyte damage can cause apoptosis and therefore trigger proliferation of intestinal cells for repair and maintenance of tissue integrity (Ohlstein & Spradling (2006) Nature 439: 470-474; Amcheslavsky & Ip (2009) Cell Stem Cell 4: 49-61). Feeding higher YE % to w1118 and Canton S flies increased both the number of apoptotic cells and the number of proliferating (PH3 positive) cells per intestine (FIG. 2, panels B, C; FIG. 6, panels D, E), supporting this view. Apoptotic and PH3-positive intestinal cell number correlated negatively with median lifespan (FIG. 2, panels E, F) and positively with intestinal permeability (FIG. 2, panels G, H).",
                                "We confirmed an increase in intestinal permeability using known gene expression hallmarks of a disrupted intestinal barrier. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are expressed in response to intestinal damage and infection, and the Upd3 cytokine is released upon enterocyte damage (Lucchetta & Ohlstein (2012) Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. Dev. Biol. 1: 781-788). The intestinal expression of the AMP genes Dpt, Drs and Def, and the upd3 gene increased at higher YE % on day 10 (FIG. 2, panel I) and day 30 (FIG. 6, panel F) after the diet switch. The intestinal expression of septate junction genes (the equivalent of tight junctions in vertebrates) also increased at higher dietary YE % (FIG. 2, panel J; FIG. 6, panel G). Elevated expression of tight junction genes in flies fed a high-nutrient diet suggests a response to epithelial tight junction damage that is related to an increase in intestinal permeability.",
                                "Next, we investigated the mechanism by which a rich diet decreased median lifespan and increased intestinal permeability. Increased oxidative stress is reported in intestines of animals fed high-nutrient diets (Lee et al. (2017) Diabetes 66: 2072-2081; Paglialunga et al. (2015) Diabetologia 58: 1071-1080; Patel et al. (2007) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 92: 4476-4479; Feillet-Coudray et al. (2014) Free Radic. Res. 48: 1232-1246). We hypothesized that mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species might drive increased intestinal permeability, a suggestion supported by the observation of elevated intestinal gene expression of superoxide dismutases (which dismutate superoxide to hydrogen peroxide) in the cytosol (Sod1) and mitochondria (Sod2), and of catalase (Cat), which reduces hydrogen peroxide to water, in flies fed higher YE % (FIG. 2, panel K).",
                                "The outer ubiquinone-binding site of complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (site IIIQo) has the largest capacity of all mitochondrial sites to produce superoxide, which it delivers into both the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol (Brand (2016) Free Radic. Biol. Med. 100: 14-31; St-Pierre et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277: 44784-44790). To test whether superoxide produced by site IIIQo causes intestinal permeability, flies fed a 5% YE diet were also fed S3QELs, which are small molecules that suppress superoxide production from site IIIQo without affecting energy metabolism (Orr et al. (2015) Nat. Chem. Biol. 11: 834-836). We tested three structurally different S3QELs: S3QEL1.2, S3QEL2.2, and S3QEL3. These act as their own internal control as all three S3QELs should give the same response if their effect is on-target, but different responses if it is off-target.",
                                "FIG. 3, panel A and FIG. 7 show that the incidence of intestinal permeability in w1118 Drosophila fed a 5% YE diet was approximately halved by co-feeding each of the three S3QELs. The S3QELs also decreased the number of apoptotic cells per intestine (FIG. 3, panel B) (FIG. 8, panels A, B show that 8 \u03bcM S3QELs halved apoptotic cell number at both day 10 and day 30), and increased median lifespan by 10-20% (FIG. 3, panel C; FIG. 9). Interestingly, S3QELs had no significant effect on the intestinal incidence of PH3-positive cells (FIG. 8, panels C-F). Further analysis revealed that median lifespan was greater (FIG. 3, panels D-F) and apoptotic cell number was smaller (FIG. 3, panel G) when feeding S3QELs at concentrations greater than 0.08 \u03bcM decreased the incidence of intestinal permeability. These data suggest that by inhibiting superoxide production from site IIIQo, S3QELs decrease intestinal permeability, which in turn increases median lifespan. S3QELs did not decrease food consumption (FIG. 10), ruling out the possibility that they worked by mimicking caloric restriction. In contrast to the effects of S3QELs, feeding of S1QEL1.2 or S1QEL2.1 (suppressors of site IQ electron leak (Brand et al. (2016) Cell Metab. 24: 582-592)) did not protect against induction of intestinal permeability (preliminary data, not shown). Note that both S1QELs and S3QELs suppress superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production by mitochondria isolated from Drosophila (Id.).",
                                "Feeding S3QELs decreased the expression of the intestinal damage and inflammatory gene markers (FIG. 3, panel H), supporting the conclusion of a decrease in intestinal permeability relative to 5% YE diet. Expression of the tight-junction genes did not decrease but trended upwards (FIG. 3, panel I). Feeding S3QELs decreased the expression of the antioxidant genes (FIG. 3, panel J), consistent with a decrease in oxidative stress.",
                                "We investigated whether the effects of S3QELs were exerted specifically within gut enterocytes, which will be more readily exposed to S3QELs from the gut lumen, rather than a systemic effect. Using the NP1-GAL4 driver, we used RNAi to knock down expression of Sod1 and Sod2 specifically in intestinal enterocytes to decrease cytosolic and matrix superoxide removal and thereby increase superoxide levels in the two compartments in these cells. FIG. 4 shows that each knockdown increased the incidence of intestinal permeability and intestinal apoptotic cell number and decreased median lifespan, showing that raised superoxide levels just in enterocytes can drive these phenotypes. After either Sod1 or Sod2 knockdown, S3QELs protected against the induced intestinal permeability (FIG. 4, panels A, C), increase in intestinal apoptotic cell number (FIG. 4, panels B, D) and decrease in median lifespan (FIG. 4, panels E, F). These results support the idea that, by decreasing superoxide production from complex III into the cytosol and matrix, S3QELs can work specifically in enterocytes to decrease superoxide production to improve intestinal homeostasis and extend lifespan.",
                                "To examine whether the effects of S3QELs in Drosophila are conserved, we tested whether they protect against intestinal permeability in a mouse model. To draw parallels to Drosophila, we tested oral delivery of S3QELs in mice fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal). High-fat feeding has been shown to increase oxidative stress and induce intestinal permeability in mice (Ahmad et al. (2017) Sci. Rep. 7: 5125; Murakami et al. (2016) J. Food Sci. 81: H216-H222). We found that high-fat feeding induced intestinal permeability in mice (measured both by the uptake of FITC-dextran from the gut into blood plasma (FIG. 5, panel A) and by the appearance of plasma-derived albumin in feces (FIG. 5, panel B) and decreased the expression of tight-junction (FIG. 5, panel C) and mucin genes (FIG. 5, panel D). It also induced glucose intolerance (FIG. 5, panel E; FIG. 12, panel A), increased body weight and adiposity (FIG. 12, panels B, C) and increased the expression of an ER-stress gene (FIG. 5, panel F).",
                                "S3QEL1.2 and S3QEL2.2 strongly protected against the increases in intestinal permeability in mice (FIG. 5, panels A, B). They protected against the decrease in tight-junction and mucin gene expression in both colon and distal small intestine (FIG. 5, panels C, D; FIG. 11). Expression of the goblet cell differentiation transcription factor Klf4 is known to be decreased upon high-fat feeding, and this decrease is one cause of decreased mucin expression (Gulhane et al. (2016) Sci. Rep. 6: 28990). Klf4 expression was decreased by high-fat feeding and protected by S3QELs (FIG. 5, panel D). Together, these results strongly suggest that superoxide production from mitochondrial complex III drives intestinal permeability in mice as it does in Drosophila.",
                                "Treatment with S3QELs did not improve glucose tolerance in mice fed the high-fat diet (FIG. 5, panel E; FIG. 12, panel A). Weight gain (FIG. 12, panel B), body fat (FIG. 12, panel C) and food consumption (FIG. 12, panel D) of mice fed the high-fat diet each trended downwards with S3QEL feeding, but only the decrease in body fat reached statistical significance. Thaiss and colleagues have proposed that the hyperglycemia induced by a high-fat diet drives intestinal permeability (Thaiss et al. (2018) Science 359: 1376-1383). The lack of significant effect of S3QELs on glucose tolerance despite the improvement in intestinal permeability suggests that hyperglycemia is upstream of intestinal permeability and supports this model (Thaiss et al. (2018) Science 359: 1376-1383) over the alternative model that increased gut permeability drives glucose intolerance. We suggest that high-fat diet and the resulting hyperglycemia increase superoxide production from site IIIQo of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in gut epithelial cells, which in turn drives ER stress, increased intestinal permeability, and other phenotypes. This hypothesis explains why treatment with S3QELs protects against ER stress (FIG. 5, panel F) and intestinal permeability (FIG. 5, panels A, B), but not against impaired glucose tolerance (FIG. 5, panel E; FIG. 12, panel A).",
                                "We conclude that superoxide production from site IIIQo is necessary (and, in flies, raising superoxide levels by Sod knockdown in enterocytes is sufficient) for the development of diet-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction in flies and mice. Suppressing superoxide production by site IIIQo in complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain using S3QELs has potential therapeutic value in intestinal and other diseases of aging.",
