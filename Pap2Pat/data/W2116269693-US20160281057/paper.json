    "title": "Stimulation of human damaged sperm motility with hydrogen molecule",
    "date": "2015-01-01",
    "abstract": "Sperm motility is a critical factor in male fertility. Low motility can be caused by a variety factors including abnormal spermatogenesis, oxidative damage, or depletion of intracellular ATP. Recent findings indicate that hydrogen molecule (H2) selectively reduces toxic reactive oxygen species. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2 on human sperm motility in vitro.Experimentally damaged sperm suspensions from patients left at room temperature for > 5 days or frozen immediately after ejaculation were used. After exposure with H2, their forward motility was measured with a counting chamber. A time-lapse movie was recorded to analyze sperm swimming speed. Mitochondria were stained with a membrane potential-sensitive dye.H2 treatment significantly improved the rate of forward motility, whereas treatment with nitrogen gas did not. While treatment for 30 min was sufficient to improve motility, it did not affect sperm swimming speed. After 24 h, retreatment with H2 increased the motility again. H2 treatment also increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Forward motility of low motile frozen-thawed sperm from patients significantly improved with cleavage medium containing H2.Our results illustrated that H2 treatment stimulates low sperm motility. H2 is a new promising tool for male infertility treatments.",

                "Several factors are present in infertile males with sperm function defects caused by asthenozoospermia [1]. Gene defects, including DNMT3B and MTHFR, have been well documented to correlate with this phenotype [2]. Mitochondria DNA haplogroups may affect sperm motility [3]. Systemic disorders such as polycystic kidney disease [4] also affect fertility and cause asthenozoospermia. Sperms are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress because they contain high concentrations of free unsaturated fatty acids, lack intracellular antioxidant enzymes, and have a limited capacity for DNA repair [5]. The precise mechanisms of motility loss in the sperm, the ability of this cell to fuse with the oocyte under oxidative stress, and the subsequent initiation of lipid peroxidation are not known [6]; however, both oxidative damage to the axoneme and depletion of intracellular ATP appear to be involved [7]. While mitochondria are crucial for ATP production, they are also the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), notably via the formation of superoxide in the electron transport chain. Nevertheless, low levels of ROS are essential and act as second messengers for the regulation of sperm functions [8].",
                "Previous studies have examined the effects of seminal plasma levels or oral administration of zinc, aspartic acid or coenzyme Q10 on semen quality, and their effects in vitro [9-11]. Especially, myoinositol and xanthine derivates have turned out to be an effective tool in stimulation of sperm motility [12,13]. We reported previously that the hydrogen molecule (H2) dose-dependently reduces the hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) in vitro, whereas H2 is too weak to reduce physiologically important ROS such as NO\u2022 and superoxide [14]. H2, the smallest molecule in the universe, has the unique ability of rapidly diffusing across membranes; it can react with cytotoxic \u2022OH in all organelles, including mitochondria and the nucleus, and thus effectively protect cells against oxidative damage. Indeed, H2 prevented a decrease in the cellular levels of ATP synthesized in mitochondria [14]. Many studies reported previously that H2 suppressed oxidative stress-induced injury in several organs, reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain, heart, liver, and retina [14-17], protected against nephrotoxicity [18], and suppressed radiation-induced acute injury in the lung [19]. In the present study, we used experimentally damaged sperm suspensions, and investigated whether H2 treatment exerts protective effects on human sperm. We further demonstrated the practical application of H2 treatment of frozen-thawed sperm from patients."

During experiments, sperm suspensions were kept in approximately atmospheric O2 concentration to enhance oxidative damage. A sperm suspension of 100\u00a0\u03bcL on a culture dish was placed into an exposure chamber (volume, approximately 5\u00a0L) with H2-mixed gases (5% CO2, 20% O2, 50% H2, and 25% N2) or N2-mixed gases (5% CO2, 20% O2, and 75% N2). After closing the exposure chamber tightly, these concentrations of mixed gases (1\u00a0L/min flow rate) were reached within approximately 5\u00a0min. To confirm saturation of the sperm suspensions with mixed gases, we monitored H2 and O2 concentrations with needle-type sensors (Unisense, Aarhus N, Denmark). After exposure to mixed gases, each sperm suspension was mixed well by pipetting and a 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcL drop was placed in a counting chamber [22].

The average of forward motility rate in 35 suspensions was 3.6% [90% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-6.7%]. We then treated the sperm suspensions with mixed gases containing 50% H2 gas (H2-mixed gases) for 40\u00a0min and found that the forward motility rate increased significantly (16.8%, 90% CI: 13.8-19.9%) (Figure\u00a01a). On the other hand, the rate did not change (7.7%, 90% CI: 4.6-10.8%) after the sperm suspensions were treated with N2-mixed gases (without H2 gas). At that time, pH was almost equal between suspensions treated with N2- and H2-mixed gases (pH7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1). Next, we examined the effect of treatment duration using other suspensions with relatively higher motility (n = 12). Both 30 and 60\u00a0min treatments with H2-mixed gas significantly improved sperm motility, whereas the 5\u00a0min treatment did not (Figure\u00a01b), indicating that H2 treatment for 30\u00a0min is sufficient to improve motility.Figure 1 Effect of H 2 treatment on human sperm motility.

We selected other sperm suspensions from 30 patients and examined survival by staining sperm with PI. The average percentage of PI-negative, viable sperm in all suspensions was \\(18.6_{- 18.6}^{+ 35.0}\\%\\) . We then divided them into two groups based on the percentage of viable sperm: high\u2009>\u200920% (n\u2009=\u200917, \\(35.6_{- 12.0}^{+ 20.0}\\%\\) ) and low\u2009<\u200920% (n\u2009=\u200913, \\(3.7_{- 3.7}^{+ 9.3}\\%\\) ). In low-viability group, sperm were immobile before and after treatment with mixed gases. However, we found that H2 treatment stimulated a very sluggish motility of several sperms with pendular movement of their heads around the axis of forward motility in 3 out of 13 suspensions, indicating that almost immobile sperm remaining a weak ability of movement may be activated by H2 treatment. We further investigated the effects of H2 treatment on sperm in high-viability group, in which the average forward motility was 3.0% (90.0% CI: 0.0-10.4%). After treatment with H2-mixed gas, we found that the forward motility in 16 suspensions significantly increased (Figure\u00a02). Sperm motility in 4 suspensions improved with both H2- and N2-mixed gases, except for one suspension, which was not activated by both mixed gases. The average forward motilities in sperm suspensions after treatment with H2- and N2-mixed gases were 11.0% (90% CI: 2.7-20.0%) and 3.6% (90% CI: 0.0-17.6%), respectively.

Firstly, ejaculated sperm must be kept for 3\u00a0days at our clinic for infertility treatments, and remaining sperms for discard were used.

The change in motility by H2 treatment was higher than or similar to results previously reported, e.g., 17.95% to 25.1% for treatment with platelet-activating factor [27] and a 21% increase for exogenous pyruvate treatment [28]. Because the increase of forward motility was observed within only 30\u00a0min, H2 treatment may stimulate cell signaling and activate mitochondria, but not transcription and translation in sperm. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the stimulatory effects are dependent on a property of H2 as a reductant. Furthermore, H2, but not N2, stimulated sperm motility, indicating that the effect of H2 did not rely on mechanical stimuli.",
                "Effects were evident in almost all sperm suspensions (16 out of 17) with higher survival rates in which an increase of forward motility was observed with H2 treatment (Figure\u00a02). Slight increase of the motility treated with N2 may due to the effect of mixing and shaking of sperm suspension during experimental manipulation [29]. The samples used in this study were collected from various patients with different physiological conditions and genetic backgrounds; therefore, it is possible that the effects of H2 rely on the character of each sperm suspension. The lack of response in forward motility in sperm suspensions with low survival rates indicated that H2 treatment was less effective on complete or nearly complete necrozoospermia. However, we found that H2 treatment stimulated a very sluggish motility of several sperms in 3 out of 13 suspensions with low survival rates, further indicating that H2 is beneficially effective on movement of sperms with both high and low survival rates. The differential effects of H2 treatment may be dependent on various conditions of sperm.",
                "H2 did not enhance the sperm swimming speed (Figure\u00a03), indicating that H2 did not hyperactivate sperm. Hyperactivation is characterized by a more energetic and less symmetric beat of sperm flagella and can be achieved in vitro by seminal plasma removal and incubation of sperm in capacitating medium. However, several reagents, including caffeine, which can stimulate sperm movement, have no effect on sperm velocity [30]. On the other hand, exogenous pyruvate accelerates glycolysis, and stimulates motility and hyperactivation with an increase in intracellular ATP levels [28]. It has been reported that glucose-derived ATP during capacitation involves hyperactivation [31], indicating that H2 treatment does not affect glycolysis.",
                "We found that the higher sperm motility induced by H2 treatment was maintained for 2.5\u00a0h, even in the absence of H2 (Figure\u00a04), which is clinically enough time for IVF and ICSI. The decrease in motility after H2 treatment is due to several reasons, including the reduction of intracellular ATP, and oxidative stress of oxygen in the room air [32]. Nevertheless, the motility increased the following day after a second H2 treatment. The increase of motility with second treatment of H2 was still higher than that of N2, indicating that the repeated increase was due to H2, but not mechanical stimuli. The repeated stimulation of sperm is likely to be useful in a clinical setting. Higher variation of the mobility in H2-treated sperm in Figure\u00a04 may be dependent on its higher mobility, because the difference of coefficients of variation between the mobility of H2-treated sperm (0.26 to 0.59%) and that of N2 (0.48 to 0.98%) was very low.",
                "A functional relationship among sperm mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm motility, and fertility potential has been proposed [33]. We found that H2 treatment enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure\u00a05). Since sperm motility is dependent on ATP content, we speculate that H2 treatment enhances mitochondrial function, promotes ATP production, and then stimulates sperm motility. Indeed, we observed previously that H2 prevented a decrease in cellular levels of ATP synthesized in mitochondria [14]. Precise measurements of both ATP and calcium in sperm are needed before and after treatment with H2.",
                "Finally, we used frozen-thawed sperm suspensions to validate the effects of H2 treatment on the motility of damaged sperm. Frozen sperm suspension is used routinely in assisted reproduction treatment. However, freezing has been reported to cause changes in sperm morphology, including damage to mitochondria. Sperm motility is particularly sensitive to freezing damage [34,35]. Effects were evident in 13 out of 15 suspensions of low motile frozen-thawed sperm (86.7%) in which an increase of forward motility was observed with sperm-wash medium containing 50% of H2 (Figure\u00a06b), indicating that H2 treatment is clinically a potential approach to activate low motility sperm. However, treatment with medium containing higher concentration, 100%, of H2 was not effective, indicating the possibility that very low concentration of O2 in the medium might repress the sperm motility [36]. Further study is needed to elucidate a dose-dependency of H2-treatment.",
                "The fertilization rates after IVF and ICSI using normal sperm are approximately 60% and 70%, respectively [37]. In general, the decision to perform either IVF or ICSI is dependent on sperm quality [38], which is determined by the total number of motile sperm [39]. While the concentration and morphology of ejaculated sperm do not affect ICSI results, the injection of a completely immotile spermatozoon is likely to have a negative effect on fertilization and the pregnancy rate [21,40]. Currently, there is no efficient therapy for asthenozoospermia."

                "The findings of this study strongly indicate that H2 treatment activates low motility sperms. Importantly, recent studies demonstrated that H2 might have potential for wide use in medical applications as a novel, safe, effective antioxidant with minimal side effects [14-19]. We propose here that H2 is a new promising agent for male infertility treatment. However, to make practical use of H2 treatment, we further need to examine the effects of H2-treated sperm on fertilizing ability, embryonic development and safety for IVF and ICSI in future studies."
