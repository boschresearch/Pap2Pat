    "date": "2018-09-06 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A process to catalytically transform natural gas liquid (NGL) into higher molecular weight hydrocarbons includes providing an NGL stream, catalytically dehydrogenating at least a portion of the NGL stream components to their corresponding alkene derivatives, catalytically oligomerizing at least a portion of the alkenes to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons and recovering the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. The NGL stream can be extracted from a gas stream such as a gas stream coming from shale formations. The higher molecular weight hydrocarbons can be hydrocarbons that are liquid at ambient temperature and ambient pressure.",

                        "The present disclosure is directed to new hydrocarbon upgrading processes that include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to their respective alkene derivatives, commonly known as olefins, followed by oligomerization of the light olefins to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon derivatives. The longer chain higher molecular weight hydrocarbons have a greater value than the lighter alkanes.",
                        "More efficient utilization of petroleum and gas reserves is an important strategy for the deployment of future energy generation. Shale gas has become an increasingly important source of natural gas in the United States, and the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration predicts that by 2040, seventy percent of the United States' natural gas supply will come from shale gas. Many of these shale gas formations contain wet gases, which can include substantial concentrations of natural gas liquids (NGL). NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons made up primarily of ethane (C2), propane (C3), butane (C4), and pentane (C5). Several major shale gas formations such as Marcellus and Bakken are located far away from historically gas producing and processing region such as the Gulf Coast. These resources can be considered as stranded gas. Also, associated gas, which is a byproduct of shale oil production and may contain substantial concentration of NGL, is generally flared, vented, or injected back to the shale oil reservoir at high cost. Construction of pipelines to transport natural gas liquids to large existing processing plant complexes, such as the Gulf Coast, can be capital intensive. This creates an opportunity to upgrade this stranded natural gas, particularly its condensate, or NGL, into liquid fuel for use or further processing as it is easier to transport and distribute to the market.",
                        "The transformation of shale gas to higher molecular weight products such as transportation fuels, fine chemicals and polymers is one of the strategies to utilize the shale gas reserves to their highest value.",
                        "Currently, UOP Cyclar, Synfuels International ETG (Ethane to Gasoline), and Greyrock DFP (Direct Fuel Production) processes are examples of commercialized NGL to Liquids (NTL) processes. The Greyrock DFP process utilizes a small scale Fischer-Tropsch (FT) type process. Unlike a traditional FT process, their proprietary catalyst is claimed to eliminate the need for downstream liquid product upgrading. Synfuels International, Inc. employs a thermal cracking reactor followed by a series of proprietary reactors that ultimately yields gasoline blend stock as the final product. In the UOP Cyclar process, liquefied petroleum gas containing mainly propane and butane is converted to aromatics through dehydrogenation and subsequent aromatization. Aromatics, however, may not be suitable as liquid fuel and its market share is smaller than that of liquid fuel. Therefore, upgrading natural gas liquids into liquid fuel, having a minimal aromatic content, can increase the value of natural gas liquids and enable the distribution of the natural gas liquids into the liquid fuel market.",
                        "Currently, dehydrogenation of ethane is typically accomplished using steam cracking. In this process, ethane is subjected to high temperature (\u02dc800\u00b0 C.) and mixed with steam. The resulting vapor contains ethylene, ethane, methane, acetylene, hydrogen, and steam. Typically, steam cracking vapor undergoes cryogenic separation, at great cost, to recover the olefins and recycle the unconverted alkanes. In addition, steam cracking is usually implemented at large scale; it is unlikely to be economical for small-scale operations in remote shale gas formation regions. UOP Oleflex and ThyssenKrupp STAR processes are also employed for only propane dehydrogenation using their respective proprietary catalysts. Currently, applicants know of no technology to uniformly dehydrogenate a mixture of one or more of C2, C3, C4, and C5 without the use of thermal cracking.",
                        "Upgrading stranded NGLs may facilitate its marketability and distribution into the liquid fuel market for use or into a refinery for further processing. Besides UOP Cyclar, Synfuels International ETG (Ethane to Gasoline), and Greyrock DFP (Direct Fuel Production) processes, no other major NGL-to-Liquid process has been commercialized."

                        "The present disclosure relates generally to new hydrocarbon upgrading processes that include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to their respective alkene derivatives, commonly known as olefins, followed by oligomerization of the light olefins to higher molecular weight hydrocarbon derivatives. The longer chain higher molecular weight hydrocarbons have a greater value than the lighter alkanes. Various embodiments to the two-step process are disclosed along with additional elements that can be implemented such as efficiency improvements and integration into existing processes and/or facilities.",
                        "Dehydrogenation of NGLs followed by oligomerization of the resulting alkenes may have the potential as an economically attractive process. This process is termed as Natural Gas Liquid-to-Liquid (NTL). In the NTL process, a mixture of light alkanes such as ethane, propane, butane, and pentane and combinations thereof are activated by catalytically transforming them into their corresponding olefins. Then, without separation of the olefins from the unconverted alkanes, the olefins are then catalytically oligomerized to form higher molecular weight liquid hydrocarbons. The resulting hydrocarbons may still contain olefins and can optionally have a final saturation step to fully saturate the hydrocarbon liquids. The resulting hydrocarbons can then be recovered and can serve as drop-in liquid fuels, as a refinery feedstock, as feedstock for chemical plants or other uses.",
                        "One aspect of the invention is that, instead of steam cracking, catalytic dehydrogenation is adopted in the process disclosed herein. It has the potential to efficiently transform light alkanes to alkenes. As stated earlier, steam cracking is commonly implemented at large scale and it is unlikely to be economical at small scale. In addition, steam in the product stream is detrimental to the oligomerization catalyst life; therefore, requires separation of the steam prior to processing of the olefins. Production of olefins produced by alkane dehydrogenation allows for direct oligomerization of the mixed olefin, alkane and hydrogen stream without costly separation. Considering the remote locations and discounted prices of stranded gas, modular scale process may be preferable to exploit the economic opportunities presented by stranded natural gas and its condensate and NGL content.",
                        "Considering the heat duty alone, steam cracking consumes approximately 30% more energy for every ethylene molecule produced compared to catalytic dehydrogenation and this is mainly due to the heat demand for steam generation in steam cracking. In addition, given appropriate catalysts, catalytic dehydrogenation can be more selective towards alkenes and minimizes the production of by-products, which would call for the need of either downstream upgrading or removal.",
                        "Another aspect of the invention is deploying the described NTL processes using catalytic dehydrogenation and oligomerization at modular scales. Depending on the location and behavior of the shale gas wells, the economic opportunity presented by shale gas NGL's can be exploited at either large or small scales or both. Modular NTL plants enable local processing of NGL from stranded or associated gas, which then can be directly sold into the local market and mitigates the expense associated with distribution of the liquid products from these modular plants. Process modularization of the described NTL process may be achieved through process intensification, process integration, and novel unit operation designs of the catalytic reactors and other unit operations described in the processes.",
                        "Embodiments of the present disclosure include the addition of an NTL plant to an existing NGL extraction plant. In many instances NGL extraction plants have no market for the ethane, or the economics are such that the extraction, transportation, fractionation and marketing of the ethane costs more than the ethane can bring, thus a net loss for the NGL extraction plant operator. In these instances the plant can be operated in an \u201cethane rejection\u201d mode where a large portion of the ethane is sent out with the residue gas and not recovered in the NGL stream. This contained ethane remains in the natural gas stream and is sold at methane prices and used as natural gas. This is a tremendous waste of a natural resource. The addition of an NTL plant to an existing NGL extraction plant can enable the recovery of ethane by operating the NGL plant in an \u201cethane recovery\u201d mode, having the mixed NGL stream, including the additional ethane recovered, as a feed stream to the NTL plant, and the NTL plant producing a heavier molecular weight hydrocarbon stream that contains little or no ethane content. Optionally the ethane, with or without higher hydrocarbons, can be separated from the NGL stream and fed to an NTL plant, producing a heavier molecular weight hydrocarbon stream that contains little or no ethane content. The heavier molecular weight hydrocarbon stream can then be blended with the NGL stream to produce a mixed hydrocarbon stream that contains little or no ethane content. In this way the ethane contained in the natural gas stream can be recovered and upgraded by the NTL plant to an economically profitable product. The heavier molecular weight hydrocarbon stream from the NTL plant can be further processed in the same manner as the NGL stream prior to the installation of the NTL plant.",
                        "Dehydrogenation",
                        "The present disclosure includes one or more dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes to olefins. The catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons according to the formula CnH2n+2\u2194CnH2n+H2, is a highly endothermic equilibrium reaction, the reaction rate of which is limited thermodynamically and which depends on the respective partial pressures and temperature. The dehydrogenation reaction is favored by low partial pressures of the hydrocarbons and by high temperatures.",
                        "The dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes to olefins can be performed over conventional catalysts commonly known in the art. Commercially available light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts currently in use are Pt\u2014Sn and CrOx based catalysts supported on an alkali (Na/K) modified alumina. A Pt\u2014Sn catalyst is used in the Oleflex process which utilizes a continuous fluidized catalyst bed. The Oleflex process is commercially offered by Honeywell UOP. Alternately a CrOx catalyst is used in the Catofin process licensed by Lummus Technology, a CB&I company, which uses parallel fixed beds. Both of these catalysts are reported to achieve selectivity above 90%. Nevertheless, frequent regeneration is needed in industrial operation and the catalysts have a total life of approximately 1 to 3 years.",
                        "Due to equilibrium limitations, these selective alkane dehydrogenation reactions are typically carried out at a high temperature to maximize the alkene yield and minimize yields of undesired products such as alkynes, diolefins, and cracking products (lower molecular weight alkane olefin mixtures). Useful catalysts must exhibit high activity and selectivity for the desired dehydrogenation process and a minimal rate of deactivation. Dehydrogenation reactions are known to produce coke which is highly refractory and the coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation. Coke removal can require combustion in oxygen containing gas at temperatures greater than 600\u00b0 C. Desirable catalysts, therefore, must retain high alkane dehydrogenation activity following high temperature regeneration.",
                        "The dehydrogenation reactions can be performed over novel catalyst compositions. In one embodiment the dehydrogenation catalyst is bimetallic and comprises a combination of one or more Group VIII noble metal, such as platinum or palladium, and a metal selected from the group consisting of manganese, vanadium, chromium and titanium, on a support. The Group VIII noble metal can be present in an amount ranging from 0.001 wt % to 30 wt % on an elemental basis of the catalyst composition. The manganese, vanadium, chromium, titanium, and combinations thereof, can be present in an amount from 0.001 wt % to 30 wt % on an elemental basis of the catalyst composition and are present, at least partially in the metallic phase. The manganese, vanadium, chromium, titanium, and combinations thereof can, at least partially be present in an alloy state. Non-limiting examples of support can include silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide and titanium dioxide. The catalyst can be an active and selective catalyst for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins while retaining high activity and selectivity even following repeated regeneration by burning coke in oxygen.",
                        "The catalysts of the present disclosure can be prepared by impregnating a support material with manganese, vanadium, chromium, titanium, or combinations thereof, to form a precursor. The precursor can then be dried and calcined. The amount of manganese, vanadium, chromium, titanium, and/or combinations thereof, to be impregnated can range from about 0.001 wt % to about 30 wt %, optionally from about 1.0 wt % to about 5 wt % calculated on an elemental basis of the final catalyst composition.",

In an embodiment either platinum, palladium, or combinations thereof are employed. The amount of noble metal loading to be impregnated can range from about 0.001 wt % to about 30 wt % calculated on an elemental basis of the final catalyst composition. It is desirable that the catalyst will contain from about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt % noble metal, most desirable about 0.3 wt % to about 2 wt % noble metal. As an example, platinum loading on silica can be accomplished via incipient wetness impregnation techniques using an aqueous solution of platinum tetraammine nitrate Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 having a pH adjusted with ammonium hydroxide. Following noble metal loading the catalyst can be dried, calcined and reduced.

                        "The alkane feedstock can be alkanes containing less than 6 carbon atoms. The feedstock can consist primarily of C2-C5 alkanes. An embodiment of the invention provides for the use of ethane or propane or butane or a mixture of these gases as the starting material. Embodiments of the invention are particularly suitable to produce ethene or propene or butene or a mixture of these olefins. The alkane feedstock can be obtained from the side product of various hydrocarbon processing plants, for instance, the offgas of an FCC cracker or other refiners processes, refinery fuel gas, or shale gas hydrocarbons.

Because the temperature in the reaction system is kept constant, the reaction rates may be kept appropriately high. Because of the location of the point of thermodynamic equilibrium, however, the disadvantage is that these high reaction rates can only be achieved at elevated temperatures, because of which the selectivity of olefin formation may be reduced. Hence, consecutive reactions will increasingly take place, so that undesired products may form, such as CH4 and coke.",

The activity of the catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation and the selectivity for alkene formation may in turn deteriorate. This would result in deterioration of the efficiency of the process. To counter-act this negative influence on the process, the catalyst will have to be regenerated after a certain reaction period to recover its activity.",

Because of this procedure, the by-products on the catalyst are reduced, with the result that the catalyst can regain its activity.

A Fischer-Tropsch process of the same size is estimated to have a total capital cost ranging from 300-525 million USD with an annual operating cost between 11-28 million USD. This analysis indicates the NTL process is economically lucrative compared to existing technologies.",
                        "FIG. 3 shows a variation of the process described in FIG. 2. Consider the NTL process shown in FIG. 2, when methane recovery is not very high in separator 100, the high C1 content in stream 20 necessitates very large recycle flow in stream 80 and 82 leading to high capital and operating expenses. Therefore, the process in FIG. 3 is designed to handle poor separation on separator 100. To accommodate for this variation, separator 250 is utilized to maximize the recovery of light alkanes and alkenes from the recycle stream. Separators 250, 180, and 200 along with heat exchangers 195, 240 and pressure changers 190, 205, 230 constitute a multi-stage separator configuration. Vapor stream 75, instead of being directly recycled after an optional purge, is compressed in pressure booster 230 followed by cooling to low temperature (2\u00b0-10\u00b0 C.) in heat exchanger 240 which results in a two-phase stream 95. Stream 95 undergoes two phase separation in separator 250. Vapor stream 96 pressure is increased through compressor 211. To avoid methane accumulation in the recycle stream, vapor stream 98 exiting compressor 211 can be recycled to the feed stream 10 or directly into separator 100 depending on the unit operations that is employed for separator 100. Liquid stream 97 containing a substantial concentration (-30 mole %) of unconverted C3 and C4 olefins with minor concentration of C2 olefin can be heated, such as to oligomerization reactor 160 operating temperature, in heat exchange unit 260. Vapor stream 93 exiting heat exchange unit 260 is then combined with stream 50 which results in stream 99 that enters the oligomerization reactor 160. The recycle ratio of this process was found to be 46% less than that of the process in FIG. 2 in simulations of the two processes. This NTL process was found to reduce capital and operating costs by 8% and 26%, respectively, compared to the process described in FIG. 2.",

Hydrogen tolerant oligomerization catalyst is defined as a catalyst that can perform alkene coupling on alkenes, such as a mixture of C2, C3, C4, C5 alkenes, with a substantial concentration of hydrogen (>5 mole percent). FIG. 4 illustrates a variation of the process described in FIG. 2 wherein a hydrogen tolerant oligomerization catalyst is employed. The partial pressure of hydrogen in stream 103 exiting the dehydrogenation reactor 120 is lower than the partial pressure of the hydrogen in vapor stream 104 as light alkenes have been both converted and removed as high molecular weight hydrocarbons by oligomerization reactor 160 and separator 180. This higher partial pressure of hydrogen in vapor stream 104 can be exploited by performing hydrogen separation with separator 270 to remove hydrogen via stream 101 and produce a hydrogen lean stream 102. Ultimately, this process has a reduced capital expense for separator 270 compared to separator 140 in FIG. 2.",
                        "To minimize heat input into the processes, heat and mass integration can be performed on the described process. An example of integrated process design for the process in FIG. 4 is shown in FIG. 5. In this example, heat exchangers 110, 130, 170 within the recycle loops are coupled such that the remaining heat duty is for the catalytic dehydrogenation reactor 120 that operates at elevated temperature, such as from 500\u00b0-800\u00b0 C. Combined stream 24 enters a process-to-process heat exchanger 280 and is heated using stream 108 and stream 106 which exit oligomerization reactor 160 and dehydrogenation reactor 120, respectively. The resulting heated stream 105 enters dehydrogenation reactor 120 and exhaust stream 106 enters heat exchanger 280. Heat from stream 106 is transferred to stream 24 until stream 106 temperature reaches the operating temperature of oligomerization reactor 160. Exhaust stream 108 from oligomerization reactor 160 enters heat exchanger 280 and transfers its heat before exiting as stream 109. Finally, stream 109 is cooled to low temperature (\u02dc2\u00b0-10\u00b0 C.) and exits a two-phase stream 110. There are other integrated process configurations that have not been illustrated here. This integrated process flowsheet reduces the number of heat exchangers and also utilities costs which ultimately lead to reduction in the total capital cost and annual operating costs.",

In a non-limiting example the recompression of residue gas from an NGL extraction plant may be provided by one or more gas fired turbine driven compressor. The turbine exhaust temperature can be more than 600\u00b0 C. and can be used as a heat source within the NTL process.",
                        "Hydrogen is a by-product of a dehydrogenation reactor and it can be utilized in several ways depending on the deployment of the NTL process. Where the NTL process is integrated into a large refinery complex, then the produced hydrogen can be delivered into processes that require them either as feedstocks or as fuels. Produced hydrogen can be utilized in a saturation step to more fully saturate the produced hydrocarbon liquids and reduce the olefin content. In remote locations, hydrogen must be used or transformed on-site as hydrogen pipeline infrastructure is not extensive. Although it is intuitive to utilize hydrogen as fuel gas to supply heat for dehydrogenation reactor, hydrogen can also be used to fix any available on-site CO2 into valuable chemicals such as methanol and dimethyl ether which are also liquid at ambient temperature and pressure. This proposed NTL process with hydrogen fixation on CO2 is described in FIGS. 6 and 7. In FIGS. 6 and 7, the hydrogen fixation process is integrated with NTL processes described in FIGS. 2 and 3, respectively. In FIG. 2, raw shale gas stream 109 coming out of the wellhead usually contains varying concentrations of CO2, N2, H2S, and H2O, which may need to be removed before it can enter the natural gas pipeline or undergo further processing. The removal process 290 is generally called gas treatment which may entail some or all the following processes: acid gas removal, dehydration, membrane separation, and cryogenic distillation. From gas treatment 290, a CO2 stream 111 is recovered and hydrocarbon gas stream 10 is sent for further processing as described in FIG. 2. A portion of the methane rich stream 92 can be used to supply heat for other unit operations such as a dehydrogenation reactor by combusting the split stream 113 in a furnace 320 with an air stream 114. The exhaust gas stream 115 from furnace 320 enters separator 330 to generate a CO2 rich stream 117. Streams 111 and 117 can then be combined and enter a hydrogen fixation process 340. The hydrogen stream 42 that is separated by hydrogen separator 140 can be sent to a hydrogen fixation process 340. Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol can occur at medium temperature (\u02dc235\u00b0-250\u00b0 C.) and medium pressure (\u02dc5-50 bar) using Cu/Zn catalysts. The resulting outlet stream 119 contains methanol and other products such as higher boiling alcohols and dimethyl ether.
