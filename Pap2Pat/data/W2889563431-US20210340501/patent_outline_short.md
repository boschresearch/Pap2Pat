### Example 1

- describe CHO-K1 cells and RNA viruses
- outline virus infection and innate immune modulator treatment
- detail Western blot procedures and RNA extraction
- explain cDNA library construction and next-generation sequencing
- describe genetic engineering and single cell sorting

### Results and Discussion

- evaluate CHO cell response to RNA viruses
- analyze type I IFN response in CHO cells
