### EXAMPLES

- describe drug delivery formulations combined with gastric resident articles
- demonstrate articles capable of one-time administration and retrieval, extended residence, and/or release of pharmacologically active therapies
- describe articles having shapes that are safe for transesophageal administration, safe for retention in the gastric cavity, capable of holding greater than 10 grams
- demonstrate a retrieval system capable of safely being administered through a nasogastric or endoscopic tube, sensing a gastric resident drug delivery device, and/or
- describe Example 1: cylindrical pills of drug mixed with vinylpolysiloxane
- describe Example 2: coated cylindrical pills comprising drug and mixed with vinylpolysiloxane
- describe Example 3: multi-matrix pill with different layers of drug/matrix concentrations
- describe Example 4: drug delivery system made of pills made of hollow tubing sealed with adhesive on the ends
- design a gastric residence system (GRS) for multigram dosing
- demonstrate controlled drug release with coated drug-matrix pills
- discuss in vivo sustained delivery of antibiotic for 4 weeks and preliminary end-user assessment and economic impact of the GRS

### Materials and Methods

- coat drug pills with Eudragit RS 100 and PCL
- evaluate oral pharmacokinetics of immediate release and GRS formulations
- manufacture and evaluate retrieval device
- design and test in vitro stomach model

### Example 6
