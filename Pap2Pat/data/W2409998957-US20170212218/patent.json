    "abstract": "Lidar is an acronym for Light Detection And Ranging. The technology may be used to measure distance by illuminating a target with a laser beam and performing analysis on the reflected laser beam light. In the atmospheric sciences, Lidar may be used to study the optical depth of clouds, the impact of aerosols on clouds, and the interactions between aerosols and clouds on the climate. The present application proposes a lidar-based technology using a diode laser (101) beam sent through a tapered semiconductor optical amplifier (106) and an axicon pair expander (108) wherein the laser light may be transmitted through a telescope (110) at an object to be studied. Upon striking the object to be studied, the laser (101) is reflected and recovered by the telescope (110). The reflected laser is then sent through a heated rubidium vapor cell (115) and a total detection channel (116) for analysis.",

                        "Lidar is an acronym for Light Detection And Ranging. In the atmospheric sciences, it is a technology that may be used to measure range resolved atmospheric constituents such as wind, aerosol particles, water vapor, and others. Lidar measurements may be used in the study of cloud and aerosol interactions and their influence on the climate. Several lidar based technologies are currently used in the climate study field.",
                        "Networks of autonomous low-power, or micropulse lidars, for example MPLNet hereinafter referred to as MPL, use elastic backscatter for cloud and aerosol observation. This technology is capable of supplying qualitative observational data, but does not provide accurate quantitative data. The MPL performs two backscatter-polarization measurements, with three unknowns of polarization, backscatter and extinction. Similarly, Vaisala ceilometers perform backscatter measurements with one measurement and two unknowns (backscatter and extinction) so the two atmospheric optical parameters cannot be retrieved. This requires making certain a priori assumptions regarding the relationship between backscatter and extinction in order for atmospheric optical parameters to be determined.",
                        "Raman lidar is currently used to provide quantitative atmospheric backscatter and extinction by measuring the Raman shifted backscatter intensity of nitrogen in the atmosphere. The total backscatter and molecular backscatter measurement are used to determine calibrated backscatter and extinction. The backscatter of molecules is relatively stable and provides an optical constant employed to compare total backscattered signals. The backscatter coefficient of the target volume can be determined and deviations in the expected molecular backscatter from that actually measured provide atmospheric extinction or transmission data. Raman scattering is several orders of magnitude weaker than elastic backscatter Implementation of Raman lidar instruments therefore require powerful lasers, which, in turn are poorly suited network operation since these are generally expensive, require cooling, may not produce an eye-safe beam, and require routine maintenance such as flash lamp changes and cavity alignment.",
                        "Lidar systems that rely on elastic backscatter signals, allow the laser pulse energy to be significantly reduced, and are simpler to make into an eye-safe system. To make a quantitative measurement of aerosol properties with an elastic backscatter lidar the high spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) technique can be used. The elastic backscatter from molecules is significantly spectrally broadened compared to elastic backscatter from aerosols and clouds. The molecular backscatter can be separated from the aerosol/cloud backscatter by using a narrow band filter to block the spectrally narrow cloud and aerosol backscatter, only allowing the wings of the much broader molecular backscatter to pass. Some HSRL systems have relied on etalons to create these narrow spectral filters but they only offer a limited optical depth and restrict the etendu of the receiver system.",
                        "Etendue is defined as a property of light in an optical system, which characterizes how \u201cspread out\u201d the light is in area and angle. Etendue never decreases in any optical system and a perfect optical system produces an image with the same etendue as the source.",
                        "Iodine absorption cells have been used as spectral filters for frequency doubled Nd:YAG lasers operating at 532 nm, but finding lasers that are small, low maintenance and operate with sufficiently narrow line widths at 532 nm presents a significant cost and reliability challenge.",
                        "What is needed is a network of deployable cloud aerosol lidars that are low-cost, eye-safe, reliable enough to run continuously for years without maintenance, and must provide both qualitative and quantitative optical data without applying a priori assumptions.",
                        "A potential solution is to develop a diode-laser-based high-spectral-resolution-lidar (DLB-HSRL.) This option requires sufficient transmit power, proper wavelength, system reliability, component reliability and a low enough cost in order to make remote network deployment a practical option. However, to achieve the improved data products over existing commercial systems, the DLB-HSRL needs lasers with stable and narrow line-widths and a matching receiver filter with similarly narrow rejection spectra but high optical depth. This must be accomplished without significantly increasing the cost, size, or maintenance requirements of the system."

                        "FIG. 1 depicts a conceptual layout of the DLB-HSRL system. The DLB-HSRL uses a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) 780 nm laser (101) which provides a source with power and frequency stability needed for accurate filtering of molecular and aerosol backscatter in an DLB-HSRL receiver.",
                        "A computer operable (118) standard diode laser controller (117) operates the DBR laser (101) at constant temperature. Approximately ten percent of the laser output (102) is sampled and directed to a wavelength meter (103) or rubidium vapor cell to monitor and lock the laser output wavelength.",
                        "The remaining \u02dc90 percent of the laser output (104) passes through an inline fiber isolator (105) and thereafter into a tapered semiconductor optical amplifier, hereinafter TSOA (106). The laser source is then amplified by the TSOA (106) to produce a transmitted laser pulse and to achieve high enough output power for daytime operation. The current to the TSOA (106) is modulated to produce an output pulse or output pulse encoding where higher energy pulses are generated based on the current pulses supplied by a current pulser component (119).",
                        "The output energy is monitored (107) for later signal processing. The beam is expanded through a pair of axicon prisms (108), then passes through a splitter (121) and a lens (120) to reduce energy lost from the telescope spider (109) and finally transmitted through the inner portion of the telescope (110). This design uses a shared telescope design where the inner portion is dedicated to the transmitter and the outer portion is dedicated to the receiver.",
                        "This laser-amplifier combination does not require a cooling unit and occupies a volume that is a fraction of the size of a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers, also known as Nd:YAG lasers, commonly employed in Raman and HSRL systems. The semiconductor lasers used in the DLB-HSRL are lower cost and longer lifetime than the Nd:YAG. Because these lasers require no cavity alignment, or realignment, or consumables such as flash lamps, they are zero maintenance and are therefore suitable for use in a lidar network. This is a significant contrast to Nd:YAG lasers.",
                        "The received light (111) is collected by the outer portion of the telescope and reflected by a mirror (112), a beamsplitter (121), then through an interference filter (113) and a narrow band etalon for reducing background light. An etalon is an optical device which reflects incoming light repeatedly between two or more reflective surfaces. Etalons may serve as a narrow band optical filter by means of interference effects. The light then passes through a beam splitter (114) where part is coupled into the fiber for the total detection channel. The other light passes through a heated rubidium vapor cell (115) which blocks spectrally narrow cloud and aerosol returns, passing only the wings of molecular returns into the fiber for the molecular channel detector (116).",
                        "A depolarization channel is not shown in the schematic but is easily added by splitting the light on the total channel with a polarizing beam splitter. Light exiting each port is then directed onto to detectors corresponding to the total parallel and total perpendicular backscatter.",
                        "To perform the HSRL technique, a rubidium (Rb) cell of isotropic Rb 87 is heated to approximately 320 K, where the optical depth is sufficient to block strong backscatter from liquid water clouds. Optical depth is a measure of how much light is transmitted through a medium or device. It is the natural logarithm of the ratio of initial to the transmitted optical power and describes the ability of the medium or device to extinguish incident light.",
                        "Operation of the laser occurs at 780 nm wavelength, where the D2 line of rubidium is strongly absorbing. This wavelength overlaps with a well-developed line of necessary commercial components such as the DBR lasers (101), TSOA (106) and silicon-based single-photon-counting detectors. These components are available as fiber-coupled devices, an essential ingredient to maintain instrument alignment in an unattended network deployment. Thus, the rubidium filter in the lidar receiver, coupled with a fiber-coupled diode-laser-based transmitter, enables a low-cost and low-maintenance HSRL technique capable of providing quantitative lidar data products.",
