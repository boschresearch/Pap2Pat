                        "Calcium ions (Ca2+) are involved in many signaling processes in a broad range of cells, tissues and organisms including, for example, muscle contraction, nerve signaling, fertilization and cell division. Among these, calcium transients have been monitored in the field of neuroscience as an indication of neuronal activity and/or health. Action potentials (APs) trigger large spikes in intracellular calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) are widely used for imaging these calcium fluxes. Importantly, GECIs are engineered to fluoresce with a dynamic range based on physiological levels Ca2+ within healthy cells.",

In many if not all cell types, the ability to maintain a gradient of Ca2+ between the inside and outside of the cell is essential to life\u2014once Ca2+ levels inside the cell are equivalent to that outside, the cell can be classified as dead."

Cell-specific promoters are one of the primary means through which specialized cellular functions are limited to a particular differentiated cell type. The ability of these promoters to direct transcription of associated genes is regulated, in part, by the intracellular concentrations and activities of transcription factors in the specific type of cell. Due to their specificity, cell-specific promoters may provide a level of transcription of a transgene that is acceptable to cellular metabolism, thus avoiding the exhaustion of protein synthesis materials and over-accumulation of transgene products that may be toxic to transfected cells. Cell-specific promoters can also be advantageous as they may reduce the chance of activating host cell defense machinery and are typically less sensitive to cytokine-induced promoter inactivation than other promoters, for example, viral promoters.",

The nucleic acid can be introduced by known means, including, for example, the calcium phosphate method, the electric pulse method, the lipofection method, the agglutination method, the microinjection method, the particle gun method, the DEAE-dextran method and other such method. Optionally, the nucleic acid is introduced into a somatic cell, a living organ, a tissue cell or other cell by gene transformation methods.

Such cells are grown on an appropriate fibroblast-feeder layer or grown in the presence of appropriate growth factors, such as leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF). When ES cells have been transformed, they may be used to produce transgenic animals. After transformation, the cells are plated onto a feeder layer in an appropriate medium. Cells containing the construct may be detected by employing a selective medium. After sufficient time for colonies to grow, they are picked and analyzed for the occurrence of homologous recombination or integration of the nucleic acid. Those colonies that are positive may then be used for embryo manipulation and blastocyst injection. Blastocysts are obtained from 4 to 6 week old superovulated females. The ES cells are trypsinized, and the modified cells are injected into the blastocoel of the blastocyst. After injection, the blastocysts are returned to each uterine horn of pseudopregnant females. Females are then allowed to go to term and the resulting litters screened for mutant cells having the construct. By providing for a different phenotype of the blastocyst and the ES cells, chimeric progeny can be readily detected. The chimeric animals are screened for the presence of the nucleic acid, and males and females having the modification are mated to produce homozygous progeny transgenic animals.",

                                "Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) have conventionally been used in the field of neuroscience in live imaging to detect Ca2+ transients triggered by synaptic input and action potential firing. Surprisingly, through time-lapse imaging over long periods of time and quantitative data analysis, it was discovered that GCaMP could be used in detecting neuronal cell death. When a cell dies, its membrane invariably breaks down, allowing extracellular Ca2+ ions to rush into the cell and disrupt the Ca2+ buffering and homeostasis within the neuron and that is required for neuronal function. Nevertheless, cellular proteins and debris remain intact and within the membrane shell long after the membrane integrity is lost. It was also discovered that biosensors, such as GFP and GCaMP remain functional within the debris, emitting fluorescence long after the cell is dead. Therefore, it was contemplated that a large increase in GCaMP when a cell dies could be used to distinguish between live and dead cells.",
                                "Rat primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from embryos (embryonic day 16-18) and co-transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) with 150 ng/well of hSyn1:mRuby-P2a-GCaMP (Addgene #50943) and either Httex1-Q27 or Httex1-Q97 (known to induce neurodegeneration) in a 96-well format. Robotic microscopy was used to image and track individual neurons once every 24 hours for 6 days as previously described by Arraste et al., (2004) starting at 5 days in vitro (DIV). FIG. 17A. The GCaMP intensity was detected and plotted as a percentage increase from baseline (t=0) (i.e., delta GCaMP/baseline GCaMP). Using the morphology as a readout, the time of death was determined for each neuron. FIG. 17B shows Neuron 1 was determined dead at approximately 24 hours, Neuron 2 remained alive throughout the duration of the time course, and Neuron 3 was determined dead at approximately 72 hours.",
                                "To examine the changes in signal increase as a cell dies, rat primary cortical neurons expressing GCaMP6f, mRuby, and HttEx1-Q97 were examined overtime. As shown in FIG. 1A, as neurons die there is an increase in GCaMP6f expression. Using time lapse imaging, it was observed that 0 out of 94,106 dead rat primary cortical neurons examined regenerated after elevated GEDI signal, indicating elevated GEDI signal is terminal. In addition, the ratio of GCaMP6f/mRuby signal from rat primary cortical neurons expressing HttEx1-Q97 and HttEx1-Q25 at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post transfection was determined. FIG. 1B, the horizontal line at 0.75 separates dead from live neurons. Finally, data showed that HttEx1-Q97 is more toxic than HttEx1-Q25. FIG. 18A shows a single neuron expressing Httex1-Q97 that is alive at 0 hrs (5 DIV) and FIG. 18B shows the same neuron after 24 hrs (6 DIV). Similarly, human motor neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells were transfected with 0.2 pig/well hSyn1:mRuby-P2a-GCaMP and imaged with robotic microscopy every 6 hours up to 12 hours. FIG. 19A shows increase in GCaMP signal in individual human motor neurons.",
                                "These bioinformatics data analysis techniques demonstrated that a pseudo-ratiometric GCaMP6f-P2A-mRuby was capable of distinguishing live from dead neurons in culture with a high degree of accuracy.",
                                "Time lapse imaging was performed on cells having either GCaMP6f or RGEDI to determine specificity of response following exposure to different stimuli. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2D, after 10 Hz voltage stimulation no significant change in RGEDI signaling was observed as compared to baseline control. However, after NaAz exposure to induce death a large change in RGEDI signaling was observed. This data demonstrates that RGEDI responds only at death of the neuron and not during voltage stimulation. In addition, GEDI ratio time lapse response to neurons after addition of NaAz showed that the GEDI ratio responds reproducibly with each GEDI variant tested. FIG. 9.",
                                "The RGEDI were also analyzed for their ability to be multiplexed with detectors for parallel analysis of multiple cellular observations. Here, RGEDI-P2a-tag3xBFP was co-transfected with an independent green channel biosensor. A mitochondrial marker mitoGFP, a lysosomal marker GFP-TrpML1, and a cytosolic Ca2+ indicator were each recorded in parallel with the GEDI death indicator at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours post transfection. Time of neuronal death is indicated with a white asterisk. FIG. 10A-C. These data demonstrate that GEDIs can be used in multiplexed analyses and do not impede observations of other cellular reporters.",
                                "To further analyze the GEDIs, time lapse experiments were performed on rat primary cortical neurons expressing RGEDI-P2a-EGFP. Images were collected of both dying and healthy neurons at 0, 6, and 21 hours post transfection. As seen in FIG. 2E, the RGEDI expression level increases in the dying neuron (left) while the healthy, surviving neuron (right) maintains a baseline level of expression during the course of the experiment. FIG. 2F shows quantification of the \u0394F/F RGEDI/EGFP ratio of neurons from FIG. 2E from 0 to 21 hours after transfection and show that the ratio increases in the dead neuron but does not in the live neuron. Analysis of decay rates showed that RGEDI and EGFP fluorescence decay at the same rate after death stably for up to 42 hours after death. FIG. 2G. Together this showed for the first time GCaMP could be modified for use as genetically-encoded cell death indicators. GEDIs are an alternative to other commercially available cell death indicators with several advantages. GEDIs are genetically encoded with low toxicity, they are death-type agnostic, provide acute and robust signal, and can have a dual role as a Ca2+/neuronal activity indicator."

In addition, interpretation of cell death was complicated because these GEDIs were not ratiometric indicators. In addition, because fluorescent debris fades when it dissolves/diffuses, it was difficult to differentiate long dead versus live cells. Thus, it was desirable to generate a construct that could more accurately and/or precisely distinguish a live and health neuron with Ca2+ transients and a dead neuron that is beyond the point of recovering its membrane polarization.",
                                "To achieve a higher separation between live and dead neurons and to inhibit the ability of the sensor to increase fluorescence during normal endogenous Ca2+ transients within healthy cells, a novel set of genetically encoded indicators were designed. These new constructs were specifically designed, in part, to detect high levels of Ca2+ that would not be seen in live, intact neurons. These constructs were designed to remain in the cytosol (i.e., did not contain a subcellular localization signal) and increase only when a cell, for example a neuron, died and extracellular levels of Ca2+ are in equilibrium with the cell debris. Additionally, a second genetically encoded fluorophore of a complementary color was attached with a self-cleavable P2A tag for use as a pseudo-ratiometric standardization signal and neuronal morphology marker. FIG. 8A. Color variants were generated, including RGEDI-P2A-EGFP, RGEDI-P2A-mApple, RGEDI-P2A-tagBFP2, RGEDI-P2A-3xtagBFP2 and GEM-GEDI-P2A-EGFP. The in vitro characteristics for each variant were determined along with predicted Hill Coefficients and Kd for Ca2+ binding. As shown in FIG. 8B the GEDI variants of the present disclosure all have an average predicted Kd greater than 500 \u03bcM."

Supervised machine learning requires large, curated data sets to train models on, making robotic microscopy an ideal platform to provide both training and testing of data sets for machine learning approaches to understanding neurodegenerative diseases. Previous attempts at using machine learning approaches, however, have had disappointing results because of the inability to accurately and fully classify data sets due to the error involved in classifying dead cells, for example neurons, manually.",
