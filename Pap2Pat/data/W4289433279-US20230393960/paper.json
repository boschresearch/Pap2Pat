    "title": "Multiple Attribute Fairness: Application to Fraud Detection",
    "date": "2022-07-28",
    "abstract": "We propose a fairness measure relaxing the equality conditions in the popular equal odds fairness regime for classification. We design an iterative, model-agnostic, grid-based heuristic that calibrates the outcomes per sensitive attribute value to conform to the measure. The heuristic is designed to handle high arity attribute values and performs a per attribute sanitization of outcomes across different protected attribute values. We also extend our heuristic for multiple attributes. Highlighting our motivating application, fraud detection, we show that the proposed heuristic is able to achieve fairness across multiple values of a single protected attribute, multiple protected attributes. When compared to current fairness techniques, that focus on two groups, we achieve comparable performance across several public data sets.",

                "Anti-discrimination laws in the United States regulate two discriminatory behaviors based on protected attributes. These doctrines of discrimination are disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment protects individuals who are affected by algorithmic decision making against explicit discrimination. The standard practice to conform to disparate treatment in Machine learning techniques used for decision making is to exclude protected attributes from inputs. This is easy to achieve in a fraud detection model -one would just need to not use any sensitive attribute while training the model. In contrast, disparate impact addresses outcome discrimination; it recognizes liability for practices with uneven impacts on different protected groups. While there is no single fairness measure that captures absolute impact parity, equal opportunity, demographic parity, and equalized odds [2,4,10,13] have received considerable attention. Efforts from scholars revolve around heuristics to ensure these fairness measures. While these techniques are catered to ensure fairness for any Machine learning technique, they are not always practical to implement in an industry setting. To expound, consider demographic parity, which requires that the outcome rates across sensitive attributes be the same. In the context of fraud detection, for a sensitive attribute \"country\", this would mean that acceptance or rejection rates of online transactions for each country should be the same. This may not be ideal since we observe that the ground truth fraud rates from different countries are significantly different (Refer to Figure 2). This could possibly be explained by the jurisdiction in each of these countries in handling online fraud (stricter penalties would mean lower fraud rates and vice versa). If we were to sanitize our fraud detection model to ensure demographic parity, one would either end up allowing lots of fraudsters or declining lots of genuine users both of which are not an ideal outcome for a firm.  Another approach, equalized odds, aims to achieve the same false positive and true positive rates across sensitive attributes. While this is better than the demographic parity for fraud detection, the measure enforces equal importance to both false positives and false negatives. This is again not ideal for a firm given the cost of type-1 and type-2 errors are different for electronic1 vs physical goods. Lastly, Equalized opportunity, is a relaxed version of Equalized odds that only requires equal true positive rates across sensitive attributes. This again is insufficient since we would not want to deny a genuine customer and hence would like to balance false positive rates as well. Furthermore, while getting to equal rates is possible in theory, it is less practical with daily fluctuations in traffic and fraud patterns. Additionally, from an implementation standpoint, another major critique about the current techniques is that they require multiple sanitizations of the ML model to achieve fairness. This largely arises since majority of these techniques assume binary sensitive attributes. Such constraints are not viable in a fraud detection system that usually deal with high arity attributes and require real time inference. Further, to the best of our knowledge, none of these methods perform sanitization of a machine learning model in a post-hoc fashion across multiple protected attributes. We tackle these drawbacks in our work by introducing a relaxed Equalized odds fairness measure and a one-shot fairness heuristic to achieve the proposed fairness measure. Further, we design the proposed heuristic to have the flexibility to pick either or both constraints of the Equalized Odds definition (similar FPR or similar TPR or both) [10]. Finally, and importantly, we also extend the proposed fairness measure and heuristic to handle multiple attributes."

                "The classical definition of Equality of Odds posits that true positive rates and false positive rates across a protected attribute are the same. It reflects a fundamental idea of fairness, that qualified individuals should be given equal opportunity (true positive rate -TPR) to access a desirable outcome while also requiring equal false positive rates (FPR, ensuring no bias to the positive class) regardless of their demographics or any other sensitive attributes. However, this strict requirement of equality in most settings requires non-deterministic thresholds as pointed out in previous research [2,4,10,13] making it less appealing from a practical standpoint. Further, the current heuristics to achieve such fairness involves multiple sanitizationsone per each categorical attribute value (Ex: one for each country) of a machine learning model to ensure the fairness criterion is met. We deal with these issues by first, relaxing the notion of the standard Equalized odds. Specifically, we relax the equality constraint of FPR, TPR and enforce a weaker, yet practical constraint. Second, we propose a fairness heuristic that sanitizes the outputs of a classification model to conform to the relaxed equalized odds measure. Note: We describe the details assuming a single attribute and later extend this to multiple attributes in Section 3.3."

In the experiments, we set \ud835\udc5b = 2 and investigate single protected attribute with high arity, multiple protected attributes, and also consider the case of 2 protected groups as investigated by earlier studies.",
                                "Case Study : Fraud Detection We first discuss our motivating example, online fraud detection 6 . The aim of the prediction is to assess whether an online transaction initiated by an individual is fraudulent. The prediction model omits all protected attributes as input to conform to the disparate treatment doctrine of fairness measure. However, as evident from 3 and 4 (red color bars) we observe that model exhibits a bias towards the demographic attribute country. A similar trend is observed when we look at the FNRs. As we motivate earlier, from a business perspective, it is useful to have flexibility to sanitize these metrics across attributes  We employ the proposed heuristic on the predictions made by the fraud detector by conforming to both the constraints Eq (1) and Eq (2). From Figures 3,4 (green color bars), we observe that the final \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 with custom thresholds per country considerably reduces the bias towards certain countries. Further, we also note that the FPRs and FNRs across countries conform to the relaxed equalized odds fairness measure -mean across the countries lies withing two standard deviations.",
                                "Next, we consider the exercise on the fraud detector model trained with XGBoost to sanitize across with two protected attributes country and currency. From Figure 5, we observe that we can achieve similar FPRs across the attribute values of currency. From a separate experiment (not presented for brevity), we also observe that sanitizing the model on currency inherently sanitizes it against country given their high dependence.  Model benchmarks: Next, we compare the proposed heuristic to Equalized [10] and Calibrated Equalized Odds [13]. These techniques are aimed at achieving fairness across two groups (E.g. Country is/not 1), unlike the proposed heuristic which aims to achieve fairness across all sub groups with custom thresholds per country. In Table 1, rows 1 and 2, we report FPR and FNR for Country is/not is Country 6 7 (Class 0 and Class 1). and Country is/not is Country 22 and observe that we are able to achieve similar metrics compared to the benchmarks."

                "Income-Prediction This dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository contains 14 demographic and occupational features for various people, with the goal of predicting whether a person's income is above $50, 000. In this scenario, we seek to achieve predictions with equalized cost across genders (single protected attributes, two groups -Male and Female). In this dataset, we consider a scenario where the primary concern is ensuring equal generalized false negative rates across genders, which would help job recruiters prevent gender discrimination in salary estimates. Hence, we choose our fairness constraint to require relaxed equalized false negative rates across groups. In row 3, Table 1, we observe that the proposed heuristic achieves similar FNRs for the two groups -0.77 (African American) and 0.61 (not African American). Also, note that we are able to achieve comparable (similar FNRs) or better performance (better FPRs) compared to Calibrated Equalized Odds, designed specifically to enforce equal FNRs across the two groups. Equalized Odds on the other hand, ensures equal FPRs and FNRs across the two groups, trading off the FPR for a lower FNR across groups (0.46 and 0.34) compared to the proposed heuristic (0.61 and 0.77).",
                "Criminal Recidivism Finally, we examine the proposed heuristic in t he context of criminal recidivism. As noted by several studies earlier, in this dataset, African Americans, receive a disproportionate number of false positive predictions as compared with Caucasians when automated risk tools were used. Hence, we aim to equalize the generalized false positive rate. In row 4, Table 1, we observe that the proposed heuristic achieve a) similar FPRs for the two groups -0.4 (African American) and 0.38 (not African American) b) similar FNRs (0.60 and 0.59 respectively). Note that we are able to achieve comparable (similar FNRs) and slightly better better FPRs compared to Equalized Odds, designed to enforce equal FNRs and FPRs across the two groups. When compared to the Calibrated Equalized Odds, where the weighted combination of error rates are matched (equal FPRs and FNRs as discussed in [13]), we observe that the proposed heuristic performs comparably in terms of both FPRs and FNRs across two groups."

                "We propose a fairness measure relaxing the FPR and TPR equality conditions in the popular equal odds fairness regime [10]. To conform to the proposed fairness, we design an iterative, modelagnostic, grid-based heuristic that calibrates the outcomes per sensitive attribute value (for e.g., different countries). Through a detailed case study of our motivating application, fraud detection, we show that the proposed heuristic is able to achieve fairness across multiple values of a single protected attribute, multiple protected attributes. We compare our work to current fairness techniques and show comparable performance across several public data sets."
