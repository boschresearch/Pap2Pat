                        "Some efforts have been adopted to enhance the susceptibility of the tumor cells toward radiation so that lower dose of radiation may be applied. For example, it has been shown that the presence of chemotherapeutic agents within the tumor during the treatment with a radiation therapy device can somewhat improve treatment response. However, research in this regard is limited.",

A viable cell will have a clear cytoplasm, whereas a nonviable cell will have a blue cytoplasm.

        "3. The use of claim 1, wherein the radiation treatment comprises irradiating the esophageal cancerous cells with a radiation source at an energy of 1 to 10 mega volts.",
        "4. The use of claim 3, wherein the radiation energy is 6 mega volts.",
        "5. A method of treating esophageal cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of armillaridin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.",
        "6. The method of claim 4, further comprising irradiating the esophageal cancer with a radiation source at an energy of 1 to 10 mega volts after the administering of armillaridin to the subject.",
        "7. The method of claim 6, wherein the radiation energy is 6 mega volts.",
        "8. The method of claim 4, wherein the armillaridin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to the subject at a dose of 80 mg/Kg/day for at least 12 times.",
        "9. The method of claim 8, further comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a chemotherapy agent before, together with or after the administering of armillaridin.",
        "10. The method of claim 9, wherein the chemotherapy agent is selected from the group consisting of an alkylating agent, an anthracycline, a plant alkaloid, a topoisomerase inhibitor, a cytotoxic antibiotic, and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",
        "11. The method of claim 10, wherein the alkylating agent is cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, or ifosfamide.",
        "12. The method of claim 10, wherein the anthracycline is doxorubicin, daunorubicin, valrubicin, or idarubicin.",
        "13. The method of claim 10, wherein the plant alkaloid is vincristine, vinblastine, taxol or docetaxel.",
        "14. The method of claim 10, wherein the topoisomerase inhibitor is camptothecin (CPT), irinotecan (CPT-11) or topotecan (TPT).",
        "15. The method of claim 10, wherein the cytotoxic antibiotic is antinomycin, bleomycin, mitomycin, or plicamycin.",
        "16. The method of claim 10, wherein the tyrosine kinase inhibitor is imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, cetuximab, panitumumab, zalutumumab, nimotuzumab, or matuzuman."
