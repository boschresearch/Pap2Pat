    "abstract": "The present invention discloses novel peptides derived from the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1 RA), capable of binding to the cell surface IL-1 receptor 1 (IL1 R1) and interfere with the binding of IL-1 to IL1 R1. This binding thus effectively antagonises the inflammatory effects of IL-1, such as by reducing TNF-alpha secretion from macrophages. This is of potential use as an anti-inflammatory factor throughout the human body, including the central nervous system. The use of said peptides as anti-inflammatory agents for treatment of pathological conditions wherein IL-1 plays a prominent role, such as inflammatory conditions of the body and the central nervous system, is thus an aspect of the present invention.",

                        "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a general name for two distinct proteins, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, which are major pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-1 exerts its effects by binding to specific transmembrane receptors (IL-1RI) on multiple cell types. The effects of IL-1 are counteracted by natural inhibitors such as soluble IL-1 receptors and IL-1R antagonist protein (IL1RA or IL1Ra). IL1RA inhibits the effect of IL-1 by blocking its interaction with the cell surface receptors.",
                        "Therapeutic approaches for targeting IL-1 for anti-inflammatory purposes have been addressed in the art. These include administration of recombinant IL-1R antagonist protein, IL-1 trap fusion proteins, anti-IL-1 antibodies, anti-IL-1RI and soluble IL-1RI and II in experimental models of arthritis (reviewed in Gabay C et al. 2010).",
                        "Peptides with IL-1R antagonist activity are disclosed in e.g. US20060094663A1. These sequences are derived from IL-1RAcP (IL-1RI accessory protein).",
                        "Recombinant IL-1R antagonist protein for use as an anti-inflammatory drug has been commercialised: Anakinra, sold under the trade name \u2018Kinerer\u2019 (See U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,222). It has been approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The drawbacks of anakinra is that (1) it is delivered as an injection concentrate with 100 mg in each dose; (2) it is prepared from genetically modified E. coli using recombinant DNA technology; and (3) it has a high molecular weight (corresponding to full-length IL-1RA)",
                        "Thus, identification of shorter and potent peptides derived from IL1RA may address these disadvantages, in that (1) a lower concentration of the present peptides may be used, (2) the smaller peptides are stable in solution and can be more easily chemically synthesised with a lower associated cost, and (3) the lower molecular weight of the small mimetic peptides enable them to more easily pass the blood-brain barrier, meaning a lower peptide amount is needed to reach working concentrations in the brain\u2014this makes them particularly useful also for treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. Specific targeting also has the potential of fewer side-effects and improved efficacy.",
                        "The WO05086695A2 patent family discloses specific peptide fragments of the IL-1R antagonist protein. These fragments are capable of inhibiting tissue destruction in inflammatory disorders, and may be used to treat chronic inflammatory disorders and rheumatoid arthritis (US2007027082; patent application of issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,674,464). No effect on neurodegenerative disorders is addressed.",
                        "According to US2007027082, the disclosed peptide fragments preferably comprise the subsequence LVAGY (\u201cSEQ ID NO:42\u201d); being present in \u201cSEQ ID NOs:13, 18, 21, 23, 24 and 43\u201d of US2007027082. Reversal of IL-1 induced effects were observed for \u201cSEQ ID NO:13, 15, 23 and 24\u201d in vitro (Example 3), and \u201cSEQ ID NO:18 and 43\u201d in vivo (Example 10).",
                        "\u201cSEQ ID NOs:13, 18 and 19\u201d of US2007027082 further comprise the subsequence SGRKSSKMQA of ILR1A (present SEQ ID NO:1). The shortest peptide comprising the subsequence SGRKSSKMQA of ILR1A having an effect according to US2007027082 is 35 amino acids long (\u201cSEQ ID NO:13\u201d), being 42 amino acids long when a nuclear localisation signal is added for optimisation (\u201cSEQ ID NO:18\u201d). When examined as short as 15 amino acids\u2014excluding the LVAGY subsequence (\u201cSEQ ID NO:19\u201d), no effect is observed on inhibiting the collagenase production stimulated by IL-1 in vitro (Example 3). It is thus concluded in US2007027082 that all peptides active in inhibiting MMP-1 (a collagenase) by IL-1 beta contain residues LVAGY of IL1RA; being common to all 4 isoforms of IL1RA (US2007027082 [0115]).",

Such fragments are shown herein to directly bind to IL-1RI and interfere with the binding of IL-1R to IL-1 beta; which is in contrast to the 35-amino acid long peptide fragment (\u201cSEQ ID NO:13\u201d) of US2007027082 that does not bind IL1R1.",
                        "Short peptides according to the present invention may comprise or consist of SGRKSSKMQA (SEQ ID NO:1) or variants, fragments, or variants of fragments thereof. They have the advantage over both full-length IL1RA (anakinra) and the 35 and 42 amino-acid long peptides of US2007027082 (both comprising the subsequence SGRKSSKMQA) that they are very stable, has a high solubility and also have a low cost of synthesis. These effects occur with a retained ability of the peptides to bind IL1R1 and antagonise the effect of IL-1.",

                        "Furthermore, peptides of a certain short length; such as the 10-amino acid peptide of SEQ ID NO:1, have an increased capability of passing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) to elicit an effect on cells of the central nervous system (CNS); thus enabling use of said short peptides on neuroinflammatory disorders associated with IL-1. An effect on neurons of IL1RA or peptide fragments thereof has not been addressed in the art previously, nor has passing the BBB. A positive effect on neurite outgrowth and neuronal cell survival is shown herein."

The majority of interleukins are synthesized by helper CD4+ T lymphocytes, as well as through monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. They promote the development and differentiation of T, B, and hematopoietic cells.",

                                "The IL1 gene family consists of three members, IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and IL1RA (IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, also IL1Ra). IL1RA consists of a six-stranded \u03b2-barrel closed on one side by three \u03b2-hairpin loops. Although IL1\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 are agonists of the IL1 receptor, the naturally occurring IL1RA functions as a specific antagonist of the receptor (Hallegua and Weisman, 2002).",

                                "Interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1\u03b1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IL1A gene. The protein encoded by this gene is a cytokine of the interleukin-1 family. Interleukin-1 alpha possesses a wide spectrum of metabolic, physiological, haematopoietic activities, and plays one of the central roles in the regulation of the immune responses. It binds to the interleukin-1 receptor. IL-1a is a unique member in the cytokine family in the sense that the structure of its initially synthesized precursor does not contain a signal peptide fragment (same is known for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18). After processing by the removal of N-terminal amino acids by specific proteases, the resulting peptide is called \u201cmature\u201d form. Calpain, a calcium-activated cysteine protease, associated with the plasma membrane, is primarily responsible for the cleavage of the IL-1\u03b1 precursor into a mature molecule. Both the 31 kDa precursor form of IL-1\u03b1 and its 18 kDa mature form are biologically active.",

Crystal structure analysis of the mature form of IL-1\u03b1 shows that it has two sites of binding to IL-1 receptor. There is a primary binding site located at the open top of its barrel, which is similar, but not identical to that of IL-1\u03b2.",
                                "IL-1\u03b1 is constitutively produced by epithelial cells and is found in substantial amounts in normal human epidermis, where it has an essential role in maintenance of skin barrier function. With the exception of skin keratinocytes, some epithelial cells and certain cells in central nervous system, IL-1\u03b1 is not observed in health in most of cell types, tissues and in blood. A wide variety of other cells only upon stimulation can be induced to transcribe the IL-1\u03b1 genes and produce the precursor form of IL-1\u03b1. Among them are fibroblasts, macrophages, granulocytes, eosinophils, mast cells and basophils, endothelial cells, platelets, monocytes and myeloid cell lines, blood T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, astrocytes, kidney mesangial cells, Langerhans cells, dermal dendritic cells, natural killer cells, large granular lymphocytes, microglia, blood neutrophils, lymph node cells, maternal placental cells and several other cell types.",
                                "The most important regulatory molecule for IL-1\u03b1 activity is IL-1RA, which is usually produced in a 10-100-fold molar excess. In addition, the soluble form of the IL-1R type I has a high affinity for IL-1\u03b1 and is produced in a 5-10 molar excess. IL-10 also inhibits IL-1\u03b1 synthesis.",

This cytokine is produced by activated macrophages as a proprotein, which is proteolytically processed to its active form by caspase 1. This cytokine is an important mediator of the inflammatory response, and is involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (PTGS2/COX2) by this cytokine in the central nervous system (CNS) is found to contribute to inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.

This gene and five other closely related cytokine genes form a gene cluster spanning approximately 400 kb on chromosome 2. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. Mutations in the IL1RN gene results in a rare disease called deficiency of the interleukin-1-receptor antagonist (DIRA). Variants of the IL1RN gene are also associated with risk of schizophrenia.",

IL1RI comprises an extracellular portion with three immunoglobulin-like modules for IL1 binding and a long cytoplasmic domain, whereas IL1RII contains the same ectodomain but a shorter cytoplasmic domain.",
                                "The receptors both exist in transmembrane (TM) and soluble forms: the soluble IL-1 receptors are thought to be post-translationally derived from cleavage of the extracellular portion of the membrane receptors. Both IL-1 receptors (CD121a/IL1R1, CD121b/IL1R2) appear to be well conserved in evolution, and map to the same chromosomal location. The receptors can both bind all three forms of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-1RA).",
                                "IL1 associates with IL1RI with low affinity, and the binding of the IL1R accessory protein (IL1R-AcP) to the complex results in high-affinity binding that forms an asymmetric tertiary complex composed of IL1, IL1RI, and IL1R-AcP, resulting in receptor activation and subsequent intracellular signal transduction and cellular responses. IL1RA binds primarily to IL1RI but does not induce signal transduction because it lacks a second binding site. IL1RII is a decoy receptor because the binding of IL1 to ILRII is unable to trigger intracellular signals. The naturally occurring IL1RA and the decoy receptor attenuate the effects of IL1, and thus appears to be a unique phenomenon in cytokine biology (Dinarello, 1996)."

                                "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood and the cerobrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system (CNS), provided to maintain homeostasis. It occurs along all brain capillaries and consists of tight junctions around the capillaries that do not exist in normal circulation. Endothelial cells restrict the diffusion of microscopic objects (e.g. bacteria) and large or hydrophilic molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid, while allowing the diffusion of small hydrophobic molecules (O2, hormones, CO2). Cells of the barrier actively transport metabolic products such as glucose across the barrier with specific proteins. This barrier also includes a thick basement membrane and astrocytic endfeet. The BBB thus effectively blocks entry into the brain of most molecules. This means that many drugs, which would otherwise be capable of treating disorders of the CNS, are denied access to the very regions where they would be affective.",

                                "The brain is an immunologically privileged site under normal conditions. Suppression factors of the immune response include neurotransmitters, neurohormones, neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory factors, and cell-cell contacts via adhesion molecules or CD200. However, no single factor can fully account for immune control. Augmented cerebral immune responses observed in neurodegenerative diseases probably reflect stimulatory signals that override suppressive signals. However, the suppression of immune responses is not always beneficial to neurons in degenerative conditions (Chang et al., 2009). Thus, therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases should help re-establish the appropriate control of immune cells/microglia in the CNS.",
                                "Neurodegenerative diseases are a growing cause of disability in the aging community. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The annual incidence of AD worldwide is estimated to be 4.6 million cases, with one new case every 7 s. By the year 2040, 80 million cases worldwide are expected (Massoud and Gauthier, 2010). Neurodegeneration; the slow progression of dysfunction with a loss of neurons and axonal connections in the central nervous system (CNS), is the primary pathological characteristic of such neurological disorders as AD, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD) (Heneka et al., 2010). In AD, the main characteristics of neuroinflammation include microglial activation in regions associated with A\u03b2 (amyloid beta) deposition and the expression of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). The ratio of the proinflammatory IL1\u03b2 to the anti-inflammatory IL10 is markedly increased in serum in AD patients. The local inflammatory reaction in AD is sustained by activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. Microglial activation can either be neuroprotective or damaging. An acute neuroinflammatory response is generally beneficial to the CNS, minimizing further injury and contributing to the repair of damaged tissue, whereas chronic inflammation is detrimental and damaging to the nervous system. The progressive deposition of A\u03b2 in AD is known to be chemo-attractive for microglia and might therefore provide a chronic stimulus to microglial cells. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, has recently been shown to be protective in AD (Heneka et al., 2010; Krause and M\u00fcller, 2010).",
                                "The implication of the IL1 system in neurodegeneration is supported by the following lines of evidence. Its expression is enhanced dramatically and rapidly following any type of brain injury. All chronic neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by an increase in IL1 expression. Moreover, neuroinflammation mediated by IL1\u03b2 increases the susceptibility of neurons to degeneration. Microglial cells are the main source of IL1\u03b2 in neuroinflammation, although its production is also induced in astrocytes. Decreased levels of IL1Ra have been found in AD patients. Blocking IL1 signaling by increasing the amounts of IL1Ra following brain lesions results in improved outcomes in many experimental models of neurodegeneration. IL1Ra consistently provides neuroprotection. IL1Ra has been shown to penetrate the human brain at experimentally therapeutic concentrations, and clinical trials for introducing IL1Ra as a post-stroke therapy have been designed (Cawthorne et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2008; Koprich et al., 2008; Spulber et al., 2009; Tarkowski et al., 2001).",

It typically becomes noticeable in middle age. HD is the most common genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea and is much more common in people of Western European descent than in those from Asia or Africa. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation on either of an individual's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. Physical symptoms of Huntington's disease can begin at any age from infancy to old age, but usually begin between 35 and 44 years of age. About 6% of cases start before the age of 21 years with an akinetic-rigid syndrome; they progress faster and vary slightly. The variant is classified as juvenile, akinetic-rigid or Westphal variant HD.",

Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant Huntingtin protein (mHtt). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms as the mutated protein results in gradual damage to specific areas of the brain.",
