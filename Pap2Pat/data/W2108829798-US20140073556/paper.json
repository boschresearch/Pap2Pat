    "abstract": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is implicated in neuroinflammation, an essential component of neurodegeneration. We evaluated the potential anti-inflammatory effect of a novel peptide antagonist of IL-1 signaling, Ilantide.We investigated the binding of Ilantide to IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) using surface plasmon resonance, the inhibition of Il-1\u03b2-induced activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in HEK-Blue cells that contained an IL-1\u03b2-sensitive reporter, the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages, protection against IL-1-induced apoptosis in neonatal pancreatic islets, and the penetration of Ilantide through the blood-brain barrier using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We studied the effects of the peptide on social behavior and memory in rat models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and amyloid-induced neuroinflammation, respectively, and its effect in a rat model of experimental autoimmune enchephalomyelitis.Ilantide bound IL-1RI, inhibited the IL-1\u03b2-induced activation of NF-\u03baB, and inhibited the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 in vitro. Ilantide protected pancreatic islets from apoptosis in vitro and reduced inflammation in an animal model of arthritis. The peptide penetrated the blood-brain barrier. It reduced the deficits in social activity and memory in LPS- and amyloid-treated animals and delayed the development of experimental autoimmune enchephalomyelitis.These findings indicate that Ilantide is a novel and potent IL-1RI antagonist that is able to reduce inflammatory damage in the central nervous system and pancreatic islets.",

                "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a key mediator of the acute-phase inflammatory response and has been implicated as the mediator of tissue dysfunction and destruction in chronic inflammatory diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. IL-1 is also believed to mediate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [1]. IL-1 signals via IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI), which binds both the IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 isoforms [2]. Once bound to the receptor, the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) is recruited, allowing nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to trigger the expression and release of a multitude of inflammatory mediators, including chemokines and cytokines. IL-1 antagonists encompass IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1-neutralizing antibodies and the IL-1 trap, a linear fusion protein between the soluble IL-1 receptor (sIL-RI) and IL-1RAcP. IL-1Ra binds to IL-1RI, but it does not initiate signaling, because it does not engage IL-1RAcP [3,4]. These biologics are indicated for the treatment of autoinflammatory diseases and rheumatoid arthritis and have shown promising results in clinical trials for other inflammatory conditions. Anakinra (Ana) is a recombinantly produced protein that contains the N-terminal, methionylated, nonglycosylated version of human IL-1Ra, which competitively blocks the actions of IL-1 without any detectable agonist activity. Ana has been used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset Still\u2019s disease, systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus [5,6]. However, the relatively poor penetration of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) [7] restricts therapeutic use of the current macromolecular IL-1 antagonist proteins for the treatment of neuroinflammation [8].",
                "In the present study, we identified and characterized a novel synthetic peptide, ten amino acids long, termed Ilantide, which is derived from the human IL-Ra N-terminal domain involved in interactions with IL-1RI. We hypothesized that Ilantide would compete with IL-1R signaling, thereby inhibiting inflammatory responses induced by various conditions in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, we found that Ilantide bound to IL-1RI and inhibited the IL-1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and secretion of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) by macrophages. It protected pancreatic islets from IL-1\u03b2-induced apoptosis and reduced inflammation in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The peptide penetrated the BBB, ameliorated decline in social activity and memory in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and amyloid-treated animals and delayed the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)."

LPS-induced behavioral depression was assessed by measuring the reduction of the duration of social interaction during 4-minute sessions. Six- to seven-week-old rats were handled for five days, habituated to the test cages and the experiment room and trained for social interaction with three-week-old juvenile rats introduced into the test cage for four minutes two days before the actual experiment. On the day of the experiment, the rats were intraperitoneally injected (i.p.) with saline or LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in saline (250 \u03bcg/kg). Immediately after the i.p. injection, Ilantide-t (Ila; 10 mg/kg, equivalent to 2.1 \u03bcmol/kg), Ana (100 mg/kg, equivalent to 5.8 \u03bcmol/kg) or saline was injected subcutaneously. The volume of all of the injections was 1.0 ml/kg. Six experimental groups were used: vehicle i.p./vehicle s.c. (veh/veh; n\u2009=\u200910), vehicle i.p./Ilantide-t s.c. (veh/Ila; n\u2009=\u20098), vehicle i.p./Ana s.c. (veh/Ana; n\u2009=\u20099), LPS i.p./vehicle s.c. (LPS/veh; n\u2009=\u200910), LPS i.p./Ilantide-t s.c. (LPS/Ila; n\u2009=\u200911) and LPS i.p./Ana s.c. (LPS/Ana; n\u2009=\u200911). The injections and weighing of the rats were performed immediately after the first test session (0 h), and the animals were tested and weighed again 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours later. Different juvenile animals were presented on each occasion. Social interaction consisted of anogenital sniffing, licking and chewing the fur of the juveniles by the experimental animals and was monitored with a video camera. Animals that showed less than 40 seconds of investigation of the juveniles during the baseline session were excluded. The duration of social interaction at each time point is expressed as the percentage of baseline values and was averaged for each experimental group. Social interaction was scored by an observer who was blinded to the treatment of the animals. For evaluation of levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in blood, rats were injected with LPS and then immediately with either vehicle (n\u2009=\u20098) or Ilantide-t (n\u2009=\u20098) as described above. In addition, a control group of animals (n\u2009=\u20094) was treated with Ilantide-t alone (control). Blood samples were collected at 0, 2 and 6 hours after injections as described for the pharmacokinetics study and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. The levels of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 were determined using corresponding rat ELISA kits according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (all from BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA)."

The social recognition test is a measure of short-term memory and is suitable for studies of AD-like dementia because it evaluates the function of neural structures that involve the cholinergic system, which is impaired in AD [17,18]. The animals were handled for 5 days, habituated to the test cage and trained to interact with a juvenile rat. Three groups of rats were used: a control group of untreated rats (n\u2009=\u200911), an amyloid-/vehicle-treated group (n\u2009=\u200913) and an amyloid/Ilantide-t-treated group (n\u2009=\u200912).

Ilantide-t (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg saline) was injected subcutaneously on days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 after A\u03b2 administration. The social recognition test was conducted on day 20. Every rat was tested three times. The first and second trials (T1 and T2) were performed with the same juvenile. In the third trial (T3), the rats were tested with a new juvenile. The trial lasted 4 minutes with a 30-minute intertrial interval. During each trial, the investigative behavior of the adult toward the juvenile (that is, licking, sniffing and chewing the fur of the juvenile) was monitored with a video camera and scored by an observer who was blinded to the treatment of the animals. Animals that showed less than 40 seconds of investigation of the juvenile during the initial trial were excluded. Social memory was estimated as a recognition ratio (RR). RRfamiliar was calculated as T2/(T1\u2009+\u2009T2). T1 and T2 are the time spent investigating the juvenile animal during the first and second trials. The time spent investigating a novel juvenile (T3) was measured to confirm that the effect seen with the familiar juvenile was specific to cognition. In this case, RRnew was calculated as T3/(T1\u2009+\u2009T3). An RR value significantly less than the theoretical value of 0.5, calculated by a one-sample t-test, was taken as an indication of the presence of social memory."

We studied the binding of the peptide to IL-1RI by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-Ra were used as positive controls. Ilantide-t, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1Ra bound to IL-1RI (Figures\u00a0 2A to 2C). The calculated affinity and rate constants of these interactions are shown in Table\u00a0 1.

As a control, we also measured the binding of Ilantide-t, IL-1\u03b2 and Il-1Ra to a control Ig-like module molecule that consisted of the double-Ig module of NCAM and found no significant binding (Figures\u00a0 2A to 2C). Ilantide-t dose-dependently inhibited the binding between IL-1RI and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure\u00a0 2D), indicating that IL-1\u03b2 and Ilantide competed for the same binding site in IL-1RI."

To test this hypothesis, HEK cells that overexpressed IL-1RI were used. NF-\u03baB activation was induced by IL-1\u03b2. The cells were treated with Ilantide, control peptides, IL-1Ra or sIL-1RI, and the activation of NF-\u03baB was determined by ELISA. Similarly to IL-1Ra and sIL-1RI, both Ilantide-m and Ilantide-t dose-dependently inhibited NF-\u03baB activation induced by IL-1\u03b2 (Figures\u00a0 3A to 3D), whereas the scrambled and reversed Ilantide-t peptides had no effect (Figure\u00a0 3E).

Following the induction of EAE, the animals\u2019 weight, clinical signs of EAE and survival were recorded. The first clinical signs of EAE appeared on dpi 10. From dpi 10 to 14, the animals were treated daily with either Ilantide or vehicle. Treatment with Ilantide-t had no significant effects on weight change or survival (data not shown). As shown in Figure\u00a0 12, however, the clinical signs of EAE were attenuated by Ilantide-t. In Figure\u00a0 12, the data from individual animals are aligned according to the first appearance of clinical signs. On the first and second days, the mean clinical signs were significantly lower in Ilantide-t-treated animals than in vehicle-treated animals. At later time points, however, no difference was found between the mean clinical signs in the two groups. These results show that the treatment of EAE with Ilantide attenuated, but did not prevent, the development of EAE."

The rats were administered A\u03b225\u201335, followed by administration with either Ilantide-t or vehicle. No significant intergroup difference in social activity was observed during the first trial, suggesting that A\u03b2 and Ilantide-t did not influence investigatory activity per se (F2,32\u2009=\u20090.94; P\u2009=\u20090.4 by one-way ANOVA) (data not shown). Social memory was measured as a decrease in the time that an adult rat spent investigating the same (that is, familiar) juvenile during the second trial compared with the first trial. The social recognition RRfamiliar value was <0.5 in the untreated group (t\u2009=\u20097.67, df\u2009=\u200910; P\u2009<\u20090.0001 by one-sample t-test) (Figure\u00a0 13). Animals in the A\u03b2/veh group exhibited a significant deficit in social memory. The rats in this group failed to recognize the juvenile during the second trial.

Treatment with Ilantide-t counteracted the development of cognitive impairment. The RRfamiliar in this group was significantly lower than the theoretical value of 0.5 (t\u2009=\u20094.12, df\u2009=\u200911; P\u2009=\u20090.002 by one-sample t-test) and the value in the A\u03b2/veh group (P\u2009<\u20090.05 by one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls post hoc test).

                "A critical role for IL-1 in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammation has been well-documented [33-35]. IL-1RI blockade is one of the current strategies used in the treatment of IL-1-induced conditions [1], and an IL-RI receptor antagonist, Ana, has already been approved for the treatment of some of these conditions. Despite the high efficacy of Ana, however, this drug has some disadvantages, such as a short-lasting therapeutic effect in 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [36], local injection reactions (for example, erythema, ecchymosis, inflammation and pain [37]) and in some cases depression [38]. Furthermore, the absence of an effect of peripheral administration of Ana on neuroinflammation observed in the present study should be added to the list of Ana\u2019s disadvantages, although further testing with other Ana doses is needed to substantiate this finding.",
                "The aim of the present study was to develop a synthetic low-molecular-weight antagonist of IL-1RI that is effective in the treatment of not only peripheral inflammation but also neuroinflammation. We found that a peptide termed Ilantide, derived from the N terminus of human IL-1Ra, mimics important characteristics of IL-1Ra. Thus, Ilantide binds to IL-1RI with an affinity comparable to that of IL-1Ra and with higher affinity than IL-1\u03b2. Importantly, Ilantide inhibits the binding of IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1RI. Signaling from the IL-1/IL-1RI/Il-1RAcP complex is known to activate the NF-\u03baB pathway [20]. We found that Ilantide inhibited NF-\u03baB activation. We also found that Ilantide, similarly to IL-1Ra, inhibited the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages, thus antagonizing an important mechanism of the proinflammatory action of IL-1.",
                "IL-1 induces apoptosis in insulin-producing pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and the administration of Ana in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus improves \u03b2-cell function [39]. We investigated the protective potency of Ilantide against the IL-1-induced apoptosis of pancreatic islets and compared it to the potency of Ana. Ilantide-t in high molar excess reduced IL-1-induced apoptosis by 93%, which was 1.5\u00d7 the maximal effect of Ana. Unlike Ana, however, the effect of Ilantide was not associated with inhibition of IL-1-induced nitric oxide production, which is consistent with the less effective inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation compared with IL-1Ra (Figures\u00a0 3A and 3C). The molecular mechanism that underlies this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be related to the lower steric hindrance that Ilantide exerts on the IL-1/IL-1RT1/IL-1RAcP interaction complex compared with IL-1Ra, thus allowing the escape of certain parts of IL-1 signaling. IL-1Ra is known to interact with all three IL-1RI receptor domains, whereas the Ilantide sequence motif includes only two residues from the binding site that is involved in the interaction with the Ig3 domain (see Figure\u00a0 1B). Signaling via IL-1RI occurs only if the ligand-bound receptor associates with the IL-1RAcP protein. Two loops in IL-1Ra (\u03b24\u2013\u03b25 and \u03b211\u2013\u03b212) are determinants of the antagonism of IL-1Ra that prohibit ligand-bound IL-1RI to recruit Il-1RAcP [40]. The Ilantide motif is far from these two loops, and the actual mechanism of the Ilantide-induced inhibition of IL-1 signaling might be somewhat different from that of Ana. From the pharmaceutical perspective, the chemically produced Ilantide peptide has a number of advantages over Ana (which belong to recombinant biologics), such as better penetration through the BBB, better stability and less batch-to-batch variations.",
                "Rheumatoid arthritis is triggered and maintained by cascades of inflammatory mediators. The current treatments for RA include neutralizing antibodies and antagonists of mediators of inflammation, particularly IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1. We observed a positive effect of Ilantide in the CIA model that resembled several aspects of rheumatoid arthritis [41] when treatment began in the preclinical stage that corresponds to the first elevation of IL-1 levels in the blood. This result suggests that the blockade of IL-1 signaling with Ilantide may be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis patients.",
                "IL-1 receptors are well-known to be expressed in the brain [42,43], and IL-1 is a key mediator of neuroinflammation. IL-1\u03b2 is synthesized and released by microglia and astrocytes and regulates IL-1RI expression in neurons and astrocytes [44]. The neuron-specific effects of IL-1\u03b2 were recently shown to be mediated by a novel isoform of IL-1RAcP\u2014IL-1RAcPb, which results in the activation of p38MAPK, but not NF-\u03baB, in hippocampal neurons [45]. However, the role of neuronal p38MAPK signaling is poorly understood [46]. We found that both Ilantide and recombinant IL-1Ra induced neuritogenesis and promoted the survival of primary neurons. The neuronal cultures used in our experiments did not contain microglial cells [47] and included less than 5% astrocytes, which could be a source of IL-1 that affects the ability of neurons to differentiate and survive. Ilantide and IL-1Ra likely inhibited the effect of traces of IL-1 on IL-1RI, thereby triggering neuritogenesis and survival mechanisms.",
                "Intraperitoneal injections of LPS have been shown to induce IL-1 production in peripheral activated monocytes and macrophages, as well as in the brain (that is, the hypothalamus and hippocampus) [48]. IL-1 overproduction induces anorexia and depression, causing body weight loss and a reduction of social activity in rodents. One injection of Ilantide significantly ameliorated these effects of LPS, a potent inducer of IL-1 production. This peptide effect was accompanied by an increase in the plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in LPS-treated animals. We have shown in the present study that Ilantide crossed the BBB, which explains the protective effects of Ilantide on neuroinflammation. The ratio between Ilantide concentration in plasma and its concentration in CSF was 55, which is in good agreement with our previous results obtained for other peptides, the peptide derived from fibroblast growth factor receptor (plasma/CSF ratio\u2009=\u200910) [49] and the peptide derived from the NCAM (plasma/CSF ratio\u2009=\u200940) [50]. Reasonable BBB penetration of the peptide can also explain the cerebroprotective effect of Ilantide in the model of AD. IL-1 contributes to neuroinflammation during the progression of AD. Intracerebroventricular administration of aggregated A\u03b225\u201335 induces neuroinflammation, which is manifested by the activation of microglia and astrocytes, neuronal damage and cognitive impairments [51] and overproduction of IL-1 in activated microglia [52]. Our in vitro data show that Ilantide promoted neural survival and neuritogenesis, which is an essential component of neuroplasticity and can explain the mnemotropic effect of Ilantide in the AD model.",
                "EAE is often used as a model of multiple sclerosis in humans. The activation of endogenous IL-1 is involved in the progression of EAE, and IL-1Ra can reduce the clinical signs of the disease [53,54]. Comparisons of the beneficial effects of IL-1Ra and Ilantide showed that a more profound effect of IL-1Ra was achieved by a 26\u00d7 higher total dose per kilogram compared with Ilantide in the present study [54]. Others have shown that the same dose [55] or a lower dose [56] of IL-1Ra has no significant effect on clinical scores.",
                "In conclusion, we have identified a novel 10\u2013amino acid peptide antagonist of IL-1, Ilantide, that binds to IL-1RI and inhibits the IL-1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages. The peptide protected pancreatic islets from IL-1\u03b2-induced apoptosis and reduced inflammation in CIA. The Ilantide peptide penetrated the BBB, diminished the deficit in social activity and memory in LPS- and amyloid-induced neuroinflammation and delayed the development of EAE in rats. We propose that this novel IL-1 antagonist can be used as an alternative to other IL-1 blockers to inhibit a variety of inflammatory conditions."
