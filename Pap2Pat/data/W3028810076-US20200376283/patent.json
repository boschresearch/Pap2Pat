    "abstract": "A two-part NMS-test bench is provided with which instruments, generator voltages, and surgery modes can be evaluated with regard to neuromuscular stimulations. By separating the NMS-test bench in a first part for application of the instrument and in the second part for evaluation of the physiological effect on nerves, a measurement free of artifacts is possible. The spatial and timely separation of the RF-application from the recording of the compound action potentials makes RF-disturbances ineffective. The electrical signals gained in the instrument test chamber can be pre-processed. The recorded electrical signals emitted from the instrument can be evaluated at the nerve model an arbitrary number of times. The variance involved with the recording of compound action potentials during direct use of the instrument can thus be minimized. The separated test of the signals at the nerve model avoids thermal damage of a prepared nerve and falsification of measurement results.",

                        "It is known that neuromuscular stimulations can originate from electrosurgical instruments. Indeed electrosurgical instruments are typically applied with a radio frequency voltage, the frequency of which is above the stimulation threshold for nerves, however, neuromuscular stimulations cannot be reliably excluded. Amongst others such neuromuscular stimulations can occur during the transurethral electro-resection of the urinary bladder as well as during the transurethral electro-resection of the bladder or the prostate in the urology or during the hysteroscopic transcervical resection in gynecology. For example, potential intraoperative complications can occur, amongst others hemorrhages or even bladder perforations during a resection of a tumor of urinary tracts. Typically this is the consequence of a stimulation of the obturator nerve along with a sudden and vehement leg adductors contraction. Such a bladder wall perforation is in any case an incident to be avoided. Known possibilities for avoidance consist of the pharmacological blocking the ability to stimulate the obturator nerve, a deep relaxation of the skeletal muscles of the patient or the operation of the instrument with very low energy input. Each of these measures is correlated with specific disadvantages such that they cannot be recommended as general remedy for avoidance of neuromuscular stimulations. Thus, influence parameters of neuromuscular stimulations shall be investigated in order to consider these during a conception of instruments, generators and surgery regulations.",
                        "For this it is the object of the invention to provide a reproducible determination of neuromuscular stimulations in selected instruments, surgery methods, generator adjustments and surgery techniques."

                        "The inventive method using an instrument test chamber for reproducible testing of an instrument and for recording of electric signals that can be detected in the instrument test chamber when the instrument is activated. The method further uses a nerve test chamber in which signals for stimulation of a nerve model that have been gained by means of the instrument test chamber and that are potentially standardized with reference to their amplitude and/or filtered with reference to their frequency content or otherwise processed and in which the compound action potentials derived therefrom can be measured. The nerve model can be a mathematical model, a model realized by a computer program, a digital or analog model realized by hardware or a prepared nerve. The invention allows the quantification of neuromuscular reactions during use of electrosurgical systems. Such an electrosurgical system is considered to be the entirety consisting of the instrument provided for surgery, the desired voltage form of the RF-voltage and RF-power supplied from the generator to the instrument, as well as the type of the electrosurgical use, e.g. the incision. Due to the inventive method for quantification of neuromuscular stimulations external from a living organism, the risk of neuromuscular stimulations by an electrosurgical system can be quantified already prior to the use with animals or human beings. Thus, a platform is provided that basically adjusts the risk of neuromuscular stimulations in a new electrosurgical system on a clinically acceptable level without the need to execute animal experiments. This allows the acceleration of the development of electrosurgical instruments with concurrently improved safety.",
                        "The invention is based on the separation of the evaluation of the electrosurgical system from the evaluation of the effect on a prepared nerve or a nerve model. The instrument test chamber is part of the evaluation of the electrosurgical system in which the instrument is located that has to be evaluated and is applied with an RF-voltage of a predefined curve characteristic (wave form) and is positioned in a predefined manner. The positioning of the instrument can comprise the arrangement thereof at a predefined location in the instrument test chamber. The positioning can also comprise the movement of the activated instrument, i.e. the instrument to which the RF-voltage is applied, along a predefined path.",
                        "In the instrument test chamber at least one electrical signal is recorded from which a stimulation signal is determined. The stimulation signal is provided to the nerve model that is stimulated with the stimulation signal in this way and can accordingly output compound action potentials. The latter are detected and used for evaluation of the neuromuscular stimulation. For this it can be, e.g. stored in a database together with the other test conditions (instrument type, RF-voltage form, stimulation voltage or power, surgery paths).",
                        "The nerve model can be a technical model (electrical analog or digital circuit or computer program), as already mentioned. Alternatively, the nerve model can be formed by a nerve test chamber that comprises at least a stimulation electrode pair and at least a diverting electrode pair, wherein prepared functional nerve is placed in the nerve test chamber such that it is in contact with the stimulation electrode pair as well as the diverting electrode pair in order to measure the compound action potentials. The electrical signal recorded in the instrument test chamber can be first stored or also directly processed for determination of the stimulation signal. If necessary, additionally or alternatively the determined stimulation signal can be stored. The processing of the electrical signal for determination of the stimulation signal can comprise a filtering, particularly a low pass filtering and/or a temporal scaling and/or an amplitude scaling. The stimulation signal can be standardized for amplitude scaling in that it is referenced with a reference stimulation voltage. For this a standard signal, e.g. a square wave pulse with 7 V stimulation amplitude and a duration of 100 \u03bcs can be supplied to the nerve model as stimulation signal and therefrom the compound action potential with maximum response amplitude can be determined. In a next step the stimulation potential can be determined that is sufficient to obtain a compound action potential that can only just be measured. In doing so, the responsivity of the nerve can be checked based on empirical limit values. In a further step the stimulation signal obtained during the experiment by use of a real instrument in the measuring chamber can be amplified or attenuated until it corresponds to the compound action potential gained by the test impulse or with a defined fraction thereof. In doing so, the stimulation signal is preferably adjusted to an amplitude that yields to a compound action potential that is smaller than the maximum compound action potential, however, larger than the minimum compound action potential that can be measured at a nerve model. The inventive method can also comprise that the compound action potential provided by the nerve model is further processed before it is used for the evaluation of a surgical system. For this a non-functional nerve that can be for example removed from an animal, can be arranged in the nerve test chamber that is applied with the same stimulation signal as the functional nerve. The signal provided by the non-functional nerve can be subtracted from the compound action potential of the functional nerve in order to calculate a signal transmission of the stimulation signal from the compound action potentials that does not stem from the function of the nerve.",
                        "The non-functional nerve can be a prepared nerve with a bruise location that is placed between the stimulation electrode pair and the diverting electrode pair.",
                        "The device for quantification of neuromuscular stimulations external from a living organism that also belongs to the invention is suitable and configured for carrying out the inventive method. For this the device comprises particularly an instrument test chamber comprising a first compartment and a second compartment that are separated from each other by a wall and that are at least partly filled with the same or different liquids respectively. The liquid is preferably an electrolyte, preferably saline solution at least in one of the compartments, preferably in the second. While the instrument is arranged in the first compartment and is potentially moved, the diverting electrodes are positioned in the second compartment. The wall for separation of the compartments can be formed by tissue explanted from an organism, e.g. a bladder wall. It is, however, also possible to configure the wall from another natural material or plastic material in order to provide reproducible results.",

These signals can be directly supplied from the diverting electrodes to the processing unit or can be buffered before. In the latter case a storage device is arranged between the diverting electrodes and the processing unit.",

In doing so, it is possible to contrast different surgery systems and compare them, for example, with regard to the used instruments and their electrode shapes, the used RF-voltage and the wave form thereof as well as with reference to the incision path."

The nerve model comprises in each case an input 31 and an output 32 that supplies a compound action potential (CAP) 32 or multiple CAPs, if a stimulation signal above a control threshold is supplied to the input 31. In the present case the nerve model 30 is formed by a nerve test chamber 33 that comprises a series of preferably stick-like electrodes orientated parallel to each other in a predefined distance of, e.g. 5 mm, on which a prepared nerve 34 that is, for example removed from an animal, is led such that it contacts the stick-like electrodes.",

Signals recorded too close to the electrode 17 can be disturbed. Signals recorded too far away can be too weak. Preferably the signal of the electrodes 22-25 is selected that is about 3 mm distant from the cut, i.e. from the electrode 17.

It is therefore useful to replace nerve 34 by a non-functional nerve that contains a bruise location between the stimulation electrodes 39, 40 and the diverting electrodes 41, 42 at which the stimulation propagation is interrupted. The signal transmitted by such a non-functional nerve to the diverting electrodes 41, 42 can be subtracted from the corresponding signal of the functional nerve 34 measured at the diverting electrodes 41, 42. In doing so, the signal conducted by nerve 34 can be detected and stored free of artifacts, stimulus artifacts are avoided.",

The stimulation signal that is reliably sufficient for this is, e.g. a 7 V signal. Those electrodes are now selected as diverting electrodes 41, 42 that have a predefined distance of, for example 1.5 cm to the stimulation electrodes 39, 40. If the compound action potentials arriving at the diverting electrodes should be too small, i.e. falling below a predefined limit (amplitude), the distance can be shortened, e.g. to 1 cm.",
                        "Alternatively, those electrodes 41, 42 can be selected as diverting electrodes 41, 42 at which at least a compound action potential of 3 mV can be measured. If the test is started with the electrode pair that is arranged farthest to the right, diverting electrode pairs are selected that are arranged further to the left, if a compound action potential of at least 3 mV is not achieved. In the next step standard square wave impulses of, for example 100 \u03bcs duration can be applied at the stimulation electrodes 39, 40, wherein the stimulation amplitude starts at a low level of, e.g. 100 mV and is increased or decreased in a stepwise manner. If the amplitude that is necessary at the stimulation electrodes 39, 40 in order to be able to detect any compound action potential at the diverting electrodes 41, 42, is larger than 500 mV, electrodes that are arranged farther to the left are selected as diverting electrodes in a stepwise manner. In doing so, those electrodes are selected as diverting electrodes 41, 42 with which a standardized measurement is possible.",
                        "According to the invention, a two-part NMS-test bench 10, 11 is provided with which instruments 16, generator voltages and/or surgery modes can be evaluated systematically with regard to neuromuscular stimulations. By separating the NMS-test bench in a first part 10 for application of the instrument and in the second part 11 for evaluation of the physiological effect on nerves 34, a measurement free of artifacts is possible. The spatial and timely separation of the RF application from the recording of the compound action potentials makes RF-disturbances ineffective that otherwise emit from the instrument and disturb the measurement. In addition, the electrical signals gained in the instrument test chamber can be subject to a pre-processing, such as for example a filtering, an amplification or attenuation. The recorded electrical signals emitted from the instrument can be subject to an evaluation at the nerve model 30 in an arbitrary number of times. The variance that is involved with the recording of the compound action potentials during direct use of the instrument can thus be minimized. In addition, the separated test of the obtained signals at the nerve model 30 avoids thermal damage of a prepared nerve 34 and thus a falsification of measurement results. In addition, the equipment expenses for evaluation of electrosurgical systems with regard to neuromuscular stimulations is reduced by the present invention."
