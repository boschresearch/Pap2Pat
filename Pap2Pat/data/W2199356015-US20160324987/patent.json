    "abstract": "Described herein are methods and compositions for genomic editing. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic (CRISPR) allows for highly selective targeting and alteration of genetic loci. Here, the Inventors demonstrate CRISPR as capable of being used in living animals to prophylactically prevent a genetic disease from manifesting. Targeting and disruption of mutated rhodopsin gene prevents progression of retinitis pigmentosa in the retinal cells of a transgenic rat model. Such techniques allow for treatment methods in subjects with dominant genetic mutations, often associated with lack of a gene product, or a toxic gene product. The described technology effectively abrogates deleterious effects due to the presence of a mutated gene copy allowing the normal function of the wild-type protein to prevent cell and vision loss. The efficacy of these in vivo mechanisms are widely extensible to similar dominant negative gene mutations causing disease, or other types of genetic disease.",

                        "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic degenerative eye disease resulting in severe vision impairment and blindness due to degeneration of the rod photoreceptor cells in the retina. This particular form of retinal dystrophy manifests itself beginning with compromised peripheral and dim light vision due to the decline of the rod photoreceptors. Further rod degeneration is coupled with later abnormalities in adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the deterioration of cone photoreceptor cells. As peripheral vision becomes increasingly compromised, patients experience progressive \u201ctunnel vision\u201d and eventual blindness. Affected individuals acquire initial symptoms independent of age and diagnosis occurs anywhere from early infancy to late adulthood, and may further include defective light-dark adaptations, night blindness, and the accumulation of bone spicules in the eye.",
                        "Underlying this disease, RP is one of the most common forms of inherited retinal degeneration and multiple genes, when mutated, can cause the RP phenotype. Among these, include mutations of the gene for rhodopsin, a pigment that plays a critical role in the visual transduction cascade ordinarily providing for vision, including low-light conditions. Many such mutations in rhodopsin are missense mutations causing negative function that is inherited mostly in a dominant manner. This includes up to 50% of patients with RP, which is 1 in 8,000 Americans. As of now, the number of these mutations that may be treatable with the conventional technology (e.g., gene therapy) is approximately 5%.",
                        "A promising technology for the correction of disease caused by genetic mutations involves used of Clustered Regularly interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated protein (cas protein, such as cas9). This gene editing technology allows for the insertion of targeted breaks in genomic DNA at very specific sites, as selected based on a particular DNA sequence. A variety of in vitro uses for CRISPR has been demonstrated including alteration of cells of various kinds such as bacteria, zebrafish, C. elegans, among many others, providing valuable insights into developmental mechanisms. However, only a handful of attempts have been made to develop CRISPR as an in vivo deliverable therapy to treat subjects afflicted with a genetic disease.",

Those in need of treatment may include those already with the ailment as well as those prone to have the ailment or those in whom the ailment is to be prevented.",
                        "As described, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogenous group of inherited retinal degenerations resulting from multiple possible gene mutations that cause initial loss of night vision followed by progressive loss of visual acuity and progressive blindness. Heterogeneity in RP poses a significant challenge to development of therapeutic strategies and precludes understanding of the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of the disease. Nevertheless, mutations in rhodopsin (RHO), a critical molecule in the visual cascade, accounts for a significant number of those afflicted. Current mutation-focused approaches for treating RP have delivered promising results, but with significant limitations. For example, one type of gene supplementation therapy targeting RP at the level of the gene mutation. This includes RPE65 gene therapy for RPE65-related early onset retinal dystrophy, a particulate form of RP. Results indicated successful rescue of visual function and improved pupillary light reflex in pediatric patients. Replacement of the REP1 gene for choroideremia similarly found improved visual acuity and retinal sensitivity. But for applications such as RPE65, functional rescue effect was coupled with unmitigated structural and cellular degeneration. Such results suggest current mutation focused approaches provide only a limited window of efficacy for gene therapy, limited by treatment magnitude and/or timeliness, where insufficient or late addition of the normal gene copy to retinal cells will fail to halt or modify the disease course.",
                        "As a result, gene editing tools using bacterial Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (cas) system provides a totally new therapeutic avenue, wherein gene editing of the dominant negative mutation form of the disease could stymie progressive vision loss in RP. In particular, dominant negative form of RP requires that only one mutated copy of the gene suffice to initiate RP disease pathogenesis, whether by reduction in the level of wild-type protein (haploinsufficiency), by a gain of a deleterious function (dominant negative effect), or a combination of the two. Dominant mutations may also lead to disease by causing the buildup of toxic proteins. Simple gene-replacement therapy is often insufficient to overcome the presence and expression of the mutant allele. Because there can be many disease-causing dominant mutations in a single gene, targeted gene elimination or repair for each separate mutation is problematic or infeasible using existing approaches. An alternative approach would be to block production of toxic actors, promote cell survival and clearance of toxic buildup, preserve affected retinal cells, thereby slowing the course of degeneration.",
                        "More specifically, a common mutation associated with autosomal dominant RP includes mutations in rhodopsin (RHO) or the peripherin (RDS) gene. As the first mutation described for RP, disruption in this visual pigment rhodopsin (RHO) gene in rod-photoreceptor cells leads to the impaired vision associated with RP. This impartment in RHO function is highly deleterious by disabling a critical first step in phototransduction. Consisting of a protein moiety, an opsin, and a nonprotein moiety chromophore 11-cis-retinal, opsin is a hepatrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), localized predominantly in the disk membranes of rod outer segments, whereupon isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal upon absorption of a photon induces changes in opsin structure. This change activates the G protein transducin, thus initiating the biochemical cascade known as phototransduction. More than 120 mutations located in all three domains of RHO\u2014intradiskal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic\u2014are associated with RP, which is perhaps unsurprising given the intricate conformational steps associated with the opsin protein and its role in phototransduction. Importantly, almost all mutations in RHO lead to the production of aberrant protein, accounting for the dominant negative function of RHO in RP.",
                        "For example, a rhodopsin mutation encoding a proline-to-histidine substitution at position 23 (P23H) results in P23H rhodopsin mutants that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and are unable to associate with 11-cis-retinal. Unable to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, large quantities of unfolded, mutant protein accumulate as ubiquitinated P23H in the cytoplasm. Similar to other dominant inherited neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the formation of intracellular protein aggregates of abberant protein is associated with cellular degeneration. This toxic gain of function from misfolded RHO induces degeneration of photoreceptors, so as to lead to dominant disease penetrance, whereby mutations of only one allele can lead to visual impairment. Another similar mutation is peripherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein that, along with an associated protein, retinal outer-segment membrane, is localized to the rim region of outer-segment disks in rods and cones. RDS mutations in humans display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with over 90 human mutations in RDS identified. A common feature of these disorders is the loss of macular (central retinal) photoreceptors, a phenotype also seen throughout the RDS\u2212/\u2212 mouse retina.",
                        "Gene replacement strategies in clinical trials for retinal degenerative diseases were designed to compensate for the biallelic inheritance of recessive, loss-of-function mutations. This approach, however, is inapplicable to adRP in which disease penetrance is conferred by a monoallelic, gain-of function mutation. Twenty-four genes have been implicated in adRP etiology, with Rho variations constituting the highest proportion of RP cases. Studies in transgenic animals bearing dominant Rho mutations showed that disease severity can be mitigated by silencing the mutant RNA transcript, or via transcriptional suppression using an allele-independent approach to target both mutant and wild-type genes. The caveat to these approaches, however, is the requisite supplementation with the wild-type Rho (RhoWT) transcript.",
                        "Allele-specific genomic ablation using CRISPR/Cas9 may present a simplified therapeutic strategy in which retinal function is restored by the remaining RhoWT allele in adRP patients. Though two RhoWT alleles will remain following transgene ablation in the model used here, patient hemizygosity does not manifest in haploinsufficiency as RhoWT expression between 50 and 200% is clinically asymptomatic. Moreover, as little as 10% of total Rho expression from a control transgene was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute the WT phenotype in Rho knockout mice. Accordingly, adRP may be amenable to allele specific ablation therapy without requiring exogenous RhoWT supplementation.",
                        "Transgenic S334ter rats that possess the mouse genomic fragment containing RhoS334 show phenotypic similarity to human class-I RHO mistrafficking mutations; exhibiting continual PR loss and commensurate vision decline. The S334ter mutation generates a serine substitution at amino acid position 334/338 for a stop codon resulting in early termination (\u201cter\u201d), and RHO truncation by 15 Cterminal residues. The resultant peptide (RHOS334) lacks three serines required for photoreceptor (PR) deactivation following light stimulation, and part of the signal sequence required for RHO trafficking to photoreceptor outer segments. The morphological development of POS is critical to support phototransduction, and is absent in line-3 S334ter rats (S334ter-3). As RHO constitutes approximately 85% of the total protein content in PRs, its retention in processing organelles at the cell body instigates PR toxicity, and is compounded by constitutive PR activity, resulting in apoptosis.",
                        "The Inventors hypothesized that the selective ablation of RhoS334 in vivo would eliminate the RHOS334 production and toxicity, and allow native RhoWT to restore the phenotype to that of the non-dystrophic retina. The Inventors used CRISPR/Cas9 to selectively disrupt RhoS334 by utilizing the requirement of Cas9 activity on the recognition of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) present in RhoS334, which diverges from the RhoWT sequence by one nucleotide (5\u2032-TGG-3\u2032 versus 5\u2032-TGC-3\u2032, respectively). Here The Inventors show that this single base pair difference facilitated discrimination between Rho alleles during Cas9 cleavage, which permitted the unabated function of RhoWT to prevent RP pathology and loss of visual acuity."

Yet, the most recent advances in Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated endonuclease protein (cas) system extend this versatility and convenience by reducing the number of steps required for designing targeting of a particular mutation.",
                                "Briefly, genome editing using tools such as ZFNs can be based on the introduction of a site-specific DNA double stranded break (DSB) into the locus of interest. Key to this process is the cellular repair mechanism for efficiently repairing DSBs via the homology-directed repair (HDR), or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways. The mechanisms of these DNA repair pathways can generate defined genetic outcomes. More specifically, genome editing using ZFNs can be based on the introduction of a site-specific DNA DSB into the locus of interest. Thereafter, NHEJ repair, can rapidly and efficiently ligate two broken ends, providing opportunity for the gain or loss of genetic information. This feature can be exploited to introduce small insertions and/or deletions at the site of the break, thereby allowing disruption of a target gene. If, for example, a disease results from toxic protein buildup, instruction of a nonsense or missense sequence effectively eliminates aberrant protein to correct human disorders caused by inherited gene defects. Alternatively, if a specifically-designed homologous donor DNA is provided in combination with the ZFNs, this template can result in gene correction or insertion, as repair of the DSB can include a few nucleotides changed at the endogenous site or the addition of a new gene at the break site.",
                                "While pioneering much of what is known about genomic editing process, significant challenges exist with conventional technologies such as ZFNs, and TALENs. These early generation nucleases, ZFNs and TALENs are artificial fusion proteins composed of an engineered DNA binding domain fused to a non-specific nuclease cleavage domain from the FokI restriction enzyme. Zinc finger and transcription activator-like effector repeat domains with customized specificities can be joined to bind to extended DNA sequences. While adaptation of ZFNs and TALENs by modifying the DNA-binding specificities provide a significant level of targeting control, individual zinc finger domains provide some heterogeneity requiring some context-dependence for DNA binding. TALE repeat domains appear less susceptible to these context-dependent effects and can be modularly assembled to recognize virtually any DNA sequence via a simple one-to-one code between individual repeats and the four possible DNA nucleotides, but assembly of DNAs encoding large numbers of highly conserved TALE repeats can require the use of non-standard molecular biology cloning methods.",
                                "Whereas both ZFNs and TALENs involving use protein-DNA interactions for targeting, bacterial CRISPR-Cas system is unique and flexible due to utilization of RNA as the moiety that targets the nuclease to a desired DNA sequence. In contrast to ZFN and TALEN platforms, CRISPR-CAS uses simple Watson-Crick base pairing rules between an engineered RNA and the target DNA site. Generally, two components form the core of a CRISPR nuclease system, a Cas nuclease (e.g., cas9) and a guide RNA (grNA), the gRNA derived from a fusion of CRISPR-derived RNAs (\u201ccrRNA\u201d) and trans-acting antisense RNA (\u201ctracRNA\u201d). In the most well-studied example, the single gRNA complexes with a cas protein (e.g., cas9) to mediate cleavage of target DNA sites that are complementary to the first (5\u2032) 20 nts of the gRNA and that lie next to a protospacer adjacent motif (\u201cPAM\u201d) sequence (canonical form of 5\u2032-NGG for Streptococcus pyogenes cas9, but also alternate 5\u2032-NAG exist). Thus, with this system, Cas9 nuclease activity can be directed to any DNA sequence of the form N20-NGG simply by altering the first 20 nts of the gRNA to correspond to the target DNA sequence. It is notes that Type II CRISPR systems from other species of bacteria recognize alternative PAM sequences and that utilize different crRNA and tracrRNA sequences could also be used to perform targeted genome editing.",
                                "The Cas9-induced DSBs have been used to introduce NHEJ-mediated indel mutations as well as to stimulate HDR with both double-stranded plasmid DNA and single-stranded oligonucleotide donor templates. The capability to introduce DSBs at multiple sites in parallel using the Cas9 system is a unique advantage of this platform relative to ZFNs, or TALENs. For example, expression of Cas9 and multiple gRNAs has been used to induce small and large deletions or inversions between the DSBs, to simultaneously introduce parallel genetic editing mutations altering different genes in rats, mouse ES cell clones, and zebrafish. Together, these advances in CRISPR/cas-mediated gene editing technology can accelerated the pace of gene-function relationship discovery, and a focused approach for developing personalized therapeutics.",
                                "Despite these advances, the extent of clinical applicability to patients through direct in vivo genome modification is not yet clear. The elegance of the CRISPR/Cas system as allowing for tailoring to target the patient's particular mutation, combined with a delivery system via adeno-associated virus (\u201cAAV\u201d), or also via adenovirus, vectors as optimal vehicles for genome editing machinery can deliver components directly to the organ or cells of interest. There have been limited reports that, for example, systemic injection of an AAV vector carrying a zinc-finger nuclease and donor template construct was able to correct mutant transgenic clotting Factor IX in mice and reconstitute low but clinically detectable levels of circulating protein. In this regard, an AAV-CRISPR system could be delivered directly and locally to treat the diseased retina with some notable advantages. It is noted that S. Pyogenes Cas9 transcript used in the described study may be too large to be packaged into AAV particles, which necessitated in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA at postnatal day 0. However, the smaller transcript of the S. aureus Cas9 allows packaging into AAV particles for translational in vivo delivery at postnatal day 15. Importantly, the PAM of SaCas9 is NNGRRT, different from that of SpCas9 (NGG). In this aspects, one can rely on SaCas9 constructs to be packaged into AAV particles in which the RhoS334ter transgene is targeted in S334ter-3 rats.",
                                "This includes the ability to address dominant mutations via the same gene correction mechanism used for recessive mutations, compactly deliver targeted genomic editing machinery with a limited footprint capable of being delivered via viral vectors, as constant and agnostic to the size of the target gene and maintain the endogenous gene expression stoichiometry. These and other advantages of CRISPR/Cas editing give it a wide range of possible clinical applications.",
                                "Toward these ends, the Inventors demonstrate proof-of-concept of prophylactic prevention and reversal of retinal defects in an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) through targeted gene modification using CRISPR. Specifically, the Inventors demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used in living animals to prophylactically prevent a genetic disease from manifesting, based on targeting and disruption of the specific the mutated RHO gene responsible for causing the disease in the retinal cells of a transgenic rat model. Non-mutated copy of the gene (2 copies for each gene) is not targeted for destruction and functions normally without interference from the presence of the mutated, dominant gene, which prevented retinal degeneration. While conditions such as blindness from recessive gene mutations can also be corrected by supplying the missing gene using the aforementioned method and compositions (such as replacement of the RPE65 gene), a key advance here is addressing those subjects with dominant genetic mutations more difficult to treat due to lack of a gene product, or a toxic gene product. The existence of a mutated gene product, inhibiting or diluting, proper function of non-mutated gene copy provides the dominant negative effect. To date, such disease conditions have been attempted using techniques such as ribozyme therapy in animals to treat dominant RP, but none have involved the use of CRISPR as described. For dominant RP one of two gene copies is mutated, a proposed therapy intends to destroy both copies and subsequently deliver new copies that are not able to be destroyed by the method used in phase-1 (targeted genetic ablation) of the therapy. The Inventors' technology effectively deletes the mutated copy allowing the normal function of the wild-type copy to prevent cell and vision loss.",
                                "Reliable genome editing via Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 may provide a means to correct inherited diseases in patients. As proof of principle, The Inventors show that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in vivo to selectively ablate the rhodopsin gene carrying the dominant S334ter mutation (RhoS334) in rats that model severe autosomal dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (adRP). A single subretinal injection of guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 plasmid in combination with electroporation generated allele-specific disruption of RhoS334, which prevented retinal degeneration and improved visual function.",

The gRNA cooperation with Cas9 has high efficiency of cleavage only in mouse RHO S334 mutation gene, not in rat wild type RHO (which is lack of PAM sequence). In addition, the gRNA sequence also contains one base mismatch compared with rat wild type Rho gene locus, which further ensured the specificity of targeting mutation gene. The gRNA Cas9 targeting site is on the first exon of RHO S334 gene. Upon cleavage by Cas9, the Rho S334 locus typically undergoes NHEJ or HR for repairing DNA damage. NHEJ can be harnessed to mediate gene knockouts, as indel occurring within a coding exon can lead to frameshift mutation and premature stop codon."

The homology between mutant and WT Rho alleles at the gRNA binding locus differs by one nucleotide at position 10/20 (FIG. 6B). gRNATRGT targeted the second of four PAMs identified as unique to RhoS334 to give the greatest probability for allele-specific ablation. The Inventors reasoned that 3\u2032 open reading frame disruptions downstream to the two PAMs in exon 4 risked generating further truncated RHO isoforms, while targeting the 5\u2032-most PAM of exon 1 risked RhoS334 ORF restoration as a consequence of polymerase skipping.

PCR amplified Genomic DNA regions encompassing the gRNATRGT target site were further sequenced after clonal expansion in NEB-\u00e1 to determine indel frequency. The ratio of clones in which indels were detected from two rats represented cleavage efficiencies of 33% (7/21 clones) and 36% (15/42 clones). Indels were not detected at the RhoWT locus, or the next 8 motif mismatch-predicted off-target loci (Table 2). Similarly, histological evaluation using cresyl violet stain showed phenotypic rescue by gRNATRGT treatment compared with the contralateral untreated eye of the same animal (FIG. 13A, FIG. 13C vs. FIG. 13B, FIG. 13D)",

                                "To determine whether the retinal phenotype was altered in S334ter-3 rats, gRNATRGT and gRNACNTRL treatments were assessed by immunohistology at P33. Extensive and robust retinal preservation was observed in gRNATRGT-injected eyes with up to 8 layers of rescued PRs, in sharp contrast to the single PR layer in gRNACNTRL-treated retinas (FIG. 8A-FIG. 8C vs. FIG. 8D, FIG. 8E). PR rescue was observed exclusively in transfected regions demonstrated by coincident mCherry expression, which were the only regions with observable POS formation, morphologically characteristic of the WT-phenotype that was absent in gRNACNTRL-injected eyes (FIG. 8D, FIG. 8E). Furthermore, N-terminal RHO labeling confirmed the absence of RHOS334 from PR cell bodies in the rescued ONL (FIG. 8B), while C-terminal labeling showed RHOWT to be strictly confined to POS (FIG. 8C). These data suggest that RhoS334 was ablated and the toxic effect of RHOS334 was removed in transfected regions, which subsequently permitted proper RHOWT trafficking, POS formation, and PR survival. gRNACNTRL-treated retinas lacked appreciable amounts of either RHO isoform at P33 due to extensive degeneration (FIG. 8D, FIG. 8E).",

In addition, gRNATRGT treatment preserved the dendritic arborization of rod-bipolar cells (PKC-\u03b1, FIG. 9I) and synaptic density between second-order inner retinal neurons and PRs within rescued retinal areas (synaptophysin; FIG. 9J), compared with adjoining degenerated areas.",

By cross section analysis, the density of PRs in mCherry+ regions from gRNATRGT treatment at P33 was 307\u00b182 PR nuclei/100 \u03bcm, or 9-fold greater than from gRNATRGT treatment (33\u00b13, nuclei/100 \u03bcm P<0.002), and was similarly higher when compared with comparable regions (non-fluorescent) of untreated control (27\u00b113 nuclei/100 \u03bcm, P<0.001). The density of PR nuclei was not different between gRNACNTRL and untreated groups (P>0.41) (FIG. 10B). Visual acuity assessed at P39 by optokinetic response (OKR) was 53% higher from gRNATRGT compared with that of gRNACNTRL treatment (0.185 versus 0.121 cycles/degree, respectively; FIG. 10C). By using the contralateral eye of individual animals as internal controls, visual acuity was 35% higher in the gRNATRGT-treated eye compared with the fellow eye in individual animals, whereas, gRNACNTRL-injection reduced visual acuity by 2.3% compared to the contralateral untreated eye (FIG. 10D).",

Pyogenes Cas9 transcript maybe too large (currently) to be packaged into AAV particles, delivered here via which necessitated in vivo electroporation or injection of plasmid DNA at postnatal day 0. The smaller transcript of the S. aureus Cas9 allows packaging into AAV particles for translational in vivo delivery at postnatal day 15. One approach is to rely on smaller SaCas9 constructs to be packaged into AAV particles in which the RhoS334ter transgene is targeted in S334ter-3 rats. Alternatively, if Cas9/gRNA cannot be delivered by electroporation or injection. Due to the size limitation of AAV particles (\u02dc4.7 kb), we propose to simultaneously inject two AAV vectors; AAV-Cas9 and AAV-gRNA with a fluorescent reporter as previously described.",

The decreased latency for endonuclease activity compared with plasmid expression will promote rapid gene editing in the fast degeneration S334ter rat model and minimize the potential for off-target cleavage events. Pre-assembled gRNA and Cas9 protein complexes (including a Nuclear Localization Sequence NLS) is commercially available as an injection-ready formulation, which we will test by subretinal injection. There is evidence supporting efficient transfection of exogenous proteins into eyes of adult rodents using a charged liposome (Pep1/Chariot, intracellular delivery of proteins into mouse M\u00fcller glia cells, Chariot\u2122 protein delivery reagent). Furthermore, as transcription and translation of plasmid DNA is unnecessary for the Cas9 protein after transfection, DNA cleavage begins within 2 hours, a time-frame faster than the current electroporation method (8 hrs). As this strategy precludes the use of fluorescent reporters, we will determine Cas9 distribution within the subretinal space by labeling Cas9 with FITC according to published protocols. Retinas will be imaged by live in vivo imaging using a Micron III to determine distribution and longevity of fluorescent signal. For some experiments, the Cas9/gRNA complex will be pre-combined with unconjugated mouse IgG2A antibody for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis.",

                                "These data collectively provide proof of principle for in vivo allele-specific ablation using CRISPR/Cas9 to prevent inherited retinal degeneration. The selective ablation of RhoS334 had prevented RHOS334 accumulation at PR cell bodies in the ONL and restored RHOWT trafficking to outer segments, which prevented retinal degeneration and preserved visual acuity. Eliminating RHOS334 expression generated blunt transition areas at which markedly preserved retinal areas adjoined those with advanced degeneration. These transition regions likely represent the physical extent to which gRNATRGT transfection had reached, as mCherry expression shared the same demarcation (FIG. 9A, and FIG. 9I, FIG. 9J). The observation that mCherry expression was not observed in all rescued PRs is likely attributable to the episomal nature of the plasmids and the reduced efficiency of the CMV promoter (driving mCherry) compared to that of Chicken \u00e2-Actin-derivative (driving Cas9). Thus, mCherry expression likely underestimated the total number of PRs in which Cas9/gRNATRGT was active and therefore the number of PRs in which the RhoS334 ablation-mediated rescue had occurred. This assertion is consistent with the S334ter-3 model, in which the expression of RhoS334 is exclusive to (rod) PRs and instigates cell-autonomous apoptotic signaling, suggesting that RhoS334 ablation is the only manner by which phenotypic rescue could have been achieved with gRNATRGT treatment. Furthermore, since PRs possess a single copy of the RhoS334 transgene, its ablation is absolute for conferring PR survivability. Whether this permanent genomic change confers long-term PR survival in a degenerative milieu will require sequential analysis of gRNATRGT-treated retinas. Toward this goal, PR loss was shown to be halted in an inducible transgenic model of autosomal recessive RP, even at advanced stages of degeneration. Furthermore, a translational proof-of-concept study using gene replacement in a canine model of X-lined RP demonstrated the feasibility of long-term arrest of PR loss.18 These studies support the possibility of long-term vision rescue following in vivo gene correction. With regard to visual function assessment, optomotor reflexes were significantly preserved from a single gRNATRGT treatment 39 days prior, compared with controls. Differences in visual function were not detected by electroretinography (ERG), however, ERG sensitivity is limited for detecting focal retinal activity and may not represent an appropriate test for the Inventors' experimental approach. Translational limitations of the current methods are technical in nature and greater functional improvement may be obtained through alternative methods to maximize retinal transfection and genetic correction. For example, the use of shorter Cas9 orthologs, such as Staphylococcus aureus (\u02dc3.3 kb) with short universal tRNA promotor21 will allow for efficient vector packaging into adeno-associated viral particles. Alternatively, direct delivery of Cas9 protein/gRNA complexes in vivo would also minimize the duration of endonuclease activity and therefore the risk for off-target cleavage events without compromising targeted cleavage efficiency, a critical consideration in the context of using genomic ablation as therapy.",
                                "The first in vivo functional correction of an inherited dominant mutation using CRISPR, shown here, provides proof-of-concept that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to treat inherited adRP. Selective-ablation of a dominant allele was achieved by targeting a PAM unique to the RhoS334 transgene, which differed from the RhoWT sequence by a single nucleotide. adRP-linked missense mutations that likewise create targetable monoallelic PAM sequences have been identified in patients (Table 1), who may thus represent the candidate population for ablation therapy to achieve phenotypic rescue. The challenge of generating targeted therapies for diseases with mutational heterogeneity may be addressed by altering the PAM specificity of Cas through rational-design engineering or by using non-canonical Cas enzymes. Such efforts may broaden the number of targetable mutations, and thereby expand the treatable pool of patients with degenerative diseases of the retina, and possibly other tissues.",
