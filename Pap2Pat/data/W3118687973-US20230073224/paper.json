    "title": "Universal Fast-Flux Control of a Coherent, Low-Frequency Qubit",
    "date": "2021-01-15",
    "abstract": "The textit{heavy-fluxonium} circuit is a promising building block for superconducting quantum processors due to its long relaxation and dephasing time at the half-flux frustration point. However, the suppressed charge matrix elements and low transition frequency have made it challenging to perform fast single-qubit gates using standard protocols. We report on new protocols for reset, fast coherent control, and readout, that allow high-quality operation of the qubit with a 14 MHz transition frequency, an order of magnitude lower in energy than the ambient thermal energy scale. We utilize higher levels of the fluxonium to initialize the qubit with $97$% fidelity, corresponding to cooling it to $190~mathrm{mu K}$. We realize high-fidelity control using a universal set of single-cycle flux gates, which are comprised of directly synthesizable fast pulses, while plasmon-assisted readout is used for measurements. On a qubit with $T_1, T_{2e}sim$~300~$mathrm{mu s}$, we realize single-qubit gates in $20-60$~ns with an average gate fidelity of $99.8%$ as characterized by randomized benchmarking.",

                "Superconducting circuits are among the fastest-developing candidates for quantum computers due to steady improvements in coherence times, gate fidelities, and processor size over the past two decades [1,2]. These developments have ushered the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era [3] and demonstrations of quantum advantage over classical computing [4]. Despite these significant improvements, decoherence still remains the central challenge for superconducting circuits. While the effects of environmental noise can be reduced by improving material properties [5][6][7], here, we develop an alternative approach in which we drastically reduce the noise spectral density by lowering the qubit frequency from gigahertz to megahertz. Despite the slowdown of all the relevant timescales, we still perform singlequbit gates at speeds that are comparable to the state of the art in conventional qubits. We develop ultrafast gates based on nonadiabatic Landau-Zener transitions [8][9][10][11][12] which act in less than a single Larmor period.",
                "We achieve this result by using a heavy-fluxonium circuit [13,14], whose rich level structure features a low qubit frequency (approximately 14 MHz) and excited levels that are several gigahertz away. The large frequency separation enables us to apply flux drives with amplitudes much larger than the qubit frequency, without any leakage outside of the computational subspace. The gap to the excited levels also exceeds the frequency scale set by the ambient temperature, allowing them to be used for initialization and readout of the qubit state. We develop a completely new set of protocols for operating the heavy fluxonium, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance that makes it the first serious competitor to the transmon qubit [15], with the potential for further improvements.",
                "The transmon, which underlies most modern superconducting quantum processors, is a weakly anharmonic oscillator with large dipole matrix elements. This circuit trades off increased sensitivity to decay and a reduced anharmonicity \u03b1 for decreased sensitivity to charge-noiseinduced dephasing. Despite the maximal susceptibility to relaxation, state-of-the-art transmons have depolarization (T 1 ) times around 100 \u03bcs [7,16,17], corresponding to quality factors Q of a few million. The gate speeds are, however, limited by the small anharmonicity, typically approximately 5% of the qubit frequency \u03c9 q , resulting in a theoretical upper bound for the gate infidelity of approximately \u03c9 q =\u00f0Q\u03b1\u00de \u223c 10 -5 and state-of-the-art values of \u22721-2 \u00d7 10 -4 [4] achieved with the derivative removal by adiabatic gate or other shaped pulses. This value suggests that gate infidelities can approach 1=Q by increasing the anharmonicity in comparison to qubit frequency and performing gate operations within a few Larmor periods.",
                "The flux qubit [18][19][20][21], another member of the superconducting circuit family, already has the desired level structure with a relative anharmonicity \u03b1=\u03c9 q \u226b 1. The extreme sensitivity to flux noise of these qubits is mitigated by shunting the Josephson junction with a large superinductor, resulting in the development of the fluxonium [22][23][24][25]. Further improvements in energy relaxation times were obtained by the realization of a heavy fluxonium [13,14], which additionally reduces the decay matrix elements using a large shunting capacitor. These variants of the fluxonium are reported to have longer coherence times than transmons in 3D architectures [26]. Even though the heavy fluxonium has the desired level structure and large coherence times, fast manipulation of the metastable qubit states remains a challenge due to the suppressed charge matrix elements. While Raman transitions can be used for coherent operations [13,27], these protocols are still relatively slow and require high drive powers while exposing the qubit to the higher loss rates of excited fluxonium levels involved during the gate. The requirement of fast coherent control, thus, encourages one to explore new schemes for implementing gates.",
                "In this work, we realize a heavy-fluxonium circuit in a 2D architecture with coherence times T 1 ; T 2e \u223c 300 \u03bcs exceeding those of standard transmons. The long coherence is achieved by accessing a new regime of low qubit frequency, which has the effect of slowing down all decoherence processes. Our circuit has a gap of only 14 MHz, an order of magnitude lower than the temperature of the surrounding bath. Therefore, we develop and realize a reset protocol that utilizes the readout resonator and higher circuit levels to initialize the qubit with 97% fidelity, effectively cooling the qubit down to 190 \u03bcK. Despite a frequency that is 300 times smaller, we develop an ultrafast-flux gate protocol that performs single-qubit gates at similar speeds to that of typical transmons."

            "paragraphs": [
                "Because of its low transition frequency, the qubit starts in a nearly evenly mixed state in thermal equilibrium. We first initialize the qubit in a pure state (jgi or jei) using the reset protocol shown in Fig. 2(a), similar to Refs. [28,29]. In this protocol, we simultaneously drive both the jg0i \u2192 jh0i and jh0i \u2192 je1i transitions for 15 \u03bcs. The high resonator frequency (5.7 GHz), in comparison to the physical temperature, and the low resonator quality factor Q \u00bc 600 result in the rapid loss of a photon from je1i, effectively removing the entropy from the qubit. In conjunction with the large matrix element between jh0i and je1i, this loss steers the system into a steady state with approximately 97% of the population settling in je0i in 15 \u03bcs (see the Appendix E). We subsequently perform an additional \u03c0 pulse on the jgi -jei transition to initialize the system in the ground state (jg0i). The reset is characterized by performing a Rabi rotation between the jei \u2194 jfi levels, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The Rabi contrast is doubled following reset, consistent with approximately 50% of the population being in jei in thermal equilibrium. If we prepare the system in jgi, the jei \u2194 jfi Rabi contrast indicates a 3 AE 2% error in state preparation, depending on the jfi state thermal population. Since the jfi frequency is similar to the typical transmon frequencies, its thermal population is in line with that of most transmons. The effective qubit temperature following reset is approximately 190 \u03bcK, lower than the ambient temperature by a factor of 100.",
                "Readout of the fluxonium levels is performed using circuit QED [30] by capacitively coupling the fluxonium circuit to a readout resonator [31]. Since the qubit states are far away in frequency from the readout resonator, the dispersive shift \u03c7 of the resonator due to a change in the occupation of computational states is small (60 kHz). Therefore, while the large detuning reduces the qubit heating through the resonator, it makes direct dispersive readout challenging. We circumvent this issue by utilizing the larger dispersive interactions \u03c7 f and \u03c7 h of the excited levels jfi and jhi, respectively, which are closer in frequency to the readout resonator. We thus perform a \u03c0 pulse on the jei -jfi transition in 80 ns, before standard dispersive readout. Since the population in jei is transferred to jfi, the readout signal becomes proportional to (\u03c7 f -\u03c7 g ), which is 5 times larger than (\u03c7 e -\u03c7 g ). A previously reported dispersive shift engineering technique [28] for fluxoniums tries to increase (\u03c7 e -\u03c7 g ), while our protocol uses state selective transfer and the dispersive shift between the excited plasmon states and the computational states for readout. This plasmon-assisted readout scheme results in 50% single-shot readout fidelity, which can be further improved with a parametric amplifier and by optimizing the resonator \u03ba and the dispersive shifts (see Appendix F)."

                "Having developed protocols for initialization and readout, we characterize the coherence properties of the qubit. Figure 3(a) shows the experimentally measured T 1 (black circles) as a function of the applied external flux, while the inset shows T 1 \u00bc 315 AE 10 \u03bcs measured at the fluxfrustration point (\u22c6) following initialization of the qubit in either the jgi or the jei state. The qubit relaxes to a near-equal mixture where the excited state population P\u00f0jei\u00de \u00bc 0.4955 AE 0.0015, with the deviation providing an estimate of the temperature of the surrounding bath, T \u00bc 42 AE 14 mK. At the flux-frustration point, the wave functions are delocalized into symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the states in each well. As we move away from this degeneracy point, the wave functions localize into different wells, resulting in a suppression of tunneling and an increase in the relaxation times; see Fig. 3(a). Here, the qubit relaxation times are measured over a wide range of external flux by driving the jgi -jhi transition for 120 \u03bcs (5 times the jhi state T 1 ) to ensure most of the population reside in the jei state and monitoring the subsequent decay. While moving away from the flux-frustration point, T 1 increases to a maximum value of 4.3 AE 0.2 ms, consistent with previous heavy-fluxonium devices [13,26], before subsequently decreasing.",
                "To explain the measured relaxation times, we consider several avenues by which the qubit can decay, including Purcell loss, decay via charge and flux coupling to the control lines, 1=f flux noise, dielectric loss in the capacitor, and resistive loss in the superinductor. Conservative estimates of the flux-noise-induced loss are lower than the measured loss by nearly an order of magnitude (see Appendix G). The loss near the flux-frustration point is believed to be largely due to dielectric loss in the capacitor. This loss can be thought of as Johnson-Nyquist current noise from the resistive part of the shunting capacitor, which couples to the phase matrix element hgj \u03c6jei and grows rapidly as we approach the flux-frustration point [26]. Assuming a fixed loss tangent for the capacitor, this loss rate is inversely proportional to the impedance of the capacitor and is given by",
                "The T 1 at the flux-frustration point sets an upper bound of 1=Q cap \u00bc 4 \u00d7 10 -6 for the loss tangent of the capacitor, which is within a factor of 2 of the value reported in previous heavy-fluxonium devices [26], and results in the dashed red curve in Fig. 3(a). Since \u03c9 q is below the ambient temperature near the flux-frustration point, a combination of the temperature-dependent prefactor \u223c2k B T=\u00f0\u210f\u03c9 q \u00de and the relation between charge and phase matrix elements in fluxonium, hgj njei \u00bc \u03c9 q =\u00f08E c \u00dehgj \u03c6jei, results in the dielectric-loss scaling as 1=\u03c9 q , which is consistent with the observed trend in the T 1 near the flux-frustration point.",
                "The measured T 1 at the flux-frustration point also sets an upper bound of 1.7 \u00d7 10 -9 for the loss tangent of the inductor. The decay from inductive loss, however, increases more rapidly with frequency than dielectric loss (\u221d 1=\u03c9 3 q ) and is inconsistent with measured data. Our qubit operations are performed between 0.4\u03a6 0 and 0.5\u03a6 0 , where the T 1 is mainly limited by dielectric loss. As we move further away from the flux-frustration point (approximately 0.4\u03a6 0 ), T 1 starts to decrease. This additional loss is believed to be due to a combination of radiative loss to the charge drive line and Purcell loss from higher fluxonium levels excited by heating from the jgi and jei states. The Purcell loss calculated based on the coupled fluxonium-resonator system using a bath temperature of 60 mK results in the dotted blue curve shown in Fig. 3(a).",
                "This result is slightly higher than the temperature inferred from the qubit thermal steady state population and can be attributed to the fact that the noise environments could be significantly different at frequencies that are more than 2 orders of magnitude apart. The enhanced loss near \u03a6 ext \u00bc 0.35\u03a6 0 is suggestive that heating to higher levels may contribute, as there are several near resonances of higher fluxonium levels with the readout resonator, which depend sensitively on the circuit parameters (see Appendix G).",
                "The dephasing is characterized using a Ramsey sequence with three echo \u03c0 pulses and found to be minimized at \u03a6 ext \u00bc \u03a6 0 =2, where the qubit frequency is first-order insensitive to changes in flux. The dephasing rate near the flux-frustration point can be separated into two parts. The first is a frequency-independent term \u0393 C mainly composed of qubit depolarization and dephasing from cavity photon shot noise and other flux-insensitive white noise sources. The second arises from 1=f flux noise that is proportional to the flux slope as",
                ", where \u03b7 is in the flux-noise amplitude and W depends on the number of \u03c0 pulses in an echo experiment (W \u00bc 4 ln 2 -9 4 ln 3 for three \u03c0 pulses [32]). Thus, our spin-echo signal decays as exp\u00f0-t=T C \u00de \u00d7 exp\u00f0-\u0393 2 1=f t 2 \u00de. Here, T C \u00bc 1=\u0393 C is the T 2e value at the flux-frustration point. It is found to be approximately 300 \u03bcs, much higher than the T 2e values for state-of-the-art transmons; see the inset in Fig. 3(b). The T \u00c3 2 is found to be approximately 70-100 \u03bcs (Fig. 9 in Appendix H), indicating that the dephasing is limited by low-frequency flux noise (see Appendix H). The T 2e values around the flux-frustration point, defined as the time for the echo oscillation amplitude to decay to 1=e, are shown in Fig. 3(b). This value falls off rapidly as we move away from the flux-frustration point, consistent with the small tunnel coupling between levels. Away from the flux-frustration point, T 2e is mainly limited by 1=f flux noise. The T 2e far from the frustration point is projected to be approximately 10 \u03bcs according to our model, which is consistent with other reported results [26]."

We instead control the qubit through fast-flux pulses and report the first use of nonadiabatic Landau-Zener transitions to realize ultrafast gates that occur within a single Larmor period.

                "Figure 4(a) shows the protocol for a generic qubit pulse. We first rapidly move the flux-bias point away from the flux-frustration point in one direction and back, thus generating a rotation about the x axis through a large \u03c3 x term in our computational basis. There is additionally a relatively small rotation about the z axis corresponding to the time \u0394t p of the triangular spike. We subsequently idle at the flux-frustration point for a duration \u0394t z , which results in a rotation by \u03c9 q \u0394t z about the z axis. Finally, we rapidly move the flux-bias point in the other direction and back, resulting in a -\u03c3 x term and another small z rotation. We choose the two spikes to be exactly antisymmetric, ensuring zero net flux, simultaneously minimizing the effect of microsecond and millisecond pulse distortions ubiquitous in flux-bias lines [33], and echoing out low-frequency noise. The pulse is also immune to shape distortions, since the total \u03c3 x and \u03c3 z amplitudes depend only on the area of the spike and \u0394t z . By sweeping the amplitude A of the triangular spike and idling length \u0394t z of the pulse and measuring the expectation value of the spin along each axis, we obtain the 2D Rabi patterns shown in Fig. 4(c) that provide a measure of our gate parameters. A vertical line cut of these graphs corresponds to Larmor precession in the lab frame, with an oscillation frequency of \u0394 \u00bc 14 MHz.

Our control scheme has dramatically improved the single-qubit gate speed of fluxonium qubits, making them a viable candidate for large-scale superconducting quantum computation. The gate pulses can be directly synthesized with inexpensive digital-to-analog converters and are insensitive to shape distortions. Furthermore, they are broadly applicable to any system which can be driven nonadiabatically, including other low-frequency qubits, protected qubits, and interactions between qubits.",

This generalization would allow for two-qubit gate operations that are as fast as the single-qubit gates demonstrated in this work, without involving the participation of the more lossy excited levels. Despite minimal optimization, we have realized a qubit with state-of-the-art gate fidelities and one of the longest reported coherence times in superconducting circuits. The readout and reset can also be improved by leveraging methods that have been demonstrated in other devices [39,40].
