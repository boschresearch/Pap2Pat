    "abstract": "Methods for initializing a qubit into a pure state, reading the qubit, and arbitrarily rotating the qubit into any quantum state complete in times shorter than the qubit's typical dephasing and relaxation times. These methods provide universal single-qubit control and may be used to implement quantum gates with high fidelity. The methods may be implemented with superconducting qubits, such as heavy fluxonium, and do not rely on a three-dimensional cavity for suppressing spontaneous emission. Therefore, the methods may be implemented using smaller two-dimensional architectures commonly used for superconducting circuits. The methods also work with low-frequency qubits, i.e., qubits for which the energy spacing between the two quantum-computational states is less than the mean thermal energy of a surrounding bath. This reduces the cooling requirements of the qubit while maintaining fidelity.",

                        "Many prior-art superconducting quantum processors implement qubits as transmons, whose coherence times have improved by nearly an order of magnitude due to new methods that decrease the effects of environmental noise. One of the simplest of superconducting circuits, a transmon can be modeled as a weakly anharmonic oscillator whose energy states are joined via large transition dipole matrix elements. Transmons trade off decreased sensitivity to charge-induced-noise dephasing with increased sensitivity to decay.",
                        "Flux qubits, and in particular fluxonium, are promising types of superconducting circuits that offer many advantages over transmons. Some of the benefits of fluxonium include a rich energy-level structure, natural protection from charge-noise-induced relaxation and dephasing, and compatibility with circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED).",
                        "Fluxonium is created by shunting a flux qubit with a large inductance. Further shunting of the qubit with a large capacitance results in \u201cheavy fluxonium\u201d, which advantageously increases relaxation times. However, a challenge with using flux qubits in large-scale superconducting processors is that standard microwave control techniques result in slow gates that cannot complete before dephasing and relaxation take effect.",
                        "The present embodiments include fast methods for controlling superconducting qubits, and therefore may be used with superconducting quantum computers (e.g., those based on fluxonium qubits). Here, \u201cfast\u201d means that the methods complete in times much shorter than typical dephasing and relaxation times, and thus high fidelities (e.g., 99%) can be reliably achieved. Advantageously, these methods do not rely on a three-dimensional (3D) cavity for suppressing spontaneous emission, and therefore can be implemented using smaller two-dimensional (2D) architectures commonly used for superconducting circuits. The present embodiments include methods for initializing a superconducting qubit into a pure state (e.g., at the beginning of a quantum gate) and methods for reading-out the quantum state of the superconducting qubit (e.g., at the end of the quantum gate). Finally, the present embodiments also include methods based on fast pulses for arbitrarily rotating a single superconducting qubit into any quantum state, thereby providing universal single-qubit control.",
                        "Advantageously, the present embodiments can work when the energy spacing between the two quantum-computational states of the qubit is less than the equivalent mean thermal energy of a surrounding bath. Prior-art superconducting qubits are challenged by small energy spacings because the resulting thermal occupation of both quantum-computational states reduces fidelity. By overcoming the limitations of this thermal occupation, the present embodiments relieve the requirements for cryogenic cooling (i.e., the qubit does not need to be cooled to temperatures as low as those used in the prior art, while maintaining fidelity).",
                        "For clarity in the following discussion, examples are described with respect to fluxonium qubits. However, it should be appreciated that the present embodiments may be used with any kind of flux qubit, i.e., a \u201cheavy\u201d flux qubit, a \u201clight\u201d flux qubit, or any other type of qubit whose properties are controllable with an applied magnetic flux. Furthermore, the present embodiments may also be used with another type of qubit without departing from the scope hereof. For example, the present embodiments can be implemented with a charge qubit (e.g., a cooper pair box). The present embodiments can also be implemented with a qubit containing a voltage-controllable Josephson junction (e.g., a gatemon qubit, or flux-like qubits where the Josephson junction is voltage-controlled)."

The fluxonium qubit 120 is an example of heavy fluxonium in which a small-area Josephson junction 122 with inductance LJ is shunted by a capacitor 124 with capacitance Cq. The fluxonium qubit 120 also includes a superinductor 126 formed from an array of large-area Josephson junctions that shunts the Josephson junction 122 with an inductance LJA. The superinductor 126 has a total Josephson energy EJA that is much larger than a total charging energy ECA of the superinductor 126 (i.e., EJA>>ECA) to ensure that charge dispersion for each junction of the superinductor 126 is small, and thus that the superinductor 126 serves only as an inductor.",

An inductance LR of the readout inductor 112, and a parallel capacitance CR of the readout capacitors 114, 116, are selected such that the readout resonator 110 has a resonant frequency that is high compared to a temperature of an environment in which the quantum system 100 is located and operates. For example, the quantum system 100 may be mounted inside of a cryostat that cools the quantum system 100 to a temperature less than 50 mK. At 10 mK, the peak of the blackbody spectrum occurs near 600 MHz (as estimated using Wien's displacement law). Accordingly, the resonant frequency of the readout resonator 110 should be made higher than this value (e.g., 5 GHz, or more) to minimize excitation of the readout resonator 110 by thermal background photons. At temperatures less than 10 mK, the resonant frequency of the readout resonator 110 may be reduced accordingly.",

Each of the microwave transmission lines 140 and 142 may be a coaxial transmission line, or a planar transmission line (e.g., microstrip) co-fabricated with the quantum system 100 on a common substrate. The quantum system 100 may be alternatively or additionally coupled to one or more other superconducting quantum components (e.g., one or more additional resonators 110, one or more additional fluxonium qubits 120, one or more other additional superconducting qubits of another type, etc.).",

The potential energy 202, corresponding to the second and third terms on the right-hand side of Eqn. 1, exhibit a pair of potential-energy wells near \u00b1\u03c0. The fluxonium qubit 120 has a ground state |g with a ground-state wavefunction 210 and a ground-state energy Eg, a first excited state |e with a first excited-state wavefunction 212 and a first excited-state energy Ee, a second excited state |f with a second excited-state wavefunction 214 and a second excited-state energy Ef, and a third excited state |h with a third excited-state wavefunction 216 and a third excited-state energy Eh. Each of the states |g, |e, |f, and |h is an energy eigenstate of the Hamiltonian Hf of Eqn. 1.",
                        "Quantum computation with the fluxonium qubit 120 may be implemented with the ground state |g and the first excited state |e. These states are also referred to herein as the quantum-computational states |g and |e. Tunneling through a center peak 218 of the potential energy 202 removes a degeneracy between these two states, resulting in an energy spacing \u03941=Ee\u2212Eg. In the example of FIG. 2, \u03941 is only 14 MHz, much less than the frequency of the environmental temperature. To achieve such a small value for \u03941 (i.e., weak tunneling through the center peak 218), the height of the center peak 218 can be made large by selecting the ratio EJ/EC to be greater than one. In the example of FIG. 2, EJ/EC\u22487. However, the fluxonium qubit 120 can be configured with a ratio EJ/EC that is even larger, wherein \u03941 decreases accordingly. Alternatively, the fluxonium qubit 120 can be configured with a smaller ratio EJ/EC without departing from the scope hereof. Alternatively, the fluxonium qubit 120 can be configured with an additional Josephson junction that allows EJ/EC to be electronically controlled.",
                        "Associated with small values of \u03941 is a suppression of transitions between the states |g and |e. That is, the transition dipole between the states |g and |e is nearly zero. Accordingly, the first excited state |e is metastable, which can be seen in FIG. 1 by the fact that the overlap of the wavefunctions 210 and 212, when integrated over all values of \u03c6, is small. Transitions between |e and |g are fluxon-like inter-well transitions. Accordingly, the first excited state |e is also referred to herein as the metastable fluxon state |e.",
                        "Each of the two potential-energy wells in FIG. 2 is deep enough to support an additional eigenstate, shown in FIG. 2 as the second and third excited states |f and |h. Transitions between the ground state |g and the third excited state |h are intra-well transitions that are plasmon-like. Transitions between the first excited state |e and the second excited state |f are also plasmon-like. Unlike the suppressed fluxon transitions between the states |g and |e, each of these plasmon-like transitions is strong, and thus can be readily driven via applied microwave fields. As shown in FIG. 2, an energy spacing \u03942=Ef\u2212Ee between the second excited state |f and the first excited state |e is larger than \u03941. Similarly, an energy spacing \u03943\u00d7Eh\u2212Ef between the third excited state |h and the second excited state |f is greater than \u03941 due to the increasing tunneling between these states near the top of the center peak 218. Nevertheless, \u03943 is still less than \u03942. In the example of FIG. 2, \u03942 is 2974 MHz and \u03943 is 194 MHz. Accordingly, the second excited state |f is also referred to herein as the first plasmon excited state |f, and the third excited state |h is also referred to herein as the second plasmon excited state |h.",

In FIG. 3, each energy eigenstate of the quantum system 100 is a composite (i.e., tensor product) of one of the energy eigenstates of the fluxonium qubit 120 (i.e., one of the states |g, |e, |f, and |h) and a quantum state of the resonator 110 characterized by a number of photons in the resonator 110. Accordingly, FIG. 3 shows a composite state |g0 in which the fluxonium qubit 120 is in the ground state |g and there are no photons in the resonator 110. Similarly, FIG. 3 shows a composite state |e0 in which the fluxonium qubit 120 is in the first excited state |e and there are no photons in the resonator 110. FIG. 3 also shows composite states |f0 and |h0, which may be interpreted similarly.",

The resonator 110 has a relatively low Q (e.g., less than 1000) and thus, when the quantum system 100 is in the state |e1, the resonator 110 will rapidly decay, emitting a spontaneous photon 306 that leaves the quantum system 100 in the state |e0. Note that the quantum system 100, when in the state |e1, is highly unlikely to decay to the state |g0 since such a decay involves a fluxon-like transition for the fluxonium qubit 120. As described above, such fluxon-like transitions are highly suppressed.",
                        "While FIG. 1 shows the fluxonium qubit 120 coupled to the readout resonator 110, the fluxonium qubit 120 may be alternatively coupled to another type of energy-dissipating device that couples the energy of the spontaneous photon 306 into a surrounding cold bath to reduce the entropy of the fluxonium qubit 120. Other examples of such energy dissipaters include 3D microwave cavities and microwave transmission lines.",
                        "FIG. 3 also illustrates a reset method for initializing the quantum system 100 into a pure state. Since the quantum system 100 resides in an environment whose temperature is large compared to \u03941, yet smaller than \u03942, the fluxonium qubit 120, when thermally equilibrated with environment, will be in a nearly evenly mixed state (i.e., a nearly even statistical ensemble of the pure states |g and |e). Advantageously, the reset method described here transfers the fluxonium qubit 120 from the mixed state into a pure state (i.e., either one of the states |g and |e) that can be subsequently controlled to prepare the fluxonium qubit 120, with high fidelity, in whatever state is needed (as based on the quantum algorithm or gate at hand). Thus, the reset method may be used as a first step for universal single-qubit control.",
                        "The initial mixed state of the fluxonium qubit 120 can be described as an ensemble whose density matrix operator has the form \u03c1=pq|gg|+pe|ee|, where pg is the fraction of the ensemble in the state |g and pe is the fraction of the ensemble in the state |e. Thus, the operator \u03c1 has a g-term and an e-term. As shown in FIG. 3, the quantum system 100 may be driven with a first microwave field 302 that couples the states |g0 and |h0. For example, a frequency of the first microwave field 302 may be selected to be resonant with the transition between the states |g0 and |h0. The first microwave field 302 excites the fraction pg of the ensemble in the state |g to the state |h, while leaving the fraction pe of the ensemble in the state |e undisturbed.",
                        "Also shown in FIG. 3, the quantum system 100 may also be driven with a second microwave field 304 that couples the states |h0 and |e1. For example, a frequency of the first microwave field 302 may be selected to be resonant with the transition between the states |h0 and |e1. The microwave fields 302 and 304 may be applied simultaneously. The second microwave field 304 excites the fraction pg of the ensemble previously transferred to the state |h0 up to the state |e1. Once excited, the fraction rapidly decays into the |e0 state by emitting the spontaneous photon 306. After the decay, all the ensemble is in the |e state of the fluxonium qubit 120, and thus the quantum system 100 is in a pure state. A third microwave field 310 may be subsequently applied to transfer the quantum system 100 into the pure state |g0. For example, the third microwave field 310 may be a \u03c0 pulse that coherently transfers the quantum system 100 from the pure state |e0 into the pure state |g0.",
                        "A first speed with which the first microwave field 302 excites the fraction pg from the state |g0 to the state |h0 depends on a first Rabi frequency that is equal to the product of an amplitude of the first microwave field 302 and a transition dipole moment between the states |g0 and |h0. Similarly, a second speed with which the second microwave field 304 excites the fraction pg from the state |h0 to the state let) depends on a second Rabi frequency that is equal to the product of an amplitude of the second microwave field 304 and a transition dipole moment between the states |h0 and |e1. Thus, the amplitudes of the microwave field 302, 304 may be chosen such that the fraction pg is excited to the state |e1, and subsequently decays to the state |e0, in a time that is short compared to both a relaxation time T1 and a dephasing time T2 of the fluxonium qubit 120 (see experimental demonstration below). By contrast, the reset method was experimentally demonstrated by applying the microwave fields 302 and 304 to the fluxonium qubit 120 for 15 \u03bcs, followed by a 10 \u03bcs waiting period (i.e., in the absence of the microwave fields 302 and 304) to allow the spontaneous photon 306 to be emitted. A \u03c0 pulse was the applied, after which a fidelity of 99% was obtained (i.e., 99% of the ensemble was in the state |g0, with the remaining 1% of the ensemble in other states). The corresponding temperature of the fluxonium qubit 120 was only 0.145 mK, lower than the ambient temperature by a factor of 100. Since it is experimentally challenging to produce a perfectly pure state, the reset method is described herein as generating an \u201capproximately\u201d pure state.",
                        "It is assumed in the previous discussion that the loop 132 of the fluxonium qubit 120 is continuously threaded by the external magnetic flux 130 during the entire reset method (and subsequent \u03c0 pulse, if included), as the external magnetic flux 130 is needed to generate the energy-level structure shown in FIG. 3. While the above discussion describes the reset method with respect to the fluxonium qubit 120, those trained in the art will recognize that the reset method can be applied to another type of qubit, provided that the qubit has, or includes, a similar energy-level structure to that shown in FIG. 3. Thus, the reset method is not limited to fluxonium qubits, but may be used with other types of flux qubits, other types of superconducting-circuit qubits (e.g., phase qubits), and even non-superconducting-circuit qubits (e.g., ions, atoms, nitrogen-vacancy centers, etc.). In some of these other types of qubits, one or more of the microwave fields 302, 304, and 308 may need to be replaced with an oscillating electromagnetic field in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., infrared, visible, ultraviolet, etc.).",
                        "FIG. 3 also illustrates a readout method for distinguishing between the quantum-computational states |g and |e of the fluxonium qubit 120. The fluxonium qubit 120, when coupled with the readout resonator 110, dispersively shifts the resonant frequency of the readout resonator 110 by an amount that depends on the state (i.e., |g or |e) of the fluxonium qubit 120. Thus, the fluxonium qubit 120 induces, in the readout resonator 110, a first dispersive frequency shift when in the |g state, and a second dispersive frequency shift when in the |e state. A differential shift, equal to the different between the first and second dispersive frequency shifts, increases as the energies of the states |g and |e approach that of the excited resonator 110 (i.e., as the energies of the states |g0 and |e0 increase toward the energy of the state |e1).",
                        "For the quantum system 100, the energy gap between each of the lower-energy states |g0 and |e0, and the excited state |e1 is so large that the differential shift is too small to discern between the states |g0 and |e0. To enhance the interaction with the readout resonator 110, a \u03c0 pulse 308 may be applied between the states |e0 and |f0, as part of the readout method, to coherently transfer the population of the state |e0 into the state |f0. The goal of discerning between the states |g0 and |e0 is now implemented by discerning between the states |g0 and |f0. Since the energy of the state |f0 is closer to that of the excited state |e1, the second dispersive frequency shift increases. This, in turn, increases the differential shift, making it easier to discern between the states |g0 and |f0 using dispersive readout via the readout resonator 110. The \u03c0 pulse 308 may be alternatively configured to coherently transfer the population in the state |g0 state to the state |h0, wherein the readout resonator 110 is used to discern between the states |e0 and |h0.",
                        "One advantage of the readout method described above is that quantum computation is performed in the states |g0 and |e0, which benefits from the large detunings to the lowest excited states of the resonator 110. Thus, during quantum computation, heating of the fluxonium qubit 120 due to coupling with the resonator 110 is minimized, helping to preserve the long relaxation and dephasing times.",

However, the external magnetic flux 130 may be changed during the readout method. For example, a first magnetic flux 130 may be applied prior to and/or during the \u03c0 pulse 308. Afterwards, a second magnetic flux 130 (with a magnitude different than that of the first magnetic flux 130) may be applied during sequent dispersive readout via the readout resonator 110.",

In some of these other types of qubits, one or more of the microwave fields 302, 304, and 308 may need to be replaced with an oscillating electromagnetic field in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., infrared, visible, ultraviolet, etc.).",

The fluxonium qubit 120 may begin (i.e., before an initial time t1) in any qubit state, i.e., any linear combination of the quantum-computational states |g and |e. The fluxonium qubit 112 is continuously threaded with externally generated magnetic flux 130 at a nominal value. Starting at the initial time t1, and lasting until a second time t2=t1+\u0394t, the pulse 402 is applied to the fluxonium qubit 120 by deviating the magnetic flux \u03a6 away from the nominal value. In the example of FIG. 4, the magnetic flux \u03a6 is increased above the nominal value by a pulse amplitude A. The value \u0394t is a pulse duration of the pulse 402. While FIG. 4 shows the magnetic flux \u03a6 returning to the same nominal value after the pulse 402 (i.e., starting at time t2), the magnetic flux \u03a6 may return to a different nominal value than that before the pulse 402 (i.e., prior to time t1).",

The Larmor frequency \u03c9q is given by the energy splitting of the states |g and |e when the magnetic flux \u03a6 is at the nominal value \u03a60/2. In the experimental results presented below, \u03c9q=14 MHz, corresponding to a Larmor period of 71 ns. A pulse duration \u0394t of approximately 2 ns was successfully demonstrated, more than an order of magnitude less than the Larmor period. In one embodiment, the pulse duration \u0394t is less than one-fourth of the Larmor period.",

Due to the finite value of the pulse duration \u0394t, the pulse 402 also rotates the Bloch vector about the z axis of the Bloch sphere, albeit at a slower rate than rotation about the x axis. The symbol \u0394 denotes the ratio of the rotation rate about the z axis to the rotation rate about the x axis, where only \u03bb\u22641 is considered herein. Thus, the pulse 402 rotates the Bloch vector about the z axis by \u03bb|\u03b8|, which is less than the angle \u03b8 by the factor \u03bb. To minimize the rotation of the Bloch vector about the z axis, the pulse duration \u0394t should be made as short as possible.",

As the magnetic flux \u03a6 deviates from the nominal value \u03a60/2, the pulse 402 effectively acts as a transverse magnetic field that couples the states |g and |e, thereby increasing their energy splitting as the instantaneous flux \u03a6 increasingly deviates away from the nominal value \u03a60/2 (see FIG. 11B). The energy splitting will achieve a maximum energy splitting at the peak of the pulse 402. In one embodiment, the amplitude A is selected such that the maximum energy splitting is at least twice the nominal energy splitting.",

In fact, FIG. 9A shows that the relaxation time T1 of the fluxonium qubit 120 is smallest for magnetic fluxes near \u03a60/2. Accordingly, it may be advantageous to operate at magnetic fluxes away from \u03a60/2. Operation at a magnetic flux away from \u03a60/2 will decrease the dephasing time T2, which is largest at \u03a60/2 (see FIG. 9B). However, the increase in T1 may be greater than the reduction in T2, giving rise to an optimal magnetic flux at which the coherence properties of the fluxonium qubit 120 are overall maximized.",

However, the pulse 402 may have any other shape without departing from the scope hereof. For example, the pulse 402 may have a \u201csimple\u201d shape that monotonically deviates away from the nominal value \u03a60/2 to a maximum deviation (either greater than or less than the nominal value), and then monotonically deviates from the maximum deviation back toward from the nominal value \u03a60/2. The triangular pulse 402 shown in FIG. 4 is one example of a simple pulse shape that has no plateau (i.e., the pulse 402 does not \u201cdwell\u201d at any value of the flux). However, the pulse 402 may alternatively include one or more plateaus. The pulse may deviate linearly (e.g., rectangular, trapezoidal, triangular with unmatched rising and falling edges, etc.) or nonlinearly (e.g., Gaussian, Lorentzian, etc.). Alternatively, the pulse 402 may have a \u201ccomplex\u201d shape that changes slope any number of times, with or without one or more plateaus, before returning to the nominal value \u03a60/2. For example, the pulse 402 may also cross the nominal value \u03a60/2 one or more times before returning to the nominal value \u03a60/2.",

To increase stability, a DC power supply can be used to continuously output a DC current that generates the magnetic flux 130 at the nominal value. The DAC output may then be AC-coupled to the DC current such that the pulses 402 deviate the magnetic flux from the nominal value. Commercial DACs operate at speeds greater than 10 Gbps, and therefore can achieve pulse durations \u0394t less than 1 ns.",

In the example of FIG. 5, the magnetic flux \u03a6 is increased above the nominal value \u03a60/2 by a first pulse amplitude A1.

                                "Superconducting circuits are among the fastest developing candidates for quantum computers due to steady improvements in coherence times, gate fidelities, and processor size. These developments have ushered the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era and demonstrations of quantum advantage over classical computing. Many superconducting quantum processors are based on the transmon circuit, which since its inception has seen improvements in coherence by nearly 4-5 orders of magnitude driven largely by decreasing environmental noise. While the transmon circuit has seen widespread use in quantum computation, fluxonium offers many advantages over earlier flux qubits, including a rich level structure, natural protection from charge-noise induced relaxation and dephasing, and reduced sensitivity to flux noise. One of the challenges in making fluxonium a building block for superconducting qubit processors arises from the slow gates using standard microwave control.",
                                "In this section, we demonstrate high-fidelity control of a fluxonium circuit using a universal set of single-cycle flux gates on a qubit whose frequency is an order of magnitude lower than the ambient temperature. In the process, we reimagine all aspects of how the circuit should be controlled and operated, and demonstrate coherence times and gate fidelities that match or exceed those of the best transmon circuits, with the potential for further improvements.",
                                "The transmon is one of the simplest in the family of superconducting circuits, realizing a weakly anharmonic oscillator with large dipole matrix elements. This circuit trades off increased sensitivity to decay, and a reduced anharmonicity for decreased sensitivity to charge-noise-induced dephasing. Despite the maximal susceptibility to relaxation, state-of-the-art transmons have relaxation (T1) times around 100 \u03bcs, corresponding to Qs of a few million. The gate speeds are, however, limited by the small anharmonicity, typically \u02dc5% of the qubit frequency \u03c9q, resulting in a theoretical upper bound of \u02dc\u03c9q/(Q\u03b1)\u02dc10\u22125 and state-of-the-art values of \u22721-2\u00d710\u22124 for the gate infidelity. This suggests that gate fidelities can be made to approach 1/Q by increasing the anharmonicity in comparison to the qubit frequency \u03c9q, and performing gate operations within a few Larmor periods.",
                                "The flux qubit, another member of the superconducting circuit family, already has the desired level structure with a relative anharmonicity \u03b1/\u03c9q>>1. The extreme sensitivity to flux noise of these qubits was mitigated by shunting the Josephson junction with a large superinductor, resulting in the development of the fluxonium. Further improvements in energy relaxation times were obtained by the realization of a heavy fluxonium, which additionally reduced the decay matrix elements using a large shunting capacitor. These variants of fluxonium are reported to have longer coherence times than transmons in 3D architectures. Even though heavy fluxonium has the desired level structure and large coherence times, fast manipulation of the metastable qubit states remains a challenge due to the suppressed charge matrix elements. While Raman transitions can be used for coherent operations, these protocols are still relatively slow and require high drive powers, while exposing the qubit to the higher loss rates of excited fluxonium levels involved during the gate.",

The frequency of the qubit transition is only 14 MHz, an order of magnitude lower than the temperature of the surrounding bath. Therefore, to initialize the qubit we develop and realize a reset protocol that utilizes the readout resonator and higher circuit levels to initialize the qubit with 97% fidelity, effectively cooling the qubit down to 190 \u03bcK. Lastly, we use flux pulses to realize high-fidelity single-qubit gates within a single period 2\u03c0/\u03c9q of the Larmor oscillation.",

The shunting inductance is realized by an array of 300 large-area JJs, each having a Josephson energy EJA and charging energy ECA. We make EJA/ECA>>1 to ensure that the charge dispersion for each array junctions is small, and the array can be regarded as a linear inductor. The corresponding effective circuit is shown in FIG. 7B, and the resulting Hamiltonian is given by Eqn. 1. The corresponding values for the reported device are: EC/h=0.479 GHz, EL/h=0.132 GHz, and EJ/h=3.395 GHz, where h is Planck's constant. The level structure of the fluxonium at the flux-frustration point (\u03a6ext=\u03a60/2) is shown in FIG. 7C. There are two types of transitions of interest, the intra-well plasmons (|g\u2194h and |e\u2194|f) and the inter-well fluxons (|g\u2194|e and |f\u2194|h). The single-photon transitions |g\u2194|f and |e\u2194|h are forbidden at the flux-frustration point due to the parity selection rule.

                                "Due to its low transition frequency, the qubit starts in a nearly evenly-mixed state in thermal equilibrium. We first initialize the qubit in a pure state (|g or |e) using the reset protocol shown in FIG. 8A. In this protocol, we simultaneously drive both the |g0\u2192|h0 and |h0\u2192|e1 transitions for 15 \u03bcs. The high resonator frequency (5.7 GHz) in comparison to the physical temperature, and the low resonator quality factor Q=600 result in the rapid loss of a photon from |e1, effectively removing the entropy from the qubit. In conjunction with the large matrix element between |h0 and |e1, this steers the system into a steady state with over 95% of the population settling in |e0 in 5 \u03bcs. We subsequently perform an additional \u03c0 pulse on the |g-|e transition to initialize the system in the ground state (|g0). The reset is characterized by performing a Rabi rotation between the |e \u2194|f levels, as shown in FIG. 2(b). The Rabi contrast is doubled following reset, consistent with 50% of the population being in |e in thermal equilibrium. If we prepare the system in |g, the |e \u03c7|f Rabi contrast indicates a 3\u00b12% error in state preparation, depending on the |f state thermal population. Since the |f frequency is similar to the typical transmon frequencies, its thermal population is in line with that of most transmons. The effective qubit temperature following reset is \u02dc190 \u03bcK, lower than the ambient temperature by a factor of 100.",
                                "Readout of the fluxonium levels is performed using circuit quantum electrodynamics by capacitively coupling the fluxonium circuit to a readout resonator. Since the qubit states are far away in frequency from the readout resonator, the dispersive shift x of the resonator due to a change in the occupation of computational states is small (60 kHz). While the large detuning reduces the qubit heating through the resonator, it makes direct dispersive readout challenging. We circumvent this issue by utilizing the larger dispersive interactions \u03c7f, \u03c7h of the excited levels |f, |h, which are closer in frequency to the readout resonator. To improve readout fidelity, we thus perform a \u03c0 pulse on the |e-|f transition in 80 ns, before standard dispersive readout. Since the population in |e is transferred to |f, the readout signal becomes proportional to (\u03c7f-\u03c7g), which is five times larger than (\u03c7e-\u03c7g). This plasmon-assisted readout scheme results in 50% single-shot readout fidelity, which can be further improved with a parametric amplifier, and by optimizing the resonator K and the dispersive shifts.",

The inset of FIG. 9A shows a T1=315\u00b110 pts measured at the flux-frustration point following initialization of the qubit in either the |g or |e state. The qubit relaxes to a near equal mixture where the excited state population P(|e)=0.4955\u00b10.0015, with the deviation providing an estimate of the temperature of the surrounding bath, T=42\u00b114 mK. At the flux-frustration point, the wavefunctions are delocalized into symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations of the states in each well. As we move away from this degeneracy point, the wavefunctions localize into different wells resulting in a suppression of tunneling and an increase in the relaxation times, see FIG. 9A. Here, the qubit relaxation times were measured over a wide range of external flux by driving the |g-|h transition for 120 \u03bcs to pump the qubit into the |e state, and monitoring the subsequent decay. While moving away from the flux-frustration point, T1 increases to a maximum value of 4.3\u00b10.2 ms, consistent with previous heavy-fluxonium devices, before subsequently decreasing.",
                                "To explain the measured relaxation times, we consider several avenues by which the qubit can decay, including Purcell loss, decay via charge and flux coupling to the control lines, 1/f flux noise, dielectric loss in the capacitor, and resistive loss in the superinductor. Conservative estimates of the flux noise induced loss are lower than the measured loss by nearly an order of magnitude. The loss near the flux-frustration point is believed to be largely due to dielectric loss in the capacitor. This can be thought of as Johnson-Nyquist current noise from the resistive part of the shunting capacitor, which couples to the phase matrix element g|{circumflex over (\u03c6)}|e, and grows rapidly as we approach the flux-frustration point. Assuming a fixed loss tangent for the capacitor, this loss rate is inversely proportional to the impedance of the capacitor, and is given by:",

Since \u03c9q is below the ambient temperature near the flux-frustration point, a combination of the temperature-dependent prefactor \u02dc2kBT/(\u210f\u03c9q), and the relation between charge and phase matrix elements in fluxonium, g|{circumflex over (n)}|e=\u03c9/(8Ec)g|{circumflex over (\u03d5)}|e, results in the dielectric-loss scaling as 1/\u03c9, which is consistent with the observed trend in the T1 near the flux-frustration point. The measured T1 at the flux-frustration point also sets an upper bound of 5\u00d710\u22129 for the loss tangent of the inductor. The decay from inductive loss, however, increases more rapidly with frequency than dielectric loss (\u221d1/\u03c93) and is inconsistent with measured data. Our qubit operations are performed between 0.4\u03a60-0.5\u03a60 where the T1 is mainly limited by dielectric loss. As we move further away from the flux-frustration point (\u02dc0.4\u03a60), T1 starts to decrease. This additional loss is believed to be due to a combination of radiative loss to the charge drive line, and Purcell loss from higher fluxonium levels excited by heating from the |g and |e states. The Purcell loss calculated based on the coupled fluxonium-resonator system using a bath temperature of 60 mK results in the dotted blue curve shown in FIG. 9A.

This value falls off rapidly as we move away from the flux-frustration point, consistent with the small tunnel coupling between levels.

We first rapidly move the flux-bias point away from the flux-frustration point in one direction and back, thus generating a rotation about the x axis through a large \u03c3x term in our computational basis. There is additionally a relatively small rotation about the z axis corresponding to the time \u0394tp of the triangular spike. We subsequently idle at the flux-frustration point for a duration \u0394tz, which results in a rotation by \u03c9q\u0394tz about the z axis. Finally, we rapidly move the flux-bias point in the other direction and back, resulting in a \u2212\u03c3x term and another small z rotation. We choose the two spikes to be exactly anti-symmetric, ensuring zero net flux, simultaneously minimizing the effect of microsecond and millisecond pulse distortions ubiquitous in flux-bias lines, and echoing out low-frequency noise. The pulse is also immune to shape distortions since the total \u03c3x and \u03c3z amplitudes depend only on the area of the spike and \u0394tz. By sweeping the amplitude A of the triangular spike and idling length \u0394tz of the pulse, and measuring the expectation value of the spin along each axis, we obtain the 2D Rabi patterns shown in FIG. 10C that provide a measure of our gate parameters. A vertical line cut of these graphs corresponds to Larmor precession in the lab frame, with an oscillation frequency of \u0394=14 MHz.

We have explored a new frequency regime in superconducting qubits and demonstrated the feasibility of a sub-thermal frequency qubit, providing a path for manipulating fluxonium qubits with computational frequencies in the range of several GHz at temperatures much higher than current dilution-refrigerator temperatures. Our new control scheme has dramatically improved the single-qubit gate speed of fluxonium qubits, making them a viable candidate for large-scale superconducting quantum computation. The gate pulses can be directly synthesized with inexpensive digital to analog converters, and are insensitive to shape distortions. Furthermore, the single-qubit gate scheme used in this work can be generalized to two inductively coupled fluxonium circuits, allowing for two-qubit gate operations without involving the participation of excited levels with more loss."
