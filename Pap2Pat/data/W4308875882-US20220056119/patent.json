                        "Activins belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily and exert a broad range of biological effects on cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activins are homo- or heterodimers of Inhibin\u03b2A, Inhibin\u03b2B, Inhibin\u03b2C and Inhibin\u03b2E, different combinations of which create the various members of the activin protein group. For example, Activin A is a homodimer of Inhibin\u03b2A and Activin B is a homodimer of Inhibin\u03b2B, whereas Activin AB is a heterodimer of Inhibin\u03b2A and Inhibin\u03b2B and Activin AC is a heterodimer of Inhibin\u03b2A and Inhibin\u03b2C (Tsuchida, K. et al., Cell Commun Signal 7:15 (2009)).",
                        "Activin A binds to and activates receptor complexes on the surface of cells known as Activin Type II receptors (Type IIA and Type IIB, also known as ActRIIA and ActRIIB, respectively). The activation of these receptors leads to the phosphorylation of an Activin Type I receptor (e.g., Alk4 or 7), which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of SMAD 2 and 3 proteins, the formation of SMAD complexes (with SMAD4), and the translocation of the SMAD complex to the cell nucleus, where SMAD2 and SMAD3 function to regulate transcription of various genes (Sozzani, S. and Musso, T., Blood 117(19):5013-5015 (2011)).",
                        "Activin A or other ligands (including GDF8 (myostatin), Activin B, Activin AB, Inhibin A, Inhibin B, GDF3, GDF11, Nodal, BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, BMP9, and BMP10) that bind to and activate ActRIIB have been associated with a variety of conditions, including muscle wasting in aging and disease, and pulmonary and cardiac conditions. For example, overexpression of Activin A in mouse airways has been implicated in pulmonary pathology reminiscent of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndome, which is attenuated via neutralization of Activin A with a fusion protein composed of the extracellular portion of the Activin type II receptor ActRIIB fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (Apostolou et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med., 185(4): 382-391). Similarly, Activin type II receptor (ActRII) ligands have been implicated in cardiac aging and heart failure. Inhibition of the ActRII pathway with an antibody (CDD866) that blocks ActRIIA and ActRIIB, or an ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein (RAP-031) that blocks pathway activation by binding circulating ActRII ligands, reduced cardiac ActRII signaling while restoring or preserving cardiac function (Roh et al., Sci. Transl. Med, 11, eaau8680, 2019).",
                        "Agents that bind to multiple ActRII ligands or generally inhibit ActRII signaling are known to cause various adverse effects when administered to human patients. The distinct roles of the many ActRII ligands have yet to be completely elucidated, and a need exists for specific inhibitors of ActRII ligands that can provide clinical benefits."

In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating, preventing and reducing the severity or progression of heart failure or one or more complications of heart failure. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for improving human cardiomyocyte function, including contractility and electrical properties.",
                                "As discussed herein, it has been discovered that an Activin A specific antagonist (e.g., an anti-Activin A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) provides a surprising effect on treating and preventing various compilations of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. For example, anti-Activin A antibodies can be used to prevent or reduce the severity of cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac fibrosis as well as improve cardiac function in a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) heart failure model. In addition, Activin A specific antagonist treatment can increase survival time of heart failure patients. Accordingly, the disclosure provides, in part, methods of using Activin A specific antagonists (e.g., an anti-Activin A antibodies or antigen-binding fragment thereof), alone or in combination with one or more additional supportive therapies and/or additional active agents, to treat, prevent, or reduce the severity of heart failure, particularly treating, preventing, or reducing the severity of one or more complications of a heart failure (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac fibrosis) as well as improving cardiac function and increasing survival time of heart failure patients.",
                                "As used herein, a therapeutic agent that \u201cprevents\u201d a disorder or condition refers to a compound that, in a statistical sample, reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in the treated sample relative to an untreated control sample or delays the onset of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated control sample. The term \u201ctreating\u201d as used herein includes amelioration or elimination of the condition once it has been established. In either case, prevention or treatment may be discerned in the diagnosis provided by a physician or other health care provider and the intended result of administration of the therapeutic agent.",
                                "In general, treatment or prevention of a disease or condition as described in the present disclosure is achieved by administering one or more Activin A specific antagonists (e.g., an anti-Activin A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) in an effective amount. An effective amount of an agent refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the present disclosure may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the agent to elicit a desired response in the individual. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result.",
                                "Heart failure is a clinical syndrome defined by typical symptoms and signs resulting from certain structural or functional abnormality of the heart (ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. McMurray J J et al. European Heart Journal 2012, 14(8):803-69; 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure, Yanzy C W et al. Circulation 2013, 128, e240-e327). For example, cardiac abnormalities may impair the ability to fill or eject blood, and/or lead to failure to deliver sufficient oxygen to meet the requirements of the metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures, or only at the expense of increased filling pressures. As used herein, the term heart failure encompasses a variety cardiovascular conditions which include, but are not limited to, heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure with normal ejection fraction, heart failure due to aortic stenosis, acute heart failure, chronic heart failure, congestive heart failure, congenital heart failure, compensated heart failure, decompensated heart failure, diastolic heart failure, systolic heart failure, right-side heart (ventricle) failure, left-side heart (ventricle) failure, biventricular heart failure, forward heart failure, backward heart failure, high output heart failure, low output heart failure. Also heart failure includes heart conditions relating to fluid build-up in the heart, such as myocardial edema.",
                                "In general, clinical manifestations of heart failure include, for example, dyspnea (shortness of breath), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and fatigue (which may limit exercise tolerance), fluid retention (which may lead to, for example, pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema), angina, hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac asthma, nocturia, ascities, congestive hepatopathy, coagulopathy, reduced renal blood flow, renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction, and stroke.",
                                "Although the phrase \u201ccongestive heart failure\u201d is often used to describe all types of heart failure, including the above listed types, congestive heart failure is more accurately descriptive of a symptom of heart failure relating to pulmonary congestion or fluid buildup in the lungs. This congestion is more commonly symptom of systolic and left-sided heart failure. As the efficiency of the pulmonary system declines, increased blood volume near the input side of the heart changes the pressure at the alveolar arterial interface, an interface between the lung capillaries and the alveolar space of the lungs. The change in pressure at the interface causes blood plasma to push out into the alveolar space in the lungs. Dyspnea and general fatigue are typical perceived manifestations of congestive heart failure.",
                                "There are many different ways to categorize heart failure. For example, heart failure may be characterized based on the side of the heart involved (left heart failure versus right heart failure). Right heart failure compromises pulmonary flow to the lungs. Left heart failure compromises aortic flow to the body and brain. Mixed presentations are common; left heart failure often leads to right heart failure in the longer term. Heart failure also may be classified on whether the abnormality is due to insufficient contraction (systolic dysfunction; systolic heart failure), or due to insufficient relaxation of the heart (diastolic dysfunction; diastolic heart failure), or to both. In addition, heart failure may be classified on whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure (preload), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion (afterload). Heart failure may be classified on whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high systemic vascular resistance or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low-output heart failure vs. high-output heart failure). Also, heart failure may be classified based on the degree of coexisting illness, for example, heart failure/systemic hypertension, heart failure/pulmonary hypertension, heart failure/diabetes, and heart failure/kidney failure.",
                                "Furthermore, heart failure may be classified based on the degree of functional impairment conferred by the cardiac abnormality. Functional classification generally relies on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification. The classes (I-IV) are: class I: no limitation is experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities; class II: slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion; class III: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at rest; and class IV: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest. This score documents the severity of symptoms and can be used to assess response to treatment.",
                                "In its 2001 guidelines the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC) working group introduced four stages of heart failure [see, e.g., Hunt, S., \u201cACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Update the 2001 Guidelines for the Evaluation and Management of Heart Failure),\u201d J. Am, Coll. Cardiol, 46:e1-e82 (2005]. The first stage, Stage A, is a subject at high risk for heart failure but without structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure (for example, these are patients with hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome or patients using cardiotoxins). The second stage, Stage B, is a subject having structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of heart failure (for example, these are patients who have previously had a myocardial infarction, exhibit cardiac remodeling including hypertrophy and low ejection fraction, and patients with asymptomatic valvular disease). The third stage, Stage C, is a subject having structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of heart failure (for example, these are patients who have known structural heart disease and exhibit shortness of breath and fatigue and have reduced exercise tolerance). The fourth and final stage, Stage D, is refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions (for example, patients who have marked symptoms at rest despite maximal medical therapy (namely, those who are recurrently hospitalized or cannot be safely discharged from the hospital without specialized interventions). The ACC staging system is useful in that Stage A encompasses \u201cpre-heart failure\u201d\u2014a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms. ACC Stage A does not have a corresponding NYHA class. ACC Stage B would correspond to NYHA Class I. ACC Stage C corresponds to NYHA Class II and III, while ACC Stage D overlaps with NYHA Class IV.",
                                "Cardiac remodeling, which usually precedes clinical signs of heart failure, refers to the molecular, cellular and/or interstitial changes manifested clinically as changes in size, shape and function of the heart generally resulting from cardiac load or injury (Cohn J N et al. JACC 2000. 35(3):569-82). Triggers for cardiac remodeling include, for example, myocardial infarction, hypertension, wall stress, inflammation, pressure overload, and volume overload. Alterations in myocardial structure can occur as quickly as within a few hours of injury and may progress over months and years. While initially beneficial, these changes can impair myocardial function to the point of chronic intractable heart failure over time (months to years). Hallmarks of cardiac remodeling include, for example, chamber dilation, increase in ventricular sphericity, and development of interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. Increased sphericity is positively associated with mitral regurgitation. Ventricular dilation mainly results from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and lengthening and to a lesser extent from increases in the ventricular mass.",
                                "In some embodiments, Activin A specific antagonists of the disclosure (e.g., an anti-Activin A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof) may be used to treat, prevent, or reduce the progression of cardiac remodeling. For example, Activin A specific antagonists may be used to maintain myocardial structure or decrease alterations in myocardial structure of the heart in a subject. Progression of cardiac remodeling can be assessed by comparing the alterations in myocardial structure of the heart over a period of time between two groups of subjects, in which a first group (the treatment group) is treated by the methods of the present invention, and a second group (the placebo group) is treated by using a placebo in replacement or in lieu of the treatment by the methods of the present invention. If the alterations in myocardial structure of the heart in the subjects of the treatment group are less than the alterations in myocardial structure of the heart in the subjects of the placebo group, then a determination is made that there has been a reduction in the progression of cardiac remodeling. Methods for determining disease progression or development, such as cardiac remodeling, can be assessed using well known methods including, for example, physical examination, 2-dimensional echocardiogram coupled with Doppler flow studies, ultrasound, MRI, computerized tomography, cardiac catheterization, radionuclide imaging (such as radionuclide ventriculography) as well as any combinations thereof.",
                                "In general, cardiac remodeling and heart failure result from disorders and conditions that cause persistent increase in cardiac workload or injury. Disorders and conditions leading to heart failure include, for example, loss of viable myocardium after myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy from infections or alcohol/drug abuse, etc.), heart valve disease and dysfunction including, for example, aortic valve diseases (e.g., aortic valve insufficiency, aortic valve regurgitation, and aortic stenosis (aortic valve stenosis)), pulmonary disorders (e.g., pulmonary hypertension), congenital heart defects, acute ischemic injury, reperfusion injury, pericardium disorders and abnormalities, myocardium disorders, great vessels disorders, endocardium disorders, atrial fibrillation, impairment of left ventricular myocardial function, impairment of right ventricular myocardial function, cardiac arrhythmias, thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes, weakening of the heart muscle which leave it unable to pump enough blood, thyroid disease, neurohormonal imbalances, viral infections, and anemia. As such disorders and conditions may lead to cardiac remodeling and/or heart failure, subjects having, or suspected of having, one or more of these conditions are preferred subjects for treatment with one or more Activin A specific antagonists (e.g., an anti-Activin A antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof), optionally in combination with one or more additional active agents or supportive therapies for treating cardiac remodeling and/or heart failure, in accordance with the present invention. In some embodiments, subjects with signs of cardiac remodeling (e.g., myocardial hypertrophy and ventricular dilation) or with overt heart failure, even when the underlying etiology cannot be detected, are also suitable for treatment in accordance with the present disclosure as preventing further cardiac remodeling or treating existing cardiac remodeling or reducing cardiac remodeling would be beneficial in these subjects. In some embodiments, subjects with risk factors for cardiac remodeling and/or heart failure development (e.g., subjects with those conditions that may lead to cardiac remodeling and/or chronic heart failure described herein) are also suitable for treatment in accordance with the present disclosure.",
                                "In general, hypertension or high blood pressure refers to a resting blood pressure, as measured with, for example, a sphygmomanometer, of greater than 120 mmHg (systolic)/80 mmHg (diastolic). Blood pressure between 121-139/81-89 is considered prehypertension and above this level (140/90 mm Hg or higher) is considered high (hypertension). Unless otherwise indicated, both prehypertension and hypertension blood pressure are included in the meaning of \u201chypertension\u201d as used herein. For example, resting blood pressures of 135 mmHg/87 or of 140 mmHg/90 mmHg are intended to be within the scope of the term \u201chypertension\u201d even though the 135/87 is generally considered within a prehypertensive category. Blood pressures of 145 mm Hg/90 mmHg, 140 mmHg/95 mmHg, and 142 mmHg/93 mmHg are further examples of high blood pressures. It will be appreciated that blood pressure normally varies throughout the day. It can even vary slightly with each heartbeat. Normally, it increases during activity and decreases at rest. It's often higher in cold weather and can rise when under stress. More accurate blood pressure readings can be obtained by daily monitoring blood pressure, where the blood pressure reading is taken at the same time each day to minimize the effect that external factors. Several readings over time may be needed to determine whether blood pressure is high. In general chronic hypertension refers to a subject which exhibits hypertension either continuously or intermittently for an extended period of time, such as, but not limited to at least one week, at least two weeks, at least three weeks, at least four weeks, at least two months, at least six months, at least one year, at least two years, at least three years, at least four years, at least five years, at least 10 years, etc.",
                                "In general, cardiac arrhythmia refers to a condition where the muscle contraction of the heart becomes irregular. An unusually fast rhythm (e.g., more than 100 beats per minute) is called tachycardia. An unusually slow rhythm (e.g., fewer than 60 beats per minute) is called bradycardia.",
                                "In general, cardiac hypertrophy refers to cardiac enlargement, a condition characterized by an increase in the size of heart and the individual cardiac muscle cells, particularly ventricular muscle cells, and an increase in the size of the inside cavity of a chamber of the heart.",
                                "Ejection fraction is the percentage of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. Ejection fraction may be measured, for example, during an echocardiogram. Ejection fraction is an important measurement of how well a heart is pumping and can be used to classify heart failure and to guide treatment. Heart failure can be classified as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (also referred to as diastolic heart failure) or as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (also referred to as systolic heart failure). A recent study demonstrated that the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction increased over a 15-year period, with no marked improvement in the mortality rates. If these trends continue, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may become the most common form of heart failure, demonstrating a growing public health problem (Owan et al., 2006, N Engl J Med; 355(3):251-9).",

As used herein, reducing the incidences of cardiovascular events refers to maintaining or reducing the number of cardiovascular events experienced by a subject during or over the course of a period of time. A reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events can be assessed or determined by comparing the incidences of cardiovascular events over or during the course of a period of time between two groups of subjects, in which a first group (the treatment group) is treated by the methods of the present invention, and a second group (the placebo group) is treated by using a placebo (namely, dummy pills) in replacement or in lieu of the treatment by the methods of the present invention.

Patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing cardiovascular disease have been reported to have an increased risk of severe disease and death. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism (Driggin et al., J Am Coll Cardiol., 75(18):2352-2371, May 2020). Hyperinflammatory responses associated with production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have also been reported in COVID-19 patients (Soy et al., Clinical Rheumatology, doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05190-5, May 2020). Without intending to be bound by theory, increases in cytokine production may activate increased Activin A expression, which in turn reduces cardiomyocyte contractile amplitude, slows contractile kinetics, and impairs cardiomyocyte calcium handling, resulting in cardiac dysfunction and, in some cases, heart failure.",

Exemplary categories of antigen-specific binding proteins include antibodies, antigen-binding portions of antibodies, peptides that specifically interact with a particular antigen (e.g., peptibodies), receptor molecules that specifically interact with a particular antigen (but not other antigens), and proteins comprising a ligand-binding portion of a receptor that specifically binds a particular antigen (but not other antigens).",

Activins are homo- and hetero-dimeric molecules comprising beta subunits, i.e., Inhibin \u03b2A, inhibin \u03b2B, inhibin \u03b2C, and/or inhibin \u03b2E. The \u03b2A subunit has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:226 and the \u03b2B subunit has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:228. Activin A is a homodimer of two \u03b2A subunits; Activin B is a homodimer of two \u03b2B subunits; Activin AB is a heterodimer of one \u03b2A subunit and one \u03b2B subunit; and Activin AC is a heterodimer of one \u03b2A subunit and one \u03b2C subunit. An Activin A-specific binding protein may be an antigen-specific binding protein that specifically binds the \u03b2A subunit. Since the \u03b2A subunit is found in Activin A, Activin AB, and Activin AC molecules, an \u201cActivin A-specific binding protein\u201d can be an antigen-specific binding protein that specifically binds Activin A as well as Activin AB and Activin AC (by virtue of its interaction with the \u03b2A subunit). Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, an Activin A-specific binding protein specifically binds Activin A; or Activin A and Activin AB; or Activin A and Activin AC; or Activin A, Activin AB and Activin AC, but does not bind other ActRIIB ligands such as Activin B, GDF3, GDF8, BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, BMP9, BMP10, GDF11, Nodal, etc. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, an Activin A-specific binding protein specifically binds to Activin A but does not bind significantly to Activin B or Activin C. In another embodiment, an Activin A-specific binding protein may also bind to Activin B (by virtue of cross-reaction with the \u03b2B subunit, i.e., Inhibin\u03b2B). In another embodiment, an Activin A-specific binding protein is a binding protein that binds specifically to Activin A but does not bind to any other ligand of ActRIIB. In another embodiment, an Activin A-specific binding protein is a binding protein and binds specifically to Activin A and does not bind to any Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) (e.g., BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, BMP9, BMP10).

Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.",

In one form, an immunoglobulin molecule comprises a stable four chain construct of approximately 150-160 kDa in which the dimers are held together by an interchain heavy chain disulfide bond. In a second form, the dimers are not linked via inter-chain disulfide bonds and a molecule of about 75-80 kDa is formed composed of a covalently coupled light and heavy chain (half-antibody). These forms have been extremely difficult to separate, even after affinity purification.",
                                "The frequency of appearance of the second form in various intact IgG isotypes is due to, but not limited to, structural differences associated with the hinge region isotype of the antibody. A single amino acid substitution in the hinge region of the human IgG4 hinge can significantly reduce the appearance of the second form (Angal et al. Molecular Immunology 30:105 1993)) to levels typically observed using a human IgG1 hinge.

The inhibition caused by an Activin A neutralizing or blocking antibody need not be complete so long as it is detectable using an appropriate assay. Exemplary assays for detecting Activin A inhibition are described in the working examples herein.",
                                "The anti-Activin A antibodies disclosed herein may comprise one or more amino acid substitutions, insertions and/or deletions in the framework and/or CDR regions of the heavy and light chain variable domains as compared to the corresponding germline sequences from which the antibodies were derived. Such mutations can be readily ascertained by comparing the amino acid sequences disclosed herein to germline sequences available from, for example, public antibody sequence databases. The present invention includes antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which are derived from any of the amino acid sequences disclosed herein, wherein one or more amino acids within one or more framework and/or CDR regions are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of the germline sequence from which the antibody was derived, or to the corresponding residue(s) of another human germline sequence, or to a conservative amino acid substitution of the corresponding germline residue(s) (such sequence changes are referred to herein collectively as \u201cgermline mutations\u201d). A person of ordinary skill in the art, starting with the heavy and light chain variable region sequences disclosed herein, can easily produce numerous antibodies and antigen-binding fragments which comprise one or more individual germline mutations or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, all of the framework and/or CDR residues within the VH and/or VL domains are mutated back to the residues found in the original germline sequence from which the antibody was derived. In other embodiments, only certain residues are mutated back to the original germline sequence, e.g., only the mutated residues found within the first 8 amino acids of FR1 or within the last 8 amino acids of FR4, or only the mutated residues found within CDR1, CDR2 or CDR3. In other embodiments, one or more of the framework and/or CDR residue(s) are mutated to the corresponding residue(s) of a different germline sequence (i.e., a germline sequence that is different from the germline sequence from which the antibody was originally derived). Furthermore, the antibodies of the present invention may contain any combination of two or more germline mutations within the framework and/or CDR regions, e.g., wherein certain individual residues are mutated to the corresponding residue of a particular germline sequence while certain other residues that differ from the original germline sequence are maintained or are mutated to the corresponding residue of a different germline sequence. Once obtained, antibodies and antigen-binding fragments that contain one or more germline mutations can be easily tested for one or more desired property such as, improved binding specificity, increased binding affinity, improved or enhanced antagonistic or agonistic biological properties (as the case may be), reduced immunogenicity, etc. Antibodies and antigen-binding fragments obtained in this general manner are encompassed within the present invention.",

                                "The term \u201cepitope\u201d refers to an antigenic determinant that interacts with a specific antigen binding site in the variable region of an antibody molecule known as a paratope. A single antigen may have more than one epitope. Thus, different antibodies may bind to different areas on an antigen and may have different biological effects. Epitopes may be either conformational or linear. A conformational epitope is produced by spatially juxtaposed amino acids from different segments of the linear polypeptide chain. A linear epitope is one produced by adjacent amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. In certain circumstance, an epitope may include moieties of saccharides, phosphoryl groups, or sulfonyl groups on the antigen.",

A nucleic acid molecule having substantial identity to a reference nucleic acid molecule may, in certain instances, encode a polypeptide having the same or substantially similar amino acid sequence as the polypeptide encoded by the reference nucleic acid molecule.",

Preferably, residue positions which are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. A \u201cconservative amino acid substitution\u201d is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of similarity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson, W. R., Methods Mol Biol 24: 307-331 (1994), herein incorporated by reference. Examples of groups of amino acids that have side chains with similar chemical properties include (1) aliphatic side chains: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine; (2) aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains: serine and threonine; (3) amide-containing side chains: asparagine and glutamine; (4) aromatic side chains: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; (5) basic side chains: lysine, arginine, and histidine; (6) acidic side chains: aspartate and glutamate, and (7) sulfur-containing side chains are cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamate-aspartate, and asparagine-glutamine. Alternatively, a conservative replacement is any change having a positive value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix disclosed in Gonnet et al., Science 256: 1443-1445 (1992), herein incorporated by reference. A \u201cmoderately conservative\u201d replacement is any change having a nonnegative value in the PAM250 log-likelihood matrix.",
                                "Sequence similarity for polypeptides, which is also referred to as sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG software contains programs such as Gap and Bestfit which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. Polypeptide sequences also can be compared using FASTA using default or recommended parameters, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (see, e.g., Pearson, W. R., Methods Mol Biol 132: 185-219 (2000), herein incorporated by reference). Another preferred algorithm when comparing a sequence of the invention to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST, especially BLASTP or TBLASTN, using default parameters.

Such mutations may result in an increase in serum half-life of the antibody when administered to an animal. Non-limiting examples of such Fc modifications include, e.g., a modification at position 250 (e.g., E or Q); 250 and 428 (e.g., L or F); 252 (e.g., L/Y/F/W or T), 254 (e.g., S or T), and 256 (e.g., S/R/Q/E/D or T); or a modification at position 428 and/or 433 (e.g., H/L/R/S/P/Q or K) and/or 434 (e.g., A, W, H, F or Y [N434A, N434W, N434H, N434F or N434Y]); or a modification at position 250 and/or 428; or a modification at position 307 or 308 (e.g., 308F, V308F), and 434.

Exemplary techniques include, e.g., routine cross-blocking assay such as that described Antibodies, Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harb., N.Y.), alanine scanning mutational analysis, peptide blots analysis (Reineke, Methods Mol Biol 248:443-463 (2004)), and peptide cleavage analysis. In addition, methods such as epitope excision, epitope extraction and chemical modification of antigens can be employed (Tomer, Protein Science 9:487-496 (2000)). Another method that can be used to identify the amino acids within a polypeptide with which an antibody interacts is hydrogen/deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry. In general terms, the hydrogen/deuterium exchange method involves deuterium-labeling the protein of interest, followed by binding the antibody to the deuterium-labeled protein. Next, the protein/antibody complex is transferred to water to allow hydrogen-deuterium exchange to occur at all residues except for the residues protected by the antibody (which remain deuterium-labeled). After dissociation of the antibody, the target protein is subjected to protease cleavage and mass spectrometry analysis, thereby revealing the deuterium-labeled residues which correspond to the specific amino acids with which the antibody interacts. See, e.g., Ehring, Analytical Biochemistry 267(2):252-259 (1999); Engen and Smith, Anal. Chem. 73:256A-265A (2001).",

For example, to determine if a test antibody binds to the same epitope as a reference anti-Activin A antibody of the invention, the reference antibody is allowed to bind to Activin A (or a \u03b2A subunit-containing heterodimer). Next, the ability of a test antibody to bind to Activin A is assessed. If the test antibody is able to bind to Activin A following saturation binding with the reference anti-Activin A antibody, it can be concluded that the test antibody binds to a different epitope than the reference anti-Activin A antibody. On the other hand, if the test antibody is not able to bind to Activin A following saturation binding with the reference anti-Activin A antibody, then the test antibody may bind to the same epitope as the epitope bound by the reference anti-Activin A antibody of the invention. Additional routine experimentation (e.g., peptide mutation and binding analyses) can then be carried out to confirm whether the observed lack of binding of the test antibody is in fact due to binding to the same epitope as the reference antibody or if steric blocking (or another phenomenon) is responsible for the lack of observed binding. Experiments of this sort can be performed using ELISA, RIA, Biacore, flow cytometry or any other quantitative or qualitative antibody-binding assay available in the art. In accordance with certain embodiments of the present invention, two antibodies bind to the same (or overlapping) epitope if, e.g., a 1-, 5-, 10-, 20- or 100-fold excess of one antibody inhibits binding of the other by at least 50% but preferably 75%, 90% or even 99% as measured in a competitive binding assay (see, e.g., Junghans et al., Cancer Res. 50:1495-1502 (1990)). Alternatively, two antibodies are deemed to bind to the same epitope if essentially all amino acid mutations in the antigen that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other. Two antibodies are deemed to have \u201coverlapping epitopes\u201d if only a subset of the amino acid mutations that reduce or eliminate binding of one antibody reduce or eliminate binding of the other.",

In a second orientation, the test antibody is allowed to bind to Activin A under saturating conditions followed by assessment of binding of the reference antibody to Activin A. If, in both orientations, only the first (saturating) antibody is capable of binding to Activin A, then it is concluded that the test antibody and the reference antibody compete for binding to Activin A. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an antibody that competes for binding with a reference antibody may not necessarily bind to the same epitope as the reference antibody, but may sterically block binding of the reference antibody by binding an overlapping or adjacent epitope.",

In one embodiment, the first Ig CH3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig CH3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification (by IMGT exon numbering; H435R by EU numbering). The second CH3 may further comprise a Y96F modification (by IMGT; Y436F by EU). Further modifications that may be found within the second CH3 include: D16E, L18M, N44S, K52N, V57M, and V82I (by IMGT; D356E, L358M, N384S, K392N, V397M, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG1 antibodies; N44S, K52N, and V82I (IMGT; N384S, K392N, and V422I by EU) in the case of IgG2 antibodies; and Q15R, N44S, K52N, V57M, R69K, E79Q, V82I, and L105P (by IMGT; Q355R, N384S, K392N, V397M, R409K, E419Q, V422I, and L445P by EU) in the case of IgG4 antibodies. Variations on the bi-specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.",
                                "Other exemplary bispecific formats that can be used in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, e.g., scFv-based or diabody bispecific formats, IgG-scFv fusions, dual variable domain (DVD)-Ig, Quadroma, knobs-into-holes, common light chain (e.g., common light chain with knobs-into-holes, etc.), CrossMab, CrossFab, (SEED)body, leucine zipper, Duobody, IgG1/IgG2, dual acting Fab (DAF)-IgG, and Mab2 bispecific formats (see, e.g., Klein et al., mAbs 4:6, 1-11 (2012), and references cited therein, for a review of the foregoing formats). Bispecific antibodies can also be constructed using peptide/nucleic acid conjugation, e.g., wherein unnatural amino acids with orthogonal chemical reactivity are used to generate site-specific antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates which then self-assemble into multimeric complexes with defined composition, valency and geometry. (See, e.g., Kazane et al., J Am Chem Soc. 135(1):340-346 (2013)).",

The preferred dose is typically calculated according to body weight or body surface area. When an antibody of the present invention is used for treating a condition or disease associated with Activin A activity in an adult patient, it may be advantageous to intravenously administer the antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.02 to about 7, about 0.03 to about 5, or about 0.05 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. In some cases, the dose is 3 mg/kg. In some cases, the does is 10 mg/kg. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. A patient with \u201csevere\u201d disease (e.g., COVID-19) requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal canula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device. A patient with \u201ccritical\u201d disease (e.g., COVID-19) requires supplemental oxygen delivered by non-rebreather mask of high-flow nasal canula or the use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation or requires treatment in an intensive care unit. Effective dosages and schedules for administering anti-Activin A antibodies may be determined empirically; for example, patient progress can be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Moreover, interspecies scaling of dosages can be performed using well-known methods in the art (e.g., Mordenti et al., Pharmaceut Res 8:1351 (1991)).",

The antibody immune response was monitored by a Activin A-specific immunoassay. When a desired immune response was achieved splenocytes were harvested and fused with mouse myeloma cells to preserve their viability and form hybridoma cell lines. The hybridoma cell lines were screened and selected to identify cell lines that produce Activin A-specific antibodies. Using this technique several anti-Activin A chimeric antibodies (i.e., antibodies possessing human variable domains and mouse constant domains) were obtained. An exemplary antibody obtained in this manner is H2aM10965N. The human variable domains from the chimeric antibodies were subsequently cloned onto human constant domains to make fully human anti-Activin A antibodies as described herein.",

Antibodies, expressed as either mouse Fc (prefix H2aM) or human Fc (prefix H4H), were captured on their respective anti-Fc sensor surfaces (mAb capture format). Anti-Activin A antibodies were captured on either a goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (GE Healthcare, #BR-1008-38) or a mouse anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody (GE Healthcare, #BR-1008-39) surface created through direct amine coupling to a Biacore CM5 sensor chip. Kinetic experiments were carried out using either HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% Surfactant P20, at pH 7.4) or PBS-P (10 mM Sodium Phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 7.4), as both the running buffer and the sample buffer. Antigen-antibody association rates were measured by injecting various concentrations (4-fold dilutions ranging from 50 to 0.2 nM) of either Activin A (R&D Systems, #338-AC-050/CF), Activin B (R&D Systems, #659-AB-025/CF), Activin AB (R&D Systems, #1006-AB-005), Activin AC (R&D Systems, #4879-AC/CF), or Inhibin E (Novus Biologicals, #H00083729-P01) over the captured antibody surface. Antibody-antigen association was monitored for 240 seconds while dissociation in buffer was monitored for 600 seconds. Kinetic association and dissociation rate constants were determined by processing and fitting the data using Scrubber software version 2.0c. Binding equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) and dissociative half-lives (t1/2) were then calculated from the kinetic rate constants as: KD (M)=kd/ka and t1/2 (min)=[ln 2/(60*kd)].

The interaction between ActRIIA and ActRIIB and activin leads to the induction of diverse cellular processes including growth regulation, metastatis of cancer cells and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (Tsuchida, K. et al., Cell Commun Signal 7:15 (2009)). Phosphorylation and activation of the Type I receptor leads to phosphorylation of SMAD 2 and 3 proteins which form activated SMAD complexes leading to transcriptional regulation of genes.",
                                "To detect the activation of the SMAD complex signal transduction pathway via activin binding to activin Type II receptors, a human A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (ATCC, #HTB-82) was transfected with a Smad 2/3-luciferase reporter plasmid (CAGAx12-Luc; Dennler, 1998) to create the A204/CAGAx12-Luc cell line. A204/CAGAx12-Luc cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A (Irvine Scientific, #9090) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine and 250 pg/mL of G418. For the bioassay, A204/CAGAx12-Luc cells were seeded onto 96-well assay plates at 10,000 cells/well in low serum media, 0.5% FBS and OPTIMEM (Invitrogen, #31985-070), and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2 overnight. To determine the ligand dose response, Activin A (R&D Systems, #338-AC), Activin B (R&D Systems, #659-AB), Activin AB (R&D Systems, #1066-AB) and Activin AC (R&D Systems, #4879-AC/CF) were serially diluted at 1:3 from 100 to 0.002 nM and added to cells starting along with a control containing no Activin. Activin A, Activin B, Activin AB, and Activin AC were observed to activate the A204/CAGAx12-Luc cell line with EC50 values of 99 pM, 47 pM, 19 pM, and 4.4 nM, respectively. To measure inhibition, antibodies were serially diluted at 1:3 starting from 100 to 0.002 nM, 1000 to 0.02 nM, or 300 to 0.005 nM including control samples containing either an appropriate isotype control antibody or no antibody and added to cells with a constant concentration of 100 pM Activin A, 50 pM Activin B, 30 pM Activin AB or 4 nM Activin AC. Also used as a positive blocking control in this assay was Control 4 (ActRIIB-hFc; SEQ ID No:227). After 5.5 hours of incubation in 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO2, OneGlo substrate (Promega, #E6051) was added and then luciferase activity was detected using a Victor X (Perkin Elmer) instrument. The results were analyzed using nonlinear regression (4-parameter logistics) with Prism 5 software (GraphPad).",

A subset of the anti-Activin A antibodies of the invention were tested for blocking Activin B, AB, and AC. Four of the 9 antibodies tested blocked 50 pM of Activin B with IC50 values ranging from 130 pM to 100 nM. Five antibodies of the invention that were tested for Activin B blockade only blocked at high antibody concentrations, while Control 1 did not show any measurable Activin B blockade. Eight antibodies of the invention tested blocked 30 pM of Activin AB with IC50 values ranging from 100 pM to 8.2 nM, while Control 4 blocked with an IC50 value of 540 pM. One antibody, H4H10423P, only demonstrated weak blockade of Activin AB. Seven of the 8 antibodies tested blocked 4 nM of Activin AC with IC50 values ranging from 580 pM to 6.5 nM, while Control 4 blocked with an IC50 value of 1.1 nM. One antibody, H4H10423P, did not demonstrate any blockade of Activin AC. Both mouse IgG (mIgG isotype control) and human IgG (hIgG isotype control) negative controls did not block ligand activation of the receptors.",

To test for functional inhibition of these ligands with activin A antibodies, the assay was performed using conditions described above but substituting GDF8 or GDF11 for the activating ligand, which resulted in EC50 values of 188 pM and 84 pM, respectively. In this assay, activation by a constant concentration of 0.50 nM GDF8 or 0.40 nM GDF11 was completely blocked by Control 4 with IC50 values of 298 pM and 214 pM, respectively. Using these same constant concentrations of ligands, no inhibition of either GDF8 or GDF11 was observed by the activin A antibodies, H4H10446P2 and H4H10430P, when tested at up to 100 nM of the antibodies. On a separate day, the activin A antibodies H4H10429P and H4H10436P2 were tested for inhibition in this assay in the presence of constant concentrations of 250 pM GDF8 or 250 pM GDF11, and no inhibition was observed after incubation of the cells with up to 150 nM of the tested activin A antibodies; GDF8 and GDF11 alone in this assay exhibited EC50 values of 124 pM and 166 pM, respectively. These data demonstrate that the Activin A antibodies H4H10446P2, H4H10430P, H4H10429P and H4H10436P2 do not functionally inhibit GDF8 or GDF11."

An inhibitory activin A antibody (mAb2; H$H10446P2) blocked this increase in SMAD phosphorylation (see FIG. 12). These data demonstrate that activin A induces signaling in iPSC-CMs.",

In this study, iPSC-CMs were plated on electrode-containing, 96-well plates (NSP-96; Nanion Technologies) and recorded for 30 seconds every 4 hours.

Amplitude, downstroke velocity (maximal slope during depolarization), and field potential duration (FPDMax: the time between the first deflection for depolarization and the maximum of the repolarization curve) were characterized for each mean beat. An elongated action potential was observed in cardiomyocytes chronically treated with activin A (1 nM) compared to control (0.56\u00b10.01 vs 0.49\u00b10.02 sec, P<0.01). 25 nM of an inhibitory antibody (mAb1) prevented this increase in action potential duration whereas the isotype control antibody did not (0.51\u00b10.05 vs 0.56\u00b10.02 sec).

Calcium flux traces were produced and analyzed using SoftMax Pro Software (Molecular Devices). Chronic treatment of Activin A (1 nM) compared to the media control reduced peak calcium flux amplitude (447\u00b133 vs 609\u00b199 RFU, p<0.05), increased calcium flux falling time (0.70\u00b10.04 sec vs 0.52\u00b10.05 sec, p<0.0001) and increased the calcium flux rising time (0.40\u00b10.06 vs 0.24\u00b10.03 sec, p<0.01).

Activin A concentration in conditioned media were quantified by ELISA. Within each main treatment condition (IL1b, TNF\u03b1), Activin A induction for each cotreatment was compared to DMSO cotreatment using pairwise t-tests. Results are shown in FIG. 11. Only significant (p<0.05) Bonferroni corrected comparisons are shown. Within a group, each point is a technical replicate. Relative to DMSO treatment, Activin A induction after either IL-1 or TNFalpha treatment was significantly lower in IKKi treated cells (t(2)=41.4, p=0.0006). In contrast, cells treated with either the JNKi. and p38i+JNKi conditions exhibited much less inhibition of Activin A induction, relative to DMSO treatment. Combination treatment using IKKi resulted in a similar inhibition as treatment with IKKi alone. Thus, IL1 and TNF induced Activin A via the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway, independent of p38 or Jnk, and increased cytokine levels (e.g., IL-1 and TNF\u03b1) are associated with an increased need for supplemental oxygen and risk of death in COVID-19 patients.",
