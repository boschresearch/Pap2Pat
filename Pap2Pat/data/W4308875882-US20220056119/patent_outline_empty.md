# DESCRIPTION

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

## BACKGROUND

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### Methods of Preventing and Treating Cardiac Dysfunction and Heart Failure

### Activin A-Specific Antagonists

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1. Generation of Human Antibodies to Activin A

### Example 2. Heavy and Light Chain Variable Region Amino Acid Sequences

### Control Constructs Used in the Following Examples

### Example 3. Antibody Binding to Human Activin A as Determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance

### Example 4. Inhibition of Activin A-Mediated Receptor Activation and SMAD Complex Signaling with Anti-Activin A Antibodies

### Example 5. Blocking of Activin A Binding Using Activin A Antibodies

### Example 6. Activin A Induces Upstream Signaling and Activates Cardiac Stress Genes in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Cardiomyocytes

### Example 7. Anti-Activin A Induces Contractile and Electrophysiologic Dysfunction of IPSC-Cardiomyocytes that is Blocked by Anti-Activin A Antibodies

### Example 8. Serum Levels of Activin A, Follistatin-Related Gene (FLRG) and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are Increased in COVID-19 Patients, and Correlate with Disease Severity
