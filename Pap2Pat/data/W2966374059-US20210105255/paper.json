    "title": "New Authentication Algorithm Based on Verifiable Encryption with Digital Identity",
    "date": "2019-07-29",
    "abstract": "We propose a new authentication algorithm for small internet of things (IoT) devices without key distribution and secure servers. Encrypted private data are stored on the cloud server in the registration step and compared with incoming encrypted data without decryption in the verification step. We call a set of encryptions that can verify two encrypted data items without decryption a verifiable encryption (VE). In this paper, we define VE, and claim that several cryptosystems belong to the VE class. Moreover, we introduce an authentication algorithm based on VE, and show an example of the algorithm and discuss its performance and security. As the algorithm neither shares any secret keys nor decrypts, its computation time becomes very small.",

                "Besides the recent development of network services and internet of things (IoT) devices, an efficient processing technology for encrypted big data is required. For this purpose, speed and security should be balanced reasonably. One of the well-known methods to achieve this is searchable encryption (SE) where one can search keywords on encrypted messages without obtaining more information than search results. SE has been studied for about 20 years, and it is expected as a possible solution applicable to cloud services [1,2]. In recent years, SE focused on IoT and big data has also been actively studied [3][4][5][6]. SE is provided between users and servers with the special function for encryption. There are several algorithms of SE [7][8][9][10][11], and one can calculate the distance between two ciphered texts without decryption, where the distance is equivalent to that between the original plain texts. However, in each case, the requirement of resource costs, for example, computational power, time, and memory size, is expensive.",
                "In this paper, we propose a class of cryptosystems where the distance is calculated on the space of ciphered texts, the so-called verifiable encryption (VE). We also construct a fast and secure authentication algorithm based on the VE. The known authentication algorithms, viz., Fiat-Shamir [12] and Schnorr [13], are shown to be included in the class of VE. Moreover, we provide the implementation of one of the new authentication algorithms and demonstrate its performance."

                "Security problems are based on two different factors. One is the identification method and the other is the cryptosystem. The identification problem arises from the registration step in authentication. For instance, the service provider queries the issuer as to whether the customer's information is authentic the first time. Queries are sent via an insecure network; then the authentication requires a cryptographic system, which is a public key agreement (PKA), and the trusted third party for the preparation of parameters such as a certificate authority (CA). The digital identity must be encrypted before sending, and the secret keys must also be distributed. Therefore, the process generates some time cost and consumes computational resources. In many cases, identification algorithms based on interactive proof are applied to authentication. One of the well-known authentication algorithms is based on zero-knowledge proof [12,13]. Because digital identity is static material for each service, it is not necessary to be queried every time. To unlock our smartphones, we just put our finger or look at the display for face recognition. Digital identity is stored in the local storage, and never sent via the network. There are two usages of digital identity:",

Implicitly, the connection between the user and device is supposed to be safe. We usually post our passphrases, pin codes, fingerprints, or biometrics to the device as it is.

Authentication via the network pays a significant cost to protect itself, and unlocking the device does not take account of protection.

It was shown that the special cases of Fiat-Shamir and Schnorr, and one-time pad (also any stream ciphers) are included in the class of VE. We also constructed an authentication algorithm, which incorporates speed and security without PKA and SSL/TLS, with the one-time pad. The velocity of the protocol is less than 0.003 ms with 8192 bits of key length. If digital identity, such as biometric information, is employed, it is necessary to set a threshold value and calculate the Hamming distance. Moreover, we discussed on the possible attack such as impersonation and plain text attack. The authentication is essentially weak against the impersonation as well as unlocking smartphone, however, strong against plain text attack."
