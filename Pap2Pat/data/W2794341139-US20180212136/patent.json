                        "Nb3Sn superconducting strands can be manufactured by several different processes, including the Bronze Process [1], Powder in Tube [2], and Internal Tin [3]. For the Internal Tin process the diffusion barrier can be a single non-reacting barrier [4] as was used for the ITER fusion project, or have multiple distributed reactable diffusion barriers as in the Rod Restack Process [5]. Internal Tin Nb3Sn superconducting strands are fabricated by co-drawing ductile metallic alloys of Nb, Cu, and Sn (usually with alloying of Ti and/or Ta for doping purposes) in an array of features called \u2018sub-elements\u2019 12, as seen in FIG. 1, which are re-stacked in a Cu jacket 11 to form the full superconductor wire precursor 10. These \u201cgreen\u201d components (Nb filaments 14, Nb barrier 15, Cu matrix 17, and Sn 13 core) are then reacted using a specific heat treatment (usually with multiple temperature holds) in order to activate the Nb3Sn formation [5] creating the superconductor. It has been noted that this heat treatment can have a large influence on the final superconducting properties of the strand. For over 50 years since the advent of internal tin Nb3Sn superconducting wires, the Nb3Sn reaction heat treatment has followed a similar multiple temperature/time stage pattern. In the past, the heat treatments of Nb3Sn wires have used many temperature holds (or dwells) which were designed to homogenize the Cu\u2014Sn mix before going through phase transitions [6]\u2014as well as to avoid porosity [7]. The different dwells historically used for Internal-Tin Nb3Sn strands as well as justification for their use are described below.",
                        "1. Initial Tin Mixing Dwell: 210-215\u00b0 C.: This dwell is used often to homogenize the Cu\u2014Sn mix as much as possible to transform the pure Sn into the \u03b7 phase before crossing the melting temperature of pure Sn at 227\u00b0 C. (as to prevent its liquefaction) [8]. It has also been suggested that this dwell will \u201cwet\u201d the grain boundaries and prevent porosity. Time length of dwell is typically 24-100 hours.",
                        "2. Bronze Phase Mixing Dwell: either (a) 340\u00b0 C.: This dwell is used in strands with relatively low Sn content strands designed for low AC losses. This dwell was suggested to homogenize as much as possible before crossing the formation temperature of the \u03b4 phase, since it has been implied that this phase is related to porosity[9] or (b) 400\u00b0 C.: This dwell is associated with strands with relatively high Sn content designed for maximum critical current density. As seen in FIG. 2, This dwell was suggested to mix the Cu\u2014Sn as much as possible to transform the \u03b7 phase 18 into the \u03f5 phase 19 [10]\u2014before crossing the melting temperature of the \u03b7 phase [8]. However it should be mentioned that the mixing was expected to happen within the filaments [4] instead of inside the core, as the Sn\u2014Nb\u2014Cu ternary membrane 20 permits.",
                        "3. Bridging prevention dwell: 450\u00b0 C.: This dwell is used in strands with relatively low Sn content strands designed for low AC losses. This dwell is reported to produce a significant amount of porosity that could prevent filament bridging (if this is desired) [11].",
                        "4. Distribution of Bronze Throughout the Filament Pack Dwell: 575\u00b0 C.: This dwell is reported as a compromise between minimum Nb3Sn formation and uniform distribution of Sn within the filaments [10], to homogenize the phase surrounding the filaments before the reaction to form Nb3Sn takes place.",
                        "5. Nb3Sn Reaction Dwell: 620\u00b0 C.-700\u00b0 C.: This final dwell is the Nb3Sn reaction stage, where Nb reacts with Sn in the presence of Cu to form Nb3Sn."

                        "For many years it has been noticed that, as shown in FIG. 3, some Nb3Sn ends up disconnected 21 from the main ring [12] and therefore cannot contribute to current transport. This disconnection is a result of the Sn\u2014Nb\u2014Cu ternary phase, identified as (Nb0.75Cu0.25)Sn2 [13] and denominated \u201cNausite\u201d, which forms at two instances during heat treatment:",
                        "1. The first formation of Nausite has the shape of a ring (or a membrane) that sits between the Cu/Nb filament pack and the Cu\u2014Sn core (as seen in FIG. 2). This Nausite membrane 20 is formed below 408\u00b0 C. (the melting temperature of the Cu\u2014Sn phase \u03b7 or Cu6Sn5). When formed, the Nausite membrane enables Cu diffusion to the core while blocking Sn diffusion outwards. Such Cu diffusion is beneficial to consume the \u03b7 phase and produce more of the \u03f5 phase with a higher melting point. Unfortunately the membrane grows with time, producing more Nausite that results in disconnected Nb3Sn as previously stated. It does not appear of critical importance if this stage is preceded or not by a 210-215\u00b0 C. Internal Tin Mixing dwell stage.",
                        "2. The second formation of Nausite 22 happens above 408\u00b0 C. upon the liquefaction of the \u03b7 phase, and as shown in FIG. 4 it manifests in very large grains. The liquid corrodes the Nb filaments and produces large pieces of Nausite 23 rapidly which (as before) result in disconnected Nb3Sn.",
                        "The novel heat treatment process described herein uses the Nausite membrane advantageously in order to diffuse the highest amount of Cu into the core (consuming as much \u03b7 as possible and therefore preventing liquefaction) while at the same time inhibiting the growth of the Nausite as a membrane.",
                        "A difference between the novel heat treatment process described herein and those of the prior art described above is that the novel heat treatment process described herein doesn't focus on phase transformations or porosity. Rather, the present heat treatment process focuses on the formation of a Nausite membrane in order to facilitate the Cu diffusion to the core and prevent the liquefaction of \u03b7 as much as possible.",
                        "The Nausite membrane can form in as little as 8 hours between 400\u00b0 C. and 350\u00b0 C. FIG. 5 shows the Nausite membrane thickness growth as a function of time. Since the Nausite phase produces disconnected Nb3Sn, lower temperatures are desired; however this membrane doesn't seem to grow continuously below 300\u00b0 C. Once the membrane is formed, the Cu diffusion is activated, a diffusion which is weakly dependent on temperature between 400\u00b0 C. and 370\u00b0 C. as is shown in FIG. 6. It should be noted that the Cu diffusion slows down to impractical amounts below 350\u00b0 C.",
                        "The heat treatment process described hererin recommends the replacement of the previously thought as a Bronze Phase Mixing Dwell with a Cu Diffusion Dwell of \u02dc350-380\u00b0 C. for >100 hours. For example, one dwell of 370\u00b0 C. for 104 hours resulted in a Nausite layer thickness reduction of 46%. Due to the reduced formation of Nausite, as well as the increased Cu diffusion, this heat treatment has improved the critical current density (at 16 T) of the wires with sub-element size of 35 \u03bcm by 27% as shown in FIG. 7. Furthermore, a 360\u00b0 C. dwell for 150 hours results in a Nausite layer thickness reduction of 54% (critical current density not measured).",
                        "Since at higher temperatures the Nausite membrane grows rapidly, the heat treatment dwell is recommended to be between 350\u00b0 C. to 380\u00b0 C., and for longer than 100 hours in order to diffuse as much Cu into the core to maximize conversion of \u03b7 phase bronze to \u03f5 phase bronze. Practical limitations of the dwell time are to a maximum of approximately 400 hours. In a preferred embodiment, the heat treatment process may feature a heat treatment of 370\u00b0 C./104 hr+665\u00b0 C./50 hrs."

These strands were manufactured from the same design to the same final diameter of 0.7 mm but nonetheless had a range in superconducting properties when heat treated with the standard heat treatment sequence: ramp from room temperature to 210\u00b0 C. at a ramp rate of 25\u00b0 C./hour, dwell of 210\u00b0 C. for 48 hours, ramp to 400\u00b0 C. at a ramp rate of 50\u00b0 C./hour, dwell of 400\u00b0 C. for 48 hours, and ramp to 650\u00b0 C. at a ramp rate of 75\u00b0 C./hour, dwell of 650\u00b0 C. for 50-hours. FIG. 7 shows the Critical Current (Ic) at 4.2K and in an applied magnetic field of 12 T for the standard heat treatment and the heat treatment with a modified Cu mixing dwell, ramp from room temperature to 370\u00b0 C. at a ramp rate of 25\u00b0 C./hour, dwell of 370\u00b0 C. for 104 hours, ramp to 650\u00b0 C. at a ramp rate of 75\u00b0 C./hour, dwell of 650\u00b0 C. for 50 hours. This particular wire saw an increase of 15% in critical current at 12 T and 27% increase in critical current at 15 T when the new heat treatment was applied. This heat treatment allowed producing a Nausite membrane that is 46% thinner than that produced in the standard heat treatment and increased the Cu content in the core by 9% as shown in FIG. 8.",
