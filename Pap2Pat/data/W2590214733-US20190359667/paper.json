    "abstract": "The transforming growth factor \u03b2 isoforms, TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22, and -\u03b23, are small secreted homodimeric signaling proteins with essential roles in regulating the adaptive immune system and maintaining the extracellular matrix. However, dysregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway is responsible for promoting the progression of several human diseases, including cancer and fibrosis. Despite the known importance of TGF-\u03b2s in promoting disease progression, no inhibitors have been approved for use in humans. Herein, we describe an engineered TGF-\u03b2 monomer, lacking the heel helix, a structural motif essential for binding the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) but dispensable for binding the other receptor required for TGF-\u03b2 signaling, the TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (T\u03b2RII), as an alternative therapeutic modality for blocking TGF-\u03b2 signaling in humans. As shown through binding studies and crystallography, the engineered monomer retained the same overall structure of native TGF-\u03b2 monomers and bound T\u03b2RII in an identical manner. Cell-based luciferase assays showed that the engineered monomer functioned as a dominant negative to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling with a Ki of 20-70 nm Investigation of the mechanism showed that the high affinity of the engineered monomer for T\u03b2RII, coupled with its reduced ability to non-covalently dimerize and its inability to bind and recruit T\u03b2RI, enabled it to bind endogenous T\u03b2RII but prevented it from binding and recruiting T\u03b2RI to form a signaling complex. Such engineered monomers provide a new avenue to probe and manipulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling and may inform similar modifications of other TGF-\u03b2 family members.",

                                "The structures of the TGF-\u2424 receptor complexes (8,9), as well as accompanying binding and cross-linking studies with TGF-\u24243 C77S (7,8,37), suggested that the signaling capacity of monomeric TGF-\u2424s (TGF-\u24241 C77S or mTGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243 C77S or mTGF-\u24243) arise from their ability to non-covalently dimerize and in turn bind their receptors (Fig. 1, A andC). This led to our hypothesis that it should be possible to diminish or completely eliminate receptor complex assembly with monomeric TGF-\u2424s by removing or altering residues responsible for dimer formation and binding of T\u2424RI. The structural motif that likely contributes the greatest to self-association of the monomers is the \"heel\" \u2423-helix, \u2423-helix 3 (Fig. 1A). This helix is highly amphipathic and has numerous hydrophobic interactions with residues that line the \"palm\" of the opposing monomer (Fig. 1B). This helix also forms a large portion of the binding surface for T\u2424RI (Fig. 1C). Thus, it was hypothesized that elimination of \u2423-helix 3 should interfere with both self-association of the monomers and binding of T\u2424RI, but it should not impair T\u2424RII binding as this occurs through the ligand fingertips far away from \u2423-helix 3 (Fig. 1A).",
                                "To evaluate this hypothesis, bacterial expression constructs were generated for TGF-\u24241, TGF-\u24242, and TGF-\u24243 in which residues 52-71 were eliminated and Cys-77 was substituted with serine. This corresponds to deletion of all of \u2423-helix 3, as well as five flanking residues on the N-terminal end and three flanking residues on the C-terminal end (Fig. 1D). The length of the deletion was chosen so as to leave a sufficient number of residues between the last residue of \u2424-strand 4 (Gly-48) and the first residue of \u2424-strand 5 (Cys-77/Ser-77) to form an unconstrained loop that bridges \u2424-strands 4 and 5. Although a secondary consideration, either two (TGF-\u24242) or three (TGF-\u24241 and -\u24243) of the loop-forming residues were also substituted so as to increase the net overall charge at pH 7.0 for the full-length TGF-\u24241, -\u24242, and -\u24243 monomers from \u03ea0.9, \u03e91.1, and \u03e94.4 to \u03ea3.1, \u03e93.9, and \u03e96.1 for the constructs in which \u2423-helix 3 was deleted (Fig. 1D). The rationale for this was that the solubility of the monomers, which like the homodimers are poor from pH 4.5 to 9.5 (see Fig. 4, A and B, below), might be improved by both removing hydrophobic \u2423-helix 3 and by artificially increasing the net charge at pH 7.0."

                                "The TGF-\u24241, -\u24242, and -\u24243 \"mini-monomers\" described above, designated mmTGF-\u24241, mmTGF-\u24242, and mmTGF-\u24243, were expressed in Escherichia coli and accumulated in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated, and after reconstitution and purification in denaturant, the mini-monomers were renatured by dilution into CHAPScontaining buffer at pH 9.0 as described previously (38). The folding of the mini-monomers differed greatly; a large portion of the mmTGF-\u24242 remained soluble during the folding and yielded large amounts of monomeric protein after purification by cation exchange chromatography, whereas only a small amount of mmTGF-\u24241 and mmTGF-\u24243 remained soluble during the folding, and either no monomeric protein (TGF-\u24241) or a very small amount of monomeric protein (TGF-\u24243) was obtained after purification by cation exchange chromatography. This pattern mirrors the pattern previously observed for the folding of TGF-\u2424 homodimers from full-length wild type monomers (38) and likely reflects differences in the intrinsic propensity of the monomers to properly form the four intramolecular disulfides characteristic of each monomer. mmTGF-\u24242 was the least desired variant, due to the expected low affinity for binding T\u2424RII. However, this was considered an addressable concern based on our prior studies, which demonstrated that substitution of Lys-25, Ile-92, and Lys-94 in TGF-\u24242 with the corresponding residues in TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243 engendered TGF-\u24242 with the ability to bind T\u2424RII with high affinity (39,40).",
                                "To determine whether mmTGF-\u24242 was suitable for further development in the manner described above, it was characterized in terms of its folding, solubility, and receptor binding properties.

                                "\u24242 was prepared and examined by recording a two-dimensional 1 H-15 N shift correlation spectrum (Fig. 2A). This revealed a highly dispersed spectrum characteristic of natively folded protein. The spectrum could be fully assigned, and analysis of the assigned chemical shifts to identify secondary structure propensities showed that the protein had the expected secondary structure, particularly in the palm region formed by the cystine knot and the finger region where T\u2424RII binds (supplemental Fig. S2A). This analysis further showed that the newly created loop between residues 47 and 56 had near zero probability of forming either an \u2423-helix or \u2424-strand, suggesting that it is likely flexible as would be expected for a loop of this length connecting two antiparallel \u2424-strands. This was directly confirmed by an analysis of backbone 15 N T 2 values. These values provide information about motions on fast (nanosecond-picosecond) and intermediate (microsecond-millisecond) time scales and were significantly elevated in the region corresponding to the newly created loop relative to the other parts of the protein (supplemental Fig. S2B), which, except for the N terminus and the short loop connecting \u2423-helix 1 and \u2424-strand 1, are expected to be structurally well-ordered.",
                                "To directly examine the three-dimensional structure, mmTGF-\u24242 was crystallized, and its structure was determined to a resolution of 1.8 \u00c5 using molecular replacement (Table 1). The overall fold of mmTGF-\u24242 was shown to be highly similar to that previously determined for TGF-\u24242, with the exception of the newly created loop, which was shown to take the place of \u2423-helix 3 as anticipated (Fig. 2B). Superposition of the mmTGF-\u24242 with the monomer from the structure of TGF-\u24242 shows that there is a systematic displacement of up to about 1.5 \u00c5 of the finger region of mmTGF-\u24242 relative to TGF-\u24242. Such differences appear to be the result of bending of the monomer near the center of the finger region and not a change in the structure of the finger region, as superimposition of the fingers alone show that they correspond closely, with a backbone r.m.s.d. of under 0.2 \u00c5 and similar orientations of the side chains of several residues that pack and stabilize the fingers (Fig. 2D). Such bending is also supported by an overlay of the two molecules of mmTGF-\u24242 present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, which also exhibit a smaller but still noticeable displacement of the finger regions relative to one another (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the NMR analysis, not only was the electron density noticeably weaker in the region corresponding to the newly created loop, but also it was shown to adopt different orientations for the two molecules from the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2C).",
                                "The similar folding of mmTGF-\u24242 relative to TGF-\u24242, especially in the T\u2424RII-binding finger region, suggested that it would also bind T\u2424RII in a similar manner. To evaluate this, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed in which the same concentration series of T\u2424RII was injected over TGF-\u24242 and mmTGF-\u24242 immobilized on separate flow cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Although it was not possible to quantitate affinity due to weak binding, the sensorgrams nonetheless showed similar shapes and concentration dependence. These sensorgrams show that mmTGF-\u24242 binds T\u2424RII weakly, consistent with earlier reports (39), and that it does so in a manner qualitatively similar to TGF-\u24242.",
                                "The solubility of mmTGF-\u24242 appeared to be significantly better than that of TGF-\u24242 and the full-length TGF-\u24242 monomer, mTGF-\u24242, as samples of the former could be readily prepared at concentrations of 2-3 mg ml \u03ea1 without noticeable precipitation at pH 7.0, whereas samples of the latter two proteins were completely precipitated under these same conditions. To quantitate solubility, TGF-\u24242, mTGF-\u24242, and mmTGF-\u24242 were prepared as concentrated stocks in 100 mM acetic acid, pH 2.9, where they were readily soluble and then diluted into PBS, pH 7.4. The light scattering at 340 nM was measured to assess precipitation, and then the samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance at 280 nM was measured to assess the protein concentration. This demonstrated that TGF-\u24242 and mTGF-\u24242 were both effectively insoluble at neutral pH over the entire concentration range evaluated (7-100 M) (Fig. 4, A andB). This is consistent with the known poor solubility of the TGF-\u2424 homodimers (41), but it shows that this property also extends to full-length monomeric TGF-\u2424s.",
                                "The mini-monomeric TGF-\u24242, mmTGF-\u24242, in contrast, exhibited modest light scattering and a corresponding modest reduction in the amount of soluble protein relative to that expected when the protein concentration was 40 M or higher, indicating that indeed mmTGF-\u24242 was reasonably soluble at neutral pH, although not perfectly so. This was reflected in NMR spectra, which showed that although 100 -200 M 15 N mmTGF-\u24242 samples could be readily prepared, the spectrum was nonetheless poor, with the only detectable signals arising from residues in the flexible parts of the protein, namely the N terminus, the exposed loop between \u2423-helix 1 and \u2424-strand 1, and the newly created loop between \u2424-strands 4 and 5. The fact that signals could only be detected from the flexible parts of the protein suggested that mmTGF-\u24242 forms large soluble aggregates under these conditions. Through trial and error, it was found that these soluble aggregates could be eliminated by addition of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS, with the majority of the NMR signals appearing at the concentration of 5 mM CHAPS and all of the NMR signals appearing at 10 mM CHAPS. Thus, all NMR spectra, including that shown in Fig. 2A, were recorded in the presence of 10 mM CHAPS."

To confer mmTGF-\u24242 with the ability to bind T\u2424RII with high affinity comparable with that of TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243, the three residues in mouse TGF-\u24242 shown previously to differ in the interface with T\u2424RII, Lys-25, Ile-92, and Asn-94 (40,42), were substituted with the corresponding residues from TGF-\u24241 and -\u24243, Arg-25, Val-92, and Arg-94 (Fig. 1,  E andF). In previous studies, substitution of these three residues was shown to be sufficient to confer TGF-\u24242 with a T\u2424RII binding affinity comparable with TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243 (39,40). Despite this, four additional residues peripheral to the T\u2424RIIbinding site that differed in TGF-\u24242 relative to TGF-\u24241 were also substituted with the corresponding residues from TGF-\u24241 (R26K, L89V, T95K, and I98V) (Fig. 1, E andF). Although previous results suggested this was not strictly necessary, it was nonetheless done to ensure that the precise orientation of residues in the mmTGF-\u24242-binding site for T\u2424RII matched as closely as possible with that in the high affinity TGF-\u2424 isoforms, TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243. The resulting construct bearing these seven amino acid substitutions, designated mmTGF-\u24242-7M (Fig. 1E, supplemental Fig. S1, and supplemental Table S1), was expressed in E. coli in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies.

The increase in the 15 N T 2 relaxation times in the region corresponding to the newly formed loop in mmTGF-\u24242-7M was comparable with that in mmTGF-\u24242 (supplemental Fig. S3B). This suggested that the missing density in the region corresponding to the newly formed loop in mmTGF-\u24242-7M, which among the three molecules in the asymmetric unit was observed for part of chain A and most of chain C, was not due to increased dynamics, but other factors, most likely the lower resolution of the mmTGF-\u24242-7M structure compared with the mmTGF-\u24242 structure (Table 1).",

                                "To further investigate the properties of mmTGF-\u24242-7M, a competition experiment was performed in which the same HEK293 luciferase reporter cell line was stimulated with a constant sub-EC 50 concentration of dimeric TGF-\u24241 (8.0 pM) and increasing concentrations of mTGF-\u24243 or mmTGF-\u24242-7M. The results showed that mTGF-\u24243 further stimulated signaling with a midpoint concentration similar to that of mTGF-\u24243 alone (Fig. 6B). The fitted EC 50 values confirm this, with an EC 50 of 182 \u03ee 16 pM for the data shown in Fig. 6A and EC 50 of 194 \u03ee 36 pM for the data shown in Fig. 6B. The behavior of mmTGF-\u24242-7M was very different, with no detectable change in the signaling activity when added up to concentrations of 10 nM, but with a sharp decrease to no detectable signaling activity when the concentration was increased to 100 nM (Fig. 6B). This shows that mmTGF-\u24242-7M indeed possesses no signaling activity and that it can function to completely block and inhibit TGF-\u2424 signaling. The normalized luciferase responses could be readily fitted to a standard model for ligand-dependent inhibition and yielded an IC 50 value of 68 \u03ee 7 nM. Similar experiments showed that mmTGF-\u24242-7M also functioned as a potent competitive inhibitor against the other TGF-\u2424 isoforms, TGF-\u24242 and TGF-\u24243, with measured IC 50 values (TGF-\u24242 IC 50 19 \u03ee 3 nM and TGF-\u24243 IC 50 21 \u03ee 8 nM) within a factor of 2-3 of that measured for TGF-\u24241 (supplemental Fig. S4, A andB). These IC 50 values are on the lower end of the range of affinities that have been reported for binding of the high affinity TGF-\u2424 isoforms to T\u2424RII, including mmTGF-\u24242-7M reported here (Table 2). This suggests that mmTGF-\u24242-7M functions to inhibit TGF-\u2424 signaling in the manner anticipated, which is by binding to and blocking endogenous T\u2424RII. The fact that the measured potency is greater than the greatest affinity previously reported for TGF-\u24241 and TGF-\u24243 binding to T\u2424RII (140 nM) (9), suggests that other factors, such as nonspecific association of mmTGF-\u24242-7M with the plasma membrane, may serve to potentiate its inhibitory activity.",
                                "The finding that mmTGF-\u24242-7M possesses no apparent signaling activity, and in fact functions as a low nanomolar inhibitor of TGF-\u2424 signaling, suggests that the elimination of \u2423-helix 3 in fact diminished non-covalent association of the monomers and greatly attenuated or abrogated T\u2424RI binding. To assess this directly, SPR experiments were performed to determine whether mmTGF-\u24242-7M could recruit T\u2424RI in the presence of T\u2424RII. To accomplish this, increasing concentrations of T\u2424RI and the same concentration series of T\u2424RI in the presence of near-saturating amounts of T\u2424RII (2 M) were injected over the same TGF-\u24243 and mmTGF-\u24242-7M SPR chip surfaces used for the T\u2424RII binding measurements described above. This showed that T\u2424RI alone binding is negligible to both TGF-\u24243 and mmTGF-\u24242-7M (Fig. 3, E andF), but unlike TGF-\u24243, T\u2424RII-bound mmTGF-\u24242-7M is unable to recruit T\u2424RI (Fig. 3,  G andH). This is consistent with the earlier result reported by Huang et al. (37) that T\u2424RII-bound mTGF-\u24243 was significantly or completely impaired in terms of its ability to bind and recruit T\u2424RI. This also provides further evidence that T\u2424RII-bound TGF-\u2424 monomers are incapable of binding and recruiting T\u2424RI, but because the mmTGF-\u24242-7M was immobilized on the surface of the sensor, it alone does not provide any insight as to whether mmTGF-\u24242-7M might be capable of non-covalently dimerizing and binding and recruiting T\u2424RI.",
                                "To address these questions directly, two solution-based techniques were used, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). The AUC experiments were performed by measuring the total UV absorbance at 280 nm as a function of the radial position and time as mTGF-\u24243, mmTGF-\u24242, and mmTGF-\u24242-7M were sedimented under acidic conditions, pH 3.8, where the monomers are fully soluble. The AUC data revealed parabolically shaped van Holde-Weischet sedimentation coefficient distribution plots for all three monomers (data not shown), consistent with each undergoing reversible self-association to form a dimer or other higher order oligomer. To determine more precisely which species might be present in solution, the data TGF-\u03b21 mTGF-\u03b23 mmTGF-\u03b22-7M "

S5-S7). The fitted parameters further showed that K D for self-association was 1 order of magnitude greater for mTGF-\u24243 compared with mmTGF-\u24242 and mmTGF-\u24242-7M. Thus, the removal of the heel helix, \u24233, does diminish selfassociation of the monomers to form dimers, but it does not completely abrogate dimer formation. TR-FRET was used to assess the ability of dimeric and monomeric TGF-\u2424s to bind and bring T\u2424RI and T\u2424RII together. This was accomplished by generating differentially tagged forms of T\u2424RII and T\u2424RI and in turn binding to these tags with proteins labeled with fluorescent donors and acceptors. T\u2424RII was tagged with a C-terminal His tag and was bound by a terbium cryptate-labeled anti-His monoclonal antibody fluorescent donor, and T\u2424RI was tagged with an N-terminal avitag, which after enzymatic biotinylation was bound to a dye-labeled (XL-665) streptavidin fluorescent acceptor (Fig. 7A). The addition of TGF-\u2424 to the tagged receptors brings them together and leads to a large increase in the \u232cF value, which is defined as the ratio of the acceptor and donor emission fluorescent intensities. The TR-FRET assay is demonstrated by the data presented in supplemental Fig. S8 and was used here to compare the ability of the TGF-\u24243 full-length monomer, mTGF-\u24243, and the TGF-\u24242 mini-monomer that binds T\u2424RII with high affinity, mmTGF-\u24242-7M, to bind and bring T\u2424RI and T\u2424RII together. The TR-FRET signal for mTGF-\u24243 was shown to be comparable with that of TGF-\u24243, and this did not depend on whether the TGF-\u2424 concentration was 100 or 250 nM (Fig. 7B). The TR-FRET signal of mmTGF-\u24242-7M was, in contrast, within the error limits of the buffer control, and this did not depend on the TGF-\u2424 concentration (Fig. 7B). These results demonstrate that under these conditions, mTGF-\u24243 retains full capacity to assemble a non-covalent dimeric complex with T\u2424RI and T\u2424RII, but under these same conditions, mmTGF-\u24242-7M has no capacity to do so. These results, together with the AUC results, suggest that the removal of the heel helix had the effects anticipated; its removal appears to have reduced, although did not eliminate, dimer formation, and even though dimers are still formed, they are evidently unable to bind and recruit T\u2424RI."

                                "The TGF-\u2424s are responsible for promoting the progression of numerous human diseases (11)(12)(13)44), yet despite nearly 2 decades of preclinical studies and clinical trials, no inhibitors have been approved for use in humans. The results presented here demonstrate that an engineered TGF-\u2424 monomer, lacking Cys-77 and the heel \u2423-helix (\u24233), functions to potently block and inhibit signaling of the TGF-\u24241, -\u24242, and -\u24243 with IC 50 values in the range of 20 -70 nM (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S4). This novel inhibitor has several attributes that may overcome limitations that have been encountered with other classes of inhibitors, for example the natural high specificity of TGF-\u2424 and thus the inhibitor for T\u2424RII may engender it with much greater specificity, and thus fewer undesirable side effects, compared with the much more promiscuous TGF-\u2424 kinase inhibitors. The small size of the inhibitor (\u03f310 kDa) may further engender it with a much greater ability to penetrate tumors and other dense tissues where the TGF-\u2424s drive disease progression, a distinct advantage compared with IgG antibodies, which are much larger (\u03f3150 kDa) and tend to occupy only the vascular and interstitial space of well perfused organs (31,32). The other advantages of this novel inhibitor include its high intrinsic stability, because of the four intramolecular disulfide bonds that tie the four fingers together, and the fact that it is highly soluble in water at neutral pH, unlike native TGF-\u2424 dimers or full-length TGF-\u2424 monomers.",
                                "The structures of TGF-\u2424 receptor complexes, together with the previously published chemical cross-linking data, suggested that the potent signaling activity of TGF-\u24241 C77S and TGF-\u24243 C77S was due to the ability of the monomers to non-covalently dimerize and in turn assemble a (T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII) 2 heterotetramer. The results presented here, namely the AUC experiments that were used to assess non-covalent dimer formation and the TR-FRET experiments that were used to assess assembly of complexes with T\u2424RI and T\u2424RII, provided further evidence for this. The AUC data showed that full-length monomeric TGF-\u24243, mTGF-\u24243, self-associates to form dimers with a dimerization constant of 4.1 M (Table 3). The TR-FRET data showed that at a concentration of 0.1 or 0.25 M and in the presence of comparable concentrations of the T\u2424RI and T\u2424RII ectodomains, mTGF-\u24243 assembles T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complexes to the same extent as dimeric TGF-\u24243 (Fig. 7B). That this occurs, even under conditions where the mTGF-\u24243 concentrations (0.1-0.25 M, Fig. 7B) were more than an order of magnitude below the K D value for self-association (4.1 M, Table 3), indicates that receptor binding also contributes significantly to assembly of T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complexes. The assembly of T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complexes with mTGF-\u24243, and presumably mTGF-\u24241 as well, therefore appears to be a cooperative process, much like protein folding, in which multiple weaker interactions, including monomer-monomer, non-covalent dimer-receptor, and receptor-receptor interactions, cooperate to enable formation of a thermodynamically stable TGF-\u2424\u2150T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complex. This manner of cooperative assembly is likely responsible for the ability of mTGF-\u24241 and mTGF-\u24243 to induce signaling at concentrations that are more than 4 orders of magnitude below the K D value for self-association of the monomers (EC 50 values of about 0.1 nM versus K D values for self-association of 4.1 M).",
                                "The elimination of the heel helix from the TGF-\u2424 monomer was shown to be very effective in terms of blocking the cooperative assembly of T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complexes as shown by the TR-FRET data (Fig. 7B) and the cell based signaling data (Fig. 6, A andB). The AUC data showed that elimination of the heel helix led to the weakening of the monomer-monomer interaction by 1 order of magnitude (Table 3). The SPR data shown in Fig. 3,G and H, further showed that the T\u2424RII-bound form of mmTGF-\u24242-7M was incapable of binding and recruiting T\u2424RI, which is completely expected based on published structures of TGF-\u2424 receptor complexes that show that T\u2424RI binds to a composite interface formed by both chains of TGF-\u2424, as well as T\u2424RII (8,9). Thus, the data show that the reduced propensity of the engineered monomer to self-associate, together with what would be expected to be very weak binding of T\u2424RI to any dimers that do form, is responsible for the inability of mmTGF-\u24242-7M to assemble a T\u2424RI\u2150T\u2424RII complex. This accounts for the lack of signaling activity, and this together with the retention of high affinity T\u2424RII binding accounts for the inhibitory activity.",
                                "The other type II receptors of the family, activin type II receptor II, activin type IIB receptor, BMP type II receptor, and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone type II receptor, have either been shown or are predicted to bind the GF knuckle and not the GF fingertips, as does T\u2424RII (1). Nonetheless, they share the same property as T\u2424RII in that they bind only by contacting residues from a single GF monomer and not both monomers as has been shown or is predicted for all type I receptors of the family (1). This, together with the structures reported here that show that it is possible to remove \u24233 without affecting the overall structure of the monomer (Figs. 2, B-D, and5, B-E), suggests that it might be possible to generate monomers of other GFs of the family lacking the heel helix that function as inhibitors. These types of inhibitors have numerous potential applications, ranging from research tools for probing roles of specific ligands in vivo to clinically useful inhibitors for treating disease, which are driven by hyperactive signaling by other ligands of the family, such as cancer cachexia by activin (45)."

Biotinylated avitagged TGF-\u24243 or avi-tagged TGF-\u24242-7M was bound to a C4 reverse phase column equilibrated with 94.9% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient.",
                                "SPR measurements shown in Fig. 3, A-F, were performed in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P-20 (GE Healthcare)) with the receptor indicated injected over a series of 2-fold dilutions over the concentration range shown. Injections were carried out in duplicate and included 10 buffer blank injections at the start of the experiment. Injections were performed for 2-3 min at a flow rate of 100 l min \u03ea1 , followed by a dissociation for 1 min or longer in which buffer alone was injected. Each cycle of injection was followed by a 30-s injection of 4 M guanidine\u2150HCl, 2 M NaCl. Data were processed by subtracting both the response from a blank flow cell as well as buffer blanks using the program Scrubber2 (Biologic software, Campbell, Australia). Kinetic fitting of the data was performed with Scrubber2 assuming a simple 1:1 binding model. SPR measurements shown in Fig. 3, G and H, were performed similarly, except 2 M T\u2424RII was included in both the running buffer and the injected samples."

Initially, 20 M binary complexes of TGF-\u24243\u2150T\u2424RII-His, mTGF-\u24243\u2150T\u2424RII-His, and mmTGF-\u24242-7M\u2150T\u2424RII-His were formed in a 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, buffer and stored at 4 \u00b0C. A TR-FRET assay based on the proximity-dependent transfer of fluorescence from the donor terbium cryptate-labeled anti-His mAb (terbium-anti-His, Cis-Bio, Bedford, MA) to the acceptor XL665-labeled streptavidin (SA-665, CisBio, Bedford, MA) was used to monitor the assembly of ternary ligand\u2150T\u2424RII-His\u2150biotinylated T\u2424RI-\u232cC-Avi complexes. 50-l assays containing 100 or 250 nM TGF-\u24243\u2150T\u2424RII-His (1:2), mTGF-\u24243\u2150T\u2424RII-His (1:1), and mmTGF-\u24242-7M\u2150T\u2424RII-His (1:1) complexes were incubated with 50 nM biotinylated T\u2424RI-\u232cC-Avi. Each 50-l ternary complex formation assay also contained 2 nM terbium-anti-His and 30 nM SA-665 and was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Each condition was tested in replicates of six. Buffer control (n \u03ed 6) contained only 2 nM terbium-anti-His and 30 nM SA-XL665. The buffer conditions for each assay were 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The assays were performed in Corning black 384 well low flange microplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After a 2-h incubation, the assay plate was measured for terbium/XL-665 TR-FRET on a BMG Labtech Pherastar FS multimode plate reader (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC). An optic module containing 337-, 490-, and 665-nm filters was used to monitor TR-FRET producing raw data for 337/490 (terbium emission) and 337/665 (XL-665) emission. The ratio of 665 emission/490 emission was determined for each condition and was subsequently used to calculate \u232cF, which is a measure that reflects the signal of the sample versus the background. \u232cF was calculated using the following equation: (ratio signal \u03ea ratio negative / ratio negative ) \u03eb 100. The ratio signal refers to the assays containing the trimeric complexes or buffer control. The ratio negative refers to two buffer control assays (2 nM terbium-anti-His and 30 nM SA-665). For the buffer control, 2 of the 6 replicates were assigned as negative controls for the purpose of calculating \u232cF. \u232cF was calculated for the remaining four buffer control replicates."

The sedimentation velocity data were initially fitted with the twodimensional spectrum analysis, as described previously (66), to remove time-and radially-invariant noise from the raw data and to fit the meniscus position. Subsequently, the data were fitted to a discrete monomer-dimer model using the adaptive space-time finite element method (67) and genetic algorithms for the parameter optimization (68). The monomer-dimer model accounts for mass action and the reversible association behavior, fitting the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic parameters, as well as the partial specific volume while assuming the predicted molar mass for either wild type or mutant. A Monte Carlo analysis (69) with 100 iterations was performed for each dataset to obtain fitting statistics. Buffer density and viscosity were estimated with UltraScan based on buffer composition, and all hydrodynamic values were corrected for standard conditions (20 \u00b0C and water). The fitting results provided an excellent fit with random residuals and very low r.m.s.d. values (see supplemental material and Figs. 456). All results are summarized in Table 3.",
