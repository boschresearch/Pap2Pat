The recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers lack the ability to bind and recruit TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2R1), but retain the capacity to bind the high affinity TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (T\u03b2RII), and in some instances, include mutations that increase their affinity for T\u03b2RII. Nucleic acid molecules and vectors encoding the recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers are also described. Isolated cells, such as T cells, can be re-programmed with a TGF-\u03b2 monomer-encoding nucleic acid or vector to secrete the monomer. Use of the recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers and/or cells producing the recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers, to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling, such as to treat disorders associated with aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signaling, are also described.",

The three mammalian TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22 and -\u03b23, exert their functions through a cell surface receptor complex composed of type I (T\u03b2RI) and type II (T\u03b2RII) serine/threonine kinase receptors. Receptor activation induces both SMAD proteins and other downstream targets, including Ras, RhoA, TAK1, MEKK1, PI3K, and PP2A, to produce the full spectrum of TGF-\u03b2 responses (Roberts and Wakefield, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:8621-8623, 2003; Derynck and Zhang, Nature 425:577-584, 2003; Massague, Cell 134:215-230, 2008).",

The role of TGF-\u03b2 in cancer is multi-faceted.

Fibrotic disorders include, but are not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, liver cirrhosis, kidney fibrosis (such as from damage caused by diabetes), atrial fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis and scleroderma. Fibrosis can also occur as a result of surgical complications, chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation, injury or burns.",
                                "Fusion protein: A protein comprising at least a portion of two different (heterologous) proteins. In some embodiments herein, the fusion protein includes a TGF-\u03b2 monomer fused to a protein tag, an Fc domain (such as a human Fc domain) or albumin",

The level and type of glycosylation can vary in different host organisms used for recombinant expression. Novel glycosylation site can be sequence engineered by introducing glycosylation sequons in solvent exposed regions of the protein. For example, the N-glycosylation sequon NX[S/T] can be introduced at one or more places within the sequence of certain embodiments disclosed herein. Varying the type and extent of glycosylation has practical application in modulating solubility, function and half-life, as well as enabling site-specific chemical conjugation.",

Nucleic acids and proteins that have been \u201cisolated\u201d include nucleic acids and proteins purified by standard purification methods. The term also embraces nucleic acids and proteins prepared by recombinant expression in a host cell as well as chemically synthesized nucleic acids.",

In some embodiments herein, the recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers have been engineered to prevent dimerization. In other embodiments herein, the recombinant TGF-\u03b2 monomers which have been engineered to prevent their direct dimerization can be fused to heterologous proteins that are themselves capable of dimerization (e.g., an Fc domain of an IgG).",

PEGylation is routinely achieved by incubation of a reactive derivative of PEG with the target molecule. The covalent attachment of PEG to a drug or therapeutic protein can mask the agent from the host's immune system (reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity), and increase the hydrodynamic size (size in solution) of the agent, which prolongs its circulatory time by reducing renal clearance. PEGylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic drugs and proteins.",

Examples of conservative substitutions are shown below.",
                                "Conservative substitutions generally maintain (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain.",
                                "The substitutions which in general are expected to produce the greatest changes in protein properties will be non-conservative, for instance changes in which (a) a hydrophilic residue, for example, serine or threonine, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, for example, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine or alanine; (b) a cysteine or proline is substituted for (or by) any other residue; (c) a residue having an electropositive side chain, for example, lysine, arginine, or histidine, is substituted for (or by) an electronegative residue, for example, glutamine or aspartic acid; or (d) a residue having a bulky side chain, for example, phenylalanine, is substituted for (or by) one not having a side chain, for example, glycine.",

                                "Recombinant: A recombinant nucleic acid or protein is one that has a sequence that is not naturally occurring or has a sequence that is made by an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence. This artificial combination is often accomplished by chemical synthesis or by the artificial manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids, for example, by genetic engineering techniques. The term recombinant includes nucleic acids and proteins that have been altered by addition, substitution, or deletion of a portion of a natural nucleic acid molecule or protein.",
                                "Sequence identity/similarity: The identity between two or more nucleic acid sequences, or two or more amino acid sequences, is expressed in terms of the identity or similarity between the sequences. Sequence identity can be measured in terms of percentage identity; the higher the percentage, the more identical the sequences are. Sequence similarity can be measured in terms of percentage similarity (which takes into account conservative amino acid substitutions); the higher the percentage, the more similar the sequences are. Homologs or orthologs of nucleic acid or amino acid sequences possess a relatively high degree of sequence identity/similarity when aligned using standard methods. This homology is more significant when the orthologous proteins or cDNAs are derived from species which are more closely related (such as human and mouse sequences), compared to species more distantly related (such as human and C. elegans sequences).",

For instance, parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that are pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluid vehicles such as water, physiological saline, other balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like. For solid compositions (e.g., powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, pH buffering agents, or the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.

Topical preparations can include eye drops, ointments, sprays, patches and the like. Inhalation preparations can be liquid (e.g., solutions or suspensions) and include mists, sprays and the like. Oral formulations can be liquid (e.g., syrups, solutions or suspensions), or solid (e.g., powders, pills, tablets, or capsules). Suppository preparations can also be solid, gel, or in a suspension form.

To generate a TGF-13 monomer that would function as an inhibitor, rather than a stimulator of TGF-beta signaling, an engineered monomer was produced in which the primary dimerization motif, the interfacial \u03b1-helix, \u03b13, was replaced with a flexible loop (FIGS. 1A and 1D). It was reasoned that this would interfere with the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to dimerize and recruit MI by (a) limiting the potential of the monomers to non-covalently dimerize due to hydrophobic contacts (FIG. 1B) and (b) by eliminating a significant portion of the contact surface for the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor, MI, that binds by straddling the TGF-beta dimer interface (FIG. 1C).",

The ratio of 665 emission/490 emission was determined for each condition and was subsequently used to calculate \u0394F, which is a measure that reflects the signal of the sample versus the background. \u0394F was calculated using the following equation: (Ratiosignal-Rationegative/Rationegative)\u00d7100. The Ratiosignal refers to the assays containing the trimeric complexes or buffer control. The Rationegative refers to two assays buffer control (2 nM Tb-anti-His and 30 nM SA-665).

Three hundred scans were collected in intensity mode on a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at the CAUMA facility at the UTHSCSA. Data analysis was performed with UltraScan release 2130 (Demeler and Gorbet, Analytical ultracentrifugation data analysis with Ultrascan-III, In Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Instrumentation, Software, and Applications (Uchiyama, S., Stafford, W., and Laue, T., Eds.), pp 119-143, Springer, 2016; Demeler et al., A comprehensive data analysis package for analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, 2016), calculations were performed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center on Lonestar-5. The sedimentation velocity data were initially fitted with the two-dimensional spectrum analysis as described in (Demeler, Curr Protoc Protein Sci Chapter 7, Unit 7 13, 2010) to remove time- and radially invariant noise from the raw data, and to fit the meniscus position. Subsequently, the data were fitted to a discrete monomer-dimer model using the adaptive space-time finite element method (Cao and Demeler, Biophys J 95, 54-65, 2008) and genetic algorithms for the parameter optimization (Demeler et al., Macromol Biosci 10, 775-782, 2010). The monomer-dimer model accounts for mass action and the reversible association behavior, fitting the KD, hydrodynamic parameters, as well as the partial specific volume while assuming the predicted molar mass for either wildtype or mutant. A Monte Carlo analysis (Demeler and Brookes, Colloid Polym Sci 286, 129-137, 2008) with 100 iterations was performed for each dataset to obtain fitting statistics. Buffer density and viscosity were estimated with UltraScan based on buffer composition and all hydrodynamic values were corrected for standard conditions (20\u00b0 C. and water). The fitting results provided an excellent fit with random residuals and very low RMSD values. All results are summarized in Table 4, and FIGS. 11-13.",

                                "Design of Engineered Mini-Monomeric TGF-\u03b2 (mmTGF-\u03b2)",
                                "The structures of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor complexes (Groppe et al., Mol Cell 29, 157-168, 2008; Radaev et al., J Biol Chem 285:14806-14814, 2010), as well as accompanying binding and cross-linking studies with TGF-\u03b23 C77S (Ztilliga et al., J Mol Biol 354, 1052-1068, 2005; Groppe et al., Mol Cell 29, 157-168, 2008; Huang et al., EMBO J 30:1263-1276, 2011), suggested that the signaling capacity of monomeric TGF-\u03b2s (TGF-\u03b21 C77S or mTGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 C77S or mTGF-\u03b23) arise from their ability to non-covalently dimerize and in turn bind their receptors (FIGS. 1A and 1C). This led to the hypothesis that it should be possible to diminish or completely eliminate receptor complex assembly with monomeric TGF-\u03b2s by removing or altering residues responsible for dimer formation and binding of T\u03b2RI. The structural motif that likely contributes the greatest to self-association of the monomers is the \u201cheel\u201d \u03b1-helix, \u03b1-helix 3 (FIG. 1A). This helix is highly amphipathic and has numerous hydrophobic interactions with residues that line the \u201cpalm\u201d of the opposing monomer (FIG. 1B). This helix also forms a large portion of the binding surface for T\u03b2RI (FIG. 1C). Thus, it was hypothesized that elimination of \u03b1-helix 3 would interfere with both self-association of the monomers and binding of T\u03b2RI, but would not impair T\u03b2RII binding as this occurs through the ligand fingertips far away from \u03b1-helix 3 (FIG. 1A).",
                                "To evaluate this hypothesis, bacterial expression constructs were generated for TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22, and TGF-\u03b23 in which residues 52-71 were eliminated and Cys-77 was substituted with serine. This corresponds to deletion of all of \u03b1-helix 3, as well as five flanking residues on the N-terminal end and three flanking residues on the C-terminal end (FIG. 1D). The length of the deletion was chosen so as to leave a sufficient number of residues between the last residue of \u03b2-strand 4 (Gly-48) and the first residue of \u03b2-strand 5 (Cys-77/Ser-77) to form an unconstrained loop that bridges \u03b2-strands 4 and 5. Although a secondary consideration, either two (TGF-\u03b22) or three (TGF-\u03b21 and -\u03b23) of the loop-forming residues were also substituted to increase the net overall charge at pH 7.0 for the full-length TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22, and -\u03b23 monomers from \u22120.9, +1.1, and +4.4 to \u22123.1, +3.9, and +6.1, respectively, for the constructs in which \u03b1-helix 3 was deleted (FIG. 1D). The rationale for this was that the solubility of the monomers, which like the homodimers are poor from pH 4.5 to 9.5 (see FIGS. 4A and 4B), might be improved by both removing hydrophobic \u03b1-helix 3 and by artificially increasing the net charge at pH 7.0.",
                                "Isolation and Physical Characterization of mmTGF-f32",
                                "The TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22, and -\u03b23 \u201cmini-monomers\u201d described above, designated mmTGF-\u03b21, mmTGF-\u03b22, and mmTGF-\u03b23, were expressed in Escherichia coli and accumulated in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were isolated, and after reconstitution and purification in denaturant, the mini-monomers were renatured by dilution into CHAPS-containing buffer at pH 9.0 as described previously (Huang et al., Methods Mol Biol 1344:63-92, 2016). The folding of the mini-monomers differed greatly; a large portion of the mmTGF-\u03b22 remained soluble during the folding and yielded large amounts of monomeric protein after purification by cation exchange chromatography, whereas only a small amount of mmTGF-\u03b21 and mmTGF-\u03b23 remained soluble during the folding, and either no monomeric protein (TGF-\u03b21) or a very small amount of monomeric protein (TGF-\u03b23) was obtained after purification by cation exchange chromatography. This pattern mirrors the pattern previously observed for the folding of TGF-\u03b2 homodimers from full-length wild type monomers (Huang et al., Methods Mol Biol 1344:63-92, 2016) and likely reflects differences in the intrinsic propensity of the monomers to properly form the four intramolecular disulfides characteristic of each monomer. mmTGF-\u03b22 was the least desired variant, due to the expected low affinity for binding T\u03b2RII. However, this was considered an addressable concern based on prior studies, which demonstrated that substitution of Lys-25, Ile-92, and Lys-94 in TGF-\u03b22 with the corresponding residues in TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 engendered TGF-\u03b22 with the ability to bind T\u03b2RII with high affinity (Baardsnes et al., Biochemistry 48:2146-2155, 2009; De Crescenzo et al., J Mol Biol 355:47-62, 2006).",
                                "To determine whether mmTGF-\u03b22 was suitable for further development in the manner described above, it was characterized in terms of its folding, solubility, and receptor binding properties. To assess folding, a 15N-labeled sample of mmTGF-\u03b22 was prepared and examined by recording a two-dimensional 11-15N shift correlation spectrum (FIG. 2A). This revealed a highly dispersed spectrum characteristic of natively folded protein. The spectrum could be fully assigned, and analysis of the assigned chemical shifts to identify secondary structure propensities showed that the protein had the expected secondary structure, particularly in the palm region formed by the cysteine knot and the finger region where T\u03b2RII binds (FIG. 9A). This analysis further showed that the newly created loop between residues 47 and 56 had near zero probability of forming either an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-strand, suggesting that it is likely flexible as would be expected for a loop of this length connecting two antiparallel \u03b2-strands. This was directly confirmed by an analysis of backbone 15N T2 values. These values provide information about motions on fast (nanosecond-picosecond) and intermediate (microsecond-millisecond) time scales and were significantly elevated in the region corresponding to the newly created loop relative to the other parts of the protein (FIG. 9B), which, except for the N terminus and the short loop connecting \u03b1-helix 1 and \u03b2-strand 1, are expected to be structurally well-ordered.",
                                "To directly examine the three-dimensional structure, mmTGF-\u03b22 was crystallized, and its structure was determined to a resolution of 1.8 \u212b using molecular replacement (Table 3). The overall fold of mmTGF-\u03b22 was shown to be highly similar to that previously determined for TGF-\u03b22, with the exception of the newly created loop, which was shown to take the place of \u03b1-helix 3 as anticipated (FIG. 2B). Superimposition of the mmTGF-\u03b22 with the monomer from the structure of TGF-\u03b22 shows that there is a systematic displacement of up to about 1.5 \u212b of the finger region of mmTGF-\u03b22 relative to TGF-\u03b22. Such differences appear to be the result of bending of the monomer near the center of the finger region and not a change in the structure of the finger region, as superimposition of the fingers alone show that they correspond closely, with a backbone root-mean-square deviation of under 0.2 \u212b and similar orientations of the side chains of several residues that pack and stabilize the fingers (FIG. 2D). Such bending is also supported by an overlay of the two molecules of mmTGF-\u03b22 present in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, which also exhibit a smaller but still noticeable displacement of the finger regions relative to one another (FIG. 2C). Consistent with the NMR analysis, not only was the electron density noticeably weaker in the region corresponding to the newly created loop, but also it was shown to adopt different orientations for the two molecules from the asymmetric unit FIG. 2C).",
                                "The similar folding of mmTGF-\u03b22 relative to TGF-\u03b22, especially in the T\u03b2RII-binding finger region, suggested that it would also bind T\u03b2RII in a similar manner. To evaluate this, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed in which the same concentration series of T\u03b2RII was injected over TGF-\u03b22 and mmTGF-\u03b22 immobilized on separate flow cells (FIGS. 3A and 3B). Although it was not possible to quantitate affinity due to weak binding, the sensorgrams nonetheless showed similar shapes and concentration dependence. These sensorgrams showed that mmTGF-\u03b22 binds T\u03b2RII weakly, consistent with earlier reports Baardsnes et al., Biochemistry 48:2146-2155, 2009), and that it did so in a manner qualitatively similar to TGF-\u03b22.",
                                "The solubility of mmTGF-\u03b22 appeared to be significantly better than that of TGF-\u03b22 and the full-length TGF-\u03b22 monomer, mTGF-\u03b22, as samples of the former could be readily prepared at concentrations of 2-3 mg ml\u22121 without noticeable precipitation at pH 7.0, whereas samples of the latter two proteins were completely precipitated under these same conditions. To quantitate solubility, TGF-\u03b22, mTGF-\u03b22, and mmTGF-\u03b22 were prepared as concentrated stocks in 100 mM acetic acid, pH 2.9, where they were readily soluble and then diluted into PBS, pH 7.4. The light scattering at 340 nM was measured to assess precipitation, and then the samples were centrifuged, and the absorbance at 280 nM was measured to assess the protein concentration. This demonstrated that TGF-\u03b22 and mTGF-\u03b22 were both effectively insoluble at neutral pH over the entire concentration range evaluated (7-100 \u03bcM) (FIGS. 4A and 4B). This is consistent with the known poor solubility of the TGF-\u03b2 homodimers (Pellaud et al., J Biol Chem 274:7699-7704, 1999), but it shows that this property also extends to full-length monomeric TGF-\u03b2s. The mini-monomeric TGF-\u03b22 (mmTGF-\u03b22) in contrast, exhibited modest light scattering and a corresponding modest reduction in the amount of soluble protein relative to that expected when the protein concentration was 40 \u03bcM or higher, indicating that indeed mmTGF-\u03b22 was reasonably soluble at neutral pH, although not perfectly so. This was reflected in NMR spectra, which showed that although 100-200 \u03bcM 15N mmTGF-\u03b22 samples could be readily prepared, the spectrum was nonetheless poor, with the only detectable signals arising from residues in the flexible parts of the protein, namely the N terminus, the exposed loop between \u03b1-helix 1 and \u03b2-strand 1, and the newly created loop between \u03b2-strands 4 and 5. The fact that signals could only be detected from the flexible parts of the protein suggested that mmTGF-\u03b22 forms large soluble aggregates under these conditions. Through trial and error, it was found that these soluble aggregates could be eliminated by addition of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS, with the majority of the NMR signals appearing at the concentration of 5 mM CHAPS and all of the NMR signals appearing at 10 mM CHAPS. Thus, all NMR spectra, including that shown in FIG. 2A, were recorded in the presence of 10 mM CHAPS.",

                                "The results presented above show that whereas mmTGF-\u03b22 is natively folded, it nonetheless possesses low intrinsic affinity for binding T\u03b2RII. To confer mmTGF-\u03b22 with the ability to bind T\u03b2RII with high affinity comparable with that of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23, the three residues in mouse TGF-\u03b22 shown previously to differ in the interface with T\u03b2RII, Lys-25, Ile-92, and Asn-94 (De Crescenzo et al., J Mol Biol 355:47-62, 2006; Hart et al., Nat Struct Biol 9:203-208, 2002), were substituted with the corresponding residues from TGF-\u03b21 and -\u03b23, Arg-25, Val-92, and Arg-94 (FIGS. 1E and 1F). In previous studies, substitution of these three residues was shown to be sufficient to confer TGF-\u03b22 with a T\u03b2RII binding affinity comparable with TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 (Baardsnes et al., Biochemistry 48:2146-2155, 2009; De Crescenzo et al., J Mol Biol 355:47-62, 2006). Despite this, four additional residues peripheral to the T\u03b2RII-binding site that differed in TGF-\u03b22 relative to TGF-\u03b21 were also substituted with the corresponding residues from TGF-\u03b21 (R26K, L89V, T95K, and I98V) (FIGS. 1E and 1F). Although previous results suggested this was not strictly necessary, it was nonetheless done to ensure that the precise orientation of residues in the mmTGF-\u03b22-binding site for T\u03b2RII matched as closely as possible with that in the high affinity TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23. The resulting construct bearing these seven amino acid substitutions, designated mmTGF-\u03b22-7M (FIG. 1E, FIG. 9 and Table 1), was expressed in E. coli in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. As with mmTGF-\u03b22, most of the protein remained in solution after reconstitution and dilution into native folding buffer, and large amounts of homogenous monomer could be isolated (4-5 mg/liter of E. coli culture medium).",
                                "The folding and homogeneity of the isolated mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was evaluated by NMR, and as with mmTGF-\u03b22, the protein was found to have the expected number of signals in a 2D 1H-15N shift correlation spectrum (FIG. 5A) as well as secondary structure, as determined by an analysis of the NMR secondary shifts (FIG. 10A). The solubility of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was evaluated as before, and as shown, its behavior was comparable or perhaps slightly better than that of mmTGF-\u03b22 (FIGS. 4C and 4D). This slight improvement in the macroscopic solubility did not however change the microscopic solubility as NMR analysis showed that it was still necessary to include 10 mM CHAPS in the sample buffer to detect signals from all of the backbone amide resonances in the protein.",
                                "The three-dimensional structure of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was determined by crystallography to a resolution of 2.75 \u212b (Table 3), and as before the overall fold was preserved relative to TGF-\u03b22, with the only difference being a slight hinge bending of the monomer as described for mmTGF-02 (FIGS. 5B and 5C). The increase in the 15N T2 relaxation times in the region corresponding to the newly formed loop in mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was comparable with that in mmTGF-\u03b22 (FIG. 10B). This suggested that the missing density in the region corresponding to the newly formed loop in mmTGF-\u03b22-7M, which among the three molecules in the asymmetric unit was observed for part of chain A and most of chain C, was not due to increased dynamics, but other factors, most likely the lower resolution of the mmTGF-\u03b22-7M structure compared with the mmTGF-\u03b22 structure (Table 3).",
                                "To determine whether mmTGF-\u03b22-7M bound T\u03b2RII with high affinity, variants of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M and TGF-\u03b23 were produced bearing an N-terminal avitag, and after biotinylation and immobilization onto a streptavidin-coated SPR sensor, their binding affinity for T\u03b2RII was measured by performing kinetic SPR experiments (FIGS. 3C and 3D). The sensorgrams obtained differed greatly from that previously obtained for mmTGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b22, in that they exhibited a clear pattern of saturation. The sensorgrams were furthermore shown to have similar shapes as well as fitted parameters, including KD values (Table 2), which were within experimental error of one another and consistent, although on the high end, with KD values reported earlier for T\u03b2RII binding to TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 (Huang et al., EMBO J 30:1263-1276, 2011; Baardsnes et al., Biochemistry 48:2146-2155, 2009; De Crescenzo et al., J Mol Biol 355:47-62, 2006).",
                                "To determine whether the interactions that enabled high affinity T\u03b2RII binding were preserved in mmTGF-\u03b22-7M compared with TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23, the mmTGF-\u03b22-7M\u00b7T\u03b2RII complex was crystallized, and its structure was determined to a resolution of 1.88 \u212b (Table 3). The overall structure of the mmTGF-\u03b22-7M\u00b7T\u03b2RII complex was shown to be very similar to that of one of the T\u03b2RII-bound monomers from the structure of the TGF-\u03b23 T\u03b2RI complex, with T\u03b2RII bound to the mmTGF-\u03b22-7M fingertips in a manner that is essentially indistinguishable from that of TGF-\u03b23 (FIG. 5D). The interactions known to contribute most significantly to high affinity binding are furthermore shown to be fully preserved in the mmTGF-\u03b2-7M\u00b7T\u03b2RII complex relative to TGF-\u03b21.113RII and TGF-\u03b23. T\u03b2RII complexes that have been previously determined (the TGF-\u03b23T\u03b2RII complex determined to 1.8 \u212b (Hart et al., Nat Struct Biol 9:203-208, 2002) is shown as this is the highest resolution structure determined to date) (FIG. 5E). This includes the packing of Ile-53 from T\u03b2RII in the hydrophobic pocket between the TGF-\u03b2 fingers, and the hydrogen-bonded ion pairs formed between TGF-\u03b2 Arg-25 and Arg-94 on the tips of the loops connecting fingers \u00bd and \u00be, respectively, and the carboxylate groups of Glu-119 and Asp-32 on T\u03b2RII (FIG. 5E).",
                                "Inhibitory Activity of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M and the Underlying Mechanism",
                                "The results presented above show that mmTGF-\u03b22-7M possesses one of the essential attributes required to function as a dominant negative inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is the ability to bind T\u03b2RII with high affinity comparable with that of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23. To directly assess whether mmTGF-\u03b22-7M might signal and, if not, whether it might function as an inhibitor, TGF-\u03b2 signaling was assessed by treating HEK293 cells stably transfected with a TGF-luciferase reporter under the control of a CAGA12 promoter (Thies et al., Growth Factors 18:251-259, 2001) with increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2s. The results showed that dimeric TGF-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and full-length monomeric TGF-\u03b23 (mTGF-\u03b23) resulted in a sigmoidal increase in the luciferase response, with concentrations of roughly 25 pM TGF-\u03b21 and 250 pM mTGF-\u03b23 leading to no further increase in the measured luciferase response. This is consistent with earlier reports that showed that (full-length) monomeric TGF-\u03b21 and -\u03b23 were 5-15-fold less potent than their dimeric counterparts (Ztilliga et al., J Mol Biol 354, 1052-1068, 2005; Amatayakul-Chantler et al., J Biol Chem 269:27687-27691, 1994). The normalized luciferase responses could be readily fitted to a standard model for ligand-dependent activation and yielded EC50 values of 12.4\u00b11.5 pM for TGF-\u03b21 and 182\u00b116 pM for mTGF-\u03b23. The values for TGF-\u03b21 and mTGF-\u03b23 were in close accord with the values previously reported by Amatayakul-Chantler et al. (J Biol Chem 269:27687-27691, 1994) for TGF-\u03b21 and by Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al. (J Mol Biol 354, 1052-1068, 2005) for mTGF-\u03b23. The potent sub-nanomolar signaling activity observed for TGF-\u03b21 and mTGF-\u03b23 stands in contrast to that of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M, which had no detectable signaling activity at the concentration that led to a saturating response for mTGF-\u03b23 (ca. 200 pM) or at concentrations that were up to four orders of magnitude higher (FIG. 6A). Thus, mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was either completely devoid of signaling activity or it possessed signaling activity, but with a potency more than a 10,000-fold less than that of mTGF-\u03b23.",
                                "To further investigate the properties of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M, a competition experiment was performed in which the same HEK293 luciferase reporter cell line was stimulated with a constant sub-EC50 concentration of dimeric TGF-\u03b21 (8.0 pM) and increasing concentrations of mTGF-\u03b23 or mmTGF-\u03b22-7M. The results showed that mTGF-\u03b23 further stimulated signaling with a midpoint concentration similar to that of mTGF-\u03b23 alone (FIG. 6B). The fitted EC50 values confirm this, with an EC50 of 182\u00b116 pM for the data shown in FIG. 6A and EC50 of 194\u00b136 pM for the data shown in FIG. 6B. The behavior of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was very different, with no detectable change in the signaling activity when added up to concentrations of 10 nM, but with a sharp decrease to no detectable signaling activity when the concentration was increased to 100 nM (FIG. 6B). This shows that mmTGF-\u03b22-7M indeed possesses no signaling activity and that it can function to completely block and inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling. The normalized luciferase responses could be readily fitted to a standard model for ligand-dependent inhibition and yielded an IC50 value of 68\u00b17 nM. Similar experiments showed that mmTGF-\u03b22-7M also functioned as a potent competitive inhibitor against the other TGF-\u03b2 isoforms, TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23, with measured IC50 values (TGF-\u03b22 IC50 19\u00b13 nM and TGF-\u03b23 IC50 21\u00b18 nM) within a factor of 2-3 of that measured for TGF-\u03b21 (FIGS. 15A and 15B). These IC50 values are on the lower end of the range of affinities that have been reported for binding of the high affinity TGF-\u03b2 isoforms to T\u03b2RII, including mmTGF-\u03b22-7M reported herein (Table 2). This suggests that mmTGF-\u03b22-7M functions to inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling by binding to and blocking endogenous T\u03b2RII. The fact that the measured potency is greater than the greatest affinity previously reported for TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b23 binding to T\u03b2RII (140 nM) (9), suggests that other factors, such as nonspecific association of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M with the plasma membrane, may serve to potentiate its inhibitory activity.",
                                "The finding that mmTGF-\u03b22-7M possesses no apparent signaling activity, and functions as a low nanomolar inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, suggests that the elimination of \u03b1-helix 3 diminished non-covalent association of the monomers and greatly attenuated or abrogated T\u03b2RI binding. To assess this directly, SPR experiments were performed to determine whether mmTGF-\u03b22-7M could recruit T\u03b2RI in the presence of T\u03b2RII. To accomplish this, increasing concentrations of T\u03b2RI and the same concentration series of T\u03b2RI in the presence of near-saturating amounts of T\u03b2RII (2 \u03bcM) were injected over the same TGF-\u03b23 and mmTGF-\u03b22-7M SPR chip surfaces used for the T\u03b2RII binding measurements described above. This showed that T\u03b2RI alone binding is negligible to both TGF-\u03b23 and mmTGF-\u03b22-7M (FIGS. 3E and 3F), but unlike TGF-\u03b23, T\u03b2RII-bound mmTGF-\u03b22-7M is unable to recruit T\u03b2RI (FIGS. 3G and 3H). This is consistent with the earlier result reported by Huang et al. (EMBO J 30:1263-1276, 2011) that T\u03b2RII-bound mTGF-\u03b23 was significantly or completely impaired in terms of its ability to bind and recruit T\u03b2RI. This also provides further evidence that T\u03b2RII-bound TGF-\u03b2 monomers are incapable of binding and recruiting T\u03b2RI, but because the mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was immobilized on the surface of the sensor, it alone does not provide any insight as to whether mmTGF-\u03b22-7M might be capable of non-covalently dimerizing and binding and recruiting T\u03b2RI.",
                                "To address these questions directly, two solution-based techniques were used, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). The AUC experiments were performed by measuring the total UV absorbance at 280 nm as a function of the radial position and time as mTGF-\u03b23, mmTGF-\u03b22, and mmTGF-\u03b22-7M were sedimented under acidic conditions, pH 3.8, where the monomers are fully soluble. The AUC data revealed parabolically shaped van Holde-Weischet sedimentation coefficient distribution plots for all three monomers, consistent with each undergoing reversible self-association to form a dimer or other higher order oligomer. To determine more precisely which species might be present in solution, the data were fitted to the simplest model possible, a discrete monomer-dimer equilibrium, using finite element analysis. The fitting procedure resulted in near-perfect fits for all three monomers to the simple monomer-dimer model, as shown by (a) the close overlays between the fitted curves (red) with the raw data, after the time and radially-invariant noise was removed (black) and (b) the absence of any systemic deviations in the residuals (FIGS. 11-13). The fitted parameters further showed that KD for self-association was 1 order of magnitude greater for mTGF-\u03b23 compared with mmTGF-\u03b22 and mmTGF-\u03b22-7M. Thus, the removal of the heel helix, a3, does diminish self-association of the monomers to form dimers, but it does not completely abrogate dimer formation.",
                                "TR-FRET was used to assess the ability of dimeric and monomeric TGF-\u03b2s to bind and bring T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII together. This was accomplished by generating differentially tagged forms of T\u03b2RII and T\u03b2RI and in turn binding to these tags with proteins labeled with fluorescent donors and acceptors. T\u03b2RII was tagged with a C-terminal His tag and was bound by a terbium cryptate-labeled anti-His monoclonal antibody fluorescent donor, and T\u03b2RI was tagged with an N-terminal avitag, which after enzymatic biotinylation was bound to a dye-labeled (XL-665) streptavidin fluorescent acceptor (FIG. 7A). The addition of TGF-\u03b2 to the tagged receptors brings them together and leads to a large increase in the \u0394F value, which is defined as the ratio of the acceptor and donor emission fluorescent intensities. The TR-FRET assay is demonstrated by the data presented in FIG. 14 and was used here to compare the ability of the TGF-\u03b23 full-length monomer, mTGF-\u03b23, and the TGF-\u03b22 mini-monomer that binds T\u03b2RII with high affinity, mmTGF-\u03b22-7M, to bind and bring T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII together. The TR-FRET signal for mTGF-\u03b23 was shown to be comparable with that of TGF-\u03b23, and this did not depend on whether the TGF-\u03b2 concentration was 100 or 250 nM (FIG. 7B). The TR-FRET signal of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was, in contrast, within the error limits of the buffer control, and this did not depend on the TGF-\u03b2 concentration (FIG. 7B). These results demonstrate that under these conditions, mTGF-\u03b23 retains full capacity to assemble a non-covalent dimeric complex with T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, but under these same conditions, mmTGF-\u03b22-7M has no capacity to do so. These results, together with the AUC results, indicate that the removal of the heel helix had the effects hypothesized; its removal reduced, but did not eliminate, dimer formation, and even though dimers are still formed, they are unable to bind and recruit T\u03b2RI."

                                "The TGF-\u03b2s are responsible for promoting the progression of numerous human diseases (Dietz et al., Nature 352:337-339, 1991; Biernacka et al., Growth Factors 29:196-202, 2011; Massague, Cell 134:215-230, 2008; Loeys et al., Pediatr Endocrinol Rev 10:417-423, 2013), yet despite nearly two decades of preclinical studies and clinical trials, no inhibitors have been approved for use in humans. The results presented herein demonstrate that an engineered TGF-\u03b2 monomer, lacking Cys-77 and the heel \u03b1-helix (a3), functions to potently block and inhibit signaling of the TGF-\u03b21, -\u03b22, and -\u03b23 with IC50 values in the range of 20-70 nM (FIG. 6B and FIG. 15). This novel inhibitor has several attributes that overcome limitations that have been encountered with other classes of inhibitors, for example the natural high specificity of TGF-\u03b2 and thus the inhibitor for T\u03b2RII may engender it with much greater specificity, and thus fewer undesirable side effects, compared with the much more promiscuous TGF-\u03b2 kinase inhibitors. The small size of the inhibitor (\u02dc10 kDa) further confers a much greater ability to penetrate tumors and other dense tissues where the TGF-\u03b2s drive disease progression, a distinct advantage compared with IgG antibodies, which are much larger (\u02dc150 kDa) and tend to occupy only the vascular and interstitial space of well perfused organs (Meibohm (2012) in Therapeutic Proteins: Strategies to Modulate Their Plasma Half-Lives (Kontermann R., editor), pages 23-38, Wiley-Blackwell, Weinheim, Germany; Meibohm and Braeckman (2008), \u201cPharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Peptides and Protein Drugs,\u201d in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology: Fundamentals and Applications (Crommelin D. J. A., Sindelar R. D., and Meibohm B., eds), pages 95-123, Informa Healthcare, New York). The other advantages of this novel inhibitor include its high intrinsic stability, because of the four intramolecular disulfide bonds that tie the four fingers together, and the fact that it is highly soluble in water at neutral pH, unlike native TGF-\u03b2 dimers or full-length TGF-\u03b2 monomers.",
                                "The structures of TGF-\u03b2 receptor complexes, together with the previously published chemical cross-linking data, suggested that the potent signaling activity of TGF-\u03b21 C77S and TGF-\u03b23 C77S was due to the ability of the monomers to non-covalently dimerize and in turn assemble a (T\u03b2RI T\u03b2RII)2 heterotetramer. The results presented here, namely the AUC experiments that were used to assess non-covalent dimer formation and the TR-FRET experiments that were used to assess assembly of complexes with T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII, provided further evidence for this. The AUC data showed that full-length monomeric TGF-\u03b23, mTGF-\u03b23, self-associates to form dimers with a dimerization constant of 4.1 \u03bcM (Table 4). The TR-FRET data showed that at a concentration of 0.1 or 0.25 \u03bcM and in the presence of comparable concentrations of the T\u03b2RI and T\u03b2RII ectodomains, mTGF-\u03b23 assembles T\u03b2RIT\u03b2RII complexes to the same extent as dimeric TGF-\u03b23 (FIG. 7B). That this occurs, even under conditions where the mTGF-\u03b23 concentrations (0.1-0.25 \u03bcM, FIG. 7B) were more than an order of magnitude below the KD value for self-association (4.1 \u03bcM, Table 4), indicates that receptor binding also contributes significantly to assembly of T\u03b2RI\u00b7T\u03b2RII complexes. The assembly of T\u03b2RI\u00b7T\u03b2RII complexes with mTGF-\u03b23, and presumably mTGF-\u03b21 as well, therefore appears to be a cooperative process, much like protein folding, in which multiple weaker interactions, including monomer-monomer, non-covalent dimer-receptor, and receptor-receptor interactions, cooperate to enable formation of a thermodynamically stable TGF-\u03b2. T\u03b2RI T\u03b2RII complex. This manner of cooperative assembly is likely responsible for the ability of mTGF-\u03b21 and mTGF-\u03b23 to induce signaling at concentrations that are more than 4 orders of magnitude below the KD value for self-association of the monomers (EC50 values of about 0.1 nM versus KD values for self-association of 4.1 \u03bcM).",
                                "The elimination of the heel helix from the TGF-\u03b2 monomer was shown to be very effective in terms of blocking the cooperative assembly of T\u03b2RI T\u03b2RII complexes as shown by the TR-FRET data (FIG. 7B) and the cell based signaling data (FIGS. 6A and 6B). The AUC data showed that elimination of the heel helix led to the weakening of the monomer-monomer interaction by one order of magnitude (Table 4). The SPR data shown in FIGS. 3G and 3H, further showed that the T\u03b2RII-bound form of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M was incapable of binding and recruiting T\u03b2RI, which is expected based on published structures of TGF-\u03b2 receptor complexes that show that T\u03b2RI binds to a composite interface formed by both chains of TGF-\u03b2, as well as T\u03b2RII (Groppe et al., Mol Cell 29, 157-168, 2008; Radaev et al., J Biol Chem 285:14806-14814, 2010). Thus, the data show that the reduced propensity of the engineered monomer to self-associate, together with what would be expected to be very weak binding of T\u03b2RI to any dimers that do form, is responsible for the inability of mmTGF-\u03b22-7M to assemble a T\u03b2RI T\u03b2RII complex. This accounts for the lack of signaling activity, and this together with the retention of high affinity T\u03b2RII binding accounts for the inhibitory activity.",
                                "The other type II receptors of the family, activin type II receptor II, activin type IIB receptor, BMP type II receptor, and anti-Mtillerian hormone type II receptor, have either been shown or are predicted to bind the GF knuckle and not the GF fingertips, as does T\u03b2RII (Hinck et al., Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 8:a022103, 2016). Nonetheless, they share the same property as T\u03b2RII in that they bind only by contacting residues from a single GF monomer and not both monomers as has been shown or is predicted for all type I receptors of the family (Hinck et al., Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 8:a022103, 2016). This, together with the structures reported here that show that it is possible to remove \u03b13 without affecting the overall structure of the monomer (FIGS. 2B-2D and FIGS. 5B-5E), suggests that it might be possible to generate monomers of other GFs of the family lacking the heel helix that function as inhibitors. These types of inhibitors have numerous potential applications, ranging from research tools for probing roles of specific ligands in vivo to clinically useful inhibitors for treating disease, which are driven by hyperactive signaling by other ligands of the family, such as cancer cachexia by activin (Coerver et al., Mol Endocrinol 10:534-543, 1996).",
