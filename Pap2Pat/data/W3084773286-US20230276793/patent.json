                                "Sanitation is an important component of good agricultural practices for preventing cross-contamination of fresh produce during production. Many of the foodborne diseases resulting from minimally processed products can be traced back to cross-contamination of food products from food contact surfaces. Any surface that comes into contact with food, either directly or indirectly, is a food contact surface and must be cleaned and sanitized to prevent cross-contamination and biofilm formation. Bacteria biofilm formation in food processing facilities is recognized as one of the major food safety concerns. Biofilms can adhere to different types of food contact surfaces, including stainless-steel, plastic, glass, and wood, causing bacterial foodborne disease outbreaks, lowering shelf life of the food products, and causing numerous economic losses (see Winkelstr\u00f6ter, L. K., dos Reis Teixeira, F. B., Silva, E. P., Alves, V. F. & De Martinis, E. C. P. Unraveling microbial biofilms of importance for food microbiology.

C. et al. Targeted disruption of the extracellular polymeric network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms by alginate oligosaccharides. npj Biofilms and Microbiomes 4(1), 1-10 (2018)).",
                                "Important potential sources of bacterial contamination also include fisheries and aquaculture, which are growing industries. Vibrio spp. are natural inhabitants of estuaries and coastal marine environments. Another important aquatic microorganism is Aeromonas hydrophila, which can cause disease in fish and humans. This microorganism is a major problem for the aquaculture industry, affecting seafood quality and causing severe losses for production and marketing (see Vivekanandhan, G., Hatha, A. A. M., & Lakshmanaperumalsamy, P. (2005). Prevalence of Aeromonas hydrophila in fish and prawns from the seafood market of Coimbatore, South India. Food Microbiology, 22(1), 133-137).",
                                "Since most fresh produce is consumed raw, there is a potential for cross-contamination and transfer of pathogenic bacteria from aquaculture water to edible parts of plants (see Ovissipour, M., Rasco, B., Bledsoe, G., & Shiroodi, S. (2019). A Guide to the Aquaponics Food Safety Plan Development: Green Aquaponics LLC as a Model. Virginia Cooperative Extension, FST-302P/VSG-18-P). Controlling fish diseases and foodborne pathogens in recirculating aquaculture systems and aquaponics using antibiotics, chemical sanitizers, and pesticides is challenging due to the sensitivity of the microbial community in biofilters (which oxidize ammonia to non-toxic nitrate), chemical residue concerns in both fish and plants, and regulatory stand points.",
                                "Bacterial biofilms are associated with a self-produced slimy matrix, which includes up to 90% of the biofilm biomass, composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) containing polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), which adhere to each other and form a biofilm (see Zhao, X., Zhao, F., Wang, J. & Zhong, N. Biofilm formation and control strategies of foodborne pathogens: food safety perspectives. RSC Advances 7(58), 36670-36683, 2017). Compared to planktonic cells, biofilms are more resistant to environmental stresses and disinfectants; therefore, decontamination of biofilms in food processing facilities is an important food safety challenge (see Kim, H., Ryu, J. H. & Beuchat, L. R. Attachment of and biofilm formation by Enterobacter sakazakii on stainless steel and enteral feeding tubes. Appl. Environ. Micro. 72(9), 5846-5856 (2006); Bae, Y. M., Baek, S. Y., & Lee, S. Y. (2012). Resistance of pathogenic bacteria on the surface of stainless steel depending on attachment form and efficacy of chemical sanitizers. Int. J. Food Micro. 153(3), 465-473, (2012)).",
                                "Antimicrobial activity of commonly used sanitizers including chlorine, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium (QUATS), sodium hypochlorite, and peracetic acid, which have strong antimicrobial properties against planktonic microorganisms, can be limited against surface attached microbes due to rapid depletion in concentration and activity upon reactions with organic matter, complexity of structural features of the plant surfaces, and factors related to EPS in biofilms (see Hughes, G. & Webber, M. A. Novel Approaches to the Treatment of Bacterial Biofilm Infections. Br. J. Pharmacol. 174, 2237-2246, (2017)). In addition, current agricultural practices and sanitation using chlorine, peracetic acid, and ozone can only reduce 1-2 log of the bacteria on the surface of food materials, including fresh produce and fruits, due to the non-specific reactivity of sanitizers with plant organic content and the complexity of surface physicochemical properties which may protect bacteria from contact with conventional sanitizers, thereby limiting the efficacy of conventional sanitizers.",
                                "Both acidic and neutral electrolyzed water (AEW and NEW) have been successfully applied in food and the seafood industries as a novel and environmentally friendly technology. Antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of EW have been studied by prior researchers who successfully applied acidic EW for removing L. monocytogenes, E coli, and V. parahaemolyticus biofilms (see Han, 2017; Shiroodi, S. G., Ovissipour, R., Ross, C. F. & Rasco, B. A. Efficacy of electrolyzed oxidizing water as a pretreatment method for reducing Listeria monocytogenes contamination in cold-smoked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Food Control 60, 401-407 (2016); Ovissipour, R. et al.

                                "Compared to acidic electrolyzed water (AEW), NEW typically has less side effects on food quality due to its slightly acidic to neutral pH (5-6.5). Due to the available form of chlorine (hypochlorous acid) in NEW, it also has greater antimicrobial properties (see Cui, X., Shang, Y., Shi, Z., Xin, H., & Cao, W. Physicochemical properties and bactericidal efficiency of neutral and acidic electrolyzed water under different storage conditions. J. Food Eng. 91(4), 582-586 (2009)).",
                                "Recently, nanobubbles (NB) (also known as ultrafine bubbles) have gained researchers' attention due to their unique properties in wide fields of advanced science and technology including engineering, medical, agricultural, and food sectors (see Shen, Y., Longo, M. L. & Powell, R. L. Stability and rheological behavior of concentrated monodisperse food emulsifier coated microbubble suspensions. J. Coll. Interf Sci. 327(1), 204-210 (2008); Zhu, Z., Sun, D. W., Zhang, Z., Li, Y. & Cheng, L. Effects of micro-nano bubbles on the nucleation and crystal growth of sucrose and maltodextrin solutions during ultrasound-assisted freezing process. LWT 92, 404-411 (2018); and Phan, K. K., Truong, T., Wang, Y. & Bhandari. B. Nanobubbles: Fundamental characteristics and applications in food processing. Trend. Food Sci. Tech. 95, 118-130 (2019)). In particular, antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties of nanobubbles have been shown by a few studies on Burkholderia multivorans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using NB generated by laser and gold nanoparticles (See Teirlinck, E. et al. Laser-induced vapour nanobubbles improve drug diffusion and efficiency in bacterial biofilms. Nature Communications 9(1), 4518 (2018); and Teirlinck, E. et al. Laser-induced vapor nanobubbles improve diffusion in biofilms of antimicrobial agents for wound care. Biofilm 1, 100004 (2019)). Additionally, researchers have studied the viable bacterial count on Chinese cabbage using ultrafine bubbles in combination with EW (see Ushida et al., 2017), Bovine serum albumin using nanobubbles (see Zhu et al., 2016), periodonto-pathogenic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using ozone NB (see Hayakumo et al., 2014), P. aeruginosa biofilm and carbohydrate, protein and fat on SS using microbubbles (see Burfoot, D., Limburn, R. & Busby, R. Assessing the effects of incorporating bubbles into the water used for cleaning operations relevant to the food industry. Int. J. Food Sci. Tech. 52(8), 1894-1903 (2017)).",
                                "NB exist in both bulk and interface, and due to their unique properties, including nano-size diameter, negative surface charge, and Brownian motion, they develop a stable form of bubbles resulting in supersaturated solutions (see Zhu, J. et al. Cleaning with bulk nanobubbles. Langmuir 32(43), 11203-11211 (2016); Ushikubo, F. Y. et al. Evidence of the existence and the stability of nano-bubbles in water. Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 361(1-3):31-37 (2010)).",
                                "Antibiofilm and antimicrobial properties of NB are strongly correlated to the physical properties of the NB (including high gas transfer capacity), generation of free radicals including (OH\u00b7), high energy release by bursting and collapsing of bubbles, and the potential generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (see Ushikubo et al., 2010; Ghadimkhani et al., 2016; Liu, S., Oshita, S. & Makino, Y. Stimulating effect of nanobubbles on the reactive oxygen species generation inside barley seeds as studied by the microscope spectrophotometer. In Proceedings. Int. Conf. of Agric. Eng., Zurich (pp. 06-10) (2014); Demangeat, J. L. Gas nanobubbles and aqueous nanostructures: the crucial role of dynamization. Homeopathy 104(02), 101-115 (2015).)",
                                "Hydroxyl radicals possess a significantly higher reactivity with organic materials in water, indicating high potential for removing organic materials (see Phan et al., 2019), which can be used for removing biofilm EPS. EPS makes up about 80% of the biofilm dry mass mainly containing carbohydrates and proteins (see Liu, Y., Li, J., Qiu, X. & Burda, C. Bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped metal oxide nanocatalysts and the influence of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). J. Photochem. Photobio. A: Chemistry 190(1), 94-100 (2007)). EPS is responsible for biofilm properties including density, porosity and hydrophobicity. During the sanitation operation, an effective sanitizer should break up or dissolve biofilm EPS so that the disinfectant can access the viable cells (see Shen, Y. Response of simulated drinking water biofilm mechanical and structural properties to long-term disinfectant exposure. Environ. Sci. Tech. 50(4), 1779-1787 (2016)). Biofilm removal from surfaces depends strongly on EPS degradation rather than removal of intracellular compounds (see Han, Q. et al. Removal of foodborne pathogen biofilms by acidic electrolyzed water. Front Micro. 8, e988 (2017)). Zhou et al. (2016) showed that the presence of ozone reduced EPS content of microbial biofilms. Han et al. (2017) also reported that acidic EW disrupted microbial biofilms EPS.",
                                "Cleaning and preventing contamination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces using NB have been shown by bovine serum albumin (BSA) indicating the strong surfactant properties of NB (see Zhu et al., 2016), and organic material (Humic acid) on ceramic (see Ghadimkhani et al., 2016). The incorporation of NB into membrane filtration is an emerging technology for decreasing and preventing membrane or surface fouling because of the high mass transfer ability of NB (see Zhu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2008).",
                                "Preventing organic materials adhesion to surfaces by NB has been shown in prior studies (see Zhu et al., 2016). Several studies have suggested that the cell surface hydrophobicity may have an important role in bacterial adhesion to surfaces (see Huang et al., 2017; Gibbons, R. J. & Etherden, I. Comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles. Infec. Immun. 41(3), 1190-1196 (1983)). It has also been shown that L. innocua cells have a negative surface charge (see Gibbons et al., 1983). Moreover, the zeta potential results showed that NB in solutions are normally negatively charged at the gas-water interface, resulting in surface tension and contact angle reduction, and act as surfactants (see Zhu et al., 2018).",
                                "Further, it has been shown by prior studies that treating medical grade poly vinyl chloride with oxygen resulted in a 70% reduction in bacterial adhesion for four strains of P. aeruginosa (see Balazs, D. J. et al. Surface modification of PVC endotracheal tubes by oxygen glow discharge to reduce bacterial adhesion. Surf Inter. Anal. 35(3), 301-309 (2003)), but this reduction by surface oxygenation was not sufficient to prevent colonization of bacteria (see Triandafillu, K. et al. Adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to untreated and oxygen-plasma treated poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) from endotracheal intubation devices. Biomaterials April 24(8), 1507-1518 (2003)). On both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, bovine serum albumin adhesion was reduced significantly by NB, which might be due to the protein adsorbing to the NB in bulk due to the negative charge of NB (see Zhu et al., 2018). Antifouling and cleaning properties of NB have been suggested by prior researches on membrane filters and ceramic (see Ghadimkhani et al., 2016).",

                                "However, antibiofilm and antimicrobial properties of NB alone and in combination with other environmentally friendly sanitizers have not been studied extensively, and only a few studies have investigated antimicrobial properties of nanobubbles alone or in combination with chemicals and other non-thermal processing such as ultrasound (see Kozima et al., 2006; Ushida et al., 2017; Shiroodi, S., Schwarz, M., Nitin, N., & Ovissipour, R.

Ultrasound alone and in combination with UV-C was applied for inactivating heterotrophic bacteria in intensive aquaculture system which did not result in a significant reduction (Lakeh, A. A.

Due to the high internal pressure in nanobubbles, when they burst on the surface of bacteria because of the ultrasound, they release high surface energy, allowing conversion of 02 to ROS and cause surface cavitation resulting in bacterial inactivation (Phan et al., 2019). Furthermore, hydroxyl radicals can be generated in the water as a result of nanobubbles collapse (Demangeat, 2015). Hydroxyl radical generation and shock waves from collapse of small cavities are other possible mechanisms for antimicrobial properties of nanobubbles (Teirlinck et al., 2018, 2019).",

                        "Novel approaches to remove and inactivate diverse microbial biofilms are disclosed herein. To address challenges in sanitation, the inventors have developed three novel approaches. The first includes using nanobubbles technology alone or in combination with low concentrations of commonly used sanitizers for biofilm and bacteria removal and inactivation in water, in solutions (cell-suspensions), and on food surfaces. The second approach is the preparation of engineered nanobubbles by surface modification to deliver antimicrobial compounds to bacteria. The present inventors hypothesize (although not wishing to be bound by any particular theory) that the scientific foundation of this approach is that the bubbles attack and disrupt microbial biofilms, induce oxidative stress, and reduce surface tension, which enhance biofilm removal from surfaces, while the nanobubbles deliver antimicrobial compounds to bacteria. The third approach involves inactivation of bacteria in a combination treatment with nanobubbles and ultrasound.",
                        "In embodiments, the present invention provides a rapid method for bacterial reduction and inactivation in cell-suspensions and liquids, biofilms, and/or on surfaces. The technology is based on the use of nanobubbles comprising one or more gases, chemical sanitizers, surfactants, and/or antimicrobial compounds used alone and/or in combination with other processing technologies. The nanobubbles have negative surface charges which can reduce surface tension, release reactive oxygen species, and facilitate surface modification to carry antimicrobial compounds. Nanobubbles generated with different gases such as air, oxygen, CO2, nitrogen, chlorine dioxide, Octafluoropropane and/or sulfur hexafluoride can be used alone or in combination with one or more sanitizers such as chlorine, peracetic acid, QUATS (quaternary ammonium compounds), hydrogen peroxide, electrolyzed water (EW), which can include neutral, acidic, and/or basic electrolyzed water, imidazole, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and/or surfactants to inactivate bacteria in suspensions, liquids, biofilms, and/or on surfaces. Nanobubble surfaces also can also be modified and engineered through self-assembly by applying antimicrobial compounds including polymers, phages, peptides, carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, alcohols, and ketones.",
                        "Applications of this technology include uses in many food production systems where pesticides, chemicals, and antibiotics are not allowed or are not ideal. There is also a market for this technology in medical and dental hygiene. In some embodiments of the invention, since there are no chemicals, this technology could be used for medical device sanitation, wound cleaning, and dental hygiene. Due to their small sizes, nanobubbles can penetrate into cavities, and after applying ultrasonication, can kill bacteria in areas which are not accessible by other sanitizers. In the field of environmental science, the technology can assist with removing oil, off-flavor, and algae from water. In the chemical sanitizers industry, sanitizers with higher efficacy and less chemicals are always of interest. Finally, this technology may be useful to the marine industry, as nanobubbles have antifouling properties which can reduce the attachment of organisms to the facilities in marine environment.",
                        "Further uses include use in the food and agriculture industries, such as for harvest equipment sanitation, processing equipment sanitation, sanitation of contact and non-contact food surfaces, water treatment, agricultural water treatment and sanitation prior using for plants, fresh produce sanitation, fruits sanitation, and seafood and meat sanitation. In addition, the invention can be used for removing debris and/or biofilms inside the pipes in food facilities, aquaculture farms, Aquaponics, hydroponics, and in the organic foods industry.",
                        "Nanobubbles-ultrasound combinations could also be of significant interest especially to the fresh produce, aquaculture, algae mass production systems in hydroponics, and aquaponics industries as alternative approaches to treat recycling water.",

                                "The results illustrate that exposure time and mechanical force had a significant role in reducing the bacterial biofilms from plastic and SS coupons. Similar results were reported by prior studies on bacterial detachment from different surfaces. Huang et al. (2018) showed that exposure time and mechanical force (shear force) had a significant role in bacterial reduction from fresh produce surfaces. They reported that the bacterial reduction was significantly enhanced by increasing the shear force from 0 to 200 rpm (see Huang, K., Tian, Y., Salvi, D., Karwe, M. & Nitin, N. Influence of exposure time, shear stress, and surfactants on detachment of Escherichia coli 0157: H7 from fresh lettuce leaf surfaces during washing process. Food Biopro. Tech. 11(3), 621-633 (2018)). Ushida et al. (2017) found that mechanical forces including fluid flow, shear and friction, have a significant role in enhancing the bacterial detachment by NB. Similar to our findings, other researchers also reported the importance of applying mechanical force and exposure time for removing bacteria, biofilm and organic loads using NB (see Hayakumo et al., 2014; Ushida et al., 2017; Burfoot, D., Limburn, R. & Busby, R. Assessing the effects of incorporating bubbles into the water used for cleaning operations relevant to the food industry. Int. J. Food Sci. Tech. 52(8), 1894-1903 (2017)).",
                                "The results also show that the antibiofilm properties of EW and NB alone, were enhanced after mixing the solutions as EWNB treatment which agreed with other researchers' findings (see Ushida et al., 2017). It has been pointed out that combining NB with chemicals including chlorine or electrolyzed water at sub-lethal levels, would increase the antimicrobial efficacy of the combinations (see Burfoot et al., 2017). The bactericidal properties of nanobubbles are similar to those of ozonated water, which is an oxidizing agent. Thus, free radical-mediated oxidation reactions play an important role in removing the biofilms by NB (see Hayakumo et al., 2014). NB in the water can reduce the surface tension due to the cluster cleavage of the hydrogen bonds among water molecules and ionization of any chemicals in the water, and also due to the excess of hydroxyl ions (OH\u2212) at the gas-water interface resulting in negative zeta potential in NB (see Phan et al., 2019). The results of the contact angle of the plastics and SS treated with NB showed that NB reduced the contact angle from 79\u00b0 in untreated plastic to 76.8\u00b0 in NB-treated plastic, and from 70.1 in untreated SS to 67.3 in NB treated SS, illustrating that the decrease in surface contact angles, improves the removal of bacteria which agrees with other researchers' findings (see Huang, K. & Nitin, N. Enhanced removal of Escherichia coli 0157: H7 and Listeria innocua from fresh lettuce leaves using surfactants during simulated washing. Food Control 79, 207-217 (2017)). The results of this study suggest that NB can be used as a surfactant for reducing surface tension, and enhancing the bacterial removal from surfaces.",

Dissolved oxygen of NB water was measured with a DO meter (YSI-Pro2030; YSI Incorporated, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA). To analyze the effect of shear stress on the removal of bacterial biofilms from plastic and SS surfaces, samples including control groups were exposed to 200 rpm shear force according to Huang et al. (2018), to create turbulent flow. The pH of final solutions was between 6.5 to 7.",

Sodium thiosulphate solution also was added to the control groups (PBS and saline solution). For enumeration of bacterial population, the plastic cover slips and SS coupons were placed into 50-mL falcon tubes containing 10 ml sterile maximum recovery diluent (MRD; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), vortexed vigorously for 1 min. and sonicated for 2 min. in an ultrasound bath (Branson CPX2800, Fisher brand) at room temperature.

Raman spectra were collected using a DXR2 microscopy Raman spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, Mass.) equipped with a 785 nm diode laser source.
