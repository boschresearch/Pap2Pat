    "title": "The IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway regulates beta cell homeostasis",
    "date": "2022-02-03",
    "abstract": "Loss of pancreatic beta cells is a central feature of type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, but a therapeutic strategy to preserve beta cell mass remains to be established. Here we show that the death receptor TMEM219 is expressed on pancreatic beta cells and that signaling through its ligand insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) leads to beta cell loss and dysfunction. Increased peripheral IGFBP3 was observed in established and at-risk T1D/T2D patients and was confirmed in T1D/T2D preclinical models, suggesting that dysfunctional IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling is associated with abnormalities in beta cells homeostasis. In vitro and in vivo short-term IGFBP3/TMEM219 inhibition and TMEM219 genetic ablation preserved beta cells and prevented/delayed diabetes onset, while long-term IGFBP3/TMEM219 blockade allowed for beta cell expansion. Interestingly, in several patients' cohorts restoration of appropriate IGFBP3 levels was associated with improved beta cell function. The IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway is thus shown to be a physiological regulator of beta cell homeostasis and is also demonstrated to be disrupted in T1D/T2D. IGFBP3/TMEM219 targeting may therefore serve as a therapeutic option in diabetes.",

                "Pancreatic beta-cell mass and homeostasis are primarily preserved and maintained through a finely tuned balance of life and death1,2. Several stress factors (e.g., glucolipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune attack/infiltration) that impair beta-cell function3,4, as well as growth factors and circulating hormones that allow for beta-cell proliferation and renewal5\u20139, have been extensively studied, but little is known with respect to the way(s) by which beta-cell loss can be prevented. Current therapeutics employed in diabetes are now being tested for their potential effects in preserving beta-cell survival, given that maintaining endogenous insulin secretion\u2014even to a minor degree\u2014may improve clinical outcomes in diabetic patients10,11. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests a substantial beneficial effect in specifically targeting beta-cell death as a key mechanism to preserve the beta-cell pool and prevent or delay diabetes onset12\u201315. TMEM219 is a recently discovered death receptor, which induces cell apoptosis by a Caspase-8-dependent mechanism, through the binding with its ligand, the Insulin-like growth factors binding protein 3 (IGFBP3)16,17. Indeed, IGFBP3 acts as a carrier of nearly 95% of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and IGF-II in the circulation18, but it also has an IGF-I independent effect on TMEM219-expressing intestinal stem cells19,20. The crucial role of the IGFBP3 signaling in modulating cell fate and tissue growth has been also supported in preclinical models in which a reduced islet mass followed by dysglycemia was observed in the presence of constitutive overexpression of IGFBP321. In this study, we hypothesize that IGFBP3 acts as a new regulator of beta-cell mass by binding the death receptor TMEM219, which we demonstrate here is expressed in islet beta cells, thus promoting beta-cell loss. Pharmacological or genetic targeting of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway successfully protects beta-cell mass, facilitates beta-cell expansion, and prevents and delays diabetes onset, suggesting a new therapeutic option for diabetic patients."

                        "To identify novel pathways potentially involved in beta cells homeostasis, we performed transcriptome profiling in purified human islets of non-diabetic donors with a particular focus on islet surface proteins. The death receptor TMEM219 was one of the most highly expressed (Fig.\u00a01a) and ranked the third most abundant beta-cell receptor among all those subsequently quantified by targeted qRT-PCR analysis (Fig.\u00a01b). Expression of TMEM219 in purified human islets was further confirmed by confocal imaging (Fig.\u00a01c), with flow-sorted islet-derived insulin-positive cells expressing higher TMEM219 mRNA as compared to islet-derived insulin-negative cells (Fig.\u00a01d). Interestingly, TMEM219 was the sole IGFBP3 receptor expressed on beta cells, as the mRNA expression of other putative IGFBP3 receptors (e.g., low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, LRP1, TGF-\u03b2 Type 1, and Type 2 Receptor) was undetectable (Fig.\u00a01e). Moreover, TMEM219 expression was also evident by immunoblotting (Fig.\u00a01f), by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a), and flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a01g) analysis, the latter performed on insulin-positive cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b) and confirming a higher percentage of TMEM219+ cells within the insulin-positive fraction (Fig.\u00a01g, h). We next analyzed two human immortalized beta-cell lines and human alpha cells and showed that TMEM219 protein and mRNA are barely detectable on alpha cells, with nearly threefold and 80-fold increased expression in beta cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c\u2013f), where colocalization with insulin was also evident by confocal imaging analysis (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01g).Fig. 1The death receptor TMEM219 is expressed in islet beta cells.a The transcriptome profile of genes encoding islet surface proteins was screened using RNA-seq of islets isolated from non-diabetic donors (n\u2009=\u20094).

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "As TMEM219 is expressed on islet beta cells, we next assessed whether peripheral levels of TMEM219 ligand IGFBP3 were altered in patients with diabetes. Of note, we observed increased peripheral IGFBP3 in patients with established T1D, in those with new-onset T1D, and, although to a lesser extent, in those at risk for developing the disease (based on the detection of one or more anti-islet autoantibodies) as compared to non-diabetic healthy volunteers (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Table\u00a01). This observation was paralleled in patients with newly diagnosed T2D and in those with impaired glucose tolerance, as compared to patients with normal glucose tolerance (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Table\u00a02), and further confirmed in obese diabetic patients selected to undergo bariatric surgery (Fig.\u00a02c). Interestingly, the analysis of glycometabolic parameters in a cohort of individuals at risk for T2D and enrolled within a subgroup of the GENFIEV study revealed that peripheral IGFBP3 levels were higher in patients with 1-h OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) plasma glucose level >155\u2009mg/dl, which is a strong predictor of T2D development (Fig.\u00a02d). By further dividing fold changes of IGFBP3 observed in this population into quartiles, we demonstrated that elevated IGFBP3 levels were associated with higher HbA1c, higher fasting plasma-glucose levels, lower insulin sensitivity, and lower insulin-secretion rate (Fig.\u00a02e\u2013h), thus supporting the association between dysregulated IGFBP3 and beta-cell dysfunction. Indeed, peripheral levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), of which IGFBP3 is the main circulating carrier, were altered only to some extent in diabetic and pre-diabetic conditions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a, b), thus suggesting a greater increase in IGFBP3 as compared to IGF-I, as shown also by the IGFBP3/IGF-I ratio (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c, d). This was also supported by demonstrating that plasma levels of IGF-II, which is also carried by IGFBP3 in the circulation, were comparable in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, and by further confirming increased peripheral IGFBP3 in diabetes through Luminex technology (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e\u2013h) and by validating the analysis through a clinically grade electrochemiluminescence immune-assay (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02i). The dysregulation of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis was confirmed in two additional highly relevant cohorts of patients (Supplementary Tables\u00a03 and 4): (i) diabetic patients undergoing liver transplantation (Fig.\u00a02i and Supplementary Table\u00a03), in which those who near-normalized their glycometabolic control after transplantation (regressor) showed a significant reduction in peripheral IGFBP3 as compared to those who remained diabetic (non-regressor); and (ii) islet-transplanted patients, in which partially successful islet transplantation in T1D (i.e., achieving C-peptide higher than 0.4\u2009ng/ml after transplant) was associated with lower peripheral IGFBP3 levels as compared to higher IGFBP3 levels observed in failing islet transplantation (Fig.\u00a02j). In order to understand the basis for increased production of IGFBP3, which is primarily released by the liver, we cultured a human hepatocytes-derived cell line (Huh7) in vitro with sera of diabetic T1D or T2D patients in place of regular FBS and demonstrated increased secretion of IGFBP3 as compared to IGFBP3 levels measured in the culture of hepatocytes exposed to sera obtained from healthy volunteers (CTRL) or to high-glucose medium (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02j). Elevated IGFBP3 hepatocytes production was also obtained during a challenge with a diabetogenic pro-inflammatory milieu (IL-1\u03b2\u2009+\u2009/\u2212 IFN-\u03b3, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02k). Interestingly, immune neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 and/or IFN-\u03b3 fully abrogated the increased IGFBP3 hepatic production observed upon T1D/T2D sera exposure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02j). Given the altered IGFBP3 levels observed in diabetic patients, we interrogated TMEM219 expression in laser-captured islets through RNA sequencing and confirmed it in healthy subjects, patients with T1D, with T2D or at risk for T1D, without any difference among groups (Fig.\u00a02k). In summary, these data suggest that a dysfunctional IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway is associated with a disrupted beta-cell homeostasis.Fig. 2Peripheral levels of TMEM219 ligand IGFBP3 are altered in diabetic patients.a Scatter plots representing fold increase in peripheral IGFBP3 in patients with established T1D (n\u2009=\u200930), with new-onset T1D (n\u2009=\u200945), at risk for developing T1D (with at least one detected autoantibody, pre-T1D, n\u2009=\u200930), as compared to non-diabetic healthy controls (CTRL, n\u2009=\u200930).

                        "To next demonstrate the effect of IGFBP3-mediated TMEM219 signaling in pancreatic beta cells, we first challenged purified human islets obtained from healthy subjects and not suitable for donation, with IGFBP3 in vitro and observed a higher rate of apoptosis/cell death (Fig.\u00a03a). Next, we demonstrated by flow cytometry and immunostaining that this IGFBP3-mediated detrimental effect is evident mainly in insulin-positive cells (Fig.\u00a03b, c, d, e, f). A transcriptome profiling conducted on whole islets showed a marked upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes (i.e., CASP8, CASP9, TP53BP2, TNFSF10, FAS) in IGFBP3-challenged islets as compared to untreated islets (Fig.\u00a03g, Supplementary Table\u00a05), with Caspase 8 observed to be the most highly abundant when its relative expression was compared to other pro-apoptotic genes. Indeed, Caspase-8 expression was confirmed to be upregulated also in flow-sorted human islet insulin-positive cells during IGFBP3 challenge in vitro (Fig.\u00a03h) and in laser-captured islets of T1D and T2D patients as compared to those of healthy subjects (Fig.\u00a03i). The upregulated Caspase-8 mRNA expression was paralleled by an increase in cleaved Caspase 8 in IGFBP3-cultured islets and confirmed an IGFBP3-mediated Caspase-8 activation (Fig.\u00a03j). Interestingly, flow-sorted human islet insulin-positive cells also showed an alteration in the expression of the insulin secretory machinery-related genes SYMC, IAPP, and PTPRN2, during IGFBP3 challenge in vitro (Fig.\u00a03k), which was associated with a dysregulation in insulin granules size and number in purified human islets and motility in beta-cell line (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b). A decreased insulin secretion at baseline and upon glucose stimulation in IGFBP3-cultured human islets further demonstrated the detrimental effect of IGFBP3 in beta-cell function (Fig.\u00a03l, m). Indeed, our transcriptome analysis also showed that insulin gene expression (INS) was lowest in its abundance amongst all beta-cell-related genes in IGFBP3-cultured islets, and that expression of transcripts linked to insulin signaling/secretion (e.g., IRS1, MAPK1, FBP1, PPTN1) was significantly altered (Supplementary Table\u00a06). To next demonstrate that IGFBP3-mediated apoptosis of beta cells was triggered through the activation of TMEM219 death signaling in beta cells, we targeted TMEM219 in human islets using siRNA (Fig.\u00a03n, o) and observed that Caspase 8 and insulin expression were preserved despite the addition of IGFBP3 (Fig.\u00a03p, q). Interestingly, silencing of TMEM219 also abrogated the IGFBP3-mediated effect on Caspase 8 and re-established the physiological AKT activation, which is involved in preserving cell survival and was blocked when IGFBP3 was added to the culture (Fig.\u00a03r and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c). Conversely, no effect was evident on another IGFBP3-related pathway, which finely controls cell proliferation/death, the ERK1/2 (Fig.\u00a03r and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d, e), thus suggesting that Caspase-8 activation and AKT-blockade are engaged in the IGFBP3/TMEM219-dependent cell death/apoptosis signaling cascade. Finally, blockade of IGF-I/IGF-IR did not prevent IGFBP3-mediated islet apoptosis in vitro, thus suggesting that IGFBP3 is not acting solely by blocking the survival effect of ambient IGFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03f). To further determine whether higher peripheral IGFBP3 levels favor islet injury in disease conditions such as diabetes, we challenged human islets with sera obtained from patients with either T1D or T2D, which are naturally enriched in IGFBP3 as compared to those of healthy subjects, in place of regular FBS, and confirmed increased Caspase 8 and decreased insulin mRNA expression (Fig.\u00a03s, t). To better address the engagement of IGFBP3 as circulating in blood with TMEM219 expressed in target cells, we first demonstrated, through analysis of immunofluorescence distribution at the single-cell level, a colocalization between serum IGFBP3 and TMEM219 in beta cells cultured in vitro with T1D serum, which was not evident in those cultured with non-diabetic serum or with FBS (Fig.\u00a03u and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03g, h). Next, TMEM219-expressing beta cells cultured with T1D serum, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TMEM219 antibody and the immunoblotting analysis of the precipitate confirmed that TMEM219 interacts with serum IGFBP3 (Fig.\u00a03v). We finally conducted a series of experiments in which a recombinant protein, ecto-TMEM219, which we have generated by cloning the extracellular domain of TMEM219 receptor and acts by preventing the IGFBP3/TMEM219 binding, was used to pharmacologically block the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway. Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic Caspase-8-associated effect and reduction in insulin expression and release induced by IGFBP3 exposure in vitro were rescued by ecto-TMEM219 in purified human islets (Fig.\u00a03a, b, d, j and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03i, j). Ecto-TMEM219 was also able to re-establish the physiological expression of Caspase 8 and insulin mRNA in purified human islets upon culture with serum of either T1D or T2D patients in place of regular FBS, and as compared with the serum of healthy subjects (Fig.\u00a03s, t). Lastly, all the aforementioned experiments performed in a human beta-cell line (Blox-5) mechanistically confirmed the effects of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway and of Ecto-TMEM219 pharmacological blockade on beta cells by faithfully replicating our observations in human islets (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). The dose-effect correlation between Caspase 8 and cell death upon IGFBP3 exposure (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a\u2013c) and the abrogation of the Caspase-8-associated beta-cell apoptosis obtained through the depletion of IGFBP3 from the T1D/T2D serum or with the use of an anti-IGFBP3 monoclonal antibody during the serum challenge of beta cells, further reinforced our findings (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f). The abrogation of Caspase-8 activation with a selective Caspase-8 inhibitor, despite some experimental limitations22, and through TMEM219 silencing by siRNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04g), also supported the IGFBP3-mediated Caspase-8 effect in beta cells. In summary, we demonstrated that the IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling is deleterious for beta cells via a Caspase-8 activation/AKT inhibition mechanism, and that IGFBP3/TMEM219 blockade may prevent beta-cell death/dysfunction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04h).Fig. 3IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling triggers beta-cell apoptosis.a Bar graph quantifying apoptosis in human islets cultured with/without IGFBP3 and in the presence/absence of ecto-TMEM219 (n\u2009=\u20093).

                        "In order to assess the relevance of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis and its blockade in preserving the beta-cell homeostasis in vivo in preclinical models, we first demonstrated that TMEM219 is expressed in murine pancreas and purified islets of C57BL/6J (B6) mice (Fig.\u00a04a, b). TMEM219 protein and mRNA expression were also shown by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR, and the lack of expression of other IGFBP3 receptors within murine pancreatic islets was further confirmed (Fig.\u00a04b, c). In vitro experiments also showed that the addition of IGFBP3 to purified islets of B6 mice was associated with increased apoptosis, upregulated Caspase 8, and decreased insulin expression (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f). Interestingly, blockade of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway in vitro with ecto-TMEM219 abrogated the IGFBP3-induced detrimental effects in murine pancreatic islets (Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f). To further confirm our observation in vivo, we first injected a short course of IGFBP3 (0.2\u2009mg daily for 5 days i.p.) in naive B6 mice and observed increased fasting blood glucose levels as compared to untreated controls (Fig.\u00a04g). We therefore interrogated the role of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis and its targeting in well-renown in vivo models of diabetes. First, in parallel with our observations in human patients, we demonstrated elevated peripheral IGFBP3 levels in B6 mice receiving or not a high-fat diet (HFD, Fig.\u00a04h), which recapitulates in vivo the features of T2D. As observed in human subjects, peripheral IGF-I levels were not altered in pre-diabetic and diabetic mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a), resulting in an elevated IGFBP3/IGF-I ratio (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b) that further confirmed the availability of a peripheral IGFBP3 fraction capable of binding TMEM219 on islet cells. We next tested the effect of IGFBP3/TMEM219 pharmacological blockade in the aforementioned preclinical T2D model and demonstrated that administration of the newly generated ecto-TMEM219 significantly reduced blood glucose levels and body weight when given to HFD-treated mice as compared to untreated controls (Fig.\u00a04i, j), and also showed reduced peripheral IGFBP3 levels (Fig.\u00a04k) and increased insulin level, while IGF-I level remained unaltered (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c, d). In a second model of beta-cell destruction and diabetes, multiple low doses of streptozotocin (ldSTZ, 50\u2009mg/Kg for 5 days), which induces beta-cell death such as that observed in diabetes, was administered to B6 mice. Interestingly, ecto-TMEM219 treatment successfully preserved blood glucose levels in treated mice as compared to untreated animals over time (Fig.\u00a04l), with an improvement also of the glucose AUC at the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), (Fig.\u00a04m and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05e) with no effect on body weight and fasting plasma insulin levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f, g). Reduced IGFBP3 plasma levels and preserved islet morphology further confirmed the beneficial effect of ecto-TMEM219-mediated IGFBP3 inhibition in this diabetes model (Fig.\u00a04n, o). To mechanistically link the preservation of beta cells with inhibition of IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling, we generated a TMEM219flox/flox mouse (Fig.\u00a04p and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a) and crossed this mouse with the INScre mouse model to obtain the Beta-TMEM219\u2212/\u2212 mouse, in which TMEM219 was conditionally deleted in pancreatic beta cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b, c). While peripheral insulin levels were comparable in Beta-TMEM219\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type (WT) mice, a decrease in plasma IGFBP3 levels was evident (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06d, e), thus suggesting a dysregulated IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis in this mouse model. Interestingly, the IPGTT revealed a slight improvement of the AUC glucose level in the Beta-TMEM219\u2212/\u2212 as compared to WT mice, particularly at the 60\u2009min peak, paralleled by an increased insulin level (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06f\u2013h). To further demonstrate the role of TMEM219 genetic targeting in beta cells, Beta-TMEM219\u2212/\u2212 mice were challenged with a multiple low-dose of streptozotocin and showed significantly lower blood glucose level over time as compared to WT mice (Fig.\u00a04q). Notably, low-dose-streptozotocin injected Beta-TMEM219\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated an improvement in the IPGTT glucose AUC (Fig.\u00a04r), both at the 30 and 60\u2009min time points (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06i), a reduced IGFBP3 plasma level (Fig.\u00a04s), and a preserved islet morphology (Fig.\u00a04t). The aforementioned data confirmed the protective effect exerted by IGFBP3/TMEM219 pharmacologic targeting and TMEM219 genetic ablation in vivo on beta cells.Fig. 4Targeting IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling protects beta cells in preclinical models of diabetes in vivo.a Bar graph showing TMEM219 protein expression (ELISA) assessed in the whole pancreas and dissociated pancreatic islets obtained from B6 mice (n\u2009=\u20094).

                        "We finally investigated the role of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis and its targeting in the NOD mouse, which spontaneously develops T1D and recapitulates in vivo its features. First, we demonstrated that TMEM219 is expressed in pancreatic islets of NOD mice (Fig.\u00a05a, b). Next, we paralleled our observations in human patients by demonstrating elevated peripheral IGFBP3 levels in pre-diabetic and diabetic non-obese-diabetic (NOD) mice (Fig.\u00a05c). In particular, higher IGFBP3 plasma levels were found in 4-weeks and 10-week-old NOD mice, which are not hyperglycemic yet and in which beta cells are still detectable but already exhibit insulitis and islet-autoimmunity. However, in long-term normoglycemic NOD mice, which represent ~20\u201330% of female NOD mice that are normoglycemic at 26\u201330 weeks of age and do not develop diabetes, and in NOR mice resistant to diabetes, peripheral IGFBP3 levels were not increased (Fig.\u00a05c). As observed in human subjects, peripheral IGF-I levels were not altered in pre-diabetic and diabetic NOD mice (Fig.\u00a05d), resulting in an elevated IGFBP3/IGF-I ratio (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06j), which again highlighted the availability of a peripheral IGFBP3 fraction that may bind TMEM219 on islet cells. To better understand the role of IGFBP3/TMEM219 in controlling the beta-cell mass in vivo in disease conditions such as T1D, we pharmacologically modulated IGFBP3-mediated signaling with ecto-TMEM219 in a T1D prevention study in 10-week-old normoglycemic NOD mice. IGFBP3/TMEM219 blockade with ecto-TMEM219 prevented the onset of diabetes in nearly 75% of treated mice (up to 80%), while only 25% of control mice were protected from diabetes in the untreated group (Fig.\u00a05e). Islet pathology studies demonstrated significant preservation of islet morphology and area in ecto-TMEM219-treated mice, with low islet infiltration and reduced peripheral IGFBP3 levels as compared to untreated controls (Fig.\u00a05f\u2013j). Of note, prolonged IGFBP3/TMEM219 blockade with ecto-TMEM219 was associated with significant beta-cell expansion, which lead to a significant increase of both islet area and peripheral insulin levels (Fig.\u00a05f, h, k and Supplementary Fig.\u00a06k), mimicking nesidioblastosis. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a reduction in the autoimmune response in ecto-TMEM219-treated NOD mice, when splenocytes were re-challenged in vitro with the CD4 and CD8-restricted islet peptides BDC2.5 and IGRP in an IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay (Fig.\u00a05l). This observation was paralleled with a slight decrease in effector memory CD8 T cells and a small increase in Treg population observed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig.\u00a05m\u2013o). Finally, ecto-TMEM219 was tested in a diabetes reversal NOD mouse model, in which hyperglycemic NOD mice were treated with ecto-TMEM219 within 24\u2009h from the onset of hyperglycemia and demonstrated preserved blood glucose levels, with 25% of mice remaining normoglycemic until the completion of the study at day 20 (Fig.\u00a05p, q), and no detectable islet infiltration/inflammation (Fig.\u00a05r). In summary, these data demonstrate a protective effect of targeting the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis on beta cells in vivo also in autoimmune diabetes.Fig. 5Targeting IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling protects beta cells in the NOD mouse in vivo.a Bar graph depicting Tmem219 mRNA expression analyzed by qRT-PCR in pancreata of NOD mice (n\u2009=\u20093, 5, and 4 per group). b Representative immunohistochemical TMEM219 staining in serial pancreatic islet tissue sections from NOD mice (n\u2009=\u20093). \u00d740 original magnification, scale bar, 50\u2009\u03bcm. c, d Bar graph depicting peripheral IGFBP3 (c) and IGF-I (d) levels measured in plasma obtained from 8-week-old B6 (n\u2009=\u200910) mice, in pre-diabetic (4-week and 10-week-old, n\u2009=\u20094) and diabetic (hyperglycemic, n\u2009=\u20095) NOD mice, in mice resistant to the development of autoimmune diabetes (NOR, n\u2009=\u20093) and in long-term normoglycemic (LtNglc, 26-week-old, n\u2009=\u20094) NOD mice. e Ten-week-old NOD mice were treated with ecto-TMEM219 (0.1\u2009mg/mouse/day for 10 days or 0.1\u2009mg/mouse/day for 10 days and twice per week or were left untreated (n\u2009=\u200920/group), and the incidence of diabetes was then compared using the log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test (**P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***P\u2009<\u20090.001). f Bar graph depicting semi-quantitative analysis of islet area in pancreatic sections obtained from ecto-TMEM219-treated and untreated NOD mice after 14 weeks of treatment (n\u2009=\u20094/group).

                "While factors that promote beta-cell growth and replication have been extensively studied17,23,24, the mechanisms that lead to beta-cell loss remain far from being fully understood. Several stress factors have been identified as playing a role in beta-cell dysfunction and injury3,4. The present study demonstrates that the death receptor TMEM219 is expressed in islet beta cells and that, when bound to its ligand IGFBP3, TMEM219 induces Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis of beta cells, which leads to beta-cell loss. Moreover, the addition of IGFBP3 in vitro alters the insulin secretory machinery in beta cells, resulting in beta-cell dysfunction. The observation that IGFBP3 levels are increased in patients with T1D or T2D and in those at risk for developing diabetes, as well as in pre-diabetic and diabetic mice, suggests a dysregulation of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway in the context of diabetes. Conflicting and too little data exist in the literature with regard to IGFBP3 circulating levels in patients with T1D25 and T2D26,27, which are often assessed in heterogeneous populations of patients (Supplementary Table\u00a07), thus requiring further in-depth studies. Also, proteolysis of IGFBP3 have been detected at a high level in serum of patients with T1D28,29 and confirmed in our immunoprecipitation studies. Indeed, in preclinical models, constitutive overexpression of IGFBP3 was associated with reduced islet mass and dysglycemia21, and our results demonstrate that short-term IGFBP3 exposure in vivo alters glycometabolic control in naive mice, although diabetes itself may alter IGFBP3 distribution and clearance30, thus indicating that elevated IGFBP3 levels are involved in beta-cell loss/dysfunction. As a proof-of-concept, blockade of IGFBP3/TMEM219 signaling in vitro by silencing TMEM219 via siRNA delivery prevented IGFBP3-mediated apoptosis/damage of beta cells and restored insulin expression and secretion. More importantly, the use of a newly generated recombinant protein based on the TMEM219 extracellular domain (ecto-TMEM219), which inhibits the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway, protected beta cells in vitro and prevented the onset of hyperglycemia in murine models of diabetes in vivo. This was also confirmed when TMEM219 was genetically deleted on beta cells. Interestingly, prolonged inhibition of TMEM219 signaling using ecto-TMEM219 treatment appeared to prevent normal beta-cell turnover and increased peripheral insulin levels to the point that the beta-cell mass markedly expanded, almost mimicking nesidioblastosis. We should also acknowledge a possible effect on the immune system. The limited IGFBP3-mediated beta-cell loss may result in a reduced delivery of islet autoantigens to the circulation and to pancreatic lymph nodes, thus dampening the priming/activation of autoreactive T cells. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the IGFBP3/TMEM219 pathway may serve as a physiological controller of beta cells and their lifespan, and that this pathway is dysregulated in diabetes. As reduced beta-cell mass and function are commonly observed in T1D and T2D2,31,32, usually associated with increased beta-cell apoptotic rate12,14,33\u201335, discovery of surface beta-cell receptors that negatively regulate cell survival and that may make beta cells more susceptible to stress factors or to immune-mediated attack is of significant importance in order to understand ways in which the beta-cell pool can be preserved. The increased hepatic production of IGFBP3 observed in vitro upon exposure to either T1D or T2D serum and the abrogation obtained by targeting the pro-inflammatory microenvironment further suggest a common path of dysregulation for the IGFBP3/TMEM219 axis in diabetes. We cannot exclude that the use of ecto-TMEM219 may interfere with other factors such as IGF-I, IGF-II, and other IGFBPs (e.g., IGFBP1), including their interaction with the IGF-IR, all potentially involved in regulating beta-cell homeostasis, although our data do not suggest the existence of the aforementioned issues. In summary, when abnormally released into the circulation, IGFBP3 may act as a circulating toxic factor for beta cells (Betatoxin) that ultimately causes beta-cell death and dysfunction through TMEM219 activation. The discovery of circulating factors involved in the initiation/facilitation of beta-cell injury and associated with a reduction in beta-cell mass in diabetes is of significant importance for the development of therapies for T1D and T2D. Such discoveries may pave the way for therapeutic approaches capable of halting or delaying the disease by targeting the process that ultimately leads to insulin deficiency. Blockade of IGFBP3/TMEM219 may thus represent a novel therapeutic option for diabetic patients to preserve their insulin-producing beta-cell pool."
