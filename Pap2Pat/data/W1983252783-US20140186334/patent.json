                        "A technique for constructing and screening antibody libraries is phage display, whereby the protein of interest is expressed as a polypeptide fusion to a bacteriophage coat protein and subsequently screened by binding to immobilized or soluble biotinylated ligand.",
                        "Phage display, however, has several shortcomings. For example, some eukaryotic secreted proteins and cell surface proteins require post-translational modifications such as glycosylation or extensive disulfide isomerization, which are unavailable in bacterial cells.",
                        "Current yeast surface antibody display systems, such as cold capture, also suffer from various drawbacks. In the cold capture antibody display system, at low temperatures, the process of antibody release from host cell transport vesicles is delayed, so that the secreted antibody can be assayed on the cell surface for antigen binding. The cold capture method suffers from a low signal-to-noise ratio and identification of an antibody with specificity for the target antigen depends heavily on cellular expression levels of the antibody.",
                        "The affinity matrix system couples antibodies to the host cell surface, e.g., by biotin, where they can be assayed for antigen binding. The affinity matrix system exhibits a high incidence of cross-contamination between antibody clones. Antibodies may become decoupled from the host cell and, thus lose their link to the polynucleotides encoding their immunoglobulin chains.",
                        "Full length antibody display systems tether the full length antibody on the host cell surface by binding an immunoglobulin binding protein, such as protein A, that is fused to a cell surface anchor protein. The host cell contains polynucleotides encoding the antibody immunoglobulin chains. Typically, binding of the antibody occurs after the immunoglobulin binding protein is expressed on the cell surface. This system, thus, leads to some erroneous binding of the antibody to host cells that do not express the antibody."

In the endoplasmic reticulum, where antibody molecules normally dimerize to form the full antibody molecule, a surface anchored Fc fusion \u201cbait\u201d heterodimerizes with a monovalent antibody fragment creating a complex that is displayed on the cell surface. Monovalent antibody fragments on the cell surface can bind antigen.",

It provides a method for sorting a heterogeneous mixture of biological cells into two or more containers, one cell at a time, based upon the specific light scattering and fluorescent characteristics of each cell. During the cell sorting process, the cell suspension is entrained in the center of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of interest of each cell is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based on the immediately-prior fluorescence intensity measurement, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.

A polynucleotide encoding the N-terminus of a cell surface anchoring protein that inherently contains an attached glycophosphotidylinositol (GPI) post-translational modification that anchors the protein on the yeast cell wall was linked to a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the human IgG1 Fc region. The specific cell surface anchoring protein we used was S. cerevisiae Sed1 protein, which had been identified by screening a panel of cell wall of plasma membrane proteins that had been identified using GPI protein prediction software (described in international publication no. WO09/111,183).",
                                "To create the plasmid containing bait cassette, a codon optimized sequence of human IgG1 Fc fragment was synthesized using an EcoRI forward PCR primer containing the nucleic acid sequence of S. cerevisiae \u03b1-mating factor signal sequence fused upstream of the sequence encoding the IgG1 Fc N-terminus, and a SalI reverse primer encoding the C-terminus of IgG1 Fc that terminates in a sequence encoding a GGGG linker. A plasmid containing the anti-Her2 gene sequence was used as a PCR template for amplification of an EcoRI-\u03b1-mating factor signal sequence-Fc-GGGG-SalI fragment. Both PCR product and pGLY3033 (described in international publication no. WO09/111,183) were digested using EcoRI and SalI endonucleases. The EcoRI-SalI fragment encoding the Fc was ligated in frame to EcoRI-SalI pGLY3033 backbone to generate plasmid pGLY9008 (FIG. 2). This plasmid enables delivery of the Fc-SED1 cassette under the control of the Pichia pastoris AOX1 promoter sequence. Like the parent plasmid it contains, the Pichia pastoris URA6 gene sequence, which serves as an integration locus in the genome, and the arsenite resistance gene, to allow selection on media containing sodium aresnite.",

An empty strain was included as a control (Table 1).",
                                "The glycoengineered Pichia pastoris monoclonal antibody production strains in Table 1 were grown in 50 mL BMGY media until the culture optical density, at 600 nm, was 2. The cells were washed three times with 1 M sorbitol and resuspended in 1 mL 1 M sorbitol. About 1-2 micrograms of SpeI linearized pGLY9008 was mixed with these competent cells. Transformation was performed with a BioRad electroporation apparatus using the manufacturer's program specific for electroporation of nucleic acids into Pichia pastoris.

                                "Glycoengineered yeast expressing human IgGs and the Fc-SED1 bait expression cassette were inoculated using 600 \u03bcL BMGY in a 96 deep well plate or 50 mL BMGY in a 250 mL shake flasks for two days. The cells were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were induced by incubation in 300 \u03bcL or 25 mL BMMY with PMTi inhibitor overnight following the methods described in international application publication no. WO2007/061631. Following induction, culture supernatants were assayed for antibody expression using Kappa ELISA, according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Protein A capture SDS-PAGE analysis. The data in FIGS. 3a and b, respectively, describe the results of both of these assays. As outlined in FIG. 3, supernatants of cultures containing the Fc-Sed1 protein bait were found to contain similar levels of secreted full antibody molecules (2 heavy chain immunoglobulins and 2 light chain immunoglobulins ((H2+L2)) compared to their parent strains (containing no Fc-Sedlp). This indicated that the presence of the Fc-Sedlp bait did not interfere with the yeast ability to secret full IgG antibodies (H2+L2).",
                                "To determine the efficiency of surface displaying antibodies using this method, cells were labeled with APC 635 labeled mouse anti-Human Kappa, which detects the light chain of human antibody molecules, and were processed by flow cytometry. Briefly, each culture, after growth to an optical density, at 600 nm, of 2, was pelleted by centrifugation and washed in 100 \u03bcL PBS. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) in 100 \u03bcL phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing fluorescently labeled (APC635) mouse anti-human Kappa light chain and washed in 100 \u03bcl PBS. One hundred microliters of PBS was used to resuspend pellets before analyzing in a flow cytometer.",
                                "Flow cytometry analysis was conducted using the cells co-expressing Fc-Sedlp bait and anti-Her2, or Fc-Sedlp bait and anti-PCSK9. Controls were prepared in which an empty strain expressing Fc-Sedlp bait only or a strain that expressed full length antibody (H2+L2) without the Fc-Sedlp. Strains co-expressing anti-Her2 or anti-PCSK9 with the Fc-Sedlp bait were found to display significant levels of anti-Kappa binding while strains lacking the Fc-Sedlp bait showed background signal levels. In FIG. 4a-c, the fluorescent intensities from these experiments were compared. The Figure shows these different fluorescence intensities between the anti-Her2 displaying cells and the anti-PCSK9 displaying cells, and the parent strains that did not contain the Fc-Sedlp bait. It is noteworthy to mention that anti-Her2 displaying cells showed higher fluorescence intensity than the anti-PCSK9 displaying cells. These results were in congruence with what was known regarding expression levels of these two antibodies.",
                                "To establish the utility of this method for separating antibody mixtures, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of a mixture of cells displaying Fc-Sedlp anti-PCSK9 monovalent antibody fragment (H+L) (strain YGLY21610) and Fc-Sedlp anti-Her2 (H+L) (strain YGLY21614) was performed as follows. The cells displaying anti-PCSK9 (H+L) and cells displaying anti-Her2 (H+L) were mixed together in the following ratio 1:0; 0:1; and 1:100. Cells were dually labeled with goat anti-human Fc Alexa 488 and 100 nM biotinylated PCSK9 and APC 635 labeled Streptavidin. FIG. 5 shows that Fc-Sedlp/anti-PCSK9 (H+L) was able to bind biotinylated PCSK9 while Fc-Sedlp/anti-Her2 (H+L) was not. Both strains reacted with anti-human Fc Alexa 488 antibody. Two separate populations of cells were visible when cells from both cultures were mixed at a 1:100 ratio of Fc-Sedlp anti-PCSK9 displaying cells (circled) to Fc-Sedlp anti-Her2 displaying cells. The number of PCSK9 binders in this mixture was in agreement with the 1:100 ratio, thus lending further support for the robustness of this method in screening antibodies with desired antigen-binding.",
                                "The above experiments demonstrated that the Fc-Sedlp antibody display system can be used to display IgG monovalent antibody fragments (H+L) that retain specific antigen binding of their corresponding full antibody molecules (H2+L2) dimers. The next goal was to use this method to isolate and enrich for novel antibody molecules that can bind to any antigen of interest. To this end we took advantage of two recently constructed libraries. Library one was constructed by changing the sequence of the heavy chain of anti-PCSK9 antibody AX189 while marinating the original light chain sequence. This library had a diversity of about 2500 unique sequences and will be referred to as \u201cBP550\u201d. The second library was generated by maintaining the original AX189 heavy chain sequence and changing the light chain sequence. This library contained about 4000 unique sequences and will be referred to as \u201cBP551\u201d.",
                                "BP550 and BP551 were transformed as described previously into strain YGLY21605 (empty 5.0 strain carrying pGLY9008-expressing Fc-Sed1p) and plated out on YSD containing 300 micrograms per milliliter zeocin. Approximately, 50,000 colonies were obtained for each transformation, thus providing ample statistical coverage of all possible sequences in the libraries. The colonies resulting from transforming the two libraries were scraped off the solid media and inoculated separately in 250 mL shake flasks containing 50 mL of YSG liquid medium with 300 \u03bc/mL zeocin. The cultures were passaged 3 times by re-inoculating 1 mL of each culture into the fresh selective liquid media (YSG+zeocin). The third passages were allowed to grow to saturation in YSG media and induced in 25 mL BMMY with PMTi inhibitor (PMTi4: L000001772; at a concentration of 1 micrograms/ml) overnight following the methods described in international patent publication no. WO2007/061631. Strains YGLY21610 (Fc-Sedlp anti-PCSK9 (AX189)) and YGLY21614 (Fc-Sedlp anti-Her2) were included as positive and negative controls, respectively.",
                                "After 24 hours of induction, each of the four cultures were grown to an optical density, at 600 nm, of 2. Pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed with 100 \u03bcL 1\u00d7PBS then labeled in 100 \u03bcL PBS containing anti-Kappa Alexa 488 and 100 nM of biotin-PCSK9. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes then washed with 100 \u03bcL PBS solution. Cells were incubated at room temperature with APC 635 labeled Streptavidin in 100 \u03bcL PBS for 10 minutes and washed 2\u00d7 in PBS and submitted for FACS.",

Cultures were allowed to recover by shaking at room temperature for 5 days. Sorting round 1 pools were re-inoculated in 50 mL YSG liquid media and the same process was repeated to induce and label the cultures. Another round of sorting (round 2) was conducted on the round 1 pool and cells were collected as above and induced. To obtain single colonies, 1000 cells of both two-round sorted populations (BP550 and BP551) were plated out of solid media and were analyzed by Kappa ELISA and PCSK9 affinity ELISA to determine protein titer and binding affinities for PCSK9, respectively.",
                                "Additionally, a yeast colony PCR amplification reaction was performed to amplify heavy chain and light chain genes of the round 2 clones which were submitted for DNA sequence analysis.",
                                "As shown in FIG. 6, two rounds of sorting using biotinylated PCSK9 antigen resulted in significant enrichment of specific PCSK9 binders. The PCSK9 ELISA compared presorted library to round 2 sorted pools for both BP550 and BP551 (FIG. 7). Round 2 sorted pools from both libraries contained a high percentage of binders over the presorted populations. DNA sequencing confirmed the enrichment for new anti-PCSK9 binding sequences.",
