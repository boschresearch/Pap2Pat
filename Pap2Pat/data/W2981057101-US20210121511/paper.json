    "title": "Transplanting Fecal Virus-Like Particles Reduces High-Fat Diet-Induced Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Mice",

    "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective tool for treating Clostridium difficile infection in the setting of dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome. FMT for other forms of human disorders linked to dysbiosis have been less effective. The fecal microbiota contains a high density of virus-like particles (VLP), up to 90% of which are bacteriophages, thought to have a role in regulating gut bacterial populations. We hypothesized that transplantation of the phage-containing fecal VLP fraction may reduce bacterial density in the dysbiotic setting of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). In an experiment using fecal transplantation, we compared the effect of the fecal VLP fraction (bacteria removed) against Whole FMT (bacteria intact) on the ileal microbiome. Recipients were either treated with a 30-day high-fat diet (HFD) as a model of dysbiosis to induce SIBO or were on a standard diet (SD). We observed that transplantation of fecal VLPs from donors on a HFD was sufficient to alter the ileal microbiota, but the effect was dependent on diet of the recipient. In recipients on a HFD, ileal bacterial density was reduced. In recipients on a SD, the ileal microbiome transitioned toward the composition associated with a HFD. In both recipient groups, transplantation of fecal VLP fraction alone produced the same outcome as whole FMT. Neither treatment altered expression of antimicrobial peptides. These findings demonstrated a potential role of VLPs, likely phages, for modifying the gut microbiome during dysbiosis.",

                "During fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a large population of virus-like particles (VLPs) are transferred into the gastrointestinal tract of the recipient. There is an estimated population of 109 VLPs per gram of feces, a population density equal to that of fecal bacteria (Kim et al., 2011). Bacteriophages (phages) make up ~90% of VLPs in a healthy gut virome (Reyes et al., 2012) and have been observed to modulate the composition, structure, and function of gut microbial communities (Abeles and Pride, 2014; Kim and Bae, 2016; Bao et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2018; Moreno-Gallego et al., 2019). The gut phage community has also been associated with microbial \u201cdysbiosis\u201d (herein referred to as a microbiome state significantly associated with decreased health) in such disorders as Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, and colorectal cancer (P\u00e9rez-Brocal et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2013; Norman et al., 2015). Whether phages have a direct role in causing or preventing dysbiosis is unknown but the possibility is both an important concern with regards to existing FMT treatments and promising implication for future microbiome-targeting therapies.",
                "Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a form of dysbiosis characterized by increased colonization of the small intestinal mucosa by resident bacteria (Lin, 2004). SIBO may be induced by a variety of disruptors of the gut including a high-fat diet (HFD) (Tomas et al., 2016) and is commonly treated with antibiotic therapy. This approach is not always effective and recurrence of SIBO is common (Lauritano et al., 2008; Pimentel et al., 2009). Phage therapy is an alternative antibacterial treatment option that has not yet been investigated for SIBO. Historically, strain-specific phage therapy has been used to kill a targeted bacterial pathogen at a specific site of infection (Lin et al., 2017). It is not known whether a diverse population of phages, such as that represented in the fecal VLP fraction could be used to reduce colonization by a diverse population of resident bacteria across a large surface area such as the small intestinal mucosa.",
                "The present study is an investigation into the impact of donor-derived fecal VLPs on the gut microbiome of recipients during FMT. Donor mice were treated with a HFD, and their feces were transplanted either whole (FMT) or processed to remove bacteria (VLP) into the gut of recipient mice that were fed either a HFD or a standard diet (SD). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that transplantation of an extracted fraction of fecal VLPs may reduce bacterial density of the small intestinal mucosa by comparing the effects of these two transplants (FMT vs. VLP) on mucosa-associated bacterial density and gut microbiome composition."

A total of thirty-six 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used. Mice were randomized into two dietary groups (n = 18 each): SD or HFD (Figure 1A). Mice from each dietary group were further randomized into three treatment groups: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control, FMT, or VLP. The recipient groups are named according to their \u201cDiet-Treatment\u201d (n = 6 each): SD-PBS, SD-FMT, SD-VLP; HFD-PBS, HFD-FMT, HFD-VLP. All HFD mice were given a 30-day treatment of a custom HFD (TD.170686, Envigo, Madison, WI; 40% lard by weight) before being transitioned to a standard mouse diet (2920X.10, Envigo, Madison, WI) (Figure 1B); SD mice remained on the standard mouse diet for the entirety of the experiment. All recipient mice received 400 \u03bcL of their designated treatment via oral gavage into the stomach 24 h after the transition of HFD groups to the SD. Treatments were given once daily for 3 days and mice were sacrificed 24 h after final treatment at which point tissues were collected, gently washed to remove luminal contents, and stored in 200 proof ethanol at \u221280\u00b0C until processing. Fecal, not luminal, samples for microbiome analysis were collected and stored in 200 proof ethanol at \u221280\u00b0C prior to sacrifice."

Donor mice were randomized into subgroups of three (for a total of six subgroups); pooled samples from each subgroup provided transplants for four recipient mice: one each of SD-FMT, SD-VLP, HFD-FMT, and HFD-VLP (Figure 1A). Therefore, in each comparison, the VLP treatment was derived from the same fecal samples used for FMT, and each replicate recipient within a given treatment was biologically independent (i.e., receiving transplants from an independent subgroup). The processing steps involved homogenizing 1.0 g of fresh fecal samples from each subgroup, suspending in PBS, and separating into two aliquots of equal volume: one for processing into a FMT and one for extracting the VLPs (Figure 1C). For FMT treatments, the fecal suspension was minimally processed using only filtration of the fecal suspension through glass wool to remove of large particles and debris. The FMT fraction was used for both SD-FMT and HFD-FMT recipient groups.",
                        "VLPs are known to flocculate with particles in activated sludge (Brown et al., 2015), therefore we began VLP extraction by agitating the fecal suspension using 1 mm zirconia/silica beads and a bead beater to dislodge extracellular VLPs from fecal particulate matter. The suspension was then centrifuged at 5,000\u00d7 g for 10 min to pellet cells and large particles. The VLP-containing supernatant was subsequently filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter to remove bacteria (Carter, 1996). The bacteria-depleted fecal filtrate was then filtered further using an Amicon Ultra-4 100 kDa centrifugal filter (Millipore Sigma), which has a pore size small enough to capture all known VLPs (~3 nm; Bonilla et al., 2016). VLPs on the filter were washed 3\u00d7 with PBS and then resuspended in a volume of PBS equivalent to the starting volume of fecal suspension. The extracted fecal VLP fraction was used for both SD-VLP and HFD-VLP recipient groups. Samples of the extracted VLP fraction and flow through from the Amicon 100 kDa filter were examined using electron microscopy and flow cytometry to confirm absence/presence of phage.

In this analysis, there were no bacteria present, confirming the depletion of bacteria using filtration There was also no clearly identifiable non-phage VLPs, which is appropriate given the known predominance of phages in the fecal VLP fraction. Analysis of the SYBR Green I-stained VLP fraction using flow cytometry identified two distinct populations of VLPs, which could be differentiated based on level of fluorescence (Figure 3). Total events in 1.5 mL of extracted fecal VLP at a 1:1,000 dilution were significantly higher than in the flow through from 100 kDa filtration units (8415.7 \u00b1 347.7 and 167 \u00b1 50.5, respectively, p < 0.05) and the flow through was not significantly different from a PBS blank (142.7 \u00b1 35.8; p = 0.9). It should be noted that flow cytometry for viral enumeration is limited by significant background noise and these counts are not intended for quantitation but instead, to qualitatively demonstrate the presence of VLPs in the VLP fraction and absence in the flow through. No phages were found in the EM imaging of the flow through corroborating the finding from flow cytometry. These findings based on the \u201cPhage-on-Tap\u201d protocol by Bonilla et al. (2016) demonstrated that a combination of centrifugation and size filtration could effectively fractionate the fecal microbiota into a sub-bacterial fraction, which removes bacteria but retains VLPs, and a sub-viral fraction, which further removes VLPs."

Overall, there was a main effect of HFD associated with a reduction in Firmicutes relative to the SD group [F(1, 30) = 6.041, p < 0.0001], regardless of fecal transplant treatment, and there was no effect of treatment [F(2, 30) = 0.2868, p = 0.75] or interaction [F(2, 30) = 0.2576, p = 0.77]. At this point it is not known why only Proteobacteria, and not Firmicutes, expanded in response to the HFD but it may be associated with the transition back to a SD."

                "Following induction of SIBO using a 30-day HFD model, we found that bacterial density, as estimated by the relative quantitation of 16s rRNA, was significantly reduced in HFD recipients receiving either VLP or FMT transplants, as compared to HFD-PBS control mice. Specifically, recipients receiving either VLP or FMT, but not PBS, had bacterial densities statistically no different from that of SD-PBS control mice by the end of the experiment. In addition, transplanting either FMT or VLP from a HFD donor into SD recipients shifted their ileal microbiome toward a HFD-associated bacterial community composition. Together these findings suggest fecal VLPs were responsible for the observed effect.",
                "FMT is an established clinical treatment for recurrent C. difficile infection (Kassam et al., 2013) and has also been explored as a treatment for other dysbiosis-associated disorders (Vrieze et al., 2012; Colman and Rubin, 2014; Moayyedi et al., 2015; Heath et al., 2018; Gogokhia et al., 2019). The majority of FMT studies have been limited to the role of donor-derived fecal bacteria on the recipient's colonic microbiota (Pamer, 2014). However, in addition to fecal bacteria, FMT transfers a collection of host cells, protists, archaea, VLPs (~90% phages), fungi, and signaling molecules with no understanding of how those components affect the recipient (Reyes et al., 2012; Bojanova and Bordenstein, 2016). A recent clinical study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of these sub-bacterial components by using a fecal suspension filtered to remove bacteria as an effective clinical treatment of C. difficile infection (Ott et al., 2017). Understanding how these non-bacterial components interact with resident microbiota throughout the intestine is an essential next step in exploring the potential of FMT-based treatments for various forms of gut dysbiosis. Phages specifically are of interest for treatment of C. difficile infection, where successful resolution is associated with uptake of the donor's phage community (Zuo et al., 2018), and whether donor phages become established in the recipient is dependent on donor-recipient pairing (Draper et al., 2018).",
                "In the present study, we found that the outcome of administering a diverse phage population, as found in the fecal VLP fraction, depends on the diet-associated resident microbiota and gut environment of the recipient. One possible explanation for these diet-dependent effects of the VLP treatment lies in the evolutionary theory of local adaptation, where parasites become specialized to hosts from their local \u201csympatric\u201d environment and thus are less infective to hosts from other environments. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, phages infect a relatively narrow range of bacterial hosts, and previous work has found phages to locally adapt, exhibiting higher infectivity against local strains of bacteria relative to those collected from different locations (Vos et al., 2009; Koskella et al., 2011). A HFD produces characteristic changes to gut microbial community composition, such as an expansion in the relative proportion of Proteobacteria (Hildebrandt et al., 2009). Within the framework of local adaptation, the specialization of HFD-associated gut phages to HFD-associated gut bacteria may account for the divergent responses of HFD- and SD-associated gut bacteria in recipient mice to fecal phages derived from a HFD donor. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that neither FMT nor VLP reduced overall bacterial density in SD recipients. In fact, there were non-significant trends toward increased bacterial density in SD-VLP and FMT groups. The present study is focused on transplantation of HFD-associated VLPs to SD recipients to test whether an induced phenotype change in the donor could be transferred to a recipient using VLPs. Phage-mediated reduction in bacterial density mirrors the outcome of phage therapy, which utilizes strain-targeting phages to eliminate a particular pathogenic bacteria at the site of infection. It follows that administering a diverse population of phages (e.g., the fecal phage population) may eliminate a diverse population of bacteria (e.g., resident small intestinal bacteria). An analogous phage transplant study in a plant model also found a uniform reduction in overall bacterial density immediately after treatment with a diverse phage community, followed by a restructuring of the bacterial community 1-week post treatment (Morella et al., 2018). Our model was limited to a short-term analysis immediately after treatment and it is not known whether these changes will persist. We found that neither VLP nor FMT significantly altered the population density of resident small intestinal bacterial community composition in SD recipients but did transition small intestinal bacterial composition to resemble that of a HFD microbiome. Principal coordinates analysis of weighted UniFrac measures of 16s rRNA sequencing data found that SD mice treated with either FMT or VLP from a HFD donor clustered more with HFD mice than with SD-PBS controls as demonstrated on PCoA plots (Figure 7). This indicates that fecal VLPs alone were sufficient to drive microbiome composition toward that of the donor. The VLP treatment also activated the ileal microbiome in a way that increased alpha diversity of the mucosa-associated bacterial community in SD recipients (Figure 6). The compositional shift toward a HFD-associated microbiota in SD recipients after 3 days of treatment was accompanied by a trend toward increased ileal bacterial density. The observed impact on microbial community composition and diversity suggests a complex interaction between fecal VLPs and gut bacteria that goes beyond simple changes in abundance of bacterial members. While the mechanism of this outcome is outside the scope of this study, one hypothesis involves the phage-mediated horizontal transfer of genes from the HFD- to SD-associated microbiota during FMT or VLP treatment. Kim and Bae (2016) found an expansion of phage-encoded genes for bacterial fitness (e.g., bacterial metabolism) in the gut phageome in response to a HFD. These phages disproportionately target Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (Kim and Bae, 2018), two phyla that expand during HFD dysbiosis. Transfer of these phages into an SD recipient may provide a fitness advantage to resident bacteria in these phyla, allowing for their expansion in a way that changes microbial community composition to resemble the donor community. Future metagenomic analyses of donor and recipient viromes will be necessary to test this hypothesis.",
                "Exogenous phage administration for changing gut microbial community composition has been demonstrated in recent studies (Bao et al., 2018; Hsu et al., 2018). Using a defined community of resident gut bacteria (commensals) in a gnotobiotic mouse model, the addition of narrow host range phages can suppress populations of host bacteria which then indirectly impacts populations of non-host bacteria (Hsu et al., 2018). Bao et al. (2018) found that addition of either lytic or temperate phage monocultures into the gut can change relative abundances of bacterial populations at the phylum and genus level. Some evidence suggests that targeted phage therapy may be used to control specific bacterial pathogens in the gut environment, such as Enterococcus faecalis (Bolocan et al., 2019). Direct interactions between fecal VLPs and the host immune system may also shape the gut microbial community (Kernbauer and Cadwell, 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Van Belleghem et al., 2017; Gogokhia et al., 2019).",
                "A HFD, or \u201cWestern diet,\u201d is a well-known risk factor for numerous chronic diseases including metabolic dysfunction, cancer, and gastrointestinal disorders (Murphy et al., 2015). Accumulating evidence demonstrates that Western diet-induced dysbiosis is a driving force in the development of these diseases (Cani et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2017). The present study found that diets high in saturated fats can promote SIBO. Findings of SIBO are present in up to 78% of patients with IBS (Pimentel et al., 2000; Ghoshal et al., 2017); the exact contribution of diet to SIBO in these patients is not known. Currently, antibiotics are used to reduce bacterial density of the small intestine in SIBO. This strategy is only effective at eliminating symptoms of SIBO in 48% of patients with IBS and recurrence is common (Pimentel et al., 2000). The present study provides evidence for the intriguing possibility that fecal VLPs may be a potential modifier of the gut microbiome. Although VLPs from HFD donors reduced bacterial density of HFD recipients, this approach has limited clinical relevance since fecal transplants from dysbiotic donors may pose a risk for the recipient (Wong et al., 2017). Autologous FMT treatments have had some success in resolving antibiotic-induced dysbiosis (Suez et al., 2018), therefore autologous fecal VLP transplantation may be a less risky strategy to utilize the locally adapted phage population for treatment of SIBO.",
