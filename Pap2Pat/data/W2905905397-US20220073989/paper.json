    "title": "Optimizing Detection of Kidney Transplant Injury by Assessment of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA via Massively Multiplex PCR",
    "date": "2018-12-23",
    "abstract": "Standard noninvasive methods for detecting renal allograft rejection and injury have poor sensitivity and specificity. Plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) has been reported to accurately detect allograft rejection and injury in transplant recipients and shown to discriminate rejection from stable organ function in kidney transplant recipients. This study used a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based massively multiplexed PCR (mmPCR) methodology to measure dd-cfDNA in various types of renal transplant recipients for the detection of allograft rejection/injury without prior knowledge of donor genotypes. A total of 300 plasma samples (217 biopsy-matched: 38 with active rejection (AR), 72 borderline rejection (BL), 82 with stable allografts (STA), and 25 with other injury (OI)) were collected from 193 unique renal transplant patients; dd- cfDNA was processed by mmPCR targeting 13,392 SNPs. Median dd-cfDNA was significantly higher in samples with biopsy-proven AR (2.3%) versus BL (0.6%), OI (0.7%), and STA (0.4%) (p < 0.0001 all comparisons). The SNP-based dd-cfDNA assay discriminated active from non-rejection status with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, 88.7% sensitivity (95% CI, 77.7\u201399.8%) and 72.6% specificity (95% CI, 65.4\u201379.8%) at a prespecified cutoff (>1% dd-cfDNA). Of 13 patients with AR findings at a routine protocol biopsy six-months post transplantation, 12 (92%) were detected positive by dd-cfDNA. This SNP-based dd-cfDNA assay detected allograft rejection with superior performance compared with the current standard of care. These data support the feasibility of using this assay to detect disease prior to renal failure and optimize patient management in the case of allograft injury.",

                "Precision medicine and personalized tailoring of immunosuppressive drug regimens can improve the current state of organ transplant management [1]. Transplantation injuries may be delayed in detection, and therefore treated ineffectively, because diagnosis can be difficult and biopsy, an invasive and potentially morbid procedure, may be inconclusive. Though advances in immunosuppressive drugs, organ procurement methods, and human leukocyte antigen-typing have lowered the number of clinical- and biopsy-confirmed rejection episodes, sub-clinical rejection of kidney grafts remains a significant risk [2,3]. Kidney transplant management is particularly challenging owing to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the serum creatinine assay, which, in addition to the late detection of transplant injuries, makes immunosuppression dosage and adjustment far from personalized [4,5]. Therefore, rapid and non-invasive detection and prediction of allograft injury/rejection holds promise for improving the post-transplantation management of patients who have received kidney allografts.",
                "Diagnosis of renal transplant rejection is generally dependent on an increase in serum creatinine levels or its algorithmic derivative, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which indicates altered renal filtration functioning. Methods of estimating kidney rejection in allograft recipients based on serum creatinine or eGFR, however, lack sufficient accuracy. Since there are many causes of the baseline drift in altered renal filtering in these patients, biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. However, biopsies are invasive and costly procedures, which limit their use in clinical practice. Furthermore, biopsy results are often plagued by expert reader variance and can lead to delayed diagnosis of active rejection, after which irreversible organ damage may have occurred [6,7]. There is a current unmet need for a rapid, accurate, and noninvasive approach to detecting allograft rejection and/or injury\u2014one which may require integration of the current \u201cgold\u201d standard morphological assessments with modern molecular diagnostic tools [8].",
                "Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) detected in the blood of transplant recipients has been reported as a noninvasive marker to diagnose allograft injury/rejection [9,10,11,12], and holds promise for producing faster and more quantitative results compared with current diagnostic options. Recently, it was demonstrated that plasma dd-cfDNA fraction, typically between 0.3% and 1.2% in stable patients [13], can discriminate active rejection status from stable organ function in kidney transplant recipients [14]. Previously we validated the clinical application of a targeted, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based cell-free assay targeting greater than 10,000 loci as a successful screening tool for the detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities [15,16,17] and show here that a similar approach targeting 13,392 SNPs can be used to evaluate differences in donor cfDNA burden in different transplant rejection injuries over time. This study uses a novel SNP-based mmPCR-next generation sequencing (NGS) methodology to measure dd-cfDNA in renal transplant recipients for the detection of allograft rejection/injury without prior knowledge of donor genotypes."

In addition, some patients had serial post transplantation blood drawn as part of routine Internal Review Board approved bio-sampling studies.

Briefly, at each bootstrap step, a single sample was selected from each patient; by assuming independence among patients, the performance parameters and their standard errors were calculated. This was repeated 10,000 times; final confidence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap mean for the parameter with the average of the bootstrap standard errors with standard normal quantiles. Standard errors for sensitivity and specificity were calculated assuming a binomial distribution; for PPV and NPV a normal approximation was used; and for AUC the DeLong method was used. Performance was calculated for all samples with a matched biopsy, including the sub-cohort consisting of samples drawn at the same time as a protocol biopsy.",

An ANOVA Wald-test with Kenward\u2013Roger approximation for the degrees of freedom showed significance (p = 0.045). Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test was used to determine the difference among the three groups: none of the post-hoc tests demonstrated any association (Figure 6, Table S6). It is possible that the overall effect is driven by a sub-category of the non-rejection group (STA, BL, or OI) or the effect between the groups is smaller than detectable with the current sample size [30]."

                        "Two analyses were designed to evaluate the natural variability in dd-cfDNA over time in biopsy-matched, non-rejection patients. The first sub-analysis was a cross-sectional analysis of 60 plasma samples from 60 different patients, collected immediately following surgery (within three days (\u201cDay 0\u201d)) or at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months post-surgery. Among these STA patients, dd-cfDNA levels were lower at month 0 than subsequent time points; however, for most of these STA samples dd-cfDNA levels were <1% across all time points (Figure 7A). No association was observed between Day 0 samples and the other time points, although the overall distribution of dd-cfDNA levels in the Day 0 group appears lower in comparison (Figure 7A).",
                        "To evaluate the normal intra-patient variation in donor fraction, the second sub-analysis longitudinally assessed 10 individual patients across four time points (varying between about 1 month and 1 year post transplantation (minimum interval: 11 days, maximum interval: 345 days)). Overall, organ injury occurred at dd-cfDNA levels above 1% (Figure 7B). The inter-patient standard deviation within this cohort was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.0\u20130.37) and the intra-patient standard deviation was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32\u20130.56). The intraclass-correlation coefficient was low (0.1193), which suggests that the variability in these data are mostly due to intra-patient variation. Figure 7C depicts all available longitudinal data among patients that experienced a rejection. In 9/11 patients, dd-cfDNA levels were above 1% prior to rejection."

                "In this study, median dd-cfDNA was significantly higher in the AR group (2.32%) versus the non-rejection group (0.47%; p < 0.0001). Analysis of performance estimates demonstrated that the mmPCR-NGS method was able to discriminate active from non-rejection status with an AUC of 0.87 and high sensitivity (88.7%) and specificity (72.6%) at an AR cutoff of >1% dd-cfDNA. Based on a 25% prevalence of rejection, projected PPV and NPV were 52.0% and 95.1%, respectively. In contrast, eGFR scores were generally less discriminatory, with a 67.7% sensitivity and 65.3% specificity, and projected PPV and NPV of 39.4% and 85.9%, respectively. Therefore, if eGFR measurements were used as the sole clinical decision point, about 1 in 7 patients found to be at low risk of rejection would actually be experiencing rejection, and would not be referred for an indication biopsy\u2014this is in comparison to the projected NPV for dd-cfDNA that suggests that only 1 in 20 patients would miss an indication biopsy where it might be clinically necessary. Taken together, the superior performance of this SNP-based dd-cfDNA assay over that of the current standard of care for the evaluation of allograft rejection holds promise for enabling patients a greater opportunity for timely therapy in the case of an allograft injury.",
                "Levels of dd-cfDNA also provided discrimination of AR from the three non-rejection subgroups (STA, BL, and OI); median dd-cfDNA levels were significantly higher for samples with biopsy-proven AR (2.3%) versus BL (0.6%), OI (0.7%), and STA (0.4%). In a post hoc analysis, we examined the ability of dd-cfDNA combined with eGFR to predict rejection status (AR/non-rejection) in biopsy matched samples (Figure S1). This combined approach correctly classified 32/38 (84.2%) AR and 145/179 (81.0%) non-rejection samples, though in a head-to-head comparison it showed little to no improvement over dd-cfDNA alone. Combining dd-cfDNA with other markers may provide improved predictive value, but this was outside the scope of this study. Also of note, while both dd-cfDNA and eGFR can be used to differentiate AR and STA cases, the BL and OI samples stratify differently: they tend to aggregate with STA when using dd-cfDNA and with AR when using eGFR. This suggests that dd-cfDNA could be used together with eGFR to differentiate patients into three groups\u2014STA patients, AR patients, and patients experiencing BL or OI.",
                "In a recent study that amplified hundreds of target SNPs in dd-cfDNA to detect active rejection in kidney allografts, that method was able to discriminate AR from non-rejection with an AUC of 0.74, 59% sensitivity, and 85% specificity [14]. In comparison with that study, the novel dd-cfDNA test described in the current study showed a higher AUC value (0.87) as well as greater sensitivity (89%). On the other hand, specificity (73%) was slightly lower in the current study, partly driven by the fact that a majority of the \u201cfalse positives\u201d were cases with BL and OI indicating some form of organ injury. The predefined analysis in this study used 1% dd-cfDNA cutoff, based on prior experience [14]; however, as a different sensitivity/specificity tradeoff may be optimal in different use cases, performance was calculated, in a post hoc fashion, for additional cfDNA cutoffs: 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.6 % (Table S1).",
                "Another important finding of this study was that the fraction of dd-cfDNA did not differ between ABMR and TCMR groups, with dd-cfDNA levels of 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. These results are novel considering that a previously conducted study by Bloom et al. (2017), which used a different assay, found significantly higher dd-cfDNA levels for ABMR (2.9%) than for TCMR (\u22641.2%) [14], showing a lower ability to detect T-cell mediated rejections. Though the assay used in that study also measured dd-cfDNA, the methods used by the two assays differ greatly. It is unclear whether that test could not differentiate AR from non-rejection in cases of TCMR or if the result was due to the smaller sample size of that group in that study (n = 11). Regardless, it appears that dd-cfDNA measurements based on the mmPCR assay in this study can accurately discriminate AR from non-rejection across a range of pathologies, including both acute and chronic findings, in both the ABMR and TCMR groups. An additional finding in this study is that borderline, or early rejection injury, has a lower burden of dd-cfDNA than more established injury, making it possible to use this sensitive assay to track evolution of, or recovery from, AR.",
                "One barrier to widespread clinical use of dd-cfDNA as a diagnostic tool for monitoring organ transplant has been the limitations in measuring dd-cfDNA in certain cases, such as when the donor genotype is unknown or when the donor is a close relative. Given the design of the assay used here, it is possible to quantify dd-cfDNA without prior recipient or donor genotyping. Further, there is no need for a computational adjustment based on whether the donor is related to the recipient. In this study, evaluation of dd-cfDNA levels by donor type revealed that regardless of donor type (living related, living non-related, deceased non-related), dd-cfDNA levels were similar across all donor types within in the AR and non-rejection categories.",
                "A limitation of this study is that it was a retrospective analysis of archived samples from a single center. However, the central geographical area enabled all biopsies to be performed by a single pathologist, which may have helped minimize variability in biopsy classification; further, all experimenters were kept blinded during the process of data generation. The retrospective study design may have led to differences in patient characteristics across the rejection groups; for example, the STA group was enriched with younger patients who may be better suited immunologically to tolerate transplanted organs compared to older-aged patients. However, these age differences likely did not affect the validity of the study findings.",
                "A strength of this study is the large number of samples drawn at the time of a protocol biopsy. Performance of the assay among samples drawn at the time of a protocol biopsy are more reflective of expected performance during routine use of the assay, where there are no overt signs of injury; this is in contrast to for-cause biopsies, which are performed in a high-risk cohort where there are peripheral signs of organ injury. In this study, more than half (53%, 114/217) of the biopsy-matched samples were performed on protocol. The assay showed better performance in this cohort, with a sensitivity of 92.3%, specificity of 75.2%, and AUC of 0.89%. This data suggests that application of the dd-cfDNA assay in a clinical setting could potentially reduce the need for protocol biopsies.",
                "Another strength is the variety of patient samples in the non-rejection group, which comprised not only STA, but also BL and OI samples. This allowed for additional analyses in this study, which found that dd-cfDNA was significantly different in the AR group versus BL and OI groups. Additional sub-analyses by type of AR (ABMR and TCMR), as well as by donor type, demonstrated that dd-cfDNA levels were able to discriminate AR versus non-rejection in a variety of rejection and patient types. Further, the SNP-based mmPCR methodology underlying this assay has been extensively validated in the context of prenatal testing, and has been used to determine the DNA fraction of the minor constituent in a clinical setting in over a million maternal/fetal DNA samples. Finally, the inclusion of longitudinal data enabled a unique evaluation of the natural variability of dd-cfDNA in transplant patients over time. Inter-patient variability data demonstrated that between 0 and 12 months post-surgery, most patients with STA biopsies had dd-cfDNA levels below 1%, and most patients with a positive biopsy had a positive dd-cfDNA test at a time point prior to the positive biopsy. Taken together, this suggests that this mmPCR assay may be used for routine monitoring, to determine whether a renal transplant patient is experiencing organ injury that may require a change in management."
