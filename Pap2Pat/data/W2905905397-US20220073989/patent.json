By the methods, active rejection processes encompassing T-cell mediated rejection may be detected.

                        "Organ transplant procedures have saved countless lives. For example, there are currently approximately 190,000 living kidney recipients in the U.S. However, graft rejection is a serious problem and graft recipients must be monitored for rejection processes. Precision medicine and personalized tailoring of immunosuppressive drug regimens can improve the current state of organ transplant management. Transplantation injuries may be delayed in detection, and therefore treated ineffectively, because diagnosis can be difficult and biopsy, an invasive and potentially toxic procedure, may be inconclusive. Though advances in immunosuppressive drugs, organ procurement methods, and human leukocyte antigen-typing has lowered the number of clinical- and biopsy-confirmed rejection episodes, sub-clinical rejection of kidney grafts remains a significant risk. Kidney transplant management is particularly challenging owing to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the serum creatinine assay, which, in addition to the late detection of transplant injuries, makes immunosuppression dosage and adjustment far from personalized. Therefore, rapid and non-invasive detection and prediction of allograft injury/rejection holds promise for improving the post-transplantation management of patients who have received kidney allografts.",
                        "Diagnosis of renal transplant rejection is generally dependent on an increase in serum creatinine levels or its algorithmic derivative, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which indicates altered renal filtration functioning. Since there are many causes of the baseline drift in altered renal filtering in these patients, biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis. Methods of estimating kidney rejection in allograft recipients based on CR or eGFR lack sufficient accuracy. However, biopsies are invasive, morbid and, potentially, costly procedures, which limit their use in clinical practice. Furthermore, biopsy results are often plagued by expert reader variance and can lead to delayed diagnosis of active rejection, after which irreversible organ damage may have occurred. There is a current unmet need for a rapid, accurate, and noninvasive approach to detecting allograft rejection and/or injury-one which may require integration of the current \u201cgold\u201d standard morphological assessments with modern molecular diagnostic tools.",
                        "Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) detected in the blood of transplant recipients has been reported as a noninvasive marker to diagnose allograft injury/rejection, and holds promise for producing faster and more quantitative results compared with current diagnostic options. Recently, it was demonstrated that plasma dd-cfDNA fraction, typically between 0.3% and 1.2% in stable patients, can discriminate active rejection status from stable organ function in kidney transplant recipients, for example, as describe in Knight et al., Donor-specific Cell-Free DNA as a Biomarker in Solid Organ, Transplantation. A Systematic Review. Transplantation 2018 and in Bloom et al. Cell-Free DNA and Active Rejection in Kidney Allografts. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2017, 28, 2221-2232.",
                        "While dd-cfDNA provides a potential diagnostic tool for assessing active rejection, there is a need for improved methods of applying this measure for clinical uses, with higher sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, there remains a need in the art for diagnostic methods to detect other types of rejection injuries. These conditions include borderline rejection, a diagnosis characterized by certain characteristics of acute rejection, but considered to be less than acute rejection. Another category of sub-acute graft injury includes graft injuries due to factors such as drug toxicity or viral infection which do not arise to the level of active rejection. These subacute conditions have significant medical consequences and dictate different treatment options than acute rejection. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for methods of detecting subacute rejection processes in graft recipients. Likewise, there is also a need in the art for methods of treating subacute rejection processes, wherein effective treatment requires accurate detection of subacute rejection processes and the ability to distinguish between acute and subacute processes as they occur."

In a general implementation, the methods of the invention comprises the steps of\n\n\n- - obtaining a sample from a graft recipient;\n  - assaying the sample to determine dd-cfDNA abundance in the graft\n    recipient; and\n  - determining the rejection status of the graft by the measured\n    dd-cfDNA value and an established relationship between dd-cfDNA\n    values and graft rejection status.",

                        "Grafts and Recipients. The methods of the invention are applied for the determination of graft rejection status in a graft recipient. The graft may comprise any selected graft type, for example, a type selected from the group consisting of an organ, tissue, cells, kidney, heart, lung, liver, skin, cornea, intestine, pancreas, limb, digit, bone, ligament, cartilage, and tendon. References to a graft, as used herein will encompass whole organs and portions thereof. In a primary embodiment, the graft is a kidney graft, i.e. a whole or partial kidney.",

The transplant donor and transplant recipients may be humans, for example, in some embodiments the recipient may be a human patient in need of treatment for graft rejection. In alternative embodiments, the donor and recipient subjects may comprise non-human animals, for example veterinary patients or test animals. For convenience, the description provided herein will be directed to human subjects. In some embodiments, the donor is a relative of the recipient. In some embodiments, the genetic features of the donor are unknown.",
                        "Graft Rejection Status. Graft rejection status, as used herein, may fall within various categories. A first graft rejection status is \u201cstable.\u201d As used herein, a stable rejection status, or stable graft, indicates that the graft is healthy and functioning properly and that there is no substantial immune response against the graft.",
                        "A second graft rejection status is \u201cactive rejection.\u201d Active rejection, as used herein, means the graft is under substantial attack from the recipient's immune system and/or is undergoing, or is in danger of undergoing, impaired function, failure, necrosis, and other pathologies associated with rejection. Active rejection may encompass various rejection processes, including ABMR, TCMR, and mixed or simultaneous ABMR-TCMR processes, wherein some degree of ABMR and TCMR is occurring simultaneously. Active rejection typically requires augmentation of ongoing treatment or application of additional treatment to reverse the rejection and preserve the graft.",
                        "A third graft rejection status is \u201cSubacute Rejection.\u201d Subacute rejection, as used herein, indicates that the graft is undergoing injury, stress, or other pathological processes falling short of, or being different from, the pathologies of active rejection.",
                        "In one aspect, the graft type is kidney and the subacute rejection may comprise Borderline Rejection (BL). Borderline rejection may comprise symptoms of as determined by the Banff classification of renal allograft pathology, as known in the art. Borderline rejection may also comprise symptoms as determined under the Cooperative Clinical Trials in Transplantation (CCTT) classification system, as known in the art.",
                        "Subacute rejection may also encompass what will be referred to herein as \u201cOther Rejection\u201d (OR). OR encompasses any non-borderline impairment or injury of the graft short of or different from active rejection processes. OR may encompass immune-mediated injury, infection, or drug toxicity effects. In one embodiment, OR includes Early acute rejection without any clinical graft dysfunction-also called subclinical AR, which is often only picked up by protocol biopsy. In one embodiment, OR encompasses viral infection, for example, infection by a polyomavirus family member, for example, a BK virus or BKV.",
                        "Dd-cfDNA Analysis. The methods of the invention encompass the assessment of dd-cfDNA in a sample derived from a graft recipient. Donor-derived cell-free DNA, in the context of a graft recipient, is DNA derived from graft cells found in the graft recipient, for example, circulating in the blood of the recipient. Dd-cfDNA is produced by the death and lysis of cells within the graft. When the graft is under attack from the recipient's immune system or is undergoing other injury or dysfunction, the amount of circulating dd-cfDNA increases. Dd-cfDNA may be assessed in a sample derived from the recipient, for example, in serum obtained from a blood sample obtained from the recipient. The selected sample type may comprise any type, or mixture of types, of biological material wherein the dd-cfDNA derived from graft injury is present. Exemplary samples include blood, serum, tissue, including graft tissue, interstitial fluid, skin, oral swabs or any other biological material reflective of the dd-cfDNA.",
                        "Dd-cfDNA may be measured by any means known in the art for measurement of dd-cfDNA. For example, methods known in the art include those described in: T. M. Snyder, K. K. Khush, H. A. Valantine, S. R. Quake, Universal noninvasive detection of solid organ transplant rejection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 108, 6229-6234 (2011); Beck et al., Digital droplet PCR for rapid quantification of donor DNA in the circulation of transplant recipients as a potential universal biomarker of graft injury.

                        "In one embodiment, the dd-cfDNA assessment method is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based methodology. For example, an SNP-based massively multiplexed polymerase chain reaction assay may be used to detect the dd-cfDNA. Such methodologies may be used to determine the percentage of dd-cfDNA with greater precision than other known methodologies, and most advantageously, do not require prior knowledge of donor and recipient genotypes. These methods are also robust across related and unrelated donors. In these methods, samples are processed with PCR amplification of a selected set of SNPs, for example, thousands of SNPs, for example, over 10,000 SNPs. The PCR amplicons are sequenced and the results are analyzed with a probability model to estimate the percentage of dd-cfDNA in the subject.",
                        "Exemplary SNP-based models include methods such as those disclosed in: Dar et al., Clinical experience and follow-up with large scale single-nucleotide polymorphism-based noninvasive prenatal aneuploidy testing.

                        "Typically, dd-cfDNA values are expressed as a percentage, wherein the value refers to the percentage of donor-derived DNA of the total cell-free DNA in the sample.",
                        "Methods of Assessing Active Rejection. In a first aspect, the scope of the invention encompasses a novel method of identifying active rejection status in a graft recipient by means of dd-cfDNA, wherein the active rejection status encompasses ABMR, TCMR, and ABMR and/or TCMR processes. Previously published methods of identifying active rejection in transplant recipients by means of dd-cfDNA were unable to resolve TCMR subjects from stable subjects, teaching an inability of dd-cfDNA detect TCMR. However, the inventors of the present disclosure have determined that the occurrence of active rejection comprising TCMR may be assessed by dd-cfDNA, as disclosed herein.",
                        "In another aspect, the scope of the invention encompasses method of detecting the occurrence of active rejection in a subject by dd-cfDNA wherein the threshold values of dd-cfDNA for the determination of active rejection may be substantially higher than in prior diagnostic methods. In previously reported methods, dd-cfDNA thresholds of 1% (i.e., dd-cfDNA of 1% or greater), sometimes as high as 1.2%, have been used as an indicator of active rejection processes for various graft types, including kidney. However, by the novel dd-cfDNA analysis methods and sample pools utilized by the inventors of the present disclosure, alternative thresholds for determination of active rejection are provided. The inventors of the present disclosure have determined that dd-cfDNA is higher in subjects undergoing active graft rejection than previously understood in the art. For example, as disclosed herein, the mean dd-cfDNA was discovered to be greater than 2% for all forms of active rejection, including: ABMR (2.2%), TCMR (2.7%), and mixed ABMR/TCMR subjects (2.6%). Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention encompasses a method of identifying subjects with active rejection comprising ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR processes by measurements of dd-cfDNA greater than previously established thresholds, e.g. 1%.",
                        "Advantageously, the higher thresholds identified herein provide greater sensitivity and specificity in the detection of active rejection. This is especially valuable for the prevention of overtreatment. By the novel disclosures herein, higher thresholds are identified that reduce the risk of unnecessary interventions, which may be invasive, traumatic, or costly. For example, as demonstrated herein, specificity and sensitivity in the detection of active in kidney subjects, can be optimized at a dd-cfDNA threshold of about 1.5% (e.g., in the range of 1.4-1.6).",
                        "In one implementation, the scope of the invention encompasses a method of detecting the occurrence of active rejection process in a graft recipient, the methods comprising the steps of\n\n\n- - obtaining a sample from a graft recipient;\n  - measuring the abundance of dd-cfDNA in the sample; and\n  - determining if an active rejection process is occurring in the graft\n    recipient, wherein if the measured dd-cfDNA abundance meets or\n    exceeds a selected AR threshold value, active rejection process is\n    determined to be occurring in the graft recipient and if the value\n    of the measured dd-cfDNA is less than the selected threshold value,\n    it is indicative that the graft recipient is not experiencing\n    ongoing active rejection processes.",
                        "In certain embodiments: the sample is blood; the graft recipient is a human; the subject is a kidney recipient; and/or the active rejection process is any of ABMR, TCMR, and/or mixed ABMR-TCMR. In various embodiments, the selected threshold AR value is between 1.0 and 2.5%, for example, a threshold dd-cfDNA value selected from the group consisting of 1.0%, 1.05%, 1.1%, 1.15%, 1.2%, 1.25%, 1.3%, 1.35%, 1.4%, 1.45%, 1.5%, 1.55%, 1.6%, 1.65%, 1.7%, 1.75% 1.8%, 1.85%, 1.9%, 1.95%, 2.0%, 2.05%, 2.1%, 2.15%, 2.2%, 2.25%, 2.3%, 2.35%, 2.4%, 2.45% or 2.5%.",
                        "In certain embodiments, the scope of the invention encompasses the performance of additional diagnostic and/or treatment steps following assessment of graft rejection status by dd-cfDNA. In one implementation, if the subject is determined to have the occurrence of active rejection, the method comprises the additional step of performing diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis of active rejection and/or determine the form or subtype of active rejection. For example, the additional step may be the performance of one or more diagnostic tests to determine if the detected active rejection is ABMR, TCMR, or mixed ABMR/TCMR. In one embodiment, the one or more diagnostic tests is performed by obtaining an additional sample from the graft recipient. In one embodiment, the one or more diagnostic tests is performed on the previously obtained sample utilized to determine active rejection type. In one embodiment, the one or more diagnostic tests comprises a histological analysis performed on a biopsy.",
                        "Exemplary histological indicators of ABMR include, for example, microvascular inflammation; peritubular/glomerular basement membrane changes; positive antibody staining for C4d, and the presence of glomerulonephritis, the presence of circulating donor specific antibodies. Exemplary histological indicators of TCMR include, for example, the presence of tubulo-interstitial immune infiltrates; microvascular inflammation; peritubular capillaritis, and glomerulitis. In one embodiment, the one or more diagnostic tests comprises a molecular analysis, for example, a test which assesses the presence of a biomarkers for ABMR or TCMR, for example, a metabolite or the expression of indicator genes. In one embodiment, the one or more additional tests measures the expression of genes indicative of AR or AR subtypes, for example, as described in Sigdel et al., Assessment of 19 Genes and Validation of CRM Gene Panel for Quantitative Transcriptional Analysis of Molecular Rejection and Inflammation in Archival Kidney Transplant Biopsies, Front. Med., 1 Oct. 2019, https://doi.org/10.3389/fined.2019.00213. For example, a significant increase in the expression of INPP5D, ISG20, NKG7, RUNX3, CD31, CD4, CD68, and COL4A is associated with ABMR. A significant increase in the expression of BASP1, CXCL10, CXCL9, INPP5D, ISG20, LCK, RUNX3, CD6, CD4, COL4A is associated with TCMR.",
                        "In some implementations, the scope of the invention encompasses a method of treating active rejection in a subject. The method of treating active rejection encompasses the detection of active rejection, as described herein, followed by performance of one or more diagnostic tests to determine which form of active rejection is occurring. Upon determination of the form of active rejection that is occurring, one or more appropriate treatments may be selected and administered to the transplant recipient. For example, In one embodiment, if the risk of TCMR is found to be elevated, treatments appropriate for mitigating TCMR are administered, such as the use of corticosteroids and T cell-depleting agents. In one embodiment, if the risk of ABMR is elevated, treatments appropriate for treating ABMR are applied, for example, plasmapheresis, administration of intravenous immune globulin, and B cell depletion.",
                        "Detection of Subacute Rejection. The scope of the invention further encompasses methods of detecting the occurrence of subacute rejection. The methods is based on the novel discovery that the occurrence of Subacute Rejection processes may be determined by assessment of dd-cfDNA. Measured dd-cfDNA values falling within certain ranges will be indicative of ongoing subacute rejection processes. Overall, the occurrence of subacute rejection processes is shown herein to be associated with dd-cfDNA levels intermediate between those observed in stable subjects and those observed in subjects undergoing active rejection. The discovery of an intermediate dd-cfDNA range associated with subacute rejection provides the art with a novel means of diagnosing this category of graft injuries.",

Where applicable, all tests were two sided. Significance was set at p<0.05. Because the distribution of dd-cfDNA in patients was severely skewed among the groups, data were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test followed by Dunn multiple comparison tests with Holm correction eGFR (creatinine in mg/dL) was calculated as known in the art, briefly, eGFR=186\u00d7Serum Creatinine\u2212154\u00d7Age\u22120.203\u00d7(1.210 if Black)\u00d7(0.742 if Female). To evaluate the performance of dd-cfDNA and eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) as rejection markers, samples were separated into an AR group and a non-rejection group (BL+STA+OI). Using this categorization, the following predetermined cut-offs were used to classify as sample as AR: >1% for dd-cfDNA and <60.0% for eGFR. To calculate the performance parameters of each marker (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and area under the curve (AUC)), a bootstrap method was used to account for repeated measurements within a patient. Briefly, at each bootstrap step, a single sample was selected from each patient; by assuming independence among patients, the performance parameters and their standard errors were calculated. This was repeated 10,000 times; final confidence intervals were calculated using the bootstrap mean for the parameter with the average of the bootstrap standard errors with standard normal quantiles. Standard errors for sensitivity and specificity were calculated assuming a binomial distribution; for PPV and NPV a normal approximation was used; and for AUC the DeLong method was used. Performance was calculated for all samples with a matched biopsy, and for the sub-cohort consisting of samples drawn at the same time as a protocol biopsy. Differences in dd-cfDNA levels by donor type (living related, living non-related, and deceased non-related) were also evaluated. Significance was determined using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test as described above. Inter- and intra-variability in dd-cfDNA over time was evaluated using a mixed effects model with a logarithmic transformation on dd-cfDNA; 95% confidence intervals for the intra- and inter-patient standard deviations were calculated using a likelihood profile method. Post hoc analyses evaluated (a) different dd-cfDNA thresholds to maximize NPV and (b) combined dd-cfDNA and eGFR to define an empirical rejection zone that may improve the PPV for AR diagnosis.",

Meanwhile at an equivalent specificity of 81.0%, (using a cut off of 1.3% dd-cfDNA) the sensitivity of the dd-cfDNA marker alone was 82.3%.

Of the 38 samples with biopsy-proven AR, 16 were classified as either antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) or ABMR and borderline T-cell-mediated rejection (bTCMR); 12 had a combination of both ABMR and TCMR; 10 were classified as either TCMR or TCMR and bABMR. In addition, 13 and 59 BL samples were classified as bAMBR and bTCMR, respectively. FIG. 4 shows the relationship between dd-cfDNA level and type of rejection. Median dd-cfDNA did not differ significantly between AMBR (2.2%), ABMR/TCMR (2.6%), or TCMR (2.7%) groups (p=0.855) (Table S4). The study contained a range of pathologies, and the data indicate that this assay, unlike other published studies measuring cfDNA by other assays, is robust to different rejection types.",

To assess the relationship between dd-cfDNA and donor type (living related, living non-related, and deceased non-related) a linear mixed-effects model was constructed using a log transformed dd-cfDNA as the response and donor type as the predictor for the non-rejection group. The log-transformation was applied to satisfy the model's assumptions. The test was limited to the non-rejection group due to the limited number of AR samples in two groups (living related and living non-related). An ANOVA Wald-test with Kenward-Roger approximation for the degrees of freedom showed significance (p=0.045). Tukey's post-hoc test was used to determine the difference among the three groups: none of the post-hoc tests demonstrated any association.",
                                "dd-cfDNA Variability over Time. Two analyses were designed to evaluate the natural variability in dd-cfDNA over time in biopsy-matched, non-rejection patients. The first sub-analysis was a cross-sectional analysis of 60 plasma samples from 60 different patients, collected immediately following surgery (within three days (\u201c0 months\u201d)) or at 1, 3, 6, or 12 months post-surgery. Among these STA patients, dd-cfDNA levels were lower at month 0 than subsequent time points; however, for most of these STA samples dd-cfDNA levels were <1% across all time points. No association was observed between Day 0 samples and the other time points, although the overall distribution of dd-cfDNA levels in the Day 0 group appears lower in comparison. Overall, organ injury occurred at dd-cfDNA levels above 1%. The inter-patient standard deviation within this cohort was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.0-0.37) and the intra-patient standard deviation was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32-0.56). The intraclass-correlation coefficient was low (0.1193), which suggests that the variability in these data are mostly due to intra-patient variation.",
                                "Discussion. In this study, median dd-cfDNA was significantly higher in the AR group (2.32%) versus the non-rejection group (0.47%; p<0.0001). Analysis of performance estimates demonstrated that the mmPCR-NGS method was able to discriminate active from non-rejection status with an AUC of 0.87 and high sensitivity (88.7%) and specificity (72.6%) at the AR cutoff of >1% dd-cfDNA. Based on a 25% prevalence of rejection, projected PPV and NPV were 52.0% and 95.1%, respectively. In contrast, eGFR scores were generally less discriminatory, with a 67.7% sensitivity and 65.3% specificity, and projected PPV and NPV of 39.4% and 85.9%, respectively. Therefore, if eGFR measurements were used as the sole clinical decision point, about 1 in 7 patients found to be at low risk of rejection would actually be experiencing rejection, and would not be referred for an indication biopsy\u2014this is in comparison to the projected NPV for dd-cfDNA that suggests that only 1 in 20 patients would miss an indication biopsy where it might be clinically necessary. Taken together, the superior performance of this SNP-based dd-cfDNA assay over that of the current standard of care for the evaluation of allograft rejection enables patients a greater opportunity for timely therapy in the case of an allograft injury.",
                                "levels of dd-cfDNA also provided discrimination of AR from the three non-rejection subgroups (STA, BL, and OI); median dd-cfDNA levels were significantly higher for samples with biopsy-proven AR (2.3%) versus BL (0.6%), OI (0.7%), and STA (0.4%). In a post hoc analysis, the ability of dd-cfDNA combined with eGFR to predict rejection status (AR/non-rejection) in biopsy matched samples was examine. This combined approach correctly classified 32/38 (84.2%) AR and 145/179 (81.0%) non-rejection samples, though in a head-to-head comparison it showed little to no improvement over dd-cfDNA alone. Also of note, while both dd-cfDNA and eGFR can be used to differentiate AR and STA cases, the BL and OI samples stratify differently: they tend to aggregate with STA when using dd-cfDNA and with AR when using eGFR. This demonstrates that dd-cfDNA can be interpreted together with eGFR to differentiate patients into three groups-STA patients, AR patients, and patients experiencing BL or OI.",
                                "Another important finding of this study was that the fraction of dd-cfDNA did not differ between ABMR and TCMR groups, with dd-cfDNA levels of 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. These results are novel considering that the previously conducted study by Bloom et al. (2017), which used a different assay, found significantly higher dd-cfDNA levels for ABMR (2.9%) than for TCMR (51.2%), showing a lower ability to detect T-cell mediated rejections. Though the assay used in that study also measured dd-cfDNA, the methods used by the two assays differ greatly. The dd-cfDNA measurements based on the mmPCR assay in the results disclosed herein can accurately discriminate AR from non-rejection across a range of pathologies, including both acute and chronic findings, in both the ABMR and TCMR groups. An additional finding in this study is that borderline, or early rejection injury, has a lower burden of dd-cfDNA than more established injury, making it possible to use the methods of the invention to track evolution of, or recovery from, active rejection.",
                                "One barrier to widespread clinical use of dd-cfDNA as a diagnostic tool for monitoring organ transplant has been the limitations in measuring dd-cfDNA in certain cases, such as when the donor genotype is unknown or when the donor is a close relative. In the methods disclosed herein, advantageously, it is possible to quantify dd-cfDNA without prior recipient or donor genotyping. Further, there is no need for a computational adjustment based on whether the donor is related to the recipient. In the methods disclosed herein, evaluation of dd-cfDNA levels by donor type revealed that regardless of donor type (living related, living non-related, deceased non-related), dd-cfDNA levels were similar across all donor types within in the AR and non-rejection categories.",

This rapid, accurate, and noninvasive technology allows for detection of significant renal injury in patients better than the current standard of care, with the potential for better patient management, more targeted biopsies, and improved renal allograft function and survival.",
