- outline methods of assessing active rejection using dd-cfDNA
- define embodiments of the invention
- describe diagnostic tests for active rejection
- outline treatment methods for active rejection
- describe detection of subacute rejection
- outline diagnostic tests for subacute rejection
- describe treatment methods for subacute rejection
- combine dd-cfDNA measurements with kidney function measures
- apply methods to various transplant recipients and scenarios

### Exemplary Embodiments

- outline dd-cfDNA measurement in blood samples
- detail statistical analyses of dd-cfDNA and eGFR
- present results of dd-cfDNA and eGFR in kidney transplant recipients
- evaluate performance estimates for discriminatory ability of tests
- analyze dd-cfDNA performance in unique biopsy-confirmed subgroups
- examine relationship between dd-cfDNA and rejection type
- investigate dd-cfDNA levels by donor type and variability over time
- discuss results and implications for kidney transplant monitoring
