    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Chemical biology strategies for directly perturbing protein homeostasis including the degradation tag (dTAG) system provide temporal advantages over genetic approaches and improved selectivity over small molecule inhibitors. We describe dTAG V -1, an exclusively selective VHL-recruiting dTAG molecule, to rapidly degrade FKBP12 F36V -tagged proteins. dTAG V -1 overcomes a limitation of previously reported CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecules to degrade recalcitrant oncogenes, supports combination degrader studies and facilitates investigations of protein function in cells and mice.",

                "Modulating protein abundance with small molecule degraders is a powerful approach for investigating functional consequences of rapid and direct protein loss, without alteration of corresponding mRNA levels. Degraders including heterobifunctional degraders (also known as PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras or PROTACs) and nonchimeric molecular glues, co-opt an E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce rapid and reversible proteasome-mediated degradation1. Achieving immediate target protein loss with degraders provides a crucial advantage over genetic knockout or knockdown approaches, which require a significant delay to achieve an impactful protein reduction2. However, degrader development is hindered by a reliance on target-specific chemical matter, which is unavailable for the majority of the proteome. To address this challenge, several strategies aimed at the direct control of cellular protein levels have been recently developed, including methods that use small molecules3\u20139, nanobodies10, or antibodies11.",
                "We previously described a versatile approach known as the degradation tag (dTAG) system to rapidly deplete any tagged target protein in cells and in mice6. The dTAG system is a dual component platform requiring the expression of FKBP12F36V in-frame with a gene-of-interest and treatment with a heterobifunctional dTAG molecule (dTAG-13)12 that engages FKBP12F36V and cereblon (CRBN), an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a, b). This interaction leads to exclusive degradation of the FKBP12F36V-tagged protein. Studies degrading diverse targets including oncoproteins, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and kinases illustrate the utility of the dTAG system for drug target validation and discovery6,12\u201323. Despite this broad applicability, we observed context-specific and protein-specific differences in the effectiveness of dTAG-13 for inducing target protein degradation.",
                "Here, we report the synthesis, characterization and utility of a second generation, in vivo-compatible dTAG molecule that recruits the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase complex, dTAGV-1 (Fig.\u00a01a, b). We demonstrate that dTAGV-1 degrades fusion proteins recalcitrant to CRBN-mediated degradation, exemplified by EWS/FLI, a driver of Ewing sarcoma. Collectively, this study describes an important extension to the dTAG platform, towards a universally applicable strategy for direct protein control.Fig. 1dTAGV-1 is an exclusively selective degrader of FKBP12F36V-tagged proteins.a Schematic depiction of the dTAG system using VHL-recruiting dTAG molecules.

                        "To identify a VHL-recruiting dTAG molecule, we synthesized ortho-AP1867-conjugated analogs with varying VHL-binding ligands and linker composition and screened for cellular activity in 293FT FKBP12WT-Nluc and FKBP12F36V-Nluc dual luciferase systems6 (Fig.\u00a01b, c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c, d), culminating in the identification of dTAGV-1 (Fig.\u00a01b). Full structure activity relationships of our complete CRBN-recruiting and VHL-recruiting dTAG molecule series will be disclosed in a separate manuscript. dTAGV-1 induced potent degradation of FKBP12F36V-Nluc with no effects on FKBP12WT-Nluc, demonstrating that dTAGV-1 is an FKBP12F36V-selective degrader (Fig.\u00a01c). dTAGV-1-NEG, a diastereomer of dTAGV-1 that can no longer bind and recruit VHL24 and functions as a heterobifunctional negative control, had no activity on FKBP12F36V-Nluc or FKBP12WT-Nluc (Fig.\u00a01b, c). These effects were recapitulated in PATU-8902 LACZ-FKBP12F36V cells15, corroborating effective degradation of FKBP12F36V-fusions in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) context (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e). In both assays, levels of FKBP12F36V-fusion degradation with dTAGV-1 were comparable to dTAG-13 and dTAG-476,12,16, two CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecules (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b\u2013e). Use of dTAGV-1-NEG abrogated these effects comparably to the matched heterobifunctional negative control compounds that cannot bind and recruit CRBN25,26 (dTAG-13-NEG and dTAG-47-NEG) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b\u2013e). Multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics demonstrated that LACZ-FKBP12F36V was the only significantly degraded protein in the proteome (fold change < \u22122.0, P value < 0.001, FDR q\u2009<\u20090.05) upon treatment of PATU-8902 LACZ-FKBP12F36V cells with 500\u2009nM dTAGV-1, confirming the exquisite selectivity of the dTAG system (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplementary Data\u00a01, 2). No significant changes in protein levels of VHL or VHL-regulated targets were observed upon dTAGV-1 treatment, and no significantly degraded targets were observed with dTAGV-1-NEG (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Data\u00a01, 2).",
                        "We next evaluated the utility of dTAGV-1 for combinatorial degrader studies through co-treatment experiments with THAL-SNS-032, a previously reported CRBN-recruiting CDK9 degrader27. dTAGV-1 alone did not alter CDK9 protein levels (Fig.\u00a01e, lane 7), which was confirmed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis (Supplementary Data\u00a02). dTAGV-1 effectively combined with THAL-SNS-032 and co-treatment led to pronounced degradation of both LACZ-FKBP12F36V and CDK9 at levels comparable to those with treatment of each degrader alone (Fig.\u00a01e, lanes 8\u201312), avoiding potential substrate competition effects28. To confirm the utility of dTAGV-1 for target-specific validation studies, we evaluated KRASG12V degradation, an oncogenic driver of PDAC, in PATU-8902 FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V; KRAS\u2212/\u2212 cells15. dTAGV-1 treatment led to rapid KRASG12V degradation, which was not induced by dTAGV-1-NEG treatment (Fig.\u00a02a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). KRASG12V degradation was rescued by pre-treatment with proteasome-inhibitor carfilzomib or Nedd8 activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924, and by VHL knockout, consistent with the mechanism-of-action of a VHL-recruiting degrader (Fig.\u00a02b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). We also observed the expected collapse in cellular signaling and diminished cell proliferation in 2D-monolayer and 3D-spheroid cultures upon FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V degradation with dTAGV-1 treatment, to levels comparable to CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecules (Fig.\u00a02c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c\u2013e).Fig. 2dTAGV-1 is an in vivo-compatible degrader of FKBP12F36V-tagged proteins.a Immunoblot analysis of PATU-8902 FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V; KRAS\u2212/\u2212 clone treated with DMSO, dTAGV-1, or dTAGV-1-NEG for the indicated time-course. b Immunoblot analysis of 293TWT FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V or 293TVHL-/- FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V cells treated with DMSO or the indicated dTAG molecules for 24\u2009h.

                        "To confirm the in vivo applicability of dTAGV-1, we characterized the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of dTAGV-1 in mice. dTAGV-1 demonstrated improved properties compared to dTAG-13, with a longer half-life (T1/2\u2009=\u20094.43, 2.41\u2009h respectively) and greater exposure (AUCinf\u2009=\u200918,517, 6140\u2009h\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121, respectively) by intraperitoneal administration at 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 (Supplementary Table\u00a01). To report on the PD profile of dTAG molecules, we employed MV4;11 luciferase-FKBP12F36V (luc-FKBP12F36V) cells that allow noninvasive monitoring of bioluminescent signal upon dTAG molecule administration in mice6. Following tail vein injection of MV4;11 luc-FKBP12F36V cells and establishment of leukemic burden, we performed daily bioluminescent measurements 4\u2009h after vehicle, 35\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 dTAG-13 or 35\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 dTAGV-1 administration. Striking loss of bioluminescent signal was achieved 4\u2009h after the first administration of dTAGV-1 (Fig.\u00a02d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). Consistent loss of bioluminescent signal was observed 4\u2009h after each of the three dTAG-13 or dTAGV-1 administrations. Compared to dTAG-13, improved duration of degradation was also observed with dTAGV-1, with degradation evident 28\u2009h after the final administration. These results support the use of dTAGV-1 as a potent and selective molecule to evaluate target-specific degradation in vitro and in vivo."

                        "There is long-standing interest in the oncology community in identifying targetable dependencies in Ewing sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma is driven by the translocation of EWSR1 and members of the ETS transcription factors, most commonly FLI, giving rise to a fusion transcription factor oncoprotein that activates an aberrant transcriptional program29. Currently, there are a shortage of model systems and direct-acting agents that allow modulation of EWS/FLI levels or activity with precise kinetic control. To evaluate the effects of EWS/FLI degradation in Ewing sarcoma, we selected EWS502 cells, which are highly dependent on EWS/FLI for proliferation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). Through simultaneous expression of FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI and Cas9/sgFLI, we developed FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI; EWS/FLI\u2212/\u2212 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). FKBP12F36V-GFP was expressed in EWS502 cells as a control and was effectively degraded upon treatment with dTAG-13 and dTAGV-1, indicating the ability to co-opt both CRBN and VHL for targeted degradation in this cell line (Fig.\u00a03a, b). The characteristic \u201chook effect\u201d behavior30, which is commonly observed with heterobifunctional degraders6, was also evident at high doses (5000\u2009nM) of dTAG molecule treatment due to saturation of FKBP12F36V and E3 ubiquitin ligase binding sites. However, FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI was only susceptible to degradation upon treatment with dTAGV-1 in EWS502 cells, which was evident within 1\u2009h of treatment, highlighting the necessity of comparative evaluation of both CRBN-recruiting and VHL-recruiting dTAG molecules (Fig.\u00a03a, b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c). To confirm FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI degradation and identify immediate downstream EWS/FLI targets, we performed acute quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and observed pronounced loss of FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI upon dTAGV-1 treatment (Fig.\u00a03c and Supplementary Data\u00a01, 2). dTAGV-1 led to a decrease in downstream EWS/FLI targets such as NKX2-2, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of the differentially regulated target proteins (FDR\u2009<\u20090.05) identified known EWS/FLI and Ewing sarcoma signatures (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). Potent antiproliferative effects were also observed upon EWS/FLI degradation at longer time-points, which were absent with dTAGV-1-NEG treatment and in FKBP12F36V-GFP cell lines (Fig.\u00a03f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d).Fig. 3EWS/FLI degradation reverses abnormal proteomic signaling and proliferation.a, b Immunoblot analysis of EWS502 FKBP12F36V-GFP or FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI; EWS/FLI\u2212/\u2212 cells treated with DMSO (a, b), dTAG-13 (a), or dTAGV-1 (b) for 24\u2009h.

                        "To evaluate the dependence of VHL-recruiting dTAG molecule activity on linker length and composition, we synthesized and evaluated dTAG-63, an analog of dTAGV-1. dTAG-63 is composed of a polyethylene glycol linker, (PEG)3, rather than an all carbon linker, between the FKBP12F36V and E3 ubiquitin ligase binders (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a), and is a matched molecular pair to our previously disclosed first-generation CRBN-recruiting compound, dTAG-76,12. Treatment of FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI; EWS/FLI\u2212/\u2212 cells with dTAG-63 led to marginal degradation of FKBP12F36V-EWS/FLI, limited changes in NKX2-2 protein levels and modest antiproliferative effects relative to dTAGV-1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b, c). Similar trends in antiproliferation upon FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V degradation were observed upon treatment of PATU-8902 FKBP12F36V-KRASG12V; KRAS\u2212/\u2212 cells with dTAG-63\u00a0(Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d). These results are consistent with our prior observation that dTAG-7 is less effective across multiple cell lineages than dTAG-13, a CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecule with an all carbon linker6.",
                        "Finally, while we observed pronounced antiproliferative activity upon degradation of EWS/FLI with dTAGV-1, our data indicates that combination approaches may be necessary to achieve complete loss of viability. Prior work indicates that BET bromodomain inhibitors and degraders may have applications in Ewing Sarcoma31. To investigate potential synergy between direct and indirect repression of the EWS/FLI transcriptional program, we evaluated degradation of EWS/FLI in combination with BET bromodomain degradation. We observed that dBET6, a CRBN-recruiting, pan-BET bromodomain degrader32, synergized strongly with VHL-mediated EWS/FLI degradation (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a\u2013c). Together, this data exemplifies the utility of VHL-recruiting dTAG molecules and provides model systems to evaluate the acute and prolonged consequences of EWS/FLI loss."

Through evaluation of mutant KRAS degradation in PDAC models, we show that either CRBN or VHL can be co-opted to alleviate the aberrant signaling coordinated by this oncoprotein. By contrast, we observed contextual differences in the ability of these E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes to degrade EWS/FLI. This is consistent with our recent report demonstrating effective degradation of a core mediator subunit (MED14) with dTAGV-1 in HCT116 cells, a context in which CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecules were not effective22. We observed that rapid MED14 degradation abrogated lineage-specifying transcriptional circuits. Together, our studies provide support for use of dTAGV-1 to overcome the current limitations of the dTAG system, enabling evaluation of the direct effects of fusion proteins recalcitrant to CRBN-recruiting dTAG molecules.",

This data supports that targeting EWS/FLI for degradation with direct-acting heterobifunctional degraders or molecular glues may be a tractable strategy and identifies potential combination strategies with BET bromodomain degraders. Together, the suite of dTAG molecules and paired controls provided in this study will facilitate evaluation of the functional consequences of precise posttranslational protein removal for an expanded target pool. The dTAG system enables rapid modulation of protein abundance and serves as a versatile strategy to determine whether targeted degradation is a promising drug development approach for a given target in vitro and in vivo."
