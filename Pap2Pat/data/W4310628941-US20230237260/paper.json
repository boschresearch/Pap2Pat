    "title": "SPADE: Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection under Distribution Mismatch",
    "date": "2022-11-30",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection is a common problem, as often the datasets containing anomalies are partially labeled. We propose a canonical framework: Semi-supervised Pseudo-labeler Anomaly Detection with Ensembling (SPADE) that isn't limited by the assumption that labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. Indeed, the assumption is often violated in many applications - for example, the labeled data may contain only anomalies unlike unlabeled data, or unlabeled data may contain different types of anomalies, or labeled data may contain only 'easy-to-label' samples. SPADE utilizes an ensemble of one class classifiers as the pseudo-labeler to improve the robustness of pseudo-labeling with distribution mismatch. Partial matching is proposed to automatically select the critical hyper-parameters for pseudo-labeling without validation data, which is crucial with limited labeled data. SPADE shows state-of-the-art semi-supervised anomaly detection performance across a wide range of scenarios with distribution mismatch in both tabular and image domains. In some common real-world settings such as model facing new types of unlabeled anomalies, SPADE outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives by 5% AUC in average.",

                "Anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications, including identification of manufacturing defects, network security threats, and financial fraud (Chalapathy & Chawla, 2019;Ahmed et al., 2016;Vanerio & Casas, 2017). Anomaly detection can be considered in different settings. One is the fully-supervised setting, where the labels for all samples are available, for both normal and anomalous samples (Chawla et al., 2002;Estabrooks et al., 2004;Hwang et al., 2011;Barua et al., 2012). This setting is typically addressed with specialized approaches for data imbalance, e.g. weighted loss functions or resampling methods. An important special case of this fully-supervised setting is when only labeled normal samples exist (Sch\u00f6lkopf et (Sch\u00f6lkopf et al., 1999) or auto-encoder (Ruff et al., 2018)) and Isolation Forest (Liu et al., 2008) are popular approaches. Despite being widely-studied, the challenge towards the real-world use for these supervised settings is their tedious labeling requirement. At the other extreme, there is the fully unsupervised anomaly detection setting where no labeled data is available (Breunig et al., 2000;Liu et al., 2008;Zong et al., 2018;Bergman & Hoshen, 2019;Yoon et al., 2022). While the labeling costs can be entirely eliminated for this setting, the performance degradation is often significant compared to the supervised setting (Bergman & Hoshen, 2019;Zong et al., 2018), limiting its applicability for deployment.",
                "To achieve the best of both worlds, we focus on the semi-supervised anomaly detection setting, aiming to achieve high performance with a limited labeling budget. In previous works on semi-supervised anomaly detection (Zhang & Zuo, 2008;Bekker & Davis, 2020;Blanchard et al., 2010;Akcay et al., 2018;G\u00f6rnitz et al., 2013;Ruff et al., 2020), some focus on the positive-unlabeled setting (Zhang & Zuo, 2008;Bekker & Davis, 2020), and others utilize one-class classifiers or adversarial training on semi-supervised learning (G\u00f6rnitz et al., 2013;Akcay et al., 2018). Ruff et al. (2020) treats all unlabeled data as normal samples to construct an anomaly detector in semi-supervised settings. In addition, any semi-supervised learning method (even when they aren't developed for anomaly detection) can be adapted to the semi-supervised anomaly detection setting (Sohn et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020a;Grill et al., 2020).",
                "Most semi-supervised learning methods assume that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distributions (Sohn et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020a;Grill et al., 2020). In other words, the subsets of the data are labeled such that sampling from the unlabeled data is randomly uniform. However, in practice, this assumption often does not hold: distribution mismatch commonly occur, with labeled and unlabeled data coming from different distributions. Some works (Kim et al., 2020) tackle this in a limited setting where only the label distributions are different (e.g., the anomalous ratio is 10% for training but 50% for testing), however, there are other more general real-world scenarios, as exemplified in Fig. 1. First, positive and unlabeled (PU) or negative and unlabeled (NU) settings are common, where the distributions between labeled (either positive or negative) and unlabeled (both positive and negative) samples are different (see Fig. 1(Left)) (Zhang & Zuo, 2008;Bekker & Davis, 2020). Second, additional unlabeled data can be gathered after labeling, causing distribution shift. For example, manufacturing processes may keep evolving and thus, the corresponding defects can change and the defect types at labeling differ from the defect types in unlabeled data (see Fig. 1(Middle)). In addition, for financial fraud detection and anti-money laundering applications, new anomalies can appear after the data labeling process, as the criminals adapt themselves. Lastly, human labelers are more confident on easy samples; thus, easy samples are more likely to be included in the labeled data and difficult samples are more likely to be included in the unlabeled data (see Fig. 1(Right)). For example, with some crowd-sourcing-based labeling tools, only the samples with some consensus on the labels (as a measure of confidence) are included in the labeled set.",
                "As we experimentally demonstrate (in Sec. 5), standard semi-supervised learning methods (Sohn et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2020a;Grill et al., 2020) are sub-optimal for anomaly detection under distribution mismatch, because they are developed with the assumption that labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. Generated pseudo-labels are highly dependent on a small set of labeled data; thus, the trained semi-supervised models would be biased on the labeled data distribution. Transfer learning methods or the frameworks for distribution shifts may constitute alternatives (Pan & Yang, 2009; Yu et al., 2020;Raina et al., 2007) by treating source/target data as labeled/unlabeled data. However, these have not been effective with a small number of source (labeled) samples (as shown in Sec. 5).",
                "In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection framework SPADE, that yields strong and robust performance even under distribution mismatch. Contributions of this paper can be summarized as below:",
                "\u2022 Motivated by the common real-world scenarios, we tackle the distribution mismatch problem for semisupervised anomaly detection which is critical but under-explored. \u2022 We propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework, SPADE. Carefully-designed components of SPADE enable robust semi-supervised learning. As such, SPADE introduces a pseudo-labeling mechanism using an ensemble of OCCs and a judicious way of combining supervised and self-supervised learning.  \u2022 SPADE reduces the dependence on the labeled data as the predictors are trained with a small number of labeled and pseudo-labeled samples. \u2022 We propose a novel approach using a partial matching method (Du Plessis & Sugiyama, 2014) to pick hyperparameters without a validation set. This innovation is critical as conventional hyperparameter selection relies on validation set, which is often unavailable in real world with limited labeled data. \u2022 We show state-of-the-art semi-supervised anomaly detection performance of SPADE in multiple settings that represent common real-world scenarios. AUC improvements of SPADE can be up to 10.6% on tabular data and 3.6% on image data. \u2022 We focus on an important real-world machine learning challenge: fraud detection with distribution shifts over time due to the adversarial nature of the environment. We show that SPADE consistently outperforms existing methods considered."

For anomaly detection, the labels y \u2208 Y are either normal (0) or anomalous (1) and there are far more normal examples than anomaly, i.e., P(y = 0) P(y = 1). Most semi-supervised methods assume that both labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution (i.e., P l X = P u X ). In this work, we aren't limited by this assumption and allow the scenario of the distributions between labeled and unlabeled data to be different (i.e., P l X = P u X ). We exemplify such scenarios in Fig. 1. For instance, if new anomaly types are only included in the unlabeled data, P u X would be different from P l X . The labels y are determined by the unknown function f * : X \u2192 Y where x l , x u \u2208 X . Our main objective is to construct an anomaly detection model f : X \u2192 Y that can minimize the test loss L(f (x), y) in the union of P l X and P u X . As a way of motivation, the conventional approaches to tackle this problem along with their limitations are summarized in Table . 1. All these are quantitatively compared with SPADE in Sec. 5.

We aim to train a binary classifier for normal and anomalous data by iteratively learning from labeled and pseudo-labeled data. As such, the key component is the pseudo-labeler to assign binary labels to unlabeled data. While it is common to use a trained binary classifier for pseudo-labeling (Lee et al., 2013;Sohn et al., 2020), we argue that it may be sub-optimal for anomaly detection with distribution shift as the decision boundaries of binary classifiers could be highly biased by the small labeled data. As shown in Fig. 2(b,c), this would have a negative impact when labeled and unlabeled data distributions are mismatched. Instead, we decouple the pseudo-labeler from the trained binary classifier and build it with OCCs. While this cannot utilize the labeled positive data like binary classifiers, it would prevent overfitting to the small amount of labeled data, and thus can be more robust to distribution shifts, as shown in Fig. 2(d)."

One option is considering them as user-defined hyper-parameters and determining them by the hyper-parameter optimization. However, hyperparameter tuning requires extra validation data which should come from labeled training set (same impacts as reducing the number of labeled samples in training data which is critical in semi-supervised setting). Instead, we propose to learn these parameters without sacrificing the labeled data for validation. We propose adapting the partial matching method (Christoffel et al., 2016), which has been developed to estimate the marginal distribution of unlabeled data by matching the distribution to the known one-class (either positive or negative) distribution. The underlying intuition is that normal samples are closer to other normal samples, and anomalous samples are closer to other anomalous samples. In our case, we match the distribution of anomaly scores of the positive labeled data to that of unlabeled data to estimate their marginal distribution and determine \u03b7 p accordingly. The same is applied to determine \u03b7 n using negative labeled data. Formulations for \u03b7 p and \u03b7 n are given in Eqs. 3 and 4 below:",

For these tasks, anomalies are evolving (i.e., their distributions are changing over time) (Grover et al., 2022).

The accuracy of the pseudo-labeler is highly related to the robustness of semi-supervised anomaly detection. We analyze the accuracy (in precision) of the pseudo-labels vs. anomaly score percentiles for both normal and anomalous samples.  Fig. 4 shows that the proposed pseudo-labeler achieves fairly robust pseudo-labeling for normal samples. On the other hand, for anomalous samples, the precision of pseudo-labeling gets high typically when the anomaly scores are higher than 80%, however we observe drop in precision in some cases, which we attribute to imperfect OCC fitting. While this underlines the room for improvement for pseudo-labeling, due to the robustness of partial matching, the impact of imperfect precision on anomaly detection performance is low. Note that our partial matching algorithm catches this threshold fairly accurately to make pseudo-labels robust without any threshold parameter tuning.",

All components of the SPADE are observed to contribute to the robust anomaly detection performance considerably. Self-supervised learning component contributes to 0.018 AUC improvements of SPADE framework. In addition, with majority votes instead of unanimous votes for pseudo-labeling, the performance of SPADE is degraded by 0.024 AUC.

This underlines the impact of utilizing the unlabeled data. In addition, the performances are similar across different \u03b1 > 0, demonstrating that SPADE isn't sensitive to the hyper-parameter \u03b1.

                "Semi-supervised anomaly detection is a highly-important challenge in practice -in many scenarios, we cannot assume that the distributions of labeled and unlabeled samples are the same. In this paper, we focus on this and demonstrate the underperformance of standard frameworks in this setting. We propose a novel framework, SPADE, which introduces a novel pseudo-labeling mechanism using an ensemble of OCCs and a judicious way of combining supervised and self-supervised learning. In addition, our framework involves a novel approach to pick hyperparameters without a validation set, a crucial component for data-efficient anomaly detection. Overall, we show that SPADE consistently outperforms the alternatives in various scenarios -AUC improvements with SPADE can be up to 10.6% on tabular data and 3.6% on image data. In addition to anomaly detection, future work can extend this semi-supervised framework to multi-class classification or regression with distribution mismatch."
