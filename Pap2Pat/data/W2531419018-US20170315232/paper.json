    "abstract": "We describe the evolution of coastal HF radar observations of tsunamis, first proposed in 1979 and developed after the 2004 Indonesia and 2011 Japan tsunamis to allow routine monitoring to detect an approaching tsunami. Oceanographic tsunami theory is summarized, both for the fundamental equations of motion and in the ray optics and Green's Law approximations; the latter can be applied when water depths are slowly varying. Observations of the current velocities caused by the 2011 Japan tsunami off the Japanese, the US West, and Chilean coasts are described and examples are shown. These observations led to the development of an empirical tsunami detection method, which is outlined. Examples of offline tsunami detections are given and detection times are compared with arrival times at neighboring tide gauges. We describe the observation and offline detection of the June 2013 meteotsunami off the New Jersey coast using coastal radar systems and tide gauges. Methods to model and simulate tsunami velocities are described and videos of the resulting velocity/height maps are given. We describe preliminary methods for evaluating the suitability of radar sites for tsunami detection using simulated tsunami velocities. Factors affecting tsunami detectability are discussed and methods are described for the alleviation of false alarms.",

                "High-frequency (HF) radars were first used for ocean observations in the 1960s. Located on the coast and transmitting vertically polarized radiations, they exploit the high conductivity of sea water to propagate their signals well beyond the visible or microwave-radar horizon. They have found widespread use for mapping surface currents and monitoring sea state.",
                "Barrick [1] suggested in 1979 that these radars could detect tsunamis by means of their orbital wave velocity as they approach the coast. Because the distribution of radars around the world was sparse until the 1990s, this concept was not pursued until the tsunami caused by the catastrophic 2004 Banda Aceh earthquake in Indonesia claimed a quarter of a million lives. Although there were no radars in place to observe that event, work began to quantify the radar tsunami response. It was not until the 2011 Tohoku (Japan) tsunami that sufficient radars were in place to capture real tsunami data, which led to development of algorithms to provide robust detection and warning. The Japan tsunami signal was observed by many HF radars around the Pacific Rim with clear results from sites in Japan, USA, and Chile [2][3][4]. Additional weak tsunamis have also been observed: the 2012 Indonesia tsunami [5] and the 2013 US East Coast meteotsunami [6]. A database of actual HF radar tsunami observations from both strong and weak tsunamis has been accumulated, which has been used to identify the tsunami current velocity signature in the background ocean current velocity field. An empirical method for the automatic detection of a tsunami has been developed, based on pattern recognition in the velocity time series. Over 350 HF radar stations operate from many coastal locations, see, for example, http://www.codar.com/seasonde_world_locations.shtml, providing continuous measurement of surface current velocities and waves. Tsunami detection software can run in a background mode, issuing a warning before the tsunami strikes the coast.",
                "The first possible indication of a tsunami might be the seismic detection of an earthquake. However, not all subsea earthquakes produce tsunamis, and hence the magnitude of an earthquake cannot be used to forecast the detailed generation or intensity of a resulting tsunami. At present, the only operational sensor that detects a tsunami and measures its intensity is a bottom pressure sensor connected to a buoy overhead. Developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), networks of these sensors called DART \u2122 (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami) were deployed after the 2004 event. They observe the height of the tsunami wave as it passes above them. The tsunami height measured by these buoys is then entered into numerical tsunami models [7][8] to give rough forecasts of the tsunami arrival time and intensity at coastal points around the world. As this network is located in the deep ocean, not all tsunamis are observable by DART and then are not entered into the model before coastal impact. Furthermore, the model's forecast of intensity at the coast is often coarse, so that more accurate estimates of intensity at specific locations are needed; such local variations not captured by the models are referred to as \"near field.\" HF radars make their areal observations over this local near field and so provide an ideal solution to this need. We describe an empirical tsunami detection algorithm that can run in the background on these radars. This can detect and warn of an approaching tsunami in the near-shore region over which these radars observe the sea surface. A total of 21 offline radar detections of tsunamis have been made to date. Many are described here and others are reported in the literature [2,3,5]. A tsunami's orbital velocity appears as part of the surface current as the wave approaches the coast. Tsunami periods lie typically between 20 and 50 min. A tsunami originates when there is a massive displacement of water: The spatial scales of water displacement are the spatial scales of water displacement are usually of great horizontal but small vertical dimensions These include subsea earthquakes where plates force each other upward/downward, respectively; subsea landslides along steep submerged mountainous slopes; or fast-moving atmospheric anomalies (e.g. low-pressure centers) that create \"meteotsunamis.\" The sources can be thousands of kilometers from an impacted coastal area (where an HF radar might be located), or very close. As the displaced water mass leaves its source region under the influence of gravity, it becomes a freely propagating shallow-water wave. Although the origins of meteotsunamis vis-\u00e0-vis seismically generated tsunamis differ, the propagation and evolution of these shallow-water waves are the same, as are the applicable detection and warning methods. Tsunami warning times are mainly dependent on the width of the adjacent continental shelf, ranging from minutes for a narrow shelf (e.g. California) to hours when the shelf is broad (e.g. New Jersey). Some sites may be less suitable for tsunami monitoring by radar, as the tsunami signature can be masked by large, variable background currents. Tsunami detection is favored by shallow water extending far offshore and by slowly varying background current fields. We describe a method for the evaluation of a coastal site for tsunami warning based on simulated tsunami velocities superimposed on the site's measured velocities. Factors affecting radar detection of tsunamis are discussed. Difficulties that can occur in tsunami detection and methods for alleviation are described. At present, work on the evaluation of coastal sites for tsunami warning using HF radars is being performed in a partnership between Codar Ocean Sensors and NOAA.",

                        "Traveling waves, such as tsunami or electromagnetic waves, sometimes follow simple ray optics approximations where they can refract, changing their direction continuously with the refractive index. The refractive index for waves of any nature propagating through media with different or changing properties is defined as the ratio of the reference phase velocity to the phase velocity at the specific point in the medium. For light or electromagnetic waves, the reference velocity is taken as the speed of light in vacuum. For acoustic waves or water waves in the shallow-depth limit, one normally selects a convenient reference velocity [10]. So, for example, if one selected the 4000-m depth which is typical of a deep ocean basin, the refractive index becomes 4000/, which is sometimes referred to as the HF asymptotic limit. This approximation applies only when refractive index varies slowly and smoothly with distance. This means that the refractive index cannot have a discontinuous jump, for example, if the bottom had a significant change in depth over scales shorter than a wavelength, say 10 km. Bottom depth fluctuations over smaller scales are not important to tsunami propagation. The tsunami wave, with its massive inertia, is like a low-pass spatial filter that effectively averages across these fine-scale features. A wave typically does not respond appreciably to perturbations with a scale much smaller than its wavelength; this is sometimes known as the Rayleigh criterion. As tsunami wavelengths exceed tens of kilometers, this implies that perturbations with smaller spatial scales (e.g.10 km) are unimportant. There is an often-asked question: \"Do I need to use a bathymetry database for tsunami near-field modeling with 1-2 km resolution?\"",

This approximation has the consequence that there is always only one set of ray paths, which end up perpendicular to the coastline. The coastline boundary will reflect; outgoing rays also cross the contours perpendicularly.",

Test radar sites are located at Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML1) on the US West Coast and Brant Beach (BRNT) on the US East Coast. BML1 has a steep offshore bathymetry profile, that is a narrow continental shelf; it also has low background noise. In contrast, BRNT has a shallow offshore bathymetry profile, that is a wide continental shelf, but this site has higher background noise. Our analysis shows that for these two radar sites, the offshore bathymetry dominates the tsunami detection capability.

However, the signal-to-noise ratios for the BRNT antennas were observed to be about 20 dB less than those for BML1, indicating noisy spectra and reduced tsunami detection capability. This is an example of variations in local external noise that are sometimes seen among coastal HF radars.",

For BRNT, this limit does not apply, as here the continental shelf extends beyond the limits of the radar coverage.  With the empirical detection algorithm applied to noisy background velocities, a nonlinear pattern results as the multiplicative factor F is varied in Step 5 of the evaluation analysis described in Section 6.1. As F is increased from zero, the q-factor increases in stages as different components of the detection methods apply to the band velocities. When the q-factor exceeds the preset limit, this defines the value of F(F detect ) that signals a detection. Preset limits are set produce minimal false alarms while allowing detection of observed tsunamis. In Figure 18, F detect is plotted vs. range from the radar: range is defined as the central value for the five 2-km bands, for example, for bands 1-5 (distance from shore 0-10 km), the central value is 5 km.",

Substituting these values, the depths from the site and the values of F detect shown in Figure 18, into Eqs ( 12) and ( 13) leads to estimates for the tsunami velocity V detect and height H detect required for a detection of the initial simulated tsunami approach. From Table 3, the height of the simulated tsunami required to trigger a detection is generally larger for BML1 than for BRNT particularly at greater ranges where the water is deeper. This occurs in spite of the lower BRNT signal-to-noise ratio, indicating that the shallow offshore bathymetry dominates the tsunami detection capability. We note that values shown in Table 3 are noisy. Noise reduction will require the analysis of more extended data sets."

If it is set too high, false alarms will be eliminated, but then the first actual tsunami peak may be missed. This is the classic \"probability-of-detection vs. false-alarm rate\" trade-off encountered by warning sensor systems. An acceptably low false-alarm rate for a given tsunami intensity and detection distance from shore are the parameters to be optimized at each site.

Not all subsea earthquakes generate tsunamis. The assumption here is that any subsea earthquake with magnitude higher than 5 can be considered to be the origin of a tsunami. The approximate expected arrival time can be calculated from Eq. ( 10) using the depth profile between the earthquake origin and the radar near field of interest. A threat window can be set up within \u00b10.5 h of the predicted arrival time, and any q-factor candidates within this window would be given increased priority."

                "The use of HF coastal radars to detect and warn of approaching tsunamis was proposed nearly 40 years ago [1]. Radars measure the tsunami wave's orbital velocity, unlike all other tsunami sensors that measure its height. However, it was not until the 2004 tragic Banda Aceh event that killed a quarter of a million people that attention was seriously focused on developing a local warning system. After the significant 2011 Tohoku, Japan tsunami, enough radars were in place worldwide to gather a radar-signal database that allowed the development of detection and warning methodology.",
                "Several papers ensued demonstrating a detection algorithm and developments followed toward a methodology to capitalize on this near-field monitoring capability [2][3][5][6]. The present work presents a summary of these prior works and also covers recent work on tsunami simulation and site evaluation that has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "In the last 5 years, tsunami events were detected by 21 SeaSonde HF coastal radars. Times between detection and arrival at shore (as confirmed by tide gages) ranged between 1 and 43 min. This alert time for a tsunami of given intensity depends principally on the offshore bathymetry. A shallow shelf edge affords a much longer alert time than a steep drop-off. We have examined and compared approximate and exact methods for estimating the arrival. The latter include the solution of exact linear partial differential equations, especially suited to near-field HF observations; in the future, this will also allow the radar-measured orbital velocity to be related to the height of the approaching wave.",
                "We have also described steps toward simulation of tsunami height and velocity. This allows the assessment of the warning possible at a given site location based on the offshore bathymetry, background currents, and noise. False-alarm rate and probability of detection are the metrics against which performance is evaluated. Methods of increasing the latter while decreasing the former are examined. These include correlations with similar alerts from other nearby radars and with reports on seismic events that may constitute tsunamigenic sources.",
                "After radars on the US East Coast detected a meteotsunami in 2013 that provided an alert that was missed by conventional methods, NOAA recognized the potential that the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) could offer for tsunami warning. IOOS consists of 130 SeaSonde radars around the US coast. The NOAA Tsunami Warning Program office and IOOS entered into a partnership with Codar Ocean Sensors to optimize this capability based on steps outlined in this report and organized its transition to the two operational tsunami warning centers in Hawaii and Alaska.",
                "It is clear that early local detection of incoming tsunamis by deployed radar systems is now within the capabilities of existing technology."
