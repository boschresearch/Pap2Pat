                        "Tsunamis are typically produced by either abrupt surface-floor physical displacements (e.g., subsea earthquakes or landslides) or atmospheric anomalies (e.g., the latter are called meteo-tsunamis). So the first possible indication of a tsunami might be the seismic detection of an earthquake. However, not all subsea earthquakes produce tsunamis, and hence the magnitude of an earthquake cannot be used to forecast the generation or intensity of a resulting tsunami.",
                        "One type of sensor that sees and measures the intensity of a tsunami is a bottom pressure sensor connected to a buoy overhead. Developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), networks of these sensors (called DART\u2122 for Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami) were deployed after the catastrophic 2004 Banda Aceh (Indonesia) earthquake whose subsequent tsunami claimed a quarter of a million lives. DART\u2122 sensors observe the height of the tsunami wave as it passes above them. The tsunami height measured by these buoys is then inputted to numerical tsunami models to give rough forecasts of arrival and intensity at coastal points around the world. An example of such a numerical model is described in Implementation and testing of the Method of Splitting Tsunami (MOST) model, V. Titov and F. Gonzalez, NOAA Tech. Memo. ERL PMEL-112 (PB98-122773), NOAA/Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, Seattle, Wash., 11 pp, (1997), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.",
                        "However, the DART\u2122 network is still sparse, so that not all tsunamis can be observed and inputted to the model before coastal impact. Furthermore, because of the wide range of variation of the bathymetry (i.e., depth of water offshore) of different coastal regions, the model's forecast of timing and intensity at the coast is often only very coarse."

Further, well known features may not have been described in detail for the sake of clarity.",
                        "This disclosure describes systems for effective tsunami detection and warning using coastal high frequency (HF) radars. Many national networks of coastal HF radars already exist, primarily for the real-time mapping of ocean surface currents. We describe configurations of these radars that are able to detect and warn of an approaching tsunami in the system's \u201cnear field,\u201d i.e., the near-shore region over which the radars observe the sea surface. In contrast with the DART\u2122 tsunami warning systems that observe and forecast the height of the tsunami wave in the deep ocean basins, HF radars do not observe the tsunami wave's height, but instead observe a more sensitive indicator: its orbital velocity as it moves into shallow waters close to shore.",
                        "The tsunami's orbital velocity becomes part of the surface current as the wave of typically 10-50 minutes period approaches the coast. However, the normal background flows, as well as external atmospheric noise and radio interference can mask the tsunami pattern, potentially producing unacceptable false-alarm rates. Systems enabled by the present disclosure separate the signal representing the tsunami's orbital velocity from these background masking effects and accurately detect tsunamis in the near field of coastal HF radar.",
                        "High frequency (HF) radars were first used in the 1960's. Located on the coast and transmitting vertical polarization, they exploit the high conductivity of sea water to propagate their signals\u2014in a surface-wave mode\u2014well beyond the visible or microwave-radar horizon. They have found widespread use for mapping surface currents and monitoring sea state (e.g., wave heights). The radar echo comes from the well-known Bragg scatter by ocean waves half the radar wavelength, traveling toward and away from the radar. See, for example, Sea backscatter at HF: Interpretation and utilization of the echo, Barrick, D. E., J. M. Headrick, R. W. Bogle, and D. D. Crombie, Proc. IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 673-680 (1974), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.",
                        "Barrick postulated in 1979 that HF radars could detect a tsunami by means of its orbital wave velocity as it approached the coast. See A Coastal Radar System for Tsunami Warning, Barrick, D. E., Remote Sensing of Environment, Vol. 8, 353-358 (1979), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. However, because the distribution of HF radars around the world was sparse until the 1990s, there was no opportunity to validate this concept and develop the software to overcome the many challenges that are encountered. This began to change after the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, and by the 2011 Tohoku Japan tsunami, there were sufficient radars in place to capture the raw data necessary for the development of algorithms to provide robust detection and warning.",
                        "The quantitative metrics typically used by warning centers to decide system effectiveness\u2014and hence utility\u2014are: Probability of detection, Pd, and false-alarm probability, Pfa (sometimes referred to as false-positive probability). As discussed in greater detail below, a particular class of implementations employs the \u201cq-factor\u201d tsunami pattern recognition algorithm, where ideally a q-factor alert is sent only if a tsunami has been observed. This is based on the q-factor trigger exceeding a preset threshold. The tradeoff is this: if the threshold is set too high, the tsunami is not seen (i.e., Pd is unacceptably low). On the other hand, if the threshold is too low, tsunamis are detected (i.e., Pd is acceptable), but Pfa is too high, meaning too many false alarms are seen. Since a tsunami is a rare occurrence, one false alarm per day would certainly be considered too high, and system output alerts would tend to be ignored.",
                        "The threshold and filtering parameters that determine Pd and Pfa depend on several factors. These include sometimes intense and/or complex background current patterns that overlay any tsunami pattern; varying external noise and man-made radio interference; and echoes from other non-tsunami targets (e.g., ships, the ionosphere). The tsunami's orbital velocity magnitude depends very much on water depth. A shallow continental shelf that extends out far allows longer warning times, as velocity depends roughly on depth to the inverse three-quarters power. A tsunami's detectability also depends on its intensity. The impact of each of these factors on ultimate detection robustness (high Pd and low Pfa) is discussed in more detail below. As will become apparent, implementations enabled by the present disclosure provide HF-radar-based tsunami detection systems that operate according to performance metrics\u2014Pd and Pfa\u2014that are applicable for the geographic region in which they are deployed.",

Two of the three signals 100, 110, and 120 received by receiver 12 represent signals generated by the transmitters of the associated sites. Signals 130 from a constellation of GPS satellites impinge on the GPS antenna 1, and are passed to GPS receiver 2. GPS receiver 2 is designed specifically to extract time information from the GPS signals, in contrast with the far more common positional information of conventional GPS receivers.",

GPS receiver also generates a very stable one-pulse-per-second data stream that is fed to the radar state machine 5. The 10 MHz signal fed to the phase-locked oscillator 3, is converted to a 120 MHz timing signal that is used for generation of the radar carrier and other internal frequencies. This 120 MHz reference signal is passed to the clock generator 4. It divides the reference signal down to generate a number of other reference frequencies needed by other devices including a 12 MHz signal fed to microprocessor 7; a 40 MHz signal fed to the radar state machine 5; and a 60 or 120 MHz signal that is passed to a direct signal synthesizer (DSS) and its oscillators 6.",

In the simulator mode of operation, a determination may be made as to whether a candidate HF radar site (with its characteristic bathymetry, background currents, and noise) is suitable as a tsunami warning system site.

                        "The processing steps depicted in FIGS. 2 and 3 relate to a number of phenomena that are taken into account to ensure reliable system performance. For example, variable external background interference and/or noise is a factor that significantly affects tsunami detection and may give rise to false alarms if the detection threshold is too low. Even very sporadic interference (e.g., once every several days) can give rise to a false positive with the q-factor pattern-recognition algorithm employed by some implementations. But one false alarm per week is usually deemed undesirable. Therefore, various implementations include methods to detect the presence of such interference, along with filtering where possible to remove it. If it cannot be removed, then passing along a disclaimer with any q-factor alerts during high interference periods may inform the warning-center manager's decision regarding how to respond.",
                        "In another example, the real-time currents that have long been reported by coastal HF radars vary with location and time. Temporal variations may either be predictable (e.g., tides) or unpredictable (due to many causes, such as storms). Their patterns within the radar coverage where tsunami detection is desired can be quite complex. In a few cases\u2014and even with the best mitigation methods\u2014these background flow variations can be mistaken for a tsunami and hence produce an alert from the recognition algorithm. An effective way to handle this for a given site is to study the background currents and how the detection algorithm responds to them over a several-month period. Simulation techniques are described that accomplish this and mitigate the impact of this and other background factors.",
                        "In another example, and unlike noise/interference discussed above (which originates from other sources and is present even in the absence of the transmitted signal), echoes from targets such as ships or from the moving ionosphere overhead admit the possibility of being confused as tsunami echoes if they drift into or near the Bragg sea-echo peak. Techniques are described for detecting and filtering to remove such spurious echoes.",
                        "In another example, the depth of water offshore (bathymetry) has a strong influence on tsunami detectability by an HF radar system. This phenomenon is, of course, highly dependent on the radar site. Techniques are described for simulating this phenomenon using numerical models for near-field tsunami propagation based on the local bathymetry. The results of these simulations are then used to guide in the selection of detectability thresholds and other parameters.",
                        "Another example relates to the fact that false alarms at any point in the processing stream may be considered to be random events. This means that known information from other sources might be useful in identifying real detections and eliminating spurious events from further consideration. A time window is established around a candidate alert and, if an event from an independent, confirmatory source occurs within this time window, the likelihood that the alert is a true detection is much higher, and it gets passed along to the next stage. Since the purpose of such correlation windows/filters is to eliminate false alarms, this behavior can be evaluated for several months on any new system on which the software is installed. The assumption is that a real tsunami that would trigger an alert is extremely rare, and unlikely to occur during this learning phase. Therefore all candidate alerts that exceed a threshold may be considered to be false alarms. Then, after several months of adjusting system parameters to minimize false alarms, simulated tsunami signals of a given amplitude\u2014based on the near-field tsunami model\u2014may be injected into this data stream to assess its probability of detection.",
                        "In another example, a credibility level assessment may be made in real time to assess the detectability of a tsunami of a given amplitude at the radar area and for that time period based on current conditions. This allows for the adjustment of an alert warning signal priority based on changing background conditions. For example, an alert at one time could be a credible tsunami indicator, whereas later it might not because of higher interference. At least some of the factors that impact the credibility of an alert are mentioned above.",
                        "Referring now to FIG. 2, a simulator mode of system operation will be described in which the performance and/or suitability of a HF radar site for tsunami detection is evaluated. This involves running the process depicted in FIG. 2 on the site radar (e.g., for several months) to assess its performance against local background limitations. As discussed above, an important characteristic of the site during this phase is the bathymetry of the coastal region of the site as this affects detectability and warning time. The results of the simulator mode of operation allow for the optimization of detectability thresholds and other parameters for the online mode of operation illustrated in FIG. 3.",

From these spectra, the processing represented by Block B searches for both radio interference and natural noise. Natural noise is normally \u201cflat\u201d vs. Doppler frequency and range; sometimes and in some locations it is higher. It is important to catalog this, especially near the Bragg echo peaks within which tsunamis are to be detected. Radio interference, however, has a unique appearance, often as intense bands or peaks in range and Doppler frequency. Again, appearance of such interference bands that cross over or lie parallel but close to the Bragg peaks is problematic. How often they occur and time of day is logged into databases. Radio interference often occurs only at certain times of day/night.",

Within each band, it is determined whether the velocity increases or decreases by an amount greater than a preset level over two consecutive time intervals. If it increases or decreases a q-level parameter is incremented or decremented, respectively, for that band. It is then determined whether the maximum/minimum velocities for consecutive bands coincide (within a preset value) for consecutive time intervals. If so, the q-level parameter for that band and time is increased (where the maximum velocities coincide) or decreased (where the minimum velocities coincide).

By themselves, the velocities as contaminated by noise and background tides, would have been difficult to resolve without this pattern-recognition algorithm. As shown in the figure, the empirically established q-factor tsunami pattern recognizer precisely identifies the first tsunami peak (as confirmed by coastal tide gages).

The additional processing described herein, during both modes of operation serve to reduce the likelihood of such false alarms while enhancing the probability of accurate detection.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 3, Block F represents one way in which at least some false alarms may be eliminated from among the alerts generated by tsunami pattern recognition of Block E. This is done by examining q-factor outputs (307) from adjacent HF radars. A real tsunami should be seen at two coastal locations 30 km apart, for example, within a definable time window (e.g., a 10-30 minutes). Tsunami waves refract as they move into the ever-shallower water of the continental shelf near the coast. This means they tend to arrive perpendicular to the shore. This forces similar arrival times at locations along a nearly straight coastline over these short distances. Hence, if a high q-factor peak at Radar M arrives at a given range within 15 minutes of a high q-factor peak at Radar N, the presence of both raises the probability that a real tsunami is being seen by orders of magnitude and the alert (308) is passed along. Likewise, if a high q-factor at Radar M has no counterpart at Radar N, this raises greatly the probability that the \u201calert\u201d spike was in fact a false alarm. Thus, the solitary alert can either be eliminated as a false alarm, or a flag attached to the alert (308) that gives it a much lower credibility. This allows for options by personnel at a tsunami warning center when evaluating and comparing with other information to decide on a course of action.",

An algorithm (represented by Block I) based on the depth profile between the earthquake origin and the radar near-field of interest is used to calculate an expected arrival time (310) of a tsunami generated by the detected earthquake. This is based on the simple equation for tsunami phase-velocity vs. depth. The algorithm predicts when the radar will be able to detect the tsunami based on the time and location of the earthquake. This does not necessarily need to be a full partial differential equation (PDE) numerical model in order to define a suitable window (e.g., \u00b130 minutes) at the radar. For example, if \u0394T is defined as the time interval between the known earthquake occurrence and the time to reach the edge of the near-field radar coverage area, then a simple but adequate estimate of this is given by:",

Conversely, a q-factor alert exceeding an alert threshold that was not preceded by a subsea earthquake (or equivalent event) may be eliminated (at the discretion of the warning center manager). It should be noted that, although earthquakes are described as an origin of tsunamis, other origins are known such as, for example, subsea landslides and fast-moving atmospheric anomalies that produce \u201cmeteo-tsunamis.\u201d Timely warnings for both of these types of events are also available online and may therefore be used in a similar manner to define time windows at a radar for enhanced alert credibility. Again, the purpose is to flag more credible q-factor alerts and downgrade others that are not accompanied by a source warning. It should also be noted that only a fraction of subsea earthquakes or atmospheric anomalies produce measurable tsunamis. As such, alerts of such events do not mean a tsunami will be seen by the radar; merely that it may be advisable to establish a \u201cwatch\u201d in order to raise HF radar robustness and credibility by increasing detection probability and reducing false alarms.",

This information is used by the processing represented by Block J to forecast the height, water orbital velocity, and arrival time at the coast (313) from the point and time of detection; the latter being derived from the q-factor alert(s).",

They may be solved on personal computing devices with conventional, commercially-available packages like MATLAB, using the associated PDE toolbox. The offshore bathymetry is included as the depth variable, d(x,y), and the coastline becomes a boundary for the domain. Normally, we find it easier to solve the second PDE, scalar Equation (5) for the tsunami wave height. Then velocity is obtained by integrating the left side of Equation (2).

The time of arrival at the coast may also be extracted from these modeled results based on the distance and time it was first detected by the radar.

The background noise and interference levels (314) from Block B are employed to determine the credibility of any q-factor alerts. For example, if noise is high in a given period, peaks during the period would be lowered in credibility or perhaps eliminated. This may be done by comparison of the orbital velocity at the q-factor alert peak with a visibility threshold based on the noise itself as determined in Block B. Any remaining tsunami alerts are then ready to pass to the tsunami warning center. It should be noted that such radar-based alerts may be correlated with any other information available to the tsunami warning center, and then integrated into suitable displays for action by the center personnel.",
