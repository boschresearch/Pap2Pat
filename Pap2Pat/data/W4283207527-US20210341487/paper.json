    "title": "Interference in a Neutralizing Antibody Assay for Odronextamab, a CD20xCD3 Bispecific mAb, from Prior Rituximab Therapy and Possible Mitigation Strategy",
    "date": "2022-06-21",
    "abstract": "A cell-based assay was developed to detect neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (NAbs) against odronextamab, a CD20xCD3 bispecific monoclonal antibody (mAb) under investigation for treatment of CD20+ B cell malignancies. In this assay, odronextamab bridges between two cell types, CD20-expressing HEK293 cells and CD3-expressing Jurkat T cells that generate a luciferase signal upon CD3 clustering. Patient samples containing NAbs directed to either arm of the bispecific drug block the odronextamab bridge formation between the cell lines thus preventing the generation of the luciferase signal. We determined that other anti-CD20 therapeutics also block bridge formation, resulting in false-positive results. In patient samples from odronextamab clinical trials, approximately 30% of baseline samples had a strong false-positive NAb signal that correlated with the presence of prior rituximab (anti-CD20) therapy. We determined that rituximab interference can be minimized by the addition of anti-rituximab antibodies in the NAb assay. Understanding and mitigating the impact of prior biologic exposure is increasingly important for implementing a successful bioanalytical strategy to support clinical drug development, especially in the immuno-oncology field. Graphical Abstract Odronextamab neutralizing antibody assay, interference, and mitigation. A Design of the odronextamab neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay where anti-CD20xCD3 drug bridges between CD20-expressing HEK293 cells and Jurkat T cells expressing an NFAT response element and luciferase reporter. True NAb prevents odronextamab from bridging between target and effector cells, thus preventing the expression of luciferase. B Interference with odronextamab from other anti-CD20 therapeutic antibodies (e.g., rituximab) from prior disease treatment generates a false-positive NAb result. Assay interference can be mitigated with an anti-idiotypic antibody against the interfering therapy.",

                "The protein therapeutics portion of the pharmaceuticals market continues to grow; biologics were almost 40% of all new therapeutic drugs over the past 3 years and almost 60% of sales in 2021 (1). However, unlike small molecule drugs, biologics can induce an unwanted immune response that results in the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). In clinical trials, participants are monitored for the presence of ADA to ensure safety for the patients and efficacy of the drug. NAbs are a subset of ADA that prevent the biological activity of the drug. By definition, they reduce the pharmacological effect of the therapeutic, potentially reducing clinical response (2). Furthermore, when the drug is a biological mimic of an endogenous protein, ADAs can cross-react with the endogenous analog and in the case of ADAs with neutralizing capacity (NAbs), may result in serious adverse events (3). Thus, it is critically important to accurately monitor the formation of NAb during clinical drug development.",
                "Odronextamab (REGN1979) is a hinge stabilized human IgG4 bispecific antibody with one binding site specific to CD20 and the other binding site specific to CD3 (4,5). The drug is designed to bridge between CD20-expressing tumor cells and CD3-expressing cytotoxic T cells to activate T cellmediated killing of CD20-positive target cells (5).",
                "To support continued clinical advancement of odronextamab, a cell-based NAb method was developed that detects antibodies against either arm of the bispecific mAb in a single assay. In the assay, drug binds to HEK293 cells engineered to express CD20 and to CD3-expressing Jurkat T cells which were engineered to generate luciferase upon CD3 clustering and downstream nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling. In the presence of NAb, odronextamab bridge formation between target and effector cells is inhibited, thus preventing the induction of the reporter signal. Importantly, this functional bioassay format recapitulates the mechanism of action of the drug in vivo, where odronextamab redirects T cells to a tumor associated antigen on target cells. Furthermore, the ability of the assay to detect NAb to either arm of the bispecific drug presents an advantage over a ligand-based format which would require two separate assays: one assay for each target.",
                "Therapy for patients with advanced stage lymphomas can include treatment with an anti-CD20 antibody (e.g., rituximab or obinutuzumab) in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy (6,7). Consequently, odronextamab clinical trials include patients with B cell malignancies which may express CD20, who were previously treated with a CD20-directed biologic therapy and have relapsed or are refractory, and thus have a continued unmet medical need (Table I). However, if still present systemically, the prior anti-CD20 therapeutic could potentially bind to CD20 on engineered HEK293 cells in the NAb assay, preventing odronextamab-CD20 binding and bridging of target and reporter cells. This would inhibit the downstream luciferase signal, thus generating a false-positive NAb signal. Therefore, residual rituximab or other CD20-specific mAbs in serum samples have the potential to present a major challenge during development of the odronextamab NAb assay.",
                "This manuscript describes the development and characterization of the cell-based odronextamab NAb assay that detects either anti-CD20-or anti-CD3-specific NAb in the same method. In addition, interference from anti-CD20 mAbs in clinical study samples was demonstrated to be a source of false-positive results. As such, a strategy to mitigate the false-positive NAb signal was developed by sample pretreatment with blocking antibodies specific for the CD20directed therapies."

The addition of odronextamab bridges the aforementioned cell types, leads to CD3 clustering on the surface of the reporter cells stimulating a downstream signaling cascade, which induces the expression of the reporter and a dose-dependent luciferase signal (Fig. 1a, first two panels; Fig. 1b).

As expected, these antibodies inhibited the bridging of odronextamab between the target and reporter cells, demonstrated by concentration-dependent inhibition of the luciferase signal (Fig. 2). In contrast, the addition of mouse IgG isotype control mAbs did not inhibit the luciferase signal, indicating the assay specifically detected NAb against odronextamab (Fig. 2). Sensitivity of the NAb assay was determined to be 158 ng/mL for the positive control against the anti-CD3 binding site and 1067 ng/mL for the positive control against the anti-CD20 binding site of odronextamab.

To assess this, a serial dilution of odronextamab was tested in the assay in the presence of 5% or 10% normal human serum to mimic conditions of clinical samples (data not shown). We found that serum did not significantly interfere with the luciferase signal generated in the presence of drug in mock samples. Interference of matrix was also evaluated in the NAb assay. Hemolyzed samples generated false-positive results; however, this finding was not surprising as hemolysis is a known interferent in luciferase-based assays (8).

The assay platform is designed to mimic the in vivo ability of odronextamab to redirect T cells (expressing CD3) against cells expressing a tumorassociated antigen (CD20). Neutralizing anti-odronextamab antibodies are detected in the assay by functionally blocking the biological effect of the drug.",
                "As a proof of concept, monoclonal antibodies specific to either binding site of the bispecific drug generated a positive NAb signal in the method in a concentration-dependent manner. The cell-based assay format was also able to detect NAb directed to either binding site of odronextamab, providing an advantage compared to a ligand-binding assay (LBA) design which would require two independent assays. The cell-based NAb assay had sensitivity values of 158 ng/mL and 1067 ng/mL for the anti-CD3-arm and anti-CD20-arm positive controls, respectively. The assay cut point was calculated by excluding baseline patient study samples with strong NAb positive results (i.e., false-positive NAb results above the assay positive control); this conservative approach Fig. 2 Anti-odronextamab Abs prevent odronextamab-induced luciferase signal. A titration of monoclonal antibodies specific to either the CD20-binding site (anti-drug antibodies 1, 2, and 3) or the CD3-binding site of odronextamab (anti-drug antibodies 4 through 7) were co-incubated with 30 ng/mL odronextamab in the NAb assay. The NFAT activity was determined by luciferase signal and is expressed relative to control wells without the addition of competing mAbs. The 7 drugspecific antibodies all resulted in a concentration-dependent NAb-positive assay signal, while the two isotype control antibodies did not for the statistical analysis was used to minimize false-negative NAb results.",
                "Sensitivity values are based on the monoclonal antibody positive control. The values for these positive control reagents, particularly the anti-CD20 mAb, are higher than the 100 ng/mL recommended for ADA assay sensitivity (9). However, neutralizing responses are a subset of ADA and it is expected that NAb assays will be less sensitive because the methods detect a secondary readout rather than a direct binding event. In addition, NAb assays also suffer from limitations in drug tolerance (10): the drug-tolerance level in this assay is less than the trough concentration of drug. Importantly, it is increasingly becoming clear that supersensitive and drug tolerant immunogenicity assays do not improve detection of clinically impactful immunogenicity (10)(11)(12).",
                "Consistent with the differences in sensitivity values in this antibodies raised against the anti-CD20 arm in nonclinical species overall had lower affinity than antibodies raised against the anti-CD3 arm, and generally lower affinity responses have also been observed against antibodies targeting other B-cell associated antigens (not shown). Interestingly, a majority (75%) of precursor B cells in humans are thought to be self-reactive and are consequently edited during development to avoid autoimmunity (13,14). A similar biological process in non-clinical species may account for the generally poorer anti-CD20 arm responses versus anti-CD3 arm responses. Finally, immunogenicity observed in non-clinical species is not predictive of human responses; this is especially true in hyper-immunized animals used to raise positive control antibodies which typically generate a robust immunogenic response. Importantly, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADA to odronextamab in humans is low (15).",
                "In addition to true NAb, antibodies that compete with odronextamab for the CD20 or CD3 targets could also reduce assay signal, resulting in a false-positive NAb response. These included the bivalent, monospecific parental mAbs as well as commercially available anti-CD20 mAbs that compete for binding such as rituximab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab. Other approved or investigational anti-CD20 mAbs may also generate false-positive response in the NAb assay. We determined there was a statistically significant correlation between the concentration of residual rituximab with NAb signal.",
                "Mitigating interference from remaining systemic anti-CD20 therapies was critically important for assessing NAb responses in clinical study samples. In the odronextamab clinical trial patient population, pre-dose samples from approximately one-third of patients that were examined, generated a false-positive NAb signal, indicating rituximab (or other anti-CD20 therapeutic) concentrations were greater than 2.5 \u03bcg/mL in these patient samples.",
                "Importantly, the interference in the NAb assay due to rituximab was successfully blocked with the addition of antirituximab antibodies. This mitigation strategy was initially demonstrated as a proof-of-concept using rituximab-spiked samples. Notably, the approach also successfully inhibited false-positive NAb signals in baseline clinical study samples, verifying that systemic rituximab was the interfering agent in these patient samples, and the false-positive NAb signal was not due to rituximab ADA cross-reacting with odronextamab (16,17). However, the use of blocking antibodies comes with limitations of use: high concentrations of interfering drug may not be overcome with infinitely high concentrations of blocking mAbs as it was determined, there is a threshold of blocking mAb that can be used successfully in the assay. Alternative mitigation approaches such as immunodepletion would be more complicated in practice than simply incubating with blocking mAbs, as additional procedural steps would be required (e.g., depletion and washing) that could potentially impact other assay parameters such as sensitivity and precision.  18), these patients may be unable to wait for complete drug washout before beginning a new therapy, such as odronextamab. Therefore, a bioanalytical strategy must account for potential interference from prior biologic therapies."

This is especially true in oncology, where mAbs such as rituximab, cetuximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab have been prescribed for decades. In recent years, a new class of immunecheckpoint inhibitors specific for targets including CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 are revolutionizing the field for a range of solid tumor types. Other approved mAbs such as daratumumab, specific for CD38, as well as approved and investigational molecules specific for BCMA and other targets promise to transform treatment of hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma (19).",
                "The treatment paradigm for the most serious cancer types requires successive lines of therapy. Often, the patient is unable to wait for the prior medication to be cleared from circulation before starting a new line of treatment, and consequently, the prior drug remains present systemically. Within the crowded oncology space, the innovator therapy may be used in a new combination with or have overlapping specificity to an approved drug. In addition, some oncology patients may have comorbidities which may be treated with a therapeutic that binds a common target, as in the case with rituximab use in rheumatoid arthritis (20).",
                "The strategy for mitigating bioanalytical assay interference described in this manuscript requires blocking antibodies specific for the prior therapy. This means that for use in the odronextamab NAb assay, samples from patients with recent experience of anti-CD20 therapeutics require antirituximab, anti-ofatumumab, or anti-obinutuzumab blocking antibodies, to prevent generation of a false-positive NAb signal. However, the prior medication history of each patient may be unknown, and a blocking strategy for each approved (or investigational) anti-CD20 therapy may not be feasible in practice. In the absence of a mitigation strategy, samples may only be evaluable for a true neutralizing antibody response after the interfering biotherapeutic is sufficiently Interference from concomitant medications is commonly assessed during bioanalytical method development. Due to the highly specific reagents used in LBAs, there is rarely any impact from other biologics or small molecule drugs (21). However, the overlapping target specificity of prior biotherapeutic medications, especially in the immuno-oncology field, is a new challenge. For example, we recently identified cross-reactivity in a PK assay from anti-PD-1 mAb therapeutics in patient samples using a target-capture LBA (22). Assay interference has also been described in the multiple myeloma area, where therapeutic mAbs interfere with the clinical response assessment of monoclonal M-protein (23). The odronextamab case study described here involving interference in a cell-based NAb assay is another example of the bioanalytical hurdles that must be overcome. Interference in bioanalytical methods will present an ongoing and increasingly frequent challenge, especially when using target-capture immunoassays or similar analytical techniques."
