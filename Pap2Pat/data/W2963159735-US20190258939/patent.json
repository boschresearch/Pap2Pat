    "abstract": "A natural language processing system that includes a sentence selector and a question answering module. The sentence selector receives a question and sentences that are associated with a context. For a question and each sentence, the sentence selector determines a score. A score represents whether the question is answerable with the sentence. Sentence selector then generates a minimum set of sentences from the scores associated with the question and sentences. The question answering module generates an answer for the question from the minimum set of sentences.",

The various data sets are discussed in the \u201cEfficient and Robust Question Answering from Minimal Context over Documents,\u201d Sewon Min, et. al, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Example datasets may be a SQuAD dataset from a large set of Wikipedia articles. The SQuAD dataset may provide a paragraph for each question 170. Another example of a dataset may be a NewsQA dataset that includes a large set of news articles and also provides a paragraph for each question 170. Typically, paragraphs in NewsQA dataset are longer than paragraphs in a SQuAD dataset. Another example of a dataset is a TriviaQA dataset that includes a large set of Wikipedia articles and web documents. In a TriviaQA dataset, each question 170 is given a longer context in the form of multiple documents. In yet another example, a dataset may be an open domain question answering dataset based on SQuAD. In a SQuAD-Open dataset, only the question and the answer may be given, and a model may identify the relevant context from the English Wikipedia articles or Wikipedia articles written in another language. In yet another embodiment, a SQuAD-Adversarial dataset may be another variant of a SQuAD dataset. For example, the SQuAD-Adversarial dataset shares the same training set as SQuAD, but also has an adversarial sentence that is added to each paragraph in a sub set of a development set.

Results of a TF-IDF model against QA system 130 are replicated below in Table 2.
