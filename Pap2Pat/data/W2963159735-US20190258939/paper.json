    "title": "Efficient and Robust Question Answering from Minimal Context over Documents",
    "date": "2018-01-01",
    "abstract": "Neural models for question answering (QA) over documents have achieved significant performance improvements. Although effective, these models do not scale to large corpora due to their complex modeling of interactions between the document and the question. Moreover, recent work has shown that such models are sensitive to adversarial inputs. In this paper, we study the minimal context required to answer the question, and find that most questions in existing datasets can be answered with a small set of sentences. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to feed into the QA model. Our overall system achieves significant reductions in training (up to 15 times) and inference times (up to 13 times), with accuracy comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on SQuAD, NewsQA, TriviaQA and SQuAD-Open. Furthermore, our experimental results and analyses show that our approach is more robust to adversarial inputs.",

                "The task of textual question answering (QA), in which a machine reads a document and answers a question, is an important and challenging problem in natural language processing. Recent progress in performance of QA models has been largely due to the variety of available QA datasets (Richardson et al., 2013;Hermann et al., 2015;Rajpurkar et al., 2016;Trischler et al., 2016;Joshi et al., 2017;Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2017).",
                "Many neural QA models have been proposed for these datasets, the most successful of which tend to leverage coattention or bidirectional attention mechanisms that build codependent representations of the document and the question (Xiong et al., 2018;Seo et al., 2017).",
                "Yet, learning the full context over the document is challenging and inefficient. In particular, when the model is given a long document, or multiple documents, learning the full context is intractably slow and hence difficult to scale to large corpora. In addition, Jia and Liang (2017) show that, given adversarial inputs, such models tend to focus on wrong parts of the context and produce incorrect answers.",
                "In this paper, we aim to develop a QA system that is scalable to large documents as well as robust to adversarial inputs. First, we study the context required to answer the question by sampling examples in the dataset and carefully analyzing them. We find that most questions can be answered using a few sentences, without the consideration of context over entire document. In particular, we observe that on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), 92% of answerable questions can be answered using a single sentence.",
                "Second, inspired by this observation, we propose a sentence selector to select the minimal set of sentences to give to the QA model in order to answer the question. Since the minimum number of sentences depends on the question, our sentence selector chooses a different number of sentences for each question, in contrast with previous models that select a fixed number of sentences. Our sentence selector leverages three simple techniques -weight transfer, data modification and score normalization, which we show to be highly effective on the task of sentence selection.",

For instance, in the last example in Table 1, the question requires the background knowledge that Charles Dickens is an English Victorian author.

Nevertheless, we find that most examples are answerable with one or two sentences -among the 88% of examples that are answerable given the full document, 95% can be answered with one or two sentences."

We train DCN+ (Xiong et al., 2018), one of the state-of-the-art models on SQuAD (details in Section 3.1), on the oracle sentence. The model achieves 83.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the full document and 85.1 F1 when trained and evaluated using the oracle sentence. We analyze 50 randomly sampled examples in which the model fails on exact match (EM) despite using the oracle sentence. We classify these errors into 4 categories, as shown in Table 2. In these examples, we observed that 40% of questions are answerable given the oracle sentence but the model unexpectedly fails to find the answer. 58% are those in which the model's prediction is correct but does not lexically match the groundtruth answer, as shown in the first example in Table 2. 2% are those in which the question is not answerable even given the full document. In addition, we compare predictions by the model trained using the full document (FULL) with the model trained on the oracle sentence (ORACLE). Figure 1 shows the Venn diagram of the questions answered correctly by FULL and ORACLE on SQuAD and NewsQA.

                "Question Answering over Documents There has been rapid progress in the task of question answering (QA) over documents along with vari-   et al., 2015;Trischler et al., 2016), fictional stories (Richardson et al., 2013;Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al., 2017), and textbooks (Lai et al., 2017;Xie et al., 2017). Many neural QA models have successfully addressed these tasks by leveraging coattention or bidirectional attention mechanisms (Xiong et al., 2018;Seo et al., 2017) to model the codependent context over the document and the question. However, Jia and Liang (2017) find that many QA models are sensitive to adversarial inputs.",
                "Recently, researchers have developed largescale QA datasets, which requires answering the question over a large set of documents in a closed (Joshi et al., 2017) or open-domain (Dunn et al., 2017;Berant et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2017;Dhingra et al., 2017). Many models for these datasets either retrieve documents/paragraphs relevant to the question (Chen et al., 2017;Clark and Gardner, 2017;Wang et al., 2018), or leverage simple non-recurrent architectures to make training and inference tractable over large corpora (Swayamdipta et al., 2018;Yu et al., 2018).",
                "Sentence selection The task of selecting sentences that can answer to the question has been studied across several QA datasets (Yang et al., 2015), by modeling relevance between a sentence and the question (Yin et al., 2016;Miller et al., 2016;Min et al., 2017). Several recent works also study joint sentence selection and question answering. Choi et al. (2017) propose a framework that identifies the sentences relevant to the question (property) using simple bag-ofwords representation, then generates the answer from those sentences using recurrent neural networks. Raiman and Miller (2017) cast the task of extractive question answering as a search problem by iteratively selecting the sentences, start position and end position. They are different from our work in that (i) we study of the minimal context required to answer the question, (ii) we choose the minimal context by selecting variable number of sentences for each question, while they use a fixed size of number as a hyperparameter, (iii) our framework is flexible in that it does not require end-to-end training and can be combined with existing QA models, and (iv) they do not show robustness to adversarial inputs."

                "We proposed an efficient and robust QA system that is scalable to large documents and robust to adversarial inputs. First, we studied the minimal context required to answer the question in existing datasets and found that most questions can be answered using a small set of sentences. Second, inspired by this observation, we proposed a sentence selector which selects a minimal set of sentences to answer the question to give to the QA model. We demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our method across five different datasets with varying sizes of source documents. We achieved the training and inference speedup of up to 15\u00d7 and 13\u00d7, respectively, and accuracy comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art. In addition, we showed that our approach is more robust to adversarial inputs."
