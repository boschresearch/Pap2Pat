The FPGA or ASIC is configured to represent one or more pedigree data structures, each structure comprising at least two generations. The device comprises a plurality of logic cells arranged such that one or more of the logic cells model a module of the pedigree data structure, where each module of the pedigree data structure is representative of an individual in a pedigree, input circuitry to receive pedigree data and output circuitry to output processed data; and electrical connections between the logic cells and the input and output circuitry.

                        "Traits or characteristics of an organism are determined by genes. The gene for a particular trait can have two or more different forms, referred to as alleles. Alleles exist at a specific location on a chromosome and are separated from each other during meiosis. For every gene, an individual has two alleles, one inherited from each parent. Haplotypes are a combination of alleles at different markers along the same chromosome that are inherited as a unit. It is highly desirable to deduce, from a pedigree, the allelic or haplotype probability.",
                        "Where the parentage of individuals is known, information from multiple individuals can be combined to form a pedigree data structure. Such structures are highly regular since each individual has two parents regardless of whether the identity of either parent is known. Pedigree data structures have a number of applications in genetics, including the estimation of allelic or haplotype probability in humans and agricultural species, to determine the likelihood for disease transmission, and the estimation of breeding values in agricultural species.",
                        "Efficient sequential algorithms exist for many analysis tasks on pedigree data. Sequential algorithms for general purpose CPU based computers are commonly used, but are inadequate for some tasks on large data sets. For large complex pedigrees with marriage or interbreeding loops sampling based algorithms may be used. Given the large data sets inherent in many pedigrees it is highly desirable that such deduction occur in an efficient manner and improvements in speed are continuously being sought."
