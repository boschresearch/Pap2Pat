    "title": "Use of a Histone Deacetylase Gene OsHDT1 in Enhancing Rice Heterosis",
    "date": "2010-04-29 00:00:00",
    "abstract": "A histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1 which enhances utilization of heterosis in rice is isolated and cloned, said gene consisting of: 1) the DNA sequence of positions 1-894 in SEQ ID NO:1 in the Sequence listing; or 2) a DNA sequence which encodes the same protein as that encoded by the DNA sequence of 1). The histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1 is associated with enhanced utilization of heterosis in rice. When the transgenic plants having no phenotype were crossed with \u201cZhenshan 97A\u201d, the F1 overexpression hybrid plants have obviously earlier flowering period than F1 wild-type hybrid plants. Moreover, the RNAi inhibition hybrid plants have a decreased seed setting rate compared to the negative control hybrid plants, while the parent RNAi inhibition plants and negative control plants shows no evident difference in the trait of seed setting rate. Western blotting revealed that the gene is capable of deacetylating histone, mainly at H4K16 site. In addition, there exist significant differences in the level of histone modification among \u201cMinghui 63\u201d, \u201cZhenshan 97\u201d and \u201cShanyou63\u201d.",

                        "Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, is a phenomenon common in biology that refers to the first filial generation exhibits superior traits to the two parents with different genetic traits (Birchler et al. In search of the molecular basis of heterosis. Plant Cell, 2003, 15: 2236-2239.). Although this phenomenon has been exploited extensively in crop production, research into its mechanism somewhat lags behind. Dominance and overdominance hypotheses are two classical theories regarding the mechanism of heterosis (Hu Jianguang et al., Genetic Basis of Crop Heterosis, Hereditas (Beijing), 1999: 47-50). However, they fail to satisfactorily explain all genetic phenomena. In this case, our laboratory utilized an elite rice hybrid \u201cShanyou 63\u201d to study effects of genes on yield and its components, and suggested that epistasis (an interaction between nonallelic genes) plays a major role in the formation of heterosis as the important genetic basis of heterosis in Shanyou 63 (Yu et al. Importance of epistasis as the genetic basis of heterosis in an elite rice hybrid. Proc Natl Acad Sci, 1997, 94: 9226-9231). In addition, Professor Bao Wenkui proposed a network system hypothesis in which two different gene clusters from the two parents are combined into a new network system in the first filial generation through hybridization, such that the alleles are in an optimal working state to achieve heterosis (Bao Wenkui, Opportunities and Risks: Reflections on Forty Years of Breeding Practice, Plants, 1990: 4-5). Hua Jinping has, to some degree, provided molecular evidence for gene network system using \u201cYongjiu F2\u201d rice population (Hua et al. Single-locus heterotic effects and dominance by dominance interactions can adequately explain the genetic basis of heterosis in an elite rice hybrid. Proc Natl Acad Sci, 2003, 100: 2574-2579).",
                        "Epigenetics relates to changes in gene expression level caused by alterations other than those of gene sequences, e.g. DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodeling etc. A number of studies from plants reveal the correlation of DNA methylation with regulation of gene expression (Meyer et al., 1994). In recent years, studies on the regulation of DNA methylation and transcription level were performed to elucidate the genetic mechanism of heterosis.",
                        "Investigation into the proportions of methylated cytosine in a corn hybrid and its parents revealed a lower degree of methylation in the hybrid than its parents (27.4% for the hybrid compared to 31.4% and 28.3% for its parents), and a significant negative correlation between the activity of gene expression and DNA methylation. Thus, it was suggested that heterosis is achieved by increased gene expression due to hybridization (Tsaftaris A S, and Kafka M. Mechanism of heterosis in crop plants. Journal of Crop Production, 1998, 1: 95-111). However, an opposite result was obtained by study on DNA methylation in a rice hybrid \u201cShanyou 63\u201d and its parents \u201cZhenshan 97\u201d and \u201cMinghui 63\u201d (16.3% for both parents but as high as 18% for the hybrid). The overall degree of DNA methylation in the rice hybrid was irrelevant to its heterosis. Nevertheless, increased or decreased methylation on certain specific sites had a marked effect on heterosis. This analysis result could be confirmed by that of the relationship between differential gene expression and heterosis, and vice versa (Xiong et al. Patterns of cytosine methylation in an elite rice hybrid and its parental lines, detected by a methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism technique. Mol Gen Genet, 1999, 261: 439-446).",
                        "It is obvious that heterosis is in fact the consequence of gene regulation. Histone modification, which is an important aspect of epigenetics, as a means of gene regulation, has an important effect on gene transcription, and thus should be connected with heterosis to some extent. Studies with Arabidopsis thaliana in recent years have revealed that some regulatory genes in the hybrid exhibited some alterations at the level of histone acetylation relative to those in the parents. These alterations would influence the expression of downstream genes, which in turn would result in changes in the physiology and metabolic pathways and hence variation in the phenotypes of the plant (Ni et al. Altered circadian rhythms regulate growth vigour in hybrids and allopolyploids. Nature, 2008).",
                        "With the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of heterosis, the theoretical basis for heterosis is taking shape. Nevertheless, the mechanism of heterosis at the level of chromatin modification is still unclear. The present inventors explored, at the level of histone modification, the molecular basis of rice heterosis by isolation, cloning and genetic transformation of a histone deacetylase gene OsHDT1. Some altered traits were found and analyzed at molecular level, and the linkage between heterosis and epigenetic phenomena has been preliminarily established.",
                        "In searching rice protein sequences in the NCBI database, a histone deacetylase OsHDT1 belonging to rice HD2 family (a histone deacetylase family unique to plants) was found by aligning with Histone deacetylase domain (HDAC Domain). The full-length cDNA for the enzyme has an accession number of AK072845 and a gene ID number of 4339823 (see Table 1). The function of this gene in rice remains unclear."

                        "OsHDT1 gene was verified to be associated with hetereosis in rice. The complete coding sequence of the gene was linked to a corn ubiquitin promoter and transformed into rice. The transformed rice was crossed with a sterile line \u201cZhenshan 97A\u201d (obtained from Jiangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Jiangxi, China). The transgenic hybrid plants had an obviously earlier flowering period than wild-type control hybrid plants; while the hybrid plants obtained from the cross of parent plants into which double stranded inhibitory vectors have been introduced showed markedly decreased seed setting rate relative to wild-type control hybrid plants. Through analysis, it was found that OsHDT1 gene regulates the level of acetylation in the parents and hybrid plants via histone modification, resulting in differences in traits among rice varieties.",

In more specific aspects of this invention enhanced trait is selected from group of enhanced traits consisting of enhanced water use efficiency, increased yield, and enhanced nitrogen use efficiency. In an important aspect of the invention the enhanced trait is enhanced yield including increased yield under non-stress conditions and increased yield under environmental stress conditions. Stress conditions may include, for example, drought, shade, fungal disease, viral disease, bacterial disease, insect infestation, nematode infestation, cold temperature exposure, heat exposure, osmotic stress, reduced nitrogen nutrient availability, reduced phosphorus nutrient availability and high plant density.",

                        "Increased yield of a transgenic plant of the present invention can be measured in a number of ways, including test weight, seed number per plant, seed weight, seed number per unit area (i.e., seeds, or weight of seeds, per acre), bushels per acre, tons per acre, or kilo per hectare. For example, corn yield may be measured as production of shelled corn kernels per unit of production area, for example in bushels per acre or metric tons per hectare, often reported on a moisture adjusted basis, for example at 15.5 percent moisture. Increased yield can be expressed in actual delta bushels per acre compared to control or % change of bushels per acre compared to control. Increased yield may result from improved utilization of key biochemical compounds, such as nitrogen, phosphorous and carbohydrate, or from improved responses to environmental stresses, such as cold, heat, drought, salt, and attack by pests or pathogens. Recombinant DNA used in this invention can also be used to provide plants having improved growth and development, and ultimately increased yield, as the result of modified expression of plant growth regulators or modification of cell cycle or photosynthesis pathways.",

(see Hiei et al., Efficient transformation of rice (Oryza sativa L.) mediated by Agrobacterium and sequence analysis of the boundaries of the T-DNA. Plant J, 1994, 6: 271-282).

                                "(2) The copy numbers in the transgenic plants were determined using Southern blotting (see Lu et al., Localization of pms3, a gene for photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterility, to a 28.4-kb DNA fragment. Mol Genet Genomics, 2005, 273: 507-511). Total DNA was digested overnight at 37\u00b0 C. with suitable endonucleases. The digested fragments were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The probes were labeled by a random primer labeling protocol using isotopic label \u03b1-32P-dCTP. The membrane was prehybridized in a hybridization tube for about 8-10 h. Then the isotopically labeled probes were added and hybridization was continued for 10 h. After hybridization was complete, the hybridized membrane was rinsed twice with 1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at ambient temperature, 5 minutes for the first time and 10 minutes for the second time. Then the membrane was hot-washed twice at 65\u00b0 C. with a membrane washing solution of the same concentration, 10 minutes for each time. After washing, the membrane was placed on a clean filter paper and air dried. Then it was wrapped in a cling film, exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned to read the result. The used hybridization membrane was put into a radiation-proof dedicated device and allowed to naturally decay or washed with a probe washing solution to wash away the probes. The copy numbers were determined using hygromycin primers. The results showed that the PR-8 line had two copies, while other lines had only one copy, as shown in FIG. 2.",
                                "(3) The levels of expression of the target gene in the transgenic plants were determined using Northern blotting. The total RNA used was from leaves at tillering stage. The reagent used for RNA extraction was Trizol extraction kit from Invitrogen, and was used according to manufacturer's instruction. The loading amount for Northern membrane transfer was 15 \u03bcg, and the probes were labeled as described for Southern hybridization. The membrane was prehybridized in a hybridization tube for about 3 h. Then the isotopically labeled probes were added and hybridization was continued for 12 h. After hybridization was complete, the hybridized membrane was rinsed twice with 2\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS at ambient temperature, for 10 minutes each time. Then the membrane was hot-washed once at 65\u00b0 C. with a membrane washing solution containing 0.5\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS for 3-5 minutes. If the hybridization signal was still very strong, the membrane was hot-washed once at 65\u00b0 C. with a membrane washing solution containing 0.1\u00d7SSC, 0.1% SDS for 3 or more minutes until the hybridization signal was suitable. After washing, the membrane was placed on a clean filter paper and air dried. Then it was wrapped in a cling film, exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned to read the result. The used hybridization membrane was put into a radiation-proof dedicated device and allowed to naturally decay or hot-washed with 2\u00d7SSC at about 100\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes to wash away the probes. The probes for OsHDT1 gene used in Northern blotting were the restriction fragments excised from plasmid PU1301-HDT1 using KpnI+PstI.",

                                "As the overexpressing plants had varied flowering time, the present inventors investigated the circadian expression rhythm of the gene according to the present disclosure and other genes associated with flowering time, as well as the difference in levels of expression of these genes in parent and hybrid overexpressing and wild-type plants. This was done as follows. The seeds from \u201cMinghui 63\u201d and \u201cShanyou 63\u201d wild-type and overexpressing plants as well as \u201cZhenshan 97\u201d wild-type plants were germinated. One week later, the young seedlings, which were divided into two groups, were transferred to a bread bin containing soil which was then placed into an artificial climate chamber (Versatile Environmental Test Chamber MLR-351H, SANYO) for cultivation with the following settings: light for 15 h, temperature 30\u00b0 C.; absence of light for 9 h, temperature 25\u00b0 C.; constant humidity of 70%. After cultivation under long sunlight condition for 3 weeks, one groups of growing plants were transferred to short sunlight condition and cultivated with the following settings: light for 9 h, temperature 30\u00b0 C.; absence of light for 15 h, temperature 25\u00b0 C.; constant humidity of 70%. The other groups of growing plants continued to be cultivated under long sunlight condition. After a further cultivation for 2 weeks, samples were taken from each groups of the plants at 4 hours interval for 24 hours. Total RNAs were extracted from the samples and reverse transcribed. The transcription products were subjected to quantitative PCR in a 25 \u03bcL reaction system containing 1.5 \u03bcL of the transcription products, 0.25 \u03bcM of each of left and right primers and 12.5 \u03bcL of SYBR Green Mix (Takara). The reaction was performed on a 7500 real-time quantitative PCR instrument (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instruction of Takara Co. Ltd, with rice actin1 gene (Xue et al., Natural variation in Ghd7 is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice. Nat Genet, 2008, 40: 761-7) as an internal reference for the reaction. The reaction comprised 40 cycles. Each sample was run in triplicate and normalized to the expression level of actin1.",

Results showed that the OsHDT1 gene cloned according to the present disclosure had essentially the same expression pattern in these two rice varieties under long and short sunlight conditions, exhibiting a clear circadian rhythm. In particular, under long sunlight condition, the expression level of OsHDT1 rose continuously during the daytime, reaching a peak at 16:30 (4 hours before dark), followed by continuous decline; while under short sunlight condition, the expression level increased incessantly during the daytime, reaching peak at 20:30 (4 hours after dark), and then fell continuously.",
                                "The expression level rose with light induction, reached a peak three hours after disappearance of light, and then declined, reaching the lowest level at half of an hour after generation of light (the results are as shown in FIGS. 8A and B).

The primers used in PCR for each of the genes are shown in Table 2.",
                                "Results showed that, under long sunlight condition, the peak expression (at 8:30, 4 hours after lighting) of Hd3a in FU was higher than in SY (see FIG. 9B), while for MH63 plants, there was no significant difference in the expression between overexpressing plants and wild-type plants (see FIG. 9A). This was consistent with the phenotypes.",
                                "In FU, Ehd1 had a suddenly increased level of expression upon stop of lighting, which subsequently returned to normal (see FIG. 9D), while in MH63 overexpressing plants, the gene showed no significant difference in expression in comparison to wild-type plants (see FIG. 9C).",
                                "The peak expression (at 16:30, 4 hours before dark) of Hd1 in FU was lower than in SY (see FIG. 9F), while in MH63 plants, although the peak expression of the overexpressing plants was lower than that of wild-type plants, the difference was not as significant (see FIG. 9E).",
                                "OsGI had a similar expression pattern to Hd1, with a lower expression in FU than in SY (see FIG. 9H) and a slightly lower expression in PU than in MH (see FIG. 9G) at 16:30.",
                                "It was therefore believed that OsHDT1 influences the flowering time of rice by inhibiting the expression of genes Hd1 and OsGI and thereby increasing the expression of gene Hd3a. However, as the light cycle regulation pathway begins from Ehd1, the expression patterns of the genes in \u201cMinghui 63\u201d and \u201cShanyou 63\u201d deviated from each other. In particular, OsGI and Hd1 had changed expression in both parent and hybrid overexpressing plants, while Ehd1 and Hd3a only had changed expression in \u201cShanyou 63\u201d overexpressing plants, but not in \u201cMinghui 63\u201d overexpressing plants, which ultimately resulting in the phenomenon that the \u201cMinghui 63\u201d plants had early flowering time but the \u201cShanyou 63\u201d plants did not have this phenotype.",
