                        "Approximately ten percent of the 16 million fractures occurring annually in the United States do not progress to timely union and encounter prolonged healing or nonunion each year. There are two distinct types of fracture nonunion, atrophic and hypertrophic nonunion, characterized by different radiographical observation and biological properties. Development of hypertrophic nonunion is primarily due to inadequate mechanical stability, leading to excessive fracture callus formation, therefore appropriate mobilization and fixation at the fracture site are usually used in clinics to achieve successful outcomes in hypertrophic nonunion patients. In contrast, atrophic nonunion is characterized by limited fracture callus with poor tissue revascularization, likely secondary to perturbation of normal biological cues. Treatment of atrophic nonunion usually involves complex clinical interventions in practice and often requires multiple surgeries. Thus, atrophic non-union results in significant patient disability and increased cost to the health care system. While bone graft surgeries, mechanical stimulation devices, and therapies using growth factors and stem cells have been developed, atrophic nonunion remains a major clinical challenge for orthopedic surgeons.",
                        "A major population affected by atrophic nonunion are patients with inflammatory conditions, e.g., elderly patients, smokers, and diabetic or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In these patients, the fracture risk is increased due to poor bone quality, highlighting the potential deleterious role of chronic systemic inflammation in fracture repair. This can be observed in pre-clinical models. Indeed, TNF\u03b1 transgenic mice had impaired bone quality, including reduced cortical thickness which leads to decreased fracture toughness. Additionally, experiments using the mouse cortical defect model showed that bone regeneration was also significantly reduced in RA mice. Studies from patients and rodents have extensively documented that chronic systemic inflammation activates the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway resulting in elevated expression of IL-\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and other cytokines which impairs the fracture repair process at least partially through negatively affecting angiogenesis. Although pharmacological anti-cytokine therapies have been developed and are highly effective in RA patients, the impact of these agents on fracture healing in patients with inflammatory arthritis is not known. Pre-clinical animal studies showed a positive effect of the TNF\u03b1 inhibitor Infliximab on the restoration of callus formation and biomechanical properties of fractured bone in wild-type rats under chronic inflammatory conditions. In contrast, a human cohort study from ankylosing spondylitis patients demonstrated a negative long-term effect of TNF\u03b1 inhibitor treatment on fracture healing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop molecular-based therapies for fracture nonunion, especially for older patients with chronic inflammatory diseases."

                        "The disclosed method enables the promotion of healing fracture nonunion sites under inflammatory conditions by administering CXCL12 and SPP1 within sustained-release bioscaffolds to the fracture nonunion sites to facilitate bony callus formation and bone union.",
                        "Our findings highlight local delivery of SPP1 and CXCL12 as an important therapeutic option to improve the angiogenesis and treat fracture atrophic nonunion, especially under inflammatory conditions",
                        "During normal fracture repair, chondrocytes and osteoblasts are the primary cells that secrete angiogenic factors, recruiting endothelial cells and facilitating angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. As a key initial step, a re-established vascular network brings oxygen and nutrients to facilitate bone regeneration as well as osteoprogenitors, osteoblasts, and other cells necessary for callus maturation and bone formation. However, under inflammatory conditions, insufficient re-vascularization occurs, leading to atrophic nonunion. Through an unbiased in vitro screen of angiogenic factors, described in the Examples below, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) were found to be the two factors most down-regulated by IL-1\u03b2 treatment, suggesting SPP1 and CXCL12 as potential targets of inflammation in chondrocytes. SPP1 and CXCL12 are both highly expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts during fracture repair and recent rodent studies suggest that SPP1 and CXCL12 contribute to fracture healing through improvement of neovascularization.",
                        "In order to target the angiogenesis process, biodegradable scaffolds capable of continuously releasing SPP1 and CXCL12 locally at the fracture site were developed. As described in the Examples below, sustained delivery of SPP1 and CXCL12 accelerated fracture union in an RA mouse model and restored the biomechanical properties at the fracture site, therefore highlighting this approach as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat atrophic fracture nonunion in patients with inflammatory diseases.",
                        "SPP1 and CXCL12 have been demonstrated as chemokines to stimulate angiogenesis both during normal organ development and under pathological conditions, such as various cancers. SPP1 itself can recruit endothelial cells to form new blood vessels while it can also attract macrophages and function synergistically with other cytokines derived from macrophages to promote angiogenesis. Similarly, CXCL12 recruits CXCR4 positive endothelial cells and facilitates angiogenesis. In regard to fracture healing, it has also been shown that global knockout of either Spp1 or Cxcl12 alone led to angiogenesis defect and impaired fracture healing in mice, implicating the positive role of SPP1 and CXCL12 on angiogenesis and fracture healing. There is increasing evidence that SPP1 and CXCL12 expression is upregulated in various tissues under inflammatory conditions. Particularly in the RA patients, high concentrations of SPP1 and CXCL12 were detected in synovial fluid and both SPP1 and CXCL12 were found overexpressed in RA synovial cells, which in turn leads to excessive blood vessel invasion and synovial joint destruction. However, in contrast to the responses to inflammatory stimuli from synovial cells, SPP1 and CXCL12 expression was specifically reduced in chondrocytes by IL-1\u03b2. In accordance with these in vitro observations, the expression of SPP1 and CXCL12 was also found to decrease in the RA callus. These findings highlight supplementation of SPP1 and CXCL12 as a promising therapeutic approach to treat atrophic nonunion, particularly chronic inflammation-induced nonunion.",
                        "The controlled release of SPP1 and CXCL12 locally via the disclosed PCL scaffold restores angiogenesis and fracture repair in RA mice, as described in the Examples below. In various aspects, the controlled release scaffold provides a potential therapeutic approach to treat impaired angiogenesis and fracture nonunion in patients, especially under inflammatory conditions.",

Typically, using such a system, an agent or composition can be administered in combination with a biodegradable, biocompatible polymeric implant that releases the agent over a controlled period of time at a selected site. Examples of polymeric materials include polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyethylene vinyl acetate, and copolymers and combinations thereof. In addition, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of a therapeutic target, thus requiring only a fraction of a systemic dosage.",

Examples of carrier delivery systems include microspheres, hydrogels, polymeric implants, smart polymeric carriers, and liposomes (see generally, Uchegbu and Schatzlein, eds. (2006) Polymers in Drug Delivery, CRC, ISBN-10: 0849325331). Carrier-based systems for molecular or biomolecular agent delivery can: provide for intracellular delivery; tailor biomolecule/agent release rates; increase the proportion of biomolecule that reaches its site of action; improve the transport of the drug to its site of action; allow colocalized deposition with other agents or excipients; improve the stability of the agent in vivo; prolong the residence time of the agent at its site of action by reducing clearance; decrease the nonspecific delivery of the agent to nontarget tissues; decrease irritation caused by the agent; decrease toxicity due to high initial doses of the agent; alter the immunogenicity of the agent; decrease dosage frequency, improve taste of the product; or improve shelf life of the product.",

Candidate molecules can comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, and usually at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate molecules can comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups.",

Engl. 24, 3943-3948). In contrast, a drug-like compound is generally understood to have a relatively larger scaffold (e.g., molecular weight of about 150 to about 500 kD) with relatively more numerous features (e.g., less than about 10 hydrogen acceptors and/or less than about 8 rotatable bonds; hydrophobicity character xlogP of less than about 5) (see e.g., Lipinski (2000) J. Pharm. Tox. Methods 44, 235-249). Initial screening can be performed with lead-like compounds.",
                        "When designing a lead from spatial orientation data, it can be useful to understand that certain molecular structures are characterized as being \u201cdrug-like\u201d. Such characterization can be based on a set of empirically recognized qualities derived by comparing similarities across the breadth of known drugs within the pharmacopoeia. While it is not required for drugs to meet all, or even any, of these characterizations, it is far more likely for a drug candidate to meet with clinical successful if it is drug-like.",

While these rules generally relate to oral absorption and are used to predict bioavailability of compound during lead optimization, they can serve as effective guidelines for constructing a lead molecule during rational drug design efforts such as may be accomplished by using the methods of the present disclosure.",
                        "The four \u201crules of five\u201d state that a candidate drug-like compound should have at least three of the following characteristics: (i) a weight less than 500 Daltons; (ii) a log of P less than 5; (iii) no more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (expressed as the sum of OH and NH groups); and (iv) no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (the sum of N and O atoms).

                                "Despite the growing knowledge of atrophic nonunion from animal models, fracture nonunion remains an exceedingly challenging clinical problem with limited and mainly invasive therapeutic interventions. To date, the atrophic nonunion models available for mechanistic and therapeutic studies primarily rely on critical size bone defect and removal of periosteum, which are particularly valuable to delineate the effect of periosteum tissue and progenitor cell differentiation on disease initiation and progression. Nevertheless, these animal models lack clinical relevance and rarely reflect the clinical scenario, since atrophic nonunion is more prevalent in patients experiencing chronic inflammatory conditions, including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).",
                                "The rising prevalence of inflammatory disease world-wide, especially RA, is associated with debilitating co-morbidities and clinical complications, including delayed fracture union and nonunions. In order to examine the effect of inflammation/RA on the fracture repair, we generated the RA mice via repeated K/B\u00d7N serum intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration every 5 days to maintain the systemic inflammation. Given the fact that the transcription factor NF-\u03baB is the principal mediator and surrogate of inflammatory responses, we examined its activity using NF-\u03baB/RelA-Luc reporter mice subjected to RA condition.",
                                "Consistent with the expected increase in inflammation, we confirmed that the RA mice displayed significantly higher luciferase activity, especially in limbs, compared to the control group (FIG. 7A). Importantly, elevated inflammation peaked at 10 days after serum administration and was maintained at least up to 15 days (FIG. 7B). Clinical reports and rodent studies have shown that elevated inflammatory cytokines are the major factors contributing to RA- related co-morbidities. Indeed, we show that mRNA expression levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including ll1\u03b2, ll6, ll10, and Tnfa, were significantly elevated in the fracture callus of the RA mice (FIG. 8). Importantly, compared to the control mice, the RA mice developed impaired fracture repair with diminished cartilaginous and bony callus formation reflected by histological analyses of 10 and 14 days post-fracture (dpf) tibae (FIG. 1A). Consistent with histology, quantitative histomorphometry confirmed minimal cartilage template and newly formed woven bone in 10 and 14 dpf RA callus (FIGS. 1B and 1C).",
                                "We then performed microCT to further examine the mineralized callus in the control and RA mice. We found a gradual increase in new bone formation around the fracture area by 14 dpf in the control mice. The fracture gap in the control mice was closed at 21 dpf with robust bone formation and complete healing. In contrast, the fracture gap persisted until 21 dpf in the RA mice as shown by microCT, with significantly reduced newly formed bone tissue and bone volume over total volume (BV/TV) (FIGS. 1D, 1E, and 9). Notably, Collagen III positive fibrotic tissue was present in the center of RA fracture callus instead of woven bone tissue in the control fracture, suggesting an atrophic nonunion fracture in the RA mice (FIG. 1F).",
                                "Finally, we performed the torsion testing to evaluate the mechanical properties of 28 dpf tibae as the ultimate indication of fracture repair outcome in the control and RA mice. Compared to the control fractured tibae, the RA fractured tibae displayed significantly lower maximum torque (77% reduction) with a larger displacement angle, indicating poor bone strength and rigidity of newly formed bone in the RA mice (FIG. 1G). Altogether, these data confirmed that under RA condition, mice displayed systemic inflammation mediated by cytokines, and developed fracture nonunion.",
                                "The results of these experiments demonstrated the development of atrophic nonunion of bone fractures under the chronic inflammation induced by K/B\u00d7N serum in the RA mouse model with an absence of fracture callus, as well as diminished angiogenesis. Despite a large amount of evidence on the role of the NF-\u03baB pathway in fracture studies, the mechanisms by which pathologic inflammation adversely affects angiogenesis during fracture healing were previously unknown. Specifically, NF-\u03bab reporter mice confirmed that elevated inflammation was exhibited in the RA mice particularly in the hind limbs that was maintained at least up to 15 days. The expression of inflammatory factors was also induced locally in the fracture callus of RA mice.",
                                "Furthermore, the RA mice displayed (a) no fracture callus formation, (b) fibrotic scar tissue within the fracture, (c) diminished angiogenesis, and (d) poor mechanical performance, all of which are consistent with clinical manifestations of the atrophic nonunion patients. The results of these experiments demonstrated the utility of the mouse RA nonunion model with high clinical relevance. The mouse RA nonunion model provided a useful tool to study the pathology of atrophic nonunion under inflammation.",
                                "**Example 2: Inflammation Reduces Expression of Angiogenic Factors and Impairs Angiogenesis in Mice**",
                                "To study the cellular and molecular basis of the negative impact of inflammation on angiogenesis in bone fracture healing, the following experiments were conducted using the mouse RA nonunion model described above.",
                                "Clinical studies and rodent models have established that the defect of vascularization coincides with fracture nonunion, especially under inflammatory conditions, such as RA. Consistent with these reports, we observed that the control mice formed blood vessels at 10 dpf, the peak angiogenic time point in murine fracture healing. In contrast, the RA mice had diminished angiogenesis and poor angiogenic connectivity in 10dpf callus tissues (FIG. 2A). Quantification confirmed significantly fewer blood vessels in the RA fracture callus at 10 dpf (FIG. 2B).",
                                "We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect Endomucin positive blood vessels in fracture callus. Similar to the angiography results, IHC revealed almost nondetectable blood vessels in the RA fracture callus, but abundant blood vessels were observed in 10 dpf control fracture callus (FIGS. 2C and 2D). These data indicate that systemic inflammation has adverse effects on the expression of angiogenic factors, leading to reduced angiogenesis during fracture repair. Since chondrocytes and osteoblasts are the primary cells that secrete angiogenic factors in fracture callus to stimulate blood vessel formation, we isolated primary chondrocytes and osteoblasts and treated them with IL-1\u03b2 in vitro for 72 hours to examine the effect of inflammation on the production of angiogeic factors by these cells. A protein array (53 angiogenic factors) was used to determine the presence of angiogenic mediators in the culture supernatant from chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. Inflammation significantly reduced the expression of angiogenic factors in chondrocytes, including secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), but induced the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CXCL4), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (FIGS. 2E and 2F).",
                                "Surprisingly, expression of angiogenic factors from osteoblasts was minimally altered by IL-1\u03b2 treatment (FIG. 10A). The expression of SPP1, VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and placental growth factor 2 (PIGF-2) was even significantly increased under IL-1\u03b2 treatment in primary osteoblasts (FIG. 10B). These data highlight the key role of chondrocytes in angiogenesis defect observed in RA mice during fracture nonunion. Since other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 have been shown up-regulated in RA fracture callus (FIG. 8), we also treated primary chondrocytes with IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. Similar to the effect of IL-1\u03b2, treatments of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 could also reduce the protein expression of SPP1 and CXCL12 in chondrocytes (FIG. 11).",
                                "Although the failure of bone healing is due to the interplay of multiple components, including defects of growth factors, progenitor cells, and mechanical factors, lack of blood supply has been long believed as an essential trigger to fracture healing defect, particularly atrophic nonunion. Clinical studies over the past decade revealed a three-fold increase in the nonunion rate in patients with ischemic injuries to tibia fracture compared to the average fracture patients. More importantly, fracture nonunion can be significantly improved by reconstruction of the vascular structure and restoration of blood supply, suggesting the pivotal role of angiogenesis on the development of fracture nonunion.",
                                "Recent studies have implicated that chondrocytes and osteoblasts are two major cell sources secreting angiogenic factors to restore the blood supply via angiogenesis during the initial fracture repair process. Restored blood supply then brings growth factors and oxygen to facilitate bony callus formation through chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of progenitor cells, and meanwhile brings osteoclasts to remodel the callus to regain the normal bone structure. Despite these findings, the underlying mechanism by which impaired angiogenesis results in atrophic nonunion remains largely unknown, especially under pathological inflammation conditions.",
                                "We comprehensively screened the angiogenic factors secreted from chondrocytes and osteoblasts under IL-1\u03b2 treatment. Surprisingly, unlike chondrocytes, IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of the angiogenic factors in osteoblasts. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 significantly induced VEGF expression in both chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Several studies have demonstrated that VEGF and VEGF signaling are the potent angiogenic factor and pathway to stimulate vessel formation and fracture repair in mice. However, our in vivo finding is that the RA mice developed impaired angiogenesis due to inflammation, which leads us to speculate that the reduced angiogenic factors, but not VEGF, likely are the direct downstream targets mediating the reduced angiogenesis observed in vivo. More importantly, SPP1 and CXCL12 were identified as two angiogenic factors most reduced in IL-1\u03b2 treated chondrocytes. Their physiologic importance was evident in HUVEC experiments that showed that the addition of SPP1 and CXCL12 restored angiogenic defect present in supernatants harvested from IL-1\u03b2 treated chondrocyte cultures. These findings indicated that chondrocytes are the target cells that mediate the angiogenic defect observed in the RA mice and that SPP1 and CXCL12 are potential downstream targets of inflammation in chondrocytes.",
                                "The results of these experiments uncovered several key findings that highlight a translational implication to treat atrophic nonunion. Through the screening of angiogenic factors, in vitro angiogenesis assays, and the RA fracture nonunion model, we demonstrated that inflammation reduced the expression of SPP1 and CXCL12 in chondrocytes and lead to diminished angiogenesis and atrophic nonunion in the RA mouse model.",

                                "In Example 2 above, SPP1 was demonstrated to be the most reduced factor by IL-1\u03b2 and CXCL12, which was the most abundantly expressed factor in chondrocytes, was also demonstrated to be significantly reduced, we focused on these two angiogenic factors to examine whether SPP1 and CXCL12 were the downstream targets of inflammation that mediate the angiogenic defect. As described below, we confirmed that Spp1 and Cxcl12 gene expression was decreased in 10 dpf RA fracture callus compared to the control callus (FIG. 3A), in agreement with the decreased protein expression. IHC performed on 10 dpf fractured tissue revealed abundant expression of SPP1 and CXCL12 in the control fracture callus, yet an almost non-detectable expression of SPP1 and CXCL12 in the RA fracture callus (FIG. 3B), confirming the down-regulation of SPP1 and CXCL12 by inflammation in the context of fracture repair under RA conditions.",
                                "To confirm a physiological effect of inflammation on chondrocyte regulation of angiogenesis, we examined in vitro angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) using culture medium supernatants collected from primary chondrocytes treated with vehicle (control) or IL-1\u03b2 (FIGS. 3C, 3D, and 3E). Consistent with our in vivo angiogenesis findings, the control culture supernatants from vehicle-treated chondrocytes had robust cell migration as well as an abundance of well-developed vessel tubes in vitro. In contrast, a significant reduction of HUVEC migration, tube number, and tube length was observed in the presence of culture supernatant from IL-1\u03b2-treated chondrocytes. This observation was not related to the continued presence of IL-1\u03b2 in the supernatant since the angiogenic factors protein array results confirmed that there was no IL-1\u03b2 left in the culture medium after 72 hours of IL-1\u03b2 treatment (FIG. 2E). Additionally, compared to culture medium from vehicle-treated chondrocytes, culture medium from IL-1\u03b2-treated chondrocytes did not induce any apparent difference in HUVEC cell proliferation and apoptosis (FIG. 12), suggesting decreased angiogenic capacity of the culture medium was at least partially attributed to reduced SPP1 and CXCL12, but not dysfunction of HUVEC itself.",
                                "We applied 500 ng/ml of SPP1 and 100 ng/ml of CXCL12 to the chondrocyte culture medium and performed HUVEC angiogenesis assays. As expected, administration of SPP1 and CXCL12 individually, or in combination, to culture medium from vehicle-treated chondrocytes resulted in induction of HUVEC migration and tube formation. More importantly, exogenous SPP1 and CXCL12 administration restored angiogenic capacity, as reflected by increased cell migration, tube number and tube length under culture medium from IL-1\u03b2 treated chondrocytes. We also observed that combined administration of SPP1 and CXCL12 achieved the most profound effect on the restoration of HUVEC in vitro angiogenesis. These data, together with the murine RA fracture nonunion model results described above, identified the reduction of SPP1 and CXCL12 as the molecular basis of the negative impact of inflammation on angiogenesis.",
                                "The results of these experiments demonstrated that the administration of exogenous SPP1 and CXCL12 represents a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of fracture nonunion under inflammatory conditions.

The sustained-release formulation made use of a polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold. PCL is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved biodegradable polymer for tissue engineering applications.",
                                "An electrospinning and electrospraying system was used to fabricate PCL scaffolds by simultaneously electrospinning PCL fibers and electrospraying poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres loaded with SPP1 (100 \u03bcg/ml) and/or CXCL12 (20 \u03bcg/ml) (FIG. 4A).",

The fluorescent images shown in FIG. 4B confirmed that the microspheres assumed a core-shell structure with PLGA as the shell and SPP1 or CXCL12 as the core (FIG. 4B).",

The PCL scaffold was formed by interlaced fibers and the microspheres with a diameter of about 5 \u03bcm were distributed uniformly in the scaffolds (FIG. 4C). Mechanical testing of the scaffold was conducted as described above. The scaffolds exhibited a tensile strength of 28.8 MPa and Young's modulus of 111.5 MPa (FIG. 13).",

According to the ELISA assays of the collected medium, SPP1 and CXCL12 exhibited a two-stage release pattern (FIG. 4D). Both compounds displayed burst release in the first three days followed by a controlled slow release until day 28. The release of SPP1 and CXCL12 from the scaffold loaded with both SPP1 and CXCL12 was slower than the corresponding release profiles from the scaffolds loaded with SPP1 only or CXCL12 only (FIG. 4D).",

                                "Since the RA mice exhibited a systemic inflammatory environment, particularly the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the fracture sites (FIG. 8), the following experiments were conducted to examine whether SPP1 and CXCL12 released from the scaffolds described above promoted HUVEC angiogenic capacity under the inflammatory conditions. We mimicked the scenario when the scaffold was implanted at the fracture site by placing the collagen gel on the top of PCL scaffolds loaded with SPP1 and/or CXCL12 and then culturing CM-Dil dye-labeled HUVEC on the collagen gel under the control or inflammatory conditions (FIG. 5A). The migration of HUVEC cells on the collagen gel was then examined by confocal microscopy. As expected, IL-1\u03b2 treatment significantly reduced the HUVEC migration, particularly in the deep zone from 50 \u03bcm to 110 \u03bcm from the top surface (FIG. 5B). However, growth factors substantially promoted the migration under IL-1\u03b2 treatment (FIG. 5B). The SPP1 released from the scaffold loaded with SPP1 alone more greatly promoted HUVEC migration than the CXCL12 released from the scaffold loaded with CXCL12 alone. The greatest cell migration was found in the group with combined SPP1 and CXCL12 release, especially in the deep zone up to 110 \u03bcm from the top surface (FIG. 5B).",
                                "In addition to cell migration, we also examined the tube formation based on the lumens formed in the collagen gel, particularly focused on the area with a majority of HUVEC cells. IL-1\u03b2 treatment significantly reduced the tube formation as reflected by decreased lumen formation in the collagen gel, in the top surface (10 \u03bcm) and deep zone (50 \u03bcm), although no HUVEC migration difference was observed in the surface under IL-1\u03b2 treatment. Importantly, the lumen formation was restored in the groups where scaffolds were loaded with SPP1 and CXCL12, even under inflammatory conditions. The lumen density in the group with only CXCL12 release was significantly higher than the group with only SPP1 release. The group with both SPP1 and CXCL12 had significantly greater lumen density than the group with CXCL12 release alone in both surface area and deep zone (FIGS. 5C and 5D).",
                                "The results of these experiments confirmed that SPP1 and CXCL12 were gradually released for 4 weeks from the scaffolds, which would potentially benefit angiogenesis and inflammatory bone fracture healing.",
                                "**Example 6: Controlled Release of Spp1 and Cxcl12 Restores Angiogenesis and Fracture Union in the RA Mice**",
                                "To characterize the effects of treatment using the scaffold composition described above in vivo, the following experiments were conducted. We applied the scaffolds with SPP1 (100 \u03bcg/ml) and/or CXCL12 (20 \u03bcg/ml) to treat fracture nonunion in the RA mice described above. A 2-mm thickness of the scaffold described above was wrapped around the fractured bone of the RA mice immediately after the fracture procedure (FIG. 6A). Vascular structure and fracture healing process were evaluated 10 days after application of scaffolds by microCT and histology, respectively. Similar to the RA mice, diminished angiogenesis was observed at 10 dpf callus tissue applied with PCL scaffold without growth factors under the systemic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, PCL scaffold loaded with SPP1 and/or CXCL12 significantly induced angiogenic response in 10 dpf callus and resulted in the formation of more blood vessels under the RA condition (FIGS. 14A, 14B, 6B, and 6C). Consistent with the observation from in vitro angiogenesis assays, SPP1 and CXCL12 in combination achieved the most effect on the restoration of blood vessel formation in the RA mice, compared to the individual SPP1 and CXCL12 treatment.",
                                "We also performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect Endomucin positive blood vessels in 10 dpf fracture callus and revealed significantly more blood vessels in the RA fracture callus applied with PCL scaffold containing both SPP1 and CXCL12 (FIGS. 6D and 6E). More importantly, coincident with the restoration of blood vessels in fracture callus, newly formed woven bone was also observed in the RA mice treated with SPP1 and CXCL12 via PCL scaffold. Individual SPP1 and CXCL12 treatment similarly induced more woven bone (8 folds increase) in the adjacent region of fracture at 10 dpf (FIGS. 14C and 14D). Application of SPP1 and CXCL12 together increased woven bone in 10 dpf callus by 25 folds. Notably, the newly formed bone replaced the fibrotic tissue and unified the fracture nonunion in the RA mice after 10 days of local treatment with SPP1 and CXCL12 (FIGS. 6F and 6G). Finally, we measured the bone biomechanical properties by the torsion test and found that the maximum bone strength was significantly restored by 28 dpf in the RA mice treated with SPP1 and CXCL12 (FIG. 6H). Hence, these findings strongly suggest that local release with SPP1 and CXCL12 via PCL scaffold presents an effective therapeutic approach to treat impaired angiogenesis and fracture nonunion under inflammatory conditions.",
                                "In these experiments, the biodegradable scaffold loaded with SPP1 and CXCL12 displayed a beneficial effect on angiogenesis and fracture repair in mice despite the presence of inflammation. These findings strongly suggested that sustained release of SPP1 and CXCL12 represents an effective therapeutic approach to treat impaired angiogenesis and fracture nonunion under inflammatory conditions.",
                                "Finally, as proof of concept that administration of SPP1 and CXCL12 can restore angiogenesis and be beneficial for atrophic nonunion fracture healing, we applied the PCL scaffold with SPP1 and CXCL12 to the fracture site in the RA mice. It is well established that excessive SPP1 and CXCL12 are associated with cancer angiogenesis, metastasis, and malignancy. In addition, excessive angiogenesis mediated by SPP1 and CXCL12 in the synovium may exacerbate the joint destruction in RA patients. Therefore, in order to avoid potential side effects, we engineered a PCL scaffold for the sustained release of SPP1 and CXCL12 locally in the fracture site. PCL scaffold is an FDA approved biodegradable material and has been used in bone regeneration in animals. The fabricated scaffolds were fibrous, mimicking the morphology of the extracellular matrix in the periosteum tissue. Notably, the scaffolds had comparable Young's modulus and tensile strength to the periosteum tissue. As expected, treatment with SPP1 or CXCL12 alone showed beneficial effects on angiogenesis and new bone formation in RA callus. More importantly, consistent with in vitro findings, the combination of SPP1 and CXCL12 exhibited a synergistic effect in vivo, i.e., significantly induced angiogenesis greater than either factor alone. Surprisingly, both factors together also induced bony callus formation and fracture union at 10 days post-fracture in the RA mice. While individual delivery of SPP1 or CXCL12 treatment restored the fracture repair in the RA mice with cartilage callus and with areas of new bone formation at 10 dpf fracture, the combination treatment gave rise to a more mature bony callus without residual cartilage, suggesting the accelerated fracture healing. The synergistic effect is likely due to the restoration of endomucin positive blood vessels by SPP1 and CXCL12, given the evidence that endomucin positive type H vessel is the most important vessel facilitating fracture callus ossification and union. In addition, it has been shown that SPP1 can signal through multiple integrins to facilitate vessel formation through activation of PI3K and MAP kinase pathways in endothelial cells. Similarly, CXCL12 can also activate the MAP kinase pathway through \u03b2-arrestin. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that SPP1 and CXCL12 synergistically induce angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo under inflammatory conditions through activation of MAP kinase pathways in endothelial cells. Moreover, SPP1 is predominantly synthesized by osteoblasts, therefore it is possible that increased vessel formation and bone formation is achieved through an SPP1 mediated positive feedback loop. CXCL12 can also induce osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, therefore accelerating bony callus formation in mice."
