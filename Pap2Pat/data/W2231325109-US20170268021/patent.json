                        "Selective degeneration of functional neurons is a key pathogenic event in many neurodegenerative disorders. Cell replacement through transplantation of stem/progenitor cells represents a particularly promising therapeutic strategy for these diseases. One of the most sought after diseases for cell replacement is Parkinson's disease (PD), which is a prototypical illness characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and decreased DA innervation in the striatum1,2. Recent breakthroughs in stem cell biology have established the feasibility of directly reprogramming cells of one lineage into another, e.g., neurons, by introducing crucial cell-fate determinants3,4. As a result of those advances, induced neurons5-9 and induced neural stem cells (iNPCs)10-13 have been successfully generated, and studies show that these cells hold therapeutic benefits. Direct reprogramming represents an important direction to obtain safe and less controversial cell sources for PD treatment. However, the low yield and non-proliferative nature of dopaminergic neurons derived from direct reprogramming limits broad application. Multipotent neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPC), including iNPCs that give rise to all types of neural cells, may increase the yield of engraftable cells; however, specific and efficient induction of homogeneous DA neurons from NPCs/iNPCs remains a significant challenge. NSCs/NPCs often respond poorly to pre-patterning morphogens with low differentiation efficiency for specific neuronal subtypes, and are prone to a glial-restricted state14. Moreover, grafted NSCs/NPCs are more likely to terminally differentiate into astrocytes rather than functional neurons in response to injury15,16. Therefore, dopaminergic neuronal-lineage restricted precursors that hold great potential for DA neuronal differentiation are highly desirable for experimental PD treatment.",
                        "Thus, a need exists for dopaminergic precursors, in particularly in vitro induced dopaminergic precursors (iDP). Studies have previously revealed that Brn2/Brn4 and Sox2 are critical for the direct conversion of fibroblasts into induced neural progenitors9,10,13,17. Strategically, various groups have been working on the direct reprogramming of somatic cells into region-specific iNPCs as well as subtype-specific iNPCs by expressing defined transcript factors in addition to Brn2/Brn4 and Sox210,18. The factors that directly reprogram somatic cells into neuronal lineage-restricted progenitors have been expanded to the combination of Brn2/Brn4 and Sox2 with c-Myc19. In addition, in the presence of Brn2 and Sox2, FoxG1, a transcription factor that is predominantly expressed in the forebrain, contributes to the acquisition of forebrain identity in iNPCs10. In contrast, the midbrain DA neurons that originated from the floor plate cells in the mesencephalon are critically regulated by transcriptional determinants such as Foxa220-22. Furthermore, the development of DA neurons depends not only on initial Sonic hedgehog (SHH)/Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and Wnt1 signaling pathway for the dopaminergic progenitors, but also on the cooperation of SHH-Foxa2 and Wnt1-Lmx1\u03b1 pathways23. However, before the discovery herein, no complete panel of transcription factors have been identified to be able to transdifferentiate somatic cells into iDPs in vitro. In contrast, the derivation of engraftable DPs from human pluripotent stem cells has proven difficult due to low differentiation efficiency of DA neurons and primary DPs are not readily available."

                        "Compositions and methods for transdifferentiation of a somatic cell, e.g., a fibroblast to a dopaminergic precursor (DP) are disclosed herein. In one aspect, it was surprisingly discovered, for the first time in vitro, that the specification of midbrain identity and dopaminergic neural fate can be achieved by the ectopic expression of Brn2 (and/or Brn4) and Sox2 with Foxa2 (and/or Lmx1a) during the direct reprogramming of terminally differentiated cells. It is particularly unexpected that a high percentage (e.g., more than 80% or more than 90%) of the cells can be transdifferentiated into iDPs in cells ectopically expressing Brn2, Sox2 and Foxa2. In some embodiments, the addition of Foxa2 (and/or Lmx1a) into the reprogramming procedure initiated by Brn2 (and/or Brn4) and Sox2 successfully converts adult skin fibroblasts into neural progenitors with a midbrain identity and selective dopaminergic differentiation potential. As a result, the induced DPs (iDPs) are dopaminergic neuronal-restricted in vitro and in vivo, and do not form tumors or neural overgrowths in the brain. Moreover, grafted iDPs in the striatum of MPTP mouse model differentiated terminally into DA neurons rather than astrocytes, and functionally alleviate PD symptoms. Furthermore, L-Myc expression can be engineered in the iDPs under the control of an inducer, e.g., doxycycline (Dox), such that the iDPs can be safely expanded to the desired yield for transplantation, providing a useful cell source for PD treatment.",
                        "In some embodiments, Brn2 (and/or Brn4), Sox2 and Foxa2 (and/or Lmx1a ) are the master transcription factors that can be used to induce transdifferentiation of a somatic cell to iDP by, e.g., ectopically expressing the master transcription factors in the somatic cell. The resulting iDPs not only exhibit the properties of primary dopaminergic progenitors, but also exclusively possess the dopaminergic neuronal lineage-restricted potential. The iDPs can be used in a cell or tissue replacement therapy for the treatment of a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression and dementia. In some embodiments, autologous somatic cells obtained from a patient are subject to transdifferentiation, so that the resulting cells can be transplanted back to the same patient to minimize immune response that might otherwise be mounted against the cells and to avoid the potential need for immunosuppression.",
                        "Some of the advantages of the present disclosure over the currently available technologies include the following:",
                        "1. The ectopic expression of certain transcription factors disclosed herein can lead to exclusive dopaminergic neuronal lineage-restricted progenitors that do not differentiate into glial cells. In contrast, most of the existing stem cells have been found to differentiate into glial cells. Thus, the iDPs of the present disclosure provide increased therapeutic efficiency compared to other technologies.",
                        "2. Unlike other precursors, the differentiation of the iDPs of the present disclosure is, surprisingly, independent of morphogens such as SHH and FGF8. In contrast, other precursors studied to date all require morphogens to induce differentiation.",
                        "3. The iDPs disclosed herein have higher potential and efficiency of dopaminergic neuron generation (e.g., more than 80% or more than 90%), compared to currently available technologies which only range from 5% to 60%.",
                        "4. The iDPs can be further modified (e.g., by transducing L-Myc expression) so as to have limited proliferation, reducing tumorigenicity after cell transplantation."

During their migration, they start to express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, and eventually differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. A group of the dopaminergic neurons are involved in control of voluntary movement and are severely affected in Parkinson's disease. Another group of the dopaminergic neurons are involved in regulation of emotion-related behavior and are affected in depression and schizophrenia.

For example, the ability of a variant of a Brn2, Brn4, Sox2, Foxa2 and/or Lmx1a polypeptide to convert a somatic cell, e.g., fibroblast to an iDP can be assessed using the assays as disclose herein. Other convenient assays include measuring the ability to activate transcription of a reporter construct containing a Brn2, Brn4, Sox2, Foxa2 and/or Lmx1a variant operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a detectable marker such as florescent protein or luciferase. One assay involves determining whether the Brn2, Brn4, Sox2, Foxa2 and/or Lmx1a variant induces a somatic cell, e.g., fibroblast to become an iDP cell or express markers of a DP cell or exhibit functional characteristics of a DP cell as disclosed herein. Determination of such expression of DP markers can be determined using any suitable method, e.g., immunoblotting or real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Such assays may readily be adapted to identify or confirm activity of agents that directly convert a somatic cell, e.g., fibroblast to an iDP cell. In certain embodiments of the disclosure a functional variant or fragment has at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more of the activity of the full length wild type polypeptide.",

                                "Degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons is a key pathological event of Parkinson's disease (PD). Limited adult dopaminergic neurogenesis has led to novel therapeutic strategies such as transplantation of dopaminergic precursors (DPs). However, this strategy is currently restrained by a lack of cell source, the tendency for the DPs to become a glial-restricted state, and the tumor formation after transplantation. Here, we demonstrate the direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts into induced DPs (iDPs) by ectopic expression of Brn2, Sox2 and Foxa2. Besides expression with neural progenitor markers and midbrain genes including Corin, Otx2 and Lmx1a, the iDPs were restricted to dopaminergic neuronal lineage upon differentiation. After transplantation into MPTP-lesioned mice, iDPs differentiated into DA neurons, functionally alleviated the motor deficits, and reduced the loss of striatal DA neuronal axonal termini. Importantly, no iDPs-derived astroctyes and neoplasia were detected in mouse brains after transplantation. We propose that the iDPs from direct reprogramming provides a safe and efficient cell source for PD treatment.",
                                "Foxa2 Cooperated with Brn2 and Sox2 to Convert Mouse Fibroblasts into Neural Progenitors with Midbrain Identity",
                                "Our initial studies have shown that skin fibroblasts can be successfully converted into induced neural progenitors (5F-iNPCs) by a set of transcription factors, including Brn2, Sox2, TLX, Bmi1 and c-Myc13. However, the dopaminergic differentiation efficiency of 5F-iNPCs in response to SHH/FGF8 stimulation remains low (<5%). The direct reprogramming of somatic cells into region-specific iNPCs as well as subtype-specific iNPCs by overexpression of defined transcript factors has become our strategy. It has been suggested that Foxa2 and Lmx1a are the major mediators of SHH and Wnt1 signaling in midbrain DA neuron development, respectively23. The role of these factors in cellular reprogramming remains unclear. We utilized a Tet-On/Off system to express Foxa2 and Lmx1a in 5F-iNPCs. The cells that successfully incorporated Foxa2 and Lmx1a genes were further screened with the addition of antibiotics puromycin and neomycin in the culture (FIG. 8A). In the presence of Dox, the ectopic expressions of Foxa2 and Lmx1a were induced (FIG. 8B). As expected, both Foxa2- and Lmx1a-expression significantly reduced the proliferation of 5F-iNPCs (FIG. 8C). Furthermore, the differentiation-related genes, including Ngn2 and Gpm6a for neuronal lineage and Glast for glial lineage, were significantly up-regulated. In contrast, the neural stem cell makers, such as CD133 and Nestin, were down-regulated (FIG. 8D). Interestingly, the expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and several key factors responsible for midbrain dopaminergic neuron development in 5F-iNPCs were dramatically increased in response to Foxa2 and Lmx1a overexpression (FIG. 8E), suggesting that both Foxa2 and Lmx1a play a positive role in the determination of DA neuronal fate. The effect of Foxa2 and Lmx1a on DA neuronal fate was further confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Foxa2 and Lmx1a overexpression did not affect astrocyte differentiation and neuronal maturation (FIG. 9A). Under neuronal differentiation conditions with SHH/FGF8, the population of TH+ cells was significantly increased following the overexpression of Foxa2 and Lmx1a (FIG. 9B, left panel). The percentage of TH+ cells to total MAP2+ cells was about 10-fold higher than those 5F-iNPCs without Foxa2 and Lmx1a overexpression (FIG. 9B, right panel). Together, these data suggested that Foxa2 may cooperate with Lmx1a to promote the mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron identity in iNPCs, without affecting the neuronal maturation and astrogliogenesis.",
                                "Although the specification and maturation of mesencephalic floor plate-originated midbrain DA neurons are primarily regulated by both Foxa2 and Lmx1a/b24,25, recent evidence has demonstrated that Foxa2 can positively regulate Lmx1a/b and inhibit the expression of Nkx2.2 in neural progenitors26. This indicates that Foxa2 alone may suffice for the specification of mesencephalic dopaminergic progenitor identity. We examined this idea by determining the role of Foxa2, along with two known reprogramming factors Brn2 and Sox2, in the direct conversion of somatic cells into neural progenitors. We isolated and cultured adult dermal fibroblasts (SF) from Nestin-EGFP transgenic mice (E/Nestin: EGFP). The fibroblasts were infected with retroviruses encoding Brn2, Sox2 and Foxa2 (BSF) following a schematic procedure (FIG. 1A). The kinetics of induced neural progenitors was monitored with the EGFP in the culture. Seven days after retroviral infections, we observed EGFP positive cells in culture, and at 14 days post-infection, we observed colony formation (FIG. 1B). Seven colonies were obtained and only two were confirmed to be expandable clones after subculture. Both of the expandable clones showed identical properties (data not shown). Compared to the primary cortical neural progenitor cells (WT-NPCs), the resulting cells (named iDPs) retained high expression levels of Foxa2, Brn2 and Sox2 (FIG. 10). Meanwhile, endogenous Foxa2, Brn2 and Sox2 genes expression was also up-regulated, suggesting that the endogenous gene network had been initiated. We characterized the iDPs through the expression levels of several key neural progenitor marker genes in skin fibroblasts (Fbb), WT-NPCs and iDPs by real-time RT-PCR analysis (for sequences of the primer pairs, see Table 2). The iDPs expressed high levels of neural progenitor markers, including Sox1, PAX6, ZBTB16, Sox3, CD133 and Nestin (FIG. 1C). Importantly, the iDPs also expressed high levels of Aldh1A1, Corin (Lrp4), Lmx1a, Msx1, Ngn2, Otx2, Mash1, Pitx3 and Nkx6.1 (FIG. 1D). These genes were previously reported to specifically express in dopaminergic neuron proliferative progenitor cells20,23,27,28. In contrast, unlike the primary forebrain neural progenitors (NPs), the iDPs expressed the minimum levels of FoxG1, GSX2, and Nkx2.1 (FIG. 1E), indicative of a forebrain identity10,29. These results suggest that fibroblasts could acquire the mesencephalic regional identity and dopaminergic neural fate through the forced expression of transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2.",
                                "iDPs Expressed Specific Dopaminergic Progenitor Markers and Possess Dopaminergic Neuronal-Restricted Differentiation Potential",
                                "Ploysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), doublecortin (DCX) and Corin (Lrp4) have been used to identify and isolate neuronal-restricted precursors from ESC-derived neural derivatives28,30,31. We characterized the iDPs that we developed through the immunostaining of cells with specific antibodies against PSA-NCAM, DCX and Corin, and observed that the iDPs specifically expressed all three of the marker genes in addition to the NPC marker gene Nestin (FIG. 2A). This suggests that the iDPs are dopaminergic neuron-restricted precursors. We further validated whether the iDPs are dopaminergic neuronal lineage-restricted by differentiating the iDPs into neurons in the presence of SHH and FGF8 stimulation followed by the treatment of BDNF, GDNF and ascorbic acid (AA) for neuronal maturation. Separately, astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation were induced by 10% serum and PDGF/forskolin, respectively. All \u03b2III-tubulin positive neurons derived from iDPs were TH positive (FIG. 2B), suggesting dopaminergic neuronal lineage-restricted fate for the iDPs. In contrast, no GFAP and O4 positive cells were observed after astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation, indicating that the iDPs had committed to the neuronal lineage (FIG. 2C). As a positive control, when WT-NPCs were put in the same astrocyte and oliogodendrocyte differentiation conditions, astrocyte and oliogodendrocyte developed (FIG. 2C). Unlike WT-NPCs, the iDPs also expressed much lower levels of glial-lineage related genes, such as Glast, olig1/2, NG2, GFAP and S100\u03b2 (FIG. 2D). Since these genes are critical regulators for glial-lineage development, the low expression profile of these genes further validated that the iDPs had given up their glia differentiation potentials and committed to a neuronal fate.",
                                "Next, the differentiation efficiency of iDPs into dopaminergic neurons was tested. A previously described neuronal differentiation protocol14 was adopted in the test and it was found that more than 90% of the Tuj+ neurons were TH+ dopaminergic neurons (FIG. 3A). Surprisingly, the efficiency for the iDPs to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons remained high in the absence of the pre-patterning morphogens SHH and FGF8 (FIG. 3B), strongly suggesting the dopaminergic neural fate of iDPs. The iDP-derived neurons also expressed synaptophysin involved in neurotransmitter exocytosis and neuroendocrine32. The synaptophysin staining appeared positive in cells of typical neuronal morphology. In contrast, an adjacent cell of different morphology appeared negative for synaptophysin, suggesting a specific staining for synaptophysin (FIG. 3C1-3). Furthermore, the synaptophysin had punctate distribution (FIG. 3C4), indicative of the synaptic formation in vitro. Notably, the iDP-derived DA neurons also exhibited immunoreactivities for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the brain-specific isoform of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) (FIG. 4A), which are three major functionally relevant proteins in dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, the DA neurons derived from iDPs exhibited functional membrane properties of mature neuron. In voltage clamp mode, voltage-gated K+ currents and Na+ currents can be evoked from a holding potential of \u221280 mV to test potentials range from \u221270 mV to +70 mV in 10-mV steps (FIGS. 4B, 4C and 4D). In current clamp mode, action potentials can be evoked in all iDPs tested by injection currents from 20 pA to 100 pA in 20-pA steps (FIGS. 4E and 4F, n=5). Those results strongly suggest that iDPs can effectively differentiate and generate mature and functional DA neurons.",
                                "Conditional Expression of L-Myc Induced Self-Renewal of iDPs",
                                "During the generation of iDPs, we observed that iDPs exhibited limited ability of self-renewal and clonogenicity, restricting cell expansion required for cell transplantation. We overcame this disadvantage by utilizing a Tet-On/Off system to transduce L-Myc, which is a transformation-deficient, safe and efficient approach that enhances self-renewal33,34 in iDPs. The conditional expression of L-Myc was under the control of doxycycline (Dox) (FIGS. 5A and 5B). The proportion of Ki67 positive cells significantly increased after DOX treatment for 72 hours (FIG. 5C), whereas the expression levels of DP marker genes Corin and DCX were not affected by the DOX treatment. These results confirmed that using L-Myc to induce self-renewal in iDPs is a safe, effective and efficient strategy for cell expansion intended for cell transplantation.",
                                "Grafted iDPs Survived, Differentiated into Dopaminergic Lineage and Functionally Alleviated Motor Deficits in a MPTP Mouse Model of PD",
                                "We tested whether the iDPs with conditional L-Myc expression will be safe, and can survive, terminally differentiate into specific dopaminergic neurons in vivo. First, we labeled iDPs with lentiviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and further enriched GFP+ cells by the puromycin resistance in vector (FIG. 11A). GFP+ iDPs were then injected into the striatum of a SCID mouse brain as illustrated in FIG. 11B. At 6 weeks following transplantation, we observed that the grafted GFP+ iDP-derived cells were distributed predominantly around the injection site (FIG. 11C), and the iDP-grafted mice showed no tumor formation at the injection site (FIG. 11D). These results suggest that engineered iDPs are safe for cell transplantation. To evaluate the functionalities of iDPs in vivo, we used a MPTP mouse model of PD as we previously described35, and performed cell transplantation in PD mouse model as experimental timeline illustrated in FIG. 6A. The mice were trained with rotarod and two trials were performed before MPTP intoxication to establish baseline performance. At one week after MPTP intoxication, iDPs were engrafted on both side of striatum through intracranial (IC) injection. The mice were monitored for 3 weeks for motor functions and then sacrificed for immunohistochemistry. The densities of TH+ DA neuron axonal termini in the striatum were determined by digital image analysis as previously described36. The MPTP treatment significantly decreased the densities of TH+ striatal termini, suggesting substantial loss of DA neuronal termini in striatum (FIG. 6B). Densitometric analysis of TH+ striatal termini by week 3 showed 50% loss of TH+ striatal termini. However, engraftment of MPTP mice with iDPs increased striatal termini densities by 20% (40% total loss, FIG. 6B). Interestingly, a majority of the iDP-derived cells were Tuj and TH double positive, but not GFAP positive cells (FIG. 6C), suggesting that the grafted cells survived in vivo for three weeks, and were preferentially differentiated into DA neurons but not astrocytes. Next, we evaluated the effect of iDPs engraftment on motor function of the MPTP mice. All mice group had similar baseline locomotor performance during pre-MPTP testing (FIG. 7A). Rotarod testing of MPTP mice by week 2 showed 55% reduction of locomotor functions. Engraftment of MPTP mice with iDPs increased rotarod performance (FIGS. 7B, 7C). By week 3 (4 weeks after MPTP intoxication), the MPTP mice showed 24% motor deficits compared with PBS group. The iDPs engraftment group had beneficial locomotor effects but not significant recovery of motor deficits (P=0.059, FIG. 7C). Together, these data suggest that iDPs engraftment after the development of MPTP lesion increase motor function in mice."

                    "paragraphs": [
                        "Stem cell-based therapy holds a promising future for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly in the case of PD. To achieve cell-based therapy for PD, significant efforts have been made to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to midbrain DA neurons following morphogenic stimulation37-40. Recently, direct conversion of cells of one lineage into another has served as an alternative strategy for engraftable cell sources. As a result, induced DA neurons7,41 and induced neural stem/progenitor cells (iNPCs)10-13 were generated and showed promise for DA neuron generation. However, the differentiation efficiency, safety, and the specificity of these cells remain a challenge. In the present study, we reported a novel cocktail of three transcription factors (Brn2/Brn4, Sox2 and Foxa2/Lmx1a) that successfully converted mouse skin fibroblasts into neural progenitors. The resulting iDPs were dopaminergic neuronal-restricted and independent of the pre-patterning by SHH/FGF8 (FIGS. 1-3). Most importantly, DA neurons derived from iDPs expressed the mature DA neuron markers in vitro, exhibited electrophysiological properties of mature DA neurons (FIG. 4), and survived in vivo for 6 weeks without tumor formation (FIG. 11), suggesting the iDPs can serve as a safe and efficient cell source for PD treatment.",
                        "Previous studies have employed Brn2/Brn4 and Sox2 as neural fate determinants for direct reprogramming of neural progenitor cells from fibroblasts10,13,17,19, but additional factors may be required to achieve the regional specification and neuronal-lineage restriction10,19. Foxa2 and Lmx1a appear to be critical factors that support the regulatory networks required for midbrain DA specification and the transcriptional control of midbrain dopaminergic development. To selectively generate the dopaminergic precursors, we decided to express Foxa2 and Lmx1a in 5F-iNPCs previously developed by our laboratory. The expression of Foxa2 and Lmx1a endowed 5F-iNPCs with midbrain identity and dramatically increased the yield of TH+ neurons (FIG. 8, FIG. 9), suggesting that these two factors could be used to improve the iNPCs-based cell therapy in PD.",
                        "Foxa2 and Lmx1a/b are known to cooperatively regulate the proliferation, specification, and differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic progenitors. More specifically, Foxa2 and Lmx1a/b are key transcription factors downstream of strong morphogens (SHH and Wnt1, respectively) that synergistically control the midbrain dopaminergic differentiation by forming two regulatory loops23,42. Previous studies on Foxa1/2 predominantly concentrated on the specification of midbrain progenitor identity and their regulatory roles on Lmx1a/b and Helt26,43-45. Foxa2 expression is restricted to the mesencephalic floor plate where it plays both SHH-dependent and -independent roles in the specification of floor plate from which DA neurons originate25,46. However, it is unclear whether Foxa2 may be a more potent determinant of midbrain DA progenitors than Lmx1a and SHH, or whether Foxa2 could serve as a reprogramming factor favoring the generation of DA neurons. In contrast, given the synergistic control by Foxa2 and Lmx1a/b of the midbrain dopaminergic differentiation, it is unlikely that either is sufficient by itself.",
                        "In this study, we have tested novel sets of transcription factors that included Brn2 and Sox2 with one or both of Foxa2 and Lmx1a in the reprogramming of fibroblasts as illustrated in the procedure (FIG. 1A). We observed that all combinations resulted in the clonogenicity at 14 day post-infection (data not shown). Thus, either the combination of Brn2, Sox2 and Foxa2, or the combination of Brn2, Sox2 and Lmx1a can be used to transdifferentiate fibroblasts. Furthermore, the combination of Brn2, Sox2 and Foxa2 successfully converted fibroblasts into stable and expansible iDPs. The iDPs expressed the specific neural progenitor markers, and also exhibited the midbrain identity characterized by the marker genes for dopaminergic neural progenitor cells, such as Aldh1A1, Corin (Lrp4), Lmx1a, Msx1, Ngn2, Otx2, Mash1, Pitx3 and Nkx6.1 (FIG. 1). Among these markers, Aldh1A1 and Corin have been used to specifically mark DPs in the brain and isolate DPs from ES cell-derivatives28,47. In addition, DCX and PSA-NCAM have been used to isolate the neuronal lineage-restricted progenitors24,30,31. Otx2 prevents the serotonin fate of the progenitors by repressing Nkx2.248, and Foxa2 negatively regulates Helt to inhibit the GABAergic neuron differentiation in the ventral midbrain43-45. Because the reprogramming factors Brn2 and Sox2 could not generate DA-specified iNPCs, our results suggest that Foxa2 can work cooperatively with Brn2 and Sox2 to drive the direct conversion of fibroblasts into iNPCs with midbrain progenitor identity.",
                        "It should be noted that given Brn2 and Brn4 have previously been used interchangeably in several transdifferentiation studies, here a Brn4, Sox2 and Foxa2 combination (or Brn4, Sox2 and Lmx1a; or Brn2, Brn4, Sox2 and Foxa2; or Brn2, Brn4, Sox2 and Lmx1a; or Brn2, Brn4, Sox2, Foxa2 and Lmx1a) can also be used to transdifferentiate fibroblasts.",
                        "Our present study demonstrates that ectopic expression of Foxa2 positively regulates Lmx1a, Otx2 and other key transcription factors responsible for DA neuron development, and negatively regulates transcription factors related to glial cell development (FIG. 2). Thus, the resulting iDPs are committed to the dopaminergic lineage with minimum glial cells differentiation potential (FIG. 2). Terminal differentiation in the presence of BDNF, GDNF and AA could steer the iDPs into mature and functional DA neurons independent of SHH/FGF8 stimulation (FIG. 3 and FIG. 4). This role of Foxa2 is consistent with a previous report that shows Foxa2 can execute the midbrain floor plate program via SHH-independent and -dependent mechanisms46.",
                        "In vivo grafted NSCs/NPCs often terminally differentiate into astrocytes rather than functional neurons in response to injury15,16. Our strategy in engineering iDPs with controllable L-Myc expression (FIG. 5) is a confirmation of the way to efficiently, safely and practically control the self-renewal of iDPs33,34. When the iDPs were transplanted into the striatum of MPTP PD mouse model following the timeline illustrated in FIG. 6A, we observed that MPTP injection damaged TH+ neurons in the striatum, whereas grafted iDPs significantly recovered the striatal TH density after cell transplantation, and very few of them terminally differentiated into astrocytes. Indeed, the majority of cells differentiated into DA neurons at 6 weeks post-transplantation, and no tumor or cell outgrowths were observed, and the partially recovery of motor function in PD mouse model after cell transplantation further suggest that the iDPs may serve as a useful cell source for PD treatment.",
                        "Collectively, we demonstrated that Brn2/Brn4, Sox2 and Foxa2/Lmx1a could successfully convert mouse skin fibroblasts into induced neural progenitors, and Foxa2/Lmx1a confers the induced neural progenitors with the specification of midbrain identity and DA lineage. The success of this work could also provide an important foundation for a cellular model to investigate the pathogenesis of PD when patient skin fibroblasts are reprogrammed into iDPs with Brn2/Brn4, Sox2 and Foxa2/Lmx1a in vitro. Finally, the managed expansion of the engineered iDPs further provides a promising therapeutic cell source for PD."

All animal procedures were conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups before motor function and behavior training (FIG. 6A). MPTP intoxication was performed as previously described35. Briefly, mice received four subcutaneous injections, one every 2 hours of either vehicle (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 10 ml/kg) or MPTP-HCL (20 mg/kg, free base in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, Mo., USA). MPTP handling and safety measures were in accordance with the published guidelines50. For iDPs engraftment, at 7 days after MPTP intoxication, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (16 mg/kg) by i.p, placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Ill., www.stoeltingco.com) for IC injection (FIG. 6A). A linear skin incision was made over the bregma, and two 1-mm burr holes were drilled in the skull 0.2 mm posterior and 3.5 mm lateral to the bregma using a hand-held driller. iDPs (0.25 million per injection) were labeled with GFP expressing retrovirus and injected into the striatum of both hemispheres. Saline was used as a control for iDPs injection. Coordinates for inoculation were set as: 0.22 mm posterior to bregma, 3.25 mm lateral from the Sagittal midline, and a depth of 2.9 mm in vertical line. A Hamilton 10-\u03bc1 syringe (Fisher) was used for cell injection. Mice were sacrificed 21 days post-injection after intracardiac perfusion and brains were quickly removed.

The method of claim 20, wherein the change is one or more of: cell growth, cell survival, or gene expression change in one or more of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Sox1, PAX6, ZBTB16, Sox3, CD133, Nestin, Aldh1A1, Corin (Lrp4), Lmx1a, Msx1, Ngn2, Otx2, Mash1, Pitx3 and Nkx6.1, ploysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), and/or doublecortin (DCX).",
        "22. The method of claim 20, wherein the iDPs are transdifferentiated from a patient's somatic cells, wherein the patient has Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia or schizophrenia, and wherein the method identifies agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia or schizophrenia.",
        "23. A composition comprising one or more vectors carrying isolated genes comprising\n(1) one or both of Brn2 and Brn4, or a variant thereof,\n(2) Sox2 or a variant thereof, and\n(3) one or both of Foxa2 and Lmx1, or a variant thereof.",
        "24. The composition of claim 23, wherein the one or more vectors carry Brn2 or a variant thereof, Sox2 or a variant thereof, and Foxa2 or a variant thereof.",
        "25. The composition of claim 23, wherein the vector is a viral vector."
