When nutrient and growth factor levels are high, the TOR kinase is active, and drives growth by promoting anabolic processes such as protein synthesis and by inhibiting catabolic processes, such as autophagy. In contrast, when nutrient or growth factor levels are low, or cells are exposed to stress, TOR signaling is inhibited. As a result, mass accumulation is limited and catabolic and stress response pathways are up-regulated. If strong TOR inhibition persists, cells enter a quiescent state.",

Once activated, TORC1 affects cell growth through numerous downstream regulators. In S. cerevisiae, where TOR output is best understood, TORC1 acts on, and through, two well characterized effectors: (1) Sch9, an S6 kinase that coordinates protein synthesis through regulation of RNA polymerases I and III, ribosome synthesis and biogenesis, and protein translation and (2) TAP42, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), that controls metabolic and stress responses (FIG. 1b). TORC1 also acts through Sfp1, a transcription factor that regulates ribosome synthesis, and the kinase Yak1 (FIG. 1b). The overall structure, and the molecular makeup of TORC1 and the TOR pathway are similar in humans and other eukaryotes."

                                "Progress has been made towards identifying the pathways and mechanisms underlying TORC1 regulation. It has been shown that the TSC1 and 2 tumor suppressor proteins (which are absent in yeast) act to transmit signals from insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), AMP dependent kinase (AMPK), and other pathways, to TORC1. More recently, it was found that AMPK also regulates TORC1 activity independently of TSC1/2, by phosphorylating Kog1/Raptor (FIG. 1a) directly at two sites, one of which is conserved across eukaryotes. This activity ensures that cell growth is limited as cellular energy levels wane. Finally, a family of Ras related GTP binding proteins (Rag proteins) have been found to regulate TOR activity in response to amino acid availability, through direct binding to TORC1, in both yeast and human cells.",
                                "Stress also influences TOR pathway activity, although it is unclear whether this is due to direct regulation of TORC1 or regulation of one or a few downstream components of the TOR pathway. The pathways involved in stress dependent TOR regulation are also unknown. In human cells, it has been shown that osmotic stress leads to a rapid decrease in phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and 4EBP-1, resulting in reduced protein translation. These affects are independent of TSC1/2 and thus the underlying mechanism may be conserved in yeast. Down regulation of S6K1 activity has also been found in human cells in mechanical, ultraviolet radiation, and heat stress. In S. cerevisiae, similar effects have been seen. Most strikingly, osmotic, heat, and oxidative stress trigger a rapid decrease in Sch9 (the yeast S6K1) phosphorylation at the TORC1 target sites. These same stresses also cause the TORC1 regulated transcription factor Sfp1 to be exported from the nucleus."

                                "Previous studies of TOR pathway signaling in stress have been limited to measuring phosphorylation of a single substrate, Sch9. As a result it was not clear whether stress signals inhibit TORC1 activity directly or simply act on one or two TORC1 targets proteins. To help distinguish between these possibilities, the complete output of TORC1 pathway in osmotic stress was measured using DNA microarrays. To do this, the cellular response was monitored with and without the potent TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin in 0.4M KCl and three control conditions: amino acid starvation, nitrogen starvation and log growth conditions. As shown in FIG. 2, rapamycin treatment of rapidly growing cells, where TORC1 is active, led to widespread and dramatic reprogramming of gene expression (FIG. 2a). However, in KCl stress and starvation conditions, rapamycin had almost no influence on gene expression (FIG. 2a). These results suggest that TORC1 is inhibited in stress (as shown previously in starvation conditions) so that rapamycin has no additional effect.",
                                "Consistent with the hypothesis that TORC1 activity is inhibited in stress, genes involved in ribosome synthesis, biogenesis and tRNA synthesis are down-regulated in KCl to a level at or near that found in rapamycin (FIG. 2a, columns 1 and 5). This is not just due to down-regulation of Sch9 activity (which does occur, FIG. 2b) as blocking the activity or regulation of this kinase has a relatively small effect on ribosome protein and biogenesis gene expression (2-fold versus >20-fold in KCl stress). Thus, it could be concluded that TORC1 stops phosphorylating and activating all (or most) of the regulators in the Sch9 branch (blue/purple, FIG. 1b) of the TOR pathway (Sch9, Sfp1, Yak1 and likely others) in stress.",
                                "It was also found that the output of TORC1 pathway is different in salt stress than in rapamycin. Specifically, while both stimuli cause down-regulation of ribosome genes, only rapamycin triggers activation of the carbonic acid, amino acid and nitrogen metabolic pathways (FIG. 2a). These metabolic pathways are targets of TORC1 via TAP42/PP2A and the transcription factors Gat1, Gln3, Rtg1/3 (FIG. 1b). This data shows that salt stress inhibits growth by blocking activation of the Sch9 branch of the TOR pathway, but does not trigger TORC1 dependent reprogramming of metabolism through PP2A. This metabolic reprogramming is also known to occur due to TORC1 inhibition in starvation conditions. Therefore, these results suggest that the output of the TOR pathway is stimuli specific. This has important implications for future studies examining the role TOR pathway in cell growth and metabolism and in drug development.",
                                "An interpretation of the microarray data is that stress alters the conformation of TORC1 such that phosporylation of the Sch9 branch of the pathway, but not Tap42-PP2A, is blocked and the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin-Fpr1 (rapamycin-Fkb12 in mammals) can no longer bind/repress TORC1. Alternatively, TORC1 activity may be completely inhibited in stress, so that addition of rapamycin has no further effect, but an additional modification to the Tap42/PP2A complex keeps it from being activated by dephosphorylation at the TORC1 target sites. Models that do not include direct regulation of TORC1 in stress are also possible, but they may have to invoke a stress specific modification to the Tap42-PP2A branch of the pathway that has no affect on gene expression (as these genes are not regulated by stress) but blocks activation of the pathway by rapamycin.",
                                "In osmotic stress, Hog1/p38, the terminal kinase in the HOG pathway, is known to regulate many aspects of the stress response including transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle check-points, and ion and glycerol channel regulation. Therefore, it was tested whether Hog1/p38 plays a role transmitting stress signals to TORC1 by comparing expression in hog1\u0394 and wild-type cells both with and without rapamycin (e.g., with and without TORC1 activity) using DNA microarrays. These analyses revealed that Hog1 does in fact repress TORC1 in salt stress conditions. This repression is manifest as approximately 3-fold less ribosome gene repression in hog1\u0394 than wild-type cells in 0.4M KCl (FIG. 2c, column 5). The hog1\u0394 strain is also far more sensitive to rapamycin in salt stress that the wild-type strain (4 fold more repression in hog1\u0394 than wt, FIG. 2c), indicating that TORC1 is partially active in stress in the absence of Hog1.",
                                "TOR pathway activity was measured in the hog1\u0394 strain by following TORC1 dependent phosphorylation of Sch9 (FIG. 2d). Consistent with the microarray results, 40% more phosphorylation was found at the six TORC1 dependent C-terminal sites (after 10 min) in KCl stress when Hog1 is deleted (FIG. 2d).",
                                "Together, this data shows that the MAPK Hog1/p38, plays a role in repressing TORC1 signaling through Sch9, and possibly other regulators in the Sch9 branch of the pathway, in salt stress conditions."

Glucose and energy levels control TORC1 activity via AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK or Snf1). When adequate energy levels are present, Snf1/AMPK is inactive and TORC1 is localized to the vacuolar (lysosomal) membrane, where it interacts with activator proteins such as the Rags and Rho1. Under stress, e.g., when glucose/energy levels fall, Snf1/AMPK is activated, leading to TORC1 inhibition.",
                                "When this happens, the key regulatory component of TORC1, known as Kog1 in yeast (Raptor in humans), relocalizes and aggregates in each cell (see FIG. 3a). Examination of the Kog1 peptide sequence revealed two glutamine repeat sequences. Glutamine rich sequences are predicted to drive assembly of the protein into a prion-like aggregate (see FIG. 4). Mutating either glutamine repeat region reduces the formation of the aggregates (Kog1 bodies) (see FIG. 3b). Mutants that cannot form Kog1 bodies activate the TORC1 complex following starvation more quickly than wild type cells (see FIG. 5). In other words, sequestration of Kog1 bodies helps cells remain in a state with TORC1/Sch9 inhibited until the cell experiences ideal conditions for an extend time. Without the Kog1 bodies, TORC1 is immediately activated even after long periods of starvation; this makes the cell more susceptible to stress (including drug treatment) and subsequent starvation.",

However, the mammalian and plant forms of Kog1 (i.e., Raptor) do not contain glutamine repeats or prion-like domains. Therefore compositions, agents, or drugs that either block or trigger/permit Kog1 aggregation may help fight infections in humans, animals, and plants.",
