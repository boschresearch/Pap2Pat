    "abstract": "The target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the small GTPases, Gtr1/2. However, little is known about the way that other nutrient signals are transmitted to TORC1. Here we report that glucose starvation triggers disassembly of TORC1, and movement of the key TORC1 component Kog1/Raptor to a single body near the edge of the vacuole. These events are driven by Snf1/AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 at Ser 491/494 and two nearby prion-like motifs. Kog1-bodies then serve to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation in cells that have been starved for a significant period of time. Together, our data show that Kog1-bodies create hysteresis (memory) in the TORC1 pathway and help ensure that cells remain committed to a quiescent state under suboptimal conditions. We suggest that other protein bodies formed in starvation conditions have a similar function.",

                "The Target Of Rapamycin Complex I (TORC1) is made up of three essential proteins, called mTOR, Raptor and mLST8 in humans and Tor1, Kog1 and Lst8 in yeast (Kim et al., 2002; Loewith et al., 2002). Biochemical and structural studies show that these proteins form a stable ring structure, containing two copies of each subunit (Adami et al., 2007; Yip et al., 2010). Kog1/Raptor is known to recruit substrates to the TOR kinase (Tor1) and is required for regulation of Tor1 activity (Hara et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002). Lst8, on the other hand, binds directly to the kinase domain in Tor1 (Yip et al., 2010) and may help stabilize the interaction between Kog1 and Tor1 (Kim et al., 2002). In yeast, TORC1 also includes the non-essential (and poorly characterized) protein Tco89 (Reinke et al., 2004).",
                "In the presence of pro-growth hormones and the appropriate nutrients, TORC1 is active and drives protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating a wide range of proteins (Bodenmiller et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2011; Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Loewith and Hall, 2011; Robitaille et al., 2013). In contrast, when hormone, nutrient or energy levels drop below a critical level, TORC1 is inhibited, causing the cell to switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism and eventually enter a quiescent state (Barbet et al., 1996; Duvel et al., 2010; Loewith and Hall, 2011).",
                "In higher eukaryotes, hormone signals are transmitted to TORC1 through the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to AKT, which in turn phosphorylates the tuberous sclerosis complex (Inoki et al., 2002; Manning et al., 2002). The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1, TSC2 and TBC1D7) then dissociates from the lysosomal surface, triggering activation of the small GTPase, Rheb, and subsequently TORC1 (Dibble and Manning, 2013; Menon et al., 2014). However, these pro-growth signals are blocked in energy starvation conditions due to stimulation of the AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and hyperactivates TSC1-TSC2 to inhibit Rheb and TORC1 (Inoki et al., 2003a; Inoki et al., 2003b).",
                "AMPK also inhibits TORC1 by phosphorylating Kog1/Raptor at two sites (Gwinn et al., 2008). One of these sites is highly conserved in eukaryotes (Ser 959 in S. cerevisiae) but does not appear to influence TORC1 activity in budding yeast (Kawai et al., 2011).",
                "In both higher and lower eukaryotes, amino acid/nitrogen signals are transmitted to TORC1 through another class of small GTPases, known as Gtr1/2 in yeast and the Rags in humans (Binda et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). Gtr1/2 are tethered to the vacuolar/lysosomal membrane via the EGO complex (Ragulator in humans) and the vacuolar ATPase, where they respond to amino acid signals by binding and activating TORC1 (Bar-Peled et al., 2012; Binda et al., 2009; Panchaud et al., 2013; Sancak et al., 2010; Zoncu et al., 2011).",
                "Outside of nitrogen/amino acid starvation conditions, little is known about the way nutrient and stress signals trigger changes in TORC1 activity, particularly in organisms such as S. cerevisiae that are missing TSC1/2 and where there is no clear link between AMPK and TORC1 activity. For example, studies in yeast have shown that glucose starvation completely blocks TORC1 signaling, but only around 20% of this inhibition depends on Gtr1/2 and the other known TORC1 regulator in yeast, Rho1 (Hughes Hallett et al., 2014).",
                "Here, to learn more about TORC1 regulation, we examine the localization of Tor1 and Kog1 in budding yeast, in glucose starvation and other conditions. Surprisingly, we find that glucose starvation leads to disassembly of the TOR complex and movement of Kog1 from the vacuolar membrane to a single body on the edge of the vacuole, while glucose repletion leads to a reversal of this process. Following up on these observations we show that the AMPK, Snf1, drives Kog1 into bodies by phosphorylating, or triggering the phosphorylation of, Kog1 at Ser 491 and 494. Furthermore, we find that these phosphorylation sites are located in one of two, glutamine-rich prion-like motifs in Kog1, and that these motifs are required for the formation of Kog1-bodies. Finally, by measuring phosphorylation of the key TORC1 substrate, Sch9, in a variety of mutants, we show that Kog1 agglomeration increases the threshold for TORC1 activation.",
                "Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism of TORC1 regulation and show that protein body formation can block the activation of a pathway by weak stimuli. The numerous other protein bodies formed in yeast, and other organisms, may have a similar function\u2014creating hysteresis (memory) in key signaling and metabolic pathways to ensure that once cells commit to a stress or starvation state, they only exit when conditions are optimal."

Surprisingly, we found that Kog1 and Tco89 move from their known location on the vacuolar membrane (marked with Vph1-mCherry), to a single body near the edge of the vacuole, within 60 min in most cells (Figure 1A and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).

                        "To study Kog1-body formation in more detail, we next followed Kog1-YFP localization in cells transferred from rich medium (SD) to glucose starvation, nitrogen starvation, glucose + nitrogen starvation, and osmotic stress conditions. In glucose starvation and nitrogen + glucose starvation we saw rapid formation of Kog1-bodies ( \u03c4 = 11.0 \u00b1 2.8 and 13.6 \u00b1 2.4 min) in 57 \u00b1 5% and 73 \u00b1 4% of cells, respectively (Figure 1C). Kog1-bodies also formed in nitrogen starvation conditions, albeit at a much slower rate (\u03c4\u00a0= 153 \u00b1 25 min; Figure 1C). However, we did not see a significant increase in Kog1-body formation in osmotic stress or when cells were simply transferred into fresh SD medium (Figure 1C).",
                        "In separate experiments, we also followed Kog1-body formation during long periods of glucose and/or nitrogen starvation (2-\u20136 hrs). In all cases, we saw slow accumulation of Kog1-bodies, beyond the levels found at one hour, until 80-85% of cells had a least one, but on occasion 2 or 3, Kog1 bodies (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2, 3). Cultures grown to saturation in SD medium also formed Kog1-bodies in ~\u223c85% of cells (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4).",
                        "Finally, to determine if Kog1-body formation is a reversible process, we exposed cells to glucose starvation conditions for 60 min and then followed Kog1-YFP localization after adding 0.02%, 0.1%, or 2% glucose back to the medium. In both 0.1% and 2% glucose, we saw Kog1 move out of the bodies and back onto the vacuolar membrane over an approximately one-hour time-period (\u03c4 = 48 \u00b1 8 and 45 \u00b1 10 min, respectively; Figure 1D). This relocalization also occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, demonstrating that existing Kog1-bodies dissociate during glucose repletion (Figure 1D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5).",
                        "Putting these data together we conclude that Kog1-body formation is a rapid ( \u03c4\u00a0= \u223c10 min) and reversible process, triggered by glucose and nitrogen starvation."

                        "Previous work has shown that TORC1 can localize to stress granules in both yeast and human cells (Takahara and Maeda, 2012; Thedieck et al., 2013; Wippich et al., 2013). To determine if Kog1 associates with stress granules (or related structures known as P-bodies [Parker, 2012]) in glucose starvation conditions, we transfected cells carrying Kog1-YFP with mCherry-tagged versions of the stress granule marker Pbp1 or the P-body marker Edc3, and followed YFP and RFP localization. We found that stress granules start to form after 60 min in glucose starvation conditions, and become pervasive in cells grown to saturation in SD medium, but only co-localize with Kog1-bodies in 2.6% of cells (0% co-localization after 60 min, n = 94; 2.6% co-localization after 24 hrs, n = 190; Figure 2A). Similarly, P-bodies form in >80% cells after 60 min of glucose starvation, but only co-localize with Kog1-bodies in 3.4% of cells (n = 404; Figure 2B). Therefore, it appears that the Kog1-bodies formed in starvation conditions are distinct from both stress granules and P-bodies.10.7554/eLife.09181.009Figure 2.Kog1-YFP does not associate with stress granules or P-bodies in glucose starvation conditions.(A) Localization of Kog1-YFP after 60 min or 24 hrs of glucose starvation in cells expressing the stress granule marker Pbp1-mCherry.

                        "Once we determined that Kog1-body formation occurs independently of stress granule and P-body formation, we sought to identify the signal that triggers Kog1 agglomeration in glucose starvation conditions. In a previous study we showed that the AMP activated protein kinase, Snf1, is required for TORC1 pathway inhibition during glucose starvation (Hughes Hallett et al., 2014). We therefore wondered if Snf1 regulates TORC1, at least in part, by driving Kog1 agglomeration. To test this hypothesis we monitored Kog1-YFP localization in snf1\u0394\u00a0cells. These experiments revealed that deletion of Snf1 causes a dramatic, 20-fold, increase in the time-constant for Kog1-body formation ( \u03c4\u00a0= 219 \u00b1 21 min in snf1\u0394 cells; Figure 3A).10.7554/eLife.09181.010Figure 3.Snf1 Dependent Phosphorylation of Kog1 drives Kog1-body formation.(A-\u2013\u2013B) Time-course data showing the fraction of (A) snf1\u0394 and (B) Kog1S491A/S494A cells that contain Kog1-bodies in SD medium (2% Glu) and at various time-points after glucose withdrawal (0% Glu).

The plasmids were then cut using PflF1, and transformed into a wild type train (ACY044). In all cases this led to insertion of the plasmid at the Kog1 locus, creating a wild-type copy of Kog1, followed by the URA3 gene, followed by a mutant copy of Kog1 (AA, DD, or EE; as confirmed by sequencing). We then isolated colonies that excised the plasmid by selection on 5FOA. In this final step, we expected to find colonies that retain the wild-type copy of Kog1 as well as colonies that retain the mutated copy of Kog1 (depending on the site of recombination during the loop out event). In line with our expectations, we found 7/10 of the colonies created by looping in, and looping out, Kog1S491A/S494A had the AA mutation (the other 3 were wild-type). In contrast, we found 0/20 colonies had the DD mutation and 0/12 strains had the EE mutation. Specifically, we can calculate the probability of finding 0/20 DD and 0/12 EE mutations by chance, given that we found 7/10 AA mutations, at p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively, using Fisher\u2019s exact test. The probability of finding 0/32 DD and EE mutants by chance, given that we found 7/10 AA mutants, is less than 1\u00a0x\u00a010-\u20135. This strongly suggests that strains carrying Kog1 with phosphomimetic substitutions at Ser 491 and 494 are inviable.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09181.013",
                        "Next, to determine how Snf1 activates Kog1-body formation, we purified TORC1 from cells: (1) growing in SD medium, (2) exposed to glucose starvation conditions for 5 min, and (3) exposed to osmotic stress conditions for 5 min (see Material\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We then used mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation sites on Tor1 and Kog1 in each condition. These data showed that Kog1 is phosphorylated on Ser 491 and 494 in glucose starvation conditions, but not in osmotic stress or SD medium (Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2). A short time later, Young and coworkers showed that Ser 491 and 494 on Kog1 are Snf1-dependent phosphorylation sites (Braun et al., 2014). Therefore, to test if Snf1 drives Kog1-body formation by promoting phosphorylation of Ser 491 and 494, we constructed a strain carrying Kog1S491A/S494A-YFP at the native locus and monitored Kog1 localization in glucose starvation conditions. We found that Kog1S491A/S494A forms bodies slowly ( \u03c4\u03c4\u00a0= 309 \u00b1 48 min; Figure 3B), and at a rate similar to that found in the snf1\u0394 strain (\u03c4 = 219 \u00b1 21 min; Figure 3A). Thus, Snf1 increases the rate of Kog1 body formation by phosphorylating, or triggering phosphorylation, of Kog1 in glucose starvation conditions.",
                        "Kog1S491A/S494A cells also showed a reduced level of Kog1-body formation in SD medium (2.3 \u00b1 0.1% bodies in Kog1S491A/S494A cells versus 8.6 \u00b1 2.8% in wild type cells; Figure 3B). This was not seen in the snf1\u0394 strain (8.3 \u00b1 0.8% bodies in SD; Figure 3A), suggesting that either an additional kinase phosphorylates Kog1 at positions 491 and 494 in log growth conditions or that mutation of Ser 491 and 494 to alanine also inhibits Kog1 agglomeration by altering the physical properties of Kog1.",
                        "Finally, to test the impact that constitutive phosphorylation of Kog1 has on Kog1-body formation; we attempted to create strains carrying the phosphomimetic variants Kog1S491D/S494D and Kog1S491E/S494E. However, these mutants were not viable, indicating that Kog1-body formation (or Kog1 phosphorylation) inhibits cell growth and/or division (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3)."

These motifs tend to have long stretches of glutamine and/or asparagine residues and a low number of hydrophobic and/or charged residues (Alberti et al., 2009). In examining the Kog1 sequence we identified two such motifs, both containing long stretches of glutamine (Figure 4A). These regions were also identified as PriLMs using a hidden Markov Model trained on known prion sequences (Alberti et al., 2009). Interestingly, the first of these PriLMs includes the Snf1 dependent phosphorylation sites at Ser 491 and 494, while the second, smaller, PriLM is located approximately 300 amino acids away (Figure 4A).10.7554/eLife.09181.014Figure 4.Kog1-body Formation Depends on Prion-Like Domains in Kog1.(A) Sequence of two prion-like motifs in Kog1 (red letters) as defined by Alberti and coworkers (Alberti et al., 2009).

                        "To determine if the PriLMs in Kog1 are involved in Kog1-body formation we mutated a stretch of glutamines in each motif, to form a stretch of alanines (Figure 4A), and measured the impact on Kog1-YFP localization. Disruption of prion-like motif 1 (PrDm1) caused a >2-fold decrease Kog1-body formation, both in SD medium (2.76 \u00b1 0.6% in PrDm1 versus 8.6 \u00b1 2.8% in wt; Figure 4B) and in glucose starvation conditions (26 \u00b1 2.7% in PrDm1 versus 57 \u00b1 5% in wt; Figure 4B). Disruption of prion-like motif 2 (PrDm2) also caused a (small) decrease Kog1-body formation in glucose starvation conditions (45 \u00b1 4% in PrDm2 versus 57 \u00b1 5% bodies in wt; Figure 4B). More remarkably, however, disruption of PriLM1 and PriLM2 completely blocked Kog1-body formation in both SD medium and glucose starvation conditions (1.0 \u00b1 2.1% cells with bodies; Figure 4B). Thus, Kog1-body formation depends on the two prion-like motifs in Kog1."

                        "During log growth, TORC1 phosphorylates and activates the S6 kinase, Sch9, to drive protein and ribosome synthesis (Bodenmiller et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2011; Urban et al., 2007). This key signaling event is readily measured using a band-shift assay developed by Loewith and coworkers (Urban et al., 2007). Using this assay, we asked if and how Kog1-bodies influence TORC1 signaling by following Sch9 phosphorylation in five strains that have a defect in Kog1-body formation (Kog1S491A/S494A, snf1\u0394,\u00a0PrDm1, PrDm2, PrDm1 + 2).",
                        "We found that Sch9 is phosphorylated at or near wild-type levels during log phase growth in all of our mutant strains (Figures 5A, B). Sch9 is then rapidly (\u22642.5 min) and completely dephosphorylated during glucose starvation in the wild-type, Kog1S491A/S494A, PrDm1, PrDm2 and PrDm1 + 2 strains (Figures 5A, B). Thus, Kog1-body formation does not appear to play a significant role in TORC1-Sch9 signaling during acute glucose starvation since (1) Sch9 dephosphorylation occurs much faster than the accumulation of Kog1-bodies ( \u03c4\u03c4\u00a0= <2.5 min versus 11 \u00b1 3 min) and (2) most of the mutants that have a defect in Kog1-body formation behave like the wild-type strain in the Sch9 phosphorylation assay. The only exception is the snf1\u0394\u00a0strain, where we see a clear defect in Sch9 dephosphorylation after 5 and 10 min of glucose starvation (Figure 5A). However, it is very unlikely that this defect is due to inhibition of Kog1-body formation, since the Kog1S491A/S494A strain does not have a defect in the Sch9 assay (Figure 5A). Instead, it appears that Snf1 regulates the TORC1 pathway by triggering Kog1 phosphorylation at Ser 491 and 494, and through an additional, unknown, mechanism.10.7554/eLife.09181.015Figure 5.Impact of Kog1-bodies on TORC1 Signaling.(A) Bandshift assays measuring Sch9 phosphorylation in SD medium (0 min; 2% glucose), at various time-points after glucose withdrawal (2.5-\u201360min; 0% glucose), and then at various time-points after adding 2% glucose back to the cultures (1, 5, 10, and 20 min; 2% glucose).

                        "After discovering that TORC1/Sch9 inhibition precedes Kog1-body formation, we reasoned that Kog1 agglomeration might act as a slow step to lock TORC1 in an inactive state. To test this hypothesis we subjected wild-type and mutant strains to acute glucose starvation for 60 min, added 2% glucose back to the medium, and then followed Sch9 phosphorylation (Figure 5A). To our surprise, we saw complete, or near complete, Sch9 phosphorylation in all of our strains (Figures 5A, B). However, when we repeated this experiment, but only added 0.02% or 0.1% glucose back to the medium, we saw significantly more Sch9 phosphorylation in the mutant cells than in wild-type cells (Figures 5C, D and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2). In fact, 0.1% glucose triggered \u223c50% Sch9 phosphorylation in the wild-type strain compared with \u223c100% Sch9 phosphorylation in our strongest mutant, PrDm1 + 2 (Figure 5D). These results are remarkable since only 60% of wild-type cells have Kog1-bodies in our starting conditions (Figure 1C) and as a result, it should only be possible to see a 60% increase in Sch9 phosphorylation in the mutant strains (an increase from 40% activity in wild-type cells to 100% activity in mutant cells). Therefore, putting all of our band-shift data together, we conclude that Kog1-body formation acts to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation in cells subjected to medium or long-term glucose starvation."

                "In this study we show that glucose starvation leads to rapid\u00a0inactivation of TORC1/Sch9 signaling (\u03c4<2.5 min, Figure 5), dissociation of the Kog1-Tor1 complex, and the formation of Kog1-bodies (\u03c4 = 11 \u00b1 3 min). Kog1-bodies then act to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation--probably by limiting the number of intact TORC1 molecules in the cell. In other words, Kog1-body formation helps ensure that cells commit to a starvation or quiescent state, once they have been in glucose starvation conditions for a significant period of time. This is likely important for survival in natural conditions where yeast cells are exposed to a complex and fluctuating environment, and may need to remain in a quiescent state for years (Loewith and Hall, 2011).",
                "We also show that Kog1-body formation is driven by the AMPK, Snf1. This kinase is inactive during log growth and then activated upon glucose starvation, where it triggers massive changes in transcription and metabolism (Braun et al., 2014; Hedbacker and Carlson, 2008; Usaite et al., 2009). As part of this program, Snf1 activates phosphorylation of Kog1 at Ser 491 and 494. It is important to note, however, that Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 is probably indirect since the sequence around Ser 491 and 494 (AVANLS*TMS*LVN) does not match known AMPK targets sites such as LRRVxS*xxNL and MKKSxS*xxDV (Gwinn et al., 2008). Further work is therefore needed to identify the kinase that acts downstream of Snf1 to phosphorylate Kog1.",
                "Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 occurs in the middle of a glutamine rich, prion-like motif. We show that this prion-like motif and another similar motif, located 300 amino acids away, are essential for Kog1-body formation. Interestingly, the Snf1-dependent phosphorylation sites, and both prion-like domains found in S. cerevisae, are conserved in numerous other yeast species including the pathogen Candida glabrata (Figure 6). However, we could not find prion-like domains in Kog1 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Neurospora Crassa, and related species (Figure 6). Strikingly, most (5/6) of the yeast species missing prion-like domains in Kog1 have genes encoding the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and TSC2), while all (17/17) of the yeast species with prion-like domains in Kog1 are missing the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 or TSC1 and TSC2 genes; Table 1).10.7554/eLife.09181.018Figure 6.Partial alignment of Kog1 sequences from S. cerevisiae and 22 fungal orthologs.(A) PriLM1 and (B) PriLM2 (shown in bold) were defined using a hidden Markov Model trained on known yeast prion domains (Alberti et al., 2009).

(2) Species carrying PriLM1 of intermediate Q/N richness lack Tsc1 but carry the Tsc2 gene. The influence on TSC pathway signaling is unclear.

                "We also find prion-like domains in Kog1 from C. elegans and other related species, but not in flies, mice or humans (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Again, the organisms with prion-like domains in Kog1 are missing TSC1 and TSC2 (Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1).",
                "The observation that most organisms either have prion-like domains in Kog1, or have genes encoding the tuberous sclerosis complex, is especially interesting when you consider the similarities between TSC1-TSC2 and Kog1-body function. Studies in human cells have shown that the TSC1-TSC2 complex serves to inhibit TORC1 in the absence of pro-growth hormones and/or the presence of AMPK activity (Huang and Manning, 2008; Inoki et al., 2002; Inoki et al., 2003b), while we show that Kog1-body formation serves to inhibit TORC1 in the absence of glucose and the presence of AMPK activity. It therefore appears that the mechanisms underlying TORC1 regulation diverged in early eukaryotic evolution, so that most simple eukaryotes use Kog1-body formation to regulate TORC1 signaling, while higher eukaryotes (like flies, mice and humans) use the TSC1-2 complex. Going forward, it will be important to learn more about the differences between these two regulatory mechanisms, especially as drugs targeting Kog1-bodies may be able to block the growth of fungi and worms without affecting TORC1 signaling in humans and other higher eukaryotes.",
                "Beyond establishing a role for Kog1-body formation in TORC1 regulation, the data presented here shed light on the role that protein body formation plays in a cell. Studies in yeast, and other organisms, have shown that hundreds of proteins move into bodies, when cells are exposed to stress or starvation conditions (Narayanaswamy et al., 2009; O'Connell et al., 2014; O'Connell et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2014). For example, more than 30 proteins involved in mRNA decay and translation move into stress granules and P-bodies during long-term starvation (Decker and Parker, 2012). However, to date, it has been difficult to pinpoint the function of RNA granules and other bodies (Decker and Parker, 2012; O'Connell et al., 2012). We show that the movement of Kog1 into bodies acts to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation. This creates hysteresis in the TORC1 pathway and likely helps ensure that cells exposed to low levels of glucose do not try to re-enter a rapid growth state. We suggest that other protein bodies formed during stress and starvation conditions function in a similar way; setting new activation thresholds for key signaling and metabolic pathways. Further work will be needed to test this idea, and to determine if there are differences between the hysteretic behavior created by reversible protein agglomeration and other mechanisms such as feedback loops (Ferrell, 2002)."

These cultures were then used to inoculate 2.5L of fresh media to OD600 0.1 and grown (as above) in 4L flasks until they reached an OD600 of 0.6. At this point cultures were either harvested by filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen (SD sample), or subjected to 0.4M KCl stress, or glucose starvation for 5 min, and harvested by filtration and frozen in liquid nitrogen.",

The cell pellets were then resuspended in chilled lysis buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; P8215), split into 100 OD unit aliquots, and lysed by bead beating (5\u00a0X 20\u00a0s with 30\u00a0s intervals on ice). The lysate was then collected after centrifugation for 5min at 3000rpm and transferred into fresh tubes before being spun down again at 500\u00a0g for 5min at 4\u00b0C. The clarified lysate was then incubated with 100\u00a0\u03bcl protein G Dynal beads + 10\u00a0\u03bcl anti-Flag antibody for 30min at 4\u00b0C. The resin was washed 3 times for 1\u00a0min with 1\u00a0ml lysis buffer at 4\u00b0C and the protein eluted by boiling the beads in 150\u00a0\u03bcl SDS loading buffer for 5min, and loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel (BioRad 161-1155).

Cultures were grown in conical flasks shaking at 200rpm and 30\u00b0C until mid log phase (OD600 between 0.55 and 0.6). At this point, a 47 ml sample was collected, mixed with 3 ml 100% Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and held on ice for at least 30 min (and up to 6 hrs). The remaining culture was then collected by filtration, transferred to the appropriate medium after one wash with 100ml of -Glu medium, and further samples collected in TCA, as described above. The samples were then centrifuged at 4000rpm for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, washed twice with 4\u00b0C water, twice with acetone, and disrupted by sonication at 15% amplitude for 5s before centrifugation at 8000rpm for 30s.

The lysate was then collected after centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm, resuspended into a homogenous slurry, and heated at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. Soluble proteins were then separated from insoluble cell debris by centrifugation at 15,000\u00a0rpm for 5 min, and the lysate stored at -80\u00b0C until required.

                                "Protein mobility shift data were quantified using a custom MATLAB script, described previously in (Hughes Hallett et al., 2014). Briefly, the data in each lane of the gel was simplified by calculating the average signal intensity at each position along the length of the lane, and normalized so that the total signal matches that of the t = 0 control. The normalized data were then used to calculate a position weighted mean for each lane. This was done by defining the first pixel/data point in the gel as 100% phosphorylated and the last pixel in the gel as 0% phosphorylated. Pixels in-between these points were weighted (between 100 and 0) based on their position relative to the top and bottom of the gel (on a linear scale). The values for each position (pixel) were then summed to calculate the total amount of protein phosphorylation in a sample. Finally, since these numbers are in arbitrary units, we normalized all of the values using those found in the wild-type strain under the same conditions. This was done by multiplying the mean phosphorylation values in each strain by constant A, and adding a constant B, so that the values in the wild-type strain at time = 0 min (SD, 2% glucose) are 1.0 and time = 60 min (-G, 0% glucose) are 0.0. Error bars were then scaled using the same constants."

The solution was then removed and the gel slices dried by vacuum centrifugation. Next, the dried gel slices were reduced by covering them with 10\u00a0mM dithiothreitol in 100\u00a0mM ammonium bicarbonate and heating them at 56\u00b0C for 45 min; alkylated by covering them with a solution of 55 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubating in the dark at ambient temperature for 30min, and washed with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10\u00a0min and 50 mM ammonium biocarbonate + 50% acetonitrile for 10 min. The gel slices were then dried again and treated with an ice-cold solution of 12.5 ng/\u03bcL trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After 45 min, the trypsin solution was removed, discarded, and a volume of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added to cover the gel slices and they were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with mixing on a shaker. Samples were then spun down in a microfuge and the supernatant collected. The same Gel slices were then incubated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and acetonitrile, centrifuged, and the supernatant collected. At this point, the digestion supernatant and the extraction supernatant were pooled, split into two tubes, and concentrated using vacuum centrifugation. One tube was further digested with thermolysin (Promega, Madison, WI) by resuspending the tryptically digested peptides with a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 0.5 mM calcium chloride and adding 1 \u03bcg of thermolysin. Digestion was carried out at 75\u00b0C with mixing for 5 hr. The thermolysin was quenched by adding TFA to a 0.5% final concentration. All samples were desalted using ZipTip C18 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and eluted with 70% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA. The desalted material was concentrated to dryness in a speed vac.",

In-line de-salting was accomplished using a reversed-phase trap column (100 \u03bcm \u00d7 20 mm) packed with Magic C18AQ (5-\u03bcm, 200\u00c5 resin; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) followed by peptide separations on a reversed-phase column (75 \u03bcm \u00d7 250 mm) packed with Magic C18AQ (5-\u03bcm, 100\u00c5 resin; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) directly mounted on the electrospray ion source. A 45-min gradient from 2% to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nL/min was used for chromatographic separations. A spray voltage of 2500V was applied to the electrospray tip and the Orbitrap Elite instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode, switching automatically between MS survey scans in the Orbitrap (AGC target value 1,000,000, resolution 120,000, and injection time 250 milliseconds) with collision induced dissociation MS/MS spectra acquisition in the linear ion trap (AGC target value of 10,000 and injection time 100 milliseconds), higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap (AGC target value of 50,000, 15,000 resolution and injection time 250 milliseconds) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) MS/MS spectra acquisition in the Orbitrap (AGC target value of 50,000, 15,000 resolution and injection time 250 milliseconds). The three most intense precursor ions from the Fourier-transform (FT) full scan were consecutively selected for fragmentation in the linear ion trap by CID with a normalized collision energy of 35%, fragmentation in the HCD cell with normalized collision energy of 35%, and fragmentation by ETD with 100 ms activation time. Selected ions were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds.",

The data were searched against the Saccharomyces Genome Database (downloaded 02/03/2011; www.yeastgenome.org) that was appended with protein sequences from the common Repository of Adventitious Proteins or cRAP (www.thegpm.org/crap/). Two searches were performed corresponding to the proteolytic enzymes trypsin, and trypsin/thermolysin (no enzyme selected). The Maximum missed cleavages was set to 2. The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.8 Da. Variable modifications included oxidation on methionine (+ 15.995 Da), carbamidomethyl (+ 57.021 Da) on cysteine, and phosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine (+ 79.996 Da). Sequest HT was used for database searching. PhosphoRS 3.1 (Taus et al., 2011) was used for assigning phosphosite localization probabilities. All search results were run through PSM Validator for false discovery rate evaluation of the identified peptides."
