                        "The promise of antisense oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents has long been recognised, and there are presently considerable interest in developing oligonucleotides to address a large number of diverse medical indications, many of which have been considered undruggable by other means.",
                        "The discovery and pre-clinical and clinical development of oligonucleotide drug candidates is a complex process with considerable focus on identification of the unique combinations of sequence, chemistries and designs which can lead to an optimised molecule with desirable drug like properties.",
                        "One of the major issues in identification of such optimised drug candidates is the event of unpredictable toxicity. When evaluated in vivo, typically a sub-set of antisense compounds will elicit a toxicity phenotype, such as liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity). Over the past few years it has been recognised that in vitro toxicity assays are not predictive of in vivo toxicity (Burdick et al., Nucleic Acids Research, Feb. 18, 2014). For many years, this has meant that preclinical toxicity screening has been performed in vivo, typically in rodents, such as mice and rats. There is however a desire to reduce the use of animals in drug discovery and development, as well as a concern that animal model species may not be predictive of human toxicities.",
                        "Given the previous failure of in vitro cell based assays, pharmaceutical companies have invested in sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms to predict in vivo toxicity. Such approaches are primarily based on the correlation of cryptic oligonucleotide sequence motifs with in vivo datasets, to generate in silico assays (see Hagedorn et al., 2013, Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 23(5) 302-310, and Burdick et al., Nucleic Acids Research, Feb. 18, 2014). Such in silico methods are remarkably effective in predicting in vivo toxicity in mice (for example the algorithm used in Hagedorn et al., accurately predicted about 80% on in vivo toxicities, but they require a substantial data set from in vivo experiments and are inherently limited to the specific chemistry and designs used to generate the in vivo dataset. Recently, Burel et al., has reported that hepatotoxicity of antisense oligonucleotide gapmers is mediated by RNaseH1 dependent promiscuous reduction of very long pre-mRNA transcripts in the liver, raising the possibility that expression profiling or in silico bioinformatics analysis of potential off-targets may be a useful tool in predicting in vivo toxicities. In silico expression profiling can identify potential \u201coff-targets\u201d, but it is not generally predictive of actual off-target activity in vivo, and expression profiling of libraries of oligonucleotides is a resource demanding activity. Furthermore, if such methods are found to be predictive, they are again inherently limited to RNaseH gapmer designs. It is also well recognised that toxicity may be hybridisation independent, and as such transcript profiling is unlikely to identify toxicities which are not related to mRNA hybridisation and RNaseH cleavage.",
                        "Swayze et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jan.; 35(2): 687-700, discloses that some but not all LNA oligonucleotides are hepatotoxic, and uses a transfection based caspase assay in A549 cells.",
                        "There is therefore a general need to provide predictive assays for in vivo and clinical toxicity of oligonucleotides."

In an important aspect of the invention, primary mammalian hepatocytes are used in an in vitro toxicity assay for assessing or predicting the toxicity potential of oligonucleotides. The present inventors have also identified certain molecular markers of toxicity, which when used in the primary mammalian hepatocyte assay have been found to be predictive of the in vivo toxicity profile. By correlating a panel of compounds whose toxicity profile has been characterized from human clinical trials, the inventors have also shown that not only are the methods of present invention predictive of in vivo toxicity in model species, such as mouse or rat, but they are also predictive of the toxicity in humans.",

In this respect, the prediction of in vivo toxicity may be an assessment of the comparative risk of encountering a toxicity phenotype, such as hepatotoxicity, when the oligonucleotide(s) are administered in vivo in a mammal.",

The methods of the present invention therefore allows the selection of oligonucleotides which do not exhibit dose limiting toxicity (e.g. hepatotoxicity) when used in vivo at effective dosages. It will be recognised that it is an advantage to have a wide safely margin when selecting oligonucleotides for in vivo or for therapeutic use, and as such the methods of the invention may be used to identify or select oligonucleotides which do not elicit in vivo toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity, when dosed effectively, or at higher doses, e.g. at up to 2\u00d7 the effective dose, or up to 3\u00d7 the effective dose, or up to 5\u00d7 the effective dose, or up to 10\u00d7 the effective dose.

In this regard the methods of the invention may be used to select oligonucleotides which have a suitable therapeutic index (TI) for safe therapeutic administration (The therapeutic index may be calculated by the following formula TI=in vivo potency ED50/maximum tolerated dose)."

                                "The oligonucleotide is administered to the population of primary hepatocyte cells in vitro in the absence of a transfection agent. Uptake of the oligonucleotide into the primary hepatocyte cells occurs through the process known as gymnosis (also known as naked delivery, see Stein et al., NAR 2010 38(1) e3 or Soifer et al., Methods Mol Biol 2012, 815: 333-46)). Since its discovery over 5 years ago, gymontic delivery has become a standard tool used in oligonucleotide research, and is a well-established term used in the art. Typically, gymnotic delivery of oligonucleotides utilises a concentration of oligonucleotide of between about 1 \u03bcM and about 1000 \u03bcM, such as between about 5 \u03bcM and about 100 \u03bcM, such as between about 10 \u03bcM and about 50 \u03bcM, such as between about 20 \u03bcM and 40 \u03bcM such as about 25-35 \u03bcM. Suitably oligonucleotides may be administered to the cell culture, e.g. in PBS, to achieve a final concentration of 1-100 \u03bcM, such as 5-50 \u03bcM, such as 10 or 30 \u03bcM.",
                                "Gymnotic delivery requires a period of time between administering the oligonucleotide and measuring the biological effect of the oligonucleotide. Typically, for gymnotic delivery this period is at least 7-14 days in length. The present inventors have identified that in the methods of the invention a shorter culturing step may be used for example about 1-about 7 days, such as about 1-about 4 days, or about 1-about 3 days, or about 2-about 4 days, such as about 2-about 3 days such as about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, or about 7 days in length. In some embodiments, the culturing step is about 2 days, or about 3 days or about 4 days. Cell culture of mammalian cells is typically performed at or about 37\u00b0 C., and may further comprise exogenous CO2, such kept in an atmosphere of or about 5% CO2. One of the advantages of the present invention is the early read out of predictive toxicity biomarkers, relatively shortly after the initiation of the culturing period, and that the biomarkers used provide a reliable signal. In this respect, whereas caspase have been used extensively in the art to determine in vitro toxicity (by using transfection (e.g. See Swayze et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Jan.; 35(2): 687-700), caspase gives a relatively transient signal which is not suited to end-point analysis and is generally not suited to assays based upon end point analysis after gymnotic delivery of the oligonucleotide.",

Removal of one or more terminal high affinity nucleosides, such as a LNA nucleoside allows for the affinity of the oligonucleotide to the RNA target to be maintained, as the insertion of one or more LNA nucleosides into the gap region will increase the affinity to the RNA target. It is envisaged that, in some embodiments, the library of child oligonucleotides may comprise variants which have different flank regions, some being truncated, some having additional nucleosides, some having a sequence shifted one or two nucleosides (as measured to the RNA target), some with additional high affinity nucleosides in the flanks, so the library is a complex library of stereodefined phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with heterogeneous phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages, thereby allowing for the concurrent selection of child oligonucleotides which have a decreased toxicity as compared to the parent.",

In addition or alternatively in some embodiments, a proportion of the child oligonucleotides may be truncated with regards the parent, e.g. may comprise 1, 2 or ant truncation at the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end. In some embodiments, additional nucleobase or truncations of the nucleobase sequence of the (proportion of) child oligonucleotide(s) is a single nucleobase addition or truncation. In some embodiments, the child oligonucleotides, or a proportion thereof, may be shifted by a single nucleobase, or by 2 or 3 nucleobases in comparison to the parent oligonucleotide when aligned to the target sequence (in effect a truncation at one end, and an addition at the other). Additional nucleotides retain complementarity with the target nucleic acid sequence."

                                "Non modified DNA and RNA molecules are rapidly degraded in vivo, and as such are of little use therapeutically. Typically, the oligonucleotide(s) used in the method of the invention are therefore modified. One widely used modification is the use of phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages, which is known to stabilise oligonucleotides from nucleolytic degradation, as well as providing desirable pharmacological properties. In some embodiments the oligonucleotide(s) comprise phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. Another desirable modification are those which confer higher affinity of the oligonucleotide, so called high affinity modified nucleotides, which include bicyclic \u201cLNA\u201d nucleosides as well as numerous 2\u2032 substituted nucleosides.",

                                "In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises one or more high affinity modified nucleoside. A high affinity modified nucleoside is a modified nucleotide which, when incorporated into the oligonucleotide enhances the affinity of the oligonucleotide for its complementary target, for example as measured by the melting temperature (Tm). A high affinity modified nucleoside of the present invention preferably result in an increase in melting temperature between +0.5 to +12\u00b0 C., more preferably between +1.5 to +10\u00b0 C. and most preferably between +3 to +8\u00b0 C. per modified nucleoside. Numerous high affinity modified nucleosides are known in the art and include for example, many 2\u2032 substituted nucleosides as well as locked nucleic acids (LNA) (see e.g. Freier & Altmann; Nucl. Acid Res., 1997, 25, 4429-4443 and Uhlmann; Curr. Opinion in Drug Development, 2000, 3(2), 293-213).",

                                "Numerous nucleosides with modification of the ribose sugar moiety have been made, primarily with the aim of improving certain properties of oligonucleotides, such as affinity and/or nuclease resistance.",
                                "Such modifications include those where the ribose ring structure is modified, e.g. by replacement with a hexose ring (HNA), or a bicyclic ring, which typically have a biradicle bridge between the C2 and C4 carbons on the ribose ring (LNA), or an unlinked ribose ring which typically lacks a bond between the C2 and C3 carbons (e.g. UNA). Other sugar modified nucleosides include, for example, bicyclohexose nucleic acids (WO2011/017521) or tricyclic nucleic acids (WO2013/154798). Modified nucleosides also include nucleosides where the sugar moiety is replaced with a non-sugar moiety, for example in the case of peptide nucleic acids (PNA), or morpholino nucleic acids.",
                                "Sugar modifications also include modifications made via altering the substituent groups on the ribose ring to groups other than hydrogen, or the 2\u2032-OH group naturally found in DNA and RNA nucleosides. Substituents may, for example be introduced at the 2\u2032, 3\u2032, 4\u2032 or 5\u2032 positions. Nucleosides with modified sugar moieties also include 2\u2032 modified nucleosides, such as 2\u2032 substituted nucleosides. Indeed, much focus has been spent on developing 2\u2032 substituted nucleosides, and numerous 2\u2032 substituted nucleosides have been found to have beneficial properties when incorporated into oligonucleotides, such as enhanced nucleoside resistance and enhanced affinity.",

For example, the 2\u2032 modified sugar may provide enhanced binding affinity and/or increased nuclease resistance to the oligonucleotide. Examples of 2\u2032 substituted modified nucleosides are 2\u2032-O-alkyl-RNA, 2\u2032-O-methyl-RNA, 2\u2032-alkoxy-RNA, 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl-RNA (MOE), 2\u2032-amino-DNA, 2\u2032-Fluoro-RNA, and 2\u2032-F-ANA nucleoside.

In contrast, albumin secretion was not notably changed compared to vehicle treated hepatocytes for all ASOs tested indicating that this may not be a sensitive marker for oligonucleotide induced toxicity in this setting (FIG. 2B). In order to assess the potential of ASOs to induce oxidative stress, intracellular GSH content was determined after 3 day treatment. Hepatotoxic ASOs 37, 43 and 47 induced a clear reduction in glutathione levels in mouse hepatocyte cultures and ASO 36 showed a very mild reduction in GSH. Safe ASOs 32, 33 and 35 did not change GSH levels compared to vehicle (FIG. 2C). A similar picture was obtained when assessing intracellular ATP levels which clearly revealed a differentiation between toxic and safe ASOs. Cellular ATP levels were slightly reduced in hepatocytes treated with safe ASOs 32, 33 and 35 compared to the vehicle group, but this effect was small and not concentration-dependent. Treatment with hepatotoxic ASOs, 37, 43 and 47 led to a marked reduction in ATP while ASO 36 showed a concentration dependent mild reduction in intracellular ATP concentration (FIG. 2D)."

Cellular ATP and secreted LDH were selected as readouts after 3 days of treatment in freshly isolated mouse hepatocyte monocultures, as these two assay turned out to be sufficient to recapitulate the in vivo toxicity pattern with our initial set of tool ASOs. As shown in FIG. 7 with this broad set of oligonucleotides, there is a good correlation of the in vivo hepatotoxicity with in vitro readouts, with ASOs that induced increases in plasma ALT levels in vivo also clearly showing an increase in LDH and a reduction in ATP levels in vitro.

Toxic ASOs 37 and 43 showed a dose dependent increase in LDH levels and decrease in intracellular ATP levels, whereas ASOs 32, 33 and 35 had no apparent effect.
