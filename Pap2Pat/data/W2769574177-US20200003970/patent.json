    "abstract": "A grating coupler is disclosed. The grating coupler comprises a grating formed in a waveguide formed in a silicon layer of a silicon on insulator photonic component. The grating has a series of sequentially arranged grating elements i, each comprising an alternating etched trench section having a length Le and an etch depth e, and an unetched tooth section having a length L0. Each grating element has a total length of \u039bi and a fill factor Fi. The fill factor Fi of each grating element varies across the grating coupler according to an apodization function dependent on the location of the grating element. The total length of each grating element \u039bi varies across the grating coupler such that the effective refractive index of each grating element causes the Bragg condition to be satisfied for all of the grating elements of the grating.",

                        "Silicon photonics is currently a fast growing and increasingly mature technology that enables the production of low-cost, highly scalable integrated optical devices including circuits and components designed for applications in, for example, high speed optical communications, sensing and experimental physics. In particular, silicon photonics is revolutionizing the field of optical communications, allowing the realization of compact, low power circuits that can be seamlessly integrated to electrical circuits, thus allowing for dense integration of optical circuits.",
                        "Integrated optical components such as modulators, optical filters, photodetectors, arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), couplers, wavelength division multiplexers and all-optical wavelength converters have successfully been demonstrated, showing that multiple functions can be effectively integrated in a single integrated photonic chip. As these components can be now realized in \u03bcm-scale circuits, compact low power silicon photonic devices are able to replace bulk components. For example, silicon photonic optical transceivers, packaged in standard QSFP28 form factor, are now available, supporting speeds up to 100 Gb/s, usable for high speed intra-data centre connections, which allows the replacement of copper cables and other bulk components.",
                        "Although the technology is already relatively mature, some significant technical challenges need to be addressed. In particular, compatibility with the existing optical fiber infrastructure is a primary concern and a high efficiency coupling device, to enable light to be coupled from fiber to chip, is highly desirable. However, it is currently very difficult to reliably and effectively provide a high efficiency coupler from fiber to chip, for the following reason.",
                        "Considering Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology, the strong refractive index difference between Si and SiO2 allows the implementation of very small, single mode waveguide structures. On one side this enables dense on-chip device integration, but on the other side it makes efficient coupling of light into and out of waveguide structures formed in the Silicon layer of the SOI wafer from another photonic component external to the silicon on insulator waveguide, such as an optical fiber, particularly challenging. The reason for this is that there is a significant difference between the mode field area of the light as it propagates in the optical fiber (\u224880 \u03bcm2) and the light as it propagates in the SOI waveguides (<0.2 \u03bcm2). The large size mismatch between the optical mode of a single mode fiber (SMF) and a typical silicon photonic waveguide usually leads to large optical coupling losses that are in the range of 1.5-4 dB/coupler. These losses currently represent the main limiting factor for the practical realization of silicon photonic complex circuits.",

                        "The present disclosure provides extremely highly efficient integrated optical couplers that are able to interface single mode fiber to silicon photonic circuits with optical loss lower than 0.9 dB/coupler, with the methods needed to design and fabricate the couplers requiring only CMOS-compliant processes and is fully compatible with the current state of the art Silicon On Insulator (SOI) fabrication protocol, requiring no additional processing that would increase costs and limit scalability.",
                        "Currently, the most widely adopted form of coupler for coupling light into and out of an integrated silicon waveguide, has been the diffractive grating coupler. These couplers are provided by a series of diffractive grating elements formed in an integrated silicon waveguide, obtained by selectively etching sections of a straight optical integrated waveguide at a certain etch depth, thus obtaining a grating pattern (composed of a sequence of etched and non-etched regions). The etched grating allows a light beam (originating e.g. from an optical fiber, waveguide or free space) that propagates at a direction nearly perpendicular to the grating plane to be coupled to the fundamental optical mode of the integrated waveguide, and vice versa. However, these grating couplers have relatively high coupling losses, typically of 1.5 dB/device in the best case scenario.",
                        "In order to reduce this loss figure, various techniques have been proposed but they usually require additional fabrication processes that are not compliant with the standard CMOS chain, making the fabrication significantly more expensive and technically challenging. For example, it has been proposed to provide grating couplers with metallic back-reflectors. The embedded back-reflector significantly increases the device coupling efficiency, with reduced coupling losses as low as 0.7 dB/device being demonstrated. However, the additional fabrication processes required to integrate the metallic mirror present a significant drawback as these additional steps are not CMOS compatible and significantly increase the cost per unit of the final device.",
                        "However, the present disclosure builds on the simplicity and practicality of the standard CMOS fabrication approach of providing integrated grating couplers, by providing a design of a diffractive grating that can improve the coupling achieved with this technique by as much as 1 dB without complicating the fabrication process any further.",
                        "In particular, and as described in more detail below, the present disclosure provides a grating coupler for coupling light between a silicon on insulator waveguide and another photonic component external to the silicon on insulator waveguide, in which the fill factor of each grating element (representing the proportion of the grating element that is etched/unetched) varies across the grating according to an apodisation function dependent on the location of each grating element, and in which the total length of each grating element is set such that the Bragg condition is satisfied for each grating element across the grating. The apodisation function may be a linear apodisation function, so that the fill factor varies linearly across the grating. There are also disclosed photonic apparatuses comprising an SOI photonic component having an integrated waveguide formed in a silicon layer thereof, the waveguide having formed therein a grating coupler as disclosed in the present application.",
                        "There are also disclosed methods of designing the apodised grating, including a design process by which the parameters of the apodisation function and/or the etch depth that give an optimal or required coupling efficiency are selected. There are also disclosed methods of fabricating apodised gratings by selectively etching silicon in an SOI waveguide according to an apodised grating design developed in accordance with the present disclosure. Non-transitory computer readable media are disclosed for implementing in a controller the disclosed methods for the design and fabrication of the apodised gratings. Methods of using the apodised gratings are also disclosed.",
                        "The apodised grating in which the fill factor is apodised across the grating while the length of each grating element is adjusted to satisfy the Bragg condition, allows extremely high efficiency grating coupler devices to be obtained, showing coupling efficiency levels greater than 80% (i.e. less than 0.9 dB losses) without the need to use any non-CMOS compatible materials in the fabrication chain.",

                        "Referring now to FIG. 1, this shows a schematic drawing of a cross-section of a general layout of a grating coupler 110 formed in a Silicon On Insulator wafer 100, showing the main structural elements thereof.",
                        "The Silicon On Insulator wafer 100 is formed of a stack of at least three layers including a bulk support layer, or handle layer, 101, an electrically insulating buried oxide layer, or BOX layer, 102, and an active layer, or device layer, 103.",
                        "The handle layer 101 is typically formed of a relatively thick layer of silicon (200-1000 \u03bcm thick) serving as a support for the active wafer components above. The BOX layer 102 is typically formed of a relatively thin layer of silica SiO2 (0.1-20 \u03bcm thick), serving to isolate the device layer 103 from the handle layer 101. The device layer itself 103 is formed of a typically thin layer of silicon or one of its compounds such as silicon nitride or silicon germanium (typically 150-700 nm thick) which can be etched, and patterned and doped to form one or more photonic active or passive integrated photonic components in an optical circuit in the device layer 103, which may also include one or more integrated electronic components to form a hybrid device. The device layer material may comprise one or more of a top oxide TOX layer, or cladding layer, 104, of silica may be formed on top of the device layer to protect and isolate the photonic components formed thereon.",
                        "Silicon is transparent to infrared light above 1.1 \u03bcm and can therefore transmit light, for example, at 1300 nm or 1550 nm, emitted by laser diodes and VCSELs, for communications and networking applications.",
                        "To guide the light within the device layer 103, the device layer 103 can be etched down to the BOX layer 102 to form a strip (or at least partway down to form a rib) configured to guide the light along the remaining unetched silicon device layer material as in a waveguide. The relatively high refractive index of silicon of around 3.5 provides tight optical confinement of light within the silicon waveguide, whereas the relatively low refractive index of silica of around 1.44 in the BOX layer and cladding ensures that the guided light undergoes total internal reflection as it passes along the waveguide.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 1, the cross section of the SOI wafer 100 is along a section of the device layer incorporating a waveguide. The waveguide is typically on the order of a few hundreds of nm in width, but in the area shown in FIG. 1, the waveguide has been tapered out to 12 \u03bcm in width and into which a diffractive grating coupler 110 has been etched.",
                        "The diffractive grating coupler 110 is provided of a series of grating elements 110a, 110b, 110c . . . 110n (referred to herein generally grating elements 110i) formed and sequentially arranged in the tapered section of the waveguide. Each grating element 110i has an alternating etched trench section having a length Le and an etch depth e, and an unetched tooth section having a length L0 and an unetched height h.",
                        "Each grating element thus has a total length of \u039b=L0+Le, and a fill factor F which is the ratio between the length of the unetched tooth section L0 (or the etched trench section Le) to the total length of the grating element \u039b.",
                        "In a conventional (uniform) grating coupler, the grating elements are formed by etching plural trenches having a length Le and depth e in a silicon waveguide of an SOI device layer with a constant periodicity, such that the total length \u039b and fill factor F of each grating element i is constant.",
                        "Here, the effective refractive index of the grating, neff, can be expressed as shown in Equation (1).",
                        "neff=F\u00b7n0+(1\u2212F)ne\u2003\u2003(1)",
                        "where n0 and ne are the effective indices of the original silicon device layer slab and the etched areas respectively.",
                        "As light passing through the waveguide intersects the grating coupler, the periodic refractive index change between the trench sections and the adjacent un-etched teeth sections allows the optical mode propagating in the silicon waveguide to be diffracted to free space in a direction dependent on the geometry of the grating elements and their effective refractive index, such that each grating element acts as a scattering or radiative unit.",
                        "In particular, the diffraction behaviour of the light in relation to the grating elements is given by the Bragg condition, which relates the diffraction angle of the light in air \u03b8air coupled into or out of the grating to the wavelength of the coupled light \u03bbc, the refractive index of the grating neff and the total length of each grating element \u039b. That is, as given by the first order Bragg condition shown in Equation (2), the central angle of coupling light in/out of the grating is that at which diffracted light from each grating coupler constructively interferes.",
                        "\\(\\begin{matrix}\n{\\Lambda = \\frac{\\lambda_{c}}{\\left( {n_{eff} - {\\sin \ue89e\\; \ue89e\\theta_{c}}} \\right)}} & (2)\n\\end{matrix}\\)",
                        "Thus a photonic component external to the silicon on insulator waveguide, such as an optical fiber 120 may couple light into or out of the grating coupler 110 if it is aligned with the coupler at a coupling beam angle of incidence of \u03b8c.",
                        "However, the main drawbacks of conventional uniform grating couplers are their narrow bandwidth (usually between 30-40 nm, less than half of edge-coupling solutions) and the relatively low coupling efficiency (CE), which is usually lower than 61% (a 2.15 dB loss). The relatively low coupling efficiency can be attributed to two main factors: grating directionality and mode mismatch. Considering a beam coupling from the SOI waveguide to a fiber, a low grating directionality 65%) means that a large percentage of the optical power incident on the grating coupler is diffracted towards the substrate (\u224835%) instead of being sent towards the fiber. The mode mismatch limitation is due to the fact that the optical intensity profile radiated by a uniform grating shows an almost exponential-decay shape with a reduced overlap integral with the mode profile (almost Gaussian) of standard optical fibers.",
                        "In order to improve the coupling efficiency of conventional uniform grating couplers without introducing any additional non-CMOS compliant processes, it is possible to tailor the amount of optical power scattered by each element of the grating, so as to reduce the mode mismatch between the radiated field profile and the optical mode in a single-mode fiber. Approaches to achieving this have been proposed to vary either the etching depth or the fill-factor of each grating element, and to optimise the grating design of the varied etching depth and fill factor using a complicated Genetic Algorithm as an optimisation method starting from a simple starting structure. These techniques, in addition to being computationally intensive and time-consuming, do not allow a real physical insight as to why a particular pattern of grating fill factors for etching the sequential grating element yields an increase in coupling efficiency. However, this approach of using Genetic Algorithms alone can still not achieve an increase in coupling efficiency to a level close to that achieved by the use of back reflectors.",
                        "The present disclosure, however, provides an approach to designing and fabricating grating couplers having a non-uniform grating pattern that is not computationally intensive and gives a significant improvement in coupling efficiency that follows directly from the physical design principles.",
                        "That is, in accordance with the present disclosure, grating couplers can be designed and fabricated in which:",
                        "(a) the fill factor Fi of each grating element i varies across the grating coupler according to an apodization function dependent on the location of the grating element; and\n\n(b) the total length \u039bi of each grating element i varies across the grating coupler such that the effective refractive index of each grating element causes the Bragg condition to be satisfied for all of the grating elements of the grating.",
                        "In detail, starting from the basic structure of a uniform GC, in accordance with the present disclosure, the fill factor F of the grating elements i is adjusted across the grating coupler in accordance with an apodization function such that each grating element i has a different fill factor Fi, such that the grating is apodised. The parameters of the apodization function may be set in the design process so as to define the apodization of the grating elements (i.e. the setting of the fill factor) across the grating. In examples, the apodization function is a linear apodization function having an apodization factor R, where the apodization function is set out in Equation (3) below.",
                        "Fi=F0\u2212R\u00b7zi\u2003\u2003(3)",
                        "where Fi is the fill-factor of the grating element i, F0 is the initial fill-factor of the first grating element (i.e. the first radiative unit i=0), R is the linear apodization factor and zi is the distance of the grating element i from the starting point of the grating (i.e. z0).",
                        "Using a linear apodization function to linearly vary the value of Fi across the grating elements i provides advantageous effects that the amount of optical power radiated by the first elements of the grating is reduced, and that the optical impedance matching between the waveguide and the grating section is improved. However, while linear apodization and the advantages resulting therefrom is used as a detailed example in this disclosure, the apodization function is not limited to being a linear function. Rather the apodization function may be any appropriate mathematical function that may have similar advantageous effects that can be defined and determined using a deterministic algorithm, such that the function is determined by a set of parameter values or chosen constants, and provides a unique output value for any input value in its domain.",
                        "Referring again to FIG. 1, it can be seen that the grating coupler 110 is linearly apodized such that the successive grating elements 110a,b,c . . . n have a decreasing fill factor, or rather, the etched section becomes proportionally longer.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 2 now to look in more detail at the grating coupler design, here there is shown a grating coupler 210 formed of a series of linearly apodized grating elements in which the fill factor is decreased linearly for each grating element i as with increasing distance from the starting location z0 of the first grating element i=0, such that the grating elements have an etched trench section that forms an increasingly larger proportion of the grating elements. The dotted lines indicate the start of each successive grating element, and as can be seen, in the linearly apodized grating as shown in 210, the spacing between these is even. It is important to highlight that Equation (3) describes the evolution of F along the grating, but does not impose any limitation on \u039b, the grating element length. Thus, a uniform grating coupler adapted to have a linearly apodised fill factor as shown in 210 will have a uniform grating element size, such that the total grating element length \u039b is constant.",
                        "However, in accordance with the present disclosure, it is recognized that, where a grating coupler is linearly apodized and \u039b is constant along the whole grating as for conventional gratings, this arrangement leads to the Bragg condition not being satisfied along the length of the grating. That is, as F is varied along the grating, it is hereby realised that the effective index neff of each grating element resultingly changes, which causes the Bragg condition to no longer be satisfied across the grating and instead, the Bragg condition is satisfied only at a specific point of the grating (not along the whole structure). As a result, the coupling of light into and out of the apodized grating coupler 210 is actually less efficient than for a uniform coupler, which is why an additional loss of 1.2 dB results.",
                        "To achieve an increased coupling efficiency from apodised grating couplers without using genetic algorithms or non-CMOS compliant processing, the present disclosure provides an additional requirement in the design of the grating coupler that has a linear apodisation of F that the total grating element length \u039b is not constant, but is instead a parameter that is varied along the structure, so as to satisfy the Bragg condition along the whole grating. That is shown in the grating coupler 220 of FIG. 2, which is aligned at z0 with the grating coupler 210, but in which it can be seen that, as the index of the grating elements increases, the start of each grating element i of the grating coupler 220 becomes increasingly out of alignment with the start of each grating element i of the grating coupler 210. This is despite the fill factor of the equivalent grating elements being the same between the grating couplers 210 and 220. The reason for this is that the total length of each grating element \u039bi is not constant, such that \u039bi\u2260\u039bi+1.",
                        "Thus instead of maintaining the total length of each grating element \u039bi constant prevents the grating from satisfying the Bragg condition simultaneously for all the grating elements, the grating coupler 220 is designed and fabricated such that the total length of each grating element \u039bi is adjusted for the apodized fill factor Fi for that grating element, such that the Bragg condition is satisfied for that grating element. That is, for each grating element i, in addition to the fill factor Fi being apodized, the total length of each grating element \u039bi is adjusted in accordance with the Bragg condition in Equation (4).",

                        "Using the obtained values of neff for a given etch depth from mode simulations and from Equation (6), given apodization function parameters (e.g. a value of R for linear apodisation) and for a beam to be coupled in/out of the integrated waveguide coupler with a given wavelength \u03bbc (e.g. 1550 nm) and a given coupling angle of incidence \u03b8c (e.g. 14.5 degrees), the length of the tooth section L0,i and the length of the trench section Le,i of each grating element i can be calculated using Equation (4).",

It is worth noting that the coupling wavelength \u03bbc and diffraction angle \u03b8c represent the wavelength and angle values at the interface between the grating of the silicon waveguide and the material facing the waveguide. For example, where a silica TOX cladding layer 104 is provided, the values of coupling wavelength \u03bbc and diffraction angle \u03b8c may be different from the values for the wavelength and diffraction angle on exit from the external waveguide where the light exits the fiber into air or another index coupling material.",

A top SiO2 TOX cladding layer, also having a refractive index of 1.44 at 1550 nm, was included in the layout, having a height of 680 nm. Trenches forming the grating coupler were assumed to be completely filled by the TOX cladding and no index-matching liquid was considered between the TOX cladding and the fiber. An angle of incidence of coupled light of \u03b8c=10 degrees was set in the TOX layer 104 (corresponding to an angle of incidence of the fiber 120 in air above the TOX cladding layer 104 of 14.5 degrees).",

In the example, this corresponds to a minimum etched feature size of 60 nm, which gives a value of F0 of 0.9.",

The etch depth e and the linear apodization factor value R were swept together, to arrive at grating designs for all possible combinations thereof. For each of these designs, the Bragg condition is satisfied across the length of the grating due to the design process.",
                        "To evaluate the coupling efficiency of the plurality of grating designs for each value of e and R, fully vectorial 2D-FDTD simulations using FDTD Solutions\u2122 from Lumerical Inc. were carried out by creating a model of each grating design in use in accordance with FIG. 1. In the model, the coupling efficiency was evaluated by considering the grating as an in-coupling device, i.e. coupling light from the SMF 120 into the SOI waveguide by means of the grating coupler, and a physical model of the SOI etched with the coupler designs was produced. In accordance with the model, the fiber 120 (which was assumed to have an outer diameter of 125 \u03bcm and a mode field diameter (MFD) of 10.4 \u03bcm), was tilted by \u03b8air=14.5 degrees with respect to the vertical direction (corresponding to an incidence angle on the grating \u03b8c=10 degrees in the TOX), causing the Gaussian beam output from the fiber 120 to impinge on the TOX with a MFD of about 10.8 \u03bcm. In the model, the electric field of the Gaussian beam was polarized along the x direction with reference to FIG. 1, so that the incoming light could be coupled to the fundamental TE mode of the integrated waveguide. A frequency-domain power monitor, positioned along the Si waveguide at a 10 \u03bcm distance from the grating, was used in the model to measure the amount of optical power coupled to the waveguide.",

                        "However, referring to the full data in the contour plot, it can be seen that the peak in the coupling efficiency across all values of e and R can be achieved to maximise the coupling efficiency at 83% (representing a loss of only \u22120.8 dB) for e=160 nm and R=0.025 \u03bcm\u22121. If the etch depth is further increased, the coupling efficiency starts to decrease, with a value of 68% (\u22121.7 dB) when e=230 nm and R=0.025 \u03bcm\u22121. Significantly, as can be seen, the simulated coupling efficiency is higher than 80% for a wide range of (e, R) combinations, thus showing a good tolerance to small variations in the fabrication process. This is not necessarily the case for genetic algorithm-derived solutions which tend to be less stable and tolerant of manufacturing variations, meaning that the coupling efficiency can drop off significantly for these GA-derived grating designs even within normal manufacturing tolerances.",
                        "The same procedure used for the design of the optimized apodized grating coupler based on the 260 nm SOI platform, was also applied to the 220 nm SOI grating, achieving a maximum coupling efficiency of 70% (\u22121.6 dB) when e=110 nm and R=0.0275 \u03bcm\u22121. It can be seen that by using a SOI platform with the thicker of the two Si layers it is possible to obtain a higher CE, and that deep etching levels (110 nm and 160 nm for the 220 nm and 260 nm SOI platforms, respectively) are required to obtain the maximum CE.",
                        "Further simulations of the optimised 260 nm SOI waveguide operating as an outcoupling device were conducted, placing a fundamental-mode waveguide source in the Si waveguide, a power-monitor above the grating coupler to assess its directionality and an additional power-monitor in the Si-layer to assess grating reflectivity by measuring the optical power reflected back in the waveguide. The simulated directionality and reflectivity results were compared with those modelled for an equivalent uniform (non-apodised) grating (having a constant fill factor F=0.5 and grating element length) realized in the same SOI platform, and a 10% improvement in the directionality maximum was observed for the apodised grating of the present disclosure, with a significantly reduced reflectivity.",

As can be seen, the value of the initial fill factor F0=0.9 corresponds to an initial trench size in the first period of 60 nm, matching the minimum feature size achievable by the CMOS masking and lithography system 451 available to the applicant for fabrication and experimental testing of the optimized grating design.",

This may be achieved in any suitable known way without limitation by, for example, selectively illuminating a photoresist layer formed on the surface of the SOI wafer 461 using a photolithographic mask, and washing away the illuminated areas of the photoresist to expose the device layer of the silicon on insulator waveguide 461 in a pattern corresponding to the grating coupler design data 405 (in the example experiment, as represented in Table 1). Then the CMOS masking and lithography system 451 may perform one or more chemical etches of the exposed sections to the etch depth e specified by the design data 405 (in the example experiment e=160 nm), to form a grating in the silicon waveguide having etched trench sections according to the selected waveguide design. Any other suitable process for selectively etching the grating design into the Si device layer waveguide may be used, without limitation. The SOI waveguide may subsequently be clad with a TOX cladding layer.",

An optical micrograph of this is shown in FIG. 7. As can be seen, the fabricated grating was 12 \u03bcm wide along the x direction, to properly accommodate the Gaussian mode of the fiber, and 14.847 \u03bcm long across the 24 grating elements in accordance with the design. In accordance with the grating design 220 shown in FIG. 2, the fabricated grating design is linearly apodised and the total length of each grating element is controlled to satisfy the Bragg condition across the length of the grating.",

Two such structures were fabricated, with the only difference being that the connecting waveguides had different lengths of 5.2 mm and 30.2 mm, so as to allow separation out of the loss contributions resulting from beam propagation from those resulting from beam coupling. The waveguides were connected to the gratings by 500 \u03bcm long linear tapers. In the fabrication process in the experiment, the CMOS masking and lithography system 451 used Electron Beam Lithography (E-beam) to define the grating pattern in accordance with the design, and Inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching to etch and define the final grating structures. A protective TOX layer was finally deposited by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).",

The optical source was a PM external cavity laser (ECL), tunable from 1523 to 1600 nm at 5 \u03bcm steps, and a power meter was used to measure the output optical power collected from the test structures. The grating coupling efficiency was obtained by subtracting the waveguide propagation loss from the measured fiber-to-fiber transmission and dividing by two (thus assuming that the input and output coupling losses were equal).",

The parasitic amplitude ripple affecting the grating transmission spectrum may be caused by the transition between the taper and the single-mode waveguide. As can be seen, the maximum experimental coupling efficiency for the fabricated device was measured to be \u22120.9 dB, showing a very good agreement with the theoretical coupling efficiency values (\u22120.8 dB, i.e. 83%), and indicating a good consistency in the fabrication process. Further, the measured \u22121 dB bandwidth of the device of 37.4 nm is rather wide.",

Similarly, the losses achieved in the present disclosure are less than that observed for a Genetic-Algorithm derived grating design in an equivalent Si-depth SOI platform (\u22121.0 dB theoretical) and are much easier to design and reliably fabricate.",

While in theory, this apodized structure in a thicker 340 nm Si-thick SOI wafer is predicted to obtain losses of \u22120.8 dB, the relatively large deviation between theoretical and experimental data can probably be associated to the high aspect ratio of the required trenches (>4.5 compared to 2.7 in the structures of the present disclosure), whose proper fabrication can be quite challenging.",
                        "Further, the level of the losses achieved in the grating couplers of the present disclosure is also quite close the record loss value of \u22120.62 dB which was achieved using an Al back-reflector in a 250 nm Si-thick SOI wafer, which requires additional, non-CMOS compliant processing to be fabricated.",
                        "Thus by designing and fabricating a grating coupler in accordance the present disclosure, a very high coupling efficiency, below the \u22121 dB threshold, can be obtained even without the use of any back-reflector or additional, non-CMOS compliant processing.",
                        "The grating coupler approach disclosed herein also offers significant advantages compared to the main alternative technique that does not use grating couplers, which is \u201cedge\u201d or \u201cbutt\u201d coupling, in which a single mode fiber is arranged to face against and couple light into and out of a silicon photonic waveguide in an SOI wafer. This solution adopts inverse tapers to match the single mode fiber optical mode to the silicon photonic waveguide allowing a smooth transition between the fiber and the silicon photonic waveguides. In this approach, the fabrication of the coupling components on the SOI device can also be made by using CMOS compatible processes only. However, very precise alignment between the single mode fiber and the coupling device is needed in order to achieve low coupling losses. That is, while optimum alignments can lead to low coupling losses of about 0.7 dB/coupler, even a small deviation from the optimum point usually leads to a significant increase in coupling losses (typically a deviation of \u00b11 \u03bcm in the longitudinal axis causes 2 dB additional losses). Thus this approach is not particularly practical and has not been widely adopted.",
                        "In contrast, grating coupler devices designed in accordance with the present disclosure show only an additional 0.5 dB loss when a fiber misalignment of 1 \u03bcm is present on the longitudinal axis, leading to an \u22121.5 dB improvement with respect to the butt coupling approach (under similar conditions). This leads to significantly improved fiber alignment tolerances.",
                        "Further, the grating couplers of the present disclosure are easy to fabricate using standard CMOS fabrication processes and can be put anywhere on the chip, thus allowing for easier wafer-level testing, whereas edge-couplers, despite their potentially good performance in terms of coupling efficiency, restrict the chip architecture, require complicated fabrication processes (such as high-quality chip facets polishing), and show high sensitivity to fiber misalignment.",
                        "Thus the presently disclosed grating design and fabrication method allows for the first time a grating coupler to be obtained achieving coupling with less than 1 dB loss for an SOI wafer having an Si device layer thickness of less than 340 nm and without using a back-reflector.",
                        "While the claimed invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to the illustrated and preferred examples thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."
