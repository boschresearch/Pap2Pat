    "title": "Species-Specific Chromosome Engineering Greatly Improves Fully Human Polyclonal Antibody Production Profile in Cattle",
    "date": "2015-06-24",
    "abstract": "Large-scale production of fully human IgG (hIgG) or human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) by transgenic animals could be useful for human therapy. However, production level of hpAbs in transgenic animals is generally very low, probably due to the fact that evolutionarily unique interspecies-incompatible genomic sequences between human and non-human host species may impede high production of fully hIgG in the non-human environment. To address this issue, we performed species-specific human artificial chromosome (HAC) engineering and tested these engineered HAC in cattle. Our previous study has demonstrated that site-specific genomic chimerization of pre-B cell receptor/B cell receptor (pre-BCR/BCR) components on HAC vectors significantly improves human IgG expression in cattle where the endogenous bovine immunoglobulin genes were knocked out. In this report, hIgG1 class switch regulatory elements were subjected to site-specific genomic chimerization on HAC vectors to further enhance hIgG expression and improve hIgG subclass distribution in cattle. These species-specific modifications in a chromosome scale resulted in much higher production levels of fully hIgG of up to 15 g/L in sera or plasma, the highest ever reported for a transgenic animal system. Transchromosomic (Tc) cattle containing engineered HAC vectors generated hpAbs with high titers against human-origin antigens following immunization. This study clearly demonstrates that species-specific sequence differences in pre-BCR/BCR components and IgG1 class switch regulatory elements between human and bovine are indeed functionally distinct across the two species, and therefore, are responsible for low production of fully hIgG in our early versions of Tc cattle. The high production levels of fully hIgG with hIgG1 subclass dominancy in a large farm animal species achieved here is an important milestone towards broad therapeutic applications of hpAbs.",

                "Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) have been used as a therapeutic agent for many years in treating a variety of diseases, particularly for infectious diseases. However, current IgG products, such as human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), monoclonal antibodies, and animal derived polyclonal antibodies, have known limitations. The limitation of human polyclonal antibody products has been the requirement to obtain high volumes of plasma from convalescent human donors with high titers to make commercial products. Although animal-derived pAbs could be an alternative to human polyclonal antibody products, they typically have relatively high toxicity since these animal-derived antibody products are highly immunogenic that can cause a variety of severe adverse effects such as allergic reactions. To avoid serious side effects, animal antibodies are usually processed into smaller F(ab) or F(ab\u2019)2 fragments which significantly reduces their half-life and potency, and typically restricts their availability to a limited number of administrations. Disadvantage for monoclonal antibodies is that they are directed against a single epitope that may be subject to rapid mutational escape and the cost of manufacturing mAb products are very high.",
                "Human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs) produced from transgenic animals could be an important alternative to human plasma-derived IVIG therapy [1\u20135] with potentially a wider range of applications. However, availability of such transgenic animal species was limited to mice [6] and rabbits, thus, due to their small body size, they were obviously unsuitable for large-scale production of hpAbs. We previously developed a Tc bovine system to produce fully hIgG in plasma and reported the generation of one Tc bovine (calf 468) with a human artificial chromosome (\u03baHAC) vector containing the entire human immunoglobulin heavy (hIGH) and \u03ba light chain (hIGK) loci, and two bovine IGH (bIGH) loci, bIGHM and bIGHML1, being disrupted, designated as \u03baHAC/IGHM \u2212/\u2212 IGHML1 \u2212/\u2212 [4]. However, the amount of \u201cfully\u201d hIgG (hIgG/hIg\u03ba) was only ~0.3 g/L on average due to the fact that majority of IgG expressed by \u03baHAC/IGHM \u2212/\u2212 IGHML1 \u2212/\u2212 Tc bovine is chimeric IgG (cIgG, containing human heavy chain and bovine light chain). Apparently, this very low level of fully hIgG is not good enough for a practical use of hpAbs for human therapeutic purpose.",
                "As an effort to overcome these problems, in our recent report [7] we constructed a new HAC vector, cKSL-HAC\u0394, and transferred this HAC to new double knockout (DKO) IGHM \u2212/\u2212 IGHML1 \u2212/\u2212 cell lines, which were established through breeding. The resulting cKSL-HAC\u0394 Tc cattle increased total human IgG levels (including fully human IgG and cIgG) drastically, but fully human IgG level was still low, due to the presence of intact bovine light chain gene in this series of Tc calves [7]. In order to address the low fully human IgG issue, we carried out bovine lambda light chain knock out [8], because lambda light chain is the dominant (~95%) light chain in bovine. Using the established triple knockout (TKO) cell line, we generated cKSL-HAC\u0394/TKO cattle which showed a significant improvement in fully human IgG level in sera or plasma [8].",
                "Despite the significant improvement enhanced by HAC modifications and bovine lambda light chain knock out, we still observed a phenomenon which could be related to potential problems in class-switch recombination in our Tc cattle: high human IgG2/IgG1 subclass ratio and high expression level of trans-class switched bovine IgG (t-bIgG). Regarding human IgG subclass, for the production of therapeutic hpAbs, human IgG1 would be preferred to other IgG subclass in most cases due to longer half-life, higher affinity to Fc receptor (thus greater effector functions associated with IgG1 Fc such as ADCC and CDC) and strong complement fixation, and the majority of therapeutic mAbs in the market is IgG1 [9]. Therefore, for these practical reasons, Tc bovines producing high levels of fully human IgG with IgG1 dominancy would be ideal for many therapeutic applications, particularly in the fields of infectious diseases and cancer. However, Tc cattle we reported previously [8] showed human IgG2 dominancy. In addition, high levels of t-bIgG in our early versions of Tc cattle were also observed [4].",
                "Since immunoglobulin gene organization and function evolved distinctly among species [10], there could be highly species-specific genomic sequences in immunoglobulin-related genes. However, little is known to what extent these species-specific sequence differences are influential to immunoglobulin function across species. Here, we hypothesize that there could be interspecies-incompatible genomic sequences between human and bovine that could functionally hamper high production of fully hIgG in the bovine environment, and we therefore performed species-specific chromosome engineering on our HAC vectors and evaluated each of these new vectors in cattle to test our hypothesis which is based on the concept of \u201cspecies incompatibility\u201d. Specifically, we successfully constructed a series of new HAC vectors in which the hIGHG1 gene class switch regulatory element, human I\u03b31-S\u03b31 (hI\u03b31-hS\u03b31) were bovinized (human sequences were replaced with bovine sequences). For one HAC vector, the hIGHG1 gene transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were also bovinized. The results from a series of Tc bovine demonstrated that these species-specific modifications at chromosome levels drastically increased fully hIgG production levels, decreased t-bIgG expression, and also improved hIgG subclass distribution, strongly suggesting that these particular species-specific sequence differences between human and bovine are functionally distinct across the species and are the major cause for low production of fully hIgG and abnormal IgG subclass distribution in our previous genotypes of Tc cattle."

                        "In a series of our study, we hypothesized that there could be some interspecies-incompatibilities between human and bovine that may generally hamper high production of fully hIgG in the bovine environment. In a previous report, we firstly addressed the IgM-based pre-BCR/BCR function issue by a strategy aiming at resolving species incompatibilities between bovine Ig-\u03b1/Ig-\u03b2 and human IgM heavy chain, and between bovine surrogate light chain (SLC) and human IgM heavy chain [7]. In that strategy, we replaced part of human IgM heavy chain constant region (CH2 to TM2) with the corresponding sequences of bovine IgM, and also we included human SLC loci along with human lambda light chain locus in the HAC vector, resulting in a cKSL-HAC\u0394 [7]. In the current study, the same strategy was employed to \u03baHAC [4] to construct KcHAC\u0394 vector without implementing human SLC.",
                        "To construct KcHAC\u0394 vector, part of the hIGHM constant region gene (CH1 through TM2 domains) was bovinized so that in such a chimeric IgM structure [which was named as cIgM(CH1) for chimeric human IgM bovinized at CH1 through TM2 domain], the pre-BCR/BCR could interact more effectively with bovine surrogate light chain, orthodox light chain and Ig-\u03b1/Ig-\u03b2 molecules for better pre-BCR/BCR signaling (Fig 1). On the other hand, in the previously reported cKSL-HAC\u0394 vector [7], part of the hIGHM constant region gene (CH2 through TM2 domains) was differently bovinized and, furthermore, the human surrogate light chain hVPREB1 and hIGLL1 (\u03bb5 in the mouse) genes were introduced with the hChr22 fragment so that in such a chimeric IgM structure, which was named as cIgM(CH2) for chimeric human IgM bovinized at CH2 through TM2 domain, pre-BCR/BCR could pair with human SLC and could also interact with bovine Ig-\u03b1/Ig-\u03b2 molecules for better pre-BCR/BCR signaling (Fig 1). Due to the species-specific distinct chimeric sequences of hIgM, cIgM(CH1) and cIgM(CH2) proteins, pre-BCR/BCR function/signaling in each HAC vector (i.e. \u03baHAC, KcHAC\u0394, cKSL-HAC\u0394, respectively, in Fig 1) could affect B cell developmental fate, and eventually hIgG production profile, differently. Likewise, we also constructed the KcHAC vector where the hChr2 fragment (\u03baTL1) [7] was translocated to the SC20 fragment bearing the bovinized IgM, cIgM(CH1), sequence."

                        "The KcHAC\u0394 vector was constructed in DT40 hybrid cells as outlined in Fig 2A and 2B, using the chromosome cloning system. Human chromosome 2 derived DT40 clone \u03baTL1 [7] was transfected with targeting vector pTELCAGzeoCD8A to replace puromycin resistance gene with zeocin resistant gene. One hundred of zeocin resistant colonies were examined for puromycin sensitivity and 31 puromycin sensitive colonies were screened by PCR with primers Puro-FR for the detection of remained puromycin cassette and CD8AKO-FR, F2R2 for the detection of homologous recombination. Seven puro-FR negative and CD8AKO-FR, F2R2 positive clones were further screened by PCR with primers FABP1-FR, EIF2AK3-FR, RPIA-FR, IGKC-FR, IGKV-FR and cos138KO-FR. Five clones were further examined by FISH and kZ7 and kZ20 were selected for further steps. Human chromosome 14 derived HAC basal vector \u201c14D\u201d DT40 clone [7] 14D1 was transfected with a targeting vector pCH1CAGzeo(R)DT(F) for bovinization of part of human IgM constant region (Fig 2C). Twenty-six zeocin resistant colonies were screened with PCR cHAC-FR for homologous recombinant and PCR CH3F3xCH4R2 for non-targeted cells. 10 positive clones were subjected to extensive PCR screening with 11 sets of primers (S1A Fig). Selected 4 clones were examined by FISH (S1B Fig). Positive clones CH1D2 and CH1D10 were fused with chromosome 2 containing DT40 clones kZ7 and kZ20 (whole cell fusion). Twelve hygromycin and blasticidin resistant colonies were subjected to PCR screening with IGKV-FR for chromosome 2/IGK locus and g1(g2)-FR for chromosome 14/IGH locus. All 12 clones were positive for both PCR and further screened with additional 6 PCR for the presence of kZ and additional 12 PCR for the presence of CH1D (Fig 3A and S2A Fig). Correct hybrid clone KCD1 and KCD34 were further confirmed by FISH and selected for further steps (S2B Fig). In order to translocate IGK locus containing chromosome 2 fragment onto cIgM(CH1) modified 14D vector (CH1D) at RNR2 locus, Cre expression vector was transfected to the above KCD1 and KCD34 clones to initiate Cre-loxP recombination between loxP at cos138 locus on kZ (truncated human chromosome 2) and loxP at RNR2 locus on CH1D (Fig 2B). Recombinants were enriched by sorting GFP positive cells as GFP expression is conferred by reconstitution of the PGK promoter-loxP-GFP cassette at the translocation site. Sorting was conducted three times which resulted in two distinct GFP positive populations with different expression levels (Fig 3B). The lower GFP population contained the successfully translocated to generate KcHAC\u0394 vector, which was determined by PCR primers; PGK2 x GFP2 confirmed the junction between chromosome 14 fragment and chromosome 2 fragment generated by chromosome translocation, and PCR primers, CreCAGzeo-F3R3, confirmed the successful removal of CAG promoter-zeo cassette in the cIgM(CH1) site (Fig 3B, S3A Fig). The higher GFP population contained the inverted CH1D fragment between the loxP at the RNR2 locus and the lox511 at the locus AL512355/AL391156 by a Cre-mediated recombination which was confirmed by PCR primers, CAGpuro-F3 x GFP2 and STOPpuro-F2 x STOPpuro-R, followed by direct sequencing (Fig 3B). KCDH1(3L) and KCDH34(3L) was finally identified as DT40 hybrid cell lines retaining the KcHAC\u0394 based on the result of extensive genomic PCR (Fig 3A, S3B Fig) and two color-FISH (Fig 2B). The KcHAC vector was similarly constructed in DT40 cells. The hChr2 fragment (\u03baTL1) was translocated to the SC20 fragment [11] bearing the bovinized cIgM(CH1)."

                        "Our second strategy was to address whether IgG class switch regulatory element is also involved in species-specific regulation. Class switch recombination that determines IgH isotype is preceded by transcription from each IGH locus-associated switch region (SH), called germline transcript [12]. Each IGH constant region (CH) gene is linked with its own SH region which is also associated with its own IH exons. The germline transcript, IH-SH-CH (eventually spliced to mature IH-CH), is driven by the promoter/enhancer elements located just 5\u2019 of the IH exons and those elements are cytokine or other activator-responsive. In a simple model of class switch, the specific activators and/or cytokines induce the germline transcript from its activator/cytokine-responsive IH promoter/enhancer. The 3\u2019E\u03b1 element further enhances the transcription of the IH-SH-CH sequence. This transcription causes the switch region to be relaxed so that it can be targeted by the enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which causes fusion with another SH region, leading to class switch. Our hypothesis was that, for example, the hI\u03b31-hS\u03b31 regulatory element linked with the hIGHG1 gene is somehow incompatible with such bovine activators/cytokines-induced DNA-binding proteins to efficiently induce class switch to hIgG1, due to the species-specific sequence differences (S4A and S4B Fig). This may be why many early versions of Tc bovines showed hIgG2-dominancy instead of hIgG1 that is a major subclass in humans.",
                        "Based on the above hypothesis, we bovinized the hI\u03b31-hS\u03b31 class switch regulatory element with that of the bIGHG1 gene to construct the isHAC vector containing the bI\u03b31-bS\u03b31 sequence upstream of the hC\u03b31 region on the cKSL-HAC\u0394 vector (Fig 4). Moreover, the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains of the hIGHG1 gene on the isHAC vector were further bovinized with sequences of the bIGHG1 gene transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain to generate the istHAC (Fig 5), considering the species-specific sequence differences (S4B Fig). Since the cKSL-HAC\u0394 and KcHAC\u0394 vectors might potentially have functional differences, as seen in the DKO background, and it was uncertain how differently these two HAC vectors would behave in the TKO background lacking the bIGL expression, we decided to also bovinize the KcHAC\u0394 vector to generate the isKcHAC\u0394 vector containing the bI\u03b31-bS\u03b31 sequence upstream of the hC\u03b31 region on the KcHAC\u0394 (Fig 4)."

On the contrary, percentages of bIgM-single positive and bIgM/CD21-double positive B cells appear to be similar to those of the DKO background (Fig 9) in the KcHAC\u0394 series (i.e. isKcHAC\u0394 and KcHAC\u0394), with percentages of bIgM/hIg\u03ba -double positive B cells remarkably increased.",
                        "Since our rationale for the isHAC, istHAC and isKcHAC\u0394 vector construction was to directly determine how much the bovinization of the hIGHG1 gene class switch regulatory element and transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains impacts on fully hIgG production profile under the bovine physiological condition, we measured serum concentrations of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba and hIgG subclass distribution at about 6 months of age in a series of HAC/TKO cattle (Fig 11A\u201311D). Overall, in all five HAC/TKO genotypes, both serum concentrations and percentages of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba substantially increased when compared with those of the HAC/DKO cattle, so the bIGL cluster deletion proved to be very effective for high production of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba in Tc cattle. Fully hIgG/hIg\u03bb in the cKSL-HAC\u0394 series (i.e. isHAC, istHAC and cKSL-HAC\u0394) was ~5% of hIgG/hIg\u03ba (data not shown) and the rest was chimeric hIgG/bIg\u03ba (S6 Fig). When compared with their original cKSL-HAC\u0394/TKO animals, fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba production increased most significantly in istHAC/TKO cattle (p = 0.023, Fig 11B, S2 Table) while the isHAC/TKO did considerably, but not significantly. Of particular note, hIgG1 became a dominant subclass in both isHAC/TKO and istHAC/TKO cattle, whereas the original cKSL-HAC\u0394/TKO cattle are significantly turned hIgG2-dominant from hIgG1-dominancy in the cKSL-HAC\u0394/DKO ones (Fig 11D). Interestingly, this trend of observation was consistently seen also in comparison between the isKcHAC\u0394/TKO, KcHAC\u0394/TKO and KcHAC/DKO cattle, where fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba production significantly increased (p <0.001 to the KcHAC\u0394/TKO and KcHAC/DKO cattle) (Fig 11B, S2 Table) with the significant switch to hIgG1-dominancy in the isKcHAC\u0394/TKO cattle from hIgG2-dominancy in the original KcHAC\u0394/TKO and KcHAC/DKO cattle (Fig 11A\u201311D).",
                        "These data demonstrated that the I\u03b31-S\u03b31 class switch regulatory element is controlled in a species-specific manner. The species-specific effect on fully hIgG serum concentration seems to be different between the differently bovinized cIgM proteins [cIgM(CH1) vs cIgM(CH2)]; the bovinization of the I\u03b31-S\u03b31 element in the cIgM(CH1) background significantly improved it (i.e. isKcHAC\u0394 vs KcHAC\u0394) while it did not in the cIgM(CH2) background (i.e. isHAC vs cKSL-HAC\u0394). In the cIgM(CH2) background, the bovinization of IgG1 transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains was additionally necessary to significantly improve fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba production (i.e. istHAC vs cKSL-HAC\u0394). Both in the cIgM(CH1) and cIgM(CH2) backgrounds, the bovinized I\u03b31-S\u03b31 sequence drastically altered hIgG1 subclass-dominancy.",
                        "Furthermore, bovinization of the I\u03b31-S\u03b31 class switch regulatory element resulted in drastic decrease in t-bIgG generation. T-bIgG can be generated by trans-chromosomal class switch recombination (Fig 12). This mechanism is supported by the sequence data of cloned genomic PCR products using forward primer located at 5\u2019 of human S\u03bc region and the reverse primer located at 3\u2019 of bovine S\u03b31 region. The sequence data showed human S\u03bc connected to bovine S\u03b31 (S7 Fig). Also cloned RT-PCR product using mixed human V gene sequence forward primers with bovine C\u03b31 reverse primer showed functional transcript with human variable region with bovine C\u03b31 sequence (S8 Fig). In order to evaluate the effect of bovinization of I\u03b31-S\u03b31 class switch regulatory element, we measured t-bIgG serum concentration in KcHAC\u0394, cKSL-HAC\u0394, isHAC, istHAC and isKcHAC\u0394 with TKO background at 5\u20136 months old and 11\u201312 months old and calculated ratio of t-bIgG concentration to total IgG (total human IgG plus t-bIgG) concentration (Fig 13). Tc cattle without bovinization of I\u03b31-S\u03b31 class switch regulatory element (KcHAC\u0394, cKSL-HAC\u0394) showed high ratio of t-bIgG and high t-bIgG level in their serum, whereas Tc cattle with bovinization of I\u03b31-S\u03b31 class switch regulatory element (isHAC, istHAC and isKcHAC\u0394) showed clear reduction of t-bIgG (Fig 13A and 13B). These results indicate that species incompatibility in class switch regulatory element could be the cause of abnormal class switch recombination and bovinization of class switch regulatory element restored more efficient normal class switch recombination to human IgG1.",
                        "In order to elucidate if the HAC/TKO cattle that underwent such complex chromosome engineering (S9 Fig) could functionally generate fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba pAbs in response to antigen immunization, we immunized several HAC/TKO cattle with human oral squamous cell carcinoma. All the HAC/TKO cattle immunized mounted robust anti-human carcinoma fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba response (Fig 14). The data indicates that the HAC/TKO genotype is generally useful for high production of antigen-specific fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba pAbs, which seemed to be further enhanced by the bovinized HAC vectors, istHAC and isKcHAC\u0394."

                "This study demonstrates a feasibility of producing high levels of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba (>5 g/L on average/median in novel genotypes, i.e. isHAC/TKO, istHAC/TKO and isKcHAC\u0394/TKO) in sera/plasma of a large farm animal species. This serum concentration of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba is, to our knowledge, the highest ever reported in in transgenic animals. For example, transgenic mice can only produce about 0.5g/L of serum fully hIgG [3, 11, 13]. The fully hIgG level is also the closest to or greater than that in healthy humans [14]. Moreover, hIgG subclass produced in isHAC/TKO, istHAC/TKO and isKcHAC\u0394/TKO cattle is hIgG1-dominant, which is the major subclass in healthy humans and is also widely used in therapeutic hIgG recombinant antibodies in development and on the market. Importantly, all the HAC/TKO cattle tested can functionally generate fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba pAbs against human-origin antigens, which would be difficult to achieve by conventional human plasma-derived IVIG, due to immune tolerance in humans [15]. In order to reach this high production of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba pAbs in a large farm animal species, we exploited a unique approach, species-specific chromosome engineering, to address the interspecies-incompatibilities between human and bovine in IgG production machinery at multiple levels.",
                "In our previous study [7], we investigated interspecies-incompatibilities at the level of protein-protein interaction (e.g. pre-BCR/BCR function); and in the current study, we explored this issue at the level of DNA-protein interaction (e.g. IgG1 class switch regulation) inTc bovine B cells (Fig 15). The interspecies-incompatibility at the level of protein-protein interaction was addressed by constructing the KcHAC\u0394 (KcHAC) and cKSL-HAC\u0394 vectors by bovinizing part of hIgM constant region without or with human SLC introduction, cIgM(CH1) or cIgM(CH2), respectively. Interestingly, the expression of these two distinct cIgM proteins on bovine B cells altered IgM B cell development considerably and the subsequent hIgG production profile significantly, as compared with the original \u03baHAC vector [4]. While both vectors seemed to commonly increase the percentage of IgM/CD21-double positive B cells presumably by the better interaction with bovine Ig-\u03b1/\u03b2 molecules in the DKO background, they behaved differently in the DKO vs TKO conditions; cIgM(CH1), such as KcHAC\u0394 and isKcHAC\u0394, produces higher hIgM/hK than hIgM/bK in TKO background, whereas cIgM(CH2), such as cKSL-HAC\u0394, isHAC and istHAC, produces hIgM/hK and hIgM/bK at similar levels. These results correlated well with the ratio of fully human IgG to total human IgG in serum. The same trend about the lower fully human IgG ratio to the total human IgG in cIgM(CH2) Tc bovines than cIgM(CH1) Tc bovines can be observed in DKO background, too. Even though cIgM(CH2) with SLC increased total human IgG level significantly, Tc bovines with these modifications showed lower fully human IgG ratio to total human IgG than that from Tc bovines with cIgM(CH1) or wildtype IgM(based on the comparison to kHAC or KcHAC). On the other hand, cIgM(CH1) modification had little effect on fully human IgG ratio to total human IgG (based on the comparison between kHAC and KcHAC) and human SLC also had little impact on fully human IgG ratio to total human IgG (unpublished data).",
                "In the DKO background, KcHAC [cIgM(CH1)] vector showed more obvious IgM/bIg\u03bb, IgM/bIg\u03ba and IgM/hIg\u03ba-double positive B cells whereas either \u03baHAC or cKSL-HAC\u0394 [cIgM(CH2)] did not, indicating that the bovinized CH1 domain of the cIgM(CH1) from KcHAC vector might be critical to properly pair with bIg\u03bb/bIg\u03ba, presumably also with bovine SLC, especially through the bC\u03bb/bC\u03ba constant region and bovine \u03bb5 of SLC. On the contrary, bC\u03bb (or bC\u03ba/bovine \u03bb5) may not properly pair with the hCH1 domain due to the species-specific sequence difference. Another striking difference between the two cIgM proteins is hIgG1 subclass dominancy. The cIgM(CH1) revealed hIgG2-dominancy both in the DKO and TKO backgrounds whereas the cIgM(CH2) showed significantly distinct hIgG1-dominancy influenced by the presence of bIg\u03bb expression (hIgG1-dominant in DKO vs hIgG2-dominant in TKO).",
                "Taken together, these data suggest that such different features in IgM B cell development and hIgG production profile could be partly attributed to the distinct pre-BCR signaling; the cIgM(CH1) might more effectively pair with bovine SLC as it pairs better with bIg\u03bb, whereas the cIgM(CH2) might preferentially pair with human surrogate light chain introduced by the hChr22 fragment as it did not properly pair with bIg\u03bb (presumably not also with bovine surrogate light chain, either). This kind of different formats of IgM pre-BCR, pairing either with bovine or human SLC, might affect the following IgM BCR function, particularly BCR signal strength (this could be further influenced by pairing with bIg\u03bb vs hIg\u03ba), determining subsequent B cell fate, such as B1/marginal zone (MZ) B cell-like (T-independent responder) vs B2/follicular B cell-like (T-dependent responder), which is reported to eventually influence IgG subclass preference [16\u201321]; hIgG2 for T-independent vs hIgG1 for T-dependent response, respectively, in human [20, 21]. This is our first evidence on the interspecies-incompatibility in IgM pre-BCR/BCR function that eventually affects fully hIgG production profile.",
                "The second evidence on the interspecies-incompatibility was revealed in IgG1 class switch regulation and production by bovinization of the hIGHG1 gene class switch regulatory element, hI\u03b31-hS\u03b31, with or without the hIGHG1 gene transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains also being bovinized. Notably, the isHAC/TKO, istHAC/TKO and isKcHAC\u0394/TKO cattle significantly altered hIgG1 production profile in comparison with their original cKSL-HAC\u0394/TKO and KcHAC\u0394/TKO cattle which were both hIgG2-dominant. Some considerable differences observed between the isHAC/TKO and istHAC/TKO cattle may suggest another interspecies-incompatibility in IgG1 transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains function such that the bovinized IgG1 transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains could be more compatible with bovine signal transduction molecules for the higher productivity of fully hIgG/hIg\u03ba with hIgG1 subclass being dominant in the bovine condition. This is consistent with a report that IgG1 transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains function is critical for IgG1 immunoglobulin secretion [22].",
                "The effect of the bovinized I\u03b31-S\u03b31 sequence is of a particular interest. It is reported that virtually all transcription factor-binding locations, landmarks of transcription initiation, and the resulting gene expression observed from the hChr21 in the human hepatocytes were recapitulated across the entire hChr21 in the mouse hepatocyte nucleus [23]. This implies that the human-specific gene expression profile could be simply provided by the human DNA primary sequence even under the non-human species environment. If we apply this view to our Tc bovine situation, the non-bovinized HAC (i.e., human DNA primary sequence) would have been mostly sufficient for providing the human-like hIgG expression profile, such as hIgG1-dominancy, in the bovine condition. However, this was not the case. Thus, our finding that bovinization of the hI\u03b31-hS\u03b31 sequence sufficiently caused the significant switch from high t-bIgG to very low t-bIgG and also from hIgG2-dominancy to hIgG1-dominancy in the Tc bovine condition strongly suggests the interspecies-incompatibility in IgG1 class switch regulation between the two species.",
                "In summary, \u201cfunctional chromosomics\u201d using HAC vectors identified species-specific genomic elements (i.e. pre-BCR/BCR components and IgG1 class switch regulatory element, I\u03b31-S\u03b31) that greatly improve fully hIgG production profile at multiple levels in Tc cattle. These interspecies-sequence differences are responsible for low production of fully hIgG in our early versions of Tc cattle. The species-specific modifications thereof resulted in much higher production of fully hIgG, which is practically an important milestone towards human therapeutic applications beyond current human plasma-derived IVIG therapies. What is also important is to note that this complex chromosome engineering was done in somatic fibroblast cells, which are available in virtually any species, to alleviate a necessity of using ES cells. Therefore, this approach may be broadly applicable for more complicated and dynamic functional genomics at a chromosome level [24] in non-murine mammalian species for basic science and biomedical/agricultural applications.",
                "This project was initiated more than 10 years ago with the concept of developing a platform technology to produce a wide range of human antibody products at scale using large farm animals such as cattle. The current report clearly proved that there is a great potential to use Tc bovine system for the clinical applications in the future."
