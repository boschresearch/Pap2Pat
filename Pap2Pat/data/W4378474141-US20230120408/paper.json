    "abstract": "Progress in superconducting device and detector technologies over the past decade have realized practical applications in quantum computers, detectors for far-IR telescopes, and optical communications. Superconducting thin film materials, however, have remained largely unchanged, with aluminum still being the material of choice for superconducting qubits, and Nb compounds for higher frequency devices. $mathrm{MgB}_2$, known for its highest $mathrm{T}_c$ (39 K) among metallic superconductors, is a viable material for higher frequency superconducting devices moving towards THz frequencies. However, difficulty in synthesizing thin films have prevented implementation of $mathrm{MgB}_2$ devices into the application base of superconducting electronics, despite promising preliminary results for a number of applications. We have developed smooth and uniform $mathrm{MgB}_2$ films on 4-inch Si wafers by depositing uniform Mg-B co-sputtered film, capping the film in situ to create a closed environment, followed by an optimized post-annealing step. We further report mature device fabrication processes and demonstrate test structures to measure properties of the films. This includes resonators with internal Q factor over $mathrm{10}^4$ at 4.5 K and tunable high kinetic inductance (5-50 pH/$square$ readily achieved in a 40 nm film), opening up the path for development of high frequency and high temperature $mathrm{MgB}_2$ microdevices.",

                "The overall flow of our MgB2 thin film fabrication process utilizing magnetron sputtering is illustrated in Figure 1a, and the resulting superconducting MgB2 thin films on silicon and sapphire wafers are shown in Figure 1b andc, respectively. Magnetron sputtering is widely available, easily scalable, and produces uniform films, but in-situ sputtered MgB2 films resulted in low Tc 22,32 from oxidation, small grain size, and/or off-stoichiometry due to high vapor pressure and low sticking coefficient of magnesium at elevated temperatures (> 200 \u00b0C), as well as contamination. Post-annealing of these films shows improvements in Tc but at the cost of roughness (> 10 nm rms). Room temperature deposition results in uniform distribution of magnesium but requires a post-annealing process. Annealing magnesium-boron composite film in vacuum resulted in evaporation of magnesium, rough surface, and transition temperature around 6 K. Magnesium evaporation is prevented by capping the composite film with a thin (tens of nm) layer of high melting temperature material such as tantalum or boron. Tantalum does not react with magnesium or boron at typical annealing temperatures below 800 \u00b0C, but cracks above 700 \u00b0C and needs to be removed for easily measuring superconducting properties. Boron, a dielectric material with a high melting point of 2076 \u00b0C, serves as a better capping layer. Surface boron oxide has a low melting point of 450 \u00b0C and provides a crack-free, viscous capping layer. 33 There are two potential byproducts between MgB2 and boron: MgB4 and MgB7. Both have slightly higher formation energies compared to MgB2, 34 so their formation would be minimal, and would not affect the measurement of superconducting properties even if a thin layer of the byproducts is formed, because they are dielectric materials unlike metallic MgB2. We have developed and demonstrated fabrication maturity in removing these capping layers for device development and optimization. In our work we tried many deposition conditions and, mostly through optimizing the roughness of the film, we chose a co-deposited Mg-B precursor film at room temperature. Sputtering of boron is very challenging, and the high melting point leads to a very low deposition rate. Given the propensity for oxidation, we optimized the boron sputtering for maximum rate, then tuned the magnesium sputtering conditions and annealing process to achieve optimized films. In order to achieve smooth films, the asdeposited, pre-annealed Mg-B composite film must be as smooth as possible. A small amount of RF substrate bias (15 W) during deposition reduced the surface roughness from 1.74 nm to 0.34~0.45 nm (rms). Increasing the bias beyond this point gave denser boron films, but etched the Mg or heated the surface too much to achieve controllable stoichiometry in a co-sputtered film. We saw indications that even this low substrate bias was enough energy to induce some reaction between Mg and B as we started to see transitions in as-sputtered films before any postannealing step, though the Tc,0 was below liquid helium temperatures. A rapid thermal processor (RTP) provides good thermal uniformity across large wafers and was used for postannealing. Because magnesium evaporation jumps up around its melting point of 650 \u00b0C, it is critical to keep the annealing temperature below this to avoid any potential surface roughening caused by evaporated magnesium that has yet to react with boron. By optimizing the annealing condition, we measured Tc,0 of 32 K (Figure 2a,b) for devices from MgB2 thin films with 0.476 nm rms roughness (Figure 3a), and circular area of 100 mm diameter. We further achieved Tc,0 of 37.2 K, shown in Figure 2c andd, highest ever reported for sputtered film, by inducing large grains (thus sacrificing surface roughness) from post annealing interchanging magnesium and boron layers of stoichiometric ratio (2 boron to 1 magnesium atomic ratio), similar to previous attempts, [35][36][37][38][39] but with an additional boron capping layer on top. The massive migration of magnesium into the interfacing boron layers led to large MgB2 grains and high Tc, but at the same time resulted in large voids and rough surfaces. Certain applications may take advantage of these films, particularly when devices have a very small active area. Sapphire substrates have often been used for growing MgB2 films because both have hexagonal crystal structure and lattice mismatch is less than 0.1 % with 30\u00b0 rotation. 40 However, oxygen readily diffuses from sapphire to MgB2 because magnesium has lower oxidation enthalpy compared to aluminum 41 and forms an interdiffusion layer. 17 This is especially detrimental for thin films under 100 nm. An alternative substrate is hexagonal SiC, especially for in-situ growth of MgB2, because of the close lattice match. In fact, the highest Tc ever measured for MgB2 is from highly textured MgB2 thin film slightly strained by SiC. 23 However, SiC is more expensive than Si, and polycrystalline MgB2 films from post-annealing process would not be able to take advantage of the lattice match. Because magnesium reacts with silicon to form Mg2Si, a thin inert buffer layer was used to prevent direct contact between MgB2 and Si. As was demonstrated previously, 31 silicon nitride proved to be unreactive against magnesium, and LPCVD nitride as thin as 30 nm has been successfully tested to be sufficiently thick enough to serve as a good buffer, as shown in the STEM image in Figure 3b. In theory, the thickness is only limited to the threshold where no pinholes are left exposing Si, mostly dominated by the initial substrate roughness. The PECVD nitride deposition on Si wafers is a highly commercialized process, 42 not requiring the development of an independent recipe specific to MgB2 thin films. Early in our work, we found that identical deposition and annealing recipes resulted in higher critical temperature on a silicon nitride buffer than on sapphire. Later it was confirmed through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that magnesium from MgB2 layer migrated to sapphire substrate and resulted in large deviation in stoichiometry of the film near film/substrate interface (Figure 3c).  For device design and fabrication, controlling resistivity and related materials properties such as kinetic inductance brings a huge advantage. Typically, such control is accomplished by deliberately adding impurities 43 or changing stoichiometry. 44 However, in materials deposited through reactive sputtering, such as NbN or TiN, the gas nonuniformity and hysteretic parameter curve make tuning unrealistic. The high Tc MgB2 thin films therefore have a tremendous advantage when it comes to the range of resistivity/kinetic inductance control. 30 Resistivity control in MgB2 can be done by controlling the magnesium to boron ratios. Adding more boron or reducing the amount of magnesium by reducing the RF power on magnesium target, increases the resistivity of as-deposited/preannealed Mg-B composite films gradually, as shown in Figure 5. Annealing the films causes magnesium particles to react with boron and form MgB2, resulting in a linear correlation between the resistivity of percolating magnesium (as-deposited) and percolating MgB2 (postannealed).

                        "Here we present and discuss results describing the internal quality factor and kinetic inductance of planar quarter-wave resonators patterned into our MgB2 thin films using a coplanar waveguide (CPW) architecture. The overall flow of the device fabrication process is illustrated in Figure 6, fabricated wafer-scale devices are shown in Figure 7, and measurements and analysis of the devices in Figure 8. We demonstrate fabrication maturity on par with more commonly used materials (e.g. NbTiN) 45 and show figures of merit for microwave applications at higher temperatures. Given that the BCS surface resistance is both frequency and temperature dependent, better performance at lower frequencies and higher temperatures is a strong case for better performance for higher frequency at lower temperatures. Work is ongoing to improve on dielectric losses in the film stack, as well as demonstrate high frequency losses in the material and will be published following those results. The losses in a superconducting resonator can be measured through the quality factor of the resonator. By fitting the resonator to a well-known model, 46 we can obtain the internal microwave losses in the resonator. These losses include superconducting losses (from the BCS surface resistance), dielectric losses (both in the substrate/passivation layers, as well as the interfaces), and radiative losses. While our initial goal of this experiment was to try to measure the BCS surface resistance in the films, through troubleshooting and optimizing the losses, we have concluded that we are still dominated by dielectric losses in our thin film stack. By adopting standard fabrication techniques like a buffered oxide etch, we continue to see decreases in these losses, with the Qi ~ 10 4 at 4.5 K (Figure 8d). We assume that the losses are limited by dielectrics or interfaces for two reasons. First, as we cool to lower temperature, the value of Qi has no temperature dependence from 1.5 K down to 1 K, with the value about 4\u00d710 4 . Work is ongoing to measure these films below 1 K, which will help separate dielectric losses (specifically TLS) from quasi-particle losses. Another strong indicator that the losses in our devices are indeed limited by dielectrics (or interfaces) is that the quality factor is highly dependent on the width of the devices. Smaller devices have higher dielectric fill factors and so the dielectric loss contribution goes up. The inset of Figure 8d shows the quality factor of 5 resonators (widths are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 um) of the same length (5 mm) scaling from ~7500 to 10,000. In the case that these losses are in the superconductor, there would be an f 2 dependence and given that the widest traces yield the highest frequency resonators, they would have the lowest quality factors.  Because MgB2 doesn't have a typical temperature dependence, using the Mattis-Bardeen theory to estimate \u03b1 is not feasible, but the method used is very accurate for the case of \u03b1 > 0.5. In the same device used to describe the losses, alpha goes from 0.84 at 10 \u03bcm linewidth to 0.95 at 3 \u03bcm linewidth, with a consistent Lk = 22~24 pH/\u25a1. This is shown in Figure 8b where two chips from different wafers are shown. In the second device, the same film recipe is used, but the films are slightly thinner and so Lk = 28 pH/\u25a1. The latter shows even higher kinetic inductance can be readily achieved. By tuning the Mg content in the precursor film, we can achieve a range of 5-50 pH/\u25a1 for a similar film thickness (around 40 nm), since kinetic inductance is directly proportional to sheet resistance. 48 Using thinner films, we should be able to achieve very large numbers approaching or exceeding nH/\u25a1 values. A systematic study of RF properties as a function of Mg content is ongoing. In these films, tuning the stoichiometry is much more feasible than reactive gas sputtering, since we do not need to control gas partial pressures in a vacuum environment, which is a challenge in depositing Nb and Ti nitride films. We are also able to thin down the films using an argon ion mill or bromine plasma, 49 without degradation of the superconducting properties (within some limits). This has already been reported for producing even ultra-thin films of the same material. 50 Annealing a thicker film also avoids surface tension requiring more energy to achieve the same grain size and hence achieving the same critical temperature at lower temperatures.",
                        "We have used a fairly simple model that assumes a linear combination of the penetration depths associated with the two gaps in the material 29 to fit the temperature dependent frequency shift of two different resonators. The high coupling quality factor (~10 4 ) made it difficult to find the resonance above 10-15 K and so the data does not go beyond this temperature, however, the fits shown in Figure 8c show that the contribution from the larger gap is small (~12%), but non-negligible. This makes sense given that the smaller gap is responsible for the bulk of the kinetic inductance, which is high in our films. Using our thin film capability and expanding the two-gap model to include an interaction parameter which could also have temperature dependence, we hope to contribute to a global model for the contribution of the second gap to the overall film properties. Until now, film properties could not be reproduced under different conditions to modify the MB model for the two-gap material. Furthermore, there is only a rudimentary understanding on how these two gaps will affect high frequency performance in the films, and how pairbreaking of the smaller gap will contribute to RF losses while there still exists a larger gap. This is perhaps the most important future study planned for these films. Fractional frequency shift as a function of temperature for two different resonator chips. Higher temperature data was not possible due to the high coupling factor to the resonators. In the future, we plan to design some low coupling resonators for better measurements up to the critical temperature. The fit is a crude 2-gap model used in Yang, et al. 29 The gaps values were highly constrained in the model to show the participation of the larger gap (about 12%) even for the polycrystalline films. (d) Internal quality factor (Qi) as a function of temperature. We performed interface cleaning processes to achieve Qi \u2265 10 4 and it is expected to improve further as we mature the fabrication process. Inset shows the reduction in Qi seen for different cpw geometry (plotted as center conductor width for Z0 = 50 Ohms)."

Historically, the low melting point and highly oxidizing nature of magnesium present multi-fold problems and have prevented any sustainable large-scale fabrication of MgB2 devices. We made uniform and smooth large-area as-deposited Mg-B composite films by RF sputtering and substrate biasing. The films were grown on commercially available silicon substrate by adding a lowstress nitride buffer layer. By creating a closed environment with boron capping layer (which forms several nm of viscous crack-free liquid oxide cap) and prevented magnesium evaporation during annealing, we were able to optimize the annealing temperature and time by rapid thermal processor to achieve high Tc. We have further developed fabrication techniques for these films to achieve small critical features (0.5 \u00b5m demonstrated) and high yield. The devices demonstrate high Jc and low rf losses suitable for high temperature/high frequency superconducting photon detectors and transmission lines. The large nonlinear kinetic inductance shown in these films opens a new branch of high frequency superconducting and quantum devices ranging from parametric amplifiers, frequency multipliers to kinetic inductance-based quantum computing qubits 51 and circuits."

                        "MgB2 devices are fabricated by first removing the boron cap with argon ion mill. Because MgB2 decomposes and oxidizes when exposed to an oxidant (e.g. air and water), passivation throughout device fabrication processes is necessary. We developed a tri-purpose titanium-gold bilayer, serving as an excellent passivation layer during fabrication (photolithography), a hardmask, and electrical contact pads after removal as a hardmask everywhere else on which a dielectric layer (silicon, silicon nitride, or aluminum nitride) is deposited for passivation. The devices are patterned by Heidelberg maskless aligner (MLA 150) with AZ5209-E or OiR 620 photoresists. After developing, the titanium layer not covered by photoresist is etched with chlorine ICP (10 sccm of BCl3 and 35 sccm of Cl2 at 7 mTorr with 200-400 W ICP power and 30 W substrate bias power).
