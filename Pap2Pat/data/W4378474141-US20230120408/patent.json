For example, the resistivity can be tailored or tuned over a range from 10 \u03bc\u03a9*cm to 500 \u03bc\u03a9*cm by controlling the Mg/B ratio during the deposition process. In one or more examples, the Mg/B ratio is tuned such that for a resistivity in the range 50-500 \u03bcOhm*cm, the critical temperature Tc only varies from 26K-32K.",

For example, shorter annealing times, and/or lower annealing temperatures (e.g., <600\u00b0 C.), and/or thinner MgB2 films may require a thinner cap layer.",
