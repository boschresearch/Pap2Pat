                        "Cancer development involves dynamic and reciprocal interactions between neoplastic cells, activated stromal cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and soluble molecules in their vicinity. Together these environmental factors foster the malignant phenotype. Intertwined with these hallmarks of cancer development is the fact that tumor cells metabolize glucose largely via aerobic glycolysis as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation, and produce lactate in a less energy-efficient manner, i.e., the Warburg effect. This distinct metabolic state is common to most solid tumors, including breast cancers, and is thought to contribute to their chemo-resistance. Thus altered metabolism may limit efficacy of standard anti-cancer therapy, but this feature may also be used to identify and characterize subtypes of neoplastic tissue.",
                        "Pathological techniques have always been critical in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Classic morphologic criteria, based on vital dyes and light microscopy, have been complemented by immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling, leading to histological markers of growth factor receptor status or transcriptomic signatures that, for example, predict an individual's likely treatment response. However, all current histological analyses are \u2018blind\u2019 to the spatially ordered metabolic dynamics of the tumor. Metabolic fluxes are closer to function than static markers and may therefore correlate better with phenotypic behavior.",
                        "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is an increasing public health problem. AD, like other central nervous system (CNS) degenerative diseases, is characterized by disturbances in protein production, accumulation, and clearance. In AD, dysregulation in the metabolism of the protein, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2), is indicated by a massive buildup of this protein in the brains of those with the disease. Because of the severity and increasing prevalence of this disease in the population, it is urgent that better treatments be developed.",
                        "A need exists, therefore, for methods and systems for analyzing the in vivo kinetics of biomolecules or therapeutic agents in a variety of pathologies. In particular, methods and systems are needed for modeling metabolic flux, kinetic measurement, and the localization of biomolecules associated with disease state, or progression and therapeutic agents relating to efficacy and resistance. Such a model or system may serve as a useful tool in the characterization and treatment of the underlying processes of disease."

The present disclosure is based, at least in part, on the discovery that coupling NanoSIMS with SILK (the new method coined stable isotope labeled kinetics-secondary ion mass spectrometry (SILK-SIMS)) can spatially and quantitatively analyze biomolecule dynamics, including for example kinetics and metabolism in vivo. As shown herein, it has been demonstrated that the disclosed systems and methods are effective in being able to localize and quantify the stable, non-radioactive isotope 13C in cells, mouse brains, and the human brain.",
                        "NanoSIMS is an important and routinely employed analytical method for investigating isotopic compositions in the fields of Material Science, Cosmochemistry, and Geochemistry; however, this technique remains under-utilized in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences. In the disclosed technique, a focused primary ion beam is electrostatically scanned across the tissue producing secondary ions. These secondary ions are transmitted through ion optics (similarly to visible light in microscopes, but using electrostatic lenses) for mass separation and detection of elemental isotopes, which can be measured to generate a quantitative spatial profile of biological tissue. By analogy this technology is akin to PET imaging, but at the isotopic level and with ultra-high sensitivity and spatial resolution (100 nm).",
                        "As described herein, this analytical method has been coupled to in vivo SILK to spatially and quantitatively quantify deposition of newly synthesized protein into amyloid plaques in AD brain in a method coined stable isotope labeled kinetics-secondary ion mass spectrometry (SILK-SIMS). Furthermore, the first metabolic images of plaque growth in both human and mouse brain were generated. This finding can open an entire field in aggregated protein research and ultrastructural metabolic and kinetic rates in the nervous system. This discovery has led and accelerated the launch of a clinical study to label patients in hospice before death and brain donation with the first measures of Alzheimer's disease metabolic growth of plaques measured at the nanometer scale. As such, the disclosed methods and systems can generate profound insights into mechanisms of physiology, metabolism and kinetics of a variety of health/disease states that will be useful for development of tests and treatments through target validation studies.",
                        "This invention can be useful as a tool for measuring the metabolism and determining the site localization of biomolecules (e.g., lipids, proteins, peptides, carbohydrates) and therapeutic agent (e.g., pharmaceutical agents or scheduled drugs) in biological samples at nanometer resolution. This invention provides precise sub-cellular localization and metabolism of compounds in vivo. This comes with the added benefit that sample perturbations engendered by staining or genetic label incorporation are avoided.",
                        "This invention is currently applied to Alzheimer's disease research, but can be translated to other aspects of neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, and other diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes (not inclusive) to expedite development of treatments. The disclosed methods and systems can contribute to the advancement in the understanding physiology and pathophysiology.",

For example, when applied to a tumor, the present methods can reveal heterogeneous spatial distributions of newly synthesized versus pre-existing lipids, with altered molecular flux patterns distinguishing region-specific intra-tumor subpopulations or calculate the rate of glucose consumption as a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. In the context of AD, SILK-SIMS can reveal the quantity and kinetics of A\u03b2 plaque deposition in human AD brain. This approach can characterize the diversity of molecular flux across heterogeneous tissue, enable identification of specific molecules involved in metabolism of region-specific cell subpopulations and enable identification of resistance mechanisms to drugs.",

The concept of SILK-SIMS and the resulting metabolic flux histopathology images, is analogous to traditional static microscopy, such as vital dyes, in situ hybridization histochemistry, immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy. In these traditional static microscopies, dye-binding molecules, mRNA transcripts, protein antigens or electron-scattering structures, respectively, are visualized and mapped in a tissue. In the present disclosure, the dynamic metabolic fluxes of biomolecules or therapeutic agents and metabolic pathways, rather than their structure or concentration are detected, localized, imaged, and quantified.",

Metabolic fluxes can refer to kinetics of small molecules, polymers, or macromolecules. Fluxes or rates of metabolic processes that can be imaged in a tissue and include, in non-limiting examples, protein/protein aggregation, synthesis, degradation, oxidation, reduction, methylation, polymerization, conjugation, addition, condensation, cleavage, re-arrangement, and other chemical reactions, as well as physical movement in space including transport, accessibility, storage, secretion, uptake, or other dynamic processes occurring in a living organism.",

Therapeutic agents can comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly hydrogen bonding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxyl group, and usually at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate molecules can comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups.",
                                "A therapeutic agent can be a compound in a library database of compounds. One of skill in the art will be generally familiar with, for example, numerous databases for commercially available compounds for screening (see e.g., ZINC database, UCSF, with 2.7 million compounds over 12 distinct subsets of molecules; Irwin and Shoichet (2005) J Chem Inf Model 45, 177-182). One of skill in the art will also be familiar with a variety of search engines to identify commercial sources or desirable compounds and classes of compounds for further testing (see e.g., ZINC database; eMolecules.com; and electronic libraries of commercial compounds provided by vendors, for example: ChemBridge, Princeton BioMolecular, Ambinter SARL, Enamine, ASDI, Life Chemicals etc.).",
                                "Therapeutic agents for use according to the methods described herein include both lead-like compounds and drug-like compounds. A lead-like compound is generally understood to have a relatively smaller scaffold-like structure (e.g., molecular weight of about 150 to about 350 kD) with relatively fewer features (e.g., less than about 3 hydrogen donors and/or less than about 6 hydrogen acceptors; hydrophobicity character x log P of about \u22122 to about 4) (see e.g., Angewante (1999) Chemie Int. ed. Engl. 24, 3943-3948). In contrast, a drug-like compound is generally understood to have a relatively larger scaffold (e.g., molecular weight of about 150 to about 500 kD) with relatively more numerous features (e.g., less than about 10 hydrogen acceptors and/or less than about 8 rotatable bonds; hydrophobicity character x log P of less than about 5) (see e.g., Lipinski (2000) J. Pharm. Tox. Methods 44, 235-249). Initial screening can be performed with lead-like compounds.",
                                "When designing a lead from spatial orientation data, it can be useful to understand that certain molecular structures are characterized as being \u201cdrug-like\u201d. Such characterization can be based on a set of empirically recognized qualities derived by comparing similarities across the breadth of known drugs within the pharmacopoeia. While it is not required for drugs to meet all, or even any, of these characterizations, it is far more likely for a drug candidate to meet with clinical successful if it is drug-like.",
                                "Several of these \u201cdrug-like\u201d characteristics have been summarized into the four rules of Lipinski (generally known as the \u201crules of fives\u201d because of the prevalence of the number 5 among them). While these rules generally relate to oral absorption and are used to predict bioavailability of compound during lead optimization, they can serve as effective guidelines for constructing a lead molecule during rational drug design efforts such as may be accomplished by using the methods of the present disclosure.",
                                "The four \u201crules of five\u201d state that a candidate drug-like compound should have at least three of the following characteristics: (i) a weight less than 500 Daltons; (ii) a log of P less than 5; (iii) no more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (expressed as the sum of OH and NH groups); and (iv) no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (the sum of N and O atoms). Also, drug-like molecules typically have a span (breadth) of between about 8 \u212b to about 15 \u212b.",

This disclosure further provides developing a model by determining and predicting steady state molecular kinetic parameters. Also provided are methods for using the model to identify a subject's health/disease state. The method of developing the model may include, but is not limited to, measuring a concentration of a labeled moiety introduced into a subject over a period of time. The labeled moiety may be incorporated into a biomolecule, a biomolecule precursor, or therapeutic agent within the subject or may be incorporated into a biomolecule, a biomolecule precursor, or therapeutic agent and administered to the subject. The method may further include measuring concentrations in a biological sample of the biomolecule or therapeutic agent incorporating the isotope label in the subject, and incorporating the measured data into known or hypothesized relationships and/or metabolic processes. In an aspect, the method may comprise developing a model which may predict the measured values.

In one aspect, this representation within the model may include a compartment, a rate constant, flow equation, and/or any other mathematical representation known in the art without limitation. In an aspect, the concentration in a compartment may be calculated by multiplying the concentration in the previous compartment by a transfer rate constant between the two compartments minus any irreversible loss.

All isotope labeled precursors may be purchased commercially, for example, from Cambridge Isotope Labs (Andover, Mass.). Generally, the choice of amino acid is based on a variety of factors such as: (1) the amino acid generally is present in at least one residue of the protein or peptide of interest; (2) the amino acid is generally able to quickly reach the site of protein synthesis and rapidly equilibrate to a region of interest; (3) the amino acid ideally may be an essential amino acid (not produced by the body), so that a higher percent of labeling may be achieved; (4) the amino acid label generally does not influence the metabolism of the protein of interest (e.g., very large doses of leucine may affect muscle metabolism); and (5) the relatively wide availability of the desired amino acid (i.e., some amino acids are much more expensive or harder to manufacture than others).",

To achieve steady-state levels of the labeled biomolecule, the labeling time generally should be of sufficient duration so that the labeled biomolecule may be reliably quantified. This duration may be selected to be sufficient to result in saturation of the biochemical pathways associated with the synthesis of the biomolecule. In one aspect, the duration may be sufficient to result in the saturation of the biochemical pathways associated with the synthesis and kinetics of at least one A\u03b2 isoform in the brain of a subject, including, but not limited to: APP synthesis, cleavage of C99 and the at least one A\u03b2 isoform, the transport of the at least one A\u03b2 isoform to the CSF, and the transport of the at least one A\u03b2 isoform to the blood. In another aspect, the saturation of the biochemical pathways may be indicated by the detection of stabilized levels of the at least one A\u03b2 isoform in the CSF and/or blood as measured in a patient. In another aspect, the duration may be sufficient to result in the saturation of the biochemical pathways associated cancer development, tumor progression or apoptosis.",

Generally, the amount is dependent on (and estimated by) the following factors. (1) The type of analysis desired. For example, to achieve a steady state of about 15% labeled leucine in plasma requires about 2 mg/kg/hr over 9 hr after an initial bolus of about 3 mg/kg over 10 min. In contrast, if no steady state is required, a bolus of labeled leucine (e.g., about 400 mg to about 800 mg of labeled leucine) may be given. (2) The biomolecule or therapeutic agent under analysis. For example, if the A\u03b2 variant is being produced rapidly, then less labeling time may be needed and less label may be needed\u2014perhaps as little as 100 mg or less as a bolus. And (3) the sensitivity of the technology to detect label. For example, as the sensitivity of label detection increases, the amount of label that is needed may decrease.",

In another aspect, a labeled moiety is administered on multiple days. In still another aspect, a labeled moiety is administered intravenously as an infusion for about 1 hour. All three methods of administration (oral bolus, IV bolus, and IV infusion) work equally well in terms of providing a reliable measure of amyloid beta metabolism. An intravenous bolus of a labeled moiety and an oral bolus of labeled moiety are easier to administer than an intravenous infusion, and also results in maximal levels of free label at an earlier time point (e.g. about 5 to about 10 minutes, and about 30 to about 60 minutes, respectively, for labeled leucine).

For example, a focused Cs+ primary ion beam is electrostatically rastered across a defined region-of-interest (ROI) in the biological sample producing secondary ions that are used to measure the atomic composition of the sample surface. SILK-SIMS produces high-resolution quantitative image representing an in situ isotopic-histological map at 100 nm lateral resolution. The acquisition of up to five isotopes in parallel allows detection and localization of a stable isotope tracer within a given ROI by enabling the quantitative image ratio of two stable isotopes of the same element.

The methods and software described herein permit the visual representation of data as functional metabolic processes, in the form of heat maps, contour maps or other images by spatial coordinates in a biologic tissue or cell preparation. By way of non-limiting examples, said images may include, for example, plaque dynamics of neuropathies in the brain; glucose uptake by cancer cells; the spatial topology of mitochondrial lipid synthesis in muscle cells; of the spatial distribution of prostanoid and eicosanoid turnover in inflammatory infiltrate tissues; of the pattern of lipogenesis in biopsies of cancer or precancer, and the presence of functional hot spots within a tumor; of the topology of hormonal synthesis in an endocrine tissue; for the presence of autonomous functional areas; for localization of regenerating cells and cell membranes, in a tissue, as in peripheral neuropathies; for the identification of spatially-localized timed biosynthetic events in a tissue based on calculated precursor pool enrichments; and many other means of representing the dense information generated about metabolic fluxes in space and time.",

                                "In some embodiments, the methods can use at least two different biomolecules to resolve and identify adducts, degradation products, and multiple charge states for molecules. Molecules which can be monitored include molecules such as sugars, polysaccharides, lipids, metabolites, proteins, enzymes, nucleotides, etc. In some embodiments the two different biomolecules result in the concurrence of the at least two labels on a single biomolecule or chemical structure.",
                                "Given that control over biological processes is generally exerted as rate control, by the regulation of catalytic reactions and the partitioning of molecules through competing pathways, metabolic fluxes directly reveal the activity of functional processes and pathways in a tissue and often have functional significance in their own right. Because of the information density and spatial definition of the metabolic flux data produced by the method disclosed herein, biologically or medically heterogeneities useful information can be gleaned from metabolic flux patterns that are observed within a tissue, such as regions of increased or reduced metabolic fluxes, regions that differ or are similar for metabolic fluxes, complex signatures of metabolic fluxes for multiple molecules, complex patterns or gradients of metabolic fluxes for specific cells, organelles or structures, or other quantitative parameters related to the metabolic fluxes detected. Specifically, unique functional information about a tissue can be inferred from spatially-identified and patterns of dynamic processes (e.g., the degree of heterogeneity; the ratios of different molecular flux rates in selected areas of the tissue; regions of the tissue that are metabolically linked; shared or differing metabolic precursor pools; etc.), providing potential signatures of each individual's disease phenotype that have prognostic or therapeutic significance. Spatially-identified heterogeneities and patterns of dynamic processes can also focus more in-depth further analysis to specific regions of the tissue or to molecules or metabolic pathways that are identified as being altered and of interest.",
                                "The combination of SILK-SIMS can reveal cell-specific or subcellular structure-specific functional information throughout a tissue, without the need of traditional static hispathological markers. Interrogation of tissue specimens collected from subjects with conditions such as cancer, inflammation, neurologic disorders, immune diseases, infections, fibrotic diseases, diabetes, obesity, arteriosclerosis, endocrine disorders, etc. for functional metabolic flux mapping and metabolic flux signatures thereby provides a novel and powerful tool for characterizing the phenotype (behavior, prognosis, pathogenic sub-class, optimal treatment strategy, response to ongoing treatment, etc.) for a tissue or disease.",
                                "SILK-SIMS provides numerous applications in medical or veterinary diagnostics, companion diagnostics, drug discovery, drug efficacy and development and biologic research are evident, and are described herein. These include functional histopathologic display and mapping in disease tissues such as cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, metabolic disorders, atherosclerosis or neuropathology, for diagnosis, therapeutic targeting, patient stratification and personalized medicine. In particular, kinetic signatures or fingerprints in a tissue can be correlated with disease behavior or treatment response, for use in medical or veterinary disease management or in medical diagnosis and companion diagnostics.",
                                "Biomedical applications of SILK-SIMS, include for example functional imaging of histopathology in disease tissues, such as cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, metabolic disorders, neuropathology, for spatial in homogeneities that reveal areas of increased or reduced rates of a functional process (hot spots or cold spots, respectively), for diagnosis, therapeutic targeting, patient stratification or personalized medicine. Specific applications, for example, mapping cholesterol turnover in the core of an atherosclerotic plaque in a blood vessel, and the capacity of a high-density lipoprotein treatment to mobilize cholesterol from the core of a plaque; imaging autophagic pathways fluxes based on the turnover of proteins or peptides derived from proteins that are autophagic substrates, in a different regions of a cancerous tissue, neurologic tissue, or muscle tissue; displaying lipid synthetic fluxes or structural protein synthetic fluxes in different cellular compartments of muscle tissue from a sarcopenic or cachectic subject, including cardiolipin turnover in mitochodria, fatty acid synthesis and turnover in myocytes and in the extracellular space, as a biomarker of muscle quality or response to treatment; measuring the turnover of aggregated proteins, such as amyloid beta in Alzheimer's plaque, huntingtin or alpha-synuclein in neurodegenerative diseases, or of cellular storage granules, such as insulin in pancreatic beta cells; monitoring loss of labeled palmitate, glucose or other energy substrates from oxidative tissues like skeletal muscle or failing heart, as a marker of fuel utilization by specific cells in a tissue; visualizing myelin synthesis in the central or peripheral nervous system, in settings of demyelination, neurodegeneration or neuropathy; displaying the turnover of cell membrane receptors in disease states such as the epithelial sodium transporter in hypertension or the CFTR in bronchi in cystic fibrosis, LDL cholesterol receptor turnover in tissues from hyperlipidemic subjects and in response to lipid-lowering agents; metabolic conversion of steroid hormones to their active forms and target sites in a target organ, such as testosterone reduction to dihydrotestosterone in prostate tissue or muscle specimens and the effect of dihydrotestosterone inhibitors.",
                                "SILK-SIMS may also be used for functional imaging of disease tissues, such as cancer, for kinetic signatures correlated with disease behavior or treatment response, for use in medical or veterinary disease management or in medical diagnosis and companion diagnostics. Specific applications include, for example, mapping lipid metabolic fluxes and protein turnover across cancer tissue slides, to identify hot spots and heterogeneity, as a marker of cancer aggressiveness or response to treatment; measuring lipid flux patterns in tissues potentially exhibiting lipotoxicity, such as muscle, pancreas and liver, to identify metabolic flux fingerprints associated with insulin resistance or diabetes risk; imaging patterns of lipid turnover in areas of skin in subjects with eczema or psoriasis as signatures of disease behavior or likely response to treatments, including response to cosmetic treatments; monitoring the patterns of transport of cargo proteins along neurons in different areas on the brain in neurodegenerative diseases; and many others apparent in the art.",
                                "SILK-SIMS may also be used for determination of the timing of spatially-localized kinetic processes, such as embryologic or other developmental events, by imposition of timed precursor label administration or a temporal gradient of precursor label administration, and displaying precursor pool enrichments for molecules in different locations within a tissue; determination of biosynthetic origins or metabolic sources of molecules in spatially-localized regions of cells (e.g., identifying the tissue or subcellular origin of transported molecules); or characterization of subcellular functional organization\u2014for example, kinetic processes in subcellular organelles, lipid droplets, storage granules, secretory vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, etc. as a tool for understanding the in vivo regulation and control of metabolic flux in a tissue.",

                                "In vivo stable isotope labeling & quantitative mass spectrometry imaging of A\u03b2 plaque deposition in human AD brain Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by alterations in the clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain1,2,3,4. Studies utilizing in vivo incorporation of the stable isotope 13C6-leucine into A\u03b2 in AD patients1,2 demonstrated that while the production of A\u03b240 and 42 are similar between AD and control (non-AD, age-matched) subjects, the clearance of A\u03b2 is decreased \u02dc30-50%3,4. At the onset of amyloidosis, the A\u03b242 proteoform demonstrates faster turnover kinetics, possibly due to rapid deposition into plaques (\u02dc50% of all A\u03b242 produced) as suggested by a positive correlation between increased A\u03b242 turnover kinetics and rate of fibrillar amyloidosis measured by PET Pittsburgh compound B (PIB)4. However, these studies4 relied on CSF, which are indirect kinetic measurements of brain compartment A\u03b2. Recent evidence also demonstrates that PIB binds to only a subset of A\u03b2 from plaques enriched from AD brain5. The implication of these recent findings suggests that studies utilizing PIB may be potentially underestimating the extent and rate of A\u03b2 deposition and/or only measuring localized fibrillar pathology. The examples provided herein report the first measurements of protein deposition into amyloid-\u03b2 plaques in human AD brain and an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Post-mortem brain from participants labeled with 13C6-leucine in vivo for stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK) combined with nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (NanoSIMS) imaging was used in a combined approach termed SILK-SIMS to quantity A\u03b2 plaque deposition in human AD brain and APP/PS1 mice. The inventors found in controlled imaging experiments an isotopic enrichment of the 13C isotope above the natural abundance ratio of 13C/12C (1.1%) restricted to the periphery of A\u03b2 plaques. In APP/PS1 mice orally labeled for 10 weeks starting before plaque pathology, the 13C/12C isotope ratio was 2.7% with distinctly higher enrichment at the periphery compared to the core of the plaque. Metabolically active cells such as a nearby neuron demonstrated 13C/12C ratio of 3.7%. These results demonstrate that amyloid plaque deposition can be quantified to address the unanswered question of \u201cWhat is the rate of amyloid Alzheimer's pathology in humans?\u201d It is anticipated that these results will lead to a more accurate estimate of plaque growth, which can be utilized to determine the rate of A\u03b2 pathology prior to the onset of AD clinical symptoms. New insights into amyloid kinetics in vivo will inform efforts for improved diagnostic test(s) to detect the early, prodromal stage of AD, accelerate AD drug trial development, and facilitate a direct comparison between depositions determined by SILK-SIMS to those derived from PET-PIB. Furthermore, the protocols established herein can be translated to other disorders including in non-limiting examples neurodegenerative disease, metabolic diseases, and cancer.",

                                "In recent studies utilizing in vivo incorporation of the stable isotope 13C6-leucine in AD patients,1-4 A\u03b242 demonstrated faster turnover kinetics. This was attributed to rapid deposition into plaques for \u02dc50% of all A\u03b242 produced4 due to a positive correlation between increased A\u03b242 turnover kinetics and rate of amyloidosis measured by PET-PiB.4 However, accurate measures of plaque growth and turnover\u2014a reflection of the rate and extent of disease pathology\u2014are marred by analytical challenges. In vivo A\u03b2 kinetics4 has relied on CSF, which is an indirect measure of the brain compartment. Further, evidence suggests that PiB only binds a subset of A\u03b25 and repeated studies of amyloid PET may measure binding site changes over time,16 not necessarily the growth or turnover kinetics of A\u03b2 in human AD brain. Methodological challenges with anti-A\u03b2 antibody or dye specificity and decreased sensitivity due to tissue autofluorescence limit fluorescence-based assessments.",

In SILK-SIMS, a focused Cs+ primary ion beam is electrostatically rastered across a defined region-of-interest (ROI) in the tissue producing secondary ions that are used to measure the atomic composition of the sample surface. SILK-SIMS produces high-resolution quantitative image representing an in situ isotopic-histological map at 100 nm lateral resolution. The acquisition of up to five isotopes in parallel allows detection and localization of a stable, non-radioactive isotope tracer within a given ROI by enabling the quantitative image ratio of two stable isotopes of the same element.20 The incorporation of the tracer 13C6-leucine for instance is detectable by an increase in the 13C/12C ratio above natural abundance (1.11%) with high sensitivity (0.1-0.2%) and precision.",
                                "To quantify carbon isotopes in biological material, carbon was measured as 12C\u2212, 13C\u2212, 12C14N\u2212, and 13C14N\u2212 simultaneously. Evident from these measurements is the improved image quality when carbon isotopes were detected as cyanide ions (12C14N\u2212 and 13C14N\u2212) rather than monoisotopes (FIG. 4). The improved isotope image quality with detailed histology may be due to i) the higher ionization potential of cyanide ions compared to carbon as evidenced by the signal intensity (Cts/s), ii) the nitrogen content of biological materials with CN\u2212 molecules being most abundant in proteins (18% by total weight) compared to RNA and DNA (1.1% and 0.25%, respectively)20,21 and iii) the reduction of carbon contribution of the embedding media, which contributes a large fraction of 12C\u2212 ions20 (FIG. 5). Quantitatively, data analysis using the CN\u2212 molecules achieves improved accuracy and precision compared to C\u2212 alone (FIG. 6). Using CN\u2212 we characterized the NanoSIMS signal response for 13C6-leucine enrichment, by labeling a B-cell hybridoma grown in leucine-free media supplemented with an increasing percentage of 13C6-leucine. FIG. 1 demonstrates the linearity of response in NanoSIMS measurements of cells treated with increasing percent of 13C6-leucine (R2=0.99546) and a raw and normalized y-intercept of 0.0106\u00b11.53\u00d710\u22124 and 0.0111\u00b12.25\u00d710\u22124, respectively. NanoSIMS measurement accuracies are within 3-6% and \u00b12% of the natural abundance of 13C and a precision of \u00b10% and \u00b10.05% for raw and normalized data, respectively (FIG. 7).",
                                "To assess the feasibility of detecting 13C6-leucine isotopic enrichment in native amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, tracer was administered to APP/PS1 mice at 3.5 months of age (pre-plaque pathology) for 10 and 5 weeks (FIG. 2A). The APP/PS1 mouse labeled for 10 consecutive weeks (FIGS. 2B-2E) reached raw and normalized 13C14N\u2212/12C14N\u2212 ratios of 0.023\u00b11.41\u00d710\u22125 and 0.024\u00b13.43\u00d710\u22124 respectively, compared to background (i.e., brain parenchyma) in Area 1 (0.021\u00b11.28\u00d710\u22125 and 0.022\u00b13.15\u00d710\u22124, raw and normalized) and Area 2 (0.021\u00b11.13\u00d710\u22125 and 0.022\u00b13.19\u00d710\u22124, raw and normalized) (FIG. 8). Thus demonstrating that the incorporation and measurement of 13C6-leucine into A\u03b2 plaques is feasible, but also non-random (i.e., non-homogeneous distribution of incorporated tracer). Features that were more metabolically active incorporated more tracer compared to brain parenchyma. As shown in FIG. 9, a neuron (a hyper-metabolic cell) from the 10-week labeled mouse incorporated substantially more tracer that the surrounding parenchyma (neuron=0.031\u00b12.53\u00d710\u22125 and 0.032\u00b14.66\u00d710\u22124 vs Area 1=0.023\u00b11.70\u00d710\u22125 and 0.024\u00b13.41\u00d710\u22124 vs Area 2=0.023\u00b17.17\u00d710\u22126 and 0.024\u00b13.50\u00d710\u22124 raw and normalized, respectively) and the plaque (0.023\u00b11.41\u00d710\u22125 and 0.024\u00b13.43\u00d710\u22124 raw and normalized, respectively).",
                                "The APP/PS1 mouse labeled for 5 consecutive weeks followed by a 5-week washout period, continued to demonstrate 13C6-leucine tracer enrichment relative to natural abundance (0.015\u00b11.56\u00d710\u22125 and 0.015\u00b12.22\u00d710\u22124 raw and normalized) and the surrounding parenchyma (FIG. 2F-I). Despite begin labeled for half the amount of time, the plaque enrichment was approximately two-thirds of that measured in the 10-week labeled animal. However, plasma leucine measurements taken from these mice at time of sacrifice show that the 13C6-leucine tracer declined to less than 1/10th of the tracer content found in the 10-week labeled mouse (TABLE 1). This observation would be expected if A\u03b2 plaques had a slower turnover rate. Of note, the 13C enrichment (\u03b4) was substantial in the core region of the plaque (\u02dc700\u2030 or 70%), but much reduced in the peripheral region (\u02dc190\u2030 or 19%) around the plaque representing either growth after the 5-week tracer period or washout from the periphery inward of a fully labeled plaque.",
                                "In order to study the variability in SILK-SIMS imaging, test-retest analyses were conducted on the mouse and human images. However, because this technique is destructive, the ROIs chosen for imaging will not remain the same over the course of two separate, individual measurements. Therefore, the isotope variability within the cycles of individual images was measured as data acquisition can take between 1-18 hrs depending on the level of isotopic enrichment and precision needed. There was no significant difference in the test re-test reliability 13C14N\u2212/12C14N\u2212 ratios of individual features in APP/PS1 mouse brain (FIG. 10). The test-retest-reliability coefficient of the pixel-to-pixel correlation between image cycles over time showed high reliability (neuron, 1.1 hr acquisition, Spearman's r=0.9715, p<0.0001; plaque, 0.91 hr acquisition, Spearman's r=0.7573, p<0.0001). Bland-Altman22 test-retest-reliability also demonstrated a high level of agreement with the isotope images on a per pixel basis over time, as nearly all fell within a 95% confidence interval (FIG. 11; TABLES 2-5). However, to obtain the level of precision and accuracy seen in the standard curve (FIG. 1) and animal labeling (FIG. 2, FIG. 7, FIG. 9, FIG. 11) paradigms, particularly when low enrichment is expected (e.g., human samples), overnight measurements are required. In such cases the need to ascertain the reliability of test results over time\u2014test-retest reliability\u2014is paramount. The pixel-to-pixel test re-test reliability comparing even and odd cycles as well as the first and last 20 cycles (\u02dc6 hrs each) of the 40 cycle image of an unlabeled human A\u03b2 plaque feature (FIGS. 12A-12C, and FIGS. 12F-12H) showed very high coefficients of stability (even vs odd, Spearman's r=1, p<0.0001; 1st half vs 2nd half, Spearman's r=0.9989, p<0.0001). Likewise, all pixel-to-pixel comparisons fell within a 95% confidence interval (FIG. 13D, FIG. 13I; TABLE 2-5) and no significant difference in the 13C14N\u2212/12C14N\u2212 ratios was present (FIG. 12E, FIG. 12J) demonstrating our results are consistent over time. We focused on the plaque feature instead of the whole image in order to avoid the astigmatism apparent at the edges of larger (80 \u03bcm) images such as this one.",

The targeted precursor ions were sequentially isolated in the quadrupole and fragmented in the Orbitrap using HCD (isolation width 1.6 Da, normalized collision energy 25%, activation Q 0.250, and activation time 10 ms). The general mass spectrometric conditions were as follows: spray voltage 2.2 kV, 60% S-lens, and ion transfer tube temperature 275\u00b0 C.",

Retention time alignment was based on the 15N internal standard. The sum of all transitions (b ions monitored for each parent peptide) were summed for unlabeled and SILK A\u03b2 peptides and exported from Skyline to Excel. The ratios of SILK/unlabeled of each replicate (triplicate injections) for Pt2 sample was taken followed by isotopic background subtraction of the mean ratio of an unlabeled participant to give the tracer-to-tracee ratio (TTR) minus background. Next, the background subtracted TTRs were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation (i.e., take the mean of the area ratios) of enrichment for each A\u03b2 peptide.",

These brain donations contain proteins, which were synthesized during the labeling period, and can now be measured in ultra-high (100 nm) resolution to quantify new protein generation and clearance in the human brain. As most of the brain samples have Alzheimer's disease pathology, we will be able to image how this pathology changes over time. We will use NanoSIMS isotopic imaging of ultrathin sections of post-autopsy AD brain tissue, which is labeled during life, to detect the newly generated proteins in the human brain and around amyloid plaques. With this technique, we are able to: i) determine the 13C/12C ratio, ii) have a high signal-to-noise ratio and iii) image micro-ultrastructural features of the plaque and surrounding neural and glial features. We expect the NanoSIMS can successfully produce carbon isotope maps in brains from AD patients; newly synthesized protein, inferred from the 13C6-leucine label, will be detected in the surrounding plaque area. Data will be generated from seven brain donations, which were previously labeled with SILK at early disease stages (pre-symptomatic to mild). These data will allow the visualization of amyloid plaque growth in vivo and will be central to accurately computing A\u03b2 brain kinetics in a computational mathematical framework.",

These calculations are central to understanding the AD pathophysiology process to better develop tests of AD pathology and also to estimate the dose and frequency of drugs, which are now targeting AD pathology.",
                                "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline. The disease progression is irreversible; no therapeutics can prevent, slow, or cure AD. Its impact on human health is significant. AD affects an estimated 5.3 million individuals in the USA (1). This number is projected to increase to 13.8 million by 2050\u2014representing a true epidemic\u2014and cost more than $1 trillion to our national healthcare system (1, 2). One prominent feature of AD is a marked thousand-fold increase in extracellular amyloid-beta (A\u03b2), implicated as a toxic neurodegeneration-inducing species (3). The accumulation of A\u03b2 leads to one of the pathological hallmarks of AD\u2014amyloid plaques.",
                                "Recent studies utilizing in vivo incorporation of the stable isotope 13C6-leucine into A\u03b2 in AD patients (4, 5) demonstrated that while the production of A\u03b240 and 42 are similar between AD and control (non-AD, age-matched) subjects, the clearance of A\u03b2 is decreased by approximately 30-50% (6, 7). With increasing age, the single largest risk factor of AD, the half-life of A\u03b2 (i.e., turnover or clearance), slows 2.5-fold from 3.8 hr to 9.4 hr (6, 7). Intriguingly, with the onset of amyloidosis, only the A\u03b242 isoform demonstrated faster turnover kinetics, possibly due to a rapid deposition into plaques for \u02dc50% of all A\u03b242 produced (7), suggested by a positive correlation between increased A\u03b242 turnover kinetics and rate of fibrillar amyloidosis as measured by PET Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) (7). This is consistent with studies that implicate A\u03b242 as the major constituent in amyloid plaques. Despite advances in our understanding of A\u03b2 kinetics in vivo, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of AD amyloid pathology the brain. First, these studies (7) relied on CSF and plasma, which are indirect measures of brain compartment A\u03b2. Next, there is evidence demonstrating that PIB binds to only a subset of A\u03b2 from plaques enriched from AD brain (8). The implication of these recent findings suggest that studies utilizing PIB or amyloid imaging agents to measure A\u03b2 in patients for early detection and monitoring of AD may be potentially underestimating the extent and rate of A\u03b2 deposition and/or only measuring localized fibrillar pathology. Correct measures are critical for drug trial programs, which need to estimate the amount and rate of amyloid to estimate dose and frequency.",
                                "Thus, we hypothesize that: i) direct measurement of the rates of amyloid pathology growth is possible by SILK brain studies in humans, ii) the irreversible loss of A\u03b2 is largely due to plaque deposition, and iii) that the rate of this deposition may be greater and occurs earlier than previously reported by PET PIB studies. This translationally-focused proposal couples in vivo brain SILK with nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (NanoSIMS) imaging to spatially and quantitatively profile deposition of newly synthesized protein into amyloid plaques in AD brain (FIG. 3). The proposed study provides a unique, first-in-human, opportunity to measure A\u03b2 kinetics directly in the brain with AD pathology. The outcomes of these objectives will provide new insights in order to develop improved diagnostic test(s) to detect the early, prodromal stage of AD and to better understand the AD amyloid pathology process, in order to accelerate AD drug development.",
                                "NanoSIMS is an advanced mass spectrometry imaging technology that allows for the generation of nanoscale isotopic maps through the parallel acquisition of up to five isotopes at the subcellular level, with high sensitivity (\u22641 ppm) and high spatial resolution (50-100 nm) (11). Yet, this technology has been rarely utilized in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences. While NanoSIMS has recently been applied to the study of AD (12, 13), NanoSIMS imaging has not been used for protein quantitation or in combination with SILK for the measurement of in vivo protein kinetics in normal or diseased brain (e.g. AD). We propose to characterize the spatial distribution of newly synthesized protein (via 13C6-leucine labeling) deposition into amyloid plaques in AD brain tissue, while capitalizing on the temporal component (i.e., varying times between labeling and time of death in our cohort) to calculate deposition kinetics.",
                                "As a result, this research could shift the current paradigm by providing the first quantitative measure of deposition into amyloid plaques by exploiting cutting-edge methodologies never before leveraged in the field of AD or neurodegeneration. These measures will lead to a more accurate estimate of plaque growth, which can be utilized to determine the rate of A\u03b2 pathology prior to the onset of AD clinical symptoms. The full implications and extent of this work will facilitate a direct comparison between depositions determined by our SILK-NanoSIMS imaging approach to those derived from PET-PIB.",

                                "NanoSIMS is an important and routinely employed analytical method for investigating isotopic compositions in the fields of Material Science, Cosmochemistry, and Geochemistry; however, this technique remains under-utilized in the Biological and Biomedical Sciences. Unlabeled brain still contains a natural abundance 13C (1.1% of the abundance of 12C) that is detectable and measurable by the NanoSIMS (FIG. 23). In this technique, a focused (\u02dc100 nm in diameter) Cs+ primary ion beam is electrostatically scanned across the defined region of interest (ROI) in the tissue (i.e., plaque) producing secondary ions. These secondary ions are transmitted through ion optics (similarly to visible light in microscopes, but using electrostatic lenses) for mass separation and detection of 12C and 13C (monoisotopic mass 12.0 and 13.0 Da, respectively) for the generation of a quantitative spatial profile of carbon isotopes in the ROI. 13C6-leucine labeled autopsied AD brain tissue obtained from the ADRC, which has been formalin fixed, will be embedded in Epon resin (EM core; Dr. Robert Schmidt). Thin sections (\u02dc0.5 \u03bcm thick) will be produced with an ultra-microtome and stained with toluidine blue for optical microscopy. Adjacent semi-thin sections (300-400 nm thick) will be directly deposited on high-purity silicon wafers for NanoSIMS analysis (FIG. 3). Images of the tissue will be taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), in order to document plaque locations and provide an absolute coordinate system for the tissue. For samples needing to be analyzed in the SEM, we will first gold coat to prevent any carbon deposition that is typical for SEM. In this way, we can use already developed coordinate transformation software, which uses mathematical algorithms to translate those ROIs found in the SEM, to re-locate the same ROIs in the NanoSIMS instrument. Multiple patient samples can be placed on a single Si wafer for analysis in a single run, optimizing efficiency and minimizing cost. After image acquisition, we will determine quantitative mass images of 12C and 13C and calculate the 13C/12C ratios of the sample with already developed, well-established image processing software\u2014both OpenMIMS and L'Image. With the high purity of the 13C label, we expect to be able to observe at least 1-100s of permil (i.e., the percent difference from atomic abundance multiplied by 10) enrichment in 13C. The SEM images, taken beforehand, will allow coordinated analysis of ultra-structural features of the plaque and surrounding neural and glial features (akin to MRI spatial enhancement of PET scans), due to its higher lateral resolution (\u02dc5 down to 0.4 nm with feSEM) than that of the NanoSIMS. These combined techniques will also allow us to more precisely define the spatial areas of 13C/12C enrichment analyzed by the NanoSIMS (akin to PET), in order to provide 13C enrichment density per given area (nm2) vs non-enrichment and to facilitate direct comparison between intrinsic tissue structures.",
                                "With the successful completion of establishing an appropriate NanoSIMS imaging protocol, data will be generated from seven brain donations which were previously labeled with SILK (TABLE 7). A minimum of 10-15 plaques per patient sample (analytical replicates) in the frontal lobe will be measured; 13C above its natural abundance, calculated by the 13C/12C ratio in the ROI (i.e., plaque), will indicate the presence of new protein deposition. The 13C/12C ratio, its spatial distribution (enhanced by complementary high-resolution SEM imaging), and the temporal component (labeling to time of death) will all generate critical values for a computational mathematical framework of A\u03b2 plaque deposition.",
                                "(II) Develop a Computational Mathematical Framework that Accurately Quantifies Leucine-Labeled Protein Deposition into Plaques.",
                                "We have previously developed a physiologically relevant multi-compartmental model (7, 9, 19), to assess A\u03b2 kinetics in vivo and the relationship between A\u03b2 isoform kinetics and patient demographics, such as, age, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and amyloid status. Within this model, we define the variable of the irreversible loss of A\u03b2 (v38, v40, v42), which includes deposition, degradation (enzymatic or via proteosome), and transport across the blood-brain barrier (19). Currently, measuring A\u03b2 isoforms in plasma to solve a component of A\u03b2 irreversible loss through the blood-brain barrier in this model is being studied. However, until now, determining irreversible loss due to plaque deposition in vivo and with methods alternative to PET-PIB (8) has been a missing link.",
                                "Thus, we propose to use the 13C/12C ratio densities in \u201chotspots\u201d\u201413C enrichment beyond its natural abundance\u2014in imaged plaques per area (nm2) versus the 13C/12C ratio densities in \u201cnon-hotspot\u201d areas (i.e., the remainder of the plaque). We predict proteins newly synthesized and deposited within the 9 hr 13C6-leucine injection period to be labeled, whereas unlabeled protein would represent deposition before and after the SILK study. This distinction is aided by the fact that plaques demonstrate lateral circumferential growth (17). The bulk composition of the plaque would represent deposition prior to labeling, newly synthesized protein deposition would theoretically demonstrate a ring of 13C enrichment around the plaque core, and, finally, newly deposited protein after labeling but before death would be represented by a ring of 12C enrichment around the periphery of the 13C abundant ring (FIG. 24). Further, we do not expect significant degradation of proteins after deposition into plaques, thus preserving 13C6-leucine labeling. From the 13C/12C ratios per area (hotspots vs non-hotspots) across a cohort of patients with varying times between labeling and death (TABLE 7), we can derive total protein plaque deposition rates in AD.",
                                "Techniques such as immunogold labeling with SEM or TEM, in parallel with NanoSIMS imaging and/or the development of immuno-depletion of A\u03b2 from the plaques followed by NanoSIMS, would be potentially able to parse A\u03b2 deposition from total protein deposition and are contemplated. Additionally, development of methods to isolate A\u03b2 from plaques within tissue sections for biochemical measurements of 13C/12C will provide orthogonal validation of NanoSIMS measurements. Ultimately, this approach of quantifying nanometer resolution images of SILK labeled proteins in the human brain can be easily translated to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, and stroke, as basic physiology as basic physiology of human brain biomolecule kinetics.",

                                "In the proof-of-principle study, I was able to detect 13C label in brain tissue of this patient who passed 8 days after labeling (FIG. 3 in ref. Wildburger et al., 2018; PMID 29623063), but was unable to detect 13C in other participants who died months to years after labeling (n=5; 0.5-4 years between study and death; data not shown). This is attributed to tracer washout and the high isotopic background of carbon (13C has a natural abundance of 1.1%; there are 90 12C atoms for every 13C atom). Although low levels of 13C can be quantified with SILK-SIMS, the instrument sampling time is \u02dc24 hours/plaque to obtain sufficient signal (i.e., secondary ions). This data acquisition rate is not suitable even for small cohort studies. To optimize the acquisition time, we tested two labeling protocols in 6-month-old male APP/PS1 mice treated with commercially available 15N\u2014 or 13C-labeled Spirulina from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (FIG. 27). Spirulina an edible powder of blue-green algae, and is considered a dietary supplement. I obtained a designated lot of Spirulina and tested it for heavy metals and microcystin toxins. Mice received a single oral dose (0.5 grams) of either 15N-Spirulina or 13C-Spirulina (FIG. 27A), in their water (ad libitum) and were returned to normal drinking water 12 hours later. Subsequently, the treated mice were sacrificed at specific time intervals. SILK-SIMS imaging revealed that 15N was enriched in brain tissue at 4 weeks after the single oral dose (FIG. 27B). By contrast, 13C label rapidly diminished at 24 hours after labeling. Therefore, 15N has substantially longer half-life in brain tissue than 13C. The use of 15N-Spirulina has the following advantages: (i) it is inexpensive (ii) the increased heavy isotope signal reduces SILK-SIMS data acquisition times and background error; (iii) the 15N signal is not affected by the use of carbon-rich embedding resin in fixed specimens, which can affect the 13C signal by reducing the measured 13C levels below natural abundance (FIG. 27C); and (iv)15N has a natural abundance of 0.37% (for every 15N atom there are 272 14N atoms), which generates less background noise then for 13C measurements. Due to the success of 15N-Spirulina labeling in mice, I proceeded to use 10 grams of 15N-Spirulina from the designated lot in the hospice pilot study (Study Protocol FIG. 29).",
                                "We obtain fully informed consent or assent with proxy consent. Then, we administer universally labeled 15N-spirulina to the enrolled hospice participants. The participants' cognitive function and dementia severity is assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)46 and AD847,48 screening tools. We perform a retrospective interview of a reliable collateral source to assess cognitive change using the clinical dementia rating (CDR)49,50 scale. At death, participants are taken to autopsy and a full National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) pathological workup16,17 is performed. The autopsy and workup will allow confirmation of AD diagnosis, define amyloid pathology in cognitively normal participants (CDR0+), and provide linkage between human autopsy specimens and clinical and laboratory data.",

Alternatively in the case of Cisplatin and other drugs we can monitor the heavy metal that is already a component of its chemical structure.

To examine nanoparticle-based drug delivery, cells will be grown on glass, aclar, or LX112 in culture before being embedded (with the glass etc) in resin. We will use hydrogen fluoride to dissolve the glass prior to ultra-thin sectioning as previously described. This novel technique allows us to see nanoparticles intact by SILK-SIMS imaging without risk of collapse of the particle during sample processing.
