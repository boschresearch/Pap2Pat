    "title": "Broadly Neutralizing Antibody PGT121 Allosterically Modulates CD4 Binding via Recognition of the HIV-1 gp120 V3 Base and Multiple Surrounding Glycans",
    "date": "2013-05-02",
    "abstract": "New broad and potent neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies have recently been described that are largely dependent on the gp120 N332 glycan for Env recognition. Members of the PGT121 family of antibodies, isolated from an African donor, neutralize \u223c70% of circulating isolates with a median IC50 less than 0.05 \u00b5g ml(-1). Here, we show that three family members, PGT121, PGT122 and PGT123, have very similar crystal structures. A long 24-residue HCDR3 divides the antibody binding site into two functional surfaces, consisting of an open face, formed by the heavy chain CDRs, and an elongated face, formed by LCDR1, LCDR3 and the tip of the HCDR3. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the antibody paratope reveals a crucial role in neutralization for residues on the elongated face, whereas the open face, which accommodates a complex biantennary glycan in the PGT121 structure, appears to play a more secondary role. Negative-stain EM reconstructions of an engineered recombinant Env gp140 trimer (SOSIP.664) reveal that PGT122 interacts with the gp120 outer domain at a more vertical angle with respect to the top surface of the spike than the previously characterized antibody PGT128, which is also dependent on the N332 glycan. We then used ITC and FACS to demonstrate that the PGT121 antibodies inhibit CD4 binding to gp120 despite the epitope being distal from the CD4 binding site. Together, these structural, functional and biophysical results suggest that the PGT121 antibodies may interfere with Env receptor engagement by an allosteric mechanism in which key structural elements, such as the V3 base, the N332 oligomannose glycan and surrounding glycans, including a putative V1/V2 complex biantennary glycan, are conformationally constrained.",

                "The discovery of novel monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of HIV-1 isolates of various clades (broadly neutralizing antibodies, bnAbs) has rapidly accelerated in the past three years and provided valuable new reagents and opportunities for HIV vaccine design [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In other related fields, similar bursts of activity have identified new bnAbs to influenza and hepatitis C viruses [10], [11], [12], [13]. For HIV-1, screening of thousands of HIV-1 infected individuals in different cohorts has revealed that a relatively large proportion (approximately 20\u201325%) develop sera with moderate to broad neutralization characteristics that requires at least one to three years of infection, and that approximately 1% of infected individuals, termed elite neutralizers, develop an exceptionally broad and potent neutralizing antibody response [4], [14], [15], [16]. Fine-mapping of the broadly neutralizing activity of the elite neutralizers sera on the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein revealed five predominant neutralizing antibody specificities: 1) the CD4 binding site on gp120; 2) glycan-dependent epitopes on gp120 that are N332A sensitive; 3) an epitope in the vicinity of the CD4-induced site; 4) a quaternary epitope on gp120 that is sensitive to the loss of glycosylation at position N160; and 5) the conserved gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER) [17], [18], [19], [20]. The number of bnAbs targeting these sites has increased exponentially in recent years due to the identification of suitable infected donors and the development of new technologies allowing for their identification and isolation [3], [5], [6], [7], [21], [22]. Together, structural and functional characterization of the vulnerable sites on HIV-1 Env, as well as the bnAbs that recognize them, are at the center of current vaccine development efforts.",
                "Long thought as an impenetrable shield masking the conserved functional sites on HIV-1, the dense glycan coat of Env has emerged in recent years as an unexpected target for recognition by bnAbs. One specific area surrounding the base of the V3 loop on the outer domain of gp120 harbors a dense cluster of conserved oligomannose carbohydrates [23], [24], [25], [26]. 2G12, a bnAb capable of neutralizing 32% of a large panel of HIV-1 isolates at an IC50<50 \u00b5g/mL, was found several years ago to recognize an epitope in this region, namely the Man\u03b11-2Man tips of certain oligomannose glycans. The N-linked glycans that have been implicated in the recognition by 2G12 are located at positions N295, N332, N339, N386, and N392 on the gp120 outer domain [5], [27], [28]. More recently, the crystal structure of PGT128 in complex with an engineered gp120 outer domain revealed that this bnAb achieves highly potent neutralization of about 70% of HIV-1 isolates by intimately interacting with two oligomannose glycans at positions N301 and N332, as well as with the base of the gp120 V3 loop [5], [29]. Together, these two bnAbs help to define more precisely the N332 site of vulnerability on HIV-1 Env.",
                "Identified from African donor 17 of the IAVI Protocol G cohort, the PGT121 antibody family consists of three primary members (PGT121, PGT122 and PGT123), and additional antibodies from this donor described recently [30]. At an IC50<50 \u00b5g/mL, this family of bnAbs neutralizes 65\u201370% of HIV-1 isolates and also recognizes an N332-sensitive epitope [5]. Along with PGT128, members of the PGT121 family are the most potent anti-HIV-1 bnAbs identified to date, with a median IC50 ranging between 0.03\u20130.05 \u00b5g/mL [5]. However, the PGT121 family differs from the PGT128 family in that it is not as dependent on glycosylation at position N301 for most isolates and competes more extensively with PG9 binding, which recognizes a quaternary epitope composed principally of the gp120 V1/V2 loop and associated glycans [5]. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of recognition of the N332-sensitive gp120 outer domain epitope by the PGT121 family. Here, we describe the characterization of the PGT121 family at the atomic level by comparing crystal structures of all three family members. Paratope mapping and binding data have enabled characterization of the most crucial elements required for neutralization by this antibody family. Furthermore, we present a molecular-level characterization of the epitope recognized by PGT122 on a recombinant HIV-1 trimer (SOSIP.664) by electron microscopy at 15 \u00c5 resolution. Finally, biophysical experiments reveal that antibodies of the PGT121 family can interfere with gp120 binding to CD4, despite the PGT121 epitope being distally located from the CD4 binding site on gp120."

                        "To characterize the binding site, or paratope, for this new class of bnAbs at the atomic level, crystal structures of the PGT121, 122 and 123 Fabs were determined at resolutions of 2.8, 1.8 and 2.5 \u00c5, respectively (Table 1). Strikingly, the overall structures of the three antibodies are highly similar, with root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d) values calculated for main-chain atoms ranging between 0.7 and 1.2 \u00c5 for the light and heavy chains of the Fv regions of all three antibodies (Fig. 1A), as well as with the previously described 10-1074 antibody of the same class [30]. One of the main characteristics of the paratope is a 24-residue HCDR3 that forms an extended anti-parallel \u03b2-hairpin with either a type-1 \u03b2-turn at its tip for PGT121 and PGT123 or a distorted 310-helix at its tip for PGT122. This elongated HCDR3 divides the antibody recognition site into two faces (Fig. 1A). Residues from HCDR1 and HCDR2, as well as residues located at the base of HCDR3, form a U-shaped depression containing HCDR1 TyrH33, HCDR2 AspH56 and HCDR3 HisH97 at its edges. These residues are conserved for all three antibodies and are accessible for forming polar interactions with the antigen. On the other side of the long HCDR3, the LCDR1 and LCDR3 loops extend towards the tip of HCDR3. This face of the paratope protrudes significantly by approximately 12 \u00c5 compared to the other side of the binding site. The open nature of the face made by the heavy chain CDRs suggests that it might be involved in interacting with a bulky and protruding component of the antigen, whereas the elongated properties of the second site suggests that it reaches into a specific site or cavity on the antigen. Altogether, the crystal structures of these antibodies illustrate that they are potentially capable of interacting with their gp120 antigen via two distinct recognition sites."

                        "Despite possessing highly similar structures, antibodies of the PGT121 family vary significantly in their sequences. Sequence identity in the heavy chain variable region between the three antibodies ranges between 74 and 78%, whereas sequence identity in the light chain variable region is on the order of 70\u201383% (Fig. 1C). Mapping of identical and dissimilar residues on the crystal structures of these antibodies identifies putative paratope regions that may have been maintained and optimized for antigen recognition. Indeed, CDRs H1, H2 and H3, which form the open face, are particularly well conserved across PGT121, 122 and 123 (conserved face 1, Fig. 1B). Another region with high conservation is the junction of LCDR3 and the tip of HCDR3 on the elongated face (conserved face 2, Fig. 1B). As expected, the electrostatic potential in these conserved regions of the paratope is also maintained in the three antibodies (Fig. S1). The significant degree of residue conservation in these regions suggests they are important in mediating broad HIV-1 neutralization."

                        "Based on the structure and sequence analysis described above, predicted key residues for antigen interaction were selected for all three antibodies in order to create alanine mutants for testing in HIV-1 pseudovirus neutralization assays. Mapping the effect of each mutation onto the crystal structures indicated that important paratope residues for HIV-1 neutralization map to highly conserved regions in the three antibodies (Fig. 2A). Two residues in the elongated conserved face 2 are critical for HIV-1 neutralization for all three antibodies: TyrH100B and GluH100I. The drastic effect of mutating either one of these two residues to alanine in PGT121, PGT122 and PGT123 is suggestive that this conserved portion of the paratope is the primary determinant for antigen contact, and, hence, for HIV-1 neutralization. Other residues in this face, such as ArgH100 and ArgL94, also play crucial roles in mediating HIV-1 neutralization for individual antibodies. In the open face, the alanine-scanning mutagenesis has more moderate effects, but key residues important for HIV-1 neutralization in this region include HCDR1 TyrH33, HCDR2 TyrH50 and AspH56, and LCDR3 TrpL96. We note that the PGT123 open face appears to play a more important role in mediating HIV-1 neutralization in these experiments, when compared to PGT121 and PGT122. Overall, the open face appears to represent a secondary site of interaction with the gp120 antigen."

                        "The PGT121 family of antibodies is sensitive to an N332A mutation on gp120 for recognition [5]. The N332 glycan is reported to be predominantly of the unprocessed high-mannose type [23], [25], [26], [29]. As such, members of the PGT121 family were tested for their binding properties on a glycan-array containing several types of glycans, including high-mannose sugars. Surprisingly, the PGT121 family showed almost no reactivity to high-mannose sugars on the glycan array in contrast to bnAbs of the PGT128 family [5]. The lack of high affinity binding to high-mannose sugars was further validated by the absence of any electron density corresponding to glycans upon co-crystallizing PGT123 Fab with Man9GlcNAc2 or by soaking PGT123 Fab crystals in a high concentration solution of Man9GlcNAc2 prior to X-ray diffraction experiments (data not shown). On the other hand, PGT121 interaction with a complex biantennary glycan could be observed on the glycan array and in the crystal structure (Fig. 2B and Figs. S2, S3). Fortuitously, the glycan observed in the PGT121 paratope comes from an N-linked glycan of a crystal symmetry-related PGT121 Fab molecule, as Fab PGT121 is glycosylated and was expressed in mammalian cells (Fig. S1A). This glycan sits directly in the open face of the PGT121 paratope and buries 530 \u00c52 of antibody surface area [31]. Such binding of PGT121 to a complex glycan from a symmetry-related molecule has also been described in another crystal system ([30] and Fig. S2).",
                        "Alanine-mutagenesis experiments in the PGT121 paratope were performed to show that the residues that contact the complex glycan in the crystal structure are indeed responsible for binding complex sugars on the glycan array (Fig. S3). These data indicate that PGT121 LysH53, which mediates two H-bonds to a galactose moiety of the biantennary complex glycan in the PGT121 crystal structure, confers complex glycan reactivity. Indeed, mutating this residue to an alanine completely abrogates binding to a complex glycan (Fig. S3D). In addition, PGT122 and PGT123 do not have a lysine at this position, but rather an Asp and a His, respectively, which might help to explain why these antibodies are not reactive with complex glycans on a glycan array. However, it appears that PGT121 reactivity with a complex sugar is not absolutely required for HIV-1 neutralization, since antibodies of the PGT121 family can neutralize viruses that were produced in the presence of kifunensine and, hence, lack complex sugars (Fig. S3B). This notion is consistent with the PGT121 interaction with the complex glycan in the crystal, as it has significant interactions with the core mannose residues that are a common feature of all N-linked glycans. Other interactions observed in the PGT121 crystal structure with specific glycan moieties of the complex biantennary might therefore not be essential for mediating HIV-1 neutralization."

                        "Despite isolating pure complexes of members of the PGT121 family with various gp120 constructs, we have not yet been able to obtain crystals that enable an atomic-level characterization of the epitope. Notwithstanding, negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) studies enabled characterization of the PGT122 epitope on the soluble HIV-1 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer [32], [33] at 15 \u00c5 resolution. The EM reconstruction allowed unequivocal identification of three PGT122 Fab molecules bound per recombinant HIV-1 trimer and elucidation of the binding site and mode of interaction. As the dimple in the Fab created by the separation of the variable and constant domains is clearly visible in negative-stain EM, it was possible to accurately place and correctly orient the PGT122 Fabs on gp120 by also using restraints that come from knowledge of the Fab elbow angle (133.2\u00b0 for PGT122 [34]) in the density fitting, as well as by using Protein G to identify and locate the CH1 domain of the Fab (Fig. S5). PGT122 interacts with the spike at an approximately 120\u00b0 angle in relation to the viral membrane surface if the Env trimer threefold axis is aligned perpendicular to the membrane (Fig. 3A). The EM reconstruction clearly reveals that the PGT122 epitope resides on the gp120 outer domain opposite to the CD4 binding site, which is consistent with the previous report that the N332 glycan at the base of the V3 loop is a crucial component for PGT121 family recognition [5]. Comparison of the SOSIP.664:PGT122 Fab reconstruction with our previous SOSIP.664:PGT128 Fab reconstruction [29] allowed identification of key differences between the recognition of these N332-dependent epitopes by these two classes of antibodies isolated from different donors (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the angle of approach to the recombinant Env trimer surface by these two antibodies is different. PGT128 Fab approaches at an angle slightly more parallel to the relatively flat apex of the recombinant Env trimer as opposed to a more vertical approach seen for PGT122 Fab. The PGT128 angle of approach leaves the apex exposed, where the V1/V2 loops are located [29]. On the other hand, PGT122 binding to the recombinant Env trimer partially masks elements of V1/V2 at the spike apex, which appears flat and resembles the closed conformation adopted by the unliganded trimer [35]. Steric clashes might therefore help explain the previously reported competition between PGT121 antibodies and PG9 [5]."

                        "It is well established that interaction of CD4 with HIV-1 Env causes conformational changes in the trimer leading to a more open conformation that exposes the co-receptor binding site [35]. While it was previously noted that CD4 binding site antibodies do not induce such conformational changes in the trimer, some CD4 binding site antibodies do induce conformational changes in recombinant gp120 [36]. To probe any potential conformational changes induced in HIV-1 Env on binding the PGT 121 family, sequential binding experiments were performed. First, binding of antibodies of the PGT121 family to JRFL gp120 monomeric constructs was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Figs. 4A and S6, S7) and resulted in binding affinities (Kd) of 83\u201395 nM (Table 2). When soluble CD4 (sCD4) was then titrated into the monomeric gp120 solution saturated with antibodies of the PGT121 family, binding of sCD4 to monomeric gp120 significantly decreased from a Kd of 21 nM in the absence of PGT121 antibodies to a Kd of \u223c10 \u00b5M in the presence of excess PGT121 antibodies (Figs. 4A and S6, S7 and Table 2). Together, these observations clearly indicate that antibodies of the PGT121 family compete with CD4 for binding to the gp120 monomer. In contrast, this competition was not observed for PGV04 Fab (Fig. 4A), which suggests that steric occlusion of the CD4 binding site is not the mechanism of competition utilized by antibodies of the PGT121 family. Interestingly, sCD4 competition was only observed in the context of a near full-length gp120 monomeric construct; deletions of elements of C1, V1/V2 and the V3 tip (gp120core+mV3) significantly decreased the binding affinity and did not result in sCD4 competition (Figs 4A and S6).",
                        "To confirm that such competition is also present on a recombinant HIV-1 trimer, the equivalent sequential ITC binding experiment was repeated with the soluble SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer. While sCD4 bound to the SOSIP.664 trimer with a Kd of 579 nM in the absence of PGT123 Fab, there was negligible binding in presence of PGT123 Fab (Fig. S7 and Table 2). PGT122 also competed with binding of the 337.8 Da CD4-like small molecule mimic NBD-556 in this system (Fig S8). Like sCD4, this molecule has been associated with inducing conformational changes in gp120 upon binding [37], [38], [39]. The reverse sequential binding experiment also revealed that PGT123 Fab was not able to bind SOSIP.664 trimer after pre-incubation with sCD4, despite binding the unliganded SOSIP.664 trimer with a Kd of 990 nM (Fig. S7 and Table 2). Therefore, the ITC experiments suggest the PGT121 antibody family must bind prior to receptor engagement by Env. Also noteworthy is the lower binding affinity of PGT123 Fab and sCD4 for the SOSIP.664 trimer, compared to the gp120 monomer (Table 2). One implication is that binding to the recombinant trimer is more constrained than to the monomer, as previously observed by others [40], [41], [42], [43]. However, we note that the gp120 that was used was from the JR-FL sequence, while the trimer was based on KNH1144. Additional studies with sequence-matched Env proteins, and possessing an identical glycosylation profile confirmed by mass spectrometry, will need to be performed to provide equivalent comparisons of binding to gp120 and soluble trimers.",
                        "Finally, to confirm the CD4-PGT121 competition in a more biologically relevant setting, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) experiments were performed. First, gp120-Fab complexes were purified by size-exclusion chromatography and the complexes were subsequently tested for their ability to bind CD4+ TZM-bl cells. As expected from the solution binding experiments, gp120-PGT121 antibody complexes were not able to significantly bind to the CD4 receptor on TZM-bl cells, whereas gp120-17b (co-receptor binding site antibody) and gp120-2G12 (N332-dependent antibody) complexes did bind to cell surface CD4 (Figs. 4B and S9A). Moreover, the ability of JRFL Env-expressing cells to interact with CD4 was investigated after pre-incubation with different Fabs with known epitopes. Antibodies of the PGT121 family interfered with CD4 binding to Env at the cell surface to a similar extent as b12 Fab, a CD4 binding site antibody (Fig. 4C and S9C). We note, however, that surprisingly high concentrations of Fabs were required to achieve CD4 competition, which did not reach 100% binding saturation (Figs. 4C and S9C). Whether this is specific to the assay or whether it is intrinsic to the mechanism of competition by these Fabs remains to be determined. On the other hand, 17b Fab binding increased the ability of Env-expressing cells to interact with CD4 in this assay (Fig. 4C), most likely due to favorable conformational changes induced in Env upon recognition by this co-receptor binding site antibody [44]. Steric occlusion was again ruled out as a competition mechanism since antibodies of the PGT121 family did not compete with the CD4 binding site bnAbs PGV04 and VRC01 for binding to cell-surface trimers (Figs. 4C and S9D). The FACS data, therefore, corroborate the ITC binding and TZM-bl binding results that illustrate how antibodies of the PGT121 family can compete with and prevent CD4 binding after their interaction with gp120. Because the PGT121 family epitope is significantly distant from the CD4 binding site as observed by electron microscopy (Fig. S8), a likely explanation for the observed inhibition of CD4 binding by antibodies of the PGT121 family is allosteric blockade of conformational rearrangements that are required for the gp120 components to adopt a conformation optimal for CD4 binding."

                "One key strategy guiding HIV-1 vaccine design has been the identification of sites of vulnerability on the Env protein via the characterization of epitopes recognized by broad and potent neutralizing antibodies. Here, we extensively characterize a new class of bnAbs, the PGT121 family, which was previously shown to neutralize approximately 70% of circulating HIV-1 isolates and recognizes an N332-dependent epitope on the gp120 outer domain [5]. Structural characterization of PGT122 Fab in complex with a recombinant HIV-1 Env trimer by electron microscopy reveals the location of the epitope and a novel angle of approach to the N332-dependent site of vulnerability on the gp120 outer domain for this family of antibodies. A combined approach of neutralization assays with antibody point mutants, and the fitting of high resolution crystal structures of individual components in the EM reconstruction, allow us to propose that the primary site for antibody recognition consists of the N332 glycan, and possibly another glycan, as well as protein-protein interactions near the base of the V3 loop (Fig. 5). Accordingly, previous alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies on gp120 revealed that, other than the glycosylation site at position N332 that was essential for Env recognition, other mutations that had moderate effects on JR-CSF neutralization by this class of antibodies were Asp325 and Ile326 (base of the V3 loop) [5]. In our proposed model, these residues at the base of the V3 loop are directly adjacent to critical paratope residues of the elongated face identified by alanine-scanning mutagenesis: ArgL94, TyrH100B and GluH100I. We propose that these residues form the primary and most critical site of epitope-paratope interactions. Other possible sites of interaction between the antibody and gp120 based on the EM model include gp120 strands \u03b219 and \u03b222. These strands are in close proximity to the V3 loop and lead into and emanate from the \u03b220 and \u03b221 strands that take part in forming the bridging sheet. In accordance with this hypothesis, Ile420 and Ile423 (\u03b219/\u03b220 strands) were also previously shown to have moderate effects on JR-CSF neutralization by antibodies of the PGT121 family [5].",
                "As revealed by the lack of binding on the glycan array, the affinity of antibodies of the PGT121 family for isolated high mannose glycans is relatively weak compared to other glycan-dependent anti-HIV-1 antibodies, such as bnAbs of the PGT128 family and 2G12 [29]. This apparent lack of binding on the array does not preclude the possibility that PGT121-like antibodies interact more strongly with glycans in the context of gp120, especially those surrounding the gp120 V3 base. As previously observed in the PGT128-gp120 outer domain crystal structure, as well as in the EM characterization of the PGT128 interaction with a recombinant SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer, the base of the V3 loop harbors two critical glycans at positions N301 and N332 [29]. Combining these data with our EM characterization of the PGT122-SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer interaction suggests putative interactions between antibodies of the PGT121 family and the N301 and N332 glycans. Our model predicts that the N301 and N332 glycans might be accommodated by elements of the light chain CDRs and at the interface between light chain CDRs and HCDR3, respectively (Fig. 5). This model is particularly attractive because it places the high mannose N332 glycan, on which HIV-1 neutralization by the PGT121 family relies heavily, as a central component of the epitope. Harder to interpret in the context of HIV-1 Env recognition, however, is the ability of PGT121 to interact with a complex biantennary glycan in glycan arrays and in crystal structures [30]. Modeling of the \u201cPGT121-liganded\u201d crystal structure in our EM density reveals that the complex glycan is adjacent to the N332 glycan. In this orientation in the model, the first N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) of the glycan emanates from density attributable to elements of gp120 V1/V2, for which little structural information is known in the context of gp120. Our model therefore suggests that the open face of the PGT121 antibody could possibly accommodate another glycan on gp120 in addition to the N332 glycan, potentially from the gp120 V1/V2 loops. Overall, the mode of gp120 protein-glycan recognition by the PGT121 antibody family might, therefore, in some ways resemble PG9 recognition of the gp120 V1/V2 domain. In this system, the elongated HCDR3 in PG9 penetrates the glycan coat to access a conserved polypeptide epitope comprising a cationic grove on gp120 V1/V2 that is juxtaposed to its surrounding glycans, facilitating paratope interactions with the glycans which enhance binding affinity [45]. Notably, only millimolar affinity was detected for PG9 carbohydrate binding alone [45].",
                "Because the gp120 CD4 binding site is on the opposite face of gp120 relative to the PGT122 epitope, the mechanism by which it effectively neutralizes HIV-1 infection remains unclear [29], [46]. Surprisingly, binding of PGT121 antibodies to their epitope interferes CD4 binding to gp120. The disruption of CD4 binding by PGT121 antibodies is observed in the context of recombinant monomeric gp120, recombinant trimeric gp140 and cell-surface Env trimers. Lack of competition with PGV04 and VRC01, but the presence of competition with CD4, is an argument against steric effects of PGT121 being the main cause of interference with CD4 binding to gp120. Combined with a relatively closed structure for the PGT122-SOSIP.664 trimer complex, these data lead us to suggest that the PGT121 antibody family effects HIV-1 neutralization by locking functional Env molecules in a conformation that prevents productive CD4 receptor engagement. However, simply binding to the high mannose patch bearing the N332-glycan might not be sufficient to confer such allosteric modulation of the CD4 binding site. Indeed, we show that in contrast to the PGT121 family, 2G12 fails to significantly prevent gp120 from binding CD4+ TZM-bl cells. These results agree with previous reports that show that 2G12 inhibits cell entry predominantly via competition with CCR5, although the effect of this antibody on CD4 binding to gp120 appears to vary in different assay systems [46], [47]. A recent report investigating the structure of unliganded gp120 monomers has suggested that C1 and the variable regions V1/V2 and V3 in gp120 might have profound effect in modulating the conformational changes associated with CD4 engagement [39]. Taken together with our observations, we suggest that antibodies, such as the PGT121 family, that involve protein elements of the V3 base in their epitope in addition to surrounding glycans, and perhaps with involvement of V1/V2, might constrain the Env trimer spikes and, hence, allosterically inhibit receptor binding, co-receptor binding and membrane fusion. We note that, in the cell-surface competition assays, the concentration at which CD4 competition is achieved appears higher than that required to achieve HIV-1 neutralization. Therefore, the physiological relevance to neutralization remains to be confirmed and other neutralization mechanisms might also be in play for this class of antibodies, such as induction of viral decay, for example [29]. Future studies will determine whether restraining the HIV-1 spike in a closed conformation is a major mechanism of neutralization and whether other bnAb families are also capable of preventing CD4 binding through an allosteric mechanism."

Briefly, the gp120 genes cloned adjacent to an IgK secretion signal in a phCMV3 plasmid were transfected in either HEK 293F cells or HEK 293S cells (GnT I-deficient) using 293Fectin (Invitrogen). The secreted gp120 monomer was recovered 6-days post-transfection and purified by GNL affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. A detailed protocol for the construction, expression and purification of the SOSIP.664 construct of Clade A KNH1144 sequence in HEK 293S GnT I-deficient cells can be found elsewhere [32], [33]. Briefly, following expression, the secreted SOSIP.664 construct was harvested from the supernatant and purified using a 2G12-coupled affinity matrix. SOSIP.664 of Clade A BG505 sequence with a T332N point mutation was used in EM experiments and was obtained using an identical protocol. sCD4 was expressed in bacteria as inclusion bodies, refolded and purified via nickel affinity using a protocol similar to that previously described [48].",
                        "PGT121 and 122 Fab were produced in 293T cells and secreted in the expression media as previously described [49]. To create the Fab fragment, the heavy chain IgG gene was first mutated by m-PIPE cloning to introduce a stop codon directly after the cysteine involved in the Fab heterodimer disulfide [50]. To obtain crystals with better diffracting properties, it was necessary to remove the glycosylation site on the PGT122 Fab by site-directed mutagenesis introducing an N to Q mutation. Subsequently, the heavy and light chain genes were co-transfected into HEK 293T cells. Three days after transfection, the expression media was harvested and purified via an anti-human \u03bb light chain affinity matrix (CaptureSelect Fab \u03bb; BAC), followed by cation exchange chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. PGT123 Fab was produced in Sf9 insect cells via baculovirus infection and secreted in the expression media as previously described [51]. Initially, a pFastBacDual (Invitrogen) plasmid was created that contained both the Fab heavy chain and light chain genes preceded by a gp67 secretion signal. Production of the bacmid and recombinant baculovirus was performed using the manufacturer's Bac-to-Bac TOPO Expression System protocol (Invitrogen). The supernatant of infected Sf9 cells was harvested 3 days after infection and the purification method was identical to that of the Fabs produced in mammalian cells. After purification, Fab fragments were concentrated to \u223c10 mg/mL and setup for crystallization trials using the automated CrystalMation robotic system (Rigaku) at the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (www.jcsg.org). X-ray diffraction quality crystals were obtained in the following conditions: PGT121 Fab: 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, 30% v/v PEG 400, 5% w/v PEG 3000, 10% v/v glycerol; PGT122 Fab: 0.1 M CAPS, pH 10.5, 0.2 M sodium chloride, 20% w/v PEG 8000; PGT123 Fab: 0.16 M zinc acetate, 0.08 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20% v/v glycerol, 20% w/v PEG 8K. For PGT122 Fab, the mother liquor was supplemented with 20% glycerol for cryo-protection. Full datasets for the PGT121, PGT122 and PGT123 crystals were collected at the SSRL 11-1 and APS 23-ID beamlines. Data processing was performed using XDS [52]. The structure for PGT123 Fab was solved in space group P21 using Fab coordinates PDB ID 3FN0 as a search model in PHASER [53]. Subsequently, the PGT121 and PGT122 structures were solved also using PHASER in space groups P212121 and C2, respectively with the PGT123 Fab structure as a search model. Refinement of the structures was performed using a combination of CNS [54], CCP4 [55], PHENIX [56] and COOT [57]. The final statistics for all Fab structures are reported in Table 1."
