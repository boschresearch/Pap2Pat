                        "Biofouling is a critical issue in membrane water and wastewater treatment as it greatly compromises the efficiency of the treatment processes. It is difficult to control, and significant economic resources have been dedicated to the development of effective biofouling monitoring and control strategies. Thermoplastic materials are conventionally used for preparation of polymer membranes. Two of the most widely used polymers in casting of polymer membranes are polysulfone (PSF) and polyethersulfone (PES), which are frequently employed because of their high mechanical strength and chemical stability. Despite high structural and chemical stability, the membranes made from thermoplastic polymers possess low porosity and high hydrophobicity that often results in severe membrane biofouling. Therefore, an increase in flux and hydrophilicity of polymeric membranes is highly desirable to minimize biofouling and increase their productivity and efficiency when used for long periods of time in water treatment systems.",
                        "In some instances, an additive may be used when casting the thermoplastic membranes in order to increase the porosity and flux of the membranes and provide antifouling properties for the membranes. Some conventionally used additives include polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) in a system of PSF/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, PSF/dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), polyethylene glycol in a polyvinylidene difluoride/dimethyl formamide (DMF), maleic acid in a system of cellulose acetate/dioxane, and glycerol in a system of PSF/DMAc.",
                        "Some of these additives help in producing membranes with more macro-voids, whereas others surpass the formation of macro-voids. Surpassing the formation of macro-voids results in the enhancement of the interconnectivity of pores and the formation of higher membrane porosities. PVP is commonly used due to its high solubility in water and good miscibility with PSF. However, it is known that PVP additive has opposite effects when used in casting solutions of PSF, as compared to PES, at least in terms of the formation of macro-pores or macro-voids."

                        "The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods of water treatment that minimize biofouling of a polymer membrane. More specifically, the present disclosure is directed to water treatment systems and methods utilizing a polymer membrane including Arabic gum in order to minimize biofouling and provide antimicrobial features.",
                        "Membrane fouling is a major problem encountered in membrane filtration processes, and it is a major factor in determining their practical application in water and wastewater treatment and desalination in terms of technology and economics. Membrane fouling includes inorganic fouling/scaling, organic fouling, particulate/colloidal fouling and biofouling (or microbial/biological fouling). Fouling due to organic and inorganic components and microorganisms can occur simultaneously, and these components may interact in terms of mechanism. Biofouling represents a limiting factor of the membrane process because microorganisms can multiply over time. For instance, even if 99.9% of them are removed, there are still enough cells remaining that can continue to grow at the expense of biodegradable substances in the feed water.",
                        "Biofouling can have several adverse effects on membrane water treatment systems. For instance, membrane flux may decline due to the formation of a low permeability biofilm on the membrane surface. An increased differential pressure and feed pressure may be needed to maintain the same production rate due to biofilm resistance. Membrane biodegradation may be caused by acidic by-products that are concentrated at the membrane surface. For example, cellulose acetate membrane has been found to be more susceptible to being biodegraded. Biofouling may also cause an increased salt passage through the membrane and a reduced quality of the product water due to the accumulation of dissolved ions in the biofilm at the membrane surface thus increasing the degree of concentration polarization. It may further cause increased energy consumption due to higher pressure being required to overcome the biofilm resistance and the flux decline.",
                        "Accordingly, the present disclosure provides for water treatment systems and methods that include a polymer membrane for minimizing biofouling more effectively than conventional polymer membranes, in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the water treatment systems and methods. FIG. 1 illustrates a cross-section of an example water treatment system 100, according to one aspect of the present disclosure. The example system 100 includes a water tank 110 that includes an inlet 120 and an outlet 130. The inlet 120 and the outlet 130 are in fluid communication with one another such that a fluid may flow into the water tank 110 at the inlet 120 and out of the water tank 110 at the outlet 130. The water tank 110 may be any suitable housing for directing a water stream 150 from the inlet 120 to the outlet 130. The inlet 120 and the outlet 130 may have any suitable design for directing water or other fluid into and out of the water tank 110, respectively, and may be connected to piping, hosing, or other means for transporting water or other fluid. For example, the inlet 120 and outlet 130 may extend from the water tank 110 as illustrated in FIG. 1, or in other examples, may be openings on the ends of the water tank 110 that do not extend outward. In such other examples, the water tank 110, rather than the inlet 120 and outlet 130, may be connected to piping, hosing, or other means for transporting water or other fluid.",
                        "The example system 100 also includes a polymer membrane 140 contained within the water tank 110. The polymer membrane 140 is additionally in fluid communication with the inlet 120 and the outlet 130. In various examples, the polymer membrane 140 extends to the outer perimeter of the water tank 110 interior such that untreated water entering at the inlet 120 must pass through the polymer membrane 140 prior to exiting at the outlet 130. Accordingly, the water stream 150 may enter the water tank 110 at the inlet 120 in the direction of the illustrated arrow as untreated water, pass through the polymer membrane 140 in the direction of the illustrated arrow to be treated, and the treated water stream 160 may exit the water tank 110 at the outlet 130 in the direction of the illustrated arrow. The water stream 150, in various examples, may be sewage, seawater, ground water, or other suitable water for treatment. Treating the water, in some instances, may include removing a fungus, a virus, a protozoa, or other contaminants from the water.",
                        "The polymer membrane 140 includes Arabic gum and at least one polymer. Arabic gum, also known as gum Arabic or acacia gum among other names, is a natural, complex polysaccharide consisting of the hardened sap of various species of the acacia tree, and has been found, based on this disclosure, to provide antimicrobial properties suitable for water treatment. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the membrane 140 may include PSF mixed or blended with Arabic gum. In other aspects of the present disclosure, the membrane 140 may include Arabic gum mixed or blended with other polymers, such as cellulose acetate, polyamide, polyvinylidene fluoride, PES, polyvinyl chloride, polyimide, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl alcohol, poly(methacrylic acid), poly(arylene ether ketone), poly(ether imide), and polyaniline.",
                        "In various aspects, the polymer membrane includes between 0.1% to 7% by weight of Arabic gum. For example, the polymer membrane may include 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 or 7 wt % Arabic gum. In other examples, the polymer membrane may include more or less Arabic gum. The addition of Arabic gum to the polymer membrane 140 helps limit biofouling of the polymer membrane 140. In some instances, the polymer membrane 140 may advantageously reduce biofouling against bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, isolate of Salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria that cause biofouling. Accordingly, the example water system 100 may have increased efficiency due to the reduction of biofouling of the polymer membrane 140 because of the inclusion of Arabic gum in the polymer membrane 140.",
                        "Escherichia coli is a member of a group of organisms known as coliforms: common bacteria found in the digestive system of humans and animals. One strain of E. coli is responsible for causing Traveler's diarrhea, and another strain, E. coli O157:H7, contaminates meat and leafy vegetables. Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria that causes a wide variety of clinical manifestations. This bacteria is considered to be a major pathogen that colonizes and infects both hospitalized patients with decreased immunity, and healthy immuno-competent people. Staphylococcus. aureus is found in the environment and is also found in normal human flora, located on the skin and mucous membranes.",
                        "Klebsiella pneumonia is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes nosocomial, urinary tract, and wound infections. It can be found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines. Salmonella is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Salmonella constitutes a genus of zoonotic bacteria of worldwide economic and health importance. The majority of human infection of Salmonella is related to the ingestion of contaminated foods such as poultry, beef, pork, egg etc. Salmonella is frequently detected in surface waters including recreational waters and waters used for irrigation or as a drinking water source. The Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa has become an important cause of infection such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, especially in patients with compromised host defense mechanisms. It is the most common pathogen isolated from patients who have been hospitalized longer than 1 week.",
                        "FIG. 2 illustrates an example method 200 for treating water, according to an aspect of the present disclosure. Although the examples below are described with reference to the flowchart illustrated in FIG. 2, many other methods of performing the acts associated with FIG. 2 may be used. For example, the order of some of the blocks may be changed, certain blocks may be combined with other blocks, one or more of the blocks may be repeated, and some of the blocks described may be optional. At step 202, the method 200 includes providing a polymer membrane that includes Arabic gum (e.g., the polymer membrane 140). At step 204, an untreated water stream is provided. The untreated water stream may be, for example, sewage, seawater, ground water, or other suitable water for treatment. At step 206, the water stream is treated by being directed though the polymer membrane that includes Arabic gum (e.g., the polymer membrane 140). Treating the water, in some instances, may include removing a fungus, a virus, a protozoa, or other contaminants from the water. Accordingly, the example water treatment method 200 may have increased efficiency due to the reduction of biofouling of the polymer membrane that includes Arabic gum because of the inclusion of Arabic gum in the polymer membrane.",
                        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of PSF membranes incorporated with Arabic gum at reducing biofouling, various experiments were performed. PSF membranes incorporated with Arabic gum were cast via a phase inversion method using a flat sheet membrane casting system, such as the one manufactured by Philos Co., Ltd of South Korea. The membrane samples were prepared with different concentrations of Arabic gum, specifically: 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 7 wt % in a homogeneous (dope) 16 wt % PSF/DMAc solution. For the preparation of the casting solutions, DMAc, PSF and Arabic gum were sonicated using a probe ultra-sonicator, such as the one manufactured by Cole Parmer of USA, and mixed using an IKA Ultra Turrax T25 digital mechanical stirrer, such as the one manufactured by IKA of USA, for about two hours at a temperature of 60\u00b0 C. to ensure that the PSF and the Arabic gum dissolved in the solvent. The resultant solution was then degassed for about six hours and cast onto a clean glass plate using a casting knife with a gap height of 200 \u03bcm at a casting speed of 2.5 m/min at room temperature. The glass plate with the cast membrane film was immersed in distilled water and kept until the membrane was detached from the glass plate. The membranes were then washed and kept in distilled water for 24 hours at room temperature to remove traces of the solvent. For comparison, membrane samples with PVP (5 wt % in the dope solution) were also cast under the same conditions.",
                        "The antimicrobial properties of the membranes were evaluated using Staphylococcus aureus as a model of Gram-positive bacteria and four strains of Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a Salmonella isolate. The bacterial suspensions were prepared from an 18-hours-old nutrient broth culture from the above-motioned bacteria. The bacterial cell density was measured at an optical density (OD) of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. The membranes prepared in the laboratory as well as the commercial membranes were disinfected by 70% ethanol and then dipped in sterilized water, dried in a laminar flow hood, and immersed 10 min in the bacterial suspension adjusted at 2.4\u00d7107 CFU/ml by dilution in a nutrient broth. Using sterile tweezers, the membranes were gently placed on nutrient agar plates and placed in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 hours. After incubation, the membranes were placed gently on new sterilized petri dishes and then fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in a phosphate buffered saline buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed twice in the phosphate buffer solution and then dried in a laminar flow hood. All the samples were sputtered with gold before scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurement.",
                        "FIGS. 3a to 3e illustrate SEM images of the membrane surfaces after the incubation with the five different bacterial suspensions. The images in the left column illustrate a PSF membrane with 7 wt % Arabic gum, whereas the images in the right column illustrate conventional PSF membranes without Arabic gum. The images in FIG. 3a correspond to the membranes incubated with Escherichia coli. The images in FIG. 3b correspond to the membranes incubated with Klebsiella pneumonia. The images in FIG. 3c correspond to the membranes incubated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The images in FIG. 3d correspond to the membranes incubated with the Salmonella isolate. The images in FIG. 3e correspond to the membranes incubated with Staphylococcus aureus.",
                        "The addition of Arabic gum to the casting solutions enhanced the PSF membrane antimicrobial properties. For instance, each of the surface images in FIGS. 3a to 3e of the conventional PSF membranes without Arabic gum in the column on the right illustrate a greater amount of bacteria than the respective image of the PSF membrane with 7 wt % Arabic gum in the column on the left. Therefore, the addition of Arabic gum prevented bacteria from growing on the surface of a membrane to a greater degree than membranes without Arabic gum. Accordingly, PSF membranes with Arabic gum minimize biofouling of the membranes as compared to PSF membranes without Arabic gum.",
