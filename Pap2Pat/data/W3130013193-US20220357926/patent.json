    "abstract": "A quantum random number generator is provided that can generate more secure random numbers in consideration of at least one of imperfection of quantum bits or imperfection of a projective measurement equipment. In this generator, the functional configuration of a random number extractor differs from a conventional configuration, and the random number extractor acquires a probability distribution of measurement expectation values from information of a random number sequence for measurement basis selection used in the equipment, and at least one of information of imperfection of the equipment measured in advance, or information of imperfection of a quantum bit generator. Then, an estimation probability is calculated by using the probability distribution of the measurement expectation values, and a measurement result in a binary bit string output from the equipment is compressed by the calculated estimation probability to extract a secure random number.",

                        "A quantum random number generator is conventionally generally configured with a quantum bit generator, a projective measurement equipment, and a random number extractor. Of these, the quantum bit generator continuously generates at least N bits of N (where N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2) quantum bits to be in two quantum superposition states. Here, when the two quantum states are denoted as |0> and |1>, the quantum bits generated from the quantum bit generator are represented by \u03b1|0>+\u03b2|1> (where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are coefficients, and satisfy a relationship \u03b12+\u03b22=1).",
                        "The projective measurement equipment measures the quantum bits generated by the quantum bit generator by using one randomly selected basis of two non-orthogonal bases M1 and M2 as information of a random number sequence for random measurement basis selection. For example, in a case of polarization quantum bits, the measurement using two non-orthogonal bases corresponds to a determination measurement of \u00b145 degree linear polarization or a determination measurement of vertical and horizontal polarization. N bits of random number sequence Z (vector quantity)=(Z1, Z2, . . . , ZN) for measurement specification selection is input into the projective measurement equipment, in addition to the input of the N bits of quantum bits generated by the quantum bit generator. Here, Zi (i=1 to N: where N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2) is any random number that can take any of a binary value of 0 or 1, for example, and is a random variable.",
                        "In the projective measurement equipment, a projective measurement is performed on the input i-th quantum bit by using a basis corresponding to the random number Zi. For example, the projective measurement equipment measures the quantum bits by the basis M1 when the random number Zi=0 and measures the quantum bits by the basis M2 when the random number Zi=1. The random number sequence Z is used to randomly select a basis for measuring a certain quantum bit. In other words, in the projective measurement equipment, all of the N bits of quantum bits are measured by a basis corresponding to the random number sequence Z to obtain a measurement result C (vector quantity)=(C1, C2, . . . , CN) with N bits of binary bit string. Here, Ci (i=1 to N) is a measurement result for any i-th quantum bit, and is a classical random variable to which information of either 0 or 1 of bits.",
                        "The random number extractor compresses the measurement result C including the N bits of binary bit string to extract secure random numbers by using an overall estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) estimated by an eavesdropper capable of arbitrarily quantum operation and outputs a random number sequence R according to the generation of the secure random numbers. In this regard, C, Z, and R described herein denote vector quantities. For the compression, a case of using a hash function such that its length is \u2212log 2 (Pg (C|Z; E=e)) can be exemplified. Here, arbitrarily quantum operation indicates trying to read information even in part by using any eavesdropping method that is possible through quantum mechanics. The secure random numbers indicate that randomness is quantum-mechanically guaranteed. The estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) indicates a probability that the eavesdropper can hit the measurement result C somehow. In other words, the estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) can be said to be the probability that the eavesdropper can avoid uncertainty by performing arbitrarily quantum operation.",

In this way, it is possible to generate and output a random number sequence R according to a random number with which the randomness is quantum-mechanically guaranteed.",

Here, E=e means that the eavesdropper (E) can perform any eavesdropping e that is physically possible. Note that each of C and Z according to the estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) is vector quantity.",
                        "NPL 2 focuses on obtaining a function of the estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) for each measurement and a function form F (C, Z) of a probability estimation coefficient with a positive value which is a function for C and Z. Here, each of C and Z according to the estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) for each measurement is scalar quantity. The estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) is equal to maxp (C|Z) targeting C and Z of a normal conditional probability p (C|Z) for obtaining the measurement result C at a Z basis.",

Here, each of C and Z according to the overall estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) in this case is vector quantity. Note that the function form F (C, Z) is referred to below as a probability estimation coefficient function, but is regarded as an auxiliary function for determining the normal conditional probability p (C|Z).",

FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram illustrating a basic configuration of a quantum random number generator 10A according to a comparative example.",
                        "Referring to FIG. 1, the quantum random number generator 10A includes a quantum bit generator 1, a projective measurement equipment 2, and a random number extractor 3. The quantum bit generator 1 generates N (a plurality of) quantum bits B with photons. The projective measurement equipment 2 outputs a measurement result C in a binary bit string that is projection measured by using information of a random number sequence Z for random measurement basis selection of the N quantum bits B generated by the quantum bit generator 1. The random number extractor 3 compresses the measurement result C in the binary bit string to extract random numbers by using an estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) for estimation by an eavesdropper capable of arbitrarily quantum operation and outputs a random number sequence R. Note that C and Z related to the estimation probability Pg (C|Z; E=e) are vector quantities. The basic functions of these parts are as described in the section of background.",
                        "The principles of the detail functions of each part are described below. In the projective measurement equipment 2, estimation values of the Pauli matrix \u03c3 are given as (\u03c3X, \u03c3Y, \u03c3Z), and operators indicating two non-orthogonal measurements are given as the bases M1, and M2. The basis M1 represents a value obtained by multiplying a vector quantity of the Pauli matrix \u03c3 by a vector quantity of \u03b71, and the basis M2 represents a value obtained by multiplying the vector quantity of the Pauli matrix \u03c3 by a vector quantity of \u03b72. Here, an angle between the vector quantity of \u03b71 and the vector quantity of \u03b72 on the Bloch sphere is \u03b8. In a case of ideal measurements, the angle \u03b8 is \u03b8=\u03c0/2. At this time, for expectation values <M1> and <M2> obtained by the measurement of the bases M1 and M2, a relationship is satisfied in which the value obtained by adding a value of [<M1>\u2212<M2>]2/(2\u22122 cos \u03b8) to a value of [<M1>+<M2>]2/(2+2 cos \u03b8) is less than or equal to 1. This relationship gives the greatest possible range of the measurement results C due to the axial displacement of the projection axis of the bases M1 and M2. Note that the bases M1 and M2 used in the projective measurement equipment 2 may be referred to as measurement bases because the bases are for projection measurement.",
                        "The bases M1 and M2 used in the projective measurement equipment 2, in a case of quantum bits, normally sets two states when determining in which of two orthogonal states the input quantum state is in a three-dimensional space. This can be said to determine whether the quantum state to be measured, which is any of the vector quantities orthogonal to each other in the three-dimensional space, is a vector quantity along the X-axis direction, or a vector quantity along the Y-axis direction. The axial displacement indicates that the vector quantity is slightly offset from the ideal vector quantity in the X-axis direction or the vector quantity in the Y-axis direction.",
                        "FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the relationship between the axial displacement of bases M1 and M2, which may occur in the projective measurement equipment 2 provided in the quantum random number generator 10A, and a maximum possible range of the expectation values <M1> and <M2> depending on the probability of multiphoton generation. Note that, in FIG. 2, in the relationship of the expectation value <M2> of the basis M2 of the vertical axis with respect to the expectation value <M1> of the basis M1 of the horizontal axis, a displacement angle S from the angle \u03b8=\u03c0/2 and a probability \u03b5m where two or more photons are contained in one pulse are assumed, and the various characteristics are displayed in substantially circular shapes. The characteristic of the innermost circumference C1 is of a case of \u03b4=0 degrees and \u03b5m=0. The characteristic C2 outside the characteristic C1 is of a case of \u03b4=0 degrees and \u03b5m=0.05. The characteristic C3 outside the characteristic C2 is of a case of \u03b4=5 degrees and \u03b5m=0.

The splitter 26A splits input light into two optical paths. One of the light split at the splitter 26A is reflected to be incident on the delayer 28 by the reflection mirror 27A. Light that has been incident on the delayer 28 and transmitted is reflected at the reflection mirror 27B so as to be incident on the combiner 26B. The combiner 26B combines the other light split at the splitter 26A and the reflected light reflected by the reflection mirror 27B. Two output ports of the combiner 26B (which are regarded as two output ports of the delayed optical interferometer) are connected with the single photon detector A23 and the single photon detector B24.",

The delayer 28 is provided on the side of the reflection mirror 27A of one optical path split by the splitter 26A. The delayer 28 is input with a random number sequence Z for the measurement basis selection, and acquires a phase difference \u03c6 between phases corresponding to the two optical paths split at the splitter 26A, which are time intervals of the pulses 1 and 2 that constitute time position quantum bits. The phase difference \u03c6 of the delayer 28 is exactly \u03c6+2n\u03c0, but here 2n\u03c0 is omitted.",

The time slots are referred to as slots 1, 2, and 3 in an earlier order. When a photon is detected in the slot 1, the photon that was originally in the pulse 1 would only follow the shorter path of the delayed optical interferometer (the path without the delayer 28). Thus, the state of the input photon is |1>. In other words, it is assumed that the photon has been projected to the state |1>.",

In other words, when a photon is detected in any of the slots 1 and 3, it can be considered that the basis M1 described above is selected. For such a basis M1, there is no meaning in which of the single photon detector A23 or the single photon detector B24 the photon is detected. Processing contents for assigning the detected slot to +1 when detected in the slot 1 and assigning the detected slot to \u22121 when detected in the slot 3 as a result, for example, are important.",

In such cases, it is assumed that interference of single photons will occur due to the wave nature of photons.",

In the projective measurement equipment 20B, a binary bit string of the measurement result Ci that is +1 is obtained when a result of the quantum state |1> is obtained, and a binary bit string of the measurement result Ci that is \u22121 is obtained when a result of the quantum state |2> is obtained by the projection measurement of the basis M1. Note that the waveform of the processing signal in FIG. 7 is illustrated in relation to the energy basis of the vertical axis relative to the time basis of the horizontal axis. Note that the energy basis |E> is a value obtained by (|1>+exp (\u2212i\u03c6) |2>)/20.5.",

In the projective measurement equipment 20B, such projection measurements can be performed for each of the N time position quantum bits to obtain the measurement results C (=C1, C2, . . . , CN) by the binary bit string.",

In contrast, in the projective measurement equipment 20B for measuring the time position quantum bits according to the third embodiment, the two bases M1 and M2 are automatically randomly selected by the splitter 26A that constitutes the delayed optical interferometer. As a result, there is an advantage that mounting is simplified.",

The method of generating quantum random numbers basically includes a projection measurement step and a random number sequence output step.",

This is in accordance with the basic function of the random number extractor 30 described above.",
                                "Furthermore, in the random number sequence output step, the random number extractor acquires the probability distribution of the measurement expectation values from the information of the random number sequence Z and at least one of the information PZ of the imperfection of the projective measurement equipment 2 measured in advance or the information PB of the imperfection of the quantum bit generator 1. Then, the estimation probability is calculated by using the probability distribution of the obtained measurement expectation values, and the measurement result C is compressed with the calculated estimation probability to output a more secure random number sequence RI.

It is preferable to obtain a probability distribution of measurement expectation values from these pieces of information.
