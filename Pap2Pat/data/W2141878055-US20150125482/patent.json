The inventive polypeptides or epitopes can be utilized in assays to evaluate candidate vaccines to malaria.

                        "Malaria is caused by the vector borne organism Plasmodium spp. The parasite has a complex lifecycle involving stage specific expression of proteins. These proteins can be expressed at different stages or be specific to stages. Malaria is an extremely important disease, with over 3 billion people living in malaria endemic areas. Over 1 million deaths are attributable to malaria per year. The emergence of drug resistant strains has compounded the problem of treating the disease. Unfortunately, no FDA-approved vaccine exists.",
                        "The entire genomic sequence of P. falciparum has been sequenced (Bowman et al., Nature, 400: 532-538 (1999), Gardner, et al., Nature, 419: 498-511 (2002)). The rodent malaria parasite, P. yoelii has also been sequenced (Carlton et al., Nature, 419: 512-519 (2002)). Despite this, however, the development of efficacious anti-malaria vaccines has been severely hampered by the paucity of promising antigens. As such, no FDA-approved vaccine to this agent exists.",
                        "Sterile protective immunity to malaria induced by experimental immunization with irradiated sporozoites is thought to be mediated by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells directed against malaria antigens expressed on the surface of infected hepatocytes and perhaps anti-sporozoite antibodies (Agnandji, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 365: 1863-75 (2011)). Naturally acquired anti-malarial immunity is mediated primarily by antibodies to blood-stage parasites with T cell responses possibly providing a contribution. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are needed for optimal effector cell functions. Furthermore, the development of immunological memory (Beeson, et al., Trends Parasitol 24: 578-584 (2008) and T cell responses is known to be genetically restricted.",
                        "The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the main antigenic component of the RTS,S vaccine that has demonstrated \u224850% efficacy in Phase 3 trials in Sub-Saharan Africa (Agnandji, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 365: 1863-75 (2011)). While RTS,S induces anti-CSP antibodies and CD4+ T cell responses thought to be associated with protection (Moorthy and ballou, Malar J., 8: 312 (2009)), CD8+ T cell responses to CSP have not been consistently demonstrated in RTS,S vaccinated individuals (Moorthy and ballou, Malar J., 8: 312 (2009)), which may limit its ability to target the liver stage of Plasmodium. It has been suggested that vaccine strategies promoting the induction of CD8+ T cell responses to RTS,S, such as priming with adenovirus vectored vaccines, might improve protection."

In one embodiment, one or more polypeptides can be included in immunogenic composition against malaria. In this embodiment, one or more proteins can be produced by first inserting the DNA encoding the proteins in suitable expression systems. The expressed and purified proteins can then be administered in one or multiple doses to a mammal, such as humans. In this embodiment, the purified proteins can be expressed individually or DNA encoding specific proteins can be recombinantly associated to form a single immunogenic composition. These immunogenic compositions can then be administered in one or multiple doses to induce an immunogenic response.",

                        "In order to develop anti-malaria vaccines that stimulate an enhanced cell mediated response, it is important for the vaccine to contain appropriate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes. CD8+ T cell responses that produce IFN-\u03b3 and multifunctional responses (i.e., produce more than 2 cytokines) have been associated with protection in other diseases (Darrah, et al., Nat Med., 13: 843-50 (2007); Seder, et al., Nat Rev Immunol., 8: 247-58 (2008); Lindenstrom, et al., J.

Immun., 74: 2706-16 (2006); Karanam, et al., Vaccine 27: 1040-9 (2009)). For this reason, it is important develop immunogenic candidates that contain T-cell epitopes.",
                        "In a preferred embodiment, polypeptides of specific regions of the P. falciparum CSP were identified and isolated, which contain CD8+ T cell epitopes. Because of the importance of CD8+ T-cells in conferring immunity to malaria, these polypeptides are useful as components of immunogenic compositions against malaria.",
                        "There are many hundreds of HLA A and B alleles that can be classified into 12 Class I super-types that cover most of the known HLA-A and HLA-B polymorphisms, permitting identification of potential peptide binding motifs that should recognize the super-types (Sette, A. and J. Sidney, Immunogenetics 50: 201-12 (1999)). Algorithms have been developed to aid prediction of peptide sequences that bind to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Gowthaman, U. and J. N. Agrewala, Expert Rev Proteomics 6: 527-37 (2009); Tian, et al., Amino Acids 36: 535-54 (2009); Hattotuwagama, et al., Methods Mol Biol. 409: 227-45 (2007)).",

These are restricted by five HLA-A and two HLA B supertypes that together are expressed by 99.5% of Caucasians and 98.1% African Americans Sette and Sidney, Immunogenetics, 50: 201-12 (1999)). In addition, CSP class I epitopes have been shown to be degenerate and are recognized by multiple HLA alleles (Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997)), and we found similar degeneracy in this study. Therefore it is likely that these adenovectored CSP vaccines will elicit CD8+ T cell responses in a genetically diverse population. The CSP epitopes identified herein can form part of an epitope based vaccine against malaria."

In this context, the term identity refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same, when aligned for maximum correspondence. Where sequences differ in conservative substitutions, i.e., substitution of residues with identical properties, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution.",
                        "CD4+ and CD8+, HLA-restricted T cells are needed for optimal effector cell functions. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that malaria vaccines contain appropriate HLA-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes that are recognized by as wide a population as possible. Secondly, identification of such epitopes that can be combined into a single pool for stimulating PBMC has the potential to facilitate the determination of immunogenicity of candidate malaria vaccines where cell numbers can are limited.",
                        "In order to develop anti-malaria vaccines that stimulate an enhanced cell mediated response, it is important to map the HLA-restricted T-cell epitopes of potentially important malarial antigens, such as CSP. CD8+ T cell responses that produce IFN-\u03b3 and multifunctional responses (i.e., produce more than 2 cytokines) have been associated with protection in other diseases (Darrah, et al., Nat Med., 13: 843-50 (2007); Seder, et al., Nat Rev Immunol., 8: 247-58 (2008); Lindenstrom, et al., J.

For this reason, it is important development of immunogenic candidates containing T-cell epitopes, especially, CD8+ epitopes.",

                        "The computerized algorithm NetMHC (Nielsen, et al., Protein Sci., 12: 1007-1017 (2003)) was used to predict the binding affinities of 8-10 mer peptides contained within overlapping 15 mer peptides of CSP.",
                        "CSP has three distinct regions: the N-terminal region containing the conserved region I sequence; the central repeat region; and the C-terminal region containing the thrombospondin-like type I repeat (TSR) that functions in hepatocyte invasion (Coppi, et al, J. Exp. Med. 208: 341-56 (2011)) RTS,S contains part of the central repeat and the C-terminal region, but recent studies have demonstrated that antibodies associated with protection also recognize epitopes in the N-terminal region Bongfen, et al., Vaccine, 27: 328-35 (2009)), not present in RTS,S. The regions of CSP that might lead to effective targeting by CD8+ T cells have not yet been functionally defined.",
                        "Therefore, it was important to next identify class I-restricted epitopes within CSP. Previous studies using peptides have identified a series of DR-restricted (Doolan, et al., J. Immunol., 165: 1123-37 (2000); Lockyer, et al., Mol. Biochem. Parasitol, 37: 275-80 (1989); Jalloh, et al., Malar J., 8: 120 (2009); Nardin, et al., J. Immunol., 166: 481-9 (2001); Calvo-Calle, et al., J. Immunol. 159: 1362-73 (1997); Kumar, et al., Nature, 344: 258-60 (1988); Good, et al., PNAS (USA), 85: 1199-203 (1988)) and CD8+-restricted epitopes in the N- and C-terminal regions of CSP (Hill, et al., Nature, 360: 434-9 (1992); Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997); Blum-Tirouvanziam, et al., J. Immunol., 154: 3922-31 (1995); Aidoo, et al., Lancet, 345: 1003-7 (1995); Wang, et al., Science, 282: 476-80 (1998)). Class II-restricted epitopes are promiscuous, binding to multiple alleles (Panina-Bordignon, et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 19: 2237-42 (1989)), including epitopes in malaria antigens, such as the DR-restricted epitopes in CSP (Doolan, et al., J. Immunol., 165: 1123-37 (2000). Promiscuity in class I-restricted epitopes has also been described for malaria antigens including CSP (Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997)) and has been extended to include epitopes from other organisms (Frahm, et al., J. Virol, 78: 2187-200 (2004); Frahm, et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 37: 2419-33 (2007)).",
                        "Similarities in binding motifs among HLA class I alleles has allowed clustering into nine supertypes (Sidney, et al., J. Immunol, 154: 247-59 (1995); Lund, et al., Immunogenetics, 55: 797-810 (2004); Sette and Sidney, Immunogenetics, 50: 201-12 (1999)). Based on algorithms that predict binding to MHC molecules, measured as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values expressed in nM (Sette, et al., J. Immunol., 153: 5586-92 (1994)), a meta-analysis using an affinity cut off of 500 nM predicted that 52% of a panel P. falciparum peptides bound to HLA A*0201 (Doolan, et al., PNAS (USA), 100: 9952-7 (2003)), and led to the development of publically available algorithms that are specific for class I and class II types (Doolan, et al., PNAS (USA), 100: 9952-7 (2003)). The outcomes of these and similar studies has led to the establishment of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) that contains data and analytical tools from a wide range of organisms including malaria (Vaughn, et al., Parasite Immunolo., 31: 78-97 (2009)). Recently, analysis of the IEDB data base suggests that >50% of HLA class I-restricted ligands bind to two or more HLA molecules often spanning different supertypes (Rao, et al., Immunogenetics, 63: 691-701 (2011). Since CD8+ T cell responses appear crucial in targeting the intracellular hepatic stage, we decided to further characterize CD8+ T cell responses in these immunized volunteers by mapping CSP class I-restricted epitopes.",

We have previously used a combination of peptide-based mapping and the computer-based algorithm NetMHC (Nielsen, et al., Protein Sci., 12: 1007-17 (2003)) to identify class I epitopes in AMA1 (Sedegah, et al., Malar, J., 9: 241 (2011)), and adopted a similar approach here.",
                        "Peptide pools containing overlapping 15mer peptides that showed positive responses in ELISpot assays with volunteers immunized with these CSP vaccines were analyzed using NetMHC to predict putative CD8+-restricted epitopes within active 15mers. A subset of the predicted epitopes was synthesized, and ELISpot assays were used to confirm recall responses by stimulating PBMC from the immunized volunteers with these minimal epitopes. CD8+ T cell responses were demonstrated by flow cytometry and CD8+ T cell-dependence by ELISpot depletion studies. PBMCs were sufficient to confirm eleven of the novel CD8+ T cell dependent epitopes, of which six were from the N-terminal and five were from the C-terminal regions. Finally, we identified evidence to support the concept of class I-restricted epitope promiscuity.",

This vaccine was evaluated in three different clinical trials. In the first trial, six volunteers were immunized with 2\u00d71010 pu of both adenovectors (Ad-CA) as a single dose into the deltoid muscle by needle injection, and six different volunteers received a five-fold higher dose (Sedegah, et al., PLoS One, 6: e24586 (2011). In the second trial, 11 volunteers were immunized twice with 1\u00d71010 pu of the Ad5 P. falciparum CSP vaccine alone (Ad-C) with a 16 week interval; these volunteers were challenged by bite of P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes 28 days after the second vaccine dose (Tamminga, et al., PLoS One, 6: e25868 (2011). In the third trial, 17 volunteers were immunized once with 2\u00d71010 pu of both adenovectors (Ad-CA) and were challenged by bite of P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. None of the volunteers in the two challenge studies was sterilely protected against malaria. However, the vaccines were strongly immunogenic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. A limited supply of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) remaining after the primary analysis of immunogenicity for the various trials were used for epitope mapping."

Four of these pools (Cp1, Cp2, Cp6, and Cp9) containing 26 peptides elicited ELISpot responses among the volunteers who received Ad-CA defined as greater than 33% of the activity of the highest response to one of the pools, and thus were considered immunodominant (Sedegah, et al., PLoS One 6: e24586 (2011)).

Depending on availability of cells, each PBMC sample was assayed in duplicate, triplicate, or quadruplicate and the number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting spot forming cells (sfc) was counted using an automated ELISpot reader (AID, GmbH, Germany). In duplicate assays, all values were used in analysis. For triplicate or quadruplicate assays, outliers were rejected if any single value contributed more than 50% of the standard deviation of the replicates and if its value was three-fold greater or three-fold less than the average of the remaining two (or three) values. The mean number of sfcs obtained in negative control wells was subtracted from the value of each test well from the same sample. Negative counts generated by this background subtraction were converted to zero. The mean number of spots of the test sample was then calculated and expressed as spot forming cells/million (sfc/m). A positive response was defined as a significant difference (p=<0.05) between average of the number of spot forming cells (sfc) in test wells and the average of negative control wells (Student's two tailed t-test), and at least a doubling of sfc in test wells relative to negative control wells, and a difference of at least ten sfc between test and negative control wells (Sedegah, et al., PLoS One, 6: e24586 (2011)).",

Fifteen of the 26 tested 15mers were positive by ELISpot: four from Cp1, four from Cp2, two from Cp6, and five from Cp9. The results are illustrated in Table 2.

Five predicted putative epitopes were selected that matched the HLA alleles expressed by volunteers from whom we had sufficient cells. These were E1, E2, E3, E13, and E17. In addition, five new epitopes were synthesized that were predicted by NetMHC to match the volunteers, for which PBMC was available, but were not identified in the original epitope analysis using 15mer peptides, as in Table 3. These were numbered E17a (as it is contained within E17), E18, E19, E20 and E21. Nine of the 17 volunteers listed in Table 1 were used in these assays and had been immunized with Ad-CA or Ad-C.",

In some assays epitopes that were not predicted to bind to that volunteer were also tested. Each synthesized predicted epitope was tested with the original peptide pool from which it was derived. Some epitopes were tested twice and for E13a and E20 there were only sufficient cells to test the peptide pool in one assay.",
                                "As illustrated in Table 4, the epitope E1 (FLFVEALFQE) was active using the same volunteer (v58) that was tested with the parent Cp1-C3 15mer (Table 3), and NetMHC predicted the strongest binding to A*02:01 (A02 supertype). E1 was also positive with v156 who does not express A*02:01; however, E1 contains the 9mer FLFVEALFQ (epitope E1a in Table 4) that NetMHC predicted bound weakly (IC50=4312 nM) with A*03:01 (A03 supertype) that is expressed by v156. E2 (FVEALFQEY) was active using the same volunteer (v69) that was tested with the parent 15mers Cp1-C3 and Cp1-C4 (Table 3), and NetMHC predicted binding to B*35:01 (B07 supertype). In addition E2 was active with v127 and NetMHC predicted binding to A*01:01 (A01 supertype). E2 was also predicted to bind to A*01:01 using the Cp1-C3 15mer but for a different volunteer (v05, Table 3). Therefore we conclude that E2 is restricted by two allele groups, B*35:01 and A*01:01 that belong to different supertypes, B07 and A01 respectively. E3 (LFVEALFQEY) could not be tested with v12 that was positive with the parent Cp1-C4 15mer (Table 3). However, E3 was active with v69 and NetMHC predicted binding to A*30:02 (A01 supertype). E3 contains the 9mer E2 sequence (FVEALFQEY) that NetMHC predicted to bind to B*35:01 that is also expressed by v69. E3 was also positive with v127 and NetMHC predicted that the E2 sequence within E3 bound to A*01:01-restricted, matching v127. E13 (SVFNVVNSSI) was positive with v58 and was predicted to bind to A*02:01 (A02 supertype), and was also positive with v37 and predicted to bind with A*68:02 (Table 4) that like A*02:01 is part of the A02 supertype. E13 was also positive with v40 and NetMHC predicted that a 9mer sequence VFNVVNSSI contained within E13 (labeled E13a, Table 4) may bind (weakly) to A*23:01 (A24 supertype). E17 (LIMVLSFLFL) could not be tested with v01, v02, and v08 who responded to the parent Cp9-C65 15mer (Table 2). E17 was predicted as A*02:01-restricted for v01 and v02 (Table 3) and also as A*68:02-restricted (A02 supertype) for v08 with low binding (IC50, 816). E11 was positive with v156 who does not express A*02:01 or A*68.02. However, E17 contains the 9mer sequence LIMVLSFLF (E17a) and NetMHC predicted this sequence binds to A*29:02 (A01A24 supertype) that is expressed by v156.",
                                "Also illustrated in Table 4, E17a (LIMVLSFLF) was recognized by v37 and NetMHC predicted binding to B*15:03 (B27 supertype). E17a was also positive with v40 and NetMHC predicted binding to A*23:01 (A24 supertype). Therefore, we conclude that E17a ELISpot activity is restricted by three allele groups, A*29:02, B*15:03 and A*23:01 that are members of three HLA supertypes, A01A24, B27 and A24, respectively. E18 (AILSVSSFLF) was predicted as an A*23:01 restricted epitope using v40, but PBMC were not available from v40; however, E18 was positive with v63, which does not express A*23:01, but NetMHC predicted binding low/negative (IC505375) binding affinity of an epitope contained within E18 (E18a, AILSVSSFL) for A*24:03 that is expressed by v63. Both A*23:01 and A*24:03 are members of the A24 supertype. E19 (SVSSFLFVEA) was predicted to be A*68:02-restricted (A02 supertype) using v52, but PBMC were not available from this volunteer. E19 was moderately active with v125 but NetMHC could not predict binding to HLA alleles expressed by v125. However, v125 also expresses the A02 supertype (Table 1) and it is possible therefore that E19 may be sufficiently degenerate to bind to the A02 supertype expressed by v125. E20 (SFLFVEALF) was positive with v37 and v40 and NetMHC predicted binding to A*23:01 with v37. Although NetMHC did not return a prediction for v40, we assume that since v40 also expresses the A*23:01 allele group (Table 1), E20 is also restricted by A*2301 (A24 supertype) expressed by this volunteer. E20 was also moderately positive with v68 and NetMHC predicted binding to A*24:02 that like A*23:01 is a member of the A24 supertype. In addition, E20 was also positive with v156 and NetMHC could not predict binding to those HLA alleles expressed by v156. It is possible that E20 may be sufficiently degenerate to bind to allele groups expressed by v156 an A01A24 supertype. E21: (IMVLSFLFL) was predicted as binding to B*1503 using v37 from whom cells were not available. E21 gave a low to modest response against v125 but NetMHC could not predict binding to these HLA allele groups expressed by this volunteer and may also be an example of epitope degeneracy when binding cannot predicted by NetMHC.",

                                "The inventive recombinant construct has utility in the development of adenovirus-vectored vaccines (Ad-C and Ad-CA) designed to induce CD8+ T cell responses targeting pre-erythrocytic stage antigens. This approach is based on data indicating that CD8+ T cell responses are associated with protection against liver stage parasites in animal models and in humans (Sedegah, et al., PLoS One, 6: e24586 (2011); Tamminga, et al., PLoS One, 6: e25868 (2011)). The aim of this study was to better understand the immune responses elicited by CSP by mapping MHC class I restricted epitopes to aid the development of a broadly protective malaria vaccine for genetically diverse populations. To date, only a few class I-restricted epitopes have been described for this antigen (Calvo-Calle, et al., J. Immunol., 159: 1362-73 (1997); Doolan, et al., Immunity 7: 97-112 (1997); Aidoo, et al., Lancet, 345: 1003-7 (1995); Hill, et al., Nature, 352: 595-600 (1991)). We have previously demonstrated that CSP peptide pools containing overlapping 15mer peptides recalled CD8+ T cell responses using ELISpot and ICS (Sedegah, et al., PLoS One, 6: e24586 (2011); Tamminga, et al., PLoS One, 6: e25868 (2011)), and we decided to identify class 1-restricted 8-10mers within the four most active peptide pools Cp1, Cp2, Cp6 and Cp9. We used an integrated approach where the computer algorithm NetMHC (Lundegaard, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 36 (web server issue):W509-12 (2008)) was used to predict putative minimal class 1-restricted epitopes within 15mer CSP peptides that were active in ELISpot assay using Ad-C and Ad-CA immunized volunteers. Most HLA-restricted peptides have binding affinities of less than 50 nM, although some may bind in the 50-500 nM range (Sette, et al., Mol. Immunol., 31: 813-22 (1994)).",
                                "The predicted epitopes were synthesized and tested them using PBMCs from volunteers from the same clinical trials. Using this approach, 11 predicted HLA class I restricted minimal epitopes were identified. Six were confirmed to be recognized by CD8+ T cells using ELISpot depletion and ICS studies. A major constraint to these studies was the availability of PBMC from immunized volunteers. All the 11 epitopes confirmed in this study were novel and to our knowledge have not been previously described (Vaughan, et al., Parasite Immunol., 31: 78-97 (2009)).",
                                "While peptide binding to class I MHC molecules is required for T cell recognition, many peptides that bind with high affinity are not recognized by T cells (Sidney, et al., BMC Immunol., 9: 1 (2008)). Therefore, an attempt was made to demonstrate that these predicted epitopes were recognized by CD8+ T cells from Ad-C and Ad-CA-immunized volunteers. NetMHC was utilized to predict epitopes that likely matched the HLA alleles of volunteers for which PBMC were available. Despite the restricted availability of PBMC from immunized volunteers, six of the 11 epitopes that were active in ELISpot were demonstrated to recall CD8+ T cell responses. Since most class I-binding peptides are usually 8-10 amino acids, while class II peptides range from 12 to 24 residues (Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997); Chicz, et al., J. Exp. Med., 178: 27-47 (1993)), it is likely that all 11 epitopes are class I-restricted.",
                                "Predicated on earlier studies with P. falciparum epitopes, including CSP, it was presumed that there is a high degree of degeneracy such that minimal 8-10mer peptides bind to more than one HLA allele within different supertypes (Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997)). This was shown by E2 that was predicted to bind to A*01:01 and B*35:01, members of different HLA supertypes (A01 and B07), and Ella that was predicted to bind to A*23:01, A*2902 and B*15:03 (A24, A01A24 and B27 supertypes, respectively). In addition, E13 was predicted to bind to A*02:01 and A*68:02 (both members of the A02 supertype), and E20 was predicted to bind to A*23:01 and A*24:02 (both members of the A24 supertype). This is consistent with findings that many different HLA alleles overlap in their peptide-binding properties (Sidney, et al., J. Immunol., 154: 247-59 (1995); Sette and Sidney, Immunogenetics, 50: 201-12 (1999); Doolan, et al., Immunity, 7: 97-112 (1997); Sidney, et al., BMC Immunol., 9: 1 (2008); Sette and Sidney, Current Opin. Immunol., 10: 478-82 (1998); Sidney, et al., Hum. Immunol., 45: 79-93 (1996); Sidney, et al., J. Immunol., 157: 2480-90 (1996)).",
                                "Further examples were found when NetMHC predictions of the HLA-restrictions of peptides spanning the full length of CSP were analyzed suggesting that this HLA supertype promiscuity may be more extensive than demonstrated here. Promiscuous class I-restricted epitopes that recognize different HLA supertypes have been reported for viral diseases suggesting that many epitopes can be presented on different HLA alleles (Frahm, et al., J. Virol., 78: 2187-200 (2004); Frahm, et al., J. Immunol., 37: 2419-33 (2007)).",
                                "In other studies, certain allele pairs frequently shared epitopes (Frahm, et al., J. Immunol., 37: 2419-33 (2007)); however, the small number of epitopes identified in this study precluded such an analysis. As with class I epitopes studied here, CSP DR epitopes have been shown to be promiscuous. Recently, class II-restricted epitopes have been assigned to seven supertypes, reflecting a more pronounced dependence on backbone interactions than on peptide anchor residues (Greenbaum, et al., Immunogenetics, 63: 325-35 (2011)). This provides encouraging evidence that a CSP adenovirus-vectored vaccine may be immunogenic in genetically diverse populations.",
                                "Recent studies have suggested that the N-terminal region folds over and protects the C-terminal region of CSP, exposing only the N-terminal and repeat regions to binding antibodies (Coppi, et al., J. Exp. Med. 208: 341-56 (2011)). Surface location has been suggested to increase accessibility of HIV T-cell epitopes to the antigen-processing pathway (Surman, et al., PNAS (USA, 98: 4587-92 (2001); Sijts, et al., J. Immunol., 164: 4500-6 (2000)), and CSP peptide pools containing peptides spanning the N-terminal recalled strong CD8+ T cell responses in Ad-C and Ad-CA-immunized volunteers.",
                                "However, CSP peptide pools containing peptides spanning the C-terminal region also elicited similar strong CD8+ T cell responses, indicating that induction of strong CD8+ T cell responses is not related to CSP sequence localization. Part of the N-terminal region containing E1, E1a, E2, E3, E18, E19 and E20 is proteolytically cleaved during sporozoite invasion, while truncated CSP containing E13, E13a, E17a and E21 is carried into the hepatocyte (Coppi, et al., J. Exp. Med., 208: 341-56 (2011); Hollingdale, M. R., Prog Allergy, 41: 15-48 (1988)), suggesting that N- and C-terminal epitopes may be processed and presented to the immune system by different mechanisms.",
                                "Amino acid polymorphism may also be associated with surface accessibility or immune pressure (Thera, et al., PLoS One, 3: e1465 (2008); Zevering, et al., Immunology, 94: 445-54 (1998); Escalante, et al., Mol. Biochem. Parasitol., 125: 83-90 (2002))."
