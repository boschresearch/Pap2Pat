# DESCRIPTION

## STATEMENT OF FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

- acknowledge funding

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION

- define field

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

- discuss limitations

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

- introduce invention

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

- describe novel population of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from root apical papilla of human teeth and methods for repairing damaged tooth using these stem cells

### EXAMPLES

- isolate and characterize SCAP and PDLSCs from human teeth
- demonstrate odontogenic and osteogenic differentiation of SCAP in vitro and in vivo
- show surface molecule characterization of SCAP and functional tooth regeneration using SCAP and PDLSCs in swine model
- discuss implications of SCAP for functional tooth regeneration and potential for autologous transplantation

### Example 1

- isolate and transplant SCAP to regenerate dentin and cementum in immunocompromised mice

### Example 2

- characterize surface molecules of SCAP and demonstrate their distinctness from DPSCs

### Example 3

- demonstrate functional tooth regeneration using SCAP and PDLSCs in swine model

## Discussion

- discuss implications of SCAP for functional tooth regeneration and potential for autologous transplantation
