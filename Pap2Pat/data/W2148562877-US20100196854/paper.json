    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration is a promising approach for regenerative medicine for a wide range of applications. Here we report a new population of stem cells isolated from the root apical papilla of human teeth (SCAP, stem cells from apical papilla). Using a minipig model, we transplanted both human SCAP and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) to generate a root/periodontal complex capable of supporting a porcelain crown, resulting in normal tooth function. This work integrates a stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration strategy, engineered materials for structure, and current dental crown technologies. This hybridized tissue engineering approach led to recovery of tooth strength and appearance.",

                "Regeneration of a functional and living tooth is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for the replacement of a diseased or damaged tooth [1]\u2013[3]. Recent advances in dental stem cell biotechnology and cell-mediated murine tooth regeneration have encouraged researchers to explore the potential for regenerating living teeth with appropriate functional properties [4]\u2013[6]. Murine teeth can be regenerated using many different stem cells to collaboratively form dental structures in vivo [4], [5], [7]. In addition, dentin/pulp tissue and cementum/periodontal complex have been regenerated by human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), respectively, when transplanted into immunocompromised mice [8], [9]. However, owing to the complexity of human tooth growth and development, the regeneration of a whole tooth structure including enamel, dentin/pulp complex, and periodontal tissues as a functional entity in humans not possible given available regenerative biotechnologies.",
                "The spatially and temporally organized microenvironment of the tooth bud and its surrounding tissues permits growth and development of the crown and roots, resulting in formation and eruption of the tooth [10]. Root development involves dentin formation, cementum generation, instruction of epithelium, and tooth eruption. From a clinical perspective, the most important part of the tooth is the root which supports for a (natural or artificial) crown. The crown alone cannot fulfill normal tooth function without a viable root. In contrast, the wide use of synthetic crowns to replace a damaged natural crowns has been widely applied in dental clinics with excellent therapeutic outcomes [11].",
                "Although dental implant therapies have achieved long-term success in the clinic for the recovery of tooth function, the dental implants require pre-existing high-quality bone structures for supporting the implants [12], [13]. Reconstruction of teeth in patients without adequate bone support would be a major advance. Stem cell-mediated root regeneration offers opportunities to regenerate a bio-root and its associated periodontal tissues, which are necessary for maintaining the physiological function of teeth. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for reconstructing a functional tooth in miniature pigs (minipigs), in which a bio-root periodontal complex is built up by postnatal stem cells including stem cells from root apical papilla (SCAP) and PDLSCs, to which an artificial porcelain crown is affixed. This hybrid strategy of autologous dental stem cell engineering may be applicable to human tooth regeneration. Furthermore, functional tooth restoration in swine may shed light on human tooth regeneration in the future because of the close similarities between swine and human dental tissues [14], [15]."

                        "The mechanism of the contribution of stem progenitors to root formation remains to be elucidated. Here, we found that human root apical papilla tissue on the exterior of the root foramen area demonstrated positive staining for mesenchymal stem cell surface molecule STRO-1 (Figure 1A). The root apical papilla might contain a population of stem/progenitor cells. To identify putative stem cells, single-cell suspensions were generated from human root apical papillae collected from extracted third molars of 18\u201320 years old adult volunteers, following collagenase/dispase digestion. When cultured at a low cell density, they formed adherent clonogenic cell clusters (CFU-F, colony forming unit, fibroblastic) (Figure 1B), similar to those observed for various mesenchymal stem cell populations. To investigate the potential of SCAP to undergo odontoblastic/osteoblastic differentiation, multiple colony-derived SCAP at passage two were supplemented with L-ascorbate-2-phosphate, dexamethasone, and inorganic phosphate to induce mineralization in vitro as described previously [8], [9]. Small round Alizarin Red-positive nodules formed in the SCAP cultures after four weeks of induction, indicating calcium accumulation in vitro (Figure 1C). Moreover, cultured SCAP were capable of differentiating into other cell types such as adipocytes (Figure 1D), analogous to DPSCs and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) [8].",
                        "To validate the capacity of SCAP to differentiate into functional dentinogenic cells, ex vivo expanded-SCAP were transplanted into immunocompromised mice, with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) as a carrier. A typical dentin structure was regenerated, in which a layer of dentin tissue formed on the surface of the HA/TCP along with connective tissue (Figure 1E). The newly formed dentin was positive for anti-DSP antibody staining, and dentin-forming cells stained with anti-human-specific mitochondria antibody (Figure 1F\u2013H), suggesting that the donor derived human SCAP had formed the dentin in vivo. In order to prepare for autologous dental stem cells for functional tooth regeneration in swine, we isolated single colony-derived swine SCAP and PDLSCs and transplanted them into immunocompromised mice to regenerate dentin and cementum, respectively (Figure 1I\u20131L), equivalent to that of human SCAP and PDLSCs.",
                        "We next addressed whether SCAP and DSPCs were the same or distinct mesenchymal stem cell populations, because both expressed osteo/odontogenic markers and generate mineralized tissue when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. First, we collected SCAP and DPSCs from the same human tooth and grew them under exactly same conditions. According to a cDNA microarray profile comparison (data not shown), there are many genes differentially expressed between these two stem cell populations. Among these genes, we selected survivin as one example, and confirmed its higher expression in SCAP by western blot (Figure 2A). We also identified that CD 24 as a specific surface marker of SCAP by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 2B). During odontogenic differentiation in vitro, SCAP lost the expression of CD24 with an up-regulated expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Figure 3B). In addition, SCAP showed a significantly higher rate of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake (Figure 2C), and increased number of population doublings (Figure 2D). The SCAP population also demonstrated an elevated tissue regeneration capacity (Figure 2E), higher telomerase activity than that of DPSCs from the same tooth (Figure 2F), and an improved migration capacity in a scratch assay (Figure 2G), when compared to DPSCs from the same tooth. Collectively, these studies suggested that SCAP are a unique population of postnatal stem cells distinct from DPSC."

STRO-1 and CD146 have been identified as early mesenchymal stem cell markers present on both BMMSCs and DPSCs [8], [16]. Here we found that CD24 appears to be a specific marker for SCAP, not detectable in other mesenchymal stem cells including DPSCs and BMMSCs (data not shown). In response to osteogenic induction conditions in culture, SCAP begin to down regulate their expression of CD24 while gaining expression of ALP (Figure 3B). Our experimental evidence suggests that SCAP derived from a developing tissue may represent a population of early progenitors that have advantages for use in tissue regeneration."

To play a functional role in vivo, the root has to connect with the periodontal ligament to ensure correct positional stability and support in situ. Therefore, we used both human SCAP and PDLSCs to generate dentin and PDL on a HA/TCP carrier, in order to mimic a bio-physiological root/periodontal set-up in vivo. Eight weeks after transplantation, the human PDLSCs were able to form cementum on the surface of HA/TCP carrier and Sharpey's fibers, characterized histologically to have collagen fibers anchored into the cementum (Figure 4 A, B). These data suggested that use of combined mesenchymal stem cell populations provide a basis for root/periodontal tissue regeneration.",
                        "To accomplish functional tooth regeneration, we used swine because of the similarities in swine and human orofacial tissue organization. Swine SCAP were loaded into a root-shaped HA/TCP block that contained an inner post channel space to allow the subsequent installation of a porcelain crown (Figure 5A). A lower incisor was extracted and the extraction socket was further cleaned with a surgical bur to remove remaining periodontal tissues (Figure 5A). The HA/TCP block containing SCAP was coated with Gelfoam (Pharmacia Canada Inc., Ontario, Canada) containing PDLSCs and inserted into the socket and sutured for 3 months (Figure 5B\u2013E). CT examination revealed a HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSC structure growing inside the socket with mineralized root-like tissue formation and periodontal ligament space. The surface of the implanted HA/SCAP-Gelfoam/PDLSC structure was surgically re-opened at three months post-implantation, and a pre-fabricated porcelain crown resembling a minipig incisor was inserted and cemented into the pre-formed post channel inside the HA/TCP block (Figure 5F\u2013H). After suture of the surgical opening, the porcelain crown was retained in situ and subjected to the process of tooth function for four weeks (Figure 5I, J). CT and histologic analysis confirmed that the root/periodontal structure had regenerated (Figure 5K\u2013M). Moreover, newly formed bio-roots demonstrated a significantly improved compressive strength than that of original HA/TCP carriers after six-month implantation (Figure 5N). These findings suggest the feasibility of using a combination of autologous SCAP/PDLSCs in conjunction with artificial dental crowns for functional tooth regeneration."

                "It is generally believed that the dental papilla contributes to tooth formation and eventually converts to pulp tissue within the pulp chamber. In this study, we found that the root apical papilla contained mesenchymal stem cells that appear to have a greater capacity for dentin regeneration than DPSCs. These findings suggest that developing tissue may contain a good stem cell resource for tissue regeneration. SCAP represent a novel population of multipotent stem cells as demonstrated by their capacity to develop into odontoblast-like cells and adipocytes in vitro. This cell population was found to express high levels of survivin and telomerase, which are both important molecules in mediating cell proliferation. In addition, CD24, marker for undifferentiated SCAP, which is downregulated following odontogenic differentiation. These data support the notion that SCAP are a unique population of postnatal stem cells.",
                "Although dental pulp contains DPSCs with dentin/pulp regenerative capacity, developing tissue-derived SCAP showed a superior tissue regeneration potential than that of DPSCs. SCAP collected from just one tooth are capable of providing a large number of stem cells probably sufficient for human transplantation because they have high proliferative potential, reflected in high telomerase activity [17]. Human SCAP-mediated tissue regeneration may offer a promising cell-based therapy for root regeneration.",
                "Since most human tissue at the developing stage is not clinically available for stem cell isolation, this apical papilla stem cell population, accessible in dental clinical practice, is unusual. SCAP can be isolated from extracted wisdom teeth. Therefore, it may be possible to bank these high quality dental stem cells for future autologous use. Their survival in freeze-thawing requires exploration. Allogeneic cells may be another resource of stem cells for treating those aged individuals who have already have had their wisdom teeth extracted, however the immunogenicity of these cells requires further study.",
                "Although newly formed bio-roots show a lower compressive strength than that of natural swine root dentin, they seemed capable of supporting porcelain crown and resulted in normal functions. It may be possible to improve the compressive strength and hardness of the bio-roots by selecting optimal bioengineered materials and by optimizing the implanted stem cell numbers and quality. Stem cell-mediated root regeneration hybridized with clinical crown technology may be a promising approach for functional tooth restoration owing to the availability of high-quality dental stem cells for autologous transplantation as well as long-term experience with clinical dental implant procedures. In addition, the orofacial region is an open system for directly delivering stem cells for tissue engineering. Our studies demonstrate that minipigs offer an excellent translational model for the concept of functional tooth regeneration and the feasibility of using autologous stem cells for transplantation."

A newly formed bio-root was harvested six months after transplant, and divided into three pieces. Compressive strength of each piece was measured separately. Compressive strength of natural minipig roots and original HA/TCP carriers were also measured (n\u200a=\u200a5, each group)."
