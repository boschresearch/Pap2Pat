                                "Titanium alloys typically exhibit a high strength-to-weight ratio, are corrosion resistant, and are resistant to creep at moderately high temperatures. For example, Ti-5Al-4Mo-4Cr-2Sn-2Zr alloy (also denoted \u201cTi-17 alloy,\u201d having a composition specified in UNS R58650) is a commercial alloy that is widely used for jet engine applications requiring a combination of high strength, fatigue resistance, and toughness at operating temperatures up to 800\u00b0 F. Other examples of titanium alloys used for high temperature applications include Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo alloy (having a composition specified in UNS R54620) and Ti-3Al-8V-6Cr-4Mo-4Zr alloy (also denoted \u201cBeta-C\u201d, having a composition specified in UNS R58640). However, there are limits to creep resistance at elevated temperatures in these alloys.

It will be understood that titanium alloy compositions described herein \u201ccomprising\u201d, \u201cconsisting of\u201d, or \u201cconsisting essentially of\u201d a particular composition also may include impurities.",
                        "Articles and parts in high temperature environments may suffer from creep. As used herein, \u201chigh temperature\u201d refers to temperatures in excess of about 200\u00b0 F. Creep is time-dependent strain occurring under stress. Creep occurring at a diminishing strain rate is referred to as primary creep; creep occurring at a minimum and almost constant strain rate is referred to as secondary (steady-state) creep; and creep occurring at an accelerating strain rate is referred to as tertiary creep. Creep strength is the stress that will cause a given creep strain in a creep test at a given time in a specified constant environment.",
                        "The creep resistance behavior of titanium and titanium alloys at high temperature and under a sustained load depends primarily on microstructural features. Titanium has two allotropic forms: a beta (\u201c\u03b2\u201d)-phase, which has a body centered cubic (\u201cbcc\u201d) crystal structure; and an alpha (\u201c\u03b1\u201d)-phase, which has a hexagonal close packed (\u201chcp\u201d) crystal structure. In general, \u03b2 titanium alloys exhibit poor elevated-temperature creep strength. The poor elevated-temperature creep strength is a result of the significant concentration of \u03b2 phase these alloys exhibit at elevated temperatures such as, for example, 900\u00b0 F. \u03b2 phase does not resist creep well due to its body centered cubic structure, which provides for a large number of deformation mechanisms. As a result of these shortcomings, the use of \u03b2 titanium alloys has been limited.",
                        "One group of titanium alloys widely used in a variety of applications is the \u03b1/\u03b2 titanium alloy. In \u03b1/\u03b2 titanium alloys, the distribution and size of the primary \u03b1 particles can directly impact creep resistance. According to various published accounts of research on \u03b1/\u03b2 titanium alloys containing silicon, the precipitation of silicides at the grain boundaries can further improve creep resistance, but to the detriment of room temperature tensile ductility. The reduction in room temperature tensile ductility that occurs with silicon addition limits the concentration of silicon that can be added, typically, to 0.3% (by weight).",
                        "The present disclosure, in part, is directed to alloys that address certain of the limitations of conventional titanium alloys.

In certain non-limiting embodiments according to the present disclosure, molybdenum may be present in weight concentrations, based on total alloy weight, of 0-5%. In certain non-limiting embodiments, molybdenum may be present in weight concentrations, based on total alloy weight, of 1.3-2.3%, or in certain embodiments, 1.7-2.1%.",
                        "Zirconium may be included in the alloys according to the present disclosure to increase alpha content, provide increased strength and provide increased creep resistance by forming an intermetallic precipitate. In certain non-limiting embodiments according to the present disclosure, zirconium may be present in weight concentrations, based on total alloy weight, of 1-10%. In certain non-limiting embodiments, zirconium may be present in weight concentrations, based on total alloy weight, of 3.4-4.4%, or in certain embodiments, 3.5-4.3%.",
                        "Silicon may be included in the alloys according to the present disclosure to provide increased creep resistance by forming an intermetallic precipitate.

In certain non-limiting embodiments, germanium may be present in weight concentrations, based on total alloy weight, of 0.1-2.0%, or in certain embodiments, 0.1-0.4%. Without intending to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the germanium content of the alloys in conjunction with a suitable heat treatment may promote precipitation of a zirconium-silicon-germanium intermetallic precipitate. The germanium additions can be by, for example, pure metal or a master alloy of germanium and one or more other suitable metallic elements. Si\u2014Ge and Al\u2014Ge may be suitable examples of master alloys. Certain master alloys may be in powder, pellets, wire, crushed chips, or sheet form. The titanium alloys described herein are not limited in this regard. After final melting to achieve a substantially homogeneous mixture of titanium and alloying elements, the cast ingot can be thermo-mechanically worked through one or more steps of forging, rolling, extruding, drawing, swaging, upsetting, and annealing to achieve the desired microstructure. It is to be understood that the alloys of the present disclosure may be thermo-mechanically worked and/or treated by other suitable methods.",

As used herein, a \u201csolution treating and aging (STA)\u201d process refers to a heat treating process applied to titanium alloys that includes solution treating a titanium alloy at a solution treating temperature below the \u03b2-transus temperature of the titanium alloy. In a non-limiting embodiment, the solution treating temperature is in a temperature range from about 1780\u00b0 F. to about 1800\u00b0 F. The solution treated alloy is subsequently aged by heating the alloy for a period of time to an aging temperature range that is less than the \u03b2-transus temperature and less than the solution treating temperature of the titanium alloy. As used herein, terms such as \u201cheated to\u201d or \u201cheating to,\u201d etc., with reference to a temperature, a temperature range, or a minimum temperature, mean that the alloy is heated until at least the desired portion of the alloy has a temperature at least equal to the referenced or minimum temperature, or within the referenced temperature range throughout the portion's extent. In a non-limiting embodiment, a solution treatment time ranges from about 30 minutes to about 4 hours. It is recognized that in certain non-limiting embodiments, the solution treatment time may be shorter than 30 minutes or longer than 4 hours and is generally dependent upon the size and cross-section of the titanium alloy. Upon completion of the solution treatment, the titanium alloy is cooled to ambient temperature at a rate depending on a cross-sectional thickness of the titanium alloy.",

The electrodes were remelted in a vacuum arc remelt (VAR) furnace to produce 10 inch diameter ingots. Each ingot was converted to a 3 inch diameter billet using a hot working press. After a 13 forging step to 7 inch diameter, an \u03b1+\u03b2 prestrain forging step to 5 inch diameter, and a \u03b2 finish forging step to 3 inch diameter, the ends of each billet were cropped to remove suck-in and end-cracks, and the billets were cut into multiple pieces.

Referring to FIG. 2, an elemental scan by energy dispersive x-rays (EDS) of Experimental Titanium Alloy No. 2 prior to creep exposure showed a substantially uniform distribution of germanium in the \u03b1/\u03b2 microstructure without the intermetallic particles. In FIGS. 3-4, partitioning of zirconium, silicon, and germanium to intermetallic particles is visible after the creep exposure. The intermetallic particles generally exhibit depletion of aluminum relative to the surrounding alpha particle. The precipitation of the intermetallic particles after the creep exposure was particularly unexpected and surprising. Without intending to be bound to any theory, it is believed that the intermetallic particles may improve secondary creep for the alloys without substantially impacting high temperature yield strength.",
