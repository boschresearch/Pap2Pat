                        "Protein translation is a highly efficient and accurate process for assembling the 20 standard amino acids into proteins. Error rates in translation are relatively rare (1 in 103 to 104) and rely on the ability of the system to discriminate between the 20 protein (or canonical) amino acids (Zaher, et al., Cell 136, 746-762 (2009)). However such rare errors which result in the mischarging of tRNA synthetase by the wrong amino acid can result in misfolded or truncated proteins, and subsequent cell damage, such as in the sti (sticky) mutation in mice where alanine is substituted for glutamic acid, resulting in neurodegeneration (Lee, et al., Nature 443, 50-55 (2006)). We here report that a nonprotein amino acid produced by cyanobacteria, \u03b2-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), can be mistakenly incorporated into human proteins. We also report that this misincorporation can be inhibited by L-serine.",
                        "Protein translation is the process whereby the genetic code is interpreted from information contained in the nucleic acid sequence in mRNA into the primary sequence of a polypeptide chain. Fidelity of protein synthesis, at the translational level, relies on the specificity of amino acid and cognate tRNA recognition by tRNA synthetases. In certain cases, when two protein amino acids have a similar structure, a proofreading step checks the \u201cfit\u201d of an amino acid to the catalytic site of the tRNA synthetase and the bond is hydrolysed if the wrong amino acid is bound (Zaher, et al., Cell 136, 746-762 (2009)). Hundreds of non-protein amino acids exist; many occur naturally in plants, some are produced in vivo from amino acid oxidation, others are synthetically produced (Rubenstein, et al. Medicine (Baltimore) 79, 80-89 (2000); Rodgers, et al., Free Radic Biol Med 32, 766-775 (2002); Rodgers, et al., Int J Biochem Cell Bio 40, 1452-1466 (2008); Bell, J Agric Food Chem 51, 2854-2865 (2003)). Nonprotein amino acids which are close structural analogues of any of the 20 protein amino acids can bind to an amino acid-tRNA synthetase and become mistakenly peptide bonded into a polypeptide chain (Rodgers, et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol 40, 1452-1466 (2008)). In order to be incorporated into proteins, non-protein amino acids have to be present in the cell at sufficient levels to successfully compete with the protein amino acid for charging onto tRNA. Examples of non-protein amino acids which are misincorporated into proteins causing pathological effects include cavananine and L-DOPA (Rubenstein, et al. Medicine (Baltimore) 79, 80-89 (2000); Rodgers, et al., Int J Biochem Cell Biol 40, 1452-1466 (2008); Allende, et al., J Biol Chem 239, 1102-1106 (1964); Rosenthal, et al., Science 196, 658-660 (1977); Rosenthal Quarterly Review of Biology, 52, 155-178 (1977)).",
                        "BMAA has been found to be associated with proteins in cyanobacteria and other organisms (Banack, et al., Mar Drugs 5, 180-196 (2007); Cox, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102, 5074-5078 (2005); Murch, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101, 12228-12231 (2004)). The possibility that the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA is misincorporated into proteins was bolstered by a study in which autoradiographic analysis was performed on mice after a single injection of 3H-BMAA reported \u2018a distribution pattern similar to that of a protein-forming amino acid\u2019 (Karlsson, et al., Pigment Cell Melanoma Res 22, 120-130 (2009)). 3H-BMAA uptake was demonstrated in tissues with high levels of protein synthesis, and radioactivity was maintained in the tissue after acid extraction (Karlsson, et al., Pigment Cell Melanoma Res 22, 120-130 (2009)). These data are consistent with incorporation of BMAA by protein synthesis.",

APP is a membrane protein that contains Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal-ion binding sites in the tail portion that contains the A\u03b2 region. Though A\u03b2 containing plaques are part of the pathology of the disease, very little is known about the function of both this smaller peptide and the full-length APP. The plaque inducing 42-amino acid long A\u03b2 protein is produced from the normal cleavage of APP into the various subforms. There are two pathways for APP shown in the figure at right, indicating the amyloidogenic path (left) to A\u03b2, sAPP\u03b2 and C99 or the non-amyloidogenic path (right) to p3, sAPP\u03b2, and C83.",

A therapeutic benefit or treatment efficacy of a neurological disorder or disease (or severity of a neurological disorder or disease) can also be ascertained or measured by mechanical means or instrumentation. In particular, positron electron tomography (PET) scan of the brain of a person with a neurological disorder or disease can show the degree to which there is a loss of function. Imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or with single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can also be used to identify cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia-in order to ascertain therapeutic benefit or treatment efficacy of a neurological disorder or disease, or severity of a neurological disorder or disease.",

                        "For Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), diagnosis is primarily based on the symptoms and signs, and tests to rule out other diseases. A neurologic examination is used to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, hyper-reflexia, and spasticity are present, and over time, become progressively worse. One of these tests that distinguishes ALS from other diseases or disorders having similar symptoms is electromyography (EMG), a recording technique that detects electrical activity in muscles. Certain EMG findings can support the diagnosis of ALS. Another common test measures nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Specific abnormalities in NCV may suggest, for example, that the patient has a form of peripheral neuropathy (damage to peripheral nerves) or myopathy (muscle disease) rather than ALS. MRI scans are often normal in patients with ALS, but it can reveal evidence of other problems that may be causing the symptoms, such as a spinal cord tumor, a herniated disk in the neck, syringomyelia, or cervical spondylosis.",

                        "For Huntington's disease (HD), diagnosis of onset can be made following the appearance of physical and/or psychological symptoms specific to the disease, as set for the herein, for example. Excessive unintentional movements of any part of the body, which are abrupt and have random timing and distribution, suggest a diagnosis of HD. Cognitive or psychiatric symptoms are rarely the first diagnosed; they are usually only recognized in hindsight or when they develop further. Disease progression can be measured using the unified Huntington's disease rating scale which provides an overall rating based on motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional assessments. Medical imaging, such as CT and MRI, can show atrophy of the caudate nuclei early in the disease, but these changes alone are not diagnostic of HD. Cerebral atrophy can be seen in the advanced stages of the disease. Genetic testing can be used to confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before onset of symptoms, a genetic test can confirm if an individual carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide CAG repeats in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Because HD follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, individuals who are at risk can be readily identified. A positive result can be obtained many years before symptoms begin. A negative test means that the individual does not carry the expanded copy of the gene and will not develop HD.",

The PD Society Brain Bank criteria requires slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability, while ruling out other possible causes for these symptoms. In addition, three or more of the following features are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskenisias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.",
                        "For Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), diagnosis is primarily clinical including changed behaviors, changes in language, combined with neuropsychological tests and imaging. Structural MRI scans often reveal frontal lobe and/or anterior temporal lobe atrophy, but in early cases the scan may appear normal. Atrophy is often asymmetric. Comparison of images taken at different time points (e.g. a year apart) can show evidence of atrophy in two cross-sectional images that may be reported as normal. FDG-PET scans classically show frontal and/or anterior temporal hypometabolism, which also helps differentiate FTD from Alzheimer's disease.",

Retention times, unique daughter ions, and ratios of m/z transitions during collision-induced dissociation matched those of an authenticated BMAA standard (FIG. 5A).

In cells incubated for 96 hours with BMAA (300 \u03bcM), autofluorescent bodies were evident in the nucleus, cytosol and in the perinuclear space (FIG. 6A).

Apoptosis could be abrogated by co-incubation with L-serine as well as by CHX, which provides further evidence that this process is dependent upon BMAA incorporation into the protein chain (FIG. 6E).

The column will be washed and proteins containing BMAA will be eluted from the column as a semi-pure solution. The use of such columns allows us to rapidly purify protein solutions such that there is a greater likelihood of obtaining proteins containing BMAA. Once isolated, the proteins will be digested using enzymes before analysis of the fragments using mass spectrometry and protein analysis software.",

                                "Based on the above considerations L-Serine and its structural derivatives are expected to function as both a prophylactic that can prevent human progressive degenerative illness, as well as a treatment that will slow the progression of symptoms in patients who have been diagnosed with progressive neurodegenerative illness.",
                                "Human clinical trials will be performed to determine if L-Serine can slow the progression of ALS and Alzheimer's, or possibly even prevent their occurrence. To approve any compound as a drug, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires three different phases of human clinical trials. Phase I trials typically involve a small number of patients (10-12) with the disease, and are designed to see if the drug is safe and well-tolerated by patients. Phase II trials involve more patients (30-60) and are designed to see if the drug is effective in treating the disease. Phase III trials are designed to reconfirm both safety and efficacy, and to determine possible side effects. These trials typically involve 300-500 patients.",
                                "Based on the in vitro and in vivo data previously detailed, it would be unethical to present ALS patients with a placebo in a randomized double-blind clinical trial. Accordingly, historical data on control ALS patients from previous clinical trials conducted by the Phoenix Neurological Associates and others will be used.",
                                "In the current design, a Phase I open label trial of 20 ALS patients will receive L-Serine orally at doses ranging from 500 mg/day to 30 g/day for six months. ALS Inclusion Criteria: Age 18-85; Male or Female; clinically diagnosed with probable or definite ALS based on El Escorial criteria; ALS-FRS score>25; and able to provide informed consent to and comply with all medical procedures. ALS Exclusion Criteria: Patients with FVC below 60%; evidence of any MND for over 3 years; any other co-morbid condition that could make completion of trial unlikely; history of intolerance to L-serine; taking any other trial medications; and if female, pregnant or breast-feeding, or if of childbearing age, any unwillingness to prevent pregnancy until trials are completed;",
                                "Although the Phase I trial is designed to demonstrate safety of L-Serine dosing for ALS patients, within these dose ranges there could be a possible slowing of the reduction in symptoms by using the ALSFRS-R, a rating of progressive Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis based on clinical symptoms. In addition, blood plasma and cerebral spinal fluid samples will be withdrawn and analyzed using triple quadrupole LC/MS/MS and Orbital trap LC/MS/MS to determine degree of BMAA misincorporation in neuroproteins, plasma L-Serine levels. Staining and fluorescent microscopy studies similar to those detailed herein will be used to detect protein aggregates and degree of misfolding of key proteins associated with progressive neurodegeneration. In addition, neuroproteins that are particularly vulnerable to BMAA misincorporation will be identified using orbital trap mass spectrometry."
