- introduce self-consistent parallel imaging with temporal sensitivity estimation (TSPIRIT)
- describe acquisition of magnetic resonance data
- perform initial linear reconstruction
- filter frames temporally
- estimate coil sensitivity information
- perform non-linear reconstruction using estimated kernels
- combine reconstructed data from different coils
- generate output images
- describe system for parallel imaging with temporal sensitivity
- summarize benefits of TSPIRIT
